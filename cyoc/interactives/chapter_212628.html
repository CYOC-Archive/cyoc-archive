<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Buster Trader: The Great Jock Trade Off! Chapter 4<br />
<br />
Lex was still just absorbing his new reality. His face had changed. He looked at himself in the bathroom mirror before heading out to lunch. He just couldn&#39;t help it. He really was a stud. His eyes were a bit squinty like his father but his long hair was gone. It was short and stood up straight. His face was much wider and symmetrical, his nose was perfect sized for his face and his lips were perfect for wearing a smirk. His jaw was big and strong. His body, though...it really was incredible. For a 17 year old young man, he looked more like a 22 year old bodybuilder brimming with testosterone. <br />
<br />
When he had encountered Colt, he found people calling the much smaller boy the name &quot;Kelly&quot; which made him laugh out loud. Kelly! Colt now even had a girl&#39;s name! Colt had similar facial features to before. Before he had strawberry blond hair but now it was curly, greasy and black as Lex&#39;s used to be. Colt, now Kelly, was just over 5 feet tall. A total shrimp boat! Lex was big and tall now! 6 foot 2 inches!<br />
<br />
Why was that so funny? He found himself chuckling over how smaller other guys could be. Shorter guys were so funny to look at! He frowned. He never would have laughed about someone&#39;s height before...<br />
<br />
He flexed his incredible muscles. His chest was fun to play with now. His pecs lifted his shirt off in two large mounds that were solid, firm, powerful natural armor. His arms were immense football sized, the size of cantaloupes. His shoulders...he didn&#39;t even HAVE shoulder muscles before! <br />
<br />
A boy coming into the bathroom caught him mid flex and said nothing, just looked to the ground as he passed Lex to go into a stall. Kid probably doesn&#39;t have a dick like MINE, a real big man dick! <br />
<br />
Why do I keep thinking this way? Lex shook his head and went to the lunchroom. <br />
<br />
He took his heaping meal (the lunch ladies gave him twice the amount of food because he was a jock and they knew he needed it...he didn&#39;t even have to ask) to the cool kids table. He had traveled in time and yet he knew everyone. Two girls automatically sat on his left and right so that they could vie for his attention. He was eating up the attention as usual. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lex, can you take me to the winter formal? Please?&quot; Bree batted her eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, please take me. I wanted to go with him!&quot; Leah whined. Both girls were long and dark haired with model looks, <br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, girls,&quot; Lex told then with perfectly charming pitch. He spread out his arms so they both fell into his loving embrace as he comforted them. &quot;You can BOTH go with me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t take two girls to the ball. Wait, can he?&quot; Marcus asked. He was one of the perfect jocks at this new school. Lex had just met him but he remembered Marcus was his bud. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see any reason why not. Do you girls?&quot; He caressed their arms gently. They both responded to his Alpha touch immediately with little sighs. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hate sharing you,&quot; Bree said. &quot;BUT. I wouldn&#39;t share anyone else.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been taking turns with me. This way...everyone&#39;s happy,&quot; he said, turning to Leah, who looked up at his perfect smile sheepishly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that&#39;s okay. As long as the teachers don&#39;t get mad.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t tell them,&quot; Bree rolled her eyes. &quot;Do you want to see the dress I&#39;m going to wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; <br />
<br />
Lex chuckled as Bree shuffled seats to sit next to her best friend, inviting her over to her house later. Cel phones weren&#39;t a thing here, he thought suddenly. They were still expensive and not many people had them. <br />
<br />
He devoured his lunch happily. His bros exchanged glances over what a lucky bastard he was. He couldn&#39;t help being loved! he thought. <br />
<br />
After lunch, he wandered out into the quad and saw a man in a trench coat and fedora smoking a cigarette, giving some Camels to a few juniors who were lighting up and thanking him. He waved a hand at them, blowing smoke with a practiced exhale, and wore a dismissive, slightly aggressive expression. <br />
<br />
&quot;You like the new universe so far, boyo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s amazing but...why do I feel so good? Like...I&#39;m not really acting like me. I&#39;m...happy!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah, in order to grant your request, I had to change a few things around. It&#39;s another universe, I just shifted you slightly. I specialize in transformation but I needed you to uh...be a little bit less like you. See, taking on Colt&#39;s life means taking on certain...personality quirks.&quot; Buster took a drag of his cigarette. &quot;I assume you have no problem with that. I mean, I could turn you back into a sadsack gay loser with no friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm. I dunno. I&#39;ve turned into a big straight jock and everyone seems to love me here!&quot; <br />
<br />
A girl in skimpy clothes went running by. Lex stared and drooled as she passed him by. <br />
<br />
&quot;You might find that this new identity is...rather powerful. You might start behaving more like Colt. You uh...noticing any aggressive tendencies yet?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bullying. Have you bullied anyone yet?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No. I would never do that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;OH wouldn&#39;t you? That guy did a number on you. You don&#39;t want to get even with little Colt...er...Kelly?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It IS pretty funny that you gave him a girls&#39; name! Haha! Faggot!&quot; Lex covered his mouth. &quot;Okay...I see what you mean. I keep having these thoughts like...I&#39;m better than other guys! I&#39;ve never thought that way before!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You never had an Alpha body before. That Alpha brain of yours can be a really powerful thing. You uh...sure you can handle it? The same rules apply in this world. You can get in big trouble if you get caught throwing some little nerd around. <br />
<br />
&quot;I would never do that. I&#39;m the top dog around here. Everyone loves me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so, pal. Hey, I&#39;ve got another client to meet with. I&#39;ll touch base with you again later, okay bud?&quot; <br />
<br />
Buster walked off and disappeared around the brick gate at the front of the school. <br />
<br />
Lex heard some friends of his call his name and he happily joined them. He wasn&#39;t some little loser like Kelly. Everyone wanted to be friends with a BIG, STRONG MAN. Not some punk emo kid, hahaha! <br />
<br />
Wow...my personality really has changed, he thought. And I like it!<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s toss a football! Lex, you in?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m always in!&quot; <br />
<br />
Though, baseball is more my sport of choice. I still love football, volleyball, pretty much any sport where I get to show off my huge arms! <br />
<br />
He smiled. Life was good.<br />
<br />
In the distance, on the far side of the court, the new Colt adjusted his glasses. He had been chased several times by angry jocks. He felt like crying but was keeping it to himself. He ran his hands through his long, curly, greasy and rather effeminate looking hair. All of his clothes were black and he felt nothing but resentment and disdain for everyone. Even his name had changed, but he liked &quot;Kelly&quot; more than Colt. It felt more like himself, more...free of gender stereotypes. <br />
<br />
Someone tripped him and laughed. He didn&#39;t see who it was but he landed with a thump and some girls laughed at his pathetic dweeb body as he hobbled to gym class. <br />
<br />
He was having a really bad day, he thought glumly. There was that damn nerd who took his life. Buster Trader had materialized in his new room after he&#39;d woken up. He had informed him that he was being punished for being an asshole jock and that reality had changed to reflect that Lex was now the Big Man on Campus and we was a gay emo kid that everyone mocked mercilessly. He stared at Lex&#39;s brawny new body and drooled. <br />
<br />
I wish he wasn&#39;t so good looking, he thought bitterly, and stared at Lex&#39;s features. He had such a beautiful face now. Wide and big. Everything about Lex was WIDE and BIG now. Even his hands were big and meaty! <br />
<br />
Not fair, stupid jocks, he thought, hearing the bell and shuffled his way to gym class. He had a feeling his bad day was going to get worse. <br />
<br />
And he was right.</p>
