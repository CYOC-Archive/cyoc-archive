<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd couldn’t help but enjoy himself as he looked the shy awkward girl laying down on his couch. Althu Th Liz was turning several shades of red she appeared slightly more at ease than when they first entered the dorm room. Todd still found himself drumming on Liz’s bare leg as she giggled slightly, still fidgeting from time to time.<br />
<br />
“You know that really tickles,” she giggled, shifting slightly on the couch. “And it looks kinda weird only wearing one sock.”<br />
<br />
Todd grinned as he now gazed at Liz. “Well don’t want you to feel weird,” he grinned as he moved his hand up to the top of Liz’s other knee sock. Liz’s eyes bulged as she watched Todd’s movements. “Um,um, um.....Uh Wait,” She stammered. Todd paused looking up at the girl. “You want we to stop,” he asked, not wanting to push his luck.<br />
<br />
Liz sighed as she shyly looked at him. “Ummm, no...I mean,uh if you could just give it a sec,” She stammered. “Uh...I..I...don’t mind really, but could you kinda just take it off slowly like the other. I’m...uh...” Todd smiled as the girl trailed off. Liz looked up shyly trying to force a smile, only adding to her awkwardness.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay Liz,” he soothed. “Here if you want you can do it Okay?”<br />
<br />
Liz paused looking at Todd curiously. Sighing she reached down removing the sock in one felt swoop. Cautiously she now extended her legs, letting her feet rest on Todd’s lap. “I’m...I’m sorry,” she muttered. “I...Uh..this is dumb, but I’m feeling a bit modest about all this. We just met and here I am taking my clothes off...and stuff.”<br />
<br />
Todd laughed as he looked at the girl. “It’s just your socks Liz,” he said casually holding her feet in his hands. “Listen I’ll tell you what just sit back and relax I won’t touch your legs anymore.<br />
<br />
“No...no,” She stammered. “It’s um okay, I Uh, kinda like it....it feels nice.”<br />
<br />
Todd smiled as he gently touched Liz’s legs. “Well that’s good,” he grinned. “You really do have nice legs.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” she said shyly, settling back into the couch.<br />
<br />
Todd grinned as the two began quietly watching t.v. again. An idea was forming again but he needed Liz to be comfortable in order for it to work. “Say Liz,” he said. “Are you starting to get a little hungry you want a snack?”<br />
<br />
“Yea a little,” she murmured shrugging. Todd grinned. “Cool if you want why don’t you go help yourself to a snack, I have a bunch of stuff over by the microwave. You can help yourself to whatever you want.”<br />
<br />
Nodding shyly Todd watched as Liz got off the couch and made her way over to the small pantry area in the room.  The sweete contained a full sized fridge with a small pantry and microwave. Todd usually stocked it with snacks and other food he could make quickly. Their was even a small center island that served as a kitchen table/ cabinet. Todd watched as the girl made her way into the pantry area in search of a snack.<br />
<br />
Todd now looked at the device and brought up the height option in the menu. Liz stood at 5’6”, about average height for a woman. Smiling he decided to have a bit of fun. Adjusting her height to 5’10” he activated the device with a delayed reaction. Todd also activated an awareness option to the height increase, making sure that if Liz did notice her height difference it would not alarm her in anyway.<br />
<br />
Todd now watched as Liz slowly began to grow. At first the girl was having some difficulty reaching some of the higher shelves having to stand on tiptoe. As her height increased though she found the task of reaching them becoming easier. After some searching she finally discovered something that interested her. “ooo popcorn,” she said happily grabbing the box and removing a bag. Todd smiled as Liz happily placed the bag in the microwave and hit the button. As she now watched the microwave an odd look crossed her face. “Everything okay Liz,” Todd asked.<br />
<br />
Liz frowned slightly as she looked herself over. Taking stock of her herself she checked out her clothes finding them to still fit properly (Todd had adjusted her clothing to change with her size), still something seemed different. “I’m Uh I think I’m having a tall day,” she replied sheepishly. Todd tilted his head grinning. “A tall day,” he asked. “What do you mean.”<br />
<br />
“I Uh never noticed how high your shelves were,” she shrugged. “I didn’t think I could reach them, but it was um, super easy. Guess I never thought about me being tall.”<br />
<br />
Todd nodded in response as internally he couldn’t help but marvel at his invention. Liz seemed to be adjusting to her new height and with her awareness settings she simply shrugged it off even though something was a miss. Smiling now he looked at the device. “I wonder if someone can have a short day,” he thought as he adjusted the settings and hit the device.<br />
<br />
Todd now watched gleefully as Liz began to shrink. Happily she was standing behind the center island so Todd could easily see the girl begin to shrink. Liz returned to her original height as she waited for the popcorn, this was brief though as Todd continued to watch the girl get smaller. <br />
<br />
Liz was now maybe 5’2” and still getting smaller. Todd had watched as her body slowly seemed to disappear behind the center island as she watched the popcorn. By the time she became 5’ tall Todd could see a puzzled look cross her face.<br />
<br />
“Everything okay Liz,” he asked. Liz turned smiling shyly. “Yeah,” she said shyly. “I Uh just feel a bit off is all. Can’t put my finger on it though.” Todd grinned as he looked at Liz. The girl was now below the five foot mark. The center island, which had originally been waist high now came up to her chest as appeared to still be rising. As the popcorn finished Liz was now a full foot shorter standing only 4’6”.<br />
<br />
Todd smiled as the girl now attempted to grab the popcorn out of the microwave. Unfortunately for Liz it appeared to be slightly out of reach. Confused the girl stared at the bag as she continued to shrink. Shrugging Liz grabbed a nearby chair, useing it to stand on in order to retrieve the bag. Todd watched in awe as the girl continued to shrink, only her neck and head were visible now from her place behind the center island. Todd watched as her head began to slow descent behind it though. Now barley 4’ tall he watched as the tiny girl lifted the bag over her head in order to pour it into the bowl.her task completed she now walked the chair back to its original spot, letting Todd have a clear view of her diminished form.<br />
<br />
As Liz returned to the center island he noticed that the top of the center island was now even Liz’s eyes. This changed rather quickly as Liz shrank again, her eyes disappearing behind the center island. “Doing okay Liz,” he called, marveling at the shrinking process.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I’m okay,” she responded in a voice several octaves higher than what Todd had expected. “Did you want um, salt or butter.”<br />
<br />
“No that’s okay,” he said smiling. “It comes prebuttered, why don’t you just come back to the couch.”<br />
<br />
Liz responded in a voice that made her sound like she had inhaled a tank of helium. Todd watched as two tiny hands reached up to grab the bowl. Grasping the bowl awkwardly he could see it disappear behind the island. He now marveled as the 3 foot tall Liz began the journey back to the couch. <br />
<br />
Todd marveled as the girl continued to grow smaller. By the time she reached the couch she was perhaps only two and a half feet tall. Shyly she handed the bowl of popcorn to Todd as she looked at the couch. Slightly confused she gazed at it, not quite understanding what was happening. Shrugging she now began to climb up before sitting down on the edge. The girl now looked down at her bare feet noticing they did not touch the ground anymore.<br />
<br />
“You okay Liz,” he asked, hiding a grin. Liz nodded awkwardly as she continued to look at her feet. “Yeah um I’m okay,” she muttered. “Short girl problems.”<br />
<br />
Todd giggled as the two foot tall girl now settled back onto the couch trying to stretch her legs out to place them back on Todd’s lap. Satisfied with his size experiment Todd deactivated the device with the changes occurring instantly. Liz now blinked as she noticed her feet now resting on Todd’s lap. Shrugging she reached into the bowl of popcorn, happily munching away. Todd just smiled down at the girl wondering what he should do next.</p>
