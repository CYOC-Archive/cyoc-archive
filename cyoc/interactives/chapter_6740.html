<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hi, good morning. My name is Paul, and I was wondering if you would be interested in buying a box or two of...&quot; the young man began to ask when he suddenly noticed all that the person he was talking to had on was a pair of red speedos--a pair of tightly-packed speedos, if he might add--but he quickly regained his composure and continued his spiel. &quot;Of... of chocolates for our troop fundraising.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben grinned widely as he checked out Paul from head to toe. The boy scout was on the tallish and thinnish side but carried his khaki uniform well borne of the confidence built from what looked like many years with the troop. Aside from the red cap and scarf, Paul wore a pair of big glasses that heightened his already nerdy appearance, but then Ben noticed a familiar red oval patch stitched to Paul's shirt and thought, oh, an Eagle Scout no less! This was going to be fun. &quot;Sure, Paul. Come on in. I'm Ben, by the way,&quot; Ben replied offering a handshake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Ben,&quot; said Paul taking Ben's hand into his own and giving it a firm shake. For a brief second, Paul felt a spark of electricity pass through his arm and into the rest of his body. He instinctively wanted to pull away but had to wait for Ben to let go of his hand first. He didn't want to come across as rude; that's not what he was taught to do. Paul grimaced as much as a polite smile as he could until Ben released his tight grip. Whoa, what was that, he thought.<br />
<br />
Paul stepped inside the living room as Ben closed the door behind them. Ben looked around and didn't see any of the guys. Andrew and Jake must have taken off, he thought. &quot;So, what's this for again?&quot; Ben asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A fundraising project for our troop, sir,&quot; replied Paul. He tried his best to keep staring at Ben's pumped up physique. Again, not only was it impolite, it wasn't something he normally did. He wondered why the hell was this guy only wearing a speedo in the middle of the morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool. Let me get my wallet, Paul. They're in my pants. Why don't you sit down on the couch for a while? You look like you could use a break.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; beamed Paul. &quot;I've been walking all morning, and I still got a few more boxes to go through.&quot; He felt relieved at the notion that Ben might not be such a strange guy after all.<br />
<br />
Ben was thinking how long it would take before Paul succumbed to the change without any further contact from him or any of the other &quot;speedo fags.&quot; As much as he wanted to rush Paul right there and then, he decided to wait and see what would happen. After all, he wasn't in a rush. He's got him where he wanted him.<br />
<br />
Ben went to his room and got out his wallet. As he about to return to the living room, David, his cop brother, appeared in the hallway and came up to him. &quot;What the fuck are you doing man? Dad and I have been watching the whole thing. Why haven't you kissed him yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben hushed him. &quot;Ssssh... quiet. He might hear you. He's already freaked out as it is. I don't want him bolting for the door. I wanna see what happens if we took things slow. Besides, I've already made contact. There's no way he's going to want out now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, dude. You're killing us. That kid is so fuckin' hot, and he doesn't even realize it. C'mon, I don't know what stopping you from jumping his bones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Willpower, David, and lots of it,&quot; grinned Ben. &quot;Now, go look for Andrew, Jake and Jason. They may want to see this.&quot;<br />
<br />
David flashed a knowing smile and disappeared. Ben reentered the living and saw Paul looking a bit uncomfortable on the couch. The young man was fidgeting and tapping his foot repeatedly on the carpet. He looked like he was sweating a bit too. Ben also noticed certain differences in Paul's physique. He seemed thicker somewhat, and his uniform looked a wee bit tighter. God, I wonder what's going through his head right now, Ben thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Paul didn't know what was happening to him. At first he felt fine, but as soon as Ben left the room, he immediately felt hot and dizzy, and he sat down on the couch. Am I coming down with something, he wondered. I hope not, I have a big weekend planned. Paul continually wiped his forehead with his hankerchief, and tried to focus on his upcoming Scout event, but all he could think about was Ben and his red pair of speedos. Paul thought, he certainly filled it out well... what the... why am I thinking of that guy? Get a grip on yourself, man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope I didn't keep you waiting for long,&quot; Ben said.<br />
<br />
Paul suddenly looked up and was surprised to see Ben standing right beside him. He didn't even hear him coming. &quot;N-no p-problem, sir,&quot; he replied, as he stood up from the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgot to ask how much each box was,&quot; Ben said, eyeing the slight bulge that was growing in Paul's shorts. He doesn't look like he's noticed it yet, Ben smiled to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-ten dollars.&quot; Paul was beginning to get worried. He could hardly take his eyes off Ben's, but he managed to look away before it became too suspicous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whooo... pretty steep.&quot; Ben opened his wallet and pretended to finger through the bills while all the while studying how Paul's body was gradually morphing for the better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, it's for a good cause.&quot; Paul's clothes were really filling out now, but he remained clueless to everything that was happening to him. The size of his arms and legs were fast approaching what his sleeves and pants could accommodate, and his chest was pushing his uniform outwards. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really? So what do we get out of it?&quot; Ben could hardly contain his excitement as he watched Paul's face becoming older and more handsome. For the first time, Ben saw how blue Paul's eyes were now that the growing boy's glasses had gone away. And fuck, those gorgeous lips had become all the more kissable thanks much in part to the disappearance of Paul's braces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I'm not sure what you mean.&quot; Paul's entire 17-year-old body continued to mature into adulthood unbeknownst to him. By this time, he gained more muscle in a few minutes than he could have gotten over a few years of weight training. He absent-mindedly adjusted his tightening shirt and shorts to relieve some of the tension that was building up. He assumed he was just getting nervous with Ben's questioning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe... I'm just kidding, Paul. Put me down for five, one for each of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. Thanks, sir.&quot; All of Paul's apprehensions melted away. He had made the sale, and now he could finally leave. He hadn't been this nervous ever since his first year as a boy scout. And besides, why should a handsome, built, buffed and speedo-wearing man make him nervous? He certainly wasn't gay... or was he?<br />
<br />
Ben looked over Paul's shoulder and saw the gang was all there, ready and waiting. Ben smiled and nodded, giving his brother David the signal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Ben, who's your friend?&quot; David called out loudly enough to get Paul's attention.<br />
<br />
Paul turned around and was startled by the sight of seeing four more men with to-do-for bodies and all wearing red speedos that were holding some of the biggest and hardest cocks he'd ever seen. (Sure, he'd seen a few big ones during camp, but none reached the size of the ones he was now surrounded with.) Each one of them was a magnificent specimen of masculine beauty and strength. Each moved with the sleekness of predatory grace, and Paul felt that he was their next meal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Paul. Let me introduce you to my brother, David, and standing over there are my buds Andrew and Jason. The guy over there is Jake. He's someone I just met this morning, would you believe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, are you guys part of the swimming team?&quot; Paul asked.<br />
<br />
Everyone laughed a little. &quot;Who? Us? Naaah..&quot; answered David. &quot;But there is a team that we're a part of. A team that we'd like for you to join. Isn't that right, Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right, David.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul couldn't figure out who among the four guys spoke out until he zeroed in a fifth person who come in from behind them. Paul's eyes widened in disbelief when he realized it was another young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;*That's* your father?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yup,&quot; Ben said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Michael, Paul, isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, but that's impossible.&quot; Paul couldn't believe what he was seeing. The guy looked barely over 18, and Ben and David were calling him &quot;Dad.&quot; Something was seriously wrong, and he suddenly had the urge to flee, but something was holding him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's gotten pretty big since he first showed up, hasn't he?&quot; Jason asked Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, he sure has,&quot; Jake replied. &quot;He's just about ready to pop out of those clothes. And look at that package. I wouldn't mind making a delivery like that every week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you talking about?&quot; shouted Paul until he looked down and saw for himself what they were talking about. His body, if that was his body, had been changed dramatically. His spindly limbs were packed with so much meat they were threatening to rip his sleeves and pants to pieces. And his shirt, what on earth could be causing it to flare out so much. All he could mutter was, &quot;Holy fucking shit...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Such language--and from an Eagle Scout too!&quot; joked Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's old enough to swear,&quot; said Michael. &quot;He's what? 21, 22?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, looks like 22. How do you feel, Paul?&quot; asked Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;G-good...&quot; blurted Paul, but he quickly recanted. &quot;No, this is wrong! This shouldn't be happening.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't fight it Paul,&quot; Jake said. &quot;You know I tried to at first, but look at me now. I don't think I've ever been been happier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon Ben. Time to finish what you've started,&quot; David declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finish what? I'm getting the hell out of here!&quot; Paul reached from his bag of chocolates, but as he bent down, his uniform tore in numerous places, and most embarrassingly of all, at the seat of his pants. When he turned to look behind him, more pieces of his Boy Scout ensemble ripped and fell off revealing a very tight (practically body-hugging) black T-shirt, only his belt kept the rest of his shorts intact, and for the first time, Paul saw the distinctive color of red speedos peeking through the tears of his pants. &quot;Oh my God, no...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, that's so fucking hot,&quot; commented Jason, rubbing his hard-on through his swimsuit as were the the guys who were watching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whu-What's happening to me?&quot; Paul was very afraid but at the same time very excited. His heart was beating so fast, and it was only then he realized that he also had a hard-on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing you won't ever regret,&quot; said Ben, approaching him and placing his lips over Paul's. <br />
<br />
At first, Paul thought he'd put up more of a fight; instead, he found that he was kissing back Ben with as much fervor and passion that his one-time customer was giving him. The closest Paul, who was still a virgin by the way, had ever gotten to a sexual encounter was a strictly-kissing makeout session with the camp counselor from the girl's side of the lake. But now he decided that women had no longer had any place in his life. All his previous sensibilities were washed away in a wave of hunger and lust for Ben and his red speedos.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got to get me some of that,&quot; moaned David as he joined his brother in kissing the former-boy scout. Jason and Jake joined the fray by going for Paul's shirt and what was left of his pants and tearing them off his body. What remained standing in the middle of room being worshipped by four other speedo-clad men was a red-bannered demigod whose cock was so big that its head peered over the waistband. <br />
<br />
Michael and Andrew helped Paul out of his socks and shoes, and the six of them initiated their newest member by heading towards the bedroom and continuing their lovefest there. As David was kissing Paul on the mouth, Jason and Jake each had a nipple in their respective mouths. Michael and Andrew were literally at Paul's feet and licking every nook and cranny of his toes. And finally, right on Paul's crotch was Ben sucking his cock through the red speedos that could hardly hang on to its contents. Paul gave himself completely to the men who had opened a whole new world to him, and his tanned, ripped body experienced unexplored heights of pleasure. He was one of them now. He was a speedo fag.<br />
<br />
Within minutes, Paul couldn't hold back any longer and spewed his creamy cum right into his swimwear and surprisingly, so did everyone else. As his tool throbbed and trembled, and his cum was absorbed into his speedos, he cussed and moaned like there was no tomorrow, but he knew he still had that big troop weekend coming up. He wondered how many of his fellow Eagle Scout buddies he could introduce to his new lifestyle, and then he remembered: fuck yeah, those guys always said they wanted to go swimming in the lake this year. <br />
<br />
Fuck yeah.</p>
