<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Sean Hayes -- really, Robbie the Crusher -- was intimidating someone, he'd describe terrible and awful things that he would do to them, usually variants on how he would crush their skull.  Putting a kitten's head in a garlic press was a favorite metaphor, though Bob had only actually had to do this once in reality, but he still had a vivid memory of the bloody oozing horror.  He also remembered the old lady's expression when he did that, and while Paladin had wished himself all sorts of powers, a good poker face was not among them.  Robbie the Crusher knew the kid was reading his mind, his eyes staring wide with horror, his face pale as he spoke with false bravado, &quot;Ah, nice to meet you....&quot;<br />
<br />
Superhero or not, a kid was a kid, and Robbie was a specialist in intimidation, so just imagined a couple hundred kittens in garlic presses, decomposed bodies, severed heads, and just to be showy, a pole-dancing hooker doing self-flagelation with a straight-razor.  Kent paled in horror, mewling helplessly, &quot;Take it away!  Take it away!&quot; as he wished that someone, anyone, could take away his power to read minds and the awful memories that came with it.<br />
<br />
The nearest person was Robbie the Crusher, and since taking away such powers from an unprepared innocent such as Kent was a noble cause, at least as Kent thought of it (not that he was thinking straight at the moment), the power flowed out, along with the awful memories of what he'd witnessed ever since he looked into the mob enforcer's mind, or even conceived of the supremely bad idea that mind-reading would be a good power to have.<br />
<br />
And Robbie the Crusher knew all this.  &quot;Sean Hayes,&quot; he repeated, smiling at Kent as he squeezed his hand.  &quot;My, you're a big fellow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; said Kent.  &quot;Uh, yeah.  I had a growth spurt a while ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robbie the Crusher grinned.  &quot;Don't say.  Don't say.  Sit down, son.&quot;  He gestured to a chair, and while so doing, glanced towards the window and saw two little birds sitting on the ledge outside, as well as the incredibly complex thought of the two little birds, who he realized after a moment were little bird Ty and little bird Peter, who were both suspicious of him, and incredibly protective of their little brother, Kent.<br />
<br />
The suspicions were a bad thought, and Robbie tugged on them, reeling them into his own mind until all that was left in the two little boy birds on the windowsill were happy cheery thoughts about how happy they were for Kent, how much fun he would have playing college ball, and how amusing it would be to give the college scout a dick down to his knees.<br />
<br />
Damn, these kids were twisted, Robbie thought as his dick stretched down inside his pants.  But he knew a thing or two about poker faces, and the mindreading ability was making that a lot easier.  He made certain to look disconcerted as he took a seat behind the desk -- not hard -- and began to speak cheerily and boringly about college application forms and scholarships and whatnot until Kent was bored silly and was beggining to wish he'd get on with it and Robbie the Crusher asked, &quot;So, would you like me to take care of everything for you?&quot; and Kent wished desperately that he would.<br />
<br />
So he did.  The first thing that Robbie gained was the ability to take care of anything for Kent, so Robbie the Crusher wished for all of Kent's powers, along with Ty and Peter's too.<br />
<br />
There was a huge rush of power flooding into him, Robbie leaping up over a foot in height and gaining hundreds of pounds of muscle, then rapidly transforming twice into two different pigeons before going back to his new giant wrestler form.  Then he sucked the bad memories of losing all their powers from the now 5'4&quot; scrawny Kent and the two dazed boys sitting on their butts on the ground outside the window.<br />
<br />
Then Robbie the Crusher had a dilemma.  He was in the mob, and he knew that teenage boys didn't get huge amounts of magical powers on accident, anymore than they were likely to get a million dollars and a case of uzis.  Snuffing these three kids would be easy.  Getting away with it?  That would be hard, because even in reading deeply into their minds, even Ty didn't know where he got his powers.  Robbie the Crusher suspected a fairy godmother, and if a godmother were anything like a godfather, then this would mean serious trouble.<br />
<br />
So he'd need to give a few things back.  First, he thought of giving Kent back his height, along with the weird power of never being any less that 6'8&quot;  He tossed in some of the muscle too, along with the extra foot of cock Ty had given him.  He then thought about it a bit more, and realized that the world was going to expect for Paladin to be around for a while, and it's not as if the mob had too many problems with a super-powered do-gooder flying around and putting out forest fires and stuff.  But the business of having any power he could think of was just getting out of hand, so Robbie gave him the power to grow to triple his height--which at 6'8&quot; came to nice even 20' tall--and also fly around, be super strong, and also that silly business of talking to animals and singing to make plants grow.  That should be enough for any super hero.<br />
<br />
Ty?  Robbie thought about turning him into a chick, then watched as Ty morphed into a busty cheerleader, Tyrena.  Sweet!  Sucking the bad memories of transforming out of her head was weird, but then Robbie thought a bit more and swapped some of the power back, giving Tyrena the power to change guys bodies, and Peter the power to change girl's bodies.  Maybe that would be enough?<br />
<br />
Robbie, as a mob enforcer, had done many terrible things, and witnessed many, many far more terrible things.  And even with the almost limitless power at his control, he began to grow very scared, picturing all the thousand awful things that would happen if a really PISSED fairy godmother got hold of him.<br />
<br />
What he really wished, being here in a high school again, is that he'd feel as safe as he had when he was younger and more innocent, the age of these stupid kids, and he hadn't been Robbie the Crusher, just plain old Robbie Corleone, Robbie C.  And as he wished that, the age and memories began to roll away, as he grew younger and younger, until finally he stood there, Robbie C., a kind of big and thuggish looking fourteen year old.  &quot;Uh, hi...&quot; Robbie said.  &quot;Uh, this isn't the chess club, is it?  I'm new.  I just transfered in...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kent blinked as well.  &quot;Uh, I don't think so.  I was supposed to go in here to talk to someone about a basketball scholarship.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robbie glanced around.  &quot;Doesn't look like he's here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kent did as well, then looked out the window and waved.  &quot;Hi Peter!  Hi Tyrena!&quot;</p>
