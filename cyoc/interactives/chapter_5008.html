<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim stepped through the rippling portal into a lush, green meadow, with rolling hills in the distance.  The grass was thick, and felt nice under his pawed feet.  He was half expencting a ride similar to one on a waterslide, or even perhaps a giant flash of bright light as he stepped through the portal.  Any kind of transition ... but he got nothing.  It was as though he was just walked through a doorway into another room.  'Seems kind of strange' he thinks to himself, expecting at least some kind of ... well, anything.  That was kind of a letdown, considering how the portal to get here was formed.  He had braced himself for nothing.<br />
<br />
Tim looks around the area, noting to himself lush greenery at his feet, and a snow capped mountain range in the far off, fog-filled distance.  He immediately knew where he was.  The location from his dream.  He turned off to his left to see ... yes, there's that lone, shady willow tree.  It's not quite as big as he remembered it to be.  Then again, he was nearly thrice his height, and hung like ... well, a dragon.  Timothy strode off towards the tree, finding that walking with a tail for balance meant he'd never trip and fall and injure himself, like he always used to.<br />
<br />
He began to think to himself about all the times his ex, Saul had helped him bandage wounds, and help make him feel better.  Even if they were minor injuries he could have fixed by himself, Saul was there to help.  He did like Saul, and he had wondered as he walked towards the tree, if he'd ever see him again.<br />
<br />
As he got closer to the tree, it seemed to be getting smaller, or was it?  Maybe it was just his imagination.  He was pre-occupied, afterall, hard to concentrate on two things at once with his one track mind.  <br />
<br />
He got closer, and closer still, and indeed, the tree wasn't getting any larger.  Tim idly wondered to himself if he had grown more, or if the tree was shrinking?  He hadn't any idea of what was going on anyway.  One thing was certain, the tree is his only guiding point, so he knew he should walk towards it, if at least to get his bearings.<br />
<br />
He was mere steps from it when it became noticable that the tree that towered over him in his dream, barely came up to his knee.  Tim grinned to himself, for once in his life, he was big, and powerfull.  He didn't have to be a boytoyish little waif of a man any longer ... and he enjoyed it.  He didn't mind his previous size, but he had always wondered what it would be like to be big, and strong, and dominant ... a smile danced across his lips, and he couldn't help himself.  He began to feel that all too familiar feeling in his sheath.  His arousal was demanding attention, and who was he to argue?  Even if he did, he figured he couldn't argue with his sheath, there's no one in there to argue back ... yet.<br />
<br />
That thought alone made him grin even wider, and his erection poke out from his sheath, and he hadn't even touched it yet.  'Now is a good a time as any' he thought to himself as he surveyed the area ... *his* area.  His erection pulsed from that thought.  &quot;Yeah, I could get used to this, indeed.&quot;  He said, to absolutely no one.  His size, the power he posessed, and his thoughts all combined into one thing; the need to release his pent up sexual energy.<br />
<br />
Timothy stroked along his length with his massive paw, murrumbling at the pleasure he took from it.  He felt a minor itch on his thigh, and went to rub at it, when he realised that it went away.  No big deal, he could concentrate on more important matters now.  He stroked along his length again, the feeling was electric, and highly erotic.  Then he got that stupid little itch again.  He went to scratch it, but it once again left.<br />
<br />
After being interupted twice, Tim looked to investigate.  He saw nothing on his thigh.  He looked at the immdiate area, and didn't see anything.  He looked carefully around.  Something had to be bothering him, things happen for a reason, afterall.  It was then that Tim realised he wasn't alone.  There was a figure frantically trying to get his attention below ... way down below, even pelting him with rocks.  Well, pebbles anyway.  Timothy took a very carefull step back, and sat down.  He leaned over slowly, so as not to frighten whatever it was, and take a better look at it.<br />
<br />
To his suprise, it was Saul.  His ex, and the one that had him preoccupied.  But he was so ... small.  Tim estimated Saul to be about ankle height in comparrison, which made Tim's erection harder, and throb insistently.  Tim then realised he was a giant in this realm, and he very much liked that idea, as he always wanted to play out a fantasy like this, and with Saul, to boot.  Tim could hardly keep his erection a secret at his height, not that he really wanted to anyway.  It was something of a turn on for him to have his ex see him so big, so powerfull ... and so obviously aroused with a tree sized length bigger than the tree Saul was using for shade.<br />
<br />
That thought alone produced a small gush of pre.  Small to Tim, but big enough that Saul was drenched in it.  Tim didn't know whether to laugh, or help Saul out as he flailed around in Tim's puddle of essence.  Tim figured it was best to let Saul help himself on this one.  Best not to make Saul feel worse.  The poor guy had a foot on him just yesterday, now Tim could do just that ... literally.<br />
<br />
Tim whispered to Saul, once he was free &quot;Saul, is that you?&quot; knowing his true voice would give him a headache.  Saul immediately nodded, and shouted, what sounded like at the top of his lungs &quot;Tim ... How did you get so big?&quot;  Timothy grinned and shrugged.  His one and only chance to act mature, at a serious question, and he was throwing that opportunity right out the window.  He merely gestured to his rampant length with a grin &quot;I thought you liked big, Saul?&quot;  he added a smirk, and then a friendly grin.  <br />
<br />
Saul rolled his eyes, something Timothy did not catch.  &quot;Okay *big* guy, what do we do, and where are we?&quot;  Saul seemed to emphasize big with a sarcastic tone of voice.  Timothy heard his question, but still wanted to have fun with his size, and current state of arousal.  Besides, he had to let Saul know that the dragon was in charge now.  Timothy's grin never dissapeared, it only got wider.  &quot;We don't do anything.&quot; He placed a paw to his chest &quot;I am going to enjoy myself, and you can watch, *little* one.&quot;  Tim said, in his best attempt at a dominant fashion, emphasising little, and even glaring at Saul as he did.<br />
<br />
Saul took a cautious step backwards, and bumped into the tree.  Little did Timothy know, or Saul for that matter; that Saul had become a wizard, a very powefull one at that; in this strange, new land.  Saul instincitively put his hands up to block, as Tim brought a paw toward him, and placed it onto the ground, palm up.  &quot;Don't worry Saul, your in good hands.&quot;   Both Tim and Saul couldn't help but make a face at that badly timed, and unintentional pun.  Saul climed carefully into Tim's hand.<br />
<br />
Tim slowly brought his paw up to his midsection, and cupped both of them together, giving Saul about a 45 foot area to sit on, and he did just that.  Tim carefully sat next to the tree, leaning against it a little.  Hearing it creak and moan under his weight aroused him even more.  His length splashed pre into his hands, saturating poor Saul once again.  Tim frowned a bit, despite himself &quot;That's twice now, and both times I never meant it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Saul shook himself off, and smiled half heartedly, that last blast actuallt hurt &quot;Hey, I always liked cum shots anyway, right?&quot;  Timothy and Saul began to talk, as Tim's seemingly insatiable erection began to retreat into his sheath, which took a suprising ammount of time.  Tim is a big dragon, afterall.  Tim explained to Saul the box, the mysterious flash of light, and then his transformation, his spooky, and now real dream, and now, the lack of box, to be able to fix this mess.  Saul just nodded, and absorbed the info given to him, as Tim knew he would.<br />
<br />
Saul, after a long, and annoyingly silent pause, piped up &quot;I can fix this!&quot;  He stated, seeming quite sure of himself.  &quot;I can fix anything, remember?&quot; he said, with a smile.  Tim smiled half heartedly, for two reasons.  He liked his new size and being dominant, and being as hung as he was seemed to be icing on this cake.  Beefcake that is.  Tim had the body he always wanted, and so much more.  He also figured this was one thing Saul could never fix, even if he tried.  <br />
<br />
Saul jokingly said &quot;Look Tim, you got to be a giant, I should get something out of this deal too.  You know how I hate raw deals.&quot;  Tim nodded, and replied &quot;Saul, your still the same, your only change is your change of clothes, and how wet you are from my pre.&quot;  He stated with a little chuckle.<br />
<br />
Saul just laughed, and shook his finger at Tim, in the clasic 'shame shame' motion.  &quot;For all you know, I may be ... uhh&quot; he paused to think &quot;... a magician!&quot; He stated again, seeming quite sure of himself.  Timothy just burst out laughing.  A laugh that echoed off the mountains in the distance, making it sound even deeper than it really was.  After catching his breath, Tim said, still chuckling to himself &quot;So .. what are you going to do, pull a rabbit out of your hat?&quot;  He said, motioning to Saul's baseball cap.<br />
<br />
Saul smirked, and took his hat off &quot;Okay smart guy, here's rabbits!&quot; He waved his fingers over his hat, and then put his hand into his hat, and pulled out ... nothing.  &quot;Okay, so I'm no magician.&quot;  Saul said, feeling kind of dejected.  He was sure he had gotten something out of this, and besides, he wanted to try his hand in magic anyway.  Not parlour tricks, but real, honest to goodness magic.  The kind of thing that makes street performers go slack jawed.  <br />
<br />
Unknown to Saul, or Tim, a rabbit was indeed conjured from the hat, just not how he intended.  There was a rabbit, standing not two feet to Tim's side, and another, and another, and another and another... There were dozens in the area, all grouped around Timothy's massive frame seemingly transfixed on Saul and Tim.  At this point, Tim was rolling with laughter.  Not being able to help it, he knew Saul was feeling blue because of it, the way Saul presented it was quite funny.  Tim pounded the ground with a fist, trying to catch his breath.<br />
<br />
All around, a great &quot;THOOM!&quot; was heard, and Tim caught his breath alright, only to have it stolen away.  He must have crushed a good 25 little white rabbits under his gigantic, balled up fist.  He could see a huge red stain on the ground, surrounding his paw, and he cringed.  Saul just shuddered, unsure as to what just happened.  He asked for rabbits ... and he got them alright, in groves.  Does this mean he's a magician afterall?<br />
<br />
Saul tried talking, but he was speechless.  After a few minutes of awkward silence, Saul produced an &quot;Oh shit, Tim!&quot;  Not exactly the smartest thing to say at the time, but that's what came out.  Saul put his hat on, then took it off and then wigled his fingers above his hat.  &quot;Rabbits, go back to where you came from!&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, not a bunny was left, they had all vanished.  Saul seemed pleased with his work.  He looked to Tim's still balled up fist, and noticed no blood stains.  Tim noticed this too, and breathed a sigh of relief.  &quot;Good, it's not permanent.&quot; Tim noted.  Saul nodded and plunked himself down in Timothy's paw.  Thanking himself that he was in the one not balled up tightly like that.<br />
<br />
Tim looked at Saul, and Saul looked at Tim.  Almost at the same time, they said &quot;Okay, so what now?&quot;  they both chuckled a bit, noting each other's powers to themselves.  Timothy could crush, break, or force people to do whatever he wanted, and Saul could do the same magically, or so it seemed.  Saul seemed in deep thought, more than likely wondering what he was capable of.  Tim let Saul out of his hand, and back onto the ground gently.  He too was curious as to what Saul could do.<br />
<br />
Both Saul and Timothy looked a bit worried.  What exactly was Saul really capable of?  And what was Timothy really capable of?</p>
