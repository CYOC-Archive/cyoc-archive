<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad and his mom were talking while they walked through a park near their home. June was telling him several stories about the magic kingdom of Tir Na Nog, its people and places. Chad was getting more and more eager at the idea of visiting it, but his mother told him he needed to learn a little bit more about his magic powers before he could be there.<br />
<br />
&quot;All fairies have nature powers. We can control wind, water, fire and plants at will.&quot; June said as she moved the wind around her, water from a small pond and a tree&#39;s branches. Chad was fascinated and he can&#39;t wait to do that thing by himself. &quot;Also, each fairy has a unique power or ability. In my case I can create illusions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad was open mouthed when he saw his mother had cloned herself a thousand times, then she became huge and finally she vanished in a pink cloud. It seemed so real that he can&#39;t believe it was all an illusion. &quot;See?&quot; She said as she put a hand on her son&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Someday you&#39;ll master your magic powers like me.&quot; She took a seat on a near park bench. &quot;However, it&#39;s still pretty exhausting. Magic is not endless, so be careful on how do you use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I try? Teach me, please!!&quot; Chad said with his eyes looking directly at his mother&#39;s. &quot;Of course, honey. Let&#39;s star with something simple. Focus on this water bottle and try to move the water inside it.&quot; Chad did what his mother told him, at first nothing happened but after a few seconds, June could see that small waves were appearing on the surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a good begining. Don&#39;t expect to do something impres...&quot; June was mid sentence when the water bottle suddenly exploded but she didn&#39;t get wet. In fact, the water was now suspended in middle air. &quot;Impressive... Wow!! You nailed it! Let&#39;s see what else you can do!&quot;<br />
<br />
After playing with the water for a while, Chad started to move the air around them, changing its color like Pocahontas and then mixing both elements to create a beautiful scene in mid air. Finally the water fell on them like tiny colorful drops that didn&#39;t wet them. A small rainbow appeared and his mother told him that sometimes watching rainbows can restore his magic energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a very good magic user, honey. I&#39;m very proud of you!&quot; June said as she stood up. &quot;Now, let&#39;s go back to the house. I need to give you something very special.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But mom, I still don&#39;t know what is my unique power.&quot; Chad protested a little but his mother just kept the smile on her face. &quot;You will know, eventually. Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
While they walked back to their home, Chad kept using his magic powers to move the air around him, any water source he could see and several plants. He even could make a flame on a candle to dance. His mother noticed but she didn&#39;t say a word, she just smiled.<br />
<br />
When they arrived, Chad was very excited about what he will get. He imagined a lot of things, a treasure, a magic weapon, or a magic pet, he had no idea but he can&#39;t contain his excitement. However, what June gave him was far more simple and unexpected.<br />
<br />
&quot;A ring?&quot; He said as he watched his mother putting a ring on his left hand. &quot;It&#39;s not a regular ring. It&#39;s a very important one. Can you see the little jewels on it. Chad looked closely and noticed five diamond-like stones embedded around the ring. &quot;These jewels react to your magic energy. When you&#39;re full of power, all of them will be color blue and as you run out of magic they turn white one by one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad blushed a little when he noticed all the jewels were white. It seems he had used all his magic power for now. &quot;You were really busy in your way home.&quot; June said while she giggled a little. &quot;It&#39;s ok, you&#39;ll be fully charged after s good sleep. Now, prepare for bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad obeyed, so he took a quick shower and then he changed into his pajamas, he didn&#39;t take off his finger the whole time and he was constantly looking at it, but it&#39;s jewels were changing color very slowly. &quot;Mom, do you have a ring too?&quot; Chad asked while he took dinner with June. &quot;Mine is not a ring. Look.&quot; She pointed at her ears. &quot;The spots in my earrings work like the jewels in your ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
They kept talking for a while and then they watch some TV together. A show about two teenage superheroes wearing magic artifacts just like them. Chad was smiling at the idea of becoming a superhero too, but his mother had already told him he should kept his magic powers a secret as long as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, will you help me to train my powers tomorrow?&quot; Chad asked her after he brushed his teeth. &quot;Of course, honey. I will show a few practical tricks that could help you in your daily life.&quot; June replied as she watching him going to his bedroom. &quot;And do you think I will learn to use my unique power?&quot; She didn&#39;t answer immediately, she just smiled before she left. &quot;Maybe. You want to know what it is, don&#39;t you?&quot; Chad happily nodded before he jumped on his bed.<br />
<br />
That night, Chad couldn&#39;t sleep. He was thinking about how much his life has changed in a day and all the things that are coming. He knew he won&#39;t be able to sleep until he finds out what is his unique power. So, he sneaked out of his room and went to the backyard. He closed his eyes and focused on everything around him, the wind, the sound, the grass, the nature.<br />
<br />
He can feel magic moving through his veins, something powerful, something special. He can feel it, now he just needed to release it. He raised his hands and extended his arms to the front, magic energy moving and fluctuating around him until he can feel it at his fingers tips. He took a deep breath and release it.<br />
<br />
A huge blast surrounded his home for a moment and June noticed through her window. She immediately knew it has to be related to her son somehow, so she quickly run downstairs until she came out of the house. An intense and a pink cloud were covering the whole backyard, but after a few seconds they dissipated. When her sight was clear, June was surprised of what she found.<br />
<br />
A man, maybe around his mid twenties was in there wearing her son&#39;s pajamas. Obviously the clothes were constricting his bigger body but at least he wasn&#39;t naked. She immediately realized it was Chad who somehow had used magic to grow up. It was his special power? She wasn&#39;t sure, but she definitely knew that she hasn&#39;t seen something like that before.<br />
<br />
The confused man turned around and unwittingly trying to adjust his tight clothes he approached June and said. &quot;Mom? Did I shrink you? I guess I shrunk the whole world!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, honey.&quot; June calmly replied as she took his bigger adult hands and noticed that his ring&#39;s jewel were completely white. She smiled and replied. &quot;You have grown. You&#39;re bigger now.&quot; Chad looked down at himself and finally realized it. He was open mouth watching his new self.</p>
