<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as I was to say something, Mrs. Brockman who was missing for a while came onto the stage.<br />
<br />
“Monica; I need to asked you something.” Mrs. Brockman announced as she came up to us.<br />
<br />
“Umm…Mrs. Brockman, can’t you see Joe is in a middle of a performance?” Asked Monica clearly uncomfortable with being the cause of the interruption.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Joe but this is important.” Mrs. Brockman apologizes to me which is a stark contrast to when I saw her on the street earlier. Then again she seem to have changed when I wished Monique into Monica and she never had a maid name Monique but why?<br />
<br />
“Monica have you seen your cousin Nadia?” Mrs. Brockman asked Monica. Nadia? Why does that name sound familiar.<br />
<br />
<b>= = =</b><br />
<br />
<i>“This is my sœur jumelle, Nadia” Monique said to me showing one of the few pictures she had of her home. “I’m older by 15 minutes, she is still in France and sometimes I miss her. Sometimes I miss my Oncle Jean-Luc but he and papa fell out of touch years ago. I sure wish I knew where he is so maybe I can live with him instead of living here as a maid.”</i><br />
<br />
<b>= =</b><br />
<br />
<i> “Jean-Luc, welcome to the party neighbor.” My dad said as family of three came over to celebrate my fifth birthday.<br />
<br />
“Not a problem Monsieur Flynn anything for the man who help me adapt well to this country.” A man in a heavy French accent said before gesturing to the woman and five year old girl next to him. “ This is my darling wife; Amelia and our delight full ball of light of a daughter; Monica.” Excited to make a new friend I rush up to the girl.<br />
<br />
“High I’m Joey. Wanna play?” I asked the five year old Monica. She nodded her head excitedly then I grabbed her hand and we rush off to play as the adults comment on how cute we look together. </i><br />
<br />
<b>= =</b><br />
<br />
<i>“Can you believe it Joey? My cousin aîné Nadia is coming to the USA.” 15 year old Monica said in excitement.<br />
<br />
“Awesome Monica; will she be staying with your family?” I asked her. She only shook her head.<br />
<br />
“Non, she is living with and working for a family called the Brockman’s.” Monica responded.</i><br />
<br />
<b>= =</b><br />
<br />
<i>“Hi I’m Brad.” Said fifteen year old Brad as he introduced himself to me on our first day of high school.</i><br />
<br />
<b>= =</b><br />
<br />
<i> “Mom this is my new friend; Joey.” Fifteen year old Brad said as introduce me to his mom.<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you and who is the girl with you?” Mrs. Brockman asked referring to fifteen year old Monica.<br />
<br />
“Monica Beaumont; pleasure to meet you Mrs. Brockman.” Monica said as she and I bowed.<br />
<br />
“Oh; you’re Nadia’s little cousin. My what polite people you brought home, Bradford.” Said Mrs. Brockman.</i><br />
<br />
<b>= =</b><br />
<br />
<i> &quot;Hi, Mrs. Bockman!&quot; I called to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hello Joey. Ready for Brad’s belated Birthday party?” Mrs. Brockman asked in curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I&#39;ve been helping him plan it, remember?&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
“Very good. Will you be bringing Monica with you?” Mrs. Brockman asked.<br />
<br />
“She would never miss out on an opportunity to see her cousin.” I answered with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Very true.” Mrs. Brockman said before sighing. “Sometimes I do wish you two would come over more often. You’re a better friend than those ingrates that Brad hangs out with.” Before leaving.</i><br />
<br />
<b>= = =</b><br />
<br />
Oh. That’s why. I realized that I really need to think out my wishes better before I make them reality altering. Sure two people I transgendered was somewhat thought out but the wish I use to turn Monique into Monica. Yeah I should have thought it through better; however was it really that bad?<br />
<br />
On one hand I robbed Nadia her twin sister; however by making Monique into Monica, I improved the relationship between their father and estranged uncle. Monique was now Jean-Luc’s daughter Monica and he is happily married with two children. It seems he also has better ties with his brother as well he has an apparent friendship with my father which lead to me and Monica to be childhood friends. Both parents were over the moon when I asked Monica to be my girlfriend.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I downgraded my friendship with Brad. With Monica being my childhood friend; I never met Brad until the beginning of high school. With her being my best friend, I never got influence a lot by Brad. He went from my best friend to friend of convenience at best.<br />
<br />
Then again Brad was a bit perverted and with Monica being there; my focus was on her as she went through puberty, not those playboys Brad show me in the original reality. In fact in this reality; my stupid first wish with the ring was more of curiosity rather than perverted thoughts. On second thought maybe it was a trade up. I never like how he looked at Monique in the original reality.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Oh Crap!’</i> I thought as I remember how bad Brad’s perversions could be. I remember that in the original reality; Monique’s Maid outfit for today; was a bit let’s just say look like they should be featured in a porno rather than be worn professionally. NowI remembered Nadia greeting me and Monica today; wearing the same outfit and was uncomfortable wearing it if I recall correctly, just like Monique in the original reality.<br />
<br />
…since she greeted me and Joe at the door.” Finished Monica; finally coming back to the here and now. I then decide to act pretending to look at the audience looking for someone.<br />
<br />
“Now that I see; Brad is not in the audience as well.” I commented alerting Mrs. Brockman to the fact.<br />
<br />
“What the hell! First Nadia is missing and now the birthday boy can’t even bother to show up to a show of one of his friends?” Ask Mrs. Brockman. This cause the people in audience to look at each other as if they are trying to find Brad themselves. I took this opportunity to go to the two boxes I use for the transgender trick to close them and lock them. I then I handed Monica the cane again and instruct her to hold it by the shaft again.<br />
<br />
“Now this is a dilemma but let’s make this part of my next trick.” I said returning to the front of the stage gaining the attention. “For this trick.” I started to say heading back to one of the boxes, mentally making a wish while doing so. “Me and my lovely assistant will  hit this boxes with the handle of our canes one time. This will cause Brad and Nadia to be transported from wherever they are to one of the two boxes.” I finished as I stand beside one box and Monica stand by the other.<br />
<br />
“Ready honey?” I asked as I raised the cane. “Ready dear!” Said Monica raising her cane. “One…Two…Three.” I said then we both tap our boxes with our canes. Load thumps were heard as if something heavy drop into the boxes.<br />
<br />
“What the hell?” Came a voice from my box and i knew that voice from anywhere; it was Brads.<br />
<br />
“Qu&#39;est-ce que le...Oh Dieu merci!” Came a voice almost identical from Monique’s from the box next to Monica’s.<br />
<br />
“Nadia is everything all right?’ Asked Monica.<br />
<br />
“Monica? C&#39;est vous? Peu importe où suis-je? Laisse-moi sortir d&#39;ici!” Nadia in the box replied and by the sound of it she was incredibly distress. Having a bad feeling about this I guided Monica to one spot in front of Nadia’s box and then guided Mrs. Brockman to another spot in front of the box. I then got between them and made a wish for the cane I was holding turn into a towel. I made a motion as the cane turn into a big thick towel making it look like I was unfolding it.<br />
<br />
“Hold this.” I instructed as I handed one end for Mrs. Brockman to hold then proceeded to give Monica the other end. They were now holding up the towel obscuring the audience view of the box. I then got in front of the box and proceed  to undo the lock. I proceed to open the door and make sure I was out of sight. Monica and Mrs. Brockman was shock as a nude Monique lookalike step out of the box on the verge of tears.<br />
<br />
Moving quickly they both wrapped the person in the towel. She was in shocked especially seeing an audience looking at her. She was nearly on a full blown panic attack when Monica got in front of her commanding her attention.<br />
<br />
“Nadia. It’s okay I’m here.” Monica said and as soon as she said that; Nadia embraced Monica.<br />
<br />
“Je...J&#39;avais tellement peur!” Nadia said between sobs. Mrs. Brockman quietly put her hand on Nadia shoulder. Nadia flinched when she finally acknowledged Mrs. Brockman’s presence. “Ma…Ma…Madame Brockman.” Nadia nervously said.<br />
<br />
“Nadia where….” Mrs. Brockman started to say when there were loud knocks coming from Brad’s box.<br />
<br />
“Mom? Mom is that you? Don’t listen to a word that girl said.” Brad’s voice came from the box. Nadia flinched at it. Noticing this; I made a silent wish as I went over to the box. I then made a dial turning motion on the box and by magic the banging seemed to stop. I then turn towards the audience who are flabbergasted by this.<br />
<br />
“There we go folks. I made sure no sound is no longer coming in or out of that box.” I announced to everyone. Mrs. Brockman nodded thanking me before turning back to Nadia.<br />
<br />
“Nadia. It’s okay now Brad can’t hurt you. What happened to you?” Asked Mrs. Brockman.<br />
<br />
“I went to confront Monsieur Brad after greeting all the guest to complain about the costume I was forced to wear.” Nadia started. “He then had me follow him to the guesthouse to make up the beds saying he has been sleeping in them.” Nadia continued.<br />
<br />
“Really, sure he been out late sometime but he should know better than to use the quest house.” Mrs. Brockman commented.<br />
<br />
“Turn out it was to just corner me in the bedroom. He then order me to get out of the costume and lay on the bed. I protested but he just said he can have you fire me if I don’t do what he said. So fearful of you I did as I was told.” Nadia said almost as if she was pleading.<br />
<br />
“That makes no sense. Sure I would believe Becky and Betty first but never Brad.” Mrs. Brockman said putting Nadia at ease.<br />
<br />
“He proceed to get naked, then mount me.” Nadia said earning a gasps from the audience. “As he was having his way he said thanked me for his ‘birthday present’ and said he was going to give me my birthday present.” Nadia continued.<br />
<br />
“That doesn’t make sense; your birthday is in…nine…months.” Monica started to say but realized the meaning now. Mrs. Brockman was in shock before she addressed Nadia.<br />
<br />
“Did he actually…” Mrs. Brockman started to asked. “Non. Next thing I knew I was in that boxed before he could finished.” Nadia interrupted however this did not stop Mrs. Brockman from becoming angry. She then turn to me.<br />
<br />
“Open that box!” She demanded angrily. I complied by unlocked the door and open it. A naked Brad stumbled out of the box and started to look around. He was shocked at there was an audience before his angry mother walking up to him.<br />
<br />
“Mother she’s…” SMACK. Mrs. Brockman slapped her son before he could get another word in.<br />
<br />
“How dare you! Raping Nadia! Planing to impregnate her! What were you thinking?” Asked an angry Mrs. Brockman.<br />
<br />
“What? I thought you like grandchildren.” Brad responded.<br />
<br />
“That is different! Granted I was a bit upset that Becky got pregnant while in college but that was consented to. What you did was rape; pure and simple.” Mrs. Brockman argued.<br />
<br />
“So what Nadia is our maid and servant. You hired her to be use however dad and I see fit. Besides I was expanding our families bloodline before I unexpectedly get a half sibling.” Brad fired back but that seems to enrage Mrs. Brockman.<br />
<br />
“YOU MORON!!! YOUR FATHER WOULD NEVER DO THAT CAUSE HE IS LOYAL TO ME!!! WHAT YOU’VE DONE NEARLY RUIN MINE AND OUR FAMILIES REPUTATION!!!” Mrs. Brockman exploded.<br />
<br />
“Huh.” Brad responded. Mrs. Brockman took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
“Nadia is the daughter of Patrick Beaumont; CEO of Sinclair Incorporations one of the biggest businesses in France. Nadia while heiress decided to get a decade worth of experience before committing to it.” Mrs. Brockman explained. “Patrick reach out to his brother Jean-Luc Beaumont; Monica’s father, and asked him if had any recommendations so she can start off small. He suggested that she work as a maid for four years so she can understand what working from the bottom will look like before working for a company.” Mrs. Brockman took a breath.<br />
<br />
“He recommended me because I can be strict. So she is supposed to work in this house for four years to understand the pressure of being hired would be like before she applies for a company with my recommendation. AND YOU NEARLY RUIN THAT!!!” Mrs. Brockman shouted. This took me by surprised and wonder if that why she treated Monique that way in the original reality.<br />
<br />
“Su…Su….Surely if I got her pregnant then she can just be a hou….” Brad started to say before Monica came up and kick him in the balls causing him to keel over. I decided to take control of the situation.<br />
<br />
“For my next trick I will be punishing Brad.” I announce to the audience who look like they were ready to come on stage to murder Brad. I then turn to Mrs. Brockman and asked how should go about it?<br />
<br />
Mrs. Brockman answer was…</p>
