<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mam there apeares to be an emergency distress signal from craft AT-1&quot; said Alice as Lina and Sofia entered the bridge, Viki and Lucy were already there, watching the distress recording before rewinding it and watching again, this was not a good sign thought Lina as she waddled up to her wives,<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, has something happened?&quot; Said Lina with a look of distress, Viki and Lucy shook their heads, gesturing for Lina to see for herself.<br />
<br />
Looking at the hologram, Lina saw Violet and Catherine&#39;s faces, covered in sand and dirt, the sound of panick in their voices, or what Lina could hear at least, the recording sound was glitchy and corrupted, but Lina and Sofia were able to decode what they were saying. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is AT-1 to Alice, we found it, we found what the hive are heading toward-......its amazing there- down here, but we-.......don&#39;t think we can make it back&quot; said Violet, her ears covered in sand and her fur matted down with dirt and vegetation, then Catherine&#39;s face appeared on the screen &quot;we found something down here its-......... and its massive, and feeding off the-.......but its on our trail, were afraid this may be the last you hear from us&quot; said Catherine with a smile &quot;tell Misty that her mommies are sorry, and we love her&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then the screen whent yellow, as a cloud of sand kicked up, then the sounds of screaming and roaring could be herd, a giant pair of yellow glowing eyes with a large glowing frill, could be seen through the sand, then the camera hit the stone floor with a thud, then the screaming stopped, and the cameras view slowly began to turn red, before the sound of footsteps could be herd coming closer.<br />
<br />
The last scene the camera showed was a large reptile shaped foot come crashing down on the camera, the room was silent, Lina felt her lip tremble and tears falling down her cheeks, her friends were gone, she sent them out there, she felt as if their blood was on her hands, and now they would never see their little girl again.<br />
<br />
Then everyone herd Misty begin to sniffle, before letting out a heart wrenching wail, &quot;MAMA!......MAMA!&quot; she screamed as she buried her face in Sofias hair as sobs wracked her body, her muffled crys could still be herd, which only mounted Linas guilt, Sofia had tears of her own bit she tried to sooth the grief struck baby in her arms as she attempted to wipe her own tears from her eyes, then Sofia looked up at Lina &quot;il take her to the workshop with me, il try my best to calm her, but I doubt I can do mutch, I don&#39;t share the said bond with her as they did, she was her birth mother, and I will never have that connection with her, but il do my best&quot; said Sofia as she waddled sadly out of the command car, Mistys wails failing as the door shut behind them.<br />
<br />
Then Lina&#39;s eyes began to glow, her pupils turning into snake like slits, her wites of her eyes turning jade green, her fists clenched and tears spilling down her face, her Babies were kicking and rolling violently, their mothers self hatred beginning to scare them &quot;Mother please stop&quot; cryed Storm &quot;yes mommy please I&#39;m scared&quot; said Echo as she sunk to the back of Linas womb in fear, Luna hugging into her closely for reassurance.<br />
<br />
Then lina felt two pairs of arms wrapped around her, snapping her head down she saw Viki and Lucy, hugging Lina close as they attempted to turn and ease her guilt, her pain, her hate, and somehow it worked, no matter how much she hated herself for what had happened, she loved her wives so much more, then it dawned on her that she had terrified her babies, feeling them all pressed as far back as her womb would alow, horrified by what she had done, she unbleached her fists and pressed her hands to her belly, hugging it with all the love she had &quot;mommy&#39;s sorry babies, so sorry&quot; she whispered as tears continued to fall, Viki and Lucy sat on the floor with Lina, simply holding her, giving her support, but Lina&#39;s tears stopped when she felt four small hands under hers, looking down into her translucent womb she saw Luna trying to hug Linas hand through her belly, Lina cupped both hands over her baby girl as Echo and Storm pressed against Lina&#39;s Womb walls, trying to help their mommy feel better<br />
<br />
&quot;Il be ok now&quot; said Lina, her voice horse from crying &quot;I just need to lie down and process all this&quot; she said as the she, Viki and Lucy walked out of the command car and towards the lounge.<br />
<br />
(Two weeks later)<br />
<br />
Lina groaned as she lay on the sofa bed, the closer they got to their destination, the bigger her babies got and the more active they became, Lina was lucky if she got three hours sleep now with the triplets constant rolling and kicking &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten into you girls but can mommy please, PLEASE, get some sleep, she whispered to her belly, hearing two groans from either side of her, apparently Viki and Lucy were in the same situation with Chloey and Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind giving my little angel the same advice?&quot; Said Viki sleepliy? Lina watched as a bulge from Chloeys foot rose from Vikis maternal swell and rolled across its surface, Viki then petting the bulge as it disappeared, Viki sighed &quot;she always does that, kicks up a fuss for attention, then goes quiet whenever I give it to her she goes quiet&quot; said Viki as she wiped the sweat from her body.<br />
<br />
Lina kissed Viki deeply, Viki moaning into Linas mouth as their tongues entertwinwd, both enjoying eachother taste before Lina pulled away and putting her hands on Vikis belly &quot;don&#39;t worry babe, she&#39;s just shy is all but I know she loves her Mama with all her little heart, don&#39;t you&quot; said Lina as she pressed a kiss into Vikis belly, Viki smiling before pulling Linas head back up to alow Viki to devour her lips once more. <br />
<br />
Then Viki let out a little squeak before moaning omin pleasure, a electrical tingle running up the length of her spine as she felt her nethers being invaded by three of Linas fingers &quot; ohhhhhh, your a naughty girl, and naughty girls need to be punished&quot; moaned Viki as she grabbed at Linas ass, while Lina slipped a fourth finger into Vikis pussy, spreading her fingers wide, Viki had to cover her mouth to muffle her orgasmic scream.<br />
<br />
Once Viki had come down from her outburst of plesure, she them smirked as she sat up, letting Linas now soaked fingers slide out of her then straddled over Linas face, her Pussy directly above Lina&#39;s mouth, Viki then turned to face Lina so her back was facing Linas belly before she put her finger to her lips, nodding towards Lucy who was fast asleep.<br />
<br />
Lina smiled before wiggling her eyebrows as she grabs Vikis hips and tilts them forward &quot;Let&#39;s get a taste shall we?&quot; Whispered Lina, but Viki couldn&#39;t take it any more and pressed her pussy against Linas mouth, the muffled voice of Lina sent vibrations through Vikis sensitive folds before they stoped, an Linas tongue entered deep into her birth canal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhhh right to my weak spot hey, you&#39;d better slow down babe or I can&#39;t guarantee we will be able to  mmmmmmm.....continue if we end up waking the little ones, oooooohhh funck yeah&quot; whispered Viki as she let out a small squirt of her vaginal fluids into Linas mouth, then lina felt the sofa bed move, and looking to her right she could see Lucy in full heat, with one hand massaging her breast and the other wrapped under her belly and fingering her own pussy.<br />
<br />
The moment of passion soon died down however when they all let out a groan and felt as the children within them whent bazerk, punching and kicking in all directions, then Alice&#39;s voice came over the speakers<br />
<br />
&quot;Mam we have arrived at the marked location, the enemy forces are two days out from us, if we&#39;re going to investigate this pillar of reality then now is the time</p>
