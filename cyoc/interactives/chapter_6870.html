<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>While Kieran, Peter, Alex, Greg, and Nick were all frolicking in their newly-acquired 
  speedos under the light of the midnight moon (somehow they couldn't manage to 
  stop having sex long enough to get back to camp), a few hours back, Paul and 
  Michael had already made their to the boy's camp and found that the troop's 
  two youngest scouts, Hugh and Scott, were left behind to finish setting up the 
  site. </p>
<p>Paul and Michael observed them quietly from a safe distance and decided they 
  would wait until the two friends, who also happened to be neighbors, were asleep 
  before they made their move. In the meantime, they went away to a secluded spot 
  in the forest and spent the time exhaustively exploring each other's bodies 
  and cumming several times in the process. The funny thing was no matter how 
  many times they came, they never seemed to run of juice (so to speak), which 
  was all absorbed into their red speedos. At the stroke of twelve, Paul and Michael 
  checked up on Hugh and Scott, and they snickered when they overheard the two 
  wondering where the hell the rest of their troop was.</p>
<p>"Jeez, I would have thought Nick would have been back bye now," said 
  Hugh.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's been hours. I hope they're all right," said Scott. "Do 
  you think something's happened to them?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so. I know there aren't any wild animals in this part of 
  the woods so I'm sure they're ok. Knowing them, they're probably enjoying themselves 
  right now."</p>
<p>"Well, at least we were able to get everything done. Good thing you decided 
  to cook only for two."</p>
<p>"You got that right. So Hugh, do we wait up for them? It's getting pretty 
  late."</p>
<p>"Nah, they've got their tents set up anyway. Let's hit the sack."</p>
<p>"I'm with ya. See you tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Night, Scott."</p>
<p>Paul and Michael watched in eager anticipation Hugh and Scott getting ready 
  for bed. They had to stifle their moans of admiration when they changed into 
  their white shirts and dark khaki boxers. Hugh was a little over 5'6", 
  but he looked much shorter thanks to his latent chubbiness due to his difficulty 
  to dispose of his baby fat even after years of scouting. He was cute in a pudgy 
  sort of way, and with his light brown hair and auburn eyes, Hugh still managed 
  to draw the attention of more than a few girls from his high school. </p>
<p>Scott, on the other hand, was the veritable beanpole. Ever since he hit puberty 
  a couple of years back, Scott had been growing, more like stretching, taller 
  and taller. His light and lanky 6'2" frame was still in the process of 
  growing some more, and the blonde-haired, blue-eyed boy never considered going 
  to the gym or anything of the sort. Being a scout was his life, and besides, 
  he was happy with how he looked so why bother changing?</p>
<p>As the two friends said their good nights one more time and entered their tents, 
  Paul and Michael contemplated on what to do next. Thirty minutes ought to be 
  enough time for the two teens to fall asleep.</p>
<p>"Who do you want?" asked Paul, who was massaging his boner in his 
  swimsuit.</p>
<p>"Oh God, you're letting me choose?" replied Michael. He was rubbing 
  his chest and tweaking a nipple with one of his fingers. "Fuck, I can't 
  decide. They both look great to me."</p>
<p>"They are," agreed Paul. "Fine, I'll make it easy for you. You 
  take Scott; I'll take Hugh, ok?"</p>
<p>"Ok."</p>
<p>Then the former-boy scout and the former-father figure cautiously left their 
  hiding place and made their way to Hugh and Scott's respective tents. With great 
  care and some deal of nervousness, they each opened the tent flaps and crept 
  inside. Thanks to the light of the full moon, Paul and Michael could see well 
  enough to proceed with their plans on passing on the speedo syndrome to two 
  more potential victims.</p>
<p>Hugh was already snoring when Paul crawled in. That's good, he thought. The 
  kid was always a fast and, more importantly, heavy sleeper. He studied the young 
  man's face in the moonlight and remarked that with a few pounds off his jowls, 
  Hugh could be one hell of a hunk. </p>
<p>Paul located the zipper to Hugh's sleeping bag and slowly pulled it down. He 
  would stop whenever he sensed Hugh shifting positions, and after a minute or 
  two, he would continue until he managed to fold away much of the sleeping bag 
  away from Hugh's body. Paul paused to admire his handiwork; Hugh was still sleeping 
  soundly with his stomach rising and falling in time with his breathing. Well, 
  Paul thought to himself, I'm not going to miss that paunch of his, that's for 
  sure.</p>
<p>In the other tent, Michael had an easier time exposing Scott who opted to use 
  a blanket, which was quickly set aside after a few well-placed tugs. Michael 
  found it so cute the way the thin teenager was shivering from the cold night 
  air but figured that wouldn't be a problem by the time he was through with him. 
  And so there was Scott all ripe and ready to be picked. Michael lay down beside 
  Scott and propped up his head on his bended arm. He could actually sense the 
  heat emanating from the boy's body, and with a smirk, he placed his free hand 
  on the hottest place of all--Scott's package.</p>
<p>At first he didn't do anything. Michael just let his hand rest comfortably 
  on the surface of Scott's boxers and felt the form of the scout's sleeping schlong 
  through the fabric. He waited to see if there was any reaction from the resting 
  youth, but aside from a couple of grunts, it was all clear. Michael then bit 
  by bit applied a little pressure on Scott's cock, and almost immediately, the 
  flaccid member filled with blood, and Michael particularly enjoyed how it pumped 
  itself into a full-blown erection right in the palm of his hand. First contact 
  had been established, and through it all, Scott remained unaware and asleep.</p>
<p>In contrast, Paul didn't know where to start. He imagined all the ways he could 
  have his way with Scott in his head, and he couldn't decide on the best way 
  to play this fantasy out. Should he kiss Hugh on the mouth, lick his feet, or 
  go straight for the cum-jugular? Should he use his distinct height and weight 
  advantage and rape him? The teen looked so young and innocent there sleeping--almost 
  cherubic even--but Paul knew there would be hell to play just as soon as he 
  can get his act together. In fact, he noticed that there had been some slight 
  movement in the boy's underwear a few minutes ago. In the end, he chose Door 
  Number 3: Hugh's dick. The Eagle Scout peered at its penile prey, and in one 
  swooping motion, his mouth alighted directly on the cloth-covered mound and 
  started licking and sucking the teen's cock through the boxers.</p>
<p>Right at that very minute, Hugh was in a middle of a dream where he was watching 
  his pretty neighbor getting ready for her bath. The long-haired woman was walking 
  around her living room wearing only a towel around her chest. Hugh always liked 
  this scenario because it afforded him the freedom to act out his voyeuristic 
  tendencies. He imagined himself to be inside his darkened room and sitting beside 
  the window and fondling his hardening cock as he ogled without a sound.</p>
<p>But then something strange began to happen. As soon as his neighbor unhooked 
  the towel from her body, Hugh's eyes nearly popped out in shock when the voluptuous 
  breasts he was expecting to admire were instead the big, well-developed chest 
  of a MALE! Hugh watched in horror as his neighbor abruptly morphed from a sexy 
  woman to an even sexier man. Suddenly, everything around him exploded in a flash 
  of light. When he opened his eyes, he wasn't in his room anymore; he was in 
  his neighbor's house, right in the very living room he secretly viewed from 
  afar, and there she--no, he--was waiting for him.</p>
<p>"Hey Hugh," the man greeted. He was very tall (around 6'5", 
  6'6") and well-muscled. He looked more like a fitness model rather than 
  a bodybuilder, and his face had phenomenal features: the bluest eyes, the blondest 
  hair, and the tannest skin. But what freaked out Hugh was the pair of red speedos 
  the man was wearing, and it sported an obscenely huge bulge. </p>
<p>Hugh wanted to run away like anything. All he had on was a pair of white briefs 
  with visible evidence of precum stains from his recently-interrupted masturbation 
  session. His hands instantly covered the offending material, and as much as 
  he wanted to flee, he was frozen on the spot. The man laughed at the boy's shyness 
  and said, "Oh, don't worry about it, Hugh. It's nothing I haven't seen 
  before."</p>
<p>Hugh stammered. "W-w-what are you t-talking a-a-about?" </p>
<p>"Well, it's just that I've been watching you too, and I thought I'd invite 
  you over so we can finally have a some fun together. How does that sound?"</p>
<p>"N-no... no, this can't be real. This is all a dream!"</p>
<p>"You got that right, my chubby little man. It's a dream all right, a dream 
  come true--for me. Now get over here."</p>
<p>"What? No way! I'm not gay!"</p>
<p>"Really? Somebody seems to think differently." The man grinned wildly 
  as he pointed to Hugh's growing erection in his briefs.</p>
<p>Hugh was horrified by his involuntary reaction. "Oh shit! I'm telling 
  you--this is all a mistake! Please, just let me go home. I promise never to 
  spy on you again!"</p>
<p>"No, it's too late for that. There's no turning back now," said the 
  man as he approached Hugh and pulled the teen's hands away from his crotch. 
  Hugh couldn't understand why he couldn't just hit the guy and get out of there, 
  but what was difficult to accept than that was how he now found himself inexplicably 
  drawn to this man who was unfathomably familiar. Hugh could have sworn he knew 
  this man, but that would have been impossible. He didn't know anyone this tall 
  and gorgeous. While his mind thought otherwise, every fibre of his body screamed 
  to be touched, held and squeezed by his neighbor. This had to be dream, it had 
  to be, Hugh cried to himself, all the while his lips were preparing to accept 
  the impending kiss from his neighbor--his very first.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Michael had been busy giving Scott some good vibrations as he continued 
  to play around with the 16-year-old's prick. By this time, there was a growing 
  dark spot near the waistband of his boxers that were taking on a titian tinge, 
  and Scott unconsciously began to seek out for more sexual stimulation by instinctively 
  humping Michael's hand in his sleep. Ah, nothing like overflowing hormones to 
  spice things up, Michael thought, and he scooped up a bit of Scott's precum 
  to taste its flavor. Mmmm, not bad, not bad at all.</p>
<p>The time for foreplay was done Michael decided. He hasn't even touched himself 
  since he stepped into Scott's tent, and he already so close to blowing his load. 
  Michael's heart was pounding as he watched Scott's underwear becoming smaller 
  and redder by the second--the sign that Scott was well on his way to becoming 
  the next Speedo Fag. With his hand firmly placed on Scott's crotch, Michael 
  pushed himself close to the teen's face and kissed him squarely on the lips.</p>
<p>Scott stirred slightly awake. "W-who...?"</p>
<p>"Sssshhh... You&#8217;re dreaming," Michael said. "Just enjoy 
  it."</p>
<p>"'K," Scott responded by kissing Michael back and catching him completely 
  off-guard. Whoa, realized Michael, there's more to this kid than I thought. 
  Scott surprised Michael even further by pushing him to the ground and getting 
  on top of him and proceeding to make out with his dream date.</p>
<p>"Oooh fuck..." Michael swooned as Scott's bony body began to beef 
  up. He loved how Scott's shirt swelled with sinewy muscle and mass, and before 
  it got too tight on him, he tore it off Scott's torso with one great big rip. 
  Michael couldn't believe that Scott was getting taller, as if he wasn't already 
  tall enough, and wider as well. Scott's delts and shoulders were hard and huge, 
  and his pecs were full and tight, but Michael nearly came just by watching Scott's 
  face mature and become impossibly gorgeous.</p>
<p>Michael was impressed by how much the boy had grown. In a matter of minutes, 
  skinny 6'3" Scott had super-sized to a 6'6" 21-year-old giant with 
  over 230 lbs. of hard, bulging, gym-toned muscles, and best of all, his khaki 
  boxers were now finally gone and replaced by a pair of red speedos that were 
  struggling to contain its new package. Michael just sighed contentedly and let 
  Scott do all the work. </p>
<p>In the meantime, Hugh was stuck in his dream. His neighbor, who was once a 
  stunning woman but now a strapping man, was giving him a kiss of a lifetime 
  which Hugh found abhorrent in the beginning, but the longer he was forced to 
  endure the experience, the weaker his resistance became. Soon, he was intrigued 
  by the sensations. Fuck, he thought to himself, what are you doing Hugh? Stop 
  it! You're not gay, why are you enjoying this? Noooo...</p>
<p>The voice in Hugh's mind slowly faded into the background, and all that was 
  left was a longing for the sweet caress of his neighbor's lips, which unexpectedly 
  left his own. Hugh's mouth felt empty and useless. </p>
<p>"Wh-why did you stop?" he asked, perplexed. "Was I doing it 
  wrong?" He felt ashamed and inadequate.</p>
<p>The man smiled warmly. "No, no. You were great. I was wondering if you 
  could do something for me."</p>
<p>"Anything," Hugh gushed. He wanted nothing more but to please this 
  man any way he could.</p>
<p>"See those red speedos over there on the drawer?"</p>
<p>"Uh-huh."</p>
<p>"I want you to put them on."</p>
<p>"Ummmm... I'm not sure that's such a good idea."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure I'll look freaky in them. If you haven't noticed, I'm not exactly 
  Baywatch material."</p>
<p>"Oh, please... it would make me really happy."</p>
<p>As much as Hugh wanted to, he couldn't say no, or was that wouldn't? "Well, 
  all right. Is there anywhere I can change."</p>
<p>"Right here is fine."</p>
<p>"You sure it's ok?"</p>
<p>The man nodded, and Hugh went and picked up the speedo from the drawer. He 
  gave it a quick scan and determined that it was more or less his size. With 
  a sigh, he stepped out of his briefs and started pulling up the speedo up his 
  stubby legs. Halfway through, it became more difficult to chuck it past his 
  thick thighs but he eventually managed to squeeze in. He frowned over how fat 
  he looked with his flab hanging loosely around the swimsuit that housed his 
  piddly 4-inch erection, but when he turned around, he saw the man smiling at 
  him.</p>
<p>"You're beautiful," he said. "Now, come here."</p>
<p>Whatever shame or embarrassment he felt disappeared, and Hugh experienced an 
  overwhelming urge to be kissed again--this not just on the lips but all over. 
  In fact, he didn't even wait to be asked anymore; he just went for it. He literally 
  bounced off the floor and into the waiting arms of his neighbor, and the two 
  kissed deeply and fervently. Hugh never felt anything like this before. His 
  entire body was alive with a sensual passion he never conceived himself of having, 
  and his cock had gotten so hard, so fast it actually hurt, but it never felt 
  so good. They navigated their way from the living room to the bedroom, all the 
  while their lips were locked, and when they got there, Hugh's neighbor went 
  down on him.</p>
<p>That was when Paul noticed the change in Hugh's body back in the "real 
  world." While he lapped at Hugh's boxers, he sensed the material of the 
  underwear giving way to the speedo's scarlet sheen. He opened his eyes and saw 
  that Hugh's transformation into a Speedo Fag was about to begin. First and most 
  notably, Hugh's stomach started to deflate rapidly. His arms and legs thinned 
  considerably as his face revealed just how handsome he could get. Second, his 
  body began to build up muscle especially in his chest and shoulders. As all 
  the fat melted away into oblivion, his skin tightened and toned and even tanned. 
  His abdominals molded from a lump of dough into a tasty-looking breadbasket. 
  Next, his legs stretched downwards as his torso pushed upwards. Not only was 
  Hugh getting bigger, he was becoming older as well. And lastly, his cock grew 
  bigger and bigger to the point that Paul was having a hard time keeping up. 
  Fuck, that must be some dream, Paul thought.</p>
<p>Hugh's physical body changed at the same time he underwent his imaginary metamorphosis, 
  which he fully and readily accepted. (After all, it was all a dream, right?) 
  At first he didn't know what was happening. He felt a sensation of tightness 
  and heaviness all around his body, but he attributed that to his excitement 
  over his neighborly lovemaking and ignored it. He remained oblivious to his 
  transfiguration even after his neighbor gently pushed Hugh away from him.</p>
<p>"What did I do this time?" he asked and then wondered whose voice 
  he had just heard. "What the? Was that me?"</p>
<p>"Surprise!" grinned the neighbor. "Go take a look at yourself 
  at the mirror over there."</p>
<p>"Oh fuck!" gasped Hugh when he realized it wasn't only his voice 
  that changed. There in the mirror was a reflection of a muscular, athletic and 
  virile-looking 20-year-old, and Hugh was startled when it began moving whenever 
  he moved. He couldn't believe it but that was *his* reflection he was seeing. 
  He stood up from the bed and went for a closer look. He flexed his newly-discovered 
  muscles from his bulging biceps down to his quivering calves and was amazed 
  by what he saw. He was now at least 6'2" and probably weighed a little 
  more than 190 lbs. and that wasn't from fat anymore. The only thing fat about 
  him now was his 12" cock straining to jump out of his perfectly-fitted 
  red speedos. "No. Fucking. Way."</p>
<p>Hugh's neighbor came up in front of him and gave him a peck on the lips. "Like 
  I said, you're beautiful. Now do you believe me?" Before Hugh could answer, 
  his neighbor gave him another peck this time on his neck, then another down 
  on his chest, then his abs until he was kneeling down in from of Hugh and kissing 
  his cock. Hugh groaned approvingly, and his neighbor didn't miss a beat and 
  began to service the foot-long phallus in earnest. </p>
<p>"Shit," Hugh whispered.</p>
<p>Paul looked up thinking Hugh had awakened, but saw that his phat boy was just 
  talking in his sleep. Paul thought he must be getting close to shooting, and 
  he gave it all he got. Hugh moaned and mumbled incoherently and moved about 
  a bit more, but he never woke up; he was far too caught up with his dream, and 
  he wanted to see it through till the very end. He was nearly at the climax, 
  as were Michael and Scott who were sixty-nining each other in the next tent. 
  It took a bit of adjusting to do considering how much taller Scott was now to 
  Michael, but they managed to find a good position and an even better rhythm 
  to their horizontal mambo. </p>
<p>Paul pounded his cock inside his red speedos, and Hugh humped Paul's mouth 
  in delight as his big balls tightened up his body, and Michael munched on his 
  partner's prick, and Scott just sucked and sucked and sucked Michael who couldn't 
  hold back any longer. Michael shook violently as he started shooting in his 
  swimsuit, and he couldn't help but clamp his lips down on Scott's cock and the 
  intense pressure caused the scout to spread his seed in his speedos as well. 
</p>
<p>At that very moment, Paul could feel he was about to cum and had to slow things 
  down until his friend had unleashed his load first. If he only knew just how 
  much Hugh was thoroughly enjoying himself in both mind and body as he was sucked 
  in his dreams and in reality thanks to his neighbor and to Paul. The double-header 
  was eventually too much for Hugh to handle, and his cocks exploded in a vol-cum-ic 
  eruption that was absorbed and contained by his crimson trunks. Paul was so 
  relieved that Hugh finally spewed that he sped up his self-gratifying strokes 
  for maximum effect. Within seconds, he silently screamed just as he hit his 
  long-overdue orgasm, and even he had to admit it was the best he had had ever 
  since he first became a Speedo Fag. (Somebody once told him that &#8220;good 
  things cum to those who wait&#8221;--well, not exactly.)</p>
<p>Paul lay down on his back and basked in the afterglow that lingered on for 
  quite a while. He then turned on his side to check up on Hugh and was astounded 
  to see that he had slept through the entire thing. In fact, once the cum had 
  all but disappeared from his speedos, Hugh immediately started snoring again 
  but with a slight smile of contentment on his handsome face. He was imagining 
  that he was nuzzling his neighbor after their wild episode. Paul chuckled at 
  the thought that Hugh was going to have a very nice surprise when he woke up 
  in the morning, but right now, he and Michael had to get back to the city.</p>
<p>Paul stuck his head outside Hugh's tent and saw that Michael was already there 
  waiting for him. Paul flashed him a thumbs-up sign, which Michael returned with 
  one of his own. The meaning was clear: mission accomplished and a job well done. 
  After a quick exchange of highlights of the night's events, Paul and Michael 
  left the campsite just as quietly as they slipped in. Michael's son Ben and 
  his friends were sure ask what happened during their camping trip, and boy, 
  did they have some stories to share.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Scott was the first one to wake up at the crack of dawn, and he felt like he 
  had just had the best night of his life. He was full of energy, and he figured 
  he ought to make the most out of it by getting started early in the day. He 
  immediately wondered if Nick and the rest their troop had already returned to 
  the camp, and he pulled off his blanket to get up. "Man, the air's pretty 
  nippy this morning," he said to himself. "Feels as if I'm not wearing... 
  any... thing."</p>
<p>Scott's train of thought was derailed when he saw himself for the first time. 
  He was big. No, he was huge, enormous, humongous. What happened to his clothes? 
  Where did all this muscle come from? And what the hell was he doing wearing 
  nothing but these trunks? His initial jolt quickly wore off, and he rushed out 
  of his tent calling out for his friend with a voice that boomed with deep baritone. 
  "Hugh! Hugh! Wake up, Hugh!"</p>
<p>He ran towards Hugh's tent and opened the flap. "Hugh, you've got to see..." 
  What he saw sent him reeling from shock and awe. Instead finding his fat 15-year-old 
  friend inside the tent, there was fit young man who had on pair of red speedos 
  just like his. There was no way this could be Hugh, Scott thought. </p>
<p>The stranger stirred and asked, "Uuhhh... what time is it, Scott? What's 
  with all the shouting?"</p>
<p>"Oh my God, it *is* you..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, who else could it be? Hey, are you getting a cold?" Hugh hadn't 
  opened his eyes yet, and Scott stepped back and watched Hugh rouse and rise 
  up from his sleeping bag. Rubbing his eyes, Hugh stepped out of tent and was 
  still unaware of anything that had happened to him. "Man, that was crazy-ass 
  dream I had; course I can't remember a thing now. Funny how that always..."</p>
<p>Hugh had expected to see Scott when his vision cleared, but in his friend's 
  place was someone he had just met once upon a dream that started slowly coming 
  back to him.</p>
<p>"Holy shit! It's you!" gasped Hugh.</p>
<p>"Yes, Hugh. It's me Scott."</p>
<p>"Scott? No, you couldn't be Scott! I mean, that's impossible! You were 
  the guy in my dream! Oh fuck, I can't believe this! Scott! Scott! Where are 
  you?"</p>
<p>"Hugh, listen to me--*I'm* Scott. And what dream are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Get the fuck away from me! Help! Somebody help me!" </p>
<p>"Hugh, you've got to believe me! Something to happened to me... to us. 
  Please, just take a look at yourself..."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"Please..."</p>
<p>Hugh was tense with fear, but he stopped backing away from the pretender who 
  claimed to be Scott, and he cautiously took his eyes off of him, looked down, 
  saw his body and was left speechless. He started feeling different parts of 
  his body to see he wasn't imagining things. He looked at Scott and back at himself 
  and tried to reason that he was still asleep, but he couldn't refute the evidence. 
  He was no longer a teen-aged scout but a fully-grown man who had no idea how 
  it happened. Hugh felt very alone and afraid as did Scott who could do nothing 
  but hope that his friend would believe him. Scott tentatively approached Hugh 
  who seemed resigned to their new reality.</p>
<p>"S-Scott?" asked Hugh.</p>
<p>"Yes," Scott replied.</p>
<p>"What...? Do you...? How...?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Hugh. I'm just lost as you are. When I woke up this morning 
  I was already this way. The only thing I know is that it happened last night 
  while we were sleeping."</p>
<p>"Look at us. How are we supposed to go home? What are our parents going 
  to say?" cried Hugh.</p>
<p>"I don't know, but we'll manage somehow--together," said Scott as 
  he placed his arm around his friend. At the moment their bare skins made contact, 
  something rushed right through their bodies, and Hugh felt faint and almost 
  fell to ground where he not caught by Scott's muscular arms. Hugh looked up 
  and sensed all the care and concern radiating from Scott's face, and he never 
  felt safer. </p>
<p>"It was real..." Hugh said. "My dream was real. That's why I 
  thought I recognized him. It was you the entire time."</p>
<p>"You're going to have to tell me what that's all about, Hugh," smiled 
  Scott, and the two embraced each other. As they were hugging, Scott couldn't 
  help himself and bent down and kissed Hugh on the forehead. Hugh raised his 
  head and responded by kissing Scott on the lips. Scott was so happy, and so 
  was Hugh. Then, they kissed again a bit longer this time, then another. Next, 
  they were kissing each other with their mouths open and tongues touching, and 
  their osculation intensified to the point they were rolling on the ground and 
  simply couldn't get enough of each other. Soon enough, they were cumming together 
  in their red speedos, and as they were in their orgasmic throes, they realized 
  what they had become and what they had to do: they were Speedo Fags, and they 
  had to spread the disease!</p>
<p>From nowhere, someone shouted, "Hey! Hey! Hey! What's going on around 
  here?"</p>
<p>Hugh and Scott looked up from the ground and saw...</p></p>
