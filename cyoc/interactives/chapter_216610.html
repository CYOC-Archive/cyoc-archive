<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Jeff had left, Sayaka grins down at the boy’s phone, “this App is amazing,” she says, “with it I could do anything, I could fix some errors and even become a Queen… no… I’d be a GODDESS! It feels so freaking great, having power over others… hehe… oh, yes… it won’t take long until everyone will fear and worship Sayaka Sato!”<br />
<br />
Sayaka then gets a thought, “I probably should transfer the App onto MY phone,” she says to herself, “in case someone manages to snatch the losers phone from me and use the App against me. No, I can NOT let that happen!”<br />
<br />
The girl takes out her phone and activates her Bluetooth and the Bluetooth on Jeff’s phone. Sayaka then selects the Chronivac-App to be transferred onto her phone, a message pops up, which reads, “WARNING: if you transfer the App to a different device, the App will be deleted on the original device. Do you wish to proceed?”<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Sayaka confirms the transfer, after a few minutes, both phones give of a “ping” sound and a message appears on both phone, “transfer complete”. Sayaka grins, “perfect, I can’t wait to use my new power to fix the world. To make it the way I WANT it to be,” laughing manically to herself, the girl heads towards her next class, after putting both phones into her handbag.<br />
<br />
When Sayaka enters her next class, she sees Cronelia sitting at her desk, the smaller girl’s head stuffed in a book, not yet noticing that Sayaka has returned. The pink haired girl grins, ‘time to have some fun with Corny, but first,’ she thinks to herself and takes out her phone. Sayaka opens the App and scans Cornelia, she then taps on a button labeled, “save body”, the option allowing Sayaka to create copies of the body she scans to use to transform someone else into a clone of the original. After Cornelia’s body is saved, Sayaka opens the girl’s file, ‘now that I have “Jess”, I won’t be needing this squirt. So, why not change her into a 14 year-old boy,’ she asks herself. After Sayaka changed Cornelia’s gender and age, the girl gets an idea, a evil grin appears on her face, ‘I know of a “girl” who is single and who’d just “love” to have a boyfriend,’ with that, she changes Cornelia’s love interest from a guy called “Ken Armstrong” to “Jess Davis” and alters the girl’s mind to make her see Jeff as a girl. Sayaka’s grin widens as she continues to edit her friend, she sets the time for the transformation to take until 12 AM the following day and the duration to be permanent. Then she alters the reality so that everyone, except Jeff and Cornelia will think that Cornelia always has been a boy and Jeff a girl. As a final change, Sayaka writes “Carl” between “Cornelia” and “Thompson”, causing the soon-to-be boy to react to both names, she also turns Cornelia’s awareness on, so that the small girl will notice herself transforming, and freak out. After looking over the changes, Sayaka nods, ‘that should do for now,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I can change more later if needed,’ with that the girl confirms the settings, and puts her phone back into her pocket.<br />
<br />
As Sayaka looks up she notices Cornelia rub at her temples, the pink haired girl grins, ‘looks like the mental changes have already started,’ she then walks over to her friend, “hey Carl, sorry for keeping you waiting,” she says.<br />
<br />
Cornelia looks up at Sayaka, “no problem Saya… wait… what did you call me?”<br />
<br />
Sayaka grins inwardly, ‘works like a charm,’ she then says, “I called you by your name, of course, or isn’t “Carl” your middle name?”<br />
<br />
Cornelia flinches, she then looks around hastily, “keep it down, will you,” she whispers.<br />
<br />
Sayaka grins, “why,” she asks, “the name suits you”.<br />
<br />
Cornelia scowls at Sayaka, “you know I hate that name,” she says, “I am a GIRL and NOT a… boy!”<br />
<br />
Sayaka just continues to grin, “well, you are not really acting much like a girl,” she says, “you are more of a tomboy! So, I think “Carl” should be your main name and NOT “Cornelia”. Besides, it’s just a name, a really cool name at that, just go with it”.<br />
<br />
Cornelia lowers her head, “it… it’s embarrassing,” she says.<br />
<br />
Sayaka smirks, ‘this is so much fun,’ she thinks to herself, she then sits down next to the girl, “listen Carl,” she says, sticking with Cornelia’s “middle name”, “if you are honest, you actually like the name. Think about it, doesn’t it feel right? I mean, your body and especially your personality is in every way boyish. I think… the reason why you hate the name so much, is because you actually feel that you should have been born as a boy, am I right?”<br />
<br />
Cornelia looks up at Sayaka, “n-now that is stupid,” she says, then she looks away. After a few minutes of silence she then says, “you know… when I think about it… y-you are right! I… I hate being a girl… this… this body feels so wrong! I… I wish I were a boy”. Cornelia looks up at Sayaka, “wh-what is wrong with me,” she asks, “I felt normal this morning! I feel so weird… almost as if… as if my body and mind are changing!”<br />
<br />
“Maybe your body is starting to develop in the right direction,” she says, “maybe you are slowly transforming into the gender you are supposed to be!”<br />
<br />
“B-but… that is impossible,” Cornelia says, “but… I… I can feel that you… you might be right! I… I hope it is not just my imagination! I… I really wish I were a boy!”<br />
<br />
‘Hehe, I think I had enough fun with her,’ Sayaka says, ‘time to officially make “Carl” her real name and make her feel excited that her body is transforming into the “right” gender’. Sayaka pulls out her phone, “who knows, Carl,” she says as she types into her phone, “your wish might come true”. After Sayaka confirmed the changes she looks over at “Carl”, she grins when she notices the fear in Cornelia’s eyes become replaced by excitement, “you look excited, Carl,” she says.<br />
<br />
Cornelia, now Carl, grins, “hell yeah I am,” she says, “my body is finally developing into the right direction! I am sick and tired of pretending to be a girl and to wear girl clothes. I can’t wait to be my true self!”<br />
<br />
Sayaka grins, “I thought something exciting must be happening,” she says, “you have been acting super excited the whole day”.<br />
<br />
Cornelia chuckles, “hehe… well… I never have been able to mask my true feelings,” she says, “I… I just hope we’ll still be friends, even after I’m no longer a girl”.<br />
<br />
Sayaka smiles, “of course,” she says, “I still like you, Carl. You don’t have to worry about me dumping you”.<br />
<br />
Cornelia smiles, “by the way,” she then says, “have you seen Jess around today? I… kinda would like to… um… ask her something”.<br />
<br />
Sayaka smiles, “let me guess,” she says, “you have a crush on her and would like to ask her out?”<br />
<br />
Carl blushes, “y-yeah,” she says, “Jess… Jess is so hot! She is the hottest and sexiest girl in the whole universe… um… n-no offense,” she then quickly adds.<br />
<br />
Sayaka grins, “oh… I am not offended,” she says, “but… don’t you think you are a little to young for her? Besides, you don’t look like a boy… well, not yet at least, so I doubt she’d say “yes” to your question, on top of that, you are at least half a head smaller than her”.<br />
<br />
“B-but I’m 14… she is 16… th-that should be okay… I mean… to be together…,” the “boy” says, “m-maybe I’ll gain a growth spurt,” “he” adds.<br />
<br />
“Well… sure… but, it is up to Jess if SHE wants it,” Sayaka says, “you should take it slow, first, you should wait until your body has finished becoming your real gender, then second, you should ask her out and see what happens. Don’t worry… I’ll be there to support and help you”.<br />
<br />
Carl looks up at Sayaka, “really? Y-you’d really help me get the girl?”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Sayaka says, smiling, “that is what friends do, right?”<br />
<br />
Carl grins, “hehe… yep,” he says, “thanks, Sayaka. I feel so much better, it really has been a lovely conversation, thanks for comforting me”.<br />
<br />
Sayaka grins, “no problem, Carl,” she says, “now, let’s focus on the class, before the teacher notices us talking”.<br />
<br />
“R-right,” the “boy” says, ‘I hope I’ll be my true self tomorrow. I don’t want Jess dating someone else… she is MINE! With the help of Sayaka, I’m sure she’ll be mine soon,’ “he” thinks to “himself”.<br />
<br />
Sayaka smirks, ‘I think I’ll swap their hights,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I’ll make “Carl” 5’ 7’’, and Jeff 5’ 3’’, so that “Jess” will be half a head shorter than “Carl”. Hehe… this is so much fun,’ so she pulls out her phone and edits Cornelia’s and Jeff’s files, after confirming the changes, the girl puts her phone back into her bag, ‘tomorrow, both will have their “natural” heights… hehe… I can’t WAIT to see the look on Jeff’s face when “Carl” starts to flirt with “HER”! HAHAHA…,’ she thinks to herself, grinning inwardly.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in Jeff’s class, Jeff is sitting at his desk, deep in thought, ‘how am I supposed to get out of this mess,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I am unable to get even near my phone, I am unable to tell anyone what is happening and these… underware is starting to feel… good! I thought girl clothes would be uncomfortable, especially in the crotch area, but… it actually feels really nice and snug. SHIT! WHAT AM I THINKING!? I GOT TO STOP THIS BEFORE IT GETS WORSE! BUT HOW?!’</p>
