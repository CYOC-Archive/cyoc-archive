<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The upper half of the body she was now sporting was supported at an angle by Pete almost like sitting in a dentist chair which gave David's wandering eyes a great view of her new body as they tilted downward. A gasp of shock rang out of her mouth in a high feminine tone as her hand instinctively covered it. David was in a bikini and high heels as her earlier suppositions were indeed correct. The bikini top was quite tight but form fitting and allowed her breasts to push out with no sag in the fabric almost like it was made out of leather. The bottoms were quite tight as well and the strings really hugged her sides in a tight but comfortable way. The main piece of fabric was small but not to the point of it being a thong, David thought it was called minimal coverage. Both pieces were an aqua blue color but had what looked like fish scales hanging from the main pieces of fabric David knew this type of material was called sequin and thought they made the suit look quite sexy on her. David then snapped out of her admiration trance and realized that she had breasts and a girls body! David's breast were quite supple and strained at the top confining them. David thought they looked to be a "C" size. David looked at her flawless and pink skin marveling at its radiance and grabbed a tush of hair to stare at and curl with her finger estimating it to be at a length halfway down her back. David's eyes then went down her body to her toned abdomen and Pete's arm around it at this sight David gave Pete a smirking smile which he returned then returned her gaze to her crotch, wide hips, large cushioned butt (which she could feel mushed on the ground), shapely legs and pretty feet with the red painted toenails. The high heels were sandals was well and the gold color to them made David blush with how cute they looked on her. They were mid length in height at several inches and David shuddered when thinking back to why he couldn't stand in them in the first place.<br />
<br />
Knowing it was time to snap out of this daze David turned to Pete and asked him if he could help her up. Pete answered "of course Dave" while he stood and used his arms already grasping David to lift her up with him. Regaining herself on her feet wasn't easy as she immediately fell over to her side and was caught again in the arms of Pete. Thanking Pete again David flicked some stray hair out of her face and tucked it behind her ear while she wobbled in her heels keeping her legs wide for more balance. David again looked to Pete and asked: "Hey Pete I know this is going to sound strange but could you grab my hips and support me as I walk to my desk and get to the pen?" Pete had been staring in disbelief that this bombshell beauty spreading her legs in front of him while turned away was his best friend and work partner David but when she turned her head and asked for his help he met her eyes and agreed wholeheartedly in order to hold her again. Pete grabbed her hips where the bikini strings rested as Dave let out a very feminine giggle at the ticklish feeling and he supported her while she took very slow deliberate steps to the desk across the room.<br />
<br />
Leaning on the desk and snatching up her pen David begins to write on the notepad: "I know how to expertly and sexily walk in high heels" at finishing David all of a sudden felt like she didn't need to lean on the desk anymore and stood up straight with her body turned to Pete and the pen still in her hand as her arms crossed together under her breasts. Pete notices and says "Whoa Dave you fixed your wobble, your now standing straight, you look gorgeous by the way" Dave shoots back: "Yeah sure just don't get any funny ideas, its still me in here even with this new equipment" Dave pouts his lips and meets Pete's stare before replying "I wanted to thank you again for everything as I was unprepared for the changes that this writing wrought." "Sure no problem what are friends for" Pete replied as a slight smile met both their lips. Dave began again "because you helped me I will let you get one wish that I will write down for you to make into reality" "really anything I want" Pete said "almost anything and you know what not" Dave replied. Pete knew exactly what he was talking about in that he couldn't change Dave in any way but that was exactly was Pete wanted and knew a way to get around it. "I want to temporarily take your position in the company while retaining my name and life while you to stay the way you are and become my secretary until tomorrow" said Pete with envious eyes. Dave knew where this was headed and even though she was quite comfortable in this form after her last wish she didn't want to stay like this for a whole day and night let alone give herself and her position up for a secretarial lot but Pete did save her from getting hurt and she didn't want to hurt his feelings so she agreed. <br />
<br />
"Alright Pete you win I won't wish myself back to a male until tomorrow and I'll become your secretary, but I need to change out of this bikini for I can't go walking around the office like this" Dave said as she dropped her arms to her side slowly with her hands uncurling in a revealing motion. Pete began again "no I want you to stay in that bikini for the rest of the day and night. I know its a strange request but you look really good in it and seeing you with it on makes me happy" Dave blushed at this remark and couldn't deny how good she looked" "OK Pete I'll keep the bikini on but I am going to have to change reality a little bit in order to fit in around here" Dave grabbed a notepad on the desk and began writing several lines " Pete now has David's position in the company and I, David in this female form is his secretary until tomorrow afternoon at 2 PM where everything will turn back to the way it was before I turned myself into Pete's dream girl". Without missing a beat Dave continued writing "Pete and I will always remember who we were before the changes and our sense of true self will not change but everyone else will change and think the order of the company has always functioned like the wish makes it, also anything I wear including my current outfit or anything revealing won't cause any alarm to the staff or the world as people you know me will think that I've always dressed like this and that it is actually allowed in the company dress code applying to me only." Thinking about what Pete wanted Dave added: "I am not allowed to take off this bikini or high heels until the wish changes me back tomorrow or Pete says otherwise, if I try to take anything off in its entirety or try to put anything else on to cover my self up I will become physically ill but the illness will disappear when I but the garments back on or remove the covering clothes." Dave remembered one more thing before stopping "My name is temporarily changed to Danielle Travers a 19 year old aspiring model who works as Pete Simpson's secretary. Everyone calls me Danni for short." David thought that was all that was needed but she could have sworn that maybe there was one other thing she was forgetting. Dave looked up at Pete and both of them smiled as David began to lift the pen off the paper.</p>
