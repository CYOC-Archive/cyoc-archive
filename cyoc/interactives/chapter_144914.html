<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He dog penis erect, Tobias stared down at it, thinking. Close by he could not only hear the two wolves moving silently about, but he could also smell them. The male had an earthy dog-smell to him, whilst the female, because she was in heat, had a rich smell that he knew was her sex. Desperately, he wanted to go to her and satisfy both of their needs. And if not go to her, simply fulfill his lust using one hand.<br />
<br />
Yet, he was leery to do so. A feeling creeping over him and he found himself thinking about the teeth and the tail he now had. Something whispered in his mind that, somehow, these mutations had grown because he had had masturbated and, one time, had had sex. Mumbling, &quot;Somehow, every time I give into my sexual desires, I lose a little bit more of myself. Become more of a dog,&quot; and tittering nervously, he thought, &quot;That is the most ridiculous thing I&#39;ve heard heard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Absently, he ran his hand through his short hair, trying to decide on whether he was onto something or way off base. His hand brushing against his ears, he muttered, &quot;Oh, yeah. How could I forgotten those,&quot; and still staring at the erect member, noting how weird it was to see his balls attached to base of the shaft, he tried to sort of a way to prove or disprove that sex and masturbation was turning him into a dog.<br />
<br />
Secretly, he knew and understood how he could test his theory. But, at the same time, he was hesitant to do so. Looking in the direction of the wolves, seeing the female sitting a couple feet away, watching him, Tobias grimaced. Remembering what had happened the last thing, he quickly pushed the urge to copulate with her out of his mind, fearing that if he dwelled on it too much, he&#39;d give in, which would likely lead him to once more stuck inside her vagina until they both were sated sexually. Unsure how he&#39;d gotten stuck, still unfamiliar with his new anatomy, Tobias considered his other option, to stroke it until he came.<br />
<br />
&quot;But there in lies a complication,&quot; he told himself as he studied the red, erect member, searching for a clue as to why he&#39;d gotten stuck and thinking it might be because it somehow swelled up.<br />
<br />
This immediately led him to wonder if maybe what he was looking at was not a full canine erection, which lead him to speculate on what it might look like fully erect. Suddenly embarrassed by what he was thinking, he breathed deeply. Telling himself, &quot;Calm down. Ignore it,&quot; he hoped that by doing so, his penis would slip back into the sheath.<br />
<br />
As he did this, he turned his thoughts back to trying to sort out if masturbation and sex was in some way was turning him into a dog. On the one hand, he considered this to be the most ludicrous thing he&#39;d ever considered. He&#39;d masturbated before. And one time, on a date, he&#39;d almost come close to having sex. But, before that could happen, he and the girl, &quot;Katie,&quot; he recalled aloud, had decided to wait a bit. Unfortunately, they had broken it off after a bit and he&#39;d seen anyone since. This train of thought brought Tobias back to how he had masturbated in the past, that he&#39;d been doing so since he&#39;d been about fourteen or so and that it had been his brother who&#39;d gotten him his first girlie magazine.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in none of those occasions had I experience anything as weird as what is happening now,&quot; he announced.<br />
<br />
The wolf getting up and walking closer, Tobias snapped his head up, alert. Watching as she drew closer, he sniffed and suddenly was aware of what she wanted as she made a series of noises. Watching as she drew close, raised her head and nipped at the hem of his shirt, which was starting to look kind of ragged, he felt his resolve weaken. Shaken, he reached down and ran a hand through her fur, telling her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. But, I think, it&#39;s causing me, problems,&quot; in a trembling tone.<br />
<br />
The bitch making another series of barks, yips and whines, leapt back, turned and presented herself. Looking down at his erect member, the sheath is would slide into and the white fur surrounding it, Tobias shuddered. Searching about for his pants, thinking it had been a mistake to even look at it, he watched the wolf as she continued to send signals on what she wanted. Thoughts of penetrating her springing to mind, Tobias wondered if maybe it would worth it if it would present him with some answers. Taking a step closer, smelling the barest hint of her sex, he thought about bringing his face within inches of her vagina. His penis throbbing, aching, in need, he abruptly stepped back and shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;If sex and jerking off does lead me becoming a dog, it&#39;s not worth it to do either in an attempt to find out an answer,&quot; and pulling on his pants, he tried to distract himself.<br />
<br />
The wolf, as if sensing she wouldn&#39;t be fulfilled by him, whimpered, drew close and nipped at his pants leg, which also were taking on a dishevelled look. Shaking his head, he whispered, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t,&quot; and taking a step back, he added, &quot;I need to, I need,&quot; and finding his thoughts straying to wanting to satisfy the strong sexual urge that had come over him, to sate her in the most primal way, he shook his head. Breathing deeply, trying to clear his thoughts, he eventually managed to stutter, &quot;I ne-need to, get, get out, of-of, here,&quot; and turning away, he stumbled in a wildly erratic pattern in what he hoped was a way out of the woods.<br />
<br />
As he ran, he was consciously aware of the way the ground dug into his feet. Twigs, pine needles and other forest debris pressing into the soles of his feet, he welcomed it, as it allowed him a sharp, stinging focus, even as he felt his canine penis rubbing pleasantly against the inside of his pants. His thoughts straying back to what he thought was a clue as to what was happening, he listened as the two wolves easily followed him. Desperately wanting a way to test his ideas, but without giving himself fully over to the sexual desires and thus losing another part of his humanity, he was at a loss. Turning abruptly in a new direction, he suddenly skidded to a halt when he nearly ran into someone.<br />
<br />
His breath escaping him in gasps, he gazed at the person for a moment before finally wheezing out, &quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
