<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vicky stroked your neck and ears softly as she fitted the bridle over your head. Meanwhile you remained on edge as the spike of pleasure that her teasing had brought about gradually started to diminish. You felt hot and uncomfortable all over as the persistent need to have your vagina soothed remained at the forefront of your mind. <br />
<br />
These lustful thoughts continued to circle through your mind as Vicky led you out of the barn and out towards the yard. You focused on looking straight ahead as you clopped along, trying to ignore the stallions that were obviously checking you out as you passed. <br />
<br />
Sadly your body gave off a contradictory message as it wanted nothing more than to attract one of these handsome studs. You were embarrassed and ashamed as you felt your tail slowly rise, revealing the moist folds that lay beneath. Things then got worse when your vulva started to open and close rhythmically. You could feel your fluids frothing out between the winking lips of your sex and smearing the area around it with wetness. The most worrying part of this was that the stallions seemed to be enjoying the view to no end as they whinnied and curled their lips back in excitement.<br />
<br />
Upon noticing your discomfort and barely-contained arousal, Vicky didn’t hesitate to rub it in a bit more. “Well Princess you seem to have plenty of admirers. Seeing that cute little cunt of yours would be enough to get any stallion’s blood pumping!” You snorted in defiance as you slowly lowered your tail to modestly cover yourself. Vicky only chuckled when she saw this. “You make such an adorable filly Princess. The lust coursing through you is plain to see, stop pretending that you don’t want to give in to your desires.” You gave another trembling whinny of protest in response. However you knew that Vicky was ultimately right, you were starting to become desperate for the infernal heat to go away. You weren’t sure how much longer you could resist.<br />
<br />
Vicky continued to mock you until she brought you over to a group of three other horses, each of which was being led by an attendant. You instinctively did a quick anatomy check to make sure that there was no risk of being mated. To your relief you soon worked out that they were all females.<br />
<br />
“Good morning Vicky,” a male attendant piped up as you approached, “I see that you and Princess are getting along well.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes,” Vicky replied as she softly stroked and patted your neck, “she has character but she’s quite a wonderful animal. You should have seen the looks she was getting from some of the stallions just now!” You snorted and pulled against the lead rope in annoyance as the two attendants mocked you. However this only seemed to add to their amusement as they laughed dismissively.<br />
<br />
“Right then,” Vicky continued as she moved to address the group as a whole, “now that we’re all here I think we should get started. First let’s begin with some introductions. From left to right we have Samantha, Michelle, Christine and Princess.” You looked along the line of fillies as you matched the names to their faces.<br />
<br />
Standing beside you was a rusty brown horse who was apparently called Christine. She looked back at you and you could instantly detect a hint of sadness and despair in her large brown eyes. Beyond her stood Michelle; a grey-coloured horse who seemed to be much more positive about meeting her fellow herdmates. She whinnied at you in a friendly greeting as your name was called out, but you only gave a dismissive snort in response. Finally, Samantha seemed to be much less happy about her current situation. She was a large black mare with a piercing look etched across her face. The anger was plain to see in her eyes as she glared at Vicky with a burning hatred.<br />
<br />
“Now then, “Vicky continued, “you four beautiful girls make up MTF Group 1, or Men-Turned-Fillies in longhand. This means that tomorrow your transformations will be made permanent as you are mated by one of our stallions. You will then be sorted based on your performance and behaviour during training. I would highly recommend that you do as instructed, unless you want to end up as a simple foal factory at the local stud farm!”<br />
<br />
Vicky’s monologue drew mixed reactions from the other three horses. Immediately beside you, Christine kept her head low in what looked like despair. However, beside her Michelle’s ears perked up as she whinnied back to Vicky eagerly. You also couldn’t help noticing that she was wiggling her ass slightly, indicating that she was actually excited by the prospect of being fucked by a stallion. As for Samantha, she seemed to be further enraged by the woman’s words, causing her to stomp her hooves loudly as she whinnied and snorted in anger.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile you reckoned that it would be best to bite your lip and not give Vicky any reaction for her to feed off. It was sickening just how jovial the attendants were when talking about damning real human beings. What was even worse was that you knew that the other three fillies had all once been men like you. Michelle’s reaction in particular shook you to the core. Seeing this former-man seemingly looking forward to becoming a female horse forever was utterly horrifying.<br />
<br />
“OK girls,” Vicky resumed after soaking in her audience’s varied reactions, “I know that the prospect of permanently changing species and gender can be a daunting one. That is why for this lesson we are going to see what will happen to you tomorrow. You are going to watch another group of former-men transition from reluctant fillies into true mares. I think that by the end you will all be looking forward to the big day tomorrow!”<br />
<br />
The other three horses repeated many of their previous reactions to this news. Meanwhile you were starting to get worried. You could feel the heat in your loins bubbling just beneath the surface and getting ready to erupt like a volcano. You knew that watching a group of horses fucking would do nothing but increase the burning need inside you.<br />
<br />
“Right then girls,” Vicky said as she grabbed your lead rope, “let’s go and see what’s in store for you tomorrow...”</p>
