<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of my weekend was uneventful. I could have tested the ring on myself, but I was afraid of what might happen. My little sister found that her wardrobe had changed to suit her new body, but didn’t really have very many problems adjusting.<br />
	Monday morning I wished that it was a holiday for me the entire week and I stayed home until on Thursday, I was invited to a dance by my girlfriend. I got ready and met her at the School. We danced for a while but I got bored and left the floor. I made my way into a fairly empty corridor outside the dance room. Soon, my girlfriend walked out to meet me. “Hey, what’s wrong?” She asked me.<br />
	“Oh, nothing, really.” I noticed as I usually do, that her cleavage was hanging out of her dress and I forced myself to look away, for the moment. “I wish that everybody in this hall would leave and not comeback until I wish otherwise.” And with that, everybody in the hall had a sudden desire to go do something else.  “I wish that no one would come near the doors to see me and my girlfriend.” <br />
	“You know what?” I asked her.<br />
	“What?” she responded, curious.<br />
	“I wish that you would not notice anything that I do, but act as if nothing is wrong.” <br />
	“Hmm.” She responded, indifferently.<br />
	“Now I wish for you to gain 100 pounds and for your dress to change to fit.” Her body swelled up like a balloon until she weighed a good 225 pounds. It wasn’t very becoming of her, so I wished her back to 125 pounds. I looked at her cleavage again and reached my hands up to feel her breasts. They weren’t very big I realized, probably about a BB cup. “I wish that your breasts would grow three cup sizes.” They swelled up, until they were EE sized. “No, that’s too big.” “I wish you didn’t have breasts.” Then, just like that, her chest flattened, her dress sagging before squeezing up to cover her breast-less chest. I had a really bad stiffy right now, so I decided to fix that. “I wish that I didn’t have any reproductive organs.” Then my erection vanished. I ran my hand into my boxers and felt a smooth surface where my manhood should have been.<br />
          Then I realized that no matter what I looked at, man or woman, I was not aroused at all. “I wish that, even though I don’t have reproductive organs, I can still be aroused by everything that previously aroused me.”<br />
	Then the feeling came. It was odd, like a static flash in my mind, but I knew it was me being aroused at the situation. I could turn anyone into anything I wanted. “Maybe I should try it on myself.” “I wish that I had my male reproductive organs again.” Then they came back. “I wish that I would regress eight years.” I suddenly felt my body shrink rapidly as I regressed back into a ten year old boy. I realized that I had not wished my suit to change and I wished that I was not wearing anything. My clothes vanished and I saw my hairless, incredibly small penis and testicles.<br />
	“Wow, it worked.” I said.<br />
	“Hey Jake, if you don’t mind, I would like to dance. I invited you so that we could dance together.” She said, sounding agitated.<br />
	“I wish that you didn’t want to dance, but wait for me instead.” I said.<br />
	“Ha, just kidding.” She said, smiling, as if she was looking at a fully clothed 18 year old male, instead of a nude ten year old one. I continued with my wishes.<br />
	“I wish that I would regress another 6 years.” I shrank even more, turning into a four year old boy. I thought for a minute and came to a satisfying conclusion. “I wish I would regress even more into an unborn fetus at the age in which the sex is decided, then age back as a girl with all of my memories of my male self.” I began to shrink even more and I sat on the ground as I lost my ability to stand. My teeth pulled back into my gums and my hair began to thin out and get shorter. My eyes closed over and I felt my body getting smaller still, until I blacked out. When I came to, I was still a baby. I tried to sit up, but found I couldn’t, until a few seconds later when I was about 10 months out of the womb. <br />
	When I did sit up, I looked straight to my genitals to see it as I expected to; a baby girl’s genitalia. I realized that the ring had slipped off my finger. I located it and mentally wished that I would progress to the age of eighteen. When I reached 4 years of age, I stood up and slipped the ring to my finger, wishing that it would never come off again, no matter what I was turned into. As I reached the age of 11, I became fascinated with two bumps on my chest that increased in size at a steady rate. By the time I was 15, they were BB sized breasts. They only got bigger, though, as I got older, but not much. By the time I was eighteen, they had reached a pleasant 36 C size. I looked over the rest of myself and found that my pussy was quite hairy.   <br />
	“I wish I was wearing a dress that fits me.” A black Dress suddenly materializes over my body, but I realize that that is all I’m wearing. “I wish I was wearing pantie hose and black 1 &frac12; inch heels.” I looked at my girlfriend and said. “I wish you were my panties.” She disappeared and I found myself wearing panties. I pulled up the hem of my dress to find a pair of back silk panties. They were very comfortable. I decided that I didn’t need a bra and just went home. Before I reached my house, I made a wish that everyone thought I had been born a girl besides myself, even though I had memories of myself as a girl as well as a man. I also wished for my cloths to change into girl cloths that weren’t skanky, but not modest either.</p>
