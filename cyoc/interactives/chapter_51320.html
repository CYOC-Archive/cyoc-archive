<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So what about the other twelve officers?&quot; Brian asked calmly, &quot;Bobbi and the others?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about them?&quot; Gill asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll need them if we're to bring Jensen in,&quot; Felicity spoke, &quot;even if his pack has been debrainwashed... Serenity said they'd still likely be loyal to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of them are like the Smith family staff,&quot; Gill countered, &quot;they'd be there to continue the work they did before Jensen was transformed... and if Serenity's hunch is right, your &quot;transform&quot;, Mrs. Hardy, has likely changed Jensen for the better as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He still wants to expand his pack!&quot; Felicity gasped, &quot;He is EVERY BIT the monster he was before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He also said he'd limit his use of the game or his pups powers to those that were willing,&quot; Gill answered, &quot;Nothing illegal with that. Those that broke into your home will have to face justice for breaking into your home, and depending on whether or not Jensen's freed pack members press any criminal charges, Jensen could be facing some as well. Legally speaking if you can prove without a doubt that he planned the attack on your home, you might have something there, but I'd warn you, anything said vocally, outside of a confession... which many times as to be written down as well... I doubt there will be much in the way of evidence of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We most certainly want to press charges,&quot; Brian spoke firmly, &quot;especially since he molested Cassii. She'd always been a dear friend of Mary's. Felicity and I would be happy to raise her once she's away from that monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cassii's foster family doesn't live in Glendale,&quot; Gill answered, &quot;if they molested her, it wasn't Jensen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He still can't raise her in prison,&quot; Felicity pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no he can't,&quot; Gill sighed, &quot;but legally speaking, all Cassii can do is make a complaint. I can try to do what's best for her, but her case will involve a MOUNTAIN of red tape, which at present I do not have time for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do?&quot; Brian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, wait,&quot; Gill spoke, &quot;Jensen said he would return once he'd freed his pack. Now, depending on the wording of how he's done things, that could mean very soon, or it could mean longer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Longer?&quot; Mary asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;If what Bobbi has told me of what the blue, sky-blue wolf has said is true, Jensen might even be checking each pack member if they want to press charges and will simply then come here and take it,&quot; Gill spoke, &quot;it isn't the way we do things, and if he has Frank and Daryl, they should have told him this already... but a lot of times criminals that feel truly guilty don't do things buy our book. They seek to &quot;pay&quot; for the crimes and feel upset when the system slows them down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if he hasn't changed them back?&quot; Brian questioned, &quot;what if they're all still there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said before, most of them likely worked for the Smiths before their transformation,&quot; Gill answered, &quot;they'd probably still be there... as to whether or not Jensen has actually cured his pack of their brainwashing... that would be Serenity's department. She may decide to check on them... she may not. Given how bad her shoulder looks, and the injuries Paul has sustained, I'd doubt if either of them is very active for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could check and make sure,&quot; Felicity volunteered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be Serenity's call,&quot; Gill told them.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Outside, Trevor's thrashing slowly came to a stop. He was angry, mostly at himself. His thoughts dwelt on the day Queen died saving him... a death that was apparently unnecessary. He didn't really know what would have happened to him if Mr. P had caught him, but if he couldn't die, he'd likely be reconstituted somehow. It somewhat reminded him of Binks from Hocus Pocus, but that cat looked more like Judas then he did.<br />
<br />
It brought back all his guilt over Queen's death. It still surprised him to a great extent that the first &quot;person&quot; who had ever loved him was a house cat, and that he had spent much of his time trying to get away from her... and then in the end, she did something that he never thought possible. And it had been in vain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, Trevor,&quot; Cassii told him as she hugged him tightly, &quot;You looked down. I thought it would cheer you up...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Real cheery,&quot; Trevor grumbled, &quot;This isn't fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Cassii sighed, &quot;but sometimes life just isn't fair. If it was, I could still run with Cindii.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She can move can't she?&quot; Trevor wondered weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but it's not the same,&quot; Cassii told the tabby, &quot;but we must all move on. We can't stay stuck in the past.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor didn't answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like nothing more then to have my family back in a form in which we can be a family, but Rachel couldn't escape the dare she was under, and after getting to know her, I had to forgive her,&quot; Cassii spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rachel spoke to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome, Rachel,&quot; Cassii told her locket.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a new life to live now,&quot; Cassii then continued, &quot;and I hope to be happy with my new &quot;sisters&quot; and pack mates. To have a new family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're staying at the Smiths?!&quot; Trevor gasped, looking stronger, &quot;where Jensen is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he's free of the Curse's original control set... he'll be a male wolf forever more, but he isn't the &quot;Big Bad Wolf&quot; anymore,&quot; Cassii told him, &quot;I'll be home with him in my other forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can become a glass wolf pup at any time, and two nights every month I turn into an adult she wolf,&quot; Cassii told him, &quot;it was part of the terms Cindii put on me. And I willingly accepted it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor only gave a sigh and laid his head to rest against Cassii's stomach. As he quieted down, Serenity approached again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything else you wanted, Cassii?&quot; Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly some contact,&quot; Cassii spoke, &quot;Jensen doesn't want a war between his pack and the Hardy's pride. He has asked me, Abbey, Samantha, and Ulysses to be diplomats to you and the pride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To both of us?&quot; Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jensen doesn't want to lose his pack... his family,&quot; Cassii spoke, &quot;Abbey, Samantha, and I can move just about anywhere through the mirrorverse, and all of us knew Mary before she was transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Serenity commented, &quot;I don't think Brian or Felicity will take kindly to negotiating with children and to be honest, my goal in this case was to break up this pack. Free the victims. Let them live THEIR lives and follow their hopes and dreams.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are free to do that,&quot; Cassii told the older woman, &quot;but they've also chosen to stay with their pack. They are a family, now, Madame Serenity. Making them split up could hurt more then transforming them did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity only sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd need to see that,&quot; Serenity spoke, &quot;the wolves would all need to contact their former families and get permission from them to remain at the Smith manor. If any of them are transformed teenagers, it is not up to Jensen or even them, but to their parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But not all parents are good,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't matter,&quot; Serenity spoke, &quot;If any of his pack are under the age eighteen, and do not have a legal reason to be at the Smith estate every day all day, such as either consent, permission, or their parents are already part of this pack and are there... they need to return to their biological families, where they belong. When they turn eighteen they can return to the pack if they wish... but not before. If their biological parents are abusive or poorly behaved, they then fall into the hands of the state or can legally claim to be independent if they're over sixteen. Those are the rules of society Cassii. And we must all live by them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassii only looked down for a moment but didn't say anything.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Does this still make us brothers?&quot; Kevin tentatively asked Bart as he sat on the floor while Bart only looked out the window. Jenny and Marcy sat on the bed behind him while Zelipe and Amy had gone up to the study with Mr. P and Martha to read.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it does,&quot; Bart sighed, &quot;all of us, except Jenny, have similarly colored fur...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like mother's,&quot; Marcy spoke slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only because of the game,&quot; Kevin sighed, &quot;Kaylee made us her children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Marcy nodded, &quot;but she still loves us. That hasn't changed. Maybe she's learned from us on how to be a mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean learned from me... even though I no longer match that gender,&quot; Kevin sighed, &quot;oh, this is all confusing. I want to chase rabbits and at the same time I want to mourn what I've lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We all do,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;but I don't think we can really escape it. Jensen and Kaylee are our parents now. All we can do is hope they don't repeat our mistakes. Maybe they'll be good parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't be worse then we were,&quot; Bart sighed, &quot;We ignored Jennifer much of her life... and when we did interact with her, she was always a little kid. I checked our old family photo albums, Jenny. Martha or someone else from the staff were in more photos with Jennifer then we were. I'm angry that Jensen did this to us, but part of me is angry because we may have deserved it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad and mom will do better,&quot; Marcy told the older red-brown male pup, &quot;They will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We intend to try,&quot; came Kaylee's voice from the doorway.<br />
<br />
All four heads turned to the red-brown she-wolf at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kevin, Marcy, I'm... I'm...&quot; Kaylee began, &quot;I'm sorry. I know you loved me as my parents, and it was wrong to do what I did, to turn you into pups... but, I couldn't help myself. I promise to try to be as good as you were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling Kaylee's presence somehow gave the four some relief, and her obvious guilt made them rush to her, hugging her legs and waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright, Mommy,&quot; Marcy told her, &quot;It's alright.&quot;</p>
