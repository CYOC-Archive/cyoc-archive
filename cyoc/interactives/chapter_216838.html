<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Kat threw Dan’s empty skin onto her bed and opened her spell book to look over the spells she needed. The spells she needed had to change the texture of dan’s skin, from flesh to nylon, then it had to compress the excess parts of his skin into the parts that will become her now pantyhose.<br />
When she was done reviewing the needed spells, she closed the book, took up her wand, and began weaving the spell. As the first spell was being cast her wand began glowing a bright purple, which carried over to Dan.<br />
Dan was stuck lying there, the lead that previously permeated his body was now gone, yet even with it gone he still couldn’t move, his muscles where gone and he was utterly helpless against Kat and her wands mysterious purple spell.<br />
<br />
Kat finished weaving her first spell and kept a close eye on Dan’s extremities to see which would start turning first. This close observation proved fruitful when she caught sight of one of his toes darkening, and when she felt it, she was happy not to feel the texture of skin, but nylon. She watched as the nylon weaved together all of his toes together into one mass at the end of his feet.<br />
As the nylon continued to replace his skin already creeping up his feet and reaching his ankles, Kat stepped into her walk-in closet to prepare an outfit to wear with Dan on her birthday party.<br />
The nylon had reached his knees by the time Kat had decided on a skirt to wear that would look good with Dan, now to find a matching top.<br />
It had just about reached his hips when Kat stepped out of the closet, good she hadn’t missed the second part of her newest favorite memory as the nylon crawled up and over his hips, Dans flattened groin was being turned into nylon, she considered taunting dan about it but thought it would be better to never let him know, after all, what is more embarrassing and scary than what your own mind comes up with. Better to let Dan imagine what did, is, and will be happening to his groin.<br />
With her fun over, Kat turned around back into the closet to continue looking for a proper outfit, while Dan continued to become nylon.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, no… no, no no, hmm what about this one” Kat said, pulling out a nice top, “it would work, but it’s pretty thin, I’ll need a sweater over top since it’s getting cold outside.” Kat decided, with a nod of her head, she brought the top and skirt out and laid the skirt onto her bed next to Dan. Checking on him showed that his entire torso was coated in nylon, and while it seemed to have stopped at the neck, it was just getting Dan’s arms first before finishing with his head. “Almost done Dan, I better hurry up or I’ll be waiting on YOU to be done before we go out.” While Dan couldn’t give an annoyed, mad, or even a scared expression towards Kat, she safely assumed that one of those were what he was trying to give her when his eyes looked at her.<br />
Back in her closet, Kat didn’t have to search long for a sweater, she only had a few, and only one that she really loved so it was an easy choice. The final part of her outfit that she knew would take the longest and would probably leave Dan waiting on her, but he can wait, what’s he gonna do, yell at her?<br />
As Kat stepped over to her shoe section, Dan’s new nylon skin was only halfway to his elbow’s, and as it crept down his arms, Dan contemplated what he had done to deserve this. Sure, he messed with his sister, but what younger brother didn’t, and it wasn’t like he was nasty to her with his pranks, they were almost always something that even he as a kid could fix. He never intentionally harmed her, never badmouthed her, he never even talked badly about her friends, hell, he even considers one of Kat’s friends one of his own friends. Was it because he was falling behind in school, but why would she care? Sure, she had already graduated from high school, and with flying colors to boot, but getting on his back for school should be his parent’s job, not Her’s! He just couldn’t wrap his head around it that his arms had already been consumed by the nylon, his hands coated the stuff, the five fingers on each hand replicated his toes, becoming a single mass, and now the nylon was creeping up his neck.<br />
It crawled up his neck and made contact with his chin, he was so wrapped up in his own mind that he didn’t feel it creeping up his hollowed out and flat head. The nylon made contact with his mouth and crept up and over, not even bothering to give details to his mouth. On the back on his head the nylon meets his hair, which was eaten and absorbed into the nylon, if his head wasn’t deflated then he would have looked bald by the time the nylon reached the top of his head. But that is yet to happen, instead your head is being smoothed over in nylon, your ears, just flaps of skin on the side of your head, were smother over, your nose, also just an awkward flap of skin on the front of your face, now nothing more than a patch on nylon in front of your face. Throughout all of this you had been to caught up in your mind that you didn’t notice any of it, but now your eyes where next in the path of the nylon, and when they crept over and replaced the flesh in your face with nylon your sight stayed, but it was like looking through a mesh. This change finally snapped Dan back into reality and out of dwelling on his past.<br />
Dan laid on the bed waiting for Kat as the last of his flesh and hair was consumed by the nylon, without a clock he didn’t really know how long he was waiting, but Kat eventually came out of her walk-in with a pair of flats that would look good with Dan. As she set the shoes next to her change of clothes, she took a good look at Dan, smirked and said, “wow Dan, you’re looking good, in fact, I think it’s an improvement.”<br />
Now that Dan was hollowed out, and his skin was replaced with nylon, it was time for the last spell for Dan. Taking out her wand again she casts the spell, which glows a bright yellow.<br />
Dan felt the effect immediately, as his arms and his head felt like they were being pulled into his chest, while his chest was caving into his pelvis. His perspective was very disorienting, it felt like his eyes were moving down his body, even after his head was fully absorbed into his pelvis, all the way down towards his groin. With the upper half of his body now a part of his hollow pelvis and legs, the top of his pelvis opened to allow someone to wear him. Kat picked him up and looked him over, checking the quality of his transformation, “Perfect,” she declared “you’ll be perfect for my birthday party, thanks again Dan, this is the best gift you’ve ever gotten me, actually, you’re the only gift you’ve given me.”<br />
Dan was in shock, he wasn’t dumb, he may not have been told what it was he was turned into, but he’d seen his mother wearing something similar. His sister had turned him into pantyhose!</p>
