<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The math teacher described in this story is inspired by a real-life one I had in high-school. Excluding the fact she was a woman, everything is the same. Her presence being exceptional (and usually not before 9h30 A.M.), her uncanny ability to make anyone ‘unlearn’ math, or the fact she blamed us for not being farther in the teaching plan. (I won&#39;t pretend she was sole responsible, but she clearly had her part in it. Didn&#39;t stop her from denying it.)<br/>
<br/>
That said, she never divided our notes. At the same time, reporting her to administration never did anything. (Not that they didn&#39;t care, they just couldn&#39;t do anything. But again, French public school is different from U.S. public school.)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time Monday rolled out, which mean being back to class, I had convinced myself all this thing with the fairy was nothing but a strange dream. <em>There is no such thing as a fairy outside of fairies tales and other fantasy, after all</em>.<br />
<br />
I was on the way to my first class of the day when, at a corner, I bumped into someone. She had been just beyond said corner, which had hidden her from me, and she was transporting a huge pile of documents, preventing her from seeing what was in front of her. &quot;Sorry, sorry!&quot; she immediately, bowing in front of me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s my fault&quot; I said &quot;I didn&#39;t look were I was going. Let me help you pick up all those documents,&quot; I added, without waiting for her answer to start collecting the scattered papers.<br />
<br />
The girl I had rammed in was Alice DeFlames, one of three identical triplets sharing my homeroom. Of the 3, Alice is clearly the studious one, known as the best student the school ever had, with top grades in every intellectual subject. One would think it would make her popular among teachers, but they won&#39;t love one so good they surpass them on their favored subject. Because of this they use her as their errant-girl and, being a meek little nerd, Alice never got the courage to say ‘no’ to her teachers.<br />
<br />
Physically, she&#39;s more plump than her sisters, but not to the point you could reasonably call her fat. That said, I only know it because I saw her in the school&#39;s P.E. uniform. Most of the time she hide her shape in baggy clothes, which is a shame if you ask me, she is cute as hell. That said, I can understand it, with how much boys leer at her impressive rack and wide hips. (That and lack of self-esteem caused by jealous girls and mocking jock calling her fat.) She has long red-hairs she usually put in a bun (except in P.E, where she tie them in a high pony-tail, instead) is rather fair-skinned, with freckles on her cheeks who seem to underline her thick-rimmed glaces, themselves hiding her soulful but usually sad greed eyes.<br />
<br />
As we were collecting the strewn papers, I asked &quot;Aren&#39;t you usually helped by your sister? The sporty one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and she usually berate me for accepting the task all the way to class. But today Lou couldn&#39;t accompany me, she was summoned by the principal. Apparently she screamed at her math teacher before punching him in the face. What came over her?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that… The thing with Mr ‘Eraser’. I can explain it, we have the same math class. Imagine having a math teacher that&#39;s always half an hour tardy for their 9 A.M. lesson <strong>when he&#39;s here</strong>, which is pretty rare. Then add to it the fact said teacher is so bad at his job that after each lesson we understand math <strong>less</strong> than we did before. I swear that guy could make Thales and Pythagoras unable to understand their own theorem!<br />
Anyway, yesterday Eraser beat his own record and was half an hour tardy for our 10 A.M. lesson, and thought it a good idea to blame us for how far behind we are on the lesson plans. We all snapped. Seriously, he should be happy your sister was the faster one, or it wouldn&#39;t have stopped at a fist to his face.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you report him to the school&#39;s administration, if he&#39;s so late and rarely here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did. At best we weren&#39;t believed. The worst was when we were, since it meant we got all our already disastrous grades divided by 2 in the next test.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh…&quot; She posed a moment before adding &quot;I could help you. Well… If you want, that is. I&#39;ve heard I&#39;m rather good at explaining things! Well, at least that&#39;s what Steph&#39; say, but only behind closed doors. You know how she is at school, say interacting more than necessary with peoples like us would damage her image.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie DeFlames being Alice&#39;s other sister. Being a teen actress, her career make her often miss part of the day, when not all of it. It also place her on the top of our school social ladder, and take it as a permit to be a jerk to everyone outside of her little ‘elite’ circle, even her own siblings.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll gladly accept your math tutoring, but we&#39;ll have to discuss when it can happen later or we&#39;ll be late for class. In the meantime, let me help you with those papers. It&#39;s the least I can do.&quot; Accepting her lessons caused Alice to blush. And my offer to help transport her pile of documents only made that blush stronger.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t realize that little exchange had started a process that would slowly turn Alice into a succubus, and the first member of my harem. Nor that the end of our little exchange had been observed by Louise DeFlames, who was quite wary of my intentions.</p>
