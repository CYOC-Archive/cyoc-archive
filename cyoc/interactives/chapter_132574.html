<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">rolling out to your first delivery address as took you about two hours to get there. once at the place that you began to slip off the helmet as it had cat like ears on it, after shutting off the engine which came first. dismounting the motorbike as you still wish you had your manhood that your feminine groin was feeling a bit worm while your furry legs were making it rub against one another.<br />
<br />
feeling pressure as it was like going to the bathroom to check  things out with it that the clerk did said something was suppose to happen in three hours while in suit. heading over by foot with the package that you were about to ring the door bell when someone suddenly opened the door. if you were still a normal every day male self that you could say she was very cute teen in a maid outfit of here own.<br />
<br />
handing her the papers to sign as she was a bit shy for one that she was accompanied by someone. once the papers were signed as you handed her the package that the person with her was wearing a butler uniform, but also was wearing what appears to be a doberman suit. he must of gotten it from the same shop as the doberman butler helped her in the house while also stepping out to talk to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see your working as a deliver for the shop there now. if that&#39;s true then the shop owner has also told you about the good chance you&#39;ll be dragged deep into anyone&#39;s lair that if this should happen, then they are agreeing to pay extra for your time of serves when they sign for the item he or she orders. there are even thoughs who didn&#39;t order from your shop, but still want the use of you, dose that sounds it up on what your job is while doing your deliveries?&quot; he said as a pinch of fear told you something about him was giving off a bad feeling that you back up, but only a bit as he looked left and right to see if any one was ever looking or listening.<br />
<br />
taking steps closer till his snout was near you lion ears, while also secretly handing a piece of paper. &quot;listen, i had a basketball player call me as he was injured. he called the shop, saying the I know someone that could fill in his place till his injuries were feeling a lot better. take this note and show it to your boss. (this is where he steps back to where he was once standing) after all, the customer&#39;s always come first.&quot; he said as he then wave bye to you while entering the house.<br />
<br />
before he did that you gave him your job card for who you work for as there were more you were holding for your deliveries. now your chore on delivering the package was done that you figured it was time to head back to the shop. mounting back on you motorbike as you then slipped on the helmet again that you soon started the engine and was rolling back to the shop, but it was an hour later when you stop at the gas station as thing were getting out of hand.<br />
<br />
as you were in one of the bathroom stalls that you felt out of breath while doing you business, trying to relief yourself. taking about 15 minutes of a bathroom break that you didn&#39;t want to say, or even thing about what you have done in there as you were in a female lion suit in the female&#39;s bathroom stall. grabbing a few thing to go while getting gas for the bike that it was another hour before returning back to the shop, the only thing about it were the cops were there too.<br />
<br />
parking the bike in the back with the other things, like the helmet that once inside is where two cops with a missing flyer were talking to the shop owner. one of them sees you and approaches you while asking the same questions, but when the cop showed you the flyer that the pitcher was none other then the girl you just delivered the package to. seeing as they were not looking for a reason to get in trouble with the law on ether side that the shop building itself made the flyer page itself look like a skunkett you were just wearing hours ago as the cops were stun a bit and soon left.<br />
<br />
not realizing what just happen, a phone rings that the owner picked it up to answer who it was while giving the piece of paper to your boss. taking off the mail uniform off as the boss quickly snaps the fingers at you while on the phone that it must be the coach the doberman butler was talking about. putting the box away that you listen in on what they were sawing.<br />
<br />
&quot;sure i&#39;ll get him ready in time for the basketball game, but he&#39;ll look more like an animal then a human player. is that ok with you coach? ok, mm hmm, yes you do owe me as it counts to $12,000, mmm hmmm, a bet i&#39;m listening, aright and should you loss, sounds fair. so just to sound this up, if your team wins all the way up to the champion game that you&#39;ll use the money to pay off your det, but should you loss and not make it that you&#39;ll willing to be dressed up in one of my animal suits and be ship off to who knows where for money? alright then. you just got yourself a dangerous bet. hope you win, bye.&quot; the owner soon hangs up and heads to the ale of sports, but it was mostly empty that the boss soon pulls out a box with a lable of a croc man wearing a uniform on and hands it to you. <br />
<br />
before you could ask about the coach&#39;s det and bet the with a snap, you were the crocodile man in a basketball uniform. taking you up stairs that it was a gym court for basketball as the owner wanted you to train till tonight&#39;s game. once the boss had left as you had a strange urge again that doing some training, practicing with the ball while doing some drills seems to calm the urge as you did this for hours, till the owner of the shop came back with the coach.<br />
<br />
when they called you over that you tossed the ball in the air while heading over to them as it made a slam dunking score out of it, a backwards toss score. seeing as the coach was timid of you new form while you were practicing on getting use to new self that he seemed like a good guy. they tolled you one thing as you left the shop and on the bus filled with your fellow team players, it was time.</p>
