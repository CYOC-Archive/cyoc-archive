<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Without thinking you changed it to &quot;a powerful man is reverting you while using the change app”.<br />
<br />
You looked up and breathed a sigh of relief. The same heavy build man was still typing away from his phone, and as you looked down to your renewed male body, you couldn’t help but feel secure in your maleness again. You flexed your arms, kissing the bulging baseball, no, melon sized masses of biceps as you recalled that being a man was exactly what you wanted. Of course, they were generous, but nothing compared to the man, you thought to yourself. You flared your lats and posed, noting the man checking out your broadening mass as you huffed. <br />
<br />
Man, it felt good being huge. Even &quot;little&quot; you throbbed in joy.<br />
<br />
...Wait a minute.<br />
<br />
The muscular man had dropped his sunglasses down, letting you catch a glimpse of the blue eyes that scanned your form up and down. He had licked his lips, agreeing with your change, before tapping again on his phone, blue drawstring poser straining to contain him. He was blonde, with a heavy tan that left you nearly jealous.<br />
<br />
Yet that jealousy was quickly cooling as you felt yourself wrapped up in recognizing <I>something</I> was amiss. But what could be?<br />
<br />
You were one of the headliners in the Muscle Beach Bodybuilding contest, and as you looked around, you found your competition eagerly training or oiling each other up to maintain dominance for the win. All save you, and, the same man who was getting up and strutting over to you amidst the Adonises who were busily changing or stripping. He parted the muscle bound men like a god as he came to you, smirking with a cocky grin as he placed a heavy hand on your biceps. You felt your cheeks grow rosier, he nodded, and you flexed a most muscular to his delight.<br />
<br />
“Not bad.”<br />
<br />
You quickly tensed your biceps as you stomped your leg down and kneeled into a crouch.<br />
<br />
“Thanks.”&#8232;<br />
<br />
The timbre in your voice gently reminded you how wonderful it felt being “you” again, as if all was well. The smoothness, the way men were eyeing your muscular form, wanting to <I>be</I> you. It felt right.<br />
<br />
The man looked at his phone again and you felt your jealousy rising again before he looked across to you again, you smirked hoping to catch his attention.<br />
<br />
“So, you had an app too, right?”<br />
<br />
He asks, in a casual tone. Normally you could tell when someone was trying to be sly, but for some reason you felt yourself enamored by him.<br />
<br />
“Sure I do, can’t recall too much, but, I was using it on my partner before.” <br />
<br />
You smirked. You got up, dropping your hands down to your cinched waist as you dug into the black posers, cock growing at the attention. You remembered you still had your phone in your hand, though, your priority was on your rival.<br />
<br />
He grinned, tapping on his phone again.<br />
<br />
“Thought so, he’s absolutely massive, but pretty small compared to you.” He laughed.<br />
<br />
You looked at him quizzically.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about? I’m practically the biggest guy on the beach here.” You responded, almost in a whining tone.<br />
<br />
The man chuckled, stepping forward to lay his hands and groped your pecs.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I can imagine big guy, say, how much you weigh again? For old time’s sake?” He asked.<br />
<br />
Somehow you could feel the answer bubbling in your head as his fingers tweaked at your nipples, your jaw cracking as you nearly moaned aloud.<br />
<br />
“320… Pounds?”<br />
<br />
The blonde man nodded, hefting your pecs and watching them bounce, your black poser stretching to contain you as you were being attended to so lavishly.<br />
<br />
“Thought so.”&#8232;&#8232;He turned away, and you lowered your gaze despondently, only to perk your ears up as he spoke.<br />
<br />
“Looks like your guy knows how to work a crowd…” He said, causing you to gawk to the direction he was pointing at.<br />
<br />
You licked your lips as you watched Thomas, the muscle bull in all his glory being serviced and servicing the fellow bodybuilders on the beach. Despite being Korean, you recalled, such a sight was normal as Thomas had made news for being considered the Asian hulk before you two had met at the local gym before your last show. His large, plump pecs were being motorboated by a dark-skinned man you vaguely found familiar, dressed in a skimpy poser and boots with a cropped blue shirt and a police cap. Thomas showed his appreciation for the “officer’s” service to the men of the beach by licking his baton, before gulping it down with glee.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a tanned man who looked fresh out of Baywatch was rubbing his cock on Thomas’ glutes, the surfer having tugged Thomas’ chained poser to make room in case he thrusted in. Men of all kinds and sizes, all in various colors and patterns of skimpy underwear hooted as they wanted to take part and be serviced by Thomas, the Beast from the East. You felt a tinge of pride as you saw your partner enjoy himself as he had just started getting his roid gut in control.<br />
<br />
You looked back to the Adonis and felt your dick twitch as he was possibly just as large, maybe even larger than you. He had simply been smiling and typing away on his phone, and not realizing you were still next to him. Your eyes looked down and noticed a familiar interface as a sentence had generated:<br />
<br />
“The men’s bodybuilding contest started off with an orgy.”<br />
<br />
Then it hit you, you looked down and saw what was supposed to be your phone was a bottle of oil meant to help yourself get ready for the contest. You looked over, to where the man was laying down gazing upon you and noticed your phone laid innocently face down in the same generic case you had for yourself.<br />
<br />
You looked at the man, then Thomas, and then your phone again.</p>
