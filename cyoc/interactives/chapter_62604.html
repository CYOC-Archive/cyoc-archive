<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The fairies slipped into the forest, giggling as they revealed their new forms once again, their wands appearing suddenly in their hands the moment they thought of them, and began practicing their magic. As Amy flicked her wand once, a tree nearby began to split, but not in a way one would expect... it was almost like a change of space, the doorway to another realm opening. As the world on the other side came into being, they saw a mountainous snow covered landscape, with a massive fortress looming before them, by all appearances abandoned for millenia. Lina initially drew away, but Amy felt entranced by the palace, something was compelling her to pass through the gateway, and she quietly spread her wings, fluttering through the portal. Immediately the harsh, bitter cold swam through her, making her gasp at the sudden temperature change, and she immediately landed, wrapping her arms around her body trying to maintain the warmth. But something was different, the cold seemed to not only pierce her skin, but her soul, it felt like it was soaking into her, and to her surprise, she began to feel more comfortable in the environnment around her. <br />
<br />
 Lina had followed Amy through the portal, the cold also effecting her, however the cold still felt bitter to her, and her eyes grew wide as she saw Amy begin to glow in the darkness, a pale, white light surrounding her friend. Amy gasped as pain began to wrack through her body, and everything about her seemed to shift, the clod again spreading through her as she grew again, reaching 5'5&quot; as her hips began to swell, followed by her breasts, which reached a full and firm D cup, her muscles toned, enhancing her natural curves even further as her legs lengthened, her lips grew fuller, and her waist thinned as her wings retracted into her body. Amy's clothes began to change, becoming a white silken gown that revealed her cleavage and new Goddessl ike figure perfectly as her hair lengthened, growing full as it too turned stark cold white. The pain began to subside as Amy's eyes shifted, becoming icy blue with feline like pupils. The aura around her transformed into something that commanded obedience, but would also threaten to lure any being that saw her into becoming entrance, and easily manipulated. With a soft, incredibly effeminate gasp, Amy looked down at her new form, feeling her body surge with more power then even some lower level gods, and turned to Lina, her perfect lips parting in a cold smile as she reached out, sending a lesser amount of power into her friend, who immediately fell to the ground, groaning in pain as her body underwent a similar change, taking on an appearance that very much resembled Amy's new form, but seemed much younger, closer to seventeen, in contrast to Amy's more adult appearance. But bother had become the epitome of beauty, and any man who laid eyes on them unprepared would immediately fall for them. As Amy studied her new appearance, knowledge began making its way into her thoughts, millions of years worth of knowledge, and she realized she had become one of the 6 Sidhe Queens, the Queen of the Winter court, and Lina had become her daughter, the Winter Lady. Many many centuries ago, the magical realm had died away, but certain magic shops had been placed around the world in an effort to reintroduce these worlds. In becoming Faeries, Amy had inadvertently taken on the task of recreating the faerie realm, however when it came to such matter as the Sidhe, who would heavily effect the balance of nature in the world their once humans selves had come from, they would need a counter balance, the Summer Court of the Sidhe, together they would balance each other out, but the Summer court would have to act quickly. <br />
<br />
 While the two courts, would normally be at the very best tolerant with each other, during the reintroduction, both would have to make sacrifices to ensure the continuation of life. However, as of now, there was only one court. But as the new Queen thought to herself, she thought of the perfect person to become the new Summer Queen, all she would need to do is lure said person into the realm of the Faerie to begin their transformation into the Summer Queen. Slowly, a cold smile crept over her lips as she waved a hand, dismissing the doorway before she began the journey into what would become the summer realm,for perhaps her first and only time, in preparation to summon the chosen human. Meanwhile, in the human realm, a young man named Matthew sat quietly at his computer, bored, tired, depressed, he had spent several years trying to deal with lifes twists and turns, but over time, he had found himself growing tired of it all, more than once he had contemplated suicide, but had never been able to go through with it. His imagination was often his greatest tool, and he put it to use frequently but nothing would prepare him for how his life was about to change. Suddenly, his computer went black, as sparks sputtered from the machine, a small trail of smoke filling the air, its scent consuming his nostrils. However, a few moments, later, something seemed to push the scent away, and suddenly his nostrils picked up the scent of flowers, fresh grass, and the sound of rushing water filled his ears as her felt a warm gust of air behind him, and he quietly turned, looking behind him in surprise.....</p>
