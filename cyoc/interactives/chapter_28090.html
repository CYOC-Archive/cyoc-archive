<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Billy looked down at the tiny woman who had only moments ago been bullying him as an overgrown 6th grade boy. For a moment, Billy's compassionate side considered helping her. Then, he thought back on all the times that Jake had pushed him around and stolen his money, all of the pain and fear he had put Billy through. No, he thought. It's time for payback.<br />
<br />
He pushed his glasses back into position on his nose. Then, he smiled and stepped forward towards the doll woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well,&quot; he said. &quot;Look who's the bigger one now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacqueline (the former Jake) stared up at him in fear. To her, 10-year-old Billy was now a giant, seemingly 30 feet tall compared to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Billy, please change me back,&quot; Jacqueline said. She looked ready to cry. &quot;It was a mistake. I shouldn't have been so mean to you. I've learned my lesson, really. Please don't leave me like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy chuckled to himself. This was too perfect. The former bully seemed so pathetic and scared now as a little doll woman. She'd been reduced to nothing but a little girl's plaything. Although he didn't know how it had happened, it seemed that the universe had granted him justice.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I won't change you back,&quot; Billy said, bluffing. Even if he had wanted to, he couldn't have changed her at all.<br />
<br />
He reached down his right hand and picked up Jacqueline by the waist. She was heavier than he had expected her to be. Billy remembered that, when he had held one of his little sister's Barbie's, it had been much lighter. He figured that the difference in weight was because, instead of plastic, he was now holding a real flesh and blood woman.<br />
<br />
Little Jacqueline was terrified to be held in Billy's giant hand. At the same time, it was so humiliating, to be only a doll wrapped in the hand of a 10-year-old boy. To her embarrassment, she also noticed part of herself enjoying the pleasant sensual feeling of Billy's huge thumb as it pressed up against the bottom of her massive breasts through her bathing suit. Billy smiled at her, showing his teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don't want me to make you any smaller, then you will do exactly as I say,&quot; said Billy. Again, he was bluffing as best as he could. He had no idea what had transformed her, although he was reasonably sure he wasn't the one who had done it. The smiled faded from his face. &quot;Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacqueline nodded. She looked too frightened to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to put you in my pocket, and you are going to keep completely quiet and still while you are in there. Or else...&quot; He smiled his most wicked smile. &quot;...I'll feed you to my cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her face paled as her eyes went wide. If Jacqueline had been frightened before, she was terrified now. At this point, she would do anything Billy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you understand me.&quot; said Billy. &quot;Good, were leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
He opened a Velcro leg pocket on his cargo pants, and carefully slipped Jacqueline into it. It was a deep pocket, but she still had to sit down to fit her whole body in it. As she sat there, hugging her knees and trying to pretend that this wasn't really happening, Billy pressed shut the Velcro, trapping her inside. Again, he smiled to himself and thought about all the fun ways he could torture the little doll woman. He decided it was time to go home to get his payback.<br />
<br />
Carrie watched this all from her bench with a contented grin on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't children wonderful?&quot; she said to Todd as she petted him once more. &quot;Their capacity for cruelty is so surprisingly deep. I suppose it's just human nature after all. I mean, look at me for example. I was just some ordinary college student. I never broke the rules or tried to hurt anyone else. I was a model citizen, a good girl. Then, you came along and put this incredible power in my hand. Now, look at me. Look at what I've become. I've never been so cruel, but, at the same time, I've never felt so alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled and watched as Billy walked off, smiling himself as he brushed his hand over the large lump in his leg pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;I almost feel sorry for that poor little thing,&quot; Carrie said. Then, she thought about it for a moment as Billy and his plaything left the park. &quot;Nah, screw him. He's going to get what he deserves. I only wish I could watch it happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took another sip from her drink and began her search for a new victim.</p>
