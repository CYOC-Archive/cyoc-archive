Despite Freed&#39;s now 7 foot height, he had never felt smaller than he did now standing before the library&#39;s large wooden double doors. He really did not want to face the librarian, if anything he wished he could just knock leave the Scroll and run. But he couldn&#39;t,  he knew he had to set it right.<br />
<br />
Slowly he opened the door and stepped through into the high domed central room. No one else seemed to be in the library at the time.<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Freed called out, hoping Ms. Char would come to him, he stepped inside and closed the door behind him and walked toward the restricted section, a portion of the library sealed off for all but professors, 9th and up year students, and those with special permission. Freed was none of those. As he reached the gates he pushed experimentally on them and surprise, it was unlocked. Freed continued in and found the scroll&#39;s place on the shelf and quickly replaced it. He ran out of the restricted section and after clearing the gate felt a weight slam into him, pushing his back against a shelf. His wings were painfully being pressed between his back and the shelf behind him. <br />
<br />
Freed opened his eyes to see the librarian looking down at him. Ms.Char had one of her upper claws pining him to the shelf with her body weight, the other 3 supporting her massive dragon half and her 2 human limbs placed on her hips. Ms.Char was a beautiful lady from the waist up with large sized breasts at least D-cup in size that she only kept covered with a string bikini top as dragontaurs abored clothing and only wore the top as a request from the headmaster.<br />
She leaned in close, her claw pressing into Freed&#39;s robe &quot;no running in the library.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ow, ok ok ok, I deserve that. I&#39;m sorry Ms.Char. I was just putting it back.&quot;<br />
&quot;You are going to pay me back for stealing from my horde. You know how dragons feel when you take without permission.&quot;<br />
There was something in her voice that was different from all the other times he had interacted with her, but he couldn&#39;t place it.<br />
&quot;W-what do you mean? I could help out some around the library and work off my debt-&quot; one human had slammed into the shelf next to his head.<br />
&quot;Not good enough, I need something MORE.&quot; There it was again, the way she said it. Ms.Char was giving him a mischievous grin, leaning in a little more, letting a small puff of smoke billow out between her teeth. &quot;A girl has needs, and I&#39;m a big girl, so I&#39;ve got big needs.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wah?&quot; Freed looked at her is bewilderment then shocked understanding as he saw her move her other hand behind her back and undo the lower knot. Ms.Char let her forked toung sexily lick her lips as she undid the top knot, letting her top fall to the ground and expose her perky round breasts. She moved one hand down to clutch one and massage it slowly.<br />
&quot;You know, word travels fast here, and I hear things. Things like how someone became a man a few nights ago.&quot;<br />
The entire time this exchange was happening Freed was mentally thinking about every unsexy thing he could think of in an attempt to not get aroused because once he did there would be no hiding it.<br />
&quot;I also heard you pack quite the package. Something that could really &#39;fill my needs&#39;.&quot; She brought her free hand down to undo his robe knot. Freed tried to struggle free, but was met with an increase in pressure. <br />
&quot;Ms.Char, you&#39;re hurting me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll feel great in a bit.&quot; She placed one foreclaw on his arm and the other rest on the floor and let the knot loose. Open came his robe as the knot was undone, exposing his baggy knee length sweat pants and bare chest. He had no shirt to cover his taller body and this was his only pants he could wear. He was losing the mental battle and he knew it, his twin members awakening and he could feel them slowly emerging from the sheath. Her free human hand hovered over his semidefined hairless pecs and moved down to his crotch. Freed&#39;s twins pushed past his waistband, the flat heads flaring out in all their bovine glory. Not wanting to wait, she grabbed the left one and both felt an electric shock flow through them. Freed took his chance and punched with all his might, staggering the horney dragontaur.<br />
&quot;Freed? When did you get here? Why are you exposing yourself? Ah, where is my top?&quot;<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t remember?  You were about to rape me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I would never! I find you attractive but i- I did not mean to say that!&quot;<br />
Freed reached out to her when he felt his stomach clench painfully. His perspective was getting higher as he saw his legs bulk up quickly and sapphire scales formed on his dragon like legs, tearing his pants apart. Two growths formed on his lengthening and, changing and growing into a second pair of dragon claws. The shift in his hips forced him to stand on the 4 claws. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m becoming a dragontaur?&quot;<br />
&quot;No you are just getting the lower body of one, and no wings it seems.&quot;<br />
Freed&#39;s tail lost its fan tip and became a tapered end as dragonic spikes grew down his tail and dragon back. His twin dicks began to narrow out and shift into two dragon cocks with fleshy spines lining the length. His large balls still slung beneath his bulk.<br />
&quot;I gotta go!&quot; Freed bolted out the library, skidding on the polished floors as he rounded corners. Not looking were he was going.</p>
