<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter is in two &quot;arc&quot;. The first one stay &quot;at home&quot; with Lou, while the second follow Timothy outside.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While her master was away, Lou believed it was an ideal time to work on a pet project of hers.<br />
<br />
All the scheduled clients for the day were either already with their designated girl (or girls in a couple of case), or about to meet with, and most clients preferred to call anyway, so she should have the time to stop and pick-up the phone rather than run to open the door for someone wanting to make a last minute reservation.<br />
<br />
That personal project of hers was about her soul and the pain it caused her. No, she wasn&#39;t trying to get rid of it. But having a male soul is problematic when your body isn&#39;t. It&#39;s even worst when your mind agree with your body rather than with your soul. Thankfully, demons were adept at altering soul. It was a natural ability developed to feed more easily and efficiently while they infiltrated human society and, while demons bound to a summoner weren&#39;t infiltrating anything, they retained the ability.<br />
<br />
Naturally, a standing order to <strong>never</strong> manipulate anyone&#39;s soul was integrated into the subjugating runes of the summoning ritual, but having a soul she could briefly disobey an order, even if it was extremely energy consuming, as was altering a soul.<br />
Thankfully, she had all the time in the world and didn&#39;t need to do it in one go. Not only that but, while most of Timothy&#39;s succubi were away, not all of them were working today, which mean she could gorge herself before her self-assigned task.<br />
<br />
You see, while sex-demons find their sustenance in sex, for it to work they need one of the participant to have a soul. That&#39;s what Succubi usually don&#39;t have sex with their own kin, (no food there) and would only go after an incubus to perpetuate one of their two species. (Each parent hopping the kid will be one of <strong>their</strong> kind of sex-demon.) But Lou, having a soul of her own, can have sex with her fellow succubi and, as long as she take pleasure in it, any participating sex-demon would be fed.<br />
<br />
So all she needed for now was to convince at least one of her fellow succubi to have sex with her, in a house where there is rarely less than 3 hanging around simultaneously. Should be easy, right?<br />
<br />
Well, the operative word here is <strong>should</strong>, because right when she opened her mouth to ask, before any sound could come out, the bell rang. And wouldn&#39;t you know it, right on the other side of the door was a client who insisted on fucking Lou herself. Try as she might that right now she was standing in for ‘Nalkira’ and was, as such, unable to abandon her post to go with a client, he wouldn&#39;t listen, unsatisfied with her proposals of either taking another succubus instead or coming back the next day.<br />
- – — – -<br />
Meanwhile, Timothy was just arriving where he needed to be, namely the courthouse. Not as the defendant, but a victim. (Or rather, the <strong>owner</strong> of a victim.)<br />
<br />
He arrived early, but he always found better to come sooner rather than latter for such a serious thing. (In fact, he wasn&#39;t as early as he would have liked.) The problem is that, as a result, he had time to kill. He briefly looked at the automated coffee machine before remembering that, since he&#39;s stuck in a succubus&#39; body, it wouldn&#39;t affect him. Which got him thinking of both the benefices and drawbacks of his situation.<br />
<br />
First, on the positives, he was still able to eat but didn&#39;t need to. As long as he had sex regularly, he would be fed. (And having sex is easy when you&#39;re owning succubi.) He was also guaranteed to live a very long time, was far stronger, could fly, was able to shape-shift and the extra senses given by Nalkira&#39;s body helped him better understanding of what a client wanted, while the body itself gave him a better understanding of women. (Especially with how long he now had lived in it.) Speaking of this great body, it also attracted everyone&#39;s stare, and rarely to mock Timothy, which was quite a nice change of peace compared to his birth body.<br />
<br />
But, there were also drawbacks. The stare mentioned before? From most women, it was jealous ones. (He would have preferred appreciative, see interested looks coming from them, instead.) Worst was how men looked at him like he was a walking peace of meat, utterly disgusting. Then come the insatiable libido common to all sex-demons, causing him to always have at least part of his mind thinking of fucking and being fucked, to the point part of him want to do nothing but sex for the rest of his life. Add to it the proportions making him look like the nearest thing to a real-life Jessica Rabbi, or at least the demonic equivalent, (he still don&#39;t understand how the melons hanging from his chest don&#39;t give him back-pain) and the constant need to be seen and acknowledged as Nalkira rather than himself, putting a wall between him and the rest of the world, and it was far from an all positive situation.<br />
<br />
Well, not like he could change anything to it anyway. Even the magical app on his phone seemed unwilling to change the situation, refusing to target him (be it as Nalkira or Timothy) since he had turned his roommates into his succubi. (Which somehow had also multiplied them, but he wasn&#39;t going to look a gift horse in the mouth.)<br />
<br />
Coming back to reality, he saw that next to the coffee-machine, there was a drinks dispenser. Not only that, but among the choices, there was some clearly catering to sex-demons. Probably the nonsustaining sexual-fluids of soulless demons, but he didn&#39;t want sustenance, just something that would help him stay awake.<br />
<br />
The flavors proposed were labeled as &quot;Sperm&quot;, &quot;Gay Sperm&quot;, &quot;Vaginal Juice&quot; and &quot;Lesbian Juice&quot;. With the cheap stuff, there was no difference between the so called ‘heterosexual’ and ‘gay’ variants beside the label, the only sex-demons you could consider anything other than bisexual are among the ones with a soul.<br />
<br />
Timothy choose &quot;Lesbian Juice&quot;. Not that he consider himself a lesbian but, like said before, he need people to see him as female, making him unable to select a product catering toward incubi. But at the same time, behind that wall hiding his real-self from the world he still was an heterosexual man, and as such wouldn&#39;t drink sperm.<br />
<br />
He opened the can and took a first gulp, and was surprised to discover this particular brand was actually canning the good stuff. He don&#39;t know if they found girls turned-on by the idea of having succubi sipping on their fluids, or were somehow able to find enough sex-demons with a soul to mass-product hight-grade drink for said sex-demons, but he appreciated the result.<br />
<br />
As a result, Timothy was in a chipper mood when the doors to the courtroom of the trial opened. &quot;Time to make that guy pay for <strong>willingly</strong> damaging what&#39;s mine!&quot;</p>
