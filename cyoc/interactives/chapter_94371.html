<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Three years had passed since Jeff was born and he has completely accepted his life as a dog.  After all what else could he had been?      <br />
He remembered that when he had a few months of being born, he was bought from a man called Roberto that had decided to bought a dog for his son whose birthday was that day. So when he found an announcement of some old people that were selling german shepherd puppies not far way from where he was, he decided to go and buy one before going back home. <br />
When he arrived to the place, the owners told him that there was only one left, a small little pup who immediately ran to greet him. At that moment Roberto was sure that this pup was the right one for his family, he paid for him, and left. Meanwhile Jeff understood that he was going to leave with this human from now on, so he went to where his mommy was nuzzling her one last time, as if saying “Goodbye mommy”. Then he returned to where his new owner was and they left.<br />
 “But that was a long time ago” the german shepherd thought. Now he lived a peaceful and free life, always there for Roberto, his wife Laura and their son Daniel. Since the first day he lived with them, his new owners had gave him a name “John”, John was not only happy to finally have a name, but also of finding his place on this earth, or at least until the next weeks when he went to sleep. <br />
In the last weeks, John had been having dreams where he was not John the Alsatian, but a human whose name couldn´t remember. In every dream he was experiencing fragments of memories of what he supposed was from the human, the day he was born, his seventh birth, his first mate, but there was always one that caught his interest in which he was using a human machine with the words Chronivac 4.0 and he was writing information of someone, but every time he was about to fill the blank with the words “Target name” next to it, he wake up. Tonight would not have been different from others, except because this time he knew what to put in “Target name”, he wrote down the name Jeff and as a lightning all made sense to him. <br />
John awoke in fear that made him unable to control his body, his ears were down, tail wagging in agitation, he began to whimper, all because  of what he discovered, he was not always a dog, at some point he had been human and this human memories of his dreams were his. After a few minutes John started to calm down, he laid in his bed and tried to understand how this could be possible. <br />
While he was thinking, he did not realize what was happening around him as Daniel had gone down to the kitchen in search of a bottle of water. In his way back to his bedroom he noticed that something was bothering John so he approached and ask him “Is something bothering you buddy?” while he scratched the dog behind the ears.<br />
John noticing his human was there with him and asked him a question, he began moving his head from side to side as if saying “no”. <br />
Daniel  knowing german shepherd were very intelligent, understood John answer, so he went back to his room after saying his dog  “good night, have sweet dreams”. <br />
After Daniel had left, John returned to his thoughts<br />
During all his time as a dog he had lived a great life, but now that he remembered he used to be a human being, a strange feeling started to pass through his body it was as if his body had split in two. One side wanted to know who had been and how he had ended up as a German Shepherd, but in the other hand he wanted to continue his life as a dog as it was, he had everything a dog could wish for, he had shelter, food, water, a family that love him and treated him as one of them, even a mate.  It was a life without worries and full of happiness.<br />
 John asked himself: “Did he really was willing to leave all that behind just to return to a life that he barely remembered?”</p>
