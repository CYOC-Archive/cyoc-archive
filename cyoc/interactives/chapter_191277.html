<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No no, none of that,&quot; I chided, pushing the radio away with a foot. I guided her to the couch and sat her down as her biceps rippled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s..what&#39;s happening...&quot; she asked, still confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re becoming better. Stronger..&quot; I said, parting her legs and easing a couple of fingers into her. Her vagina contracted around my fingers, and her changes began to accelerate as she succumbed to pleasure. Her eyes opened wide as her forearms swelled, and she smiled, watching in fascination as her fingers stretched and grew tipped by talons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes..more...MORE!&quot; she demanded, grabbing my wrist and fucking my hand as her thighs swelled with muscle and grew covered in brown fur. I&#39;d originally wanted to change with her, but watching this new part of her emerge was erotic and satisfying in its own way. She smiled as her muzzle began to stretch, and her secondary teats formed. Her primary breasts hadn&#39;t shrunk, but they did seem to appear smaller by comparison, due to the sheer muscle mass in her torso. She came explosively onto my hand, letting out a powerful bass howl, and then rose to her feet, standing almost eight feet tall, her head nearly brushing my ceiling. She stared at me, licking her muzzle, and then my dominance over her truly took hold, and she knelt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change back,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
In a couple of minutes, she was back in her human shape, covered in a sheen of sweat from the change. &quot;..I..&quot; she stuttered, her mind trying to full grasp what had occurred. &quot;I..am...yours,&quot; she said. &quot;What will you have me do?&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled, and felt the otherness wash over me as I remembered that I was a goddess once more. &quot;Tell me your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Darlene Bowman,&quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Darlene..&quot; I said. &quot;In a week, the full moon will rise over this city.&quot;  Darlene reflexively smiled, and I watched her nipples harden. &quot;And when that happens, I plan to take this city. But for that to happen, I need your help.&quot; Darlene smiled as she ran her hands across her skin. Her scent intensified. She was eager both to help me and to feel the change again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything..&quot; she said, her eyes full of a hungry devotion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be discreet..but change EVERY woman on the force. Every single one. I don&#39;t care how. Use your pussy, use your fangs. Just make sure that  you don&#39;t get caught, and that when the full moon shines down upon the city, every single policewoman is one of mine.&quot;  The force of my words slammed into her mind. This wasn&#39;t a request. This wasn&#39;t even an order. This was a divine mandate from her new goddess. Her supreme deity.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be done,&quot; she said. Then she hesitated. &quot;But..&quot;<br />
<br />
I was caught off-guard. For a moment, there was irritation, even bordering on anger. Was she about to question MY will? But I held it back. No need to be the tyrant beast without provocation. &quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I..have a husband. And two daughters.&quot; She looked at me with uncertainty, and a pleading expression on her face. &quot;What about them?&quot;<br />
<br />
I hadn&#39;t considered that possibility; I&#39;d only been concerned with my own desire to start turning people. &quot;Does the wolf in you think he&#39;s worthy?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
She paused and considered the question. I could see her focusing on her new instincts, truly looking inside of herself for an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, nodding her head. &quot;He is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then do so with my blessing,&quot; I told her, getting a relieved smile in response. &quot;And..how old are your daughters?&quot; I asked. It was an important question. While I wasn&#39;t entirely averse to younger girls getting turned..the wolves created under my purview were deeply sexual. There was no need to awaken that in the underage, nor to unleash it upon them in pursuit of my new world.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re twenty,&quot; she replied. &quot;Twins. I..had them when I was young.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If they&#39;re your daughters, I presume they&#39;re worthy,&quot; I replied charitably. I was being genuine. I was already inclined to think more kindly of them because of having gifted their mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes..but..&quot; she paused. &quot;I..don&#39;t know that I should be the one to...do that.&quot; Her scent had flared again, and I realized that her instincts were playing a bit of havoc with her. She didn&#39;t want to bite them, because she didn&#39;t want to cause them pain. But that left only one other option, and she didn&#39;t want THAT either.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a good mother,&quot; I replied, despite the fact that I wouldn&#39;t have minded a mother-daughter-daughter scenario. Maybe because they weren&#39;t related to me. Maybe because my new divinity no longer concerned itself with many of the human taboos and morality. Maybe because a werewolf fetish is already strange, so nothing after that is off the table. Of course, it was no longer a fetish. It was part of my reality. Part of the world&#39;s reality, my brain reminded me. Still..a mother being concerned for her daughters&#39; well-being was proper. It was good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring them here,&quot; I reassured her. &quot;I&#39;ll take care of the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Darlene replied. <br />
<br />
Her radio squawked. &quot;Officer Bowman? You&#39;ve been radio silent for awhile now. Do you need backup?&quot; <br />
<br />
She smiled at me knowingly and picked up the radio. &quot;Negative. It was all a misunderstanding. Accidental. I&#39;ve been..talking to the citizen about avoiding that in the future. No charges to be filed. I&#39;m heading out now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;10-4. Base out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darlene slowly got dressed, even as her eyes still hungrily looked over my body.  Even as mine watched hers.  My core started warming up again as I remembered I&#39;d gone unsatisfied, and my natural inclinations once again reminded me that there was pussy right here in the room with me. WEREWOLF pussy. &quot;I..still haven&#39;t properly thanked you..&quot; Darlene told me, &quot;For giving me THIS..&quot; She smirked, pausing as she stood there in nothing but her bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later,&quot; I told her. &quot;Fulfill your role in the week to come, and you and I will celebrate my triumph together.&quot; I was enforcing a bit of dominance on her while giving her the carrot of motivation. &quot;But...before you go, I wish you&#39;d call your daughters and have them come over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
A shudder went through her as the power of the wish took hold fully. I realized that she would have obeyed even without the word. I didn&#39;t need to use it, and in fact, wasn&#39;t TRYING to use the ring. It was just a figure of speech. I made a mental note to watch what I said - this time it was minor. At the wrong time, such a turn of phrase could be catastrophic.<br />
<br />
She pulled her uniform pants on and removed her cellphone from her pocket, dialing the number. &quot;Lynn? What are you and your sister doing? Okay..okay,&quot; she said. It was mildly frustrating not to hear half of the conversation, but I knew it would work out. If it didn&#39;t, I could always force the situation. It&#39;s the nice thing about being a goddess - your will ALWAYS gets done, one way or the other.  &quot;So, I met this woman..and she&#39;s got an..opportunity for you and Lacey. It&#39;s..it&#39;s hard to explain. But TRUST ME when I tell you that this is not something you want to pass on. Write this address down..&quot; she read my address to them. For a moment I wondered how she knew it so effortlessly, then remembered that she would have gotten it in the complaint that had been filed. &quot;Her name is...&quot; her eyes widened as she realized she had never gotten my name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joella,&quot; I said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joella. So get your sister and come down here. She&#39;s...got some time right now.  Lynn..seriously. Don&#39;t give me that &#39;okay mom&#39; bullshit. I&#39;m being serious. This is life-changing. NO, I&#39;M NOT BEING OVERDRAMATIC. Promise me, Lynn. Okay, love you. We&#39;ll..talk more tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darlene gave me an apologetic look. &quot;I love my daughter, but she can be a bit headstrong.&quot; She finished getting dressed. &quot;But, assuming she listens, they should be here in around a half hour.&quot; She slowly approached me, and it was impossible for me not to find her sexier now, knowing what was contained in her otherwise pleasant, but mundane and largely average form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for doing this to me...and what you&#39;re going to do for my daughters.&quot; She leaned in and gave me a long, lingering kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;And thank you for what you&#39;re going to do for the rest of the women on the police force,&quot; I said with a smile. &quot;Just remember, be discreet.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded, then kissed me one last time. One hand moved to my chest, and I felt myself starting to heat up. &quot;Down girl,&quot; I told her. &quot;That&#39;s your reward for later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry..I&#39;m just so..horny..&quot; she said as she walked to the door. Her tone was half-apologetic and half matter-of-fact. I could only presume that due to having been directly turned by me, her libido had been cranked up about ten notches. Oh well. That sort of thing could be a great motivator. &quot;I&#39;m..mmmmhh..I&#39;m already thinking of what I&#39;m going to do to that cute dispatcher when we&#39;re off work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get to it, then,&quot; I said, letting the dominance in my voice resonate. &quot;Together, we will change the world.&quot;</p>
