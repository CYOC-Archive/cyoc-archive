<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claudia sighed, working at the Town Clerks office could be so boring.<br />
<br />
True, she was lucky to get the job. Between the pay, the hours, and the towns benefits and pension, Claudia realized she was truely fortunate to have such a great job. Still, it was nowhere near as exciting as Mikas job. &quot;Wonder what Mikas up to right now,&quot; she mused. &quot;She said something about Kumiko and Lisa planning on attending a fashion expo. Wonder if she&#39;s helping make plans? Got be more exciting than this.&quot; Claudia was now jolted from her musings as a mother and daughter entered, quickly making their way to her counter. &quot;Can I help you,&quot; she sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; Tanya smiled. &quot;Was wondering if you could help us. We&#39;re looking for the Moreland family residence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia raised an eyebrow, the question itself was odd, made doubly so by the fact they were asking for her in laws. Considering what the Morelands did for a living, (and the amount of enemies they had accumulated over the years), Claudia was suspicious. &quot;They&#39;re address isn&#39;t listed,&quot; she replied sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re old friends,&quot; Sylvia said quickly. &quot;My um mom here knew them in high school. She was on her way to see them and she lost the address.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Claudia answered, casting the pair a dubious look. After working with the Moreland family last year, Claudia was dubious. &quot;Listen can&#39;t help you,&quot; she replied. &quot;But I&#39;ll check on something for you. Why don&#39;t you leave an address and number and I&#39;ll contact you.&quot; Sylvia and Tanya thanked Claudia immensely, quickly scrawling a home address and number for Claudia.<br />
<br />
Neither ghost was aware that Claudia knew the Morelands. After a quick chat with Nina and Jacob, she learned that neither one had ever heard of these two. Thanking Claudia for looking out for the family, the Morelands decided on a plan of action. Giving Claudia their address, they instructed her to tell the two strange women. When they arrived the Morelands would spring a trap and interrogate the pair.<br />
<br />
&quot;So is this it,&quot; Sylvia asked as she gazed at the small farm that the Morelands resided on. Tanya nodded, putting the car in park as they exited the car. Approaching the two ghosts now swooned as they passed the property line. &quot;Did you feel that,&quot; Tanya asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sylvia groaned. &quot;Looks like this family has more protective runes than you can shake a stick at.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we be worried,&quot; Tanya asked. Sylvia shrugged, they were short on options, the Morelands were their only hope. Taking a breath the duo now approached the front door, hoping they would listen.<br />
<br />
Jacob now peaked out from the window upstairs. He didn&#39;t recognize these two, which he had suspected. The plan now was simple. He, Daphne, and Jim would jump the pair, tie them up, and interrogate them. The amount of runes protecting the house would offer the Morelands plenty of protection from whatever these two were planning. The only thing he hadn&#39;t planned for was Spark and Connor bringing his friends over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, Dad, I&#39;m home,&quot; Connor yelled. &quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind me bringing my friends over.&quot; Jacobs eyes went wide, he had only planned on putting himself in danger. Nina and the babies were secure and protected within the nursery. Now the one armed hunter had too worry about a group of teenagers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad you home,&quot; Connor called again. Jacob quickly glanced out the window. The two strangers had obviously been slowed by the initial runes but were still closing in on the front door. Quickly sprinting towards his son, Jacob had to protect the boy and his friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh where is he,&quot; Connor wondered. It was certainly odd for his parents to be out at this time. What was stranger was Daphne and Jim were nowhere to be seen. Turning to his friends, Connor now told them to have a seat and relax, someone was now knocking at the door. As Connor opened the door, he was surprised to see a mother and daughter he didn&#39;t recognize. &quot;Can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Connor get down!&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor jumped, diving for the floor as Jacob lept down the stairs with Daphne hot on his heels. Already the one armed hunter had drawn his pistol, leveling it at the pair who now shrieked in terror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa we surrender,&quot; th5e exclaimed, a little too late as the golem Daphne now tackled the pair. Connor and his friends gaping at the scene, filing behind Jacob as they stared at the scene before them.<br />
<br />
Daphne had effectively pinned the two women to the ground. The Amazonian golem useing her bulk to keep the pair in place. Jacob now aimed his pistol at one of the women while Jim, the immortal skull rested on the other growling and threatening to tear her throat out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you,&quot; Jacob exclaimed. &quot;Talk! Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad,&quot; Connor asked, the teen bewildered as his friends stared in stunned silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay back boy,&quot; he called. &quot;I don&#39;t know who these people are but they picked the wrong family!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not hear to hurt you,&quot; Sylvia wheezed. &quot;We need your help!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bullshit,&quot; Jacob grumbled. &quot;Now you want to start telling the truth or should I have Jim here rip your throat out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not lying,&quot; Tanya exclaimed, the womans face turning red under Daphne&#39;s weight. &quot;We came because we need your help taking care of Ezekiel Kane!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ezekiel Kane,&quot; Jacob asked, his eyes going wide in surprise. The experienced hunter now lowering his weapon as he looked thevtwo women over. Connor was still unsure, casting his father a curious look. &quot;Dad who&#39;s Ezekiel Kane?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A hunter,&quot; Jacob said softly. &quot;Well, more like ex hunter. Church kicked him out years ago. Man&#39;s nuttier than Squirrel shit and more violent than a rabid wolverine.&quot; Jacob now glowered at the two women, bow did they know who Kane was. &quot;Start talking. How do you know Kane?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because he killed us,&quot; Sylvia exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa,&quot; Spark stated. &quot;Back up a second. How did he kill you? You guys look pretty alive to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re ghosts,&quot; Tanya stated. &quot;We were in a coven of witches. Kane killed us 13 years ago. We possessed these two to get your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kane&#39;s been dark for years,&quot; Jacob said softly. &quot;No one knows where he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hes coming here,&quot; Sylvia said. &quot;Kane heard about the vampires. He heard that there&#39;s a colony of wizards here. He&#39;s coming to take them all out and anybody associated with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter to Kane if you haven&#39;t done anything,&quot; Tanya added. &quot;If you&#39;re supernatural in nature, magical in nature, he&#39;ll kill you with a smile on his face.&quot;  Nat now paled at that last comment. Thoughts of her families safety immediately coming to forefront of her mind. Would Kane target her and her parents?<br />
<br />
&quot;Daphne,&quot; Jacob said slowly. &quot;Let em up and go keep Nina and the babies safe.&quot; Daphne did as she was told, rising to her feet and glowering at the ghosts before leaving. As Tanya and Sylvia now dusted themselves off, Jacob looked first to the ghosts before turning to Nat and her friends. &quot;You better come with me kids,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;If Kane is on his way then your going to need all the information you can get.&quot;</p>
