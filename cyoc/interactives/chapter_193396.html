<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Neil and Max followed Bradley to the weights. Dressed as he was, in tight clothes that looked ready to pop, it was hard not to be distracted by his massive muscles; Neil wanted to touch them, while Max wanted to outgrow them! &quot;All right boys,&quot; Bradley boomed, &quot;You&#39;ve done a kick-ass job all by yourselves; not going to say otherwise! Mad respect, for real. But you&#39;ve come to the best--me--because you want to amp it up! And that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do today. We&#39;re not just going to take it to eleven, we&#39;re going to go all the way to fourteen or even fifteen, if your bodies can take it! Are you ready?&quot; <br />
<br />
Neil and Max both nodded. Normally Bradley was cool and confident, effortlessly masculine. But he was amped up, ready to go, possessed by a wild energy that excited and aroused all at the same time. &quot;Neil, we&#39;re going to get this Sandra chick you mentioned. She&#39;s going to be so crazy about you that you&#39;ll be fighting her off! And Max, we&#39;re going to make you match that name of yours. A maxxed out stud who can&#39;t be ignored! Now let&#39;s do some serious lifting!&quot; <br />
<br />
The workout that followed was brutal. Bradley observed his two trainees closely, adjusting the timing of their lifts, the weight used, and the rest periods between based on what he saw. Occasionally he corrected their form, but he was always encouraging, cheering on both young men, urging them on to greater performance. His next client was a no-show, which produced a brief flash of annoyance on his handsome face as he got the notice on his phone. But that meant more time with his newest trainees. He pushed them harder and longer than planned, half an hour past their original stopping time. By the end of it, Neil and Max were exhausted but happy, having just endured the most intense workout they&#39;d ever experienced. <br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me, boys,&quot; Bradley invited, strutting out toward some of the side rooms of the gym. Neither student had been in them before; they looked like offices or something. But they followed anyway, and were led to a moderately sized room full of mirrors. Bradley closed the door behind them. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is the posing room. Not many gyms have this, only a few. Usually hardcore places. I convinced the last manager to put one in. Had to fuck her a few times in it to make my point.&quot; He grinned unrepentantly. Then he turned to face the mirrors and pulled off his too-tight polo shirt. Neil gasped softly at the sight of Bradley&#39;s bare torso. Huge pecs sat above a well-defined, rock-hard eight pack. His lats were thick with muscle and his back was a series of mountain ranges of pure beef. A moment later his shorts came off, leaving him only in his underwear. It was Max&#39;s turn to go wide-eyed, seeing Bradley&#39;s big, powerful calves, his enormous thighs and the big package that bulged alluringly between them. <br />
<br />
&quot;If either of you want to compete,&quot; Bradley continued, staring at his massive reflection in the mirrors, &quot;You need to learn to pose. It&#39;s not just standing up there and flexing your arms a few times.&quot; Bradley raised his arms and flexed both, his biceps rising madly. &quot;You need to figure out what angle to hold your arms at, how to rotate them, and so on,&quot; he explained, as he changed the position of his arms several times, some showing him off better, others not so much. &quot;All to hopefully impress a panel of judges that you can barely see, out in front of the audience.&quot; <br />
<br />
The massive trainer held the pose for a minute, then slowly dropped it. &quot;Shirts off. Arms up. Show me what we&#39;re working with here, boys,&quot; he instructed. Neil and Max looked at him, then at one another. Slowly, Neil pulled off his shirt, revealing his ripped, buff torso. He hesitated a moment, then slowly lifted his arms, his softball-sized biceps rising under the skin of his upper arms. &quot;Looking amazing, Neil!&quot; Bradley enthused, &quot;I want to see those big arms pop from all the muscle under there!&quot; Neil flexed obligingly. <br />
<br />
Max&#39;s shirt was still on. &quot;You too, bro,&quot; Bradley said encouragingly to Max. As the new trainee hesitated, Bradley was sympathetic. &quot;You&#39;ve made great progress in the last few days, bro. We can all see it. You weren&#39;t in the best shape when you came in, but your drive and your results have blown me away. Let&#39;s see what we&#39;ve got.&quot; <br />
<br />
Blushing, Max pulled off his shirt. He still had some pudge around his middle, but nonetheless, the change was dramatic. His big gut was gone. Muscle had clearly formed under his skin. Although it was large lumps of brawn, obscured by fat, it was clear that the muscle was there. Max raised trembling arms, then quickly flexed. His eyes widened at his own reflection as he saw two distinct lumps of muscle push up under his skin, much, much bigger than he was expecting! <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it, Max!&quot; Bradley said encouragingly. Max&#39;s arms were nearly the size of Neil&#39;s, but not as lean. &quot;Fuck bro,&quot; Bradley continued, &quot;The way you&#39;ve been going, you&#39;re going to be bigger than ol&#39; Neil here in no time. Maybe me too!&quot; Max was heartened by what the huge trainer said. He held his arms up proudly and flexed as Bradley gave both of his trainees tips on how to make their bodies look bigger and more impressive when on a bodybuilding stage. <br />
<br />
Pose after pose was displayed, with friendly encouragement offered from Bradley as his trainees tried to emulate him. After a solid twenty minutes, the exhausted duo stopped practicing, sitting down to recuperate while Bradley displayed a few more poses.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So, uh, what&#39;s it like? Competing, I mean?&quot; Neil asked, watching with interest as Bradley displayed a side-chest pose, showing off his arms, his legs, and of course his chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Competing is the worst and the best at the same time,&quot; Bradley replied. &quot;It sucks because of the dieting. Trying to get that bodyfat down. Worried about losing muscle too. Your lifts going down.&quot; He switched poses, his hands up behind his head, his amazing eight pack on display. &quot;But it&#39;s awesome too. You can see your muscles so well! You&#39;re just lean as fuck, hard as fuck, every muscle ready to show on command... And then you get up on that stage and you just show off... it&#39;s half modeling, half lovemaking. You want to make love to the crowd. And the judges.&quot; <br />
<br />
Neil was nodding along. He was beginning to think about competing himself. Max wasn&#39;t there yet, but Neil certainly was. &quot;Must be great afterwards. Not having to diet like that,&quot; Neil speculated. <br />
<br />
Bradley laughed, before shifting to a side-triceps pose that made the horseshoe in his arm pop dramatically. &quot;The epic cheat meals after are nice, for sure. But that&#39;s not really my favorite part. It&#39;s the sex! Bodybuilding shows are crazy! There&#39;s male and female divisions, after all. So there&#39;s a lot of sexual tension. And that leads to, well... Sometimes it&#39;s with your other competitors; sometimes it&#39;s fans! One time, I had these two chicks--twins, even, but not the kind that looked the same. Anyway, they both had great tits and they absolutely loved big ol&#39; muscle guys like me--well, like *us.*&quot; He winked at Neil and Max at that last bit. &quot;Anyway, they were total freaks in bed, wanting to ride my cock, wanting me to lick their pussy, whatever. And they got off so much on my muscles! It was incredible! &quot; <br />
<br />
Both Neil and Max were paying attention by then. &quot;So, does this happen a lot, then?&quot; Max asked, his curiosity overwhelming any reticence he may have felt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Bradley laughed, &quot;With the amount of testosterone in the air at these things, you can&#39;t help but have it happen! It&#39;s constant! Every show, recently!&quot; He put his fists on his hips and flared his lats, a classic pose. Then he began to drive his hips forward, thrusting his sizable bulge in an unmistakably sexual fashion. &quot;You got to find the groupies. They love muscle and they love dick. And the higher you place, the wilder they get. Fuck! Half the reason I still go is so that I can fuck them!&quot; He laughed as he increased the tempo of his thrusts, simulating a vigorous fucking. <br />
<br />
&quot;So lots of chicks, right?&quot; Max asked. He sounded hopeful. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Lots of chicks,&quot; Bradley confirmed, grinning impishly. &quot;Exclusively chicks, until yesterday.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Neil asked, perking up. <br />
<br />
Bradley blushed. &quot;Never did it with a guy before. But this week I&#39;ve been, I don&#39;t know... curious? Anyway, this guy I&#39;ve been training for about half a year? Anyway, he suddenly breaks through his plateau! He&#39;s starting to look real good. Tight but also buff. His definition finally coming in. Not huge, but his muscle was starting to really look good. Like, how all of a sudden you realize all the progress you&#39;ve made, but you missed it because it&#39;s been you in the mirror every day for the gradual progression... anyway, he was hot. I suddenly realized it. He suddenly realized it. And next thing you know, we&#39;re back at his apartment and my balls are slamming into his glutes as I fuck his brains out!&quot; Bradley laughed sheepishly. &quot;It was my first time with a guy, but I&#39;ve got to say... Up until yesterday, I didn&#39;t know what I was missing!&quot;</p>
