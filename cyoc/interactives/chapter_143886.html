<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Episode 837 in the overall series folks! WOW!<br/>
But remember the nature of the characters and their ages, besides the fact this is all just creative writing.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well,&quot; purred Martha, &quot;I can think of what would make this day even better,&quot; as she nuzzled up against her husband.<br />
&quot;Definitely after supper,&quot; said William happily, as human lips kissed feline ones.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m grateful that this day turned out better than I feared it might. Overall, we&#39;ve been good parents to the boys,&quot; observed his wife, leaning her furry body against his clothed one. &quot;But there are times when I can&#39;t help wondering what it would be like to have a daughter.&quot;<br />
&quot;On one hand, we no longer have to worry about our ages,&quot; conceded William, as he started assuming his vulpine form. A fox dressed in human clothing was a tad uncomfortable until he reached around and freed his tail from his pants.<br />
&quot;If we were still regular humans instead of proud members of were society, we might not be able to safely have another child. But now,&quot; he said, as the werefox embraced his werecat mate, &quot;other than making sure you and any further children are both healthy, we could conceivably have as many kids as we can support until sometime near our third century of life, or somewhere there abouts, as far as I know,&quot; he added, before vulpine and feline kissed.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; purred Martha, as she rubbed her muzzle against his. &quot;But sometimes I do wonder about the outcome.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked William, as he started nuzzling her neck.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a fox. I&#39;m a cat. What would that make our next child?&quot;<br />
&quot;Loved,&quot; was all he said, before the happy couple kissed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;OOOH! RIGHT THERE! HARDER! FASTER! DEEPER!&quot;<br />
On all fours &quot;doggie style&quot;, she could feel the hard cock of her partner filling her as she screamed out her pleasure.<br />
His top knot was rubbing her just right even as his lupine penis rammed even further into her moist depths.<br />
&quot;Oh... Morgan...&quot; cried Spencer Lawson, as she tried to catch her breath.<br />
The werewolf behind her just wrapped his furry arms around her, caressing her breasts before pulling Spencer backwards to lay on top of him as he laid on the ground in the woods behind the Barr house.<br />
After school, Spencer had headed over to his place as soon as she could.<br />
Together, the two of them sat in the living room of the Barr home and traded small talk as they worked on their respective homework assignments.<br />
That was kind of odd, considering that she was attending Moon Lake High while he was home schooled, since Morgan&#39;s parents didn&#39;t believe in vaccinations. After all, weres hardly ever got ill, so what was the point?<br />
Spencer was uncertain whether his folks were right or wrong.<br />
All she cared about was keeping an eye on the time until it neared sunset.<br />
With his mother&#39;s permission, Spencer and Morgan walked out into the woods behind his place.<br />
The first chance they got without violating any of Moon Lake&#39;s public display laws, they started hastily kissing and undressing each other before assuming their fursonas and...<br />
<br />
<i>Morgan might not of had much experience when it came to sex before meeting me, but he&#39;s certainly a quick learner,</i> thought Spencer happily, as the hybrid werewolf-panther-cat mix reached one paw to clasp his hands to her bosom while the other drifted down to tease her clit and what was visible of his still hard lupine red rocket buried deep within her.<br />
Morgan moaned in pleasure at the caress of his lover, licking her right ear and nuzzling her neck.<br />
Privately, he was hoping for much more than just having a &quot;friend with benefits&quot;, but knew better than to push the issue and risk not having Spencer in his life at all.<br />
Despite her teasing, Morgan&#39;s cock finally grew flaccid enough to slip out of her hungry pussy.<br />
Empty but satisfied, for the moment, Spencer flipped herself over until her full breasts were against his furry chest, her still hard nipples being caressed by wolf fur.<br />
They kissed and caressed each other for a bit, careful to maintain but not overexcite the passion within each other too soon, until Spencer spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan...&quot; she began. &quot;You do know that, being part werecat on my mother&#39;s side, I&#39;m bi, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;So?&quot; he asked in return. &quot;As long as you don&#39;t have a problem with me being straight...&quot;<br />
&quot;No. That&#39;s not it. My dad&#39;s as straight as the proverbial arrow. But there are times when...&quot;<br />
&quot;Look. If sometimes you want to be with a woman instead of a man, or me, I&#39;m cool with it. After all, some of the things that go on at the end of pack meetings...&quot;<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said Spencer, while using her feline instincts to lick his muzzle. &quot;The reason I&#39;m bringing this up is because, while they couldn&#39;t do much while my dad was in the military without running the risk of exposing us or adding to the were population, my folks are getting their paws back into the Swingers&#39; scene around here now that we&#39;ve moved back to Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
&quot;So?&quot; said Morgan, wondering where this conversation was leading.<br />
&quot;That means my mom occasionally has extra men and they both share the additional women.&quot;<br />
The thought of all that sex made Morgan&#39;s cock twitch, which Spencer felt between her legs.<br />
Knowing that she had him interested in the topic at hand, she continued speaking. &quot;I was just wondering if there&#39;d be times when you might be interested in something similar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Me, you, and your mother?&quot; asked Morgan in disgust.<br />
&quot;WHAT? HELL NO! Besides, that&#39;d be incest,&quot; pointed out Spencer. <i>Boy, there&#39;s time when I have to remember just how naive you are.</i><br />
&quot;Then what do you mean? Me, you, and another woman?&quot; asked Morgan, as his cock twitched again.<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; said Spencer with a smile. &quot;Or maybe me with another man while you&#39;re with his girl,&quot; she suggested, before French kissing the werewolf.<br />
Morgan was lost in both thought and the sensations of the moment.<br />
Spencer&#39;s breasts rubbing against his chest as their tongues danced between each other&#39;s mouths while she closed her legs against his hardening cock.<br />
&quot;Did you... have someone in mind?&quot; he finally got the chance to ask, once their lips eventually parted.<br />
&quot;What? No,&quot; lied Spencer, while thinking of Eric Anderson and his girlfriend Julie Stovall.* &quot;It&#39;s just that, since you took care of my last heat cycle, which can be a real killer considering I&#39;m a hybrid were and all three parts of me experience it at the same time, we&#39;ve become friends. And while I enjoy our friendship and time together,&quot; she added, while caressing his face with one paw, &quot;I&#39;m starting to feel... other urges, that unfortunately you can&#39;t satisfy.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Morgan, staring at his partner. &quot;Well, I do appreciate you being up front and honest with me about this Spencer.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; she replied, repositioning herself so her head was cradled on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this going to be a life long thing?&quot; wondered Morgan.<br />
&quot;Afraid so,&quot; admitted Spencer. &quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean we <i>both</i> can&#39;t enjoy it,&quot; she purred, while pressing herself harder against him.<br />
&quot;Hmm...&quot; said Morgan, while lovingly putting a furry arm around her. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t mind sharing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not as long as you don&#39;t mind being shared with another woman. From what I&#39;ve heard of their activities, my folks are quite happy with the arrangement.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Morgan, thinking it over. <i>I&#39;ve never considered, let alone participated in a threesome before in my life,</i> thought the teenager. <i>But me and TWO women at the same time...</i><br />
As Spencer felt his trapped cock twitch between her legs again, she just remained silent while using her free arm to gently caress him.<br />
Finally, Morgan said, &quot;Well, until you, all I&#39;ve ever been with are just a couple of she-wolves, and despite being a hybrid, you&#39;re certainly a lot of she-wolf.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Spencer replied, before kissing him.<br />
&quot;As long as my folks don&#39;t find out...&quot;<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t regret this honey,&quot; replied Spencer, before kissing him again.<br />
Then, with just a smile on her muzzle, she moved into position and mounted him, riding Morgan like a cowgirl on a bucking bronco.<br />
<i>Don&#39;t know whether I&#39;ll ever share Eric and Julie* with you after I&#39;ve claimed them, but we&#39;ll certainly have our own threesomes in time now that the seed is planted. And speaking of seeds...</i> thought Spencer, before making sure Morgan filled her once more with hot werewolf cum as they orgasmed together.<br />
<br />
_________________________________________________________<br />
*Not having much experience with other weres until her parents recently moved back to Moon Lake, Spencer knows that Eric and Julie are an engaged were-mer couple, but has yet to comprehend the full extent of their status.—tmw.</p>
