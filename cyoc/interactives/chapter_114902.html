<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“William, what the hell is going on!”<br />
<br />
William looked at the seventy year old man that was his other next door neighbor. Old man Johnson as he liked to refer to him. Just coming back from his stroll with Martha, William was confused as to what the elderly man was talking about.<br />
<br />
“I tried calling, because of the noises coming from your home, Johnson griping; “yet no one is answering.”<br />
“And you decided to snap at me,” William getting defensive; “when you can plainly see I was having a walk with my wife!”<br />
“That doesn’t explain the loud animal sounds,” Johnson barking at William.<br />
“My son is a werewolf,” William growling lowly; “his wife is a were-lioness. You are probably hearing those two celebrating their marriage in a traditional fashion.”<br />
“Eric got married,” Johnson looking stunned; “isn’t he too young for such responsibilities?”<br />
“It’s not Eric,” Martha speaking up; “Nate our eldest had a were-wedding with Jean Talbot.”<br />
“Were-what,” Johnson looking irritated; “what are you getting on about?”<br />
“You wouldn’t understand,” Martha walking by the old man; “you’re a normal.”<br />
<br />
A loud roar could be heard throughout the entire neighborhood; making the three pause as a few more roars and howls could also be heard. William and Martha chuckling as they knew what just transpired, while old man Johnson just glared.<br />
“Look,” Johnson clearly spoiling for a fight; “you may be were’s but all this loud rutting as your kind calls it has to stop.”<br />
“And why should it,” William looking at the man; “it’s all we have at the moment thanks to the were-alert we are under. Until it’s lifted, none of us can’t run in the woods, hunt, chase and other were related extracurricular activities. I suggest you talk to your son,” William knowing he became the family were; “get him to explain this to you.”<br />
“Other than that,” Martha looks at the old man; “get a pair of noise cancelling headphones if you want quiet.”<br />
“I’m warning you,” Johnson trying to be as threatening as possible; “this better end soon, or I will call the police. Again; and I won’t care if it’s you, the Twists or anyone else!”<br />
<br />
William and Martha watch as the old man storms off; agile, despite his age. Seeing him enter his home next door and slamming the door.<br />
“What is his problem,” William looking at Martha; “he normally isn’t this grumpy.”<br />
“Your guess is as good as mine,” Martha shrugging her shoulders; “but perhaps we should talk to Nate and Jean. Let them know that they are making a fair bit of noise.”<br />
“As well as Eric,” William seeing Spencer’s bronco parked at the curb; “make sure he and his girls tone down their yowling and howling.”<br />
<br />
Martha smiles as she opens the door; both were-foxes are blasted with a strong smell of sex permeating throughout the house. Both immediately feel flushed as they can tell five were’s were rutting with wild abandon. Eric, Frieda and Spencer’s combined scents during sex acting as a powerful aphrodisiac; it took all of Martha’s willpower to close the front door and to not rip her husband’s clothes off him and take him in the front lawn.<br />
“Perhaps we should pay the Twist’s a visit,” Martha gasping; “wait as our son’s and their mates tire themselves out.”<br />
“It won’t clear out the intoxicating smell,” William looking at Martha with a lustful gaze; “we will be coupling later and you know it.”<br />
“If you’re lucky,” Martha looking at William with a lustful gaze; “you might get to see me and two were-cats writhe around in pure sexual bliss.”<br />
“Even after we had that fun at the Hales,” William growling; “you still want to swing some more.”<br />
“Well it’s been awhile since Samantha and Frances,” Martha heading over to the Twist’s front door and knocking; “had some fun with us.”<br />
&quot;You have a point there,&quot; William looking thoughtful; &quot;just so long as we have some personal fun time then.&quot;<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Nate was panting as he enjoyed eating Jean out; the edible undies she was wearing, combined with her vaginal juices made for a delightful treat that Nate eagerly devoured. Bringing Jean to the height of passion as she roared; letting her were-lioness fursona out and gleefully wrestling her mate to be on top. The passion the two shared as Nate pleasured her body; it was long before her grinding, feeling Nate in her caused the two to express themselves passionately again as both climaxed quickly and suddenly with Jean collapsing on top of her werewolf mate in utter bliss. Neither knew or cared that the whole neighbourhood hear their passionate roaring; they only cared for the moment they both shared and reveled in.<br />
<br />
“God dam,” Nate panting; “that was intense.”<br />
“I know,” Jean resting her head on Nates chest; “it’s like something got inside me and drove me wild. I loved it,” Jean purring; “I’m going to enjoy eating you out.”<br />
“So where is this edible underwear you got for me,” Nate nuzzling his mate; “and will it fit me?”<br />
“In the blue bag,” Jean purring; “and it should fit you. As long as you shift back to your human form.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Spencer and Frieda gasped and sighed as they enjoyed Eric in their usual fashion. The girls eagerly eating each other out in a sixty nine position, with Eric mounting the one on top and stimulating her with his barbed feline penis. Their passion reaching a crescendo as all three announced their pleasure in typical animal fashion. With tails thrashings and loud yowling erupting in the basement rec room; Eric, Spencer and Frieda sighed as they enjoyed their shared orgasms.<br />
<br />
Enjoying the moment; the three were unconcerned that leaving the basement door open has rapidly flooded the entire house with their combined scent. A powerful aphrodisiac that drives other were’s wild with lust.<br />
“I’m going to miss these moments when school starts Tuesday,” Spencer sighing; “Only being able to get together on Friday and the weekends.”<br />
“That’s assuming,” Frieda looking at Spencer above her; “I don’t have a baby sitting job, or Eric is busy tutoring.”<br />
“Dam your after school jobs,” Spencer pouting; “I’m genuinely jealous of you two. All I have is a baby brother and a few boring ride-a-longs with the town’s police department.”<br />
“Ride-A-Longs,” Eric speaking up; “what are those?”<br />
“You ride with a police officer as he or she explains a typical shift they go through. It only lasts a couple of hours and sometimes you get to watch the officer write someone a speeding ticket.”<br />
Deputy Spencer Lawson,” Frieda laughing; “has a funny ring to it.”<br />
“That’s because it will be Deputy Spencer Anderson,” Spencer looking at Frieda coyly; “I’m taking Eric’s name when we get married.”<br />
“Only deputy,” Eric purring; “don’t you think Sheriff Spencer Anderson has a better ring to it?”<br />
“I never thought of that,” Spencer smiling; “it does sound better.”</p>
