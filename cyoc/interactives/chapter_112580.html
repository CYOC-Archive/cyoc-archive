<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Lance and Lila left for the evening; the chatting adults noticed, Eric, Spencer and Frieda darting out of the estate into the nearby woods. Not knowing of the mischief the three planned as they ran around under the light of the waning moon; Lila giggles as Benton’s attempts to prevent the aromatic spread of Frieda and her friends sexual escapades throughout the house fail. With all four getting a whiff of the intoxicating aroma, it was long before thoughts of carnal acts with their respective mate’s started taking route.<br />
<br />
“Guess your attempts to smell proof Frieda’s room failed brother,” Lance looking at his pregnant wife with a lustful gaze; “because I got a good smell of their combined scents-“<br />
“I get the picture,” Benton shaking his head; “Amanda take your paw off my sheathe.”<br />
“Oh,” Amanda looking bashful; “I didn’t realize I had my paw there.”<br />
“I think we should get going,” Lila getting up; “I’ll drive Lance, unless of course you are capable of keeping your paws off me until we get home.”<br />
“I’ll try,” Lance grinning; “but remember, we still have to pick up beer for your brother tommorow.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
With Lance and Lila gone, Benton pounced on his were-panthress wife. Eager to be with her and her with him; they rapidly begin to explore each other’s furry body’s as they race upstairs to the bedroom.<br />
“You seem to be in a good mood,” Amanda kissing her husband; “what’s changed?”<br />
“Lance gave me some interesting news,” Benton kissing Amanda back; “it helped me figure out who was messing with the completion of the new elementary school.”<br />
“That’s good,” Amanda peeling herself form her husband; climbing on the bed as gets on all fours, making sure to display her sex to Benton. “Now get over here and fill me.”<br />
<br />
“Rawr,” Benton happily growls as he leaps on to the bed to claim his wife. Driving his panther prick into her warm moist tunnel; Benton happily rumbles as Amanda yowls, the barbs on Benton’s member digging in and stimulating Amanda into the first of many orgasms for her.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
After making it safely home from the Knight Estate; Lance was purring as Lila had a firm grip on his pink member out from it’s sheathe on full display. Constantly stroking and massaging it; Lila was an expert in bringing Lance to the brink, only to deny him release. Giving him a stern look as she got out to pick up beer for her brother; Lila grinned as Lance in his were-panther fursona pants and whines as he eagerly wants his pleasure.<br />
<br />
Now safely inside; Lance wastes no time in removing Lila’s clothes off of her. Staring at her body in its naked glory; her firm breasts swelling as Lila’s mammaries prepare to produce milk. Lila was pregnant; her baby bump visible and pleasing to Lance as he knows, the cub growing in Lila is his. Purring as Lila walks up to him; her smooth naked skin on his soft black fur; Lance smiles as he feels Lila’s hand on his still throbbing member, giving it a light tap as she guides him to the bedroom. No words were spoken as Lila takes Lance to the bed and begins to orally pleasure him.<br />
<br />
Licking the pre-cum off his tip, before sucking on the head; Lila smiles as she looks at her were-panther mate purring loudly, his large paws on her shoulders as she envelops Lance’s member into her mouth.  With all the teasing she did earlier on the drive home; Lila wasn’t surprised to feel Lance blow his load so quickly. She was surprised as to the amount he let loose; huge jets shooting forth, Lila could barely keep the warm salty treat in her mouth as some trickled out at the corner.<br />
<br />
Consuming the entire load; Lila gets up. Seeing her mate feeling extremely satisfied as he purrs while embracing her; gently carrying her to bed.<br />
“I told you earlier,” Lance purring; “I was going to be your blanket for the night.”<br />
“You’re so warm and soft,” Lila smiling; “keep our child warm Lance. Place your paws on my belly love.”<br />
“Gladly,” Lance kissing his wife all the while embracing her from behind; “You know I think we forgot to take the beer inside from the car.”<br />
“Do that tomorrow morning,” Lila snuggling into Lance even more; “just sleep with me like this.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Thrusting in and out of the slick tunnel; Benton was on the cusp of his climax. Eager to keep the moment going and to give Amanda the most pleasure; Benton pulls out of his wife. Flipping her onto her back as he spreads her legs and plunges into her eager slit once again; thrusting in and out his barbed penis digging in and causing Amanda to sigh and gasp with each thrust. Feeling his moment come; Benton makes a few final thrusts before he explodes; his member tensing and twitching as his seed spills forth. Amanda yowls in pleasure as her climax comes forth; feeling the barbs flex and bite into her as a warm feeling spills inside her, Amanda looks at her husband and purrs.<br />
“Now that you got that out of your system,” Amanda chuckling; “perhaps you’ll tell me what Lance told you.”<br />
“Nope,” Benton chuckling; “that will just kill the mood. Let’s just enjoy the happy moment,” Benton purring; “I’ll tell you what Lance and I talked about in my study tomorrow.”<br />
“I’ll hold you to that,” Amanda comments as she and Benton shift, enjoying the reverse spooning as each embrace each other.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“Well that was fun,” Frieda speaking as her bloody muzzle rises from the rabbit carcass she was devouring. Stalking the forest for small treats to feed Frieda’s pet snake Ralph; the three stumbled across a sow bear and her two cubs. Taking care not to disturb and enrage the protective mother as the bear cubs approach the three weres, curious of their scents. Doing their best not to be threatening as the mother looks on, making her presence known; Eric, Frieda and Spencer take it as their cue to quickly dash away before the bear tries to maul them.<br />
<br />
Catching a few rabbits and couple of mice; the three head back to the estate as they happily devour their snack.<br />
“I thought wildlife,” Eric speaking; “were afraid of us weres, even outright hostile in some cases.”<br />
“It depends,” Spencer speaking; “if you approach a mother and her young, like we just did with the grizzly bear we came across, then yeah. Mommas going to fight,” Spencer snapping some bones to get at the marrow; “but like elk, deer and other prey animals; most will just flee upon catching our scent.”<br />
“Unless of course,” Frieda remember last winter; “they are hungry and desperate. Like the cougar that tried to attack us once.”<br />
<br />
“Did they ever find out who fired that bolt,” Eric recalling the event. Remember Benton having to kill the creature after they had a catch and release hunt; Frieda catching the buck with Benton watching and looking pleased.<br />
“Not that I know of,” Spencer answering; “but let’s not dwell on it. We have some mice to give to a hungry snake,” holding up the bag containing a half dozen squirming critters.<br />
Who elected you as the bag holder,” Eric licking his bloody lips; clearly craving a few mice squirming in his stomach as he eats them whole.<br />
“Since you eat them as fast as we catch them,” Spencer answering; “now go back to gnawing on your rabbit, you silly white furred were-panther.”<br />
“Yeah,” Frieda shaking her head; “these mice are for Ralph.”<br />
<br />
After finishing their rabbits and heading back inside; the three notice George, the Knight’s were-tiger butler locking the place up for the evening. Seeing Frieda and her friends come back inside and noticing the blood on their muzzles; George knew they caught some game and made a meal of it.<br />
“Rabbit,” Frieda answering the question on George’s lips; “we caught some rabbit and snacked on it.”<br />
“Your aunt and uncle have left,” George answering; “and your parents have retired for the night.”<br />
“We are going to clean up and head to bed shortly,” Frieda responding; “are you going out for a run in the woods?”<br />
“I might,” George thinking upon himself; “it is something I haven’t done in a while.”<br />
“Then be careful,” Frieda warning the were-tiger butler; “we stumbled across a sow bear with her cubs in the forest nearby.”<br />
“Shall I alert the authorities,” George grabbing the phone.<br />
“No need,” Spencer answering; “as long as you don’t harm the cubs, the mother bear will leave you be.”<br />
“Night George,” Frieda speaking as Eric and Spencer follow her upstairs.</p>
