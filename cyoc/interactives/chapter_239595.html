<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr. Katherine Eastly grunted in annoyance as she pushed away from her work station. Despite New Horizons superior lab equipment, she was no closer to finding a cure for herself.<br />
<br />
The last few weeks were a whirlwind for Dr. Eastly. Two months ago, she resided in the kitsune realm helping her old friend Hinata overthrow the ruling kitsune family. Now, she and her friend, Dr. Neil Chapman, were fugitives in the employ of New Horizon. Once more, Katherine found herself working with Casseus, helping the dark wizard in his legitimate and illegitimate endeavors. Needless to say, Katherine longed to see Hinata once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Eastly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine turned, noting the Soul Drive Alpha standing behind her. Alpha was an oddity to the scientist. Created in the early 22nd century, Alpha followed Casseus and others into the past in a failed effort to alter the future. Designed to look like an anthropomorphic raven, the robot now found itself employed as Casseus head of research. What made the robot such an oddity was its possession of a soul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Eastly,&quot; Alpha repeated. &quot;Your work on the preliminary biomedical research is missing. Can you please submit an additional copy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eastly nodded, quickly bringing up the file on her laptop before printing the information. She didn&#39;t want to say anything, but she had not submitted it the first time. Casseus request was ignored at first, the doctor more focused on useing New Horizons advanced equipment to find a cure for her affliction.<br />
<br />
&quot;My apologies Alpha,&quot; Eastly sighed. &quot;Here&#39;s the preliminary notes. I still need to run further tests on the research. Genetic mutations are notoriousfor being difficultto cure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alpha simply nodded, scanning the documents before turning to Eastly. &quot;It appears you&#39;ve been using New Horizon resources to find a cure for your own genetic mutation.&quot;<br />
<br />
It’s not so much a mutation but a disease,” Eastly sighed. “A retro virus that leaves me trapped in a physical body of approximately ten years of age. It also alters the molecular structure of matter that comes into close proximity of my hemosyphoden dermarangolyn layer, effecting a transmutation….”<br />
<br />
She looked to see the Soul Drive’s confusion. “It alters any clothes I wear. You didn’t think I wear frilly tutus and bows of my own volition, did you?” She explained and showed the frilled poofy dress she was wearing under her equally frilly light pink lab coat. “It also acts as a powerful virophage, preventing me from contracting any illness but it also allows exponential growth of my telomeres—prevents me from aging. I’m stuck as a 10 year old girl, essentially immortal.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t humans wish for immortality?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like this.&quot; Eastly grumbled. &quot;But my mind is still formidable in the realm of bioengineering and genetics research, even with this body, I still have my wits and I&#39;m smarter than any elementary school student in this century.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alpha furrowed his brow. Company directives stated that personal projects would not be conducted on company time. Still, Casseus made an exception for Dr. Eastly. So long as she worked on the projects he assigned her. For the Soul Drive, he found Casseus willingness to break the rules for Dr. Eastly illogical.<br />
<br />
&quot;I once again must voice my disagreement with Mr. Casseus allowing you to conduct this research.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Alpha, Mr. Casseus approves.&quot; she retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as other projects for New Horizon are completed in a timely manner,&quot; Alpha pointed out. &quot;Please complete your assigned projects or I will be forced to contact Mr. Casseus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine grumbled, waving off the Soul Drive as she returned to her work. &quot;Fine, fine,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Is there anything else Alpha?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Chapman wished to see you,&quot; Alpha stated. &quot;There is something he wanted to show you. Something we have both been working on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine nodded, letting out a sigh as she hopped off her stool. Chances were Neil was working on an apology present. The holiday season proved to be difficult this year for Katherine, the grown down adult snapping at Neil for no reason. The fault wasn&#39;t even Neil&#39;s, it had been Katherine.<br />
<br />
Neil Chapman had been her friend and confident for decades. As Christmas approached this year, the elderly scientist gave Katherine a set of very comfortable pajamas. Unfortunately, considering Katherine was stuck in the body of a 10 year old girl, these pajamas were rather small.<br />
<br />
Katherine rolled her eyes as the pajamas as the lolita virus altered them to look cute and juvenile. Neil was aware that Katherine was hoping for a set of pajamas yet the the only thing that would fit were made for children. It crushed Neil, watching his best friend forced to live in perpetual childhood with the mind of an adult. Worse, Neil felt guilty, making Katherine feel worse. This situation wasn&#39;t his fault, it was hers. All her friend ever did was support her.<br />
<br />
As Katherine entered the lab Neil was working in, she raised an eyebrow. Currently Dr. Chapman was working within a chamber, making adjustments to a series of emitters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Eastly I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here,&quot; Neil smiled. &quot;I wanted to show you something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Katherine could ask, Neil hit a remote closing the chamber. As the emitter whirred to life, Katherine&#39;s eyes went wide. &quot;Neil what are you doing?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil Chapman simply smiled as Katherine gazed at her friend in shock. Already, the Lolita scientist could see visible changes in her friend. The grey hair on her his head slowly transforming back to brown, the deep wrinkles in his face smoothing, the scar on his face that had begun to fade slowly becoming more prominent before fading away. Dr. Neil Chapman was growing younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Chapman STOP,&quot; Katherine exclaimed. &quot;You&#39;re getting younger!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Katherine,&quot; a now 50 year old Neil replied. &quot;I just need you to trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine Eastly balked. Trust him? Already Neil was back in his mid 40s, the scar now fading away as he reached an age before the injury occurred. Why would he do this? It made no sense. Worse, it showed no sign of stopping.<br />
<br />
Dr. Chapman now exited his 40s, quickly descending through his 30s. Neil&#39;s physical gains within the kitsune realm were now a memory, the young man losing some of his muscular definition becoming thin. The grey in his hair now a healthy brown, his face angular and wrinkle free. Neil Chapman looked like a young college professor now, a skinny, intelligent, man who favored theoretical discussions over a night on the town. Katherine recalled those days when the pair worked together, she just didn&#39;t realize how cute he was.<br />
<br />
Still the regression continued, Neil hitting his 30th birthday in reverse and speeding past it. With every passing moment, Neil Chapman began to look more like a bookish college student than a veteran scientist. Neil&#39;s face appeared rounder, his eyes gleaming with youthful energy, his hair thicker appearing wild. In only moments Katherine found herself gawking at a skinny, bookish 20 year old.<br />
<br />
Now the changes truly began to take place as Dr. Chapman descended into his teens. The process was shocking for Dr. Eastly as Neil became 18 once again. The high school senior could best be described as willowy. Tall, lanky, with a boyish face and wild brown hair. Neil looked like he never lifted a weight in his life, the teenage boy hitching his loose slacks up to keep them from falling down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neil why are you doing this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll explain at the end,&quot; Dr. Chapman said, his voice breaking on the last word. Neil couldn&#39;t be more than 14 or 15 now, the lanky teen gradually decreasing in height as he relived puberty in reverse. The skinny science nerd looked like a freshman now, his height dropping drastically with each lost year. Obviously Neil was a bit surprised as his voice rose into a boyish soprano.<br />
<br />
Katherine could do little more than watch in stunned silence as Neil Chapman relived puberty in reverse. Dr. Chapman couldn&#39;t be more than 12 years old now, his face rounding, his body becoming skinnier and shorter. He looked like a mischievous 6th grader than 5th grader, looking like a intelligent if not mischievous boy with wild brown hair.<br />
<br />
As the emitter shut off, Katherine stared at the 10 year old boy now standing inside the chamber. Neil Chapman was a skinny boy now with a childish face. As the door to the chamber opened, Neil stepped outside, leaving his overly large shoes behind. Katherine finding the sight of his overly large socks flapping on the boys feet comical.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow this is surreal,&quot; Neil said in awe, before scrunching up his button nose in confusion. &quot;Geez is that what I sound like? I sound like I inhaled an entire canister of helium.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?!&quot; Katherine exclaimed, slugging the now elementary aged scientist in the shoulder. Neil winced, letting out a childish ow as he rubbed the sore spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;That hurt Katherine.&quot; he whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s supposed to,&quot; Katherine exclaimed. &quot;Why did you turn yourself into a kid?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I was tired of seeing you go through this alone!&quot; Neil exclaimed. Katherine was dumbstruck. He had done this for her?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about this for a while Katherine,&quot; Neil said softly, staring down at his feet. &quot;You&#39;ve been my best friend for decades and I hate watching you have to go through this alone. So, I used the Clean Slate chamber and adjusted it to make me 10 years old again. This way...you won&#39;t have to feel alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Eastly was speechless, part of her was furious that Neil would do something so dangerous yet another part was touched her frisnd would fo this far just to make her more comfortable. For a moment the pair of grown down scientists stood quiet before Dr. Eastly squeezed Dr. Chapman in a bear hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Neil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome Katherine,&quot; Dr. Chapman smiled. &quot;Now um...can we find me a change of clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them heard a door opening as the saw Mr. and Mrs. Casseus come into the lab.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chapman, Eastly, we wanted to see how you&#39;re....progressing.&quot; Casseus said as the two of them were surprised to see a now young Doctor Chapman standing next to the young Dr. Eastly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems like they&#39;re busy with regressing as of late, dear.&quot; Melissa said with a slight joke in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed. Chapman, do you still have your mind about you?&quot; Casseus asked looking at him directly in the eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Casseus, of course I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, then I want you to get back on progress. We have plans to finish and I don&#39;t wish either of you to squander your time.&quot; Casseus said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s let this one slide dear, it does seem he did it out of love for the young girl. Besides, he has done much for you recently and his research into getting me my own magic has been helpful, you said so yourself.&quot; Melissa said rubbing her husband&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you are right about that love. Whatever side project you two may have going, you may continue with it, but the Harris project comes first and foremost, understand?&quot; Casseus asked the two of them as they both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, come my dear, I believe we had a dinner date with the mayor and his wife. We don&#39;t want to keep them waiting.&quot; Casseus said as he and Melissa left the lab.</p>
