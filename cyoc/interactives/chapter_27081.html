<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still possessing his sensibilities, Walt padded his way out of the locker room.  taking one last moment, he stopped at the doorway and said goodbye to his life as a janitor.  His mind raced with thoughts of food, freedom, and sex.  He couldn't believe how alive he felt. <br />
<br />
He surveyed the area wondering how he could satisfy his new ursine urges.  He wanted companionship.  He wanted to fuck.  He wanted Briggs.<br />
<br />
Briggs was an old army buddy from Vietnam.  After the war they kept in touch.  Briggs had talked Walt down from more than one ledge when he was suicidal.  He saved his life.  It was now time for Walt to give a gift in return.<br />
<br />
Walt made his way across campus.  He caught wind of several other bears in the area.  Part of his mind wanted to stop and 'acquaint' himself with them.  Yet, he had a goal in mind already.  Focused, Walt made his way back home.  He lived close to campus.  Briggs had moved close by as well after one 'accident' that Walt had, in order to keep an eye on him. <br />
<br />
Finally arriving at Briggs house he noticed no lights on and his vehicle no in the drive way.  The garage door was open and Walt slipped inside.  With a furred hand he activated the garage door and it closed behind him.  Briggs would certainly be surprised to see him.<br />
<br />
Walt curled up in the corner of the free-standing garage and fell asleep.  He wasn't sure how long he had been out, but the sound of an engine woke him.  It was Briggs.<br />
<br />
Harlan Briggs was a true patriot.  Proudly serving his country in what seemed like a futile action.  Since taking his leave from the Army tried to maintain his physical condition.  Sporting a buzz cut and mustache that was starting to gray, he looked the part of a drill Sergent even more now than he did back then.<br />
<br />
Briggs stepped out of his Land Rover, wearing tattered Baylor t-shirt and camouflage pants.  He didn't recall closing his garage door.  Actually he knew he didn't.  Something was up.  Was there someone inside?  He could hear movement inside.<br />
<br />
He punched in the security code for the door and stepped around the corner out of sight.  He heard more rustling coming from inside.  &quot;Whoever you 're, just get the fuck outta here!&quot;  he shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Briggs...&quot;  Walt managed to growl out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said get on out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Walt, motherfucker,&quot; he could smell sweat on his army pal.  He must be back from working out at the gym.  He found it hard not to jump him right there.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't sound like Walt.  Just take your hobo ass and get out of my garage.&quot;  Briggs was not in the mood to fool around.  He stepped into the garage doorway and tried to look inside.  Not able to see much in the dark he moved back to his Land Rover and switched on the lights.<br />
<br />
The headlights blinded Walt's furry form for a moment.  He threw his arms up over his face.  &quot;Jesus H. Christ... what the hell is going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Walt's eyes become adjusted to the lights he slowly moved his paws away and said again.  &quot;God dammit, Briggs it me.  Walt.  I've known you long enough to know that you can't wait to twist one off after a workout.  I can smell your pre-cum from here.  You may have outranked me in Vietnam, but now I think it's my turn to pull rank on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That really is you?&quot;  Briggs turned off the lights and stepped into the garage, shutting the door behind him.  Closing the two of them inside.  Briggs was rubbing his cock through his pants.  He couldn't believe what he was seeing.  He couldn't believe what he was feeling.<br />
<br />
Walt continued.  &quot;I wanted to suck you off so often, but I couldn't bring myself to tell you.  Now I don't care.  I've never felt more alive and I know what you want.  I have something to give you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Screw pleasantries Walt, we've been friends for decades.  I've know all along how you felt.  Seeing you like this is almost too much for me.  You always were the weaker of the two of us, but my dream was that you'd be strong one day and admit what you felt.  Now you're strong in many other ways as well.&quot;  Briggs removed his shirt, his dog tags jingling around his neck.  He moved toward Walt and rubbed his hand through his furry chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at you, fucker.  You're a beast.  A bear of a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More bear than man!&quot;  Walt laughed deeply, pulling Briggs closer. <br />
<br />
Briggs reached down and grabbed Walt's dick.  &quot;That's fucking for sure.&quot;  Briggs pressed his lips against Walt's short muzzle.  They kissed passionate for quite some time. <br />
<br />
Walt began pawing at Briggs pants before finally just ripping them off exposing a sweat-soaked jock strap.  Getting down on all fours, Walt inhaled deeply the musky scent of his Army brother.  Lapping at the jock, Briggs managed to slip his hands down there and remove it.  Standing naked and erect before Walt, he wasn't sure how it would be, but he knew what was coming next.<br />
<br />
Walt spun Briggs around and pushed him up against the work bench.     His dick slicked with pre-cum he mounted Briggs without so much as a playful warning.  Briggs gritted his teeth and grunted, but would scream if his life depended on it.  He was a soldier.  He could take anything. <br />
<br />
As Walt pumped in and out Briggs the change began.  His buzz cut slowly fading away into hair over his entire head.  Spreading down his back, the dark follicles pushed their way out of his skin.  All the while Briggs braced himself against the wooden top of the work bench.  Soon dark nails began to dig into the wood as Briggs paws formed.  Fur spreading up his arms and connecting with the black mat of fur on his back and chest.  His salt and pepper mustache melted into a full peppered beard.  Graying around the temples and now rounded ears. <br />
<br />
As Walt shot his load into Briggs he felt the twitch of a tail against his belly.  Brigg's tail.<br />
<br />
Walt pulled out and stepped back to admire his friends new bear body.  Black with fine traces of gray here and there.  He had decreased in age slightly it seemed, but retained some maturity in various ways.  Walt couldn't be happier... Or could he?<br />
<br />
Briggs ran his paws across his chest.  Snagging a claw on his dog tags.  Briggs moved toward Walt, grabbing his bear-lover by the waist.  &quot;Now lets see if you can take order as well as you can give them.&quot;</p>
