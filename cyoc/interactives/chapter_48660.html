<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few days pass uneventfully, you don't use the light again on yourself, or anyone else and after the two days, the fact that your family is all female doesn't really seem that exceptional. Your father and little brother act more or less the same despite the gender change and no one notices anything strange, so it's easy for you to more or less forget about what you've done. Even with your gender changed, you find that it feels normal. You still dress and act exactly the same, though that may be doe to the fact that since you used the light, you're unaffected by its ability to make people not realize they've been changed.<br />
<br />
Being a girl feels normal and natural enough that by now you really don't think about it at all. Sitting down to go to the bathroom, looking in the mirror and seeing your breasts, even when you shower and clean between your legs, nothing feels strange. Though your intention was initially to stay a girl until you got some lesbian action going on with your girlfriend, you realize that the fact you still have three more days to wait before her work schedule will allow you two to have time together, you're not at all upset about the wait. You could have changed yourself back to a guy at any time, but now when you think about it, you find yourself wondering if you might not want to spend a bit more time as a girl even after your date. Your recollection of being a guy is clear enough, and though you still dress and act like a guy, you find the thought of how you used to be a bit strange, like you once imagined it would be to be a girl.<br />
<br />
Recalling the feeling of what it was like to have a cock and balls you marvel at how you ever managed to ignore the weight and motion of something like that. Just thinking about it is enough to make you feel strange, like having something like that would be impossible to get used to, despite you having lived your whole life, save for the past few days, with it. Then when you think about what you and your girlfriend would do... You're still into girls and not at all attracted to guys, and now when you think about the way you used to have sex, you cannot help consider what it would be like to have someone enter you, seeing your pussy being penetrated instead of your girlfriend's. That thought does make you shudder, you'd feel violated to have someone do that to you, and though your girlfriend has no recollection of such things, thanks to the alterations to reality, you feel bad about having done so with her, especially now that you have a greater appreciation for female anatomy.<br />
<br />
You don't have much time to think about such things today though, since you're taking Lucy, your little sister, to the mall for a party with her friends. They'll be about twelve or so little twerps getting together total, to go to the 'Build-a-Bear' workshop to make stuffed animals, and since both your parents are working, you're stuck helping supervise.<br />
<br />
The trip there is easy enough, since Lucy spends the whole ride talking about the sort of stuffed animal she wants to make, which though boring, means that she's not running all over the place and forcing you to chase her.<br />
<br />
Once the bus stops you have to grab her before she sprints away, but other than that she's remarkably well behaved, possibly because you promised her that if she was good you'd get her a new pack of pokemon cards and if she was especially good, you might even play pokemon with her once you got home. In your experience, bribery worked very well back when she was 'Luke' and it still works now. If she had lost her interest in pokemon when she became a girl you have no idea what you'd do to keep her in line.<br />
<br />
Once you get her to the toy store where the party is, you see that enough parents have come with the kids that you can sort of take it easy and people watch. You brought the flashlight just in case something like that were to happen, so you're ready to have your own fun while Lucy and her friends have theirs.<br />
<br />
While you're sitting on a bench near the toy store, wondering what you want to do, someone calls your name.<br />
<br />
It takes you a second to realize who's talking to you, especially when you see a gorgeous girl waving at you. When you see that the girl is not alone, that next to her is another girl who you recognize as Melissa, you recognize Gene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hi!&quot; you wave to him, remembering that because he still has his junk, diminished as it is, he still considers himself a guy even though he acts like a total girl, &quot;How's it going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; he giggles and comes to sit down next to you. He looks just like a girl, enough so that even though you know he's really your best, male, friend, you cannot help but stare. This only makes him giggle even more as he puts an arm around you, &quot;You're staring at me again dude. I thought you weren't into guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa sits down next to him and snuggles up against him and you start to laugh, &quot;Would you feel better if I were to stare at Melissa then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She,&quot; Gene says, smiling and patting her on the leg with an elegantly manicured hand, &quot;Isn't into girls, right Melissa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it's Melissa's turn to giggle as she winks at you, &quot;I don't know Gene, she dresses and acts enough like a guy that I might be tempted to try something different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gene makes a show of pouting, his full lips bowed up in a cute little frown and his long lashes fluttering as he crosses his arms over his full yet perky breasts, &quot;Oh Melissa, I'm hurt! I thought you liked the way I dressed and that I didn't act like all the other guys you've met. Do you want me to stop wearing makeup, cut my hair short and start wearing baggy shirts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And cover up a body like that?&quot; Melissa feigns horror, &quot;That would be a crime! I mean I wish I could get away with wearing outfits like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
You think about that comment for a minute. Melissa is pretty enough, but not quite the knockout that Gene is and you could set the flashlight to its highest pink setting to make her look even more attractive, but do you want to just yet?<br />
<br />
Just then one of the parents from the party, a woman whose name you can't remember, comes up to you, &quot;Have you seen Melissa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Gene looks confused, &quot;She's right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Recalling Lucy talking about her friends, you clear up the matter, &quot;No, it's a different Melissa Gene, one of my little sister's friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Gene lets out an embarrassed giggle, blushing furiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she have blond pigtails and a yellow shirt with some sort of cartoon character on it?&quot; Melissa asks, &quot;Because I saw her going into the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
The concerned woman nods, looking relieved, &quot;Yes, that's her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; you offer, &quot;I'll go get her.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you say this, you decide what sort of fun you're going to have with the flashlight, and in the process clear up that bit of name confusion that happened.<br />
<br />
When you get to the bathroom you see that little girl Melissa is washing her hands. Under the guise of letting the others know you found her, you take out the flashlight, which you have set to almost its highest intensity of blue and flick it on and off a few times like you're trying to get their attention.<br />
<br />
Once they're all looking at you, you give a thumbs up to them and go back to get little girl Melissa, none of the others having realized that each time you flicked the light on, you let the beam hit Gene's girlfriend.<br />
<br />
After bringing the little girl back to the party, you go back to sit down with Gene and his Melissa to see what you managed to do.<br />
<br />
What you see causes you to fight back a laugh, you got Melissa pretty good across the neck and again at her stomach, but nowhere else, meaning that top, which once revealed her flat, tanned stomach, now reveals six-pack abs and a trail of hair that originates from somewhere beneath her skirt. She also has an Adam's apple, but you fail to notice it until she speaks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crisis averted,&quot; she laughs, her voice deep and masculine, &quot;Good thing one of us was paying attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now your challenge is to figure out how to get the rest of her.<br />
<br />
Then she turns to you with an obviously faked frown, &quot;And what were you laughing at?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh,&quot; inspiration strikes you, &quot;Let me try and shed some light on the matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a terrible joke, but it gives you the excuse to turn on the light and shine it on Melissa's arms upper body, stopping just short of her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;This?&quot; She stands up and flexes her now hairy, muscular arms, smiling at you all the while. You can also see the muscles of her chest through her shirt, which has become a fairly tight fitting, very masculine t-shirt, &quot;What's so funny about the fact that I like working out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she laughs and sits back down, smoothing her skirt into place, with her large, masculine hands.<br />
<br />
Hoping you're not taking things too far, you keep going with the joke, &quot;I can appreciate wanting to be muscular and all, but you've got the arms and upper body of a guy, right down to the voice and body hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Gene smiles seductively, &quot;I like my women natural rather than some waxed Barbie doll bimbo. There's nothing wrong with a little body hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
You wouldn't call what Melissa has 'a little body hair', but that's not really the point. Pressing your luck, you keep going, turning the light on and shining it on her face and hair this time, &quot;Working out's fine, but keep it up and you'll have to shave, unless Gene likes his women to have full beards too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her hair becomes short, gelled into a messy, spiked style, and her face does indeed become as masculine as her torso, right down to sideburns and a trace of stubble.<br />
<br />
Luckily she takes this in stride, &quot;Alright, alright, you caught me. I didn't shave this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
With only her lower body left to go, the rest is easy, you change the subject, but keep laughing and joking so that neither of them notices when you shine the light on Melissa's feet and start working your way up her legs. For a moment you consider leaving the anatomy between her legs alone, then decide against it. You want to see what it'll be like for Gene to be dating an actual guy.<br />
<br />
After the change is complete you notice that the conversation has changed a bit. You and Melissa are talking about her workout routine, sports, and other things you consider typical male conversation topics and Gene is starting to look bored. Finally he sighs, &quot;Come on Mel, you promised you'd take me shoe shopping!&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa, who you realize is fully a guy, so Mel is a more proper name, laughs, &quot;You tricked me! You said you were going bra shopping and that I'd get to help you pick them out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't lie,&quot; Gene gives Mel a hug, &quot;I said I wanted to go shoe shopping and afterwards you could help me pick out a new bra. There are still two more shoe stores to go, but if you don't want to keep shopping, I guess I can go without a new bra. Maybe we can just go back to your place and have a bit of fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel returns the hug, and to your surprise actually gives Gene's round, feminine butt a squeeze, &quot;You know I can't do that today. I've got to help my mom move some stuff out of the garage. She's been my case about it for weeks now and if I don't get it done I'll never hear the end of it. I swear sometimes it's just like you're a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh alright,&quot; Gene pouts, &quot;I guess I can forget about shoe shopping for today, we might as well leave now and then maybe you can take your time driving me home. And I'm not just like a woman, there's a very important difference, otherwise you wouldn't be dating me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Giggling, Gene brushes a hand across his skirt as though trying to emphasize something, but what you can't see.<br />
<br />
They then say their goodbyes to you and walk off, leaving you alone to think about what you've done.<br />
<br />
Gene is in the same state you left him in several days ago with nothing left of his previous male body other than the anatomy between his legs, which you have the feeling is downright minuscule. He acts just like a girl, and now his girlfriend is a guy and acts like one, or at least for the most part he acts like one. Based on what he said, he's interested in guys, or maybe just Gene. The way the flashlight works to change reality makes it hard to figure things like that out.</p>
