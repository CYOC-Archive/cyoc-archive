<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Still backtracking to a few hours before supper time.<br />
<br />
Benton watches as his daughter come home followed by Spencer and Eric. The three teens looking happy as they had a fun day with Ester and Rick’s cubs; Frieda quickly gave her father a brief rundown over their enjoyable time at the Rec Center. Unable to resist; Benton chuckles as he can see underneath Frieda’s clothes the provocative bikini she is still wearing. Knowing what was about to happen as Eric and Spencer were already in their respective fursonas; giving off lustful toothy grins from their muzzles. Eric’s were-panther tail twitching a flailing; while Spencer’s tail wags more like that of a wolf, despite looking almost feline.<br />
<br />
Spencer was a hybrid were; werewolf from her father, while were-panther/feline from her mother. Spencer’s fur just as black as her father’s, yet with green eyes as piercing as Eric’s and Frieda’s. Spencer looks at Eric and purrs; Eric a pure white were-panther, with just a light hint of brown fur on the top of his head. Eric was in fact the only white furred were-panther in all of Moon Lake; perhaps in the world its self. Yet that uniqueness did not concern him; he was happy to be with his mates; Spencer and Frieda.<br />
<br />
Benton sensing that he was delaying what is going to be another of the teens “special” moments together; shakes his were-panther head in bemusement as he finishes hugging his daughter. Letting her go as she heads upstairs with Eric and Spencer quickly in tow. Sighing as he looks at Amanda who rolls her eyes also bemused. Both parents have come after the months of Frieda’s friends coming over, to accept Frieda’s lifestyle choice. While they themselves have never understood why their daughter is bisexual and that she is in a relationship with both a boy and a girl, and that said boy and girl are in a relationship with Frieda as well. Both Benton and Amanda do know, that their daughter has never been happier; as a result their relationship with Frieda has improved.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
In Frieda’s room; two eager were’s stare at a red haired girl with a black and white bikini containing and covering her intimate areas. Eric gives off a pleasant growl as he places his paws on Frieda’s breasts, barely contained in the black top.<br />
“It’s easier to get at my warm soft pillows,” Frieda encouraging the white furred were-panther; “if you untie the knot in the back.”<br />
Heading to stand behind Frieda; Eric still keeps his paws on Frieda’s breasts. But using his muzzle, he pulls the string apart with his teeth. The Black top soon falls off; yet Eric still has his paws covering Frieda’s breast. Purring, he slowly kneads and massages them all the while whispering in Frieda’s ear.<br />
“Don’t shift just yet,” Eric chuckling; “Spencer gets to undo your bottom now.”<br />
<br />
Spencer licks her lips as she approaches Frieda from the front; bending down to stare at the white stretchy fabric covering Frieda’s bottom, Spencer uses her paws to deftly undo the bikini bottom strings. Exposing Frieda’s thick red haired pubic bush; her sex glistening as her arousal is present. Spencer grins as Frieda moans to Eric’s gentle massaging; her eyes closed, Frieda doesn’t see Spencer licking Frieda’s folds but she feels it and makes a definite happy yowl.<br />
“Hold on shifting,” Eric whispering in Frieda’s ear; “Spencer is about to begin.”<br />
<br />
Spencer gives Frieda’s sex a few more lick before driving her lounge deep into the aroused folds; this elicits more yowls from Frieda as she struggles to hold back the panther within her from coming out. Feeling Eric’s retractable claws gently dig in and tickle Frieda’s nipples as they stand erect and stiff from the pleasure she is receiving.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before Frieda’s yowls again; only this time form the orgasmic release of being doubled teamed by her lovers. Her were-panther fursona exploding forth as her grey fur with russet highlights covers her skin rapidly; her tail shooting out and thrashing violently with orgasmic pleasure. Frieda’s body growing in height and muscle mass as her legs and feet shift and morph into a digitigrade stance befitting and anthropomorphized panther. Frieda’s head shifting into a more feline form, her mouth and nose merging into a muzzle with whiskers sprouting forth; her ears travelling and migrating to the top of her head and they change shape and muscles form allowing Frieda to swivel and move them like a regular panther can. Barely able to stand on her paws due to the orgasmic rush Eric and Spencer brought Frieda to; she is guided to her bed to sit down as she happily comes down from her heady rush of pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Oh you two,” Frieda panting; “if you don’t beat all, that was thrilling.”<br />
“That’s what you get,” Eric tapping at the terrarium in Frieda’s room trying to get the rat snakes attention; “for wearing such a sexy bikini.”<br />
<br />
“Stop tormenting Ralph,” Frieda looking at Eric staring at the pet he and Spencer got her for Christmas. When she opened the box from Eric and Spencer to see the live snake; Amanda freaked out at seeing the scaly creature. Going so far as to leap onto a chair as if she saw a mouse running around the floor; Benton had a good laugh at seeing his wife a were-panther afraid of a small creature that is more scared of her then she is of it. Amanda of course refused to get down until after the snake was properly covered and hidden from her sight. Getting the terrarium in which Frieda’s pet calls home; Eric gently removes it from the glass enclosure and places it next to Frieda on her bed.<br />
“When was the last time you fed Ralph,” Eric watching the snake flick its forked tongue back and forth.<br />
A few days ago,” Frieda answering as she allows the snake to crawl on her; “although we do need to catch more mice for him.”<br />
“Just as long as Eric doesn’t make a snack out of the some we catch,” Spencer speaking as she admires the shiny scales on the pet she and Eric got for Frieda; I don’t get how you acquired a taste for eating live mice.”<br />
“I told you before,” Eric chuckling; “blame my dad. I see him popping the little critters in his maw swallowing them in one gulp. He dared me I couldn’t do it,” Eric smiling; “dad lost the bet and thanks to him, I find the feel if the little buggers struggling as travel down my esophagus enjoyable.”<br />
“You know those little blighters are carriers of a whole host of diseases,” Spencer blanching; “plus parasites.”<br />
“We are immune to those diseases,” Eric speaking; “when was the last time a were died from Huntington’s disease or the bubonic plague?”<br />
“Well don’t expect I or Spencer,” Frieda picking up her pet snake and placing it back in the terrarium; “ too give you a flea or tick bath. You’re on your own if that happens,” Frieda sticking out her tongue.<br />
“We are more likely to get a tick on us from our wild runs in the woods,” Eric answering; then from enjoying a mouse snack. And besides,” Eric grinning; “I thought you’d revel at the chance to get me wet, we did have fun at the Rec Center. And fleas are more likely to found on rats,” Eric grinning; “not mice.”</p>
