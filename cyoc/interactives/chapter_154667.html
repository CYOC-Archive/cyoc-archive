<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diego had to focus extra hard to not paw at himself as he walked down the street thinking about Dr. Andrews. A feat that was easier said than done, as his prodigious basket swayed inches side to side as he took plodding steps down the sidewalk, his titanic thighs straining his oversized basketball shorts that barely looked like a pair of booty shorts on him these days. Even other contagion-infected people would gawk and move out of the way as he made his way deliberately to Dr. Andrews&#39; gated community.<br />
<br />
With the gates closed, Diego waddled up to the guard&#39;s station. The portly man inside jaws dropped as he looked down from his window at a man that was almost as wide as he was tall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, buddy, think you could let me in? I need to see my doctor. Special house call,&quot; Diego boomed, the young stud flexing his tanned, musclebound arms for the guard. A rosy blush crossed the guard&#39;s chubby cheeks but he just shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t,&quot; the guard blubbered, clearly flustered. Diego didn&#39;t want to have to do this but...<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make it worth your while,&quot; Diego chuckled mischievously. He turned to the side, giving the man a view of insane chest and arm. He slowly brought his arm up and let the guard see just how incredibly stacked he was. He was able to barely get the arm past a 90 degree bend, thanks to gaining some of his mobility back. But that did nothing to diminish how amazingly built the 18-year-old muscle monster was. &quot;Wish I could show you how awesome all this muscle feels,&quot; Diego huffed, a vein snaking along his temple as he flexed harder, really putting effort into impressing the chubby guard inside the station. He tried to bring his other arm to touch the mountainous peak of his flexed bicep, but his chest, lats and arms were simply still way too developed to make that motion. No matter though, the guard saw the effort and was no doubt seriously thinking about taking up Diego&#39;s offer.<br />
<br />
The portly man jumped, as best he could, out of his seat and opened the door. Like Diego, he too had to waddle as he walked, but for a completely different reason. Diego smirked as the fat guard panted, holding onto the side of the brick building he just came out of. The guy whimpered as he played with what looked like a tiny bump in his trousers, the poor thing surrounded by fat, barely visible -- unlike the young god&#39;s, which made itself very well known, bulging inches in front of Diego&#39;s crotch, the thing carving out a hill several inches, even pulling at the band of his strained shorts, even when he was completely flaccid.<br />
<br />
Diego brought both his arms up and growled lowly as he tensed his arms, giving his chubby admirer a fantastic view of just how much muscle he had managed to put onto his 5&#39;5&quot; frame. The other man couldn&#39;t resist, coming up and feeling Diego&#39;s superior physique, his fingers trembling along the lightly furred surface of Diego&#39;s tanned arms. The huge high school senior snickered as the man put his hand in between his giant pecs. He squeezed his chest together and trapped the guard&#39;s fingers in between the slabs of meat. The guard moaned lewdly and Diego was pretty sure he was cumming in his uniform again. Heh, pathetic.<br />
<br />
Diego moved from pose to pose, really letting the man get a feel of gargantuan form. The guard&#39;s hands moved from his biceps, to feel up the shortstack&#39;s huge horseshoe triceps, down his hairy, corded and grotesquely veined forearms. He roamed over the boulder-like deltoids and worshiped Diego&#39;s expansive back. As he did so, Diego almost laughed when he felt the Tootsie Roll that was poking out from the guard&#39;s  crotch into the small of his back as his hands moved along Diego&#39;s lats and traps. Diego groaned lowly as the man&#39;s light touch praised his blown out musclegut, his hand going underneath the young titan&#39;s shirt to feel up the cobblestone-like muscle underneath the tortured shirt. Diego&#39;s body felt like a furnace against his pallid skin.<br />
<br />
Diego didn&#39;t realize just how into this he was getting. He brought his arms behind his head. Or at least he tried to. In his current state, the fireplug of a teen could at most bring both his arms above his head and slightly bend his elbows. It was then that he realized that he was rock hard in his shorts. He felt the guard&#39;s fingers circle around the tip of his cockhead through the fabric of his shorts. The teen-beast pulled away and dropped his pose, his hands shooting down to cover what little they could of his indecency. Diego grunted, unprepared for his massive chest to knock into his chin when he jerked with such a sudden motion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, man. Got a little carried away. Think you can let me in now?&quot; Diego coughed as he struggled to pull the band of his shorts higher up along his prodigious shaft. The guard looked a little disappointed, but nodded, making his way back into his station and opening the gate for Diego.<br />
<br />
As the hulking teen swaggered into the gated community, he didn&#39;t turn back to see the guard was looking at the thin film of pre-seed on his fingers. Without trepidation, the man brought his fingers to his lips and savored the salty flavor of what Diego had to offer.<br />
<br />
Diego made his way to the doctor&#39;s place, practically a small mansion. And he was lucky enough to see the doctor&#39;s car was still in the driveway. However, he realized as soon as the door opened that the car was probably not making a lot of trips out of the driveway these days.<br />
<br />
Diego&#39;s eyes jumped when he saw a massive figure squeeze his way out of the front door. Dr. Andrews had really taken well to the contagion it had seemed. And Diego&#39;s suspicions were correct that the man had continued to grow. A few weeks back, the older doctor had evolved into a musclebound freak like he had, only the doctor was pushing a skyscraping 7&#39; back then. But now, the man was even taller, even broader and more densely muscled. Diego&#39;s cock ripped right out his shorts, the garment falling uselessly onto the stone driveway. Dr. Andrews had to be pushing 7&#39;4&quot; now, gaining a couple inches in height every week. And Diego couldn&#39;t believe how built the man was. Even in his custom-tailored dress shirt, the man&#39;s arms were practically splayed out to the side at almost 30 degrees thanks to how severely overmuscled he had become. Diego realized that two of him side by side might not be enough to match the humongous doctor&#39;s width now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Diego?&quot; Dr. Andrews grunted, raising a brow. His voice was so deep, it was felt more than it was heard. The titanic doctor&#39;s shoulders slumped as he saw the mess Diego had made on his driveway. He groaned lowly as he turned to go back inside. &quot;Hold on, I&#39;ll get you some pants I had made for me when I was tiny that might fit.&quot; Watching the humongous freak of a doctor enter his house, struggling to squeeze all that mass through the door was such a turn on. And when Dr. Andrews returned, Diego groaned and spewed another load of pre onto Dr. Andrews&#39;s lawn as he saw wisps of plaster and concrete, and an audible crack rang through the air as the doorframe nearly failed as a beast of a man tried to squeezed through.<br />
<br />
The massive man presented Diego with a pair of pants. So this is what the doctor considered &#39;tiny?&#39; The legs of the pants were definitely too long, but the most obvious mismatch... was the humongous pouch in the crotch that draped unflatteringly on Diego&#39;s &#39;tiny&#39; frame. Dr. Andrews chuckled a little bit but blushed when Diego turned to him. &quot;Sorry, it&#39;s the best I could do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-it&#39;s okay, sir,&quot; Diego whimpered. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here, Diego?&quot; Dr. Andrews asked as he walked away from his house, the ground shuddering with each step. Diego flashed a confused look as he struggled to keep up with the giant&#39;s long strides, almost having to speed-waddle just to keep up. He looked at Dr. Andrews and then at his car. Wasn&#39;t he going to use it to get to work? As if sensing the question coming, Dr. Andrews spoke up. &quot;Haven&#39;t been able to fit in that thing in a while. Besides, walking is good for the body.&quot; To prove a point, the huge doctor bounced his chest. A loud ping rang through the morning air and the giant cursed as the top of his humongous pectorals spilled out. Diego&#39;s tongue almost wagged when he saw the dense salt-and-pepper body hair covering the huge mounds of muscle. &quot;S-sorry, I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-it&#39;s okay,&quot; Diego gulped. The doctor flashed him a look, urging him to explain himself. &quot;Well, you see, sir. I was hoping you could check me out.&quot; The young fireplug was hoping the doctor caught the innuendo. But the look of disdain and the low, disappointed rumble coming from Dr. Andrews&#39;s chest confirmed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Diego, no. And besides, you aren&#39;t scheduled for an appointment for another 2 weeks. Come to my office then,&quot; the titanic physician growled lowly. The humongous man paused in his tracks and swung one huge leg over the other to turn to Diego. He had to intentionally bend over just to see the shortstack over his massive pec shelf, his weathered eyes piercing into the high school senior hulk&#39;s. &quot;Well, if you ask me, I&#39;m glad that you&#39;ve tapered off. You don&#39;t seem to have grown much since the last time I saw you.&quot; With that the giant older man continued his walk towards the front gate.<br />
<br />
Diego just stood there for a moment, stunned, his cock twitching in his borrowed pants. He felt a mix of emotions wash over him and he didn&#39;t know what he should feel more of: insulted or turned on. Dr. Andrews was now so large, so overwhelmingly built that he didn&#39;t even realize that Diego had put on an inch in height and 25 pounds of muscle since the last time he saw him. He huffed as he picked up his pace to catch up to the only man he&#39;d met that was more impressive than himself.<br />
<br />
It was clear to him that at his current state, he couldn&#39;t seduce the doctor. It was evident that the doctor had grown so inordinately huge that he saw Diego as nothing more than one of his &#39;tiny&#39; patients. He&#39;d workout harder, train with more intensity, push his body to its limit, stimulate his contagion until it could give no more.<br />
<br />
Dr. Andrews stood at the gate. &quot;Roger, open the gate,&quot; the giant doctor ordered. After calling for the guard again, he tried to cross his arms, only succeeding in tearing another seam loose on his shirt. &quot;Typical, he&#39;s probably sleeping again.&quot; Dr. Andrews turned to Diego, beckoning the smaller guy over. Diego flashed with excitement for a second, but that came to an end when the doctor picked him up with one hand and tucked him underneath his arm.<br />
<br />
Diego couldn&#39;t believe it when he heard the stitching on Dr. Andrew&#39;s pants pull apart as he tensed his legs. The next moment, they were soaring through the air. A small earthquake shook nearby trees and car alarms went off as Dr. Andrews landed, the huge beast having jumped over the gate. The huge doc let Diego down, the young stud pitching an obvious tent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to school, Diego,&quot; the doctor said sternly, brushing off his shirt&#39;s cuff as the dust settled after his hulking feat of strength. As the doctor turned to leave, his muscled ass threatening to burst through his trousers, Diego made a vow... He&#39;d get so huge, Dr. Andrews wouldn&#39;t be able to ignore him like this! Diego tugged at himself, groaning as he began to nut into the oversized pants the doctor had given him, his copious amounts of seed getting lost in the ample folds of fabric.<br />
<br />
As Diego was stewing in how he would get back at Dr. Andrews for this indignity, he didn&#39;t once turn around to look at the guard stationed at the gate. Roger, the pudgy guard, was leaned back in his chair. Beads of sweat poured off his brow. After worshiping that kid and licking up the young guy&#39;s pre, he&#39;d suddenly gotten very hot under the collar, almost feeling like he&#39;d caught the flu. Well... one that turned him on so much he couldn&#39;t help but jerk his small cock off furiously, loud slaps ringing through his small station as his hand hit his fatty upper pelvic region with wanton abandon...</p>
