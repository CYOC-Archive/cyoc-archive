<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Miko&#39;s measurements were taken, the <i>Velociraptor </i> twins told her that they had something ready-made that will fit her. After dashing off for a bit, they returned with some clothes for her. Miko found that the underwear they provided fitted nicely. She was a bit surprised that they had a bra that would fit her much larger breasts, but pretty much every if not all female Animalians were well-endowed. However, the rest of the clothes didn&#39;t quite fit right. The sky blue tank top was stretched out a lot by her new rack, which created a plunging cleavage as well as pulling up the shirt so that her lower sets of abs were revealed. The black bike shorts were a bit snugger, particularly against her thicker, yet curvier legs.<br />
<br />
Sora looked at the dressed Miko before saying, &quot;I guess we didn&#39;t consider the elasticity enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can get you something that will fit better,&quot; said Yuki.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no immediate rush,&quot; said Miko as she looked at her reflection. She wasn&#39;t a particularly vain woman. When she had been in her actual 20&#39;s, she had a wispy build like many Asian women. Back then, she had considered the overabundant curves on white women to be ungainly. But as the interest in the female figure shifted, Miko started to envy white women&#39;s curves. Now she had curves that could overshadow just about any woman, white or Asian.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got stuff at our studio at the modeling school you can wear,&quot; said Sora.<br />
<br />
&quot;Modeling school?&quot; asked Miko with interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just yet,&quot; said Maho, &quot;The scientists wanted to check something with Miko first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miko&#39;s stomach growled a bit and she asked, &quot;Can it be after lunch? The transformation made me hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maho smiled and said, &quot;Funny you should mention that...&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The debate of the oviraptorosaurs&#39; diet has existed ever since the first <i>Oviraptor</i> fossil was discovered near a nest of eggs. Paleontologists first assumed that the eggs had belonged to a <i>Protoceratops</i> and that the <i>Oviraptor</i> was intending to eat them, hence being named &quot;egg-thief&quot;. It has since been determined that those eggs were the <i>Oviraptor</i>&#39;s own and it had died while brooding on its nest. After that, the debate has been ongoing whether <i>Oviraptor</i> and its closer relatives ate eggs or not. Other possible foods it could have ate included fibrous plants, hard nuts, shellfish, or smaller dinosaurs. There has been evidence proving whether one diet was more valid than the other.<br />
<br />
Dr. Stein and Rex were waiting in an observation room. The room which was normally reserved for people converting now had a table laden with many different kinds of food. There were steamed crab claws, boiled lobster tails, oysters still in their shells, drumsticks, coconuts, walnuts, corn on the cob, sugarcane, bamboo husks stuffed with fried rice, and of course, eggs. There were half a dozen deviled eggs from normal chicken and one large boiled egg from a chicken Animalian.<br />
<br />
&quot;This test should determine the preferred diet of a <i>Gigantoraptor</i>,&quot; said Rex, &quot;And by extension, the diets of other oviraptorosaurs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the door in the other room opened and Miko went in, looking confused. But then she saw all the food on the table and said, &quot;A buffet! Oh, if only I brought my purse with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
After Sora translated for them, Dr. Stein pressed a button on the intercom and said, &quot;It&#39;s free.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a trilling squawk of joy, excitement, and hunger from Miko before she eagerly started devouring the food. &quot;Huh, she must have been hungrier than she looked,&quot; said Sora.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After lunch was finished, it was determined that Miko was still an omnivore, her beak being equally adept at cracking open shells of both shellfish and nuts. Regarding eggs, Miko didn&#39;t feel particularly drawn to them more than the other foods. It was suspected that while oviraptorosaurs could steal and eat the eggs of other dinosaurs, it wasn&#39;t the primary staple of their diet. Miko was a bit relieved she wouldn&#39;t be constricted too much with her diet, asides from not eating artificial foods and things that would be toxic to animals.<br />
<br />
As she and the raptor twins were walking to the Animalian School of Modeling, Miko was rubbing her belly and saying, &quot;I&#39;m hoping the lunch I had won&#39;t ruin my figure.&quot; She was marveling in how detailed her abdominal muscles were now.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would take more than one buffet to ruin that figure,&quot; said Yuki.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you shouldn&#39;t be complacent,&quot; said Sora, &quot;Heather wasn&#39;t as careful with her body and eventually needed to work off the pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose I have enough time on my hands,&quot; said Miko, though now she was sounding uncertain. She hadn&#39;t thought ahead to what she wanted to do with her life after her conversion.<br />
<br />
Before long, the trio of raptors arrived at the modeling school. Miko was pleased to see that the front doors were tall enough to walk through without stooping. Though because there were giraffe models here, that wasn&#39;t hard to believe.<br />
<br />
Maggie had been working on her schedule calendar when the three dinosaurs. &quot;Yuki, Sora, nice seeing you,&quot; said Maggie before looking up at Miko, &quot;Who&#39;s your tall friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Miko Monaka,&quot; said Yuki, &quot;She&#39;s been freshly converted from Project Dinotopia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that,&quot; said Maggie, &quot;So what is she? Some kind of <i>Struthiomimus</i> or a giant <i>Oviraptor</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Gigantoraptor</i>,&quot; said Miko, able to understand a bit of what Maggie was saying, &quot;<i>Oviraptor</i>&#39;s biggest...cousin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her English isn&#39;t quite so good yet,&quot; said Sora, &quot;She&#39;ll need to work on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll pick it up quickly,&quot; said Maggie, &quot;She&#39;s like the great-great-grandmother of parrots now, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think birds are descended more from our type of theropod,&quot; said Yuki.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, why bring her here?&quot; asked Maggie.<br />
<br />
&quot;She wanted more clothes so we&#39;re taking her to our studio,&quot; said Sora. The girls have been apprenticing with tailors so they could become fashion designers. While fashion designing wasn&#39;t something that was directly taught at the school, working here gave the modeling students new outfits to try on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, but first, I want to ask Miko a few things. Would you mind acting as interpreters?&quot; asked Maggie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; said both Yuki and Sora.<br />
<br />
Then Maggie addressed Miko, &quot;So, have you given thought to what kind of work you&#39;ll be doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I admit that I didn&#39;t think of what I&#39;ll be doing after I converted,&quot; said Miko.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was your past job?&quot; asked Maggie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was really just a housewife,&quot; said Miko, &quot;I didn&#39;t really need to learn a trade before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you considered modeling? You have a good body for it,&quot; said Maggie.<br />
<br />
&quot;All Animalians do, don&#39;t they?&quot; asked Miko pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but not all have the grace or inclination to use it,&quot; said Maggie, &quot;But I see potential in you. We don&#39;t have any Dinotopians signing up right now, but you could be a trendsetter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Me? But my color is so...drab,&quot; said Miko, indicating her faded tan feathers and scales.<br />
<br />
&quot;So? You don&#39;t have to be a peacock around here,&quot; said Maggie, &quot;Your clothes will be enough color for you and I don&#39;t think anyone would complain about your skin. I&#39;m not saying you have to sign in immediately. Maybe when you&#39;ve got a better grasp of English.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miko thought it over and said, &quot;I think I would like to be a model, if I can be taught.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you can,&quot; said Maggie, &quot;I haven&#39;t met anyone here yet who doesn&#39;t have the brains to learn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miko wasn&#39;t sure if she was smiling with her beak, but she was certain she was. Life in America was going to be more exciting than she thought.</p>
