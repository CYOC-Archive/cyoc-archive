<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zack is surprised to see how dark it’s gotten outside. What was supposed to be a quick look into this Chronovac thing must have eaten up hours of his Friday night. That app was a dud.<br />
<br />
“Damn.” Zack curses under his breath as he walks down the dimly lit city street, peering at his phone as the digital clock shown it was just passed midnight. It’s too late to call his friends up to hang out now, the only thing that could salvage his Friday night now is his go-to snack and an evening full of Fortnite matches.<br />
<br />
The neighborhood 7/11’s electric sign shows like a beacon across the dark street just a block away, beckoning Zack to come and buy his comfort food. On this cool, moonless night the air is damp with freshly fallen rain as Zack splashes through puddles collected on the sidewalk. It’s all a normal winter evening for Zack, until suddenly he trips over something small standing in his way, camouflaged in the dark night.<br />
<br />
“Fuk-!” Zack gasps, tumbling as to not crush the careless critter that just jumped in front of him as he topples prone to the ground. He hits the sidewalk with a “splash” his jeans and hoodie soaked in ice cold rainwater as the 12-year-old shivers his way back up to his knees. He’s ready to curse his luck one more time until he feels something draw his attention away from his bad luck - something stroke along his wet jeans.<br />
<br />
The smell hits him first, the hairs on Zack’s neck standing on edge as he heard the pitter-patter of tiny paws struts alongside him in the sidewalk puddle. The boy gasps out a terrified huff as he turns his head and sees the tell-tale black fur with a white warning-stripe nuzzle against him like an affectionate cat. As if his luck can’t get any worse, this awful night had summoned a skunk of all things to torment him!<br />
<br />
Zack doesn’t know what to do; this little stinker had the power of making him smell like crap for the whole weekend if it wanted to! All he can do is just stand there on his hands and knees trying not to startle it, shivering in the puddle and praying to God it would get bored and walk away. But it doesn’t. It seems to get more affectionate with the passing of each arduous second – like it was toying with him. Its tiny muzzle pecks Zack’s check with a little, wet kiss as that long, fuzzy tail whaps against the side of his head. Its movements are slow and sensual, its furry haunches swaying in front of him as it lifts its tail up high.<br />
<br />
The pre-teen’s eyes dilate in sheer terror as he peers in the dark at the barrel of a stink-gun pointed just inches away from his face. This is it. His life is about to end – at least his social one… for the weekend.<br />
<br />
The skunk’s rear end glistens under the dim glow of a flickering streetlight standing overhead, Zack’s eyes fidgeting, darting here and there as he tries to see from which hole his smelly doom was about to come from. It is diffidently a she, her puffy rear end soaked in a slimy glaze of feral heat that glistened in the streetlight. Her dark-skinned, puffy cameltoe jiggles as she inches it closer to his face, the wobbly mound of feminine flesh making soft, sloppy slurpy sounds as her pussy lips wiggle against one another. Soon, Zack isn’t smelling skunk any more, he’s smelling girl skunk. Searing hot, feral ambrosia starts to overpower her skunk stink as pheromone-laden cunt drool meant only for members of her own species presents itself right in front of his lips, the naive boy left hypnotized until-<br />
<br />
“Schlip-“<br />
<br />
The skunk’s engorged pussy flesh met Zack’s virgin lips. His first kiss wasn’t with the girl in his class he’d always had a crush on. It was with an animal. Her furless skin wasn’t like anything like he’d ever felt before. It was bestial, begging for attention, slick strings of cummy drool connecting her nether lips to his as her super-savory taste of female animal sizzled on the tip of his mouth.<br />
<br />
The gravity of what he did strikes him a moment later as the 12-year-old suddenly flings himself from his fear-induced torpor into a full-on sprint, covering the block between him and the convenience store within a few seconds as he leaves the horny female feral in the dust.<br />
<br />
“Oh god...” He pants, leaning against the stop-light poll. “What… the fuck… was that…?”<br />
<br />
He’s drooling, the skunk’s heat still dripping from his lips as Zack takes the sleeve of his hoodie and frantically rubs it against his lips, trying to wipe away the last few seconds of grossness from his lips.<br />
<br />
He can’t. He can’t get it all away. He can still taste her, her smell still cloying at him – as if telling him to go back.<br />
<br />
“Grossgrossgross…” The preteen boy continues to huff as he tries to catch his breath, drool still pooling on his lips as a shameful erection presses against the crotch of his jeans. As he lifts his sleeve to try to swab away more of the skunk’s flavor, he feels warm fur press against the leg of his damp jeans once again.<br />
<br />
“AAHH!” He shrieks like a girl as he jumps a foot away from the unwelcome touch. It’s not the skunk, instead a black cat’s yellow eyes are starring at him, the feline purring as it sways closer to him, rubbing itself against his leg once again.<br />
<br />
“Jesus… you scared the shit out of me.” Zack shivers, happy that that it isn’t that damned skunk again. It looks like a Momo – one of the neighbor’s cats probably out for a night’s prowl. But… it can’t be her – she’s big. Much bigger than Momo.<br />
<br />
Below him the cat’s tail stands on end as the overgrown feline presses her haunches back against his shin, warm moisture staining his jeans as Zack relives the feeling of animal pussy pressing against him.<br />
<br />
“What the hell… is it mating season for all of you!?” He shouts as he backs away from the cat, darting across the empty street towards the welcoming hum of the 7/11 sign. Just outside the store a raccoon peaks its head out of a nearby dumpster, regarding Zack for a moment before dropping from the trash bin and briskly waddling its way towards the boy.<br />
<br />
Something’s wrong. Something’s very wrong. It was like a horror movie, “Night of the Horny Animals.” And he’s playing the role of the besieged protagonist.<br />
<br />
Zack isn’t going to take his chances. He runs his straight into the sliding door of the convenience store, turning around to watch the door close shut on the raccoon just before it could follow him inside. Its grubby paws clawed at the glass, starring at the preteen boy with an undeniable look of longing.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, little guy.” The store’s lone attendant says, sitting up from her chair, a dopey look peering at him with a combination of bemusement and concern. “What’s wrong? Why are ya all wet? Looks like ya saw a ghost too. Someone after ya, Zack?”<br />
<br />
Zack vigorously nods, babbling for a moment before pausing, blushing as he tries to form a plan to explain the most embarrassing thing of his life. He knows her, he’s seen her working the night shift whenever he comes. Her name is Ches, a super chill red-head girl in her late twenties who’s been employed as a cashier for years. She’s got tattoos and piercings and smells like weed, but despite her gives-no-shits attitude, she’s nice. Zack’s trusted her with embarrassing dating questions in the past and knows he could tell her anything. Anything except this.<br />
<br />
“Th-there’s… something. Outside. Something after me…” He huffs, looking towards the sliding door just to see the skunk and Momo caught up, scratching at the glass door, begging to get at Zack. He sees flickers of fur follow behind them, joining in on pawing against the glass. Other creatures of the night have come too. A fox, a coyote, an owl, more than he could name. They join in right alongside the others, starring at Zack like a juicy piece of meat.<br />
<br />
“Heh, looks like we got a whole zoo out there, huh?” The Ches giggles, “They’re following you? You aren’t related to Snow White by any chance, are ya, kid?”<br />
<br />
Zack stomps his foot in frustration. He knows he’s not in any mortal danger, but he’s unable to express to her what’s happening without having to mention smooching a dripping wet skunk pussy. “Please. I’m just scared… I’m really scared.” He says as an honestly as he can, looking up into the lady’s eyes trying to express what he can’t possibly say.<br />
<br />
That mirthful look on the cashier lady’s face shrinks into one of understanding. “Alright. Don’t worry, Zack, animals their size are too small to activate the door and get in. They’re too small to hurt you anyway, you know?” She reaches over the counter, patting Zack on the shoulder to reassure him. “You can stay in here if you want. Maybe I could call your Mom to pick you up, would you like that?”<br />
<br />
Zack doesn’t know. He doesn’t want to have to explain what happened tonight to his Mom. He just wants to forget everything.<br />
<br />
He turns back to look at the animals. Somehow, they look even bigger now than just a moment ago. Like… they’re growing.<br />
<br />
“Can you… lock the doors too?” Zack asks anxiously with a pleading look towards the cashier. “M-maybe we should call animal control too…”<br />
<br />
“Calm down, hun, just calm down.” She reassures Zack, squeezing his shoulder. “Hey, how about ya pick up some snacks on me. I won’t charge ya.”<br />
<br />
Zack perks up immediately, “Wait. Really? Won’t you lose your job if you just let me take stuff for free?”<br />
<br />
She smiles and shakes her head. “There’s always some shrinkage in this business, kid. Stuff just gets broke or goes missing – we can just write it off as that, alright?”<br />
<br />
“O-okay!” Zack nods, returning a smile. “I won’t take much – just like ten dollar’s worth, alright?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, kid. Just lighten up, nothing bad’s gonna happen to ya. If those animal don’t leave in a couple minutes, I’ll just shoo ‘em away.” Ches smiles as she waves him towards the candy isle, watching the fear on his face melt away as he looks through snack options.<br />
<br />
Maybe she’s right. Maybe Zack can still have a good Friday night.<br />
<br />

<br />
Back at home, the tablet whirrs as it processes the changes to world around it, the Chronovac’s progress screen reading, “Altering reality…”<br />
<br />
Despite Ches’s assurances, nothing will stop the app as long as its running. The world will change more and more until the Chronovac completes what he unwittingly asked for. Reality bends, the laws of physics get rewritten, everything is changing towards a single goal Zack getting unbirthed into his new mother.</p>
