<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You shake your head and sit down, arms and legs crossed, as you try and concentrate on what to do. Closing your eyes in thought, your mind wanders trying to come up with something. Your mind seems to immediately drift to what seem to be well worn thought patterns; go play with some animals, get some food, or go spy on the village near the edge of the jungle. Rocking back and forth on the ground, you wonder about those thoughts, it seemed like your new body come with new experiences and desires. It was an odd sensation with your old and new thoughts mixing and sometimes pushing against each other. Like a part of you was excited and embarrassed over your current state of dress, another didn&#39;t even really think about it, if was just how you dressed because the villagers got upset when they saw you without anything on.<br />
<br />
As memories of previous encounters with other humans came bubbling up, you heard something. Voices! Oh, oh! You loved it when people came into the jungle! Always looking for something or getting lost. It was so much fun being around new people. Without a second thought, you bounce back to your small, agile feet, and dashed to the nearest tree, quickly climbing it. Reflexively you move towards the voices as stealthily as you can; as much as you liked meeting strangers both sets of memories knew that some people weren&#39;t&#39; very nice.<br />
<br />
Soon you find them. A couple of teenagers, a girl and boy, looking around nervously. Immediately you have a clash of thoughts again. They seem to be wearing things right out of a JRPG, but you also know that while the specifics are new, clothing looked like that in general.<br />
<br />
The girl, who seemed about 16, seemed to be wearing some white robe like dress with a red tabard with her hood down and was carrying a simple staff with a decorative shape on top, looking for all the world a white mage... though you find you don&#39;t quite remember what that is. Oh well, probably not important then. <br />
<br />
The boy seemed a little older, maybe 18, and had some fancier looking clothes, with more shiny things and a cape. Ah, and a sword; he looked like one of those important people... lord? Prince? Yeah, one of those seemed right. Were you forgetting things? <br />
<br />
You leaned forward on your branch to get a better look at them and try and hear what they were saying. The girl seemed upset, but was talking too quickly for you to pick anything out; you didn&#39;t talk real well so people needed to talk slow and clear for you to have any real hope of understanding them... did you speak English anymore? You momentarily felt some nervousness as you realized the changes may be go even deeper then you were suspecting, but then the boy started talking quickly snapping you out of your momentary funk.<br />
<br />
The boy wasn&#39;t any happier and was looking anxiously around. That normally meant they were lost. So you should probably help the- *snap* your branch suddenly gave way! You let out a yelp of surprise and tried to grab a vine before you had yet another tumble out of the trees, those hurt! Unfortunately none that were in reach were strong enough to hold you and you found yourself once again on the jungle floor. This time with your face in the dirt and decaying foliage.<br />
<br />
The two teenagers immediately stop talking and when you look up at them as you get up, they are staring at you with wide, confused eyes. The boy had pushed the girl behind him and was ready to pull out his sharp thing! Sword! You quickly put up your hands in front of yourself, &quot;Sss-Staap!&quot; that wasn&#39;t right, &quot;Stope?&quot; no not that either, &quot;Stop!&quot; you shout proudly, grinning ear to ear, then remember why you were trying to remember how to say that word. <br />
<br />
Nervously you look at the boy who, now that you were at ground level seemed really tall. The girl as well for that matter. They seemed to have relaxed already. You probably seemed completely harmless to them, and while you knew (again, how was a complete mystery), that wasn&#39;t entirely the case, they didn&#39;t need to know or think that. The girl came out from behind the boy, smiling and approached you.<br />
<br />
She knelt down so she was closer to your new height and started talking you, &quot;Hello, we&#39;re travelers from Akala. My name is Ava and my companion&#39;s name is Vardan. What&#39;s your name?&quot; You scrunch up your face in concentration as you listen and are able to piece together what she said, mainly because everyone who felt like talking to you started this way. &quot;Name Gao!&quot; you point at yourself grinning, using the what one traveler had called you. It was energetic and fun sounding, which you felt fit you perfectly.<br />
<br />
Akala was, from what you&#39;d been able to figure out, the place on the dawn side of the forest, and the village you normally went to spy one when you were bored. The villagers were familiar with you enough, you didn&#39;t exactly shy away from them went into the jungle to hunt and forage. These two didn&#39;t really look like the locals though, especially the man. His hair and eyes were colors you&#39;d never seen before... in this life? Your head felt dizzy briefly but it passed.<br />
<br />
His hair was golden and he had blue eyes, both really caught your attention, and meant that he at least wasn&#39;t from Akala. The girl had more normal black hair and brown eyes, but had much paler skin, so also was probably from one of those far off places she&#39;d some pictures of in some books travelers had shown her. But whatever. They seemed nice.<br />
<br />
Ava started talking to you again, this time though you had no clue what the gibberish coming from her was supposed to mean, only recognizing about half of what she said and understanding less. Overwhelmed you put your hands out again, &quot;Gao talk bad, Ava talk slow please?&quot; you managed to blurt out. She gasps and apologizes, &quot;Sorry. Um... bad people follow us.&quot; She says slowly, pointing at herself and Vardan, &quot;Get lost. Gao help?&quot;</p>
