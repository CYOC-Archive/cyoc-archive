<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leopold Rogers stared at the medallion he had fished from the trash, not caring why the teenager had thrown it away, only caring that it was clearly metal, possibly gold, and therefore could fetch a decent price down at the local pawnshop. And money meant that he could get that which he really wanted, a device that he had been eying for some time in a porn store just a couple doors from where he lived.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then the fun really will begin,&quot; he told himself as he thought of all that he could do to the horrible people of this stinking city.<br />
<br />
Pocketing the medallion, his mind racing with the toxic thoughts that otherwise kept him occupied, Leopold reached for the rest of his meal, took one final look at the trash he had dumped onto the floor, figured one the jerks that worked here would clean it up and turning his attention back to his meal, he resumed eating.<br />
<br />
After he had finished his meal, Leopold left the restaurant, eager to get home, not caring or listening as one of mindless peons hollered something at him as he left the restaurant. Walking the several blocks downtown, hating every car and every person driving them as the bright head lamps of each auto washed over him, Leopold thought about what he had waiting at home and licking his lips eagerly, he thought about what the device he had been eying would do to the creature that he had carefully taken.<br />
<br />
Arriving at his apartment building, he listened to the various screams of displeasure and hate echoed out several open windows and through the street, glad that there were several others just as miserable as he was. Letting himself into his building, he quickly made his way to the second floor and letting himself into his apartment, he was momentarily glad that somebody, at some point in the past, had sound-proofed the whole building as he did not want his neighbours butting into his business. Especially when it concerned the awful creature and the lesson he intended to teach it.<br />
<br />
As he shrugged off his coat, he took the medallion out of his coat pocket, looked at and then placed it into his pants pocket, took it out and after a bit of thought, decided that he would make the creature wear it as he placed it around his neck. Throwing his coat onto the nearest chair, he licked his lips in anticipation at what was to come.<br />
<br />
Stepping quickly through the apartment, he made his way to a closet and opening it, he licked his lips again, a guilty sense of pleasure that his mamma had taught him was wrong washed over him as he felt himself become erect at the joys and teachings that were to commence. Pulling on the loose section of the wall, he had had accidentally found it about two weeks after he moved in, Leopold exposed the hidden room behind the closet and the creature that was lying on the floor, a gag over its mouth, a blindfold over its eyes and its hands secured behind its back to a heavy, lead pipe with a pair of military issue handcuffs.<br />
<br />
Peering down at the creature, studying as if one would study a curious insect, Leopold figured the creature was about thirteen, the oldest of the creatures he had ever taken. It was small for a creature its age and he figured it must be what his mamma called &quot;petite&quot;. Its clothes were a one piece dress that hugged the creatures body until it reached the creature's waist, then it ballooned out in a flowing, multi-tiered fashion before finally come down to the creature's small, slippered feet.<br />
<br />
As he touched the soft fabric of the creature's clothes, Leopold noted that it was a light blue on top, until just under the creature's breasts, then it was white until about where the creature's knees would be, then it was a light pink colour the rest of the way down.<br />
<br />
The creature shuddered suddenly and knowing it was awake, Leopold withdrew his hand, gently brushing against the creature's breasts as he did so, liking how small, but supple they felt beneath the soft material. Turning away from the creature, hating the bad feeling that was coming over him, knowing that if his mamma was here that she would beat him with the handle of the broom or mop, Leopold stifled a cry as he headed back into the main area of his apartment to collect a bottle of what he called &quot;sleepy-time&quot; and a rag.<br />
<br />
Dousing the rag in the liquid, wrinkling his nose at the odour and heading back to where the creature was, liking how it moved about in a cramped manner and how it was unable to really go anywhere, Leopold pressed the rag to the creature's face, just below the nose and gently began making shushing noises like his mamma had when she had made him breathe in the &quot;sleepy-time&quot; rag.<br />
<br />
When he was satisfied that it was asleep, Leopold returned the bottle and rag to where he kept them and collecting the key for the handcuffs he headed back to where the creature was. Undoing the bindings that secured the creature's hands, he turned it over so that it was lying on its front and began to search for whatever that secured the creatures dress. Finding three buttons up near the creature's neck, Leopold pushed away the auburn hair and undid the buttons.<br />
<br />
After he had rolled the creature back over, he began to remove the creatures dress. Exposing the creature from the waist up, liking that it wasn't wearing anything to cover and hold its breasts in place, Leopold whimpered out, &quot;Leopold has been a bad boy. His mamma is going to give him the treatment,&quot; as he gingerly touched the flesh, liking how the nipples on one of the creature's breast felt.<br />
<br />
Pulling the dress the rest of the way of, noting that the creature was wearing a pair of small, nearly revealing pair of panties, Leopold reapplied the handcuffs and then turned away. As he headed out of the hidden room, he thought to himself, &quot;They always do. Young, middle age or old. They always do and never learn,&quot; as he hugged the dress close, liking the way it smelled, unaware that the medallion he was wearing had tangled itself into the fabric of the dress and was now touching his lower arm.<br />
<br />
A sharp pain in his chest and arms caused him to stop and thinking of how his mamma had said his daddy had died, Leopold whisper, &quot;Mamma, I'm sorry. I'll be good,&quot; as the sharp pain suddenly increased and dropping the dress, he sat down in a nearby chair and began to whimper, &quot;I'm a good boy. I'm a good boy. Don't hurt me. I'm a good boy,&quot; unaware that as well as pain, his body was slowly shifting.<br />
<br />
The pain building and building, his whimpers getting more and more higher in pitch, he dropped the dress to the floor and squeezed his eyes shut as he tried push himself past the pain that had now engulfed his whole torso, his neck and part of his jaw and was slowly seeping down into his legs. After a moment, it became too much and Leopold, figuring he was dead and that he would never get to teach the creature its lesson, made a desperate grab for the dress, his eyes  still closed, missed and instead found himself slipping into a state of unconsciousness.<br />
<br />
His whimpers growing more and more quiet, he figured that his mamma had been right and that he deserved this, he succumbed to the blackness threatening him and slipped away into the world of the unwaking.</p>
