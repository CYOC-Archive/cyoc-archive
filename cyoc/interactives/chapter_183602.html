<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the four of them took showers, they discussed what further trouble they could get in with the Hexaprobe’s glitch. The formerly straight muscle boys were interested in letting the gay men control their bodies again. After all, they had never felt so much pleasure in their bodies prior to these experiences.<br />
<br />
“What if we swapped bodies and then stayed at each other’s houses? You know, like pretended to be each other for a day?” Lyle asked.<br />
<br />
The other men were agreeable, and they decided that switch partners would be LyleCalvin and AlexGregg. So the brothers were swapping bodies, and the unrelated two were.<br />
<br />
“Wait but if I’m gonna be in Gregg’s body, I don’t wanna stay here in this house. I mean, he has a wife and I’m just not interested,” said Alex.<br />
<br />
Calvin chimed in, “Why don’t you stay at your original house with your brother and I while you’re in Gregg’s body. You can be the one who takes our loads when we get bored, haha.”<br />
<br />
“Oh so we’re just gonna use my body as a cum dump??” Asked Gregg.<br />
<br />
“You know you like it, and I’m sure you’re curious what it’s like to fuck your own pillowy ass,” said Calvin. Greggs ‘reply’ was more of a horny daydreaming face.<br />
<br />
“I’d like,” said Alex, “As long as you don’t feel left behind, Lyle.”<br />
<br />
“That’s fine, I think it’s gonna be a bit kinky pretending to be someone else,” said Lyle.<br />
<br />
The four men logged into the Hexaprobe and switched their avatars. One by one, they intentionally logged out into the wrong bodies, until everyone was in the body they wanted. Lyle said goodbye to Calvin, Gregg, and Alex, and the three headed off to Alex and Lyle’s place.<br />
<br />
Lyle needed to make his way to Calvin’s parents’ home. Despite Calvin’s age, he lived in his parents home. Perhaps not that uncommon given the housing market. His mother was long dead, so he just lived with his father. Before heading over, Lyle packed up the Hexaprobe.<br />
<br />
Once inside, Lyle announced himself, “Uh, dad I’m home.” It was weird to call a stranger dad.<br />
<br />
Calvin’s dad answered from the living room, “Hey son, grab me a beer.”<br />
<br />
Lyle grabbed a beer from the fridge and walked into the living room. He was shocked, or pleasantly surprised to find Calvin’s dad lounging completely nude on the couch. Guess he wasn’t worried about his grown son seeing him naked. Lyle couldn’t help but stare a bit at Calvin’s dad’s penis and body. His dad, Nate, had short brown hair, blue eyes, and a hairy body that was thin, muscular and short. His dick was about seven inches flaccid. Lyle couldn’t believe that this man was related to the tall, smooth, blonde, beefy body with the small dick that he was in right now.<br />
<br />
“What’re you staring at boy? You’re making me feel uneasy,” said Nate.<br />
<br />
“Sorry dad, I think I just zoned out,” said Lyle.<br />
<br />
“Well the next time you zone out can it not be while looking at my dick? The last thing I need in this house is a homo,” said Nate.<br />
<br />
So that’s how it was going to be, thought Lyle. “Hey dad, Gregg got an expensive virtual reality game as a beta tester and he let me borrow it, wanna test it out?” Asked Lyle innocently from Calvin’s body.<br />
<br />
“Free is my favorite price,” said Nate, grabbing a brainwave helmet.<br />
<br />
The two logged in and Lyle quickly switched his avatar to Nate and logged out. He saw Calvin’s body unconscious with the helmet on. He was in homophobe Nate’s body. He quickly looked down and saw his new massive penis.<br />
<br />
“First things first,” said Lyle, smelling his new pits. This body needs a shower. Lyle showered Nate’s forty year old body attentively. When he was done, he stepped out and saw himself in the mirror. Nate had a full mustache and beard, rippling abs, and a nice hairy bubble butt for someone with so little body fat.<br />
<br />
Lyle headed back over to the living room. Calvin’s body was still unconscious. Lyle decided to explore Calvin’s unconscious body from a third person perspective. He pulled down his pants and underwear, revealing the flaccid two inch penis. Before he got sucking on it, Lyle took the briefs that were on Calvin’s body and put them on his new body. Nate would never approve, but Lyle didn’t give a fuck what that homophobe wanted. He checked out his middle aged briefs-clad ass in the tv reflection. The front of the briefs were stuffed with cock.<br />
<br />
“Well, a good father takes care of his son,” laughed Lyle, who started to suck Calvin’s little dick. It got hard quickly and Lyle kept sucking while playing with his new big dick. Suddenly he heard a stirring above him.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?!” Said Nate from his son’s body. He threw the helmet off of himself and it landed with a crash.<br />
<br />
Lyle got up and backed away.<br />
<br />
“You’re me!” Said Nate. Looking down he said, “and I’m you...Why the hell were sucking your own penis?? And in my body! And what the hell kind of faggot underwear are you wearing in my body.”<br />
<br />
“Oh this,” Lyle stuck out his ass, rubbing his hand over the cotton of the briefs, “I thought you looked sexy in these. You see, I’m tired of you being such a homophobe, dad. I’m gonna give you a new reputation around town as the kind of guy who would fuck any decent looking man.”<br />
<br />
“You wouldn’t dare,” said Nate.<br />
<br />
“I would’ve swallowed the load from that little penis with your own mouth if you hadn’t logged out,” said Lyle.<br />
<br />
Nate had been avoiding looking down. He saw his son’s, now his penis. It was a four inch erection. That’s half the size of his normal erection. “No my python!” He said.<br />
<br />
“Okay, son,” said Lyle, “Daddy needs some alone time in his new body.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck you Calvin! Switch us back!” Said Nate, desperate to get his trusty body back.<br />
<br />
“I couldn’t if I wanted to. You just broke one of the helmets. Two people need to log in at once to switch bodies,” Lyle explained.<br />
<br />
Nate let it sink in that this was his reality for now.<br />
<br />
Just then, the doorbell rang. Lyle answered in Nate’s body, wearing nothing but the pair of briefs. It was a handsome UPS driver.<br />
<br />
“Oh thank you, stud,” said Lyle receiving the package, which was a satellite for the house, “Would you happen to want a quick fuck?”<br />
<br />
The man was taken aback, but assessing the large cock in Lyle’s briefs, he accepted the unusual offer. The delivery man was fat and muscular, about 5’5”, compared to Lyle’s new body being 5’7”. <br />
<br />
Nate watched helplessly as the delivery man went upstairs with his former body. He could hear them fucking like rabbits upstairs for twenty minutes. Wasn’t the delivery guy worried about being fired?<br />
<br />
Lyle came downstairs with the delivery man and kissed him goodbye, thanking him for a great time. Nate glared with Calvin’s eyes, which just made Lyle feel more powerful.</p>
