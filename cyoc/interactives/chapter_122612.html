<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jack Crawford was raving up in his condo; upset that Kenya could not be found and that he was barred from looking for her, thanks to the ankle monitor placed on him. Kenya was two floors down in a small apartment crying into an empty tea cup. The apartment in question was owned by Jack Crawford and was used to house his butler.<br />
<br />
“Here you go,” the butler approaching the distraught woman and handing her a tissue; “Let me take that cup from you okay?”<br />
“Thank you,” Kenya taking the tissue; “you don’t suppose I can stay here for the night?”<br />
“I don’t think that is wise,” the butler hesitating; “You are in heat and my boss’s spouse…”<br />
“I’m also your boss,” Kenya chocking back a tear; “I could order you.”<br />
“I’m sure you could,” the butler sighing; “but I’d rather we not go down that road again.”<br />
“Jeffries,” Kenya sighing; “I doubt me staying here is going to lead to sex.”<br />
<br />
“While I can’t recall I’m sure you said something similar,” the butler looking at Kenya coolly; “during that soirée at the Knight Estate.”<br />
Jeffries heading back to his small kitchen to put the empty tea cup and saucer in the sink. Remembering the party when his current employer; going by the name Jack Ashford was arm in arm with Kenya. At the time Kenya was using her Kendra Smythe alias; Jefferies never put much thought into the two as they danced and mingled during Benton and Amanda’s social function. At the time Jefferies had no clue that Ashford and Crawford was the same person.<br />
“Come to think,” Jefferies speaking to himself; “neither did you Benton.”<br />
 “Did you say something,” Kenya speaking up; hearing what Jefferies tried to keep to himself.<br />
“Just trying to remember something,” Jefferies speaking; quickly cleaning the cup and saucer and placing them on the drying rack.<br />
<br />
Going back to that evening in Moon Lake at the Knight estate, Jefferies recalls the time that Kendra and Jack had a squabble. Nearly causing a scene that would have ruined the fine evening; Jeffries recalls Benton’s terse order.<br />
“Escort Mr. Ashford out of here; I will not have him sully this party any more with his presence.”<br />
<br />
Jefferies was unsure by what that meant at the time, yet he did what was asked of him; showing the man to his vehicle and instructing him to leave the property promptly. Jefferies soon learned after that Kendra had no ride to take her from the estate. Calling up a cab for her; Jefferies soon found himself entwined with her in bed. With no recollection as to how it happen; Jefferies made sure the woman was off the grounds well before Benton and his family woke up.<br />
<br />
That was the last time he saw of Kendra; when he was still working for Benton. It was a few weeks after the day Benton decked Jefferies that he met Kendra again. Going by the name of Kenya and engaged to Jack Crawford; the were-panther butler never showed his shocked to see a one night stand he once had standing before him as he was interviewed for employment.<br />
<br />
“If you are trying to remember that night,” Kenya staring at Jefferies as he dried his hands; “don’t bother. You had half a bottle of French wine in you and your prick was aching to fill my folds.”<br />
“Please stop,” Jefferies backing away as Kenya slowly approached; “you’re in heat and not in a right frame of mind.”<br />
“Then help me quench this aching feeling in my loins then,” Kenya speaking in a sultry fashion as she disrobes and assumes her were-panthress form; “Jack is most likely still in jail and not expected to be back soon.”<br />
<br />
Seeing Kenya licking her lips as the black furred were-panthress stalked him; eyeing his crotch as he started to feel the effects Kenya’s arousal flooding his sense of smell, Jefferies could feel a tightening in his trouser as he feels his member hardening and rising.<br />
“Come now Jefferies,” Kenya seeing the obvious tenting in his pants; “you might be saying no, but your body is screaming yes. Why not give in,” Kenya cornering Jefferies and sticking a paw down his trousers; feeling the steely shaft and murring in delight.<br />
<br />
“Mrs. Crawford,” Jefferies fighting back the urge to moan as Kenya kept stroking and massaging his member; “please… I… I’m not going to last much longerrrrrr.”<br />
Jefferies breaking down as he elicits a moan; not even paying attention as Kenya deftly unbuttons his trousers and yanking them down. The cool air on his raging hard on, caused Jefferies to growl; his eyes fluttering as he now feels Kenya’s tongue dancing around the tip of his shaft.<br />
“Let yourself go Jefferies,” Kenya cooing; “let your panther out.”<br />
“This is not right,” Jefferies feeling the pressure building; “please stop. I beg you.”<br />
“The sooner I get what I want,” Kenya mumbling; as she has Jefferies’s shaft in her maw. “The sooner we stop.”<br />
“OH shit,” Jefferies wincing as he erupts; spraying Kenya’s mouth with his hot seed; hearing her suck and slurp down each thick ropey spurt as he continues to drain his balls dry.<br />
<br />
“That was fun,” Kenya raising her head; “but I still need more.”<br />
“No,” Jefferies using that moment to get away; pulling up his trousers as he manages to get himself out of the corner he was in. “I cannot do what you are asking,” Jefferies still feeling flushed; “If you husband found out. If you somehow became pregnant because you wanted to rut with me…”<br />
<br />
Jefferies was about to continue some more, when his phone rang. Grabbing it and seeing Jack Crawford on the caller I.D.; Jefferies sighs as he answers it, making sure that Kenya could hear the conversation.<br />
“Master Crawford,” Jefferies sounding surprised; managing to hold back his relief as he sees Kenya pout. “Is everything alright? Last I saw those unruly feds dragged you out in handcuffs.”<br />
“Never mind that,” Jack sounding upset; “get up here. I need your help; Kenya has disappeared.”<br />
“Kenya is with me,” Jefferies looking at the were-panthress de-fur and getting dressed; “she was distraught when she got back and I felt it best she not be alone.”<br />
“Oh,” Jack responding; “then please bring her up here, I need to talk to her. And while I’m with Kenya,” Jack continuing; “I need you to go and get a laptop for me. Use the charge card I gave you. I’m under house arrest and the feds won’t return my office computer; seized for evidence regarding the attempted murder of Frederic Parker.”<br />
“We’ll be up right away sir,” Jefferies hanging up; Looking at Kenya as she walks past him, Jefferies shakes his head. “Jack must never know what just took place,” Jefferies following Kenya as she heads out the door.<br />
“Know what,” Kenya walking to the elevator; “that you got a blow job? Be lucky that is all you got,” Kenya turning around; her demeanor completely changing from the distraught woman, to a person with cold detachment. “Just make sure you complete what Jack has for you.”<br />
‘Wow,’ Jefferies thinking to himself; ‘and I thought Amanda Knight could be cold.’</p>
