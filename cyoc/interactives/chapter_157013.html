<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mmmf... Fuck,&quot; Eli moaned, feeling the sunshine beam gently on his bearded face, his youthful regression had influenced various things in his 40 year old mentality, a budding new sexuality, loud and proud... The reveling of the envious and lustful looks of staffers and students alike... And even more, a new appreciation for the rigid physique that made both his cock throb and surge with glee as a thick palm travelled down the cobblestoned abs and treasure trail to the needy member. He had slept naked, again for the... What? <br />
<br />
The concept would have been so shocking and enticing to the old Eli and Ellenore, but now that Coach Eli was on the warpath of building his new life... Well, what was a little self care on a free day? Lower stress means lower chances of gray hair and worry wrinkles, Ellenore once said.<br />
<br />
His hands knew exactly where to reach, one hand stroking his growing appendage expertly as the other worshipped his Adonis like figure, his pecs had since become shelf like, the mass had at once threatened to swallow up his gym tank top but with the current modifications Eli had a bust that had threatened nigh all of his wardrobe that weren&#39;t luxuriously oversized. The coach trembled at the thought, his earlier antics of dreaming of being on the big stage inspired him to waltz into his closet with a &#39;mirin twunk that asked him for his workout tips at the local gym and found himself goading Eli into ripping out of and flexing off whatever paltry fabric he had. Dress shirts that were sized for a middle aged man had altered accordingly with the multiple edits Gary made, most of them becoming slim and athletic form fitted, others accentuated the rock hard glutes the Coach prided himself over. <br />
<br />
The Chronivac was a wonderful thing, so powerful in its altering reality, that Eli&#39;s memories of once being out of shape and wearing his old outfits were seemingly that of embarrassing moments that he had before he went through his miraculous routine of beating Father Time and any other man&#39;s chronological downfall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, Daddy&#39;s feelin&#39; real spry today,&quot; Eli moaned, groping his large chest and running his hardy palm over whatever muscular surface he could find, the hand oh so tenderly caressing his cock flexed into a pumped bicep as he licked the muscle with lust, he was an Alpha, a true beast in the gym, and though the terminology was perhaps... Childish, maybe even way out of his time, the word gave Eli new feelings, he loved the feeling of getting a good pump and having others notice, he thoroughly enjoyed the spotlight, both at the gym and at home where he could give his own personal superstar the worship the teachers at his job wished they could indulge. <br />
<br />
After taking the hour to near roar in satisfaction as he pumped himself of all morningwood, Eli rolled himself out of bed and began his ritual of checking the scale and seeing the aura, the sheer maleness that he had begun to truly pride on: Taking the time to triumphantly noting his increased weight and upon seeing the scale creak at an enormous 300 lbs, Eli chuckled deeply, as he looked in the bathroom mirror. At 250 lbs, he knew that all the bodybuilders currently peacocking themselves on Instagram or Youtube were up in arms about how their weight was all thanks to their many supplements or their snake-oil gear, but Eli had his thanks cut out to his sexual energy, his genes, and perhaps better yet, his all natural figure that was forged by intense weight training and determination.<br />
<br />
Never in his 40 years would he expect such results, and Eli basked in his seemingly 23 year old body as he felt the surge of excitement flood into his crotch once more, the rejuvenation did so much more for his confidence. So, so much more, he thought, running a hand over his bearded mug and realized a good trim was in order, turning round and inspecting his prodigious body with hungry eyes to see how best to improve himself. Darkened hair ran gently across the rugged slopes, his chest hair was gloriously peppered across the nipples down to his treasure trail, his biceps, he considered, would need focus as he felt the melon sized muscles tense and patted them down to test resistance. <br />
<br />
Throwing his towel onto the rack and getting ready to head to the gym, Eli heard a ping from his phone away in his bedroom but thought nothing of it, it could wait, as he slipped back inside to retrieve it and loaded up his camera app, he had a far more important event to catch as he proceeded to step into the shower and lathered himself up generously with soap. Thankfully, despite the clash of his mental age and his Chronivac edited reality, waterproof phones were the much appreciated norm presently for his next venture...<br />
<br />
________<br />
<br />
Eli felt himself grow distracted as he completed the next set of arm curls, something was off, but exactly what, he could not pinpoint. He had arrived to the gym in peak shape and gear, but for each curl, Eli&#39;s crotch bunched up and his body became more sensitive to the touch. He gasped slightly when he felt the brush of another gym goer politely asking to move by him and grab a pair of light weights, thankfully, they were not surprised by his reactions and left quickly. Eli slammed the 50 lb dumbbells onto their rack, feeling slightly off from his original 55 lbs the other day as he adjusted his backwards gym snapback. Try as he might, he couldn&#39;t help but feel the surge of energy coupled with his growing need to take care of &quot;other business&quot; arouse within himself, but where was the fire! Where was his passion!<br />
<br />
Eli pardoned himself after the 3rd set to retreat into the locker room, hoping to literally blow off some steam as he nearly fell onto the graciously spacious locker room bench and pulled the tightened gym shirt&#39;s neck to reveal light steam exuding off his body. Despite only doing 3 sets of 20 curls, Eli felt his heart beat ever faster and his body begin to moisten with sweat, his entire body soaking the trendy white gym shirt and showing off the treasure laid beneath them.<br />
<br />
I can do this... I can do this...<br />
<br />
He was a coach, a man&#39;s man, he was going to set himself straight and do the right thing, go right back to those weights, finish his curls, hit his tri&#39;s, and then he&#39;d--<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Ohh...&quot; Eli moaned, his body had tensed while he was racked with the feeling of slight nausea, it felt like his body was going into overdrive as he felt his chest lurch forward and his gloved fingers let go of his shirt. His arms clenched up, Eli in a stupor, dropping them to his sides before he frantically tried to peel off the gloves from their confinement while feeling the need to tear off everything on his body and take care of his throbbing dick. The Coach tried to lift himself up, but he ended up falling from the sheer body weight he had bulked up, mentally cursing his brawn as he struggled to raise himself up. In a panic, Eli pawed the lock on his locker, tore off his shirt in a hurry and tossed the shreds into the locker before dropping his shorts and kicking off his shoes into the container. <br />
<br />
Swiping a (by far definitely not) medium white towel, Eli scampered off into the showers, though the heavier thudding of his footsteps in the empty room was not at all touching upon the 23 year old&#39;s intimate needs taking first priority despite his &quot;true&quot; age. He practically threw himself into the shower, slamming the water valve to hot and felt the still lukewarm water splashing on his heated body. &quot;A-Ahh...&quot; He pitifully moaned, caressing his chest as he felt pressure from the two slabs jostle slightly in his firm grips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess the boys... Had&#39;ta breathe,&quot; He chuckled, unaware of the changes yet to be made onto his now enlarging body, as his arms washed and lathered his body with the complimentary gym soap, Eli hadn&#39;t noticed the surging biceps that had begun to pulsate and give weight to his already bulging arms. The triceps had made their move, making his arm appear thicker, though, from the amount of suds that Eli had haphazardly tossed on, the signs of a light pelt were not alarming. Eli craned his neck upwards as he knocked his nipple, hissing as his body was still sensitive, ignorant to the striated traps that decorated his form and curved seductively from his strong neck to his boulder-esque shoulders.<br />
<br />
 Washing his underarms, Eli attempted to take his body and any sexual thoughts from his mind, but as he did so, his back had bumped into the wall repeatedly as his lats swallowed more of the room and in a daze, lathered his brawny thighs, taking comfort in that there was more &quot;places&quot; to caress and worship while trying to cleanse himself. His rear took the new weight splendidly, the already large gluteus muscles flexing and relaxing as the bouncy flesh rounded themselves further. Just as Eli had hoped to be rid of himself of his reality, his loins felt inflamed, excited by the intimacy of flesh that the musclebound man had given himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I GOTTA... Gotta...&quot; Eli in vain tried to stop himself, taking what water he could hold in his palms and splashed his face, the sudsy water applying their magic to his jawline and like a sculpture being chiseled by an artisan, his jaw protruded heroically. &quot;NEED to... FUCK.&quot; Eli whimpered, feeling his arm instinctively reach down and grab his needy member and pumped it while he attempted to massage his forehead, the thoughts of his body needing tender attention and the need to go back outside and reach his max were clashing, with the former threatening to take over. His legs trembled, burgeoning body leaning forward to the showerhead before he fell onto his right knee, a large slam echoed through the shower. He put the hand he was massaging his forehead with against the shower wall and jacked off right there, feeling his body hot with desire and passion as he felt himself continue to change, his previously flawless 23 year old skin had roughened up with seeming age and experience, but his arousal had all but disappeared, his furious pace challenged by his modifying body to fit his new role. Eli grunted, his climax rising as he motioned his hips in milking the release.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gonna... CUM...!!&quot; He shouted, exhaling a deep breath as he felt himself release his inclinations and what youth had been forced onto him, his new body taking towards the development perfectly, though now older from what he was, Eli felt his 40 year old mindset find some familiarity in a new body, and as he weakly stumbled out and struggled to wrap his girth with the towel... Eli was shocked to view himself in the mirror, his body was bulging everywhere, so thick and so curvaceous from his ass to his valley like chest as he pounded his pecs with curiosity. The twin peaks bounced, the shelves moving up and down that Eli found himself entranced by the new changes, moving closer to the god that stared at him in the mirror. He felt his jaw and triumphantly smirked as he didn&#39;t notice any worry wrinkles on his forehead, nor the distinct crow&#39;s feet of yesteryear, in fact, it was as if someone photoshopped his anniversary picture over Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s body in his prime, a feat of nature Eli had to be subjected to, no longer feeling the initial nausea but a new blooming fascination for his developed body. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Olympia would be a shoe-in with this sort of condition&quot;, Eli thought to himself, pinching himself and realizing that, no, he was not dreaming at all. &quot;And when the boys see me...&quot; He continued, particularly thinking of Gary&#39;s behemoth like mass, &quot;They won&#39;t be expecting Tiny Coach so soon...&quot;<br />
<br />
As he chuckled to himself over his good luck, he strutted over to his locker with confidence of a renewed man and tensed his body into a most muscular pose before slipping into a seemingly familiar jockstrap (which had at once, been a tight pair of briefs earlier that day) and his shorts and quickly left to return to his post, shirtless, but ready to achieve peak condition.<br />
<br />
Eli felt at home with himself as he sat onto the bench press with a strengthened ego to the excited and shocked gasps of his fellow gym goers. As he felt their eyes scan him, almost drinking in all the internal praise they must have been giving him, Eli noticed the ping of his phone led him to a download screen of an app.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chronivac Mobile... Downloading...&quot;<br />
<br />
Curious to see its contents, Eli waited as he watched the bar go from 1% to a full 100%, where a modern styled &quot;welcome screen&quot; gestured him to view what the app considered his &quot;stats&quot; along with a tutorial on each screen explaining what the application can do. Tapping with a finger slowly, Eli checked out what his stats and mulled over what he could do with this new app, before switching to camera mode and taking a selfie of his upper body before going to finish his sets, eager to see where the good luck could take him...</p>
