<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David walked back into the house his mind ablaze with sensual ideas. Sitting at his desk in the study he set the medallion on a burnt wedge at the edge of the wooden cover of the spell book.<br />
<br />
One page at a time he studied the spells. His thoughts kept going to the farm pages where cows, bulls, sheep, goats, horses, swine, fowl, dogs, cats, and dairy maids were offered as possible transformations.<br />
<br />
Odd a list of animals and then a dairy maid, that wouldn't class itself to a type of animal, David thought.<br />
<br />
His first love was horses and he read the spell very carefully. Then breeze outside had stiffened and Dave got up to closed the window. As he sat back down his mind wondered and his mouth stated his thoughts. &quot;I still can't figure why a dairy maid was listed as an animal? I wish this medallion could help me understand how a dairy maid was considered a animal!&quot;<br />
<br />
David suddenly saw the red stone of the medallion glow. Brighter by the minute it got till the room was bathed in red light. David squinted his eyes as the light washed over him. Sitting in his tall backed leather chair he sat and wondered what he had started.<br />
<br />
Feeling very tired he reached his arms and hands above the head, eyes closed a yawn and stretch, then all light was gone and the room was black. David sat very still, feeling suddenly as if he was now a good deal over weight. Leaning forward he lit a candle and beheld the medallion's power.<br />
<br />
The title 'Dairy Maid' now had a definate meaning. David pushed with his hands on the desk and got to his feet. His clothes were gone but he was dressed for the part of a dairy maid. Replacing the clothes was a covering of dun colored hair. Rings of black hair curled around wrists and feet. David's stance was more hunched as his legs were most completly changed to resemble those of a cow, a Gurnsey! <br />
<br />
David moved a little and tried his new legs for strength. A small movment brought a boney tail swinging from his rear. Walking with high steps he approached the mirror at the hat rack. Peering into the mirror and with the light from one candle his features were unmistakeable. A pretty female human face peered back from the mirror. Yet the sight of cows ears sticking out the sides of her head was a little odd. In place of human hair her head had a furry topknot as the body hair continued everywhere.<br />
<br />
Expecting to see some nice boobs David found a strong flat chest. As he positioned his footing the feeling and sighting saw a glorious udder beginning to fill with milk.<br />
<br />
David hobbled back to his desk as the udder filled quickly. Looking at the spell book and seeing the medallion had fallen from it's mount, David repositioned the medallion. &quot;I wish to be back to my old self by morning, till then I want to understand how this cow feels!&quot;<br />
<br />
The medallion glowed bright as David felt it's power stream over and around his body. Losing his balance David grabbed for the corner on his desk. The medallion's glow quickly stopped and again it fell from it's mount.<br />
<br />
David reached to remount the medallion but found cloven hooves don't work for much other than locomotion. His foolish words had sparked the powers of medallion and book. David turned his head and saw a fine young Gurnsey cow, with one full udder.<br />
<br />
Sense of thoughts left David's head as bovine instinct suggested a cow barn was the right place to be. David sauntered out the french glass door and stopped long enough on the veranda to gulp down the flowers along the path. Again with hind legs spread apart the cow walked slowly down the drive and in the direction of the VanMeijer dairy farm down the road.<br />
<br />
About one in the morning a lone Gurnsey heifer stood Moooing at the front door to the milking barn. David's thought process was now that of a basic Gurnsey cow. A light popped on in the foremans shack as he came running out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where in Hell did you come from, spouted the farm foreman!&quot; Seeing a unmarked lone Grunsey cow the foreman went to the barn office. Walking back he loaded his staple gun and in a short move tagged the valuable cow as one of their prize beasts. Then with halter in place he led David to the waiting pen where his hundred cows stood with udders full.<br />
<br />
As the sun came over the country mansion of David Hahn and lighted the milking barn of VanMiejer the cows lined up for relief. David moved slowly into line and was in time pulled to a feeding stall. As he munched the grain and fodder his/her udder was attached to the milking machine.<br />
<br />
As the sun light hit the cow's brown pupil David began to take human shape. The spell reversed quickly till David lay naked to the world as a man on the sawdust floor of the barn. Looking around his memories of that fate filled night raced in his mind. In that same moment the pain in his ear of the plastic tag still shot threw his ear ached. At the very same moment the wild hard he had on as some milking machine was trying to suck his cock dry.<br />
<br />
Yanking the milking teat clinger free he ran from the barn toward home. Jumping the fence he ran alone the road just inside the corn row. At last he jumped the fence and headed up the lawn to his veranda and safety.</p>
