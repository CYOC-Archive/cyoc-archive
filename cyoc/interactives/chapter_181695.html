<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot; ummn Lina, please don&#39;t tell me you somehow kidnapped a kid while in the bathroom&quot; said Momo as she saw Lina and Echo, she was holding on to Lina for dear life, her legs flailing around trying to get used to walking.<br />
<br />
&quot;One that apparently hasn&#39;t walked a day in her life&quot; said Viki giggling at Echos attempts, Echo having no understanding that Viki was being sarcastic, just smiled her biggest smile and nodded<br />
She really likes to do that, thought lina<br />
<br />
&quot;No Momo I didn&#39;t kidnapped her, it&#39;s ummmmm.....another thing I can&#39;t tell you&quot; said Lina as she petted her belly, indicating to everyone that both the sudden appearance of the babies and Echo were one and the same secret.<br />
<br />
Lina decided to take in the room as everyone asked Echo question after question, Sofia was off the floor, her hands seemed to be glued to her belly, even as she spoke to everyone she never took her hands off it, Violet was still in the armchair with Misty who was hiding her face in Violet&#39;s hair, which Lina found to be adorable, apparently Misty was shy<br />
<br />
Catherine was now up and about, looking a bit banged up, but up and moving none the less, she was currently occupied by the fridge, hungrily eyeing it&#39;s contents, lina guessing she hasn&#39;t eaten in over two days according to her story.<br />
<br />
Then Lina looked to her side to see that Echo had let go!, she now stood to her left, arms outstretched like she was walking a tightrope, a look of panic on her face<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh&quot; was all anyone herd before Echo came crashing down, face first on the floor once again, green mist then puffed out of her ears, almost like a little cartoon  character, Lina giggled, followed by everyone else.<br />
<br />
Their laughter soon stoped however when they herd a small sniffling, Echos back jolting up and down as she drew uneven, rapid breaths to cry, a strange feeling welled up inside Lina, Echo was crying and she needed comfort, and no one was giving it to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, come here sweetie&quot; said Lina as she squated down to scoop Echo into a loving embrace, Echo squeezed Lina and buried her head in Linas breasts, her legs now limp,<br />
<br />
&quot;You gave up trying to use them?&quot; Said Lucy with sympathy, Echo just nodded, refusing to look at anyone, her face still buried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll all get you joining and jumping around in no time&quot; said Lina as she stroked Echos hair, then she Jumped as a forren feeling started in her breasts, it felt, heavy, and leaking?, like liquid in them was seeping out, but what caused Lina to jump was not the sudden feeling in her breasts, but the sudden suction feeling and sound on her right breast<br />
<br />
&quot;Well looks like someone has made a mama figure out of you&quot; said Catherine as she smiled at the scene before everyone<br />
<br />
Echo had latched on to Linas breasts, her eyes closed, breathing deeply between suckles, a small dribble of milk running down the side of her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she&#39;s started now&quot; said Lina smiling maternaly at Echo, cupping a hand behind her head to better support her as she lifted her up with surprising ease, for a eight year old she weighed as much as a newborn, and Lina sat in the rocking chair, Momo had used previously<br />
<br />
Viki tossed Lina a blanket, but as Lina began to swaddle Echo in it she noticed something, and judging by everyone&#39;s looks, they had noticed as well. <br />
<br />
Echo was practicly all plastic and bones, no padding what so ever, hardly any muscle, no wonder she had trouble standing by herself, let alone walking<br />
<br />
Lina was now more determined than ever to look after this girl, her maternal tigh to her growing stronger by the minute, so lina dis what she could at that moment, she held Echo as close to her as she could without hurting her with one hand, and with the other she began massaging her breast, coxing more milk to flow for her hungry girl<br />
<br />
&quot;So where are we with preparations&quot; said Lina with new found determination<br />
<br />
&quot;Well with the nest gone, my guesses is that our numbers are in the thirty&#39;s, if we&#39;re lucky the fourty&#39;s&quot; said Momo grimly &quot;were spread too thin, our people are scattered to all four corners of the city limits, police are watching the exits around the clock now&quot; said Viki<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds exactly like a kill box&quot; said Violet &quot;they must have been counting on finding the nest, give them an exuse to lock down the city, box them in and wipe us all out&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A clever move&quot; said Sofia &quot;but iv got an idea around that, everyone&#39;s attention now turned to Sofia as she explained her idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get as many out as we can to make this work, we&#39;ve clarified that point, but while everyone has been focused on how many, iv been focused on how to get out, and with that let me present you with this&quot; she said tossing a disc into the coffee table, a hologram of a train car apered but something about its shape was off<br />
<br />
&quot;Iv been experimenting with some hover tech and I think if I can finish this train that is stored on the old tracks&quot; she said before Lucy finished &quot;we can get everyone out without having to use train lines or roads&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct, pluss it has everything we need to set up shop, 3d printers, seeds, building materials, you name it we got it&quot; said Sofia with a grin<br />
<br />
&quot;How long do you need&quot; said Lina, watching as Sofia did the math &quot;with enough help, three days&quot; this was the best news they had received in days, they had a plan, and now a way to execute it<br />
<br />
&quot;Momo, can you get the remaining sectors in the city to try and meet us here, Sofia is gonna need all the help she can get&quot; said Lina looking in Momos direction as Echo stored, patting Linas breast in her sleep<br />
<br />
&quot;It will take some convincing but I think I can make it happen&quot; said Momo with a grin &quot;Hey don&#39;t think you can leave us out of the equation&quot; said Catherine as she stood behind the chair Violet and Misty were in, putting a hand on Violet&#39;s shoulder, and Violet placing a hand over hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;And us two lover&quot; said Lucy as she and Viki walked over to Lina hand in hand <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok people&quot; said momo &quot;let&#39;s get to work!&quot;</p>
