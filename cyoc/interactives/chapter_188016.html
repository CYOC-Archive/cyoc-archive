<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay,&quot; Jenna said, showing Francine the sentence. &quot;Ready to make some changes?&quot; <br />
<br />
Francine nodded as Jenna now typed in the changes. Jenna was taking her time, making sure that nothing was potentially problematic. She had seen first hand the potential extra, unpredictable changes that could occur if she wasn&#39;t careful. She replaced &quot;24&quot; with &quot;20&quot; but then wondered if that was the right call. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should try 21 instead?&quot; She thought to herself. &quot;Could be better if we&#39;re seniors.&quot; She contemplated.<br />
<br />
As she began to change it to read 21 instead, everything would come crashing down as Francine grew restless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, hurry up Jen! I don&#39;t want to work at a McDonalds just make the change already!&quot; She growled, half playfully slugging Jenna on the arm.<br />
<br />
Jenna&#39;s heart sunk. Her hand had slipped when Francine nudged her, and after erasing the 1 from 21, her hand had landed on the icon which confirmed the change. She only had a moment to look at Francine with a mix of fury and concern before the world around her became much, much larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen...&quot; Francine began as she changed. &quot;Wha happa?&quot; She asked, her speech suddenly much more limited.<br />
<br />
Jenna couldn&#39;t believe it. In front of her very eyes, Francine had transformed into a two year old girl! She looked just like some baby pictures of Francine that Jenna had seen years ago. She was an adorable toddler, with long curly brown hair tied up in a giant bun above her head. Her hair ties were bright pink, which matched her new bright pink dress she now wore. Jenna could also tell she was wearing a pull up underneath her clothes.<br />
<br />
Jenna fearfully looked down, finding herself also changed. Her body looked adorably tiny. She wore a pair of brown overalls with a bright yellow shirt with big bird on it underneath that. She also felt what must have been some kind of pull up beneath her pants. She used her tiny hands to feel all around. Her ears were no longer pierced, her now much more red looking hair was tied into two long pigtails, and she wore teeny velcro shoes on her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wook what did!&quot; Jenna yelled, feeling tears welling up in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me did! You did!&quot; Francine snapped back, stomping her foot in anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, girls, no yelling!&quot; A voice suddenly rang out.<br />
<br />
Jenna and Francine both froze, then looked up. Their jaws dropped once they saw the two women who were now standing near them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy?&quot; Francine asked, utterly confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mama?&quot; Jenna asked to the other woman.<br />
<br />
Standing there were Francine and Jenna&#39;s mothers, except now looking DECADES younger, possibly in their early 30s. Jenna&#39;s mother, Betty, was a slightly chubby red head with decent breasts but a huge hips and ass combo, making her very pair shaped. She wore a comfy looking sweater and tight jeans which emphasized her MILFY glow. Francine&#39;s mother, Gina, was also quite a looker. She had wavy blonde hair, stood nearly half a foot taller than Betty, and was dressed in a stylish pant suit with a bluetooth hanging on her ear. She was skinnier, but less emphasized in her figure than Betty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy wha happa?&quot; Francine asked, confused as hell to see her mother here like this. Her mother was a kind little old rich lady who loved to walk her poodles and knit sweaters for her grandchildren. She looked like she did ages ago, but seemed more... serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear, Betty I told you letting them walk around was a mistake. My poor baby is exhausted and she&#39;s confused.&quot; Gina sighed. &quot;Come here Franny, here sweetie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Francine tried to resist, but found herself effortlessly lifted up by her mother. She was amazed at how far the ground seemed below her, and she instinctively clung to her mother for protection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh, you need a nap baby. Betty?&quot; Gina asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright agreed, we&#39;ll let the girls rest then.&quot; Betty sighed, revealing a double stroller that had been just obscured behind her.<br />
<br />
As she walked over to collect her own child, Jenna thought fast, quickly shoving the phone down her overalls. She didn&#39;t know how reality changed, so she couldn&#39;t risk someone else claiming ownership over the only thing that could return her and Francine to their normal ages... well, other than the long way.<br />
<br />
Jenna and Francine found themselves being forcibly buckled into the seemingly massive twin stroller. The two sneered as they found themselves pressed against one another somewhat too close for comfort. <br />
&quot;There we go babies, try to take a nap for your mommies. Nightie night Jenny.&quot; Betty cooed. She then closed a small cover over the stroller, sealing the two inside a somewhat dark space.<br />
<br />
*Note, although speaking in limited baby speech, for convenience sake I&#39;ll translate that into what they&#39;re saying in parentheses*<br />
<br />
(Great, just great. Nice going Jenna) Fran whispered at her friend, folding her arms in dismay.<br />
<br />
(This isn&#39;t my fault) Jenna snapped back, though frustrated by only actually able to say &quot;no me&quot; in response.<br />
<br />
(How is it not your fault) She asked back.<br />
<br />
(You bumped into me Fran. If you waited we&#39;d be in college by now. AND if you listened to my warnings before we wouldn&#39;t be here at all) Jenna defended, though with more simplistic words.<br />
<br />
(Okay Okay... you have the phone still right?) Fran asked, still irritated at wearing a pull up while being pushed in a stroller.<br />
<br />
(Yes) Jenna replied, pulling the phone from her pants. Jenna couldn&#39;t help but marvel at how large it seemed. To her now tiny body, it seemed much more like a tablet than a phone.<br />
<br />
(Okay good, change us back. And keep the brightness down, we don&#39;t want our mothers seeing.... oh, also what happened to them?!) Fran added.<br />
<br />
Jenna sighed as she searched for the app&#39;s icon. (Since we&#39;re little, it made them younger to have us. Being born later means they must&#39;ve just had slightly different lives and therefore personalities)<br />
<br />
(Huh?) Francine replied not understanding the nonsense baby-like babble that the complicated explanation actually came out as.<br />
<br />
(I&#39;ll explain later) Jenna grumbled. Finally, she found the app, relieved to see it still working. She then saw the icons of the surrounding area, and selected on what seemed to be her and Francine&#39;s icon. A sentence generated, and soon Jenna&#39;s weak smile faded to a horrified stare. What looked back at her didn&#39;t seem to be anything she could understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two women are walking in a mall with their 2 year old girls.&quot; Was what it read as, but to Jenna, it seemed more like &quot;$Fh Gre## R@! T)LB$In KO % JEDe T89# #$% & Yqil lhe opps &quot; or something equally nonsensical.<br />
<br />
(Oh no, oh no oh no) Jenna began to panic.<br />
<br />
(What? What&#39;s wrong?) Francine asked.<br />
<br />
(I can&#39;t read this! I can&#39;t read as a two year old!) She began to panic.<br />
<br />
(Well, change something, anything!) Francine began to yell, causing Betty to stop pushing the stroller.<br />
<br />
Jenna heard her younger mother begin to walk towards the opening of the stroller. If she didn&#39;t act now, they could be stuck like this for who knows how long. Or worse, her mother could begin to change things herself. Jenna looked over the sentence. She thought she saw what could be numbers, and if that was the case she just had to make sure they were two digits and they&#39;d be fine right? Or... maybe become ancient... or maybe they weren&#39;t even numbers.<br />
<br />
(Whatever! Here goes nothing... please help me autocorrect!) She called out.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when...</p>
