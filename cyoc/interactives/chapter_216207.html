<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff felt panic in the pit of his now ripped hairy stomach.  He turned, and came face to face with his open locker.  He was in the football team’s locker room at East Valley High, sweating like a pig.  He dropped the helmet to the hard locker room floor, momentarily dazed.  He felt like he was upset about something a moment ago, but he couldn’t remember what. <br />
<br />
“Great game, Jeff,” the voice came from behind, and he got a friendly punch to the bicep.  “Time to hit the showers.”<br />
<br />
Jeff turned, Scott was shucking his gear, grinning.  “We showed them not to mess with the Devils.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jeff responded, still feeling somewhat like he was “watching” this from a distance, but slowly coming to himself as he took all his gear off.  The room felt strange in a way… so big, bustling with noise.  The stench of jock-sweat assaulted his nose, it was everywhere.  Guys were everywhere, stripping down to shower.   Jeff saw a guy (something told him the name was Pete Greene) stripped naked, and did a double-take.  The guy’s muscles weren’t so different from the ones Jeff currently sported, but for some reason he had a hard time tearing his eyes from them. <br />
<br />
“Hey stud,” Scott grabbed his face, and laid one on him.  Jeff was shocked that another dude was kissing him right there in the locker room, and was about to back off and ask what the hell was going on.  But just as quickly he realized how good the lips felt mashing against his own,  and how much of a turn-on the feel of the other jock’s stubble rubbing on his was.  He couldn’t pull away, and leaned into it, part of his mind wondering what this was all about – he wasn’t gay.  But of course Scotty was his boyfriend – they had been going steady for two years now, and he was nuts about him.<br />
<br />
Scotty finally pulled away, his hands framing Jeff’s face.  Scotty had a slight frown.  “Hey… you ok?”<br />
<br />
Jeff stood, just gaping for a moment.  “You’re beautiful,” He realized out loud, unable to peel his eyes from the big, blonde quarterback.  <br />
<br />
“Haha, thanks Jeffy,” Scotty said with a grin.  “You’re not so bad yourself, boyfriend.”  Scott shed his jock strap, and Jeff gave a silent gasp.  Scotty’s cock was big as his own, maybe a little bigger.  But what hit Jeff was the unconscious urge to touch it, to feel it, to suck it, and to feel it inside of him.  He was stunned, trying to make sense of these strange new urges, even as part of his mind told him this was completely normal for a bottom like him.<br />
<br />
“You coming?”<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head, as if trying to clear it from these strange new (perfectly normal) thoughts.  “Yeah,” he said, sitting down to try to hide his own cock, which was quickly hardening.  “Be right there.”<br />
<br />
“’Kay,” Scott grinned, closing his locker and disappearing around corner to the showers.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” Jeff whispered under his breath, his cock fully erect in his lap now.  The smells, the scents, everything about this was so intoxicating to him, he felt like he was losing his mind as the new sensations made him hornier than ever before yet even as it sunk in that he was gay now his new memories were assuring him it was perfectly normal to throw a chubby for his boyfriend.   “I have to get out of here,” Jeff thought to himself, “Before…” He didn’t dare finish that thought, it wasn’t an option, even as a growing part of him was demanding it wasn’t just an option but it was a need.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac.  Jeff started to panic, realizing he didn’t see it anywhere around him.  He had to find the Chronivac before it was too late.  Freaking out, he felt through all the  gear he still had on, then through his stuff sitting on the bench next to him.  Then he rifled through his locker, tossing things out as he did.  Nothing else mattered, he had to find the Chronivac.  But everywhere he looked, he came up empty.  Then he remembered his helmet.  He picked it up from where he dropped it on the locker room floor.  And underneath it, much to his relief, was the Chronivac.  He leaned down to pick it up, still not quite used to his much larger, bulkier body.  It made him feel so big, like a beast.<br />
<br />
Then his heart sank.  Picking the device up, he realized the helmet dropping on top of it had smashed the device.  Beside himself, he tried turning it on anyway.  He tried the REVERT button, hitting it over and over as if it would work if he only hit it hard enough.  Then the button pushed in, not popping back out, clearly broken.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood naked next to his gear and clothes, his big muscle body hard and reeking, the cool of the locker room against his big feet, the smell of sweat filling his nose and adding to the erotic senses he was trying to deny.  To make things worse, Scotty came back around the corner and saw Jeff’s big hard-on pointing right at him.  “Oh fuck.”</p>
