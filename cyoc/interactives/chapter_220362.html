<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Inside the box was...<br />
<br />
Rachel honestly wasn&#39;t sure how to describe it. Some kind of...shifting ball of energy and light. Rachel found herself leaning forward to get a better look at it. What a curious little thing it was. Some kind of crystal ball maybe? Or...<br />
<br />
As she was leaning down to take a closer look, Rachel suddenly felt a sense of vertigo. With a gasp, she threw out her arms, trying to grab on to the door frame to catch herself. She was able to grab onto the frame, but a moment later, felt herself being pulled forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the--?!&quot; Rachel managed to gasp before she was tumbling forward once more.<br />
<br />
And then the swirling mass of energy was engulfing her, and - as impossible as the idea seemed to the poor girl - she was sucked into the box. <br />
<br />
The lid snapped shut as her body disappeared within, and aside from the slight rustling of wind, it was as though there&#39;d never been a girl standing there at all.<br />
<br />
Had anyone been looking, they might have seen a smiling man emerge from around the corner, wearing an odd facsimile of a mailman&#39;s outfit, colored a vibrant purple and complete with a purple cap and purple feather. But on that particular morning, no one was really paying attention, and so, they didn&#39;t notice the oddly dressed man scoop up the package and gently close the front door to Rachel&#39;s house. The man bent low, bowing towards the house, and then, a moment later, vanished from sight entirely, box in tow. <br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
From Rachel&#39;s perspective, everything had gone pitch black.<br />
<br />
She was floating...twisting...in some kind of...endless, meaningless void. She screamed and screamed but her own screams were lost to the expanse around her. There was no light, only odd jumbles of sound and sensation. Tingling ran all throughout her body. At one point it felt like her entire bottom half had gone stiff...almost numb. And it wasn&#39;t long until her hands had joined in on that sensation. Rachel screamed for help, but she was simply...lost.<br />
<br />
Eventually, she realized that she was no longer floating - and perhaps never had been. There was no clear moment of distinction between the two states. Either way, when she went to move, the lower half of her body didn&#39;t respond, and her arms were held fast by - something. Some kind of restraints, perhaps, or encased in some kind of hard shell. She still couldn&#39;t see to know for sure.<br />
<br />
It was still dark, but it wasn&#39;t as dark as...whatever that void had been. She could hear her own ragged breathing now at least. <br />
<br />
&quot;H-hello?&quot; she called. Her voice echoed slightly. Whatever thing she was in wasn&#39;t too large. She tugged at her arms, but they remained stuck. The only thing she could reliably move was her head and shoulders. Not good. Not good at all. Where was she? What had happened? <br />
<br />
Had there been some kind of drug in that box she&#39;d been sent? Something that had knocked her out? It was the only thing she could think of that made sense - and it sent a fresh realization of dread through her. Where the hell was she?? What was she here for?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello??&quot; she called again, more desperately now. &quot;Anyone??&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a sense of movement beneath her, a kind of steady rumbling. Rachel stilled and listened, and a moment later, could hear what sounded like a horse...maybe several? How odd. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?!&quot; she shouted. &quot;Can anyone hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was muffled noise from somewhere outside, but it wasn&#39;t anything she could hear distinctly. She was under some kind of covering...like she was being transported. Was she being kidnapped then? Who the fuck kidnapped people using horses??<br />
<br />
And...there was something else. <br />
<br />
It was the oddest thing. She could &#39;feel&#39; the wooden surface below shaking beneath her - feel it through her feet and other bits of her body - but she couldn&#39;t move those bits in question. Her feet, for one - they were directly on the crate floor beneath her, but...she couldn&#39;t move them at all. Not even wiggle a toe. But she could feel everything fine - an incredibly odd sensation. And...there was something else. It felt like...like she could feel the ground moving like she was sitting on the ground, except - she was in a seated position. If she was strapped to a chair, then how could she so distinctly feel the ground beneath her like that?<br />
<br />
&quot;SOMEONE?? HELP ME!!&quot; she shouted.<br />
<br />
No one responded. <br />
<br />
That wasn&#39;t good. That wasn&#39;t good at all. She&#39;d been kidnapped...was this some kind of human trafficking situation? She&#39;d never heard of anyone being kidnapped via a magic box and a horse though. Unless she was still tripping on some kind of a drug. <br />
<br />
Rachel renewed her efforts to get herself free, but it was to no avail - the lower part of her body was simply too numb and stiff.<br />
<br />
Finally, the footsteps ceased. Rachel&#39;s head whipped around as some kind of tarp was whipped off of wherever she was. Now there were bits of light sneaking through the walls of her prison. Not enough to really see, but enough that she could see she was indeed trapped in some kind of a crate. She felt it rumble again as something lifted the box up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Upsie daisy!&quot; said a voice, followed by a laugh. Through the small shafts in the side of the create she could make out...some kind of a purple outfit. What in the world?<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot; she yelled. &quot;LET ME GO! WHO&#39;S THERE?? HELLO??&quot;<br />
<br />
But no one answered. Rachel broke down into tears, and then let out a soft curse, realizing she couldn&#39;t even wipe them away. <br />
<br />
Her heart was thudding in her chest as the crate seemed to follow after the man - the crate wasn&#39;t rumbling, which was odd. It was almost like the crate was floating after the oddly dressed man.<br />
<br />
&quot;HELP! PLEASE!&quot; she shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry dear, I&#39;m on a schedule, lots to do today!&quot; the man called cheerfully.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the crate settled onto the ground, and the man began to walk off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun now!&quot; he called.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait!&quot; Rachel shouted. &quot;WAIT! COME BACK!! Where - where am I??&quot;<br />
<br />
But he neither turned back nor responded, and a moment later, Rachel was alone in the crate. Outside of it, she could make out a structure of some kind - some kind of home or office maybe. It looked upscale, but also...old. European maybe. Was she somewhere in Europe then? Had she been asleep long enough that she&#39;d been transported across the ocean??<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Rachel whispered. &quot;What the fuck is going on? HELLO? ANYONE???&quot;<br />
<br />
She sat there for a while, trying to move, trying to call out. <br />
<br />
Eventually, she heard the sound of a door opening. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Yay, it came!&quot; It was a girl&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hello??&quot; Rachel called. &quot;Can you hear me? I need help!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course sweetie! Hang on!&quot; the voice responded. Rachel shook her head in confusion. The voice sounded friendly, but...what she&#39;d said before about how it had come left her feeling unsettled. The girl walked off, leaving Rachel alone once more - she waited fretfully, and then, finally, the footsteps returned. &quot;I&#39;ll have you out of there in just a minute!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank you!&quot; Rachel cried. &quot;I...I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, or how I got here, or--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh, shhh, it&#39;s okay!&quot; the girl soothed. <br />
<br />
There was a loud creaking noise, and then, without warning, one of the sides of the crate simply fell away, letting in a bright flash of sunlight. Rachel winced, instinctively trying - and failing - to raise her hand to block it out. <br />
<br />
She blinked against the light, and eventually saw the outline of a cute looking girl, maybe only a few years older than Rachel. It was hard to tell exactly - there was an odd mix of maturity and youth in that smooth face looking at Rachel. And as she looked, the face broke into a grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, hey there!&quot; the girl said. &quot;Wow, you look awesome!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Thank you?&quot; Rachel said, confused.<br />
<br />
And then, finally, she looked down.<br />
<br />
And let out a bloodcurdling scream.<br />
<br />
Her body - it had been changed! <br />
<br />
Her head, shoulders, and the upper part of her arms were still human. But they were the only bits that were. Right beneath her neck, right around the tip of her breasts, her body blended seamlessly into that of a comfy looking armchair. There were two soft looking pillows as well - and a moment later, Rachel realized in horror that those pillows were actually her breasts, morphed to fit the chair. There was a vague outline of a human looking torso underneath, which blended smoothly into the seat of the chair - her upper legs, from what she could tell. Beneath her, though she couldn&#39;t see it - she could feel her legs, having been twisted into the legs of the chair. One of the reasons things felt so odd - two other legs had grown from her ass to become the other two legs of the chair. From her elbows down, her arms blended smoothly into wooden armrests. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what...what...?!&quot; Rachel gasped. &quot;What the fuck?!?&quot; She jerked and strained, but in the end, her body didn&#39;t budge - for there was nothing to break free of. Her body hadn&#39;t been encased inside of a chair. Her body <i>was</i> the chair.<br />
<br />
The girl clapped her hands. &quot;Awww, don&#39;t worry cutie! You&#39;ll get used to it!&quot; And then she stepped forward into the box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get the fuck away from me!&quot; Rachel shouted, flinching her head away. <br />
<br />
The girl simply picked her up, making Rachel feel a fresh sense of vertigo and unreality. Being carried like this just served to highlight how helpless she was now, in this odd form. Grunting, the girl carried her inside, and then set her down near a sectional sofa. <br />
<br />
&quot;N-no...what...I don&#39;t...how can...&quot; Rachel gasped, twisting her head around in every direction.<br />
<br />
The girl closed the front door and sauntered over to Rachel&#39;s chair body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Man, you <i>are</i> a cutie, even if your hair is a little disheveled - don&#39;t worry, I can fix that up!&quot; the girl said cheerfully. &quot;I treat my objects well, you&#39;ll discover!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What...what...did...did you do this to me??&quot; Rachel demanded in a high pitched squeal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, well, duh!&quot; the girl said. &quot;My name&#39;s Keira! I&#39;m your new owner!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-owner?!&quot; Rachel demanded indignantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...yeah!&quot; Keira said. &quot;I needed a new chair, and here you are!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel shook her head in disbelief. This couldn&#39;t be happening. This had to be some kind of fucked up dream, or weird drug trip, or...hell, she wasn&#39;t sure. What was important was that this couldn&#39;t be real. It couldn&#39;t. Things like this didn&#39;t happen. People didn&#39;t get sucked into strange packages, and people certainly didn&#39;t turn into living furniture. Nope, no. She closed her eyes, and shook her head. Nope! Wasn&#39;t real. Weirdest dream ever, she&#39;d have to tell her friends about it. When she opened her eyes, she&#39;d be back in her room, and everything would just be super normal.<br />
<br />
She opened her eyes, and saw the seat of a chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...no...&quot; Rachel gasped, looking around. &quot;No, please, no, this isn&#39;t real! No!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Keira chuckled, and then - to Rachel&#39;s initial horror - began to lower herself into the chair her body had become. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, don&#39;t--&quot; Rachel said. Then she let out a shuddering gasp as Keira&#39;s weight was fully placed onto her new form. She could feel Keira&#39;s body pressing against the fabric of her seat, feel every bit of movement as she settled in against her torso and chest. <br />
<br />
It felt - it felt good. Really good. Warmth flooded her body, and she let out an involuntary gasp that came out in shuddering bits and pieces. Her pussy - still there, apparently, nestled away towards the back of the seat of her new chair body - was pulsing with sudden desire and want. As much as she despised what was going on...it felt SO good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...&quot; Keira muttered. Rachel barely heard her through the haze of pleasure she was feeling. &quot;Needs a bit more padding...&quot;<br />
<br />
Keira turned around and put her hands on Rachel&#39;s pillows. Rachel let out a shocked gasp and threw her head back as she felt a sudden pressure build up within her chest - and felt as the pillows began to fluff up a bit, becoming larger. Her fabric-like skin felt silky smooth under Keira&#39;s touch. Keira gave Rachel a naughty looking smile and then settled back against the newly plump pillows. <br />
<br />
&quot;Much better,&quot; she announced.<br />
<br />
Rachel wanted to speak, to protest, but while Keira was sitting in her, it was pointless; any sentence she tried to form was lost to the haze of warmth and pleasure emanating throughout her body. The only sound she could make were squeaks and gasps of pleasure and desire. And Keira seemed to know this, and relished in it - she&#39;d get up and then reset her weight on Rachel, making her vision go white with the intensity of the pleasure. <br />
<br />
And then Keira was standing up, leaving Rachel feeling cold as the remnants of the pleasurable sensations began to fade. <br />
<br />
&quot;H...holy shit...&quot; Rachel gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwww...see, it feels good!&quot; Keira said with a happy clap. She reached forward and a moment later Rachel let out a surprised scream of pleasure as Keira&#39;s fingers entered into her fabric pussy - she felt the silky material clenching around them and bent her head forwards, letting out a shuddering gasp. Keira, laughing, drew her fingers out with a satisfied looking smirk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you...&quot; Rachel whispered in numb horror. &quot;Let me go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.....nah!&quot; Keira said. &quot;You&#39;re mine now. That&#39;s how it works! Silly mortal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go fuck yourself!&quot; Rachel snapped. &quot;Let me - let me go! LET ME GO! HELP! SOMEONE!!! HELP!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Keira sighed, looking annoyed now. &quot;Yeah, uh, no one&#39;s here to hear you. Well, no one except my little collection here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel slowly looked up at Keira, and then, slowly, over at the rest of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck me,&quot; Rachel whispered.<br />
<br />
The first thing she saw was the coffee table. It was the morphed form of a woman. Stuck in a crab-like walking position, the girl&#39;s body beneath the neck had been turned entirely into wood - a glass surface extended above her twisted form. The head of the girl was looking over at Rachel with a resigned sort of sadness in her eyes. Atop the glass surface was a small bonsai looking tree...except...Rachel let out a new gasp of horror as she realized it wasn&#39;t just a bonsai tree. Not completely. It was also a girl, transformed - her arms had been twisted into the branches of the tree and her lower body, looking mostly human shaped save for the fact that she had a trunk instead of legs - was buried into the soil.<br />
<br />
And then she looked over at the couch - the sectional sofa was actually multiple girls, their bodies bloated up into the various pieces of the couch. Like the table, only their heads remained human looking.<br />
<br />
The TV behind that - another transformed girl, her human head resting atop the screen that her torso and lower body had become. Beyond the room, she could see into the kitchen - the table, the chairs around it. All transformed girls. The oven, the stove, the refrigerator...oh god, even the rug in the room...they were all transformed girls...<br />
<br />
&quot;N....no...&quot; Rachel whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Keira whispered. &quot;You&#39;re mine now. And hey - it&#39;s not like you were doing anything super productive with your life, now were you? Were any of you?&quot; Keira looked around the room. &quot;High school burnouts, college dropouts, deadbeats between jobs...none of you had anything going on, and so, I brought you here - to be useful - to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you&#39;re f-fucking crazy! L...let me go!&quot; Rachel shouted. &quot;LET ME GO!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Keira sighed. &quot;Why must my new pieces always be so temperamental?&quot; she asked with a sad sigh. <br />
<br />
&quot;LET ME GO! LET - ME - GO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Keira leaned down, lowering herself down to Rachel&#39;s eye level - and then kissed her, full on the lips.<br />
<br />
Rachel let out a muffled moan of protest, and then felt an odd sensation flowing through her.<br />
<br />
When Keira pulled away, smirking slightly, Rachel tried to start yelling again. She&#39;d keep yelling until she passed out if she had to! She couldn&#39;t stay here - this couldn&#39;t be real. There had to be a way out of this! There had to be!<br />
<br />
Except she couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Her mouth wasn&#39;t responding anymore. She let out a confused sounding moan. Keira chuckled and held up a mirror - Rachel&#39;s eyes widened - her mouth was simply gone! She tried to curse in surprise, but despite the fact that her jaw moved, no real sound came out, save for a bit of muffled groaning. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like we need to take a minute to ourselves. Have a time out, sweetie. I&#39;ll be back later,&quot; Keira said, walking off. &quot;I suggest you work on your attitude!&quot;<br />
<br />
And Rachel was left there, immobilized, unable to speak, trapped in her own transformed body. She looked around, her whimpered moans becoming more and more desperate. Every inch of her wanted to run, but her body was no longer her own. Even now, she felt the odd emptiness of being left without someone to sit in her. She hated the feeling, and yet, she couldn&#39;t deny it - when Keira had been sitting on her, it had been one of the best feelings of her life. Rachel let out a whimpering moan, looking around - the sight of the other pieces of furniture, bizarre hybrids like her - it only made her feel more desperate. <br />
<br />
The rest of the girls turned furniture in the room looked at her sadly. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is what it is,&quot; the coffee table girl said finally with a sad shake of her head, her blonde hair brushing against the glass surface. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. None of us chose to be here, but...y&#39;know...my name is Penny by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keira is never satisfied,&quot; the TV said morosely. &quot;Sorry, but it&#39;s true. And I&#39;m Ava...but...Keira...she&#39;s always wanting more. More people to transform...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; one of the sections of the sofa said. &quot;We&#39;ve been here for...god, a few years now, I think? What year is it anyway? Oh...sorry. Answer later...my name&#39;s Candy, the one to my left is Steph, and the one on my right is Tiffany. We&#39;ve seen so many of these girls come in...&quot;<br />
<br />
And finally, Rachel had reached her limit. Between the stress of discovering what had happened to her body, to the inability to properly take a breath, to the fear that having her mouth sealed up had brought - it was simply too much. Her eyes closed, her head lulled forward, and she appeared to slump forward like a marionette with it&#39;s strings cut. <br />
<br />
&quot;Could&#39;ve been worse,&quot; grumbled a girl who&#39;s lower body beneath her breasts had been twisted into a metallic birdcage. &quot;A chair&#39;s not so bad, really...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, no shit!&quot; shouted the girl-turned-toilet from the bathroom. <br />
<br />
No one really had any rebuttals to that.</p>
