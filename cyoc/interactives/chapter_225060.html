<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A wave of confusion washed over Jennifer Smith at that moment. She was sitting on the cold bathroom floor with a warm breast in her left hand and a small pink band of flesh in her right. Pressing her vagina between her thumb and forefinger, her mind raced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I going to die? To my God I&#39;m going to die,&quot; she thought, with a growing note of panic.<br />
<br />
Dropping desperately on her thighs, Jennifer began to look for wounds on her flat chests. Fortunately she felt no pain, no wounds, no blood. Just the feel of your hand directly on the skin that covers your ribs and collarbones. She became more relieved and began to breathe more calmly.<br />
<br />
Jennifer then began to examine her breast and vagina, looking for any wounds, cuts, or blood. Fortunately, to his relief, he found nothing. She got up, straightened her panties and gently left her parts inside the bathroom sink, making her chest plug the drain, so that she would suffer the risk of her sex going down the drain. Once her parts were safely tucked away, Jennifer grabbed her other fleshless breast, she examined it, it was just as a little dirty, but it was just as fine as her &quot;twin brother&quot;. Jennifer was even more relieved because, as she examined, she felt her parts still warm, felt his hands touching her, felt her erect breasts and even felt a little pleasure in her clit. Its parts were still alive and he could feel them, even though they were separated from his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;My God! How bizarre is that.&quot; Jennifer looks down at her now flat tits. &quot;I&#39;m looking like a mannequin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jennifer panics again. She was feeling strong between her legs. Jennifer urgently needed to pee.<br />
<br />
Jennifer didn&#39;t know how to do that, whether she would be able to piss or not. Startled, with her hands still a little shaky from the shock, she grabbed her vagina and tried to put it back in place, but her vagina wouldn&#39;t come back, no matter how many times she tried. So Jennifer was forced to make her only other choice. With her vagina in hand, Jennifer holds it by the tip on top of the toilet, like a piece of meat for some animal to eat.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no.&quot; Jennifer stops holding on to one end. The reason is that she felt a mixture of pain and pleasure, because in addition to holding by this tip, Jennifer was accidentally pulling her clitoris and her pubic hair.<br />
<br />
She held the other end of her vagina between her fingers, it didn&#39;t hurt, but she felt the pinch of her fingers. Feeling safe and soothes your urethra and starts pissing.<br />
Jennifer&#39;s urine flowed normally through her separate vagina. However, she had to make some adjustments, as part of her pee hit the lid up. Still, Jennifer managed to get all of her urine, at least most of it, down the toilet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Jennifer spoke relieved, biologically and emotionally. &quot;At least I can pee normally, or almost. Now I understand why the boys&#39; bathrooms are so disgusting. It has a whole technique for aiming.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jennifer&#39;s vagina, moist, slipped between Jennifer&#39;s fingers, falling into the toilet, making a &quot;ploft&quot; in the water. Just like a poop falling down the toilet.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD!!&quot; Jennifer exclaimed, startled as she felt her vagina get cold and wet. Immediately Jennifer reached into the toilet and was able to successfully retrieve her most precious jewel, despite it being wet and watered by her own pee. &quot;Good! It&#39;s safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
A frightening thought ran through Jennifer&#39;s mind: &quot;If my pussy had fallen into the toilet during the flush?&quot; A shiver ran down Jennifer&#39;s spine. &quot;Better not think about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer held the wet pussy with both hands and stepped away from the toilet, closing the lid with her foot. Realizing now that drains and toilets are now a risk to her femininity. In fact, she realized that she would have to take a lot of care now, with her vagina and breasts separated from her body. Because they could fall into the sewer, be lost, stolen, etc.<br />
<br />
As he washed, gently in warm water, his &quot;favorite twins&quot; and his treasure recovered from the mouth of a monster, in the bathtub with the lid on the drain. Jennifer started thinking about her life now with a detachable vagina and breasts. How was she going to explain that to people? How would she hide it from people? Would she be trapped in a lab like a monster? What experiments would you do with it? How would you explain it to your future boyfriends? How would you have sex? How was I going to have children? How would you breastfeed?<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I have children?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at her vagina in her hand, moist and freshly cleaned and started thinking, &quot;Is my pussy still attached to my uterus?&quot; She needed to know.<br />
<br />
Jennifer dries her vagina well, realizing how practical it was to wash and dry her private parts. She puts her vagina on the sink counter, turns on the lights in the mirror, moving it a little to illuminate right on top of her vagina. She covers her index and middle fingers with petroleum jelly and begins to widen her pussy, feeling pleasure and a little pain. It wasn&#39;t the first time she&#39;d done it, he&#39;d already done it, a few months after his first time, after seeing a book by biology, a photo of the cervix. Curious, she opened her vagina and took a picture, and she could see a red ball with an opening, just like the picture in the book. Now she was doing the same thing, and without her cell phone camera, she was able to see the cervix.<br />
<br />
Being able to see what she wanted, she lets go of her vagina, red, moist of vaginal fluids and closing slowly. Still feeling a little tender now, she practically underwent a gynecological examination.<br />
<br />
&quot;So my pussy is connected to my uterus still. So I can still feel pleasure, piss and even have children in the future. But I would have to do it with my pussy and tits apart, for the rest of my life. Something out of Harry Potter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer turned off the water in the tub, grabbed her breasts, floating in the tub, and wiped them dry. Then she wrapped them in a towel along with her vagina and carried her treasures to her room, like a mother holding a newborn baby<br />
<br />
In her room she left them wrapped up on the bed. But she didn&#39;t have time to reflect on her condition, the school bus was coming and she needed to think about what to do with her separate parts.</p>
