<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry turned to her as realisation dawned. His pretty face looked pale and shocked. “The sachet?” she nodded. “So you have….” Alicia nodded again and lifted her own chemise to show her latest possession. The penis had already regained some of its turgor. Alicia held it in her hand and grinned at Henry.<br />
<br />
“But why?”<br />
<br />
“We had to do this swap at some stage. And you were in no state to discuss things with last night. It was late and I had to make a snap decision. Besides I can tell you didn’t like me flirting with the boys last night. Hopefully this assures you that to them I am unobtainable. Won’t Alex be surprised if he tries to make a move on me?”<br />
<br />
Henry just nodded “I really do need to pee. How do you aim?”<br />
<br />
“How do you think? Sit down girl and don’t forget to wipe” Alicia left Henry to explore his new anatomy in private and closed the door.<br />
<br />
Alicia looked for clothes to wear. She hadn’t thought things out very well. She would need the shaper panties Henry was still wearing or else she might experience the same problems he had with the shop assistant. That reminded her. She should check out this girl and see what sort of reaction she got. She now regretted only buying a single panty. She should have bought multiple pairs.<br />
<br />
She looked in her wardrobe knowing she had to choose an outfit for Rachel as well as one for herself. She had a long-sleeved pale green trench dress she had yet to wear on the honeymoon. That should work for Rachel who still needed sleeves. For herself her best bet was probably the strappy bamboo motif sundress she had bought yesterday morning. It was possibly a bit dressy for the golf but would look good at dinner. It would do. <br />
<br />
There was nothing like finding yourself turned into a female to wake you up. After his abolitions (he also ended up doing number twos) using his new orifices and considering he had somehow wet himself Henry decided to just jump in the shower. There he had a moment to come to grips with his most recent changes and explore his new sex, locating the sensitive nub which must be his clitoris. It was interesting that the hole he had just peed out of was separate from his vagina, or was that a vulva? Henry could not remember the correct terminology.<br />
<br />
This was the change he had most feared but at the same time most anticipated. Today was their chance to experience sex from the other side. Could he do that? Could he allow Alicia to penetrate him? He had experienced the knowledge that this change was bound to happen for more than a week. Now it had happened. He thought of Alicia earlier when she was showing off her penis. She seemed eager to try things out. Henry was scared about the prospect but at the same time excited. Just thinking about it had made his nipples harden and was that a moist warm feeling in his groin?<br />
<br />
He showered. Wearing a wig made his scalp oily and itchy it needed a wash. He also had grown to love the feeling of running water on his breasts. That would be something he would miss when all this was over. If he experienced sex as a woman would he later on miss that? Or would he rue the chance of not trying things out when he had the opportunity? What if he liked it? Would that make him gay? All these thoughts swarmed through Henry’s hungover head.<br />
<br />
Eventually he finished, dried and put on the hotel robe to return to the bedroom. He was not ready to be naked in front of Alicia. He opened the door half expecting to see Alicia naked with Mister Marvellous pointing at him. He was relieved to find her brushing her hair and already dressed. She looked her normal feminine self. “I have put an outfit on the bed for you. Get dressed and we can go and have breakfast. This dress should work well on you. It flares out nicely so you may not even need the bike pants. My only request is can I borrow your panty shaper for the day. I think I will need that”<br />
<br />
Henry happily handed her the garment she wanted. Henry watched as she pulled the panty shaper up her legs and adjusted her penis. He warned her “Be careful how you sit. Make sure you don’t squeeze your balls”<br />
<br />
Alicia smiled back in appreciation then went to the bathroom to make up her own face.<br />
<br />
Henry surveyed the clothes Alicia had laid out for him.  Beside the green dress was a pile of pale green underwear. A matching bra, fairly skimpy panties and a camisole, all very satiny and lacy. He pulled on the panties. They were not tight like the panty shaper. They fit snuggly over Henry’s flat groin. He couldn’t say his bum filled out the panties but they stayed up. And the front covered his sex, even if the lace was somewhat transparent. By now he was an expert at putting on a bra. His breasts filled out the cups perfectly. He enjoyed putting on the camisole. The satin felt nice against his skin.<br />
<br />
The dress was shorter than Henry had initially thought. The hem was a good four inches above his knees. His scar was exposed. He did up the belt around his waist. There were no buttons above the belt and the lace at the top of the camisole he was wearing showed. He did it up the best he could but then went into the bathroom to ask for Alicia’s advice. “Is this right? It seems a bit skimpy” <br />
<br />
“It looks good to me. Remember you are a sexy goddess”<br />
<br />
“But my scar is exposed”<br />
<br />
“Something for me to talk about. How you got that scar in the accident that made you mute”<br />
<br />
“But my legs. They are male legs. I can’t wear such a short dress”<br />
<br />
“Have the hairs grown back already?” Alicia bent down and rubbed her hand over Henry’s shin. “Hmm They are a bit rough. It’s only been a few days. Your hairs must grow a lot quicker than mine. Give them a shave and they will be fine”<br />
<br />
Henry found himself using his electric razor on his legs. It only took a couple of minutes before his legs felt totally smooth once more.<br />
 <br />
“Those legs look fine to me. If you wear your heels they would look sensational”<br />
<br />
“I can’t wear heels and play golf” <br />
<br />
“By all means wear your golf shoes while you play just change back into heels when you have finished”</p>
