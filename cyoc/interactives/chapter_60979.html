<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam and Dean were carried into a room with holes in the wall and the caretaker sealed their mouths open with <br />
wax to the walls. All Dean and Sam could do was stare and react as strange dicks were shoved through the holes <br />
into their mouths.  The horny guys must have been lined up to use the glory holes because as soon as one dick <br />
pulled out, another would be shoved in.  The caretaker smiled and sat down with his arms crossed as he heard <br />
the splatting sound of loads filling Dean and Sam's empty metal bodies. <br />
<br />
They had no idea that the holes were enchanted. They had counterparts in mens rooms in truck stops, rest <br />
stops, libraries, bus stations, department stores, sex shops and other public places all across the country. <br />
The boys would soon be filled.  He got up as the metallic sound became a muffled splashing sound. The boys now <br />
each had a least an inch of liquid  lining their tanks.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You two keep up the good work, you adorable little cocksuckers, and in no time I'll have my special liquid <br />
fermented and ready to immobilize my newest statues,&quot; the caretaker said tousling the hair on their heads, <br />
&quot;Now I need to get ready for the fraternity party.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean could only wonder &quot;What fraternity party?&quot; as he gagged on a particularly greasy thick cock that he <br />
imagined belonged to a fat middle-aged Italian trucker.  In fact, it belonged to a slender 20 year old Arab <br />
college student who would be attending the frat party that the caretaker was planning for that night.  Neither <br />
had any idea that the horny young man's load of cum would be fermented and used to turn him into another lewd <br />
sculpture for the mad caretaker's museum.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Adam had gotten bored waiting for Sam and Dean.  It was getting uncomfortably warm, Adam <br />
wondered if some of the wax statues might melt, but they seemed okay.  Still it had to be about 80 inside.  <br />
Adam shucked off his shirt, and jeans and slipped into his board shorts, muscle tee and flip flops.  He <br />
grinned.  When Sam and Dean had come for him, Adam had been planning a trip to the beach and had already put <br />
them in his backpack, which he grabbed as he was led off by his half brothers.<br />
<br />
Adam soon found himself in a hall filled with decadent displays.  There were sculptures of half naked natives <br />
cavorting in a rubber/plastic jungle.  There were tableaus of Greek, Roman and Babylonian orgies. There were <br />
hot college kids at a beach party drinking from a keg. Adam looked around the vast empty hall and stepped into <br />
the beach party display.  He grabbed a plastic cup and tapped the keg.  To his pleasant surprise cold beer <br />
came out. He buried his lips in the frothy white head and downed the entire cup.  Two cups later on an empty <br />
stomach, Adam passed out with his arm draped over a wax coed who had been in an amorous pose on her knees. He <br />
went unnoticed in the display as the caretaker entered with three young fraternity brothers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's the perfect location for you party, boys,&quot; the caretaker said in a saccharine tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great Boomer, Chaz, you got get the stuff, I'll make the final arrangements with the caretaker,&quot; said the <br />
shortest preppiest one of the three.<br />
<br />
As soon as the two bigger frat brothers were gone, Aaron turned to the caretaker, and said, &quot;Okay, I'm holding <br />
up my end. I'm delivering you at least 50 more people for your exhibits maybe 100, and you'll make sure I live <br />
the rest of my life like a king? Then we're done.  This is the last &quot;<br />
<br />
The caretaker grinned. He had gone to great pains to win Aaron over, and he had every intention of fulfilling <br />
his promises as long as Aaron kept supplying him with fresh sculptures. His freshman year, Aaron had been <br />
failing two classes, and the beach party tableau were twelve of his friends that he sacrificed to the <br />
caretaker.  They were all still aware, but immobilized in the same poses for the past 3 years. The caretaker <br />
had somehow changed Aaron's grades and kept them up no matter how poorly he studied.  He would be graduating <br />
with honors thanks to the caretaker. Over the intervening years, he had contributed 34 more friends and <br />
frenemies to the caretaker's museum in exchange for various favors.  This one would be his big score.  His <br />
ticket out.  He purposely kept his back to the beach party exhibit, if he hadn't he might have noticed Adam <br />
lying there.<br />
<br />
The party was a big success.  The fraternity's bus carried out six loads of party-goers to their secret rave. <br />
There were at least 300 young men and women - mostly men- who were drinking heavily, when the caretaker broke <br />
the wax seals and pulled Dean and Sam free from the glory hole service.  They both felt terribly bloated.  The <br />
caretaker could no longer effortlessly lift their hollow bodies.  Instead he used a dolly to wheel each of <br />
them to the party.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa what's with the steel statues?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Special kegs for the party,&quot; the caretaker shouted over the noise.  He wheeled Dean and then Sam over to <br />
where the original two nearly empty kegs were stacked.  He positioned them with their cold metal backs and <br />
buttocks touching back to back.  Then he held out a tap and a hammer.<br />
<br />
Dean stared down.  He couldn't move, but he could guess where that spike of a tap was going to get hammered.  <br />
He would have screamed, but his own mouth was sealed with wax as Sam's detached cock continued to swell and <br />
orgasm down his throat. He could feel Sam's tongue working Dean's own detached cock inside Dean's sealed lips.<br />
<br />
BANG TAP!<br />
<br />
Dean's entire being vibrated as the tap penetrated his crotch. Boomer was the first to try the new manshaped <br />
keg. He grabbed the spigot which seemed to have become part of Dean.  Dean could feel it like it was a second <br />
cock, as Boomer yanked and twisted it, and the cold fermented liquid flowed out of Dean and into Boomer's cup.<br />
<br />
Condensation began to appear on Dean's surface.  At least that's what any of the partiers would interpret the <br />
water droplets as.  Dean knew it was his sweat.  He had no idea he could cum that often or on demand, but <br />
apparently that was what the keg tap did to him. Soon, the Arab who had used his mouth earlier had his hands <br />
on Dean's tap.  He slowly filled his cup to avoid too much foam. Dean would have moaned if he could have. <br />
<br />
Sam didn't quite understand what was happening to Dean.  He knew something was going on because Dean's cock <br />
was behaving madly inside his mouth. It was practically raping his throat. <br />
<br />
The caretaker came around and squeezed Sam's metal cheek, he whispered, &quot;Don't feel left out, sweet cheeks, as <br />
soon as Dean's tapped out it will be your turn.&quot;  He handed Aaron a second tap and a hammer, &quot;Here when the <br />
first keg is nearly empty tap this one. And then you'll spend eternity like a king.&quot;<br />
<br />
The caretaker exited the party, and walked down the hall to another new exhibit he was working on. It was a <br />
lavish version of Versailles Palace. He looked over the details, and then went to the wig rack, and costume <br />
rack that one of his workers had left for him.  He picked out an appropriate silk brocade outfit that should <br />
fit Aaron, then narrowed it down to two wigs.  He decided he would wait until Aaron was mounted in the display <br />
to put the wig on him. <br />
<br />
At the party Aaron tipped back the blue vial of liquid that the caretaker had given him. It tasted different <br />
this time, but it had worked every time before to keep him from being immobilized like his friends.  He had <br />
assumed they had died, but he would soon learn that they were all still alive but immobilized.<br />
<br />
The caretaker had to work quickly.  The fraternity bus had to be down by the railroad tracks before sunrise.  <br />
The police who would go looking for the missing college kids might visit the museum, but the caretaker would <br />
make sure that the trail led to a seedy warehouse down by the railroad tracks which had been built over an <br />
abandoned mine.  The mine was flooded and collapsed recently thanks to the caretaker, and most probably the <br />
authorities would treat it as a mass grave for the missing fraternity party goers.<br />
<br />
The caretaker was so excited at how his plans were coming together that he had gone online to place newspaper <br />
ads touting his latest new exhibits. In the mean time, Adam was waking up at the party.  At first he thought <br />
he was dreaming, but then he realized it was real. He worked his way through the throng of dancing bodies <br />
until he got to the kegs. Then he stopped and stared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dean?&quot; he asked.</p>
