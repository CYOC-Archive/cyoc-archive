<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was already the end of the first night at the Inn as some of the people were turning in.  But for Jeff and Amy, their night has already begun.  As promised, they decided to wrap up their first night to the Jacuzzi that was in their room.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom, Mike was dressed in his white robe with his swim trunks underneath it.  As he was looking into the mirror, he started to reflect what transpired for the first day.  At first, it was a meant to be an interesting day for the week as a husband/father, going out with Amy for this supposed anniversary and would play along with it until the week is over.  But since they got here, Jeff could feel something off since they arrived.  His old memories were fading and new memories resurfaced, making him starting to believe he was actually a husband and a father.  Not to mention Amy&#39;s supposed interment relationship with him was giving Jeff some conflictions.  She was suppose to be his sister before a slight judgement of error has caused Amy to become a mother and wife when Jamie became a teen.  Even as he try to tell himself she&#39;s his little sister, it was getting harder to believe it as he sees her more and more as a wife.  It&#39;s like related by blood anymore, but by marriage.  It felt so wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;She&#39;s your wife, it&#39;s not wrong.&#39; A voice said to him.<br />
<br />
Jeff heard that voice and looked around to see where it was coming from.  That&#39;s when he looked back into the mirror to see his reflection talking back to him with a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah, that&#39;s right, Jeff.  It&#39;s me, the husband side of you that you keeping fighting back against.  The real me.&#39; Jeff&#39;s reflection said to him.<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked and couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing.  It was like before then they entered the inn, only this time, it seems evident.  &quot;I...  I don&#39;t understand...  How is that possible?  I&#39;m me?&quot;  Jeff began to respond quietly so as to not worry Amy.<br />
<br />
The reflection chuckled and asked, &#39;Are you...  You seem to be a little confused.  It&#39;s no wonder why you are holding back going the distance with Amy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Amy and I are...&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Happily Married with a 16 year-old daughter to prove it.  Jeff, you are madly in love with her.  Protecting her from that drunk college punk proves it.&#39; Jeff&#39;s reflection said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because she&#39;s my little sister.  I have to protect her from bullies and creeps.  It&#39;s what an older brother can do.&quot; Jeff explained to his reflection.<br />
<br />
&#39;Did you really threw that punch at that asshole because you were protecting your sister, or did you do that to protect your wife.  C&#39;mon Jeff.  You know you can&#39;t fight this forever.  This IS your life.&#39; the reflection told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No it&#39;s not.  This is meant to be temporary, only for the week.  And once it&#39;s over, we&#39;ll be all back to normal, like none of this ever happened.&quot; Jeff said to his reflection.<br />
<br />
&#39;Really? But everyone seems a lot happier don&#39;t they?  Think about it, Mary was sad and alone before Joey, now they&#39;re happily married and are now Amy&#39;s parents and have a grandchild that they&#39;re proud of.  Jamie had to deal with the loss of her husband, now she gets a chance to start over again as a teenager and meet new friends, maybe even a boyfriend.&#39; Jeff&#39;s reflection said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boyfriend? I&#39;m not letting my little girl date.&quot; Jeff suddenly said as his adult side took over and made the same movements in the mirror as he did before shaking it off.  Sighing, he said, &quot;Jamie...er...mom is more responsible then me.  She knows how to control herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Please, Jeff...  You can&#39;t bullshit yourself out of this.  It was hard enough for Jamie to take care of three kids alone. <br />
 Now it&#39;s just you and Amy raising Jamie.  Why not celebrate what you two have?&#39; Jeff&#39;s adult side suggested as the real Jeff turned away.<br />
<br />
&#39;Look, deny all of this all you want, but you know that is the truth.  Jamie is happy re-living her teenage life with friends and a second chance.  Joey and Mary are enjoying each others time together as a proud elderly couple with a daughter they raised and a grand-daughter they spoil.  And you and Amy...  Well...  Let&#39;s just say the days of the two of you being siblings is over.  You said that it&#39;s only temporary, but you can&#39;t fight this urge forever.  Soon you will cave in to your true desires.  You will surrender your old life and accept this new one.  And once you do, you will enjoy it.  I guarantee it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was going to argue to his reflection until he heard a knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, dear, I have everything set outside for our special night in the Jacuzzi.  Are you almost done?&quot; Amy asked from the other side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, sorry, I just...&quot; Jeff looked to the mirror to only see his own reflection starring back at him and not the husband side. &quot;I just had to go real quick.  All that drinking at the bar gave me quite the bladder.&quot; Jeff said flushing the toilet, pretending that he had taken a piss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, why don&#39;t you wait outside for me?  I have a...special surprise waiting for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that, Jeff was perking up and was curious what the surprise was.  &quot;Coming out, sweetie.&quot; he said as he washed his hands and left the bathroom, wondering what surprise she has for him.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in Joey and Mary&#39;s home, Jamie was in the bathroom, washing up for dinner.  Looking up at the mirror, she was thinking back what happened to her a bit back.  The fact that she actually is going out with Antonio tomorrow after school.  It was quite a shock to her.  Sure, it&#39;s just them going out for a drink, but to her, it feels like her first date with him.  She soon wondered and envisioned how that will go down by tomorrow.  It was going to be quite exciting...<br />
<br />
But...  Somehow...  It just doesn&#39;t sound right.  Jamie knows that she is still a mother of three kids and Antonio was Jeff&#39;s best friend.  But with Jeff and Amy, her middle son and younger daughter, becoming a husband and wife/father and mother and Joey, the eldest son, becoming the grandfather.  The family dynamic has changed dramatically.  Combine that with the fact that she&#39;s back to being a teenager, she was gaining a crush on Antonio and this little date wasn&#39;t helping matters.  Splashing water on her face, Jamie wondered if it was right dating Jeff&#39;s friend.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh...  But it is right...&#39;<br />
<br />
Jamie soon heard that voice and shot up to find out where it was coming from.<br />
<br />
&#39;Right in front of you, sweetie&#39;<br />
<br />
Looking ahead, she discovered something quite surprising.  Right in front of her is herself, but unlike her with a shocked expression, this one has a devilish grin and sultry look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who...Who are you?&quot; she asked the reflrection, trying to keep her voice down so her grandparents wont notice.<br />
<br />
&#39;Why...I&#39;m you.&#39; the reflection said, &#39;The real you.  The one that wishes you let go of this doubt and concern and experience this new life.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jamie blinked and didn&#39;t know what was going on.  &quot;But...that&#39;s impossible.  You can&#39;t be me.  I am me.  I am a mother of three great children and-&quot;<br />
<br />
The reflection laughed it off and said, &quot;You?  A mother?  Darling, you don&#39;t look like a mother anymore.  Your are a teenage high schooler with a new lease on life, friends that look up to you, and a special someone wanting to be with you.  You have a loving mother and an overly protective father along with kind grandparents that raise and nurture you.  What makes you think you are middle age hag?&#39;<br />
<br />
Jamie heard that and was upset, reminding her reflection, &quot;Because I always remembered I was a mother even before the Jeff showed me the Chronivac.  I have always been a mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh really...?&#39; the reflection said with a raised eyebrow, &#39;Can&#39;t you feel the restriants breaking in your mind.  Your old memories slowly fading away while new memories surface.  Admit it, doll, you love being a teenager again.  You only need to let go of those petty thoughts and embrace what you have gotten.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jamie shook her head and reminded her reflection, &quot;But it was meant to last for a week.  And once it&#39;s over I will be-&quot;<br />
&#39;Back to your miserable life as a single mother with no husband, raising three kids on your own while your life drains away.&#39; the reflection reminded her, &#39;Jamie...look around you.  Your grandmother is happier now with Joey being the grandfather.  Your mom and dad are now happily married and created and raised you the right way.  And you...heh, heh...that huge bolder filled with responsibilities and hopelessness has finally been lifted off your shoulder and you don&#39;t have to worry about petty things like jobs and marriage.  Now, you can re-experience high school again with new friends and...get a change to find love again with Antonio.  You saw the way he looks at you and treats you so kindly.  Imagine what would happen on that date.  Who knows...maybe you get your first kiss and-&#39;<br />
<br />
Jamie immediately back away as the reflection did the same.  &quot;I can&#39;t date Antonio!  He&#39;s Dad-er-Jeff&#39;s best friend!  If he finds out, he&#39;s going to ground me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well, duh!  It&#39;s because he is your father, always protecting you from potential worse case scenarios.  But you already knew that, don&#39;t you.&#39; the reflection said as Jamie turned away and closed her eyes tight.  &#39;Look, I get you are feeling conflicted, but think of it like this.  You never found love since Mike passed away and what are the chances of a middle age woman that you once were finding someone that would fill that gap.  Now you get your chance again, only this time, as a teen girl with so many opportunities ahead of her, including finding young love.  You can&#39;t squander your chances.  Just accept the teen life and go out with Antonio.  After all, you deserve it...all of it...&#39;<br />
<br />
Jamie was trying to stop the voice on the reflection from pushing her as she heard a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie?  Sweetie?  Everything all right in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie heard her grandmother&#39;s voice and turned to see the reflection was normal again.  With a sigh, she said, &quot;Yeah...  Everything is fine.  I was just...thinking about tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a bit of silence until the grandmother on the other end said, &quot;Ah...  That&#39;s just sweet...  Why don&#39;t you come down and discuss about it at dinner.  I have made your personal favorite.  Think of it as the start of the week with your grandparents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that, her mind darted back to a new memory surfacing that Grandmother cooks her favorite dish whenever she visits.  That thought caused her to smile and made her forget about what she experiences just now as she turned to the door and said, &quot;Okay!  I&#39;m coming!&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning off the faucet, she dried her hands and left the bathroom to be with her grandparents at dinner.  Of course, with what Jeff and Jamie had just experience, was only the beginning.</p>
