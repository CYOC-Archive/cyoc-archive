<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd’s ears perked up at the sound of the door to the dorm room opening. He looked over his shoulder to see Sam closing the door behind him. When he turned, Todd could see the smile on the tiger’s face. The wolf stood up from his desk and turned to face the tiger.<br />
<br />
“H-How is he?” Todd asked. “Is he d-doing any better?” Sam nodded his head, which made the wolf sigh in relief as he sat back down. “Th-That’s good. What d-did you do?”<br />
<br />
“I took him to a music shop in town,” Sam said. “He seemed to really cheer up when he started playing some of the instruments. He’s not too bad on the guitar.” The tiger proceeded to walk over to his bed and sit on the edge. “What have you been up to while I was out?”<br />
<br />
I’m “Oh, n-nothing,” Todd said. “Just a b-bit of studying, though it was k-kinda hard to focus thanks to my c-clothes. I think I m-might start going commando…”<br />
<br />
Sam laughed. “You’re only now considering going commando?!” he asked. “Dude, I started going commando the day my lower body transformed! How have you been going that long with them on?!”<br />
<br />
Todd blushed a little in embarrassment. “I g-guess I’m still getting used to the new r-rules of this world,” he admitted sheepishly. “It has b-been a bit weird wearing a s-shirt…”<br />
<br />
“Then don’t wear one!” Sam said enthusiastically. “I’ve actually considered not wearing tank tops anymore. They don’t agitate me like my boxers did, but I’m not much of a fan of how tight they are. Plus, it would allow me to show off my core.”<br />
<br />
“Y-You should!” Todd exclaimed. “I-I mean, you shouldn’t! Wait, no I-I mean…” The wolf found himself trailing off as his boyfriend took off his tank top, revealing his toned core. No matter how many times he saw Sam without his shirt, it still made him drool a little. The tiger smirked at his boyfriend’s reaction and made a “come here” motion with his finger. Todd immediately began taking his clothes off, throwing them to his side of the room before jumping into Sam’s open arms, nuzzling his head on his boyfriend’s pecs. Sam quickly slipped his pants off and wrapped his arms around Todd, keeping the wolf close to him. <br />
<br />
“I love cuddling with you like this,” Sam said, petting Todd’s head. “We should really do this every night.”<br />
<br />
“I mean, we c-could. I’ll just start s-sleeping in your bed with you.”<br />
<br />
“I’d like that a lot.”<br />
<br />
Todd lifted his head and began to get up, making Sam release the wolf from his grasp. The wolf then leaned in and began to passionately kiss his boyfriend, pushing his flat canine tongue into the tiger’s mouth. Sam moaned into their kiss, snaking a hand down towards his boyfriend’s growing erection. <br />
<br />
The sound of a phone vibrating made Sam reluctantly break his kiss with Todd, making the wolf let out a whine. “It’s p-probably just a spam call…” he said, putting a hand on Sam’s shoulder in an attempt to drag him back into the kiss. “Ignore it.” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, but I want to check. Just to be safe, you know?” The tiger picked up his phone, fully expecting Todd to be right about it being a spam call. He looked at the caller ID.<br />
<br />
<b>Mom</b><br />
<br />
Sam’s eyes widened and he quickly pulled the phone closer. Todd noticed the panicked expression on his boyfriend’s face and grew concerned. “What’s wrong b-babe?”<br />
<br />
“It’s my mom. She’s calling me. I…I don’t know what to do! Do I pick up? Do I let it go to voicemail? Should I call her back later?”<br />
<br />
“P-Pick up! It’s your m-mom! You have to answer!”<br />
<br />
“But we’re naked! I don’t want to talk to my mom while I’m naked!” <br />
<br />
“Answer h-her. I’ll get your sh-shorts.”<br />
<br />
Todd hopped off the bed and grabbed his and Sam’s shorts, while the tiger hesitantly pressed the answer button. He held his phone up to his ear. “Hello?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you finally picked up!” His mother’s cheerful tone couldn’t help but make him smile. “You’ve gone almost a week without calling us! I was starting to get worried!” His mother had always been one to grow concerned when she didn’t hear from anyone after a while. He had promised that he’d call at least once a week to check in with her. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry mom,” Sam apologized, grabbing the pair of shorts that Todd handed to him and quickly put them on. “I’ve just been so caught up with everything that’s been happening.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I understand sweetheart. You’re at the school of your dreams meeting new anthros and making new friends. You are making friends, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah! Of course I am, mom! I’ve made a bunch of friends already! There’s Milo, Dare, Curtis, Mark, Ol…” The tiger found himself trailing off as he went to say Ollie’s name. Of course he thought of the sheep as a friend, but with him leaving the college to go back to the other side…<br />
<br />
“Sam? Honey? Are you still there?” His mom’s voice snapped him out of his thoughts. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m still here mom,” Sam responded quickly. “Sorry…I just spaced out for a second there. Trying to think of everyone I’ve made friends with.”<br />
<br />
“And how about your roommate?” his mom asked. “Are you getting along with him? Didn’t his name start with a ‘T’?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Todd.” The wolf looked up upon his name being mentioned. <br />
<br />
“You didn’t say his name when you were listing your friends. Sweetie, you’re getting along with him, right? He’s not bullying you, is he? You can still transfer rooms and get a new roommate.”<br />
<br />
“No, mom, he’s not bullying me,” Sam replied, watching Todd stifle a laugh at the thought of him bullying the much larger tiger. “He’s not really my friend though. He’s…something more than that…” <br />
<br />
Sam’s mom didn&#39;t immediately respond, making the tiger a bit worried. He knew that both his parents were very accepting. After all, Mike was gay and they supported him unconditionally, so why would it be any different with him? After a few more seconds of silence, Sam’s mom finally spoke up. <br />
<br />
“So you’re attracted to men like Mike is?” she asked. <br />
<br />
“Yeah…I’m gay, mom. Sorry for not telling you or dad sooner.” <br />
<br />
“Sweetie, you don’t need to apologize to me,” his mom said. “I don’t care whether you like men, women, both, or neither. I only care that you’re happy, and if you’re truly happy, then I’m happy as well.”<br />
<br />
Sam couldn’t help but cry a little upon hearing his mom’s words. She was the complete opposite of his old mother. Quite frankly, he no longer thought of that woman as ever being his mother. He wasn’t human. He was a tiger, just like his mom. <br />
<br />
“Is Todd around?” his mom asked. “I’d like to speak to him, if you don’t mind.” Sam looked over at Todd, who had climbed back onto the bed with him. He pulled the wolf close to him and put his mom on speaker. “Yeah, he’s here mom. I put you on speaker. Say hi Todd.”<br />
<br />
“H-Hi Mrs. Sam’s Mom…” the wolf said timidly. “Y-You raised an incredible y-young man. I c-can’t put how much he’s h-helped me come out of my shell into w-words.”<br />
<br />
“Aww, aren&#39;t you sweet!” Sam’s mom replied. “You sound like such a charming young man yourself. Now, I want you to make sure that Sam gets all his school work done and studies for all his classes. Make sure he wakes up on time for his classes and goes to bed at a reasonable hour every night. And make sure to take good care of my son, okay?”<br />
<br />
“Mom…” Sam groaned. Todd laughed quietly, finding it sweet how caring Sam’s mom was. <br />
<br />
“I’ll do m-my best ma’am,” he replied, a blush on his muzzle. <br />
<br />
“Good. And Sam, be sure to treat your future husband with respect!” <br />
<br />
“MOM!”<br />
<br />
Sam’s mom laughed. “I’m only kidding honey! Anyway, I have to go. I loved hearing your voice again Sam. And it was great to meet Todd as well, at least not in person. When you come home sometime, be sure to bring Todd with you! We’ll have a big family dinner with your brother and Adam. I’m sure they’d both love to meet Todd as well!” <br />
<br />
“Okay, I will mom. I love you.”<br />
<br />
“Love you too sweetheart. Call again soon!” <br />
<br />
“I will, I promise. Bye mom.”<br />
<br />
“Bye Sam.”<br />
<br />
Sam hung up the phone and put it back on his nightstand before laying his head back and staring at the ceiling. Almost immediately after, he felt his shorts being pulled down, and Todd’s furry body climbed on top of him. <br />
<br />
“You’re mom s-seems really nice,” the wolf said. “A bit f-forward though. I mean, f-future husband? It seems a b-bit soon to say that.” Sam laughed and shook his head in agreement. <br />
<br />
“Even though we got into this relationship pretty quickly, I don’t want to rush things,” he said. “Although, when we’ve both graduated, I would be more than happy to propose.” Todd blushed and leaned to resume their earlier make out session, gently squeezing Sam’s large pecs as he did. <br />
<br />
“I’d l-love that more than a-anything.”<br />
<br />
The wolf buried his nose in Sam’s fur, losing himself in the tiger’s masculine scent. He let out a shaky moan as Sam’s masculine musk flooded his nostrils. <br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Husband...&quot;</i> he thought, blushing at the idea of him and Sam in suits with all their friends gathered to watch them get married. <i>&quot;We&#39;ll get there one day. I know we will.&quot;</i></p>
