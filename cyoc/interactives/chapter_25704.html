<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heather turned into the girl’s bathroom just as the “late bell” rang.  She pushed through the line of students who were rushing out of the bathroom and running down the hall in an effort to avoid detention.  Heather regretted ditching her language arts class.  She was fond of her teacher, Ms. Cooper, and was really enjoying the subject this semester, it was called “Where the Wild Things Are.”  They had started by reading the children’s book of that title by Maurice Sednak on the first day of class – easy enough – then went onto more advanced novels of the same theme, <u>Heart of Darkness</u>, <u>Deliverance</u>, even <u>Tarzan</u>.  The idea was to explore what happens when civilized man goes into the wilderness and discovers that he’s the most uncivilized creature there.  Ms. Cooper had a real passion for the material and shared it with the class.<p>

But she had no time for such concerns now.  She waived her hand to clear the smoke that lingered from the girls that had used the bathroom as their private smoking room and breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that none of them were present at the moment.  She ducked into a stall and loosened her jeans.  Something felt strange as she slipped her hands in to lower her pants – a soft, fuzzy feeling against her hands.  Heather looked down in dismay.  There was hair, no, it was too thick for that, this was fur that was covering her stomach from her bellybutton down.  Dropping her pants to her knees, she saw that the growth had continued down the inside of her thighs all the way to her knees.  Though she was always meticulous in grooming her pubic area – opting for a ‘landing strip’ or less if the mood hit her, the fur was erupting from the sides of her panties demonstrating that she had clearly acquired a ‘retro-bush.’  Raising her right arm high in the air, Heather peered into her blouse to look at her arm pits.  Sure enough, there too, it looked as if her personal grooming skills had gone to pot.<p>

Worse yet, the tugging of her pants had increased the wonderful sensation of warmth and arousal in her crotch.  Her panties grew wet and Heather’s nose was overcome by an enticing, pungent, musky scent brought on by the moistening of her pussy.  Curiously, Heather slipped a trembling finger over her furry belly and into her underwear.  Brushing every so slightly against her clit brought on a sensation of pure pleasure unlike anything Heather had ever experienced in her life.  Her knees bucked and she grabbed the top of the stall with her free hand to keep her balance.  Heather moaned in excitement before slipping her finger deep within her wet pussy.  That act elicited what could only be described as a howl of delight.<p>

Heather immediately realized she had made a mistake.  Her loud noises were sure to attract attention from the faculty member monitoring the halls this period.  Heather quickly pulled up her pants and tried to compose herself before venturing into the hall and heading to Ms. Cooper’s classroom.<p>

She was not quick enough though, as the door to the bathroom swung open.<p>

“Okay, who’s in here?  And let me see your hall pass,” the person entering the room said before Heather could even identify them.<p>

<hr>

Back at Lisa’s home, Wendy shifted backward in the loveseat as Lisa towered over her.  She maintained eye contact with Lisa.  In the first place, she had been trained to do this to maintain a level of dominance over a would be attacker.  In the second place, she wanted to be sure Lisa didn’t notice her reaching into her pocket to retrieve the small mace like container of aerosol silver nitrate that she carried.  She had been skeptical when the ordinance officer had issued it to her, but now she prayed it would keep her safe.<p>

Lisa closed her eyes and breathed in again.  She smiled, almost as though she was aroused by the scent.<p>

Wendy made her move.<p>

She pushed Lisa backward, knocking over her and the chair she’d been sitting in, and brandished her bottle of silver salvation.<p>

Lisa recovered quickly and was about to lunge at Wendy when the agent ordered, “Stand Back!”<p>

“I assume you know what this is, and what it’ll do to you,” Wendy said confidently.<p>

“Oh, my,” Lisa said, feigning fear.  “One of the government’s little party favors I see.”<p>

“Yes,” Lisa continued, “I should be afraid.  That little bottle would certainly be enough to take down one, little werewolf, even a powerful alpha like me.”<p>

Wendy listened as she backed through the living room and into the foyer.  The front door was on her right.  She was steps away from the it and freedom.  She’d seen enough.  It was time to call in the cavalry.  A charge of threatening a federal officer ought to knock Lisa down a peg.<p>

“Of course,” Lisa continued.  There was a twinge of mocking indignation in her voice, “I wouldn’t be scared in the least if I wasn’t alone.  Hell, I’d be down right cocky if I had some of my pack mates here to protect me.”<p>

At that, Wendy heard a rustle of footsteps from the dining room behind her.  Wendy spun around.  There was the black woman, Ebony, that Wendy had been briefed on standing in the doorway.<p>

Wendy heard another noise.  A fair woman with fine features and short black hair was descending the stairs.  It was Solange, the French woman in the group.  She stopped at the foot of the staircase.<p>

Wendy turned again as she heard the front door open.  Anaya, the Hispanic target of the investigation, smiled as she locked the deadbolt on the door behind her and tucked the key into the pocket of her jeans.<p>

Finally, Wendy turned back to Lisa, but she was no longer alone.  Sharon, Wendy knew her as the newest initiate into the coven stood at Lisa’s side.<p>

Wendy assumed a fighting crouch as the quartet of women silently advanced on her.  They remained at just over twice an arms length distance from Wendy as she turned in a slow 360 to keep an eye of each of them.  They couldn’t grab her, but, then again, she couldn’t grab them either.  The women, for their part began to circle around Wendy.  Each had a predatory glare in their eyes.  Wendy hoped silently that one of these woman was the subject of today’s limited surveillance and the teams resources were not being wasted on the gym teacher, Brenda McDonald or that real estate agent, Debra Peters.<p>

“You see, Wendy,” Lisa offered, “each member of the pack is thoroughly devoted to the others.  Of course, as the alpha, any of my sisters would lay down their life for me.  But I wouldn’t ask them to do it unless it was absolutely necessary.”<p>

“What do you want from me?” Wendy asked.<p>

“I told you,” Lisa said with a smile.  “I’m impressed by you.  I’m impressed by your abilities.  You’re quick, intelligent and cunning.  Why, even getting yourself into your present, rather compromised position deserves some accolades.  Anybody else would probably still be sitting in that loveseat trembling in fear.”<p>

Lisa paused to let her praise sink in.  “I want you to join us, Wnedy.  Join my pack.  Become a werewolf.  Pledge your allegiance to the moon, to your pack sisters and to me.<p>

“You’d be quite a valuable asset to our group based on your abilities alone.  But you bring something far more useful to the table.  Your position in the government would be invaluable to me.  I have spies, yes, but they are only friends or friends of friends.<p>

“If I were to have one of my own, a sister, in your position, there’s no telling how far we’d be able to go!”<p>

“And if I refuse?” Wendy asked.<p>

“Well,” Lisa said, picking at her nail with an exaggerated frown on her face, “I’ve had lunch already, but my girls here haven’t eaten yet…”<p>

Lisa looked at Wendy with searing, luminescent yellow eyes, “… and I hate to be a bad hostess and not offer them a snack.”<p>

Wendy’s heard skipped a beat as she heard the four women surrounding her growl softly.</p>
