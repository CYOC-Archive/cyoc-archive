<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;FUCK school,&quot;  Kyle yelled, staring straight at Jennifer.  He was sweating, veins standing out.  Jennifer couldn't see any of the old, dorky kid in Kyle's eyes.  Now he was all animal.  An aggressive animal.  &quot;And FUCK you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer backed up.  Kyle followed, as if her moving had drawn him forward.<br />
<br />
A quick glanced at Kyle's crotch made her realized that, maybe, Kyle meant the &quot;FUCK&quot; literally. <br />
<br />
'So this is what it is like to be the deer caught in the headlights,' popped into her mind, as she backed into the wall, in the cramped space between the toilet and the counter.  A half used roll of toilet paper pressed into her leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;K-Kyle, you don't want to do this,&quot; she heard her shaky voice plead, unconvincingly.  &quot;Wha--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm still a god damned virgin,&quot; he shot back, interrupting her.  Her was (Oh God!) starting to remove his pants!  &quot;That ends.  NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but, what if your mom hears?&quot; she asked, surprised at how meek her voice sounded.  &quot;What'll she think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's almost eight.  She's too drunk to notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Huh?' Jennifer thought.  Wasn't Kyle's mom some sort of health nut?  Jen suddenly realized that there was an ash tray, hubcap sized and overflowing, on the, now filthy, counter top.  Neither the ash tray nor the filth had been there when she entered...<br />
<br />
&quot;She's been drunk ever since my asshole dad took off,&quot; Kyle continued, now bare from the waist down.<br />
<br />
She had to think of something quick.  Something other than all the worst case scenarios which kept flashing through her mind, most ending with her body being dumped somewhere, that is.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't get how it happened, but now I am a SKATER GOD!  My dad's gone.  And mom's drunk all the time.  You're in my bathroom.  An' I'm horny as hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was now practically on top of her, and he smelled as if he hadn't bathed for a week.  He reeked of sweat, smoke (possibly not from tobacco), oil and dirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You made me, now you'll enjoy me,&quot; he announced, forcing a long, rough kiss on her mouth.  It seemed to go on forever (the guy had good lung!), and managed to be more terrifying than romantic.<br />
<br />
Made him...<br />
<br />
He broke off the kiss and began fumbling with her shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;KYLE!&quot; Jennifer shouted desperately.  &quot;TRANSFORM OR DARE!!!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle stopped and looked puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, yes?&quot; he asked more than answered, maybe thinking it the safest answer.  Or maybe he really hadn't heard what she said...  The latter seemed more likely, since when he paused his right hand had found its way inside her bra.  It was still there... leaving bruises.<br />
<br />
&quot;That means you get both,&quot; Jennifer panted, now trying to figure out what to actually say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Kyle.  There seemed to be some sort of conflict going on inside his head.  The wrong side seemed to be winning.  &quot;Screw it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He went back to trying to undress her, attempting to pull her bra over her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it!  Stop it,&quot; Jennifer shouted.  She forced herself to take a breath.  &quot;I DARE you to stop what you are doing and stand still in the middle of the room!&quot;<br />
<br />
The large, well muscled man immediately stopped trying to pull her bra off, leaving it uncomfortably half off her left breast.  The fact it was still inside her shirt was good enough.<br />
<br />
Of course, standing still didn't do anything to stop his mouth...<br />
<br />
&quot;What's happen', bitch?!  Why can't I move?!  C'mon, let me go so I can fuck you!  Let me screw you, bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer forcibly tuned him out.<br />
<br />
Crap.  She couldn't just leave him there screaming.  People would eventually find him, and possibly put two and two together after she'd fucked the basketball team and boasted about it to all her friends...  Shit!  She'd forgotten about that.  Somehow things had gotten WAY out of control.  And now, with adrenaline slowly leaving her system, she had to admit she'd done her part.  And, maybe, smart and stupid wasn't such a sexy combination after all.  It would be a shame to waste such a nice body, though...<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she began.  Kyle kept talking, not noticing she was trying to say something.  Hopefully he didn't have to actually hear him.  &quot;For your transformation.  Well, being stupid DEFINITELY isn't working.  So, for starters, you get your smarts back.  Oh, what the hell-- you get to be a genuine genius.  But, you don't get your old personality back, and this one is RIGHT OUT!  You'll be the kind of guy who knows what a women wants and how to treat her, the kind of guy all the women at school fight over.  However, you'll only be interested in me, and only as long as I want you to be interested in me.  You got that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle had stopped talking, and was looking very confused.  A look of horror came over the handsome young man's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, Jen!  I don't know what came...&quot;  He trailed off, thinking.  Kyle's brain was processing the last few minutes...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that seemed to work,&quot; she decided, letting out a breath she hadn't realized she was holding.  She looked at Kyle, still standing, pantless, in the middle of the room.  &quot;By the way, you can move now.  That, and, please put your pants on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare!  Transform or dare, Jen.  You used it, didn't you?  Shit!  Now I've asked it to you,&quot; Kyle suddenly announced, putting his clothes back on, apparently unconsciously.<br />
<br />
Jen, caught off guard by the accidental &quot;transform or dare,&quot; glanced around the room.  The counter was now spotless, and the ashtray was gone.  In its place was a stack of books.  Books with titles like &quot;How to Succeed with Women:  getting all the sex you want!&quot;  &quot;The Psychology of Females:  making their minds and emotions work for you.&quot;  And other texts.  On manipulating women.  Not what she intended...<br />
<br />
And she had to answer the Transform or Dare pretty quick, or her minute would be up.</p>
