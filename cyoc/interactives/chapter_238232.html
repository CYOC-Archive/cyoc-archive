<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">### Chapter: A Different Kind of Favor<br />
<br />
Two months had passed, and life for Kenith and Sam had settled into a comfortable rhythm. Nothing too wild had happened lately, although Kenith had been busy tweaking his body and mind with the *Chronicle* app. Now seven years old, Kenith looked... well, a little freaky, if Sam was honest. Despite his young age, Kenith had the kind of muscles you’d see on a fitness model—abs, biceps, and all. But he still managed to balance it out, keeping a certain boyish cuteness that prevented him from looking too out of place. It was their birthday two weeks ago, Sam now officially a teenager, and Kenith—well, Kenith had turned himself into something out of a comic book superhero.<br />
<br />
Sam had been dealing with the usual trials of turning 13—school, friends, and the awkward transition into teenage life. But today was different. As Kenith lay on his bed, absentmindedly fiddling with his still-longish blonde hair and listening to his favorite music, Sam burst into the room.<br />
<br />
Kenith sat up, surprised. &quot;What’s up?&quot; he asked, seeing Sam’s new haircut—short, with a little fringe brushing down to his eyes. It was a drastic change from his usual look, and Sam seemed a bit nervous as he rubbed the back of his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh... I need to call in my favor,&quot; Sam said, his voice hesitant.<br />
<br />
Kenith immediately perked up, excited at the prospect of doing something interesting. &quot;Okay!&quot; he said, smiling. He was bored anyway, and this sounded like just the thing to make his day more exciting. But Sam was acting weird, more nervous than usual. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, looking like he was about to ask for something huge.<br />
<br />
“I, uh...” Sam stammered, rubbing his forehead. “I kind of need you to... turn into a girl. To pretend to be my girlfriend.”<br />
<br />
Kenith blinked, not entirely sure he heard that right. “Wait... what?”<br />
<br />
Sam sighed, clearly embarrassed. “I told all my friends I had this... really hot girlfriend. I don’t, obviously. But there’s a pool party today, and they said I could bring her to prove she exists. So, I need you to be her. Just for today.”<br />
<br />
Kenith stared at him, not really knowing how to respond. *Turn into a girl?* He hadn’t done that before, and the idea was... well, interesting. Different. But Sam was clearly in a bind, and Kenith knew his brother wouldn’t ask if he didn’t really need the help. Plus, it could be fun. Something new.<br />
<br />
Kenith shrugged. “Sure, why not?” he said, smiling. “It’ll be something different.”<br />
<br />
Sam let out a deep breath, relief flooding his face. “Oh man, thanks. I was worried you’d say no.”<br />
<br />
Kenith stood up, stretching out as he walked over to his phone, ready to make the transformation. “So, what kind of girl are we talking here?” Kenith asked, curious. “Any ideas?”<br />
<br />
Sam scratched the back of his head, looking a little sheepish. “Remember that 15-year-old girl from one of Dad’s games? The one with the... you know, the *amazing* body? Long black hair? She was really pretty. I was thinking something like her.”<br />
<br />
Kenith raised an eyebrow, rolling his eyes at Sam’s obvious teenage crush. “Oh, I remember,” he said, smirking. That girl had definitely caught both of their attention that day, and apparently, Sam hadn’t forgotten.<br />
<br />
“Oh, and you’ll need to wear a bikini,” Sam added quickly, before blushing. “You know, for the pool party.”<br />
<br />
Kenith chuckled, already typing away on the app. “Fine. But you owe me big time for this.”<br />
<br />
The familiar blue glow of the app washed over Kenith as he pressed “Confirm.” In seconds, he felt his body shift—his muscles slimming down, his frame becoming more delicate. His long blonde hair darkened, growing even longer until it cascaded down his back, brushing against his lower back. His chest expanded, filling out the pink two-piece bikini that he had chosen, and his legs became smooth and slender. Everything about him was different, softer, and undeniably feminine.<br />
<br />
It felt strange—but not unpleasant. Kenith looked down at his new body, running his hands over the smooth curves. Being a girl was... oddly different, but also kind of interesting. He shifted his weight, noticing how his movements felt more graceful, how his long hair swayed with every step.<br />
<br />
Sam stood there, staring. “Whoa...”<br />
<br />
Kenith—now a 15-year-old girl—smiled, flipping her long black hair over her shoulder. “I guess I look the part, huh?”<br />
<br />
Sam nodded dumbly, clearly impressed and maybe a little overwhelmed. “Yeah... you look... perfect. Like, seriously. Thanks, Kenith—er, I mean... whatever your name is now.”<br />
<br />
Kenith shrugged. “You can still call me Kenith, I guess. It’s just for today.” She gave him a playful smirk. “Now, come on, ‘boyfriend,’ let’s go to this party.”<br />
<br />
Sam, still blushing, grabbed his swim trunks and towel, trying to play it cool. “Alright, alright. Let’s do this.”<br />
<br />
As they left the house, heading to the pool party, Kenith couldn’t help but feel a strange sense of excitement. Sure, it was weird being in a girl’s body, but it was also fun. And seeing Sam so flustered and nervous was worth the whole thing. This would definitely be an interesting day.<br />
<br />
And with that, the two brothers—now posing as boyfriend and girlfriend—walked out into the summer sun, ready for whatever came next.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
The pool party was in full swing, and Emily—the name Kenith had chosen for the day—was having a blast. She had been nervous at first, unsure how to act, but she quickly adapted. On the way to the party, she had made a few mental tweaks with the app, just subtle changes to help her feel comfortable in her new body, to act naturally as a girl, and most importantly, to play the role of Sam’s girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, she found herself enjoying it. Being Emily was fun, exciting even. She liked the way her body moved, the way her long hair swayed, and how she felt in her skin. The attention she got at the party was different, too. Everyone seemed more aware of her presence, but in a way that made her feel special, not awkward.<br />
<br />
Sam, for his part, was getting more comfortable with the idea too. At first, he had been a little stiff, awkwardly holding her hand and trying to play the role of a cool boyfriend. But soon enough, he relaxed, especially when they started splashing around in the pool, laughing and playing with his friends. Emily, as Kenith had designed her, was a perfect mix of fun and flirtatious. She could feel Sam’s hand resting on her waist as they swam, and when he playfully grabbed her by the waist or brushed against her in the water, it didn’t feel weird. It felt... nice.<br />
<br />
Everything was going smoothly, but then, out of nowhere, Sam did something unexpected.<br />
<br />
As they were standing by the edge of the pool, laughing at one of his friend’s jokes, Sam leaned in and kissed her. It wasn’t a quick, friendly peck, but a real kiss. For a second, Emily froze, her mind racing. But then, against all odds, she kissed him back. It felt perfect in the moment—like they were just two teenagers in the middle of a fun summer day, totally caught up in each other.<br />
<br />
But reality hit her like a tidal wave, and Emily pulled away suddenly, her heart pounding in her chest. She didn’t know why, but the kiss had left her feeling confused. Her mind was still Kenith’s, but her body had responded differently. She couldn’t shake the strangeness of it, the lines that were starting to blur.<br />
<br />
Without thinking, she bolted, running towards the bathrooms, leaving Sam standing there, wide-eyed and muttering, “Oh, shit.” He quickly followed after her.<br />
<br />
“Emily, wait!” Sam called, catching up to her just outside the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
She spun around, her hands trembling slightly. “What the hell was that, Sam? You kissed me!”<br />
<br />
Sam stood there, looking sheepish but also... kind of proud. He shrugged. “Yeah, I kissed you. You’re my amazing girlfriend for the day, remember? And you kissed me back.”<br />
<br />
Emily couldn’t deny it. She had kissed him back. Worse, she hated how much she had enjoyed it. Before she could argue further, Sam took a step closer, his eyes softening. “It’s just for today,” he whispered, leaning in and kissing her again.<br />
<br />
This time, Emily didn’t pull away. She let herself get swept up in the moment, feeling Sam’s hands gently resting on her waist, then sliding up her back. And before she knew it, they were both completely caught up in each other, hands exploring the unfamiliar territory of their bodies in a way that felt both thrilling and dangerous. Sam, being careful not to cross any lines, pulled away after a few moments, his breath ragged.<br />
<br />
“I... I think that’s enough for today,” Sam said, his voice filled with a mix of excitement and confusion. “Let’s leave it here. We’ll just... forget any of this happened when we get home.”<br />
<br />
Emily nodded, still catching her breath, her heart pounding as she realized how far they had gone. “Yeah,” she said softly. “Forget all of it.”<br />
<br />
As they walked back to the party, Sam leaned in and gave Emily one last peck on the cheek, the kind of casual, sweet gesture that would’ve been normal between a couple. But they both knew—beneath it all—this was something far more complicated. Sam clearly enjoyed having Emily as his girlfriend, but it was still Kenith inside. It was a strange situation, one they both knew wouldn’t last beyond today.<br />
<br />
When they got home, Sam, as promised, convinced Emily to turn back into Kenith. She used the app, transforming back into her familiar seven-year-old boy form, the long black hair disappearing, the lithe, feminine body shrinking back into the more muscular, childlike frame of Kenith.<br />
<br />
As soon as the transformation was complete, Kenith blinked up at Sam, a little confused. “So... what happened today?”<br />
<br />
Sam smiled, patting his little brother’s head. “You were the best girlfriend ever, that’s what happened. Thanks for being Emily.”<br />
<br />
Kenith shrugged, still unsure what to make of the whole thing. “Well, glad it worked out,” he said, already letting the details of the day slip from his mind.<br />
<br />
For Sam, it was easier to see Emily and Kenith as two completely different people. Emily had felt so real in those moments at the party, like someone else entirely. It made everything easier to digest, and he couldn’t help but feel grateful for the day, despite the strangeness of it all.<br />
<br />
The brothers settled down for the evening, just like they always did. Kenith, happy and carefree again, rested his head on Sam’s lap as they watched a movie together. Sam absentmindedly played with Kenith’s hair, stroking the soft strands like he always did when they were relaxed.<br />
<br />
For now, they were just brothers again. And everything felt like it had returned to normal.<br />
<br />
At least, as normal as things could be when reality was as flexible as an app on a phone.<br />
<br />
But for now, that was enough.</p>
