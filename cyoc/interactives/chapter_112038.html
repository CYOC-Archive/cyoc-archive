<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben and Alex both in their werewolf fursonas were asleep in Ben’s room. Sleeping contently; their muzzles resting on each other’s shoulders as they sleep embracing each other, their furry chests pressed up on each other. Their usual nightly runs ending in both coupling and expressing their love for one another; the male werewolves retire for the evening with a belly full of rabbit and mice. Each unaware that a tiny predator is stalking their twitching ears.<br />
<br />
A grey furred kitten with blue eyes was staring at Ben’s wolfish ears; unafraid of the low growls as the sixteen year old teen softly snores. The young kitten slowly raises her paw, testing the air to see if a reaction occurs. Not finding any; she bats the ear getting it to twitch. Swatting the furry appendage again; this time the kitten gets a grunt from the sleepy werewolf. A third swat wakes the sleepy were up.<br />
<br />
Ben looking for what disturbed his peaceful slumber; he sees the offending creature that dared to wake him.<br />
“Jasmine,” Ben yawns; “how did you get in here?”<br />
Not getting an answer other than a small meow and a loud purr as the tiny kitten approaches; nuzzling Ben as she shows her affection.<br />
“Well since you’re here,” Ben picking up the kitten with his paw and placing her in between him and Alex; “perhaps you’ll enjoy having a nap with us.”<br />
<br />
Jasmine refusing to stay still; pushes her tiny muzzle next to Ben’s; purring and nuzzling the werewolf, her tiny paws digging into Alex as she tries to get Ben to feed her.<br />
“Are you hungry,” Ben looking at the determined kitten; “you want your breakfast? Then help me wake Alex here.”<br />
Ben taking Jasmine and placing her on Alex; he watches the cat walk along the werewolf just to get to him. Laughing as the kitten continues to purr and swat his ears. It wasn’t long before Alex Ramsey wakes up to the sound of purring and a laughing werewolf.<br />
“Morning sleepy head,” Ben seeing Alex’s lupine eyes staring back at him; “guess who decided to visit us.”<br />
“one of your moms kittens,” Alex staring at the tiny critter showing no fear at the large predators she is tormenting; “I thought they slept with Frances and Samantha. Since they are both were-cats themselves.”<br />
“You know how curious cats can be,” Ben taking Jasmine and gently taking her off his bed; “she must of thought we were a more loving couple to snuggle up with.”<br />
“Well she woke us up,” Alex getting up; “might as well stay up. Nate has that sod job for today.”<br />
“I can’t believe you are working or him,” Ben shaking his lupine head; “hell I can’t believe he managed to start up his own business while still in school.”<br />
“I can’t believe he and Jean are still and item,” Alex now up and stretching his tail swishing, tickling Ben’s muzzle as he puts on the pendant Ben got for him last Christmas. A simple stainless steel medallion of two wolves howling to the moon with a message of his and Ben’s love on the reverse. Alex seeing the copper medallion with a wolf embossed on it he got for Ben secured prominently on his cell phone lanyard as Ben puts it on him; this make Alex happy. While not as extravagant as the pendent he is wearing; it was no less a thoughtful gift.<br />
<br />
Ben walking down the stairs to the kitchen with Alex close behind; he is surprised to see his mothers also awake. Samantha wearing a purple colored microfiber bathrobe Frances got for her last Christmas. Enjoying the feel of the fabric on her fur; it makes the were-cat feel like royalty. As the mayor pro-tem; Samantha felt like she was on top of the world, yet still found the job far more grueling and thankless than being the town chancellor. With a few months to go for elections; Samantha still had yet to decide if she was going to run for mayor for real.<br />
“Guess who I found tormenting me and Alex this morning,” Ben placing Jasmine in front of Samantha; “I think she is hungry.”<br />
Ah,” Frances giggles; “I told you Jasmine wouldn’t have gone too far. And you thought she slipped outside.”<br />
 “That is a genuine concern,” Samantha cuddling the tiny kitten as she gets up to feed her; “what with all the weres running and rutting through the woods during the summer and the wild animals; there is a good chance that this little bundle of love could be an easy meal.”<br />
“Alex and I wouldn’t do that,” Ben shaking his head as he grabs the coffee pot and pours him and Alex a cup. Developing a taste for the bitter brew as he sips it without cream or sugar; “nor would any other were make a meal out of the kitten, not with the collar on her.”<br />
“There are still the wild animals,” Samantha looking at Ben; “despite all the weres running about in the woods at night, they can still view Jasmine and Saffron here as prey. I don’t want them outside.”<br />
“Well Jasmine wasn’t outside,” Ben sipping his coffee; “she was with me and Alex this morning.”<br />
“Possibly with you the entire night,” Frances speaking up; “this fearless little kitten must love snuggling with you.” Frances giving the hungry cat a scratch behind the ear as she eats her canned cat food.<br />
“I like snuggling with Alex more,” Ben chuckling.<br />
“And I with you,” Alex answering; “but I have to go soon, Landscaping job with Nate today.”<br />
“Have fun,” Frances smiling; “you want some breakfast before you go?”<br />
“A couple slices of toast couldn’t hurt,” Alex finishing up his coffee; “but I should get ready first.”<br />
“Just be quick with the shower,” Ben chuckling; “my moms still need to get ready for work.”<br />
<br />
“Speaking of work,” Samantha staring at Ben as he works the toaster; “how is your job hunting going?”<br />
“I have a job interview this afternoon,” Ben answering.<br />
“Oh,” Frances perking up; “where?”<br />
“Grrrrrrr,” Ben answering; “as a bus boy.”<br />
“That restaurant,” Samantha looking stunned; “good luck then. Be sure to wear you good clothes then. First impressions are important.”<br />
“Chances are,” Frances chuckling; “Ben’s job interview will be in his fursona. I doubt his clothing will make a difference.”<br />
“Mom is not wrong there,” Ben responding; “everyone knows that you don’t get in to dine unless you are a were.”<br />
<br />
Ben was referring to the restaurant in town know as Grrrrrrr. A restaurant that caters to weres. In order to dine you have to be in your fursona. Featuring set meals that change daily; no menus, the restaurant is famous for its specially tailored deserts. More so with the feline based weres. A restaurant that does not serve liquor or allow weres to rut in the establishment; it has become a popular albeit expensive place for weres to congregate and be unafraid to embrace their fursona in a public establishment.<br />
“Be that as it may,” Samantha looking at her adoptive werewolf son; “put your good clothes on for the interview.”<br />
“Fine,” Ben sighing as he takes the toast he made and heads upstairs to get ready and see Alex off.<br />
“I better get ready as well,” Frances putting her coffee down; “I have a full day with patients today. In fact I better call Rudy to see how full my day is,” Frances getting up and kissing Samantha; “I’ll see you later today. Good luck Mayor Twist.”<br />
<br />
Samantha sighed as Frances called her mayor.<br />
“I need to make that decision on whether to run soon,” Samantha speaking to herself; looking at her kittens Jasmine and Saffron; “you two are staying here at home.”</p>
