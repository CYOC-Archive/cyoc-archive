<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The shopping trip was a bit longer than expected, though some it made sense as it actually required visiting a couple of different stores in town, particularly when it came to things like shoes and so on. Some of the more &quot;work&quot; and &quot;interview&quot; type of thing were a bit on the higher side for both you and Luna, but then being a MILF-wolf wouldn&#39;t mean not having a summer job. Luna being pregnant might even make that even more important, but some of those things would have to wait for the day, as the big thing now was to make sure that you and Luna were appropriately registered. <br />
<br />
That process was something that had to be done for MILF-wolves because of the unique status that the MILF-wolf strain of the were-virus that was different from others. For normal werewolves, registration was optional, not mandatory, as a new werewolf wouldn&#39;t change gender, age, or have a massive increase in libido and for the most part a fair amount of people had accepted normal werewolves over the years. When Kellie got accidentally bit by a sick werewolf and became the first MILF-wolf and the differences in that strain became apparent, including changing gender, aging up or aging down, lactating, and then having a massive increase in libido, that was when registration became mandatory, likely to make sure that a new MILF-wolf wouldn&#39;t lead to a town of MILF-wolves, which would then in theory last only one generation. <br />
<br />
You&#39;d seen bits and pieces on that, and you accepted it. Which had been why getting your ID cards, and other identification papers from your house the previous night had been so important, though admittedly some of that urgency was also because you&#39;d been afraid that your conservative father wouldn&#39;t react well to you going from an 18 year old male to a physically 30 year female. His response was ultimately far better than you expected and you had everything you needed in a folder held under your arm as you and Luna followed Kellie and Roxie into city hall where all that sort of thing was handled. It was a bit odd in some ways, as while you were transgender, you&#39;d never actually worn women&#39;s clothing before. The clothes that Kellie and Roxie loaned you for the day weren&#39;t that bad, though admittedly they didn&#39;t fit perfectly, show that while you were now built similarly to them, the comparison wasn&#39;t exact Thankfully the clothes and shoes that you and Luna picked out for yourselves were in line with your measurements.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, for all your help,&quot; you said to Kellie and Roxie as Kellie opened the door for you and Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Roxie answered, &quot;you&#39;ve been a good friend to Luna over the years and if she loves you the way I love Kellie... you&#39;re worth helping. Just to see our baby girl smile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a baby anymore,&quot; Luna pointed out as she opened one of the inner doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Physically, yes,&quot; Kellie smiled as you stood by Luna as Kellie and Roxie then passed you both by, &quot;but you will always be mine and Roxie&#39;s baby girl. Just as your and Nicki&#39;s daughter will be YOUR baby girl. One of the things that comes along with being a parent.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Luna nodded as you then followed Kellie and Roxie into the lobby area of city hall. It was fairly enclosed space, mostly coming from the fact that the building as a whole was relatively old and had been built in the late 1800s or early 1900s out of stone.  On the outside it looked impressive with what looked like a bell tower at its center, but on the inside it actually felt a bit cramped. There were wooden doors at various areas of the lobby that lead to different areas of the building along with a couple sets of opened &quot;windows&quot; into other areas  that looked more like office spaces. Kellie and Roxie walked to on that was diagonally across the room from the door to the lobby and you and Luna followed, moving around a set of four chairs in the middle of the lobby, which was underneath the tower area in the building and a spot where natural light really came into the lobby area. Another middle aged woman greeted Kellie and Roxie as they approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Mrs. Vaxer, it&#39;s good to see you, don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t miss my appointment next week,&quot; the woman gave a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good because the shop tends to get busy,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;particularly on the days after full moon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... giving you time off for that is nice, though I suppose it then becomes hectic when you come back,&quot; the woman chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;m a good stylist and I like what I do,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;so I can&#39;t complain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you&#39;re here to update Luna&#39;s registration?&quot; the woman asked to Kellie and Roxie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Luna had her big night last night, as you can see,&quot; Roxie commented, &quot;and she looks good as a beautiful and confident MILF-wolf can be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And she&#39;s made a friend,&quot; the woman answered, &quot;is this another pack member or a new member?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;New,&quot; you spoke up meekly and offered your hand, which to your surprise the woman shook it like she was an old friend, &quot;I&#39;m Nicole Maxwell... well, I&#39;m Nicole NOW. I was Nicolas Maxwell until yesterday evening... when Luna gave me a most wonderful gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then presented your folder and opened it to reveal the various things you&#39;d likely need to register as a new MILF-wolf. The woman looked at it and then looked at you and then looked over at Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted to be a MILF-wolf, dear?&quot; the woman said with some concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... you see, I was a transgendered male... I felt I should be female and was born in the wrong gender,&quot; you explained, &quot;when I learned that becoming a MILF-wolf would MAKE me female... it was the only thing I wanted to be. I had a bit of a secret crush on Luna and figured she or her family could help me get in contact with a MILF-wolf to change me... and found that Luna was born a MILF-wolf... and I couldn&#39;t say &quot;no&quot; to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re mates now,&quot; Luna smiled as she held your arm with one hand and one hand absentmindedly rubbing her stomach with the other, &quot;and with a little one of our own on her way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The information I can would show that you&#39;re eighteen, Nicole, but I have to ask... does your father know and did he approve of this?&quot; the woman asked you.<br />
<br />
&quot;We told him after I changed,&quot; you answered, &quot;he was surprisingly supportive... in ways I didn&#39;t expect he would.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you didn&#39;t force yourself on him, Luna?&quot; the woman asked to Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I force myself on the one person I&#39;ve probably ever loved?&quot; Luna replied, &quot;Nick&#39;s arrival at our home was a surprise... but a part me... deep down... was happy to see him see me become what I am now as I reached the age of transformation. I couldn&#39;t hide from him that I loved him and would be happy to turn him into her if she wished... and be her mate, if she would be mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman looked to both you and Luna and noted that both of you seemed close to each other and that Luna&#39;s answer was focused on each other.  It was an alert to being good and honorable, which the woman guessed was some sort of reminder toward there being actual romance between the something beyond more than just being bullied into anything.. The woman then turned to pull a  set of papers from a set of papers and then moved to hand them to you. you noted that they were fairly simple and carried a set of things that looked similar to what you&#39;d remember filling out when you and your father had finished out the paperwork for your own drivers license.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Nicole,&quot; the woman spoke as she presented the papers for you, &quot;You&#39;ll need to fill these out. One will essentially copy your normal human identification and your age. Since you are eighteen, parental information is not needed, though you can include it if you wish to. You will also need Luna&#39;s signature at the end of your registration to identify that she was your MILF-wolf sponsor and that your transformation was of your own free will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was,&quot; you vowed as you took the paperwork,&quot; you answered, &quot;will you need my paperwork... like my birth certificate and so on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We may take copies of it, but the originals will be yours to keep,&quot; the woman answered, &quot;all we will do is add the MILF-Wolf stamp that will then forward any and all files to what you fill out here today as part of your registration.  We will then copy what you fill out and what Luna signs. You are then to save the original with your birth certificate and anything else. They would serve the same purpose. We&#39;d then fill out the new ID card that is also based on that information as a MILF-wolf and we&#39;ll escort you to where your picture may be taken for the card. You can use the ID card for voting and for anything else. Do you have a car?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I have a driver&#39;s license,&quot; you answered, &quot;I learned to drive and dad taught me... but after earning the license the bank had to cut down on my dad&#39;s wages a little bit and the summer work I&#39;d had in the past wouldn&#39;t cover a car.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you&#39;ll need to come back in a week when the guys from the state are here to do all the driver&#39;s licenses and bring your new MILF-wolf ID,&quot; the woman spoke, &quot;they&#39;ll then update your card with your new form.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then took the paper and noted all the things that were there, including things about you, which made you glad that you and Luna had gotten help from Kellie and Roxie regarding your measurements. You took them and moved to set about filling out the forms in one of the seats in the center of the room. The woman you&#39;d been talking to then pulled out another set of papers to Luna.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Luna, dear, since all we need from you is to update your status from developing to active, this is all we&#39;ll need from you,&quot; the woman spoke, &quot;fill out on the lines that relate to the trigger for your transformation and so on. We can then handle your photos quickly and so on. Your driver&#39;s license won&#39;t need to be changed until it&#39;s normal renewal date, given that you&#39;re still female.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna nodded and then came to sat down next to you. The two of you were soon filling things out, and they were straight forward. Yours included all sorts of identifying information that ranged what your name would change to as a female, what your new height and weight were, among other things. You also had to include your birth date and social security number and so on. It was straightforward and you went about filling it out using the pen provided and turning to your existing IDs when needed. While you worked on this, Kellie approached that window and looked to the woman again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re girl turns eighteen, has her transformation and turns you into a grandmother to be,&quot; the woman said to Kellie, which you could listen in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;though this was AFTER her eighteenth birthday. And I think Luna and Nick were pretty close for years. So... what am I to do here? Tell an eighteen year old transgender male that he can&#39;t become a MILF-wolf if he wants to? And then pretty much start a war with my daughter over the person she loves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose not,&quot; the woman answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Ethyl,&quot; Kellie gave a small smile, finally saying the woman&#39;s name, &quot;in the meantime... I might have a bit of a question for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t in relation to my appointment, is it?&quot; the woman, Ethyl, asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... more a warning that Nicki got last night,&quot; Kellie spoke, &quot;something about the Wolf Hunters. I was wondering if you might be able to confirm that for me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what the police are paying attention to,&quot; Ethyl answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;True... but you do register any and all new MILF-wolves or normal werewolves that decide to register,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;so... if some group like the Wolf Hunters were to come here or want to... you&#39;d be warned of it. If only to make sure that you and your staff are safe and that the local pack can also remain safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked up to see that Ethyl didn&#39;t immediately answer, but noted Kellie and Roxie looking to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;This doesn&#39;t go beyond some basic warnings and staying safe,&quot; Ethyl warned, &quot;but yes... the Feds have been monitoring our state&#39;s chapter of the Wolf Hunters and according to some stuff online... they look like they&#39;re on the way here. What they&#39;re explicitly here fore, they don&#39;t know. This could be some protest or it could be something far more violent and it would be best to not get too confrontational with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have no desire to go fighting, Ethyl, I assure you of that,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;should there be anything we alert the Neighborhood Watch to look out for, if they do come here and try to be violent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At the moment I can&#39;t say,&quot; Ethyl answered, &quot;all the warnings we and the police have gotten is that the state&#39;s chapter is chattering about coming here. What, when, and why aren&#39;t full known... yet. The best I can say is just to be alert and in contact with the police and 911.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave a sigh at that and then returned to the paperwork you had to fill out. That related to what your stepmother had warned you about, and it sounded like whatever she had overheard was correct. That a group of people known for their hatred of werewolves in general were intending to come here for purposes unknown. It was something you knew worried Luna the previous night, particularly while Kellie and Roxie were out, and to a degree it worried you too. You didn&#39;t want to be killed and you you didn&#39;t want Luna or the baby she was carrying to even get a scratch. Instinctively, you wanted to protect her... but for the moment there wasn&#39;t anything you could do about that beyond hope that they were either more peaceful or that the police had enough intelligence on what they had planned to stop them. You focused on filling out your paperwork.<br />
<br />
And that paperwork was easy to get through. A bit time consuming, perhaps, but easy. Luna finished hers quickly and was soon taken back to get her updated ID card while Roxie stood guard over Luna&#39;s older ID and papers. By the time Luna came back out, you were just finishing the paperwork you had to fill out and motioned over for Luna to come over. Luna smiled, nodded and then finished out form with the signatures that confirmed that your transformation was not forced on you. From there you then returned to the counter with your papers and the papers you had to fill out. You watched as several of those cards where hit with a small inked stamp that put on a mark that looked like a stylized wolf&#39;s head. Ethyl looked over the papers you filled out and then had them copied. You got the originals back and the city kept the copies. You where then directed to a nearby door and then lead to a small room that was well lit by electric lights but had a black curtain over the windows on the south end of the room. They then took your picture, just as they&#39;d done for your driver&#39;s license and you were left to wait a few moments. It wasn&#39;t long before a laminated card was placed in your hands with your face and shoulders visible in the picture with MILF-wolf Identification written across the top.<br />
<br />
With that work done... you then made your way out. As you passed the counter, Ethyl motioned to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy your day,&quot; Ethyl said to you, &quot;and don&#39;t worry... Rosewood&#39;s done its best to keep ruffians like the Wolf Hunters calm. You just focus on being good to Luna. And we&#39;ll see you in a week for the new drivers&#39; license. Will you need an alert?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... though it&#39;d be best to call the Vaxers,&quot; you said to her, &quot;I want to stay close to Luna... I love her very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethyl nodded and you were free to head out, placing the folder in which your papers were now all in under your arm and sliding the ID card into the back pocket of the pants you were wearing. You were a bit careful, as the jeans were Roxie&#39;s and you felt that your posterior was a hair bigger than Roxie&#39;s and you didn&#39;t want to damage her pants. From there you then looked up others who were waiting for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... it&#39;s twelve fifteen now... shall we do lunch?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Roxie commented, taking Kellie&#39;s arm, &quot;we shall.&quot;</p>
