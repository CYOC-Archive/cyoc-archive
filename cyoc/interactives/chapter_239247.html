<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aidan had only just gotten home when Mark enters the apartment. Aidan realizes he forgot to lock the door. That was a mistake.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how was it?&quot; Mark takes a seat on Aidan&#39;s favorite chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was disgusting, Mark, I was so thirsty I had to drink boy pee!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan is furious, which is exactly what Mark wants. Mark gets hard looking at know-it-all Aidan bitching about drinking piss. Aidan always acted like he was smarter than Mark. Well, Aidan wasn&#39;t going to think his way out of this one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was the fact that they were boys really bothering you that badly?&quot; asks Mark. &quot;Tell me why.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan is forced to respond. &quot;I was humiliated. I&#39;m bigger, stronger, taller, and smarter than them, I even have a bigger dick! It makes me feel like dirt getting used for their amusement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...I see. You have a bigger dick.&quot; Mark strokes his chin thoughtfully. &quot;I noticed earlier that you shrank yourself, I assume by accident. Well, now you permanently have a 2 inch penis, and balls to match. And you don&#39;t have any body hair, or facial hair. Get naked so I can get a look at it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark, you asshole!&quot; Aidan is already yanking his shirt off, and his pants and underwear soon follow, making a pile on the living room floor. Aidan covers his dick with his hands, and he can feel how small it is, and how smooth now that it has no hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;ll never try to hide your dick from me,&quot; Mark says, and grins as Aidan&#39;s hands drop to his sides. Mark leans in to take a closer look. &quot;Man, this thing is tiny. Get hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan&#39;s embarrassment grows as he sees his dick harden up. It&#39;s as Mark said, 2 inches long, shorter than a chapstick tube but about the same thickness.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be super embarrassed right now,&quot; Mark says wickedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate you,&quot; Aidan says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make a deal with you,&quot; says Mark. &quot;When you&#39;re willing to get down on your knees in front of me and beg to be my slave for life, I&#39;ll undo one change on you, of your choosing. So if you do it right now, that&#39;ll only leave you with one curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan considers the offer. &quot;So I&#39;ll be stuck drinking piss or having a tiny cock for the rest of my life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, but you won&#39;t have both, so what do you say?&quot; Mark is loving this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I say fuck you, I&#39;ll get out of this on my own, and you&#39;ll be sorry you ever tried to fuck with me!&quot; Aidan then spits in Marks face.<br />
<br />
Mark looks annoyed, and he wipes it off, but then his smile comes back. &quot;All right, my offer stands. You&#39;ll regret rejecting it, I promise you that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan hears the confidence in Mark&#39;s voice. Is it too late to apologize?<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark, um, look,&quot; Aidan begins.<br />
<br />
Mark cuts him off. &quot;I&#39;m going to modify your piss drinking curse. Now whenever you drink someone&#39;s piss, you have to get naked first, or you won&#39;t be able to swallow it. You can tell them it&#39;s so your clothes don&#39;t get stinky, and they&#39;ll believe you. Doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t make fun of your tiny dick though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan feels like he&#39;s been punched in the gut. Mark really knows how to tighten the screws. He thought he&#39;d be able to hide his new toddler dick but this would make it impossible.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you&#39;re getting pretty thirsty already,&quot; Mark adds. &quot;I was able to watch that whole thing, I doubt those boys gave you much fluid. It&#39;s getting pretty late so the mall will be shut down. You might want to consider where your next drink is coming from.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark leaves Aidan alone. Aidan feels his tiny cock. It&#39;s still hard. Feeling more disgusted with himself, he sits down on the couch, and masturbates. He needs to stroke it carefully with his fingers, having almost no room to work with. It&#39;s not easy getting off with a dick that small.<br />
<br />
When he orgasms, it feels all right, but it&#39;s a dry cum, and he&#39;s left feeling unsatisfied by the experience. He remembers suddenly that Mark probably saw that. Great, so now he&#39;s being perved on even when Mark isn&#39;t in the room. &quot;I bet you liked that, sicko!&quot; Aidan shouts to the empty room. He goes and gets dressed.<br />
<br />
When his roommate Dan comes home, Aidan is already thirsty as hell. This isn&#39;t going to be pleasant, but it has to be done. Dan would believe him, one part of Mark&#39;s curse that is actually beneficial. Aidan steels his nerves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan, I need your help with something,&quot; says Aidan.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; asks Dan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...um, I have a medical condition,&quot; Aidan begins, then repeats his whole made up excuse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, does that mean you want me to...piss in your mouth?&quot; Dan asks, incredulous. &quot;Damn dude, that&#39;s disgusting!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan&#39;s face gets even redder. &quot;Dan, I know that, it tastes awful, but I was just diagnosed with it. I tried not to tell you, even got some strangers to do it, but I can&#39;t leave the apartment every time I get thirsty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess you&#39;re right,&quot; says Dan. &quot;But I don&#39;t want you seeing my dick, dude. I&#39;m not gay like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Dan, but believe me, you won&#39;t feel half as embarrassed as I will.&quot; Aidan has to hold back tears, as the crushing weight of his future humiliation sinks in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn...Well, are you thirsty right now?&quot; Dan asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very,&quot; Aidan says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Christ...all right, let&#39;s get this over with.&quot; Dan walks to the bathroom, and Aidan follows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, there&#39;s one more thing Dan, I kind of have to get naked first, so that nothing gets on my clothes.&quot; Aidan wished the ground would open up and swallow him as he saw Dan&#39;s expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to see that,&quot; Dan says. &quot;But it makes sense, so I guess, go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan nods, and begins to undress again. Stupid Mark and his twisted curses.<br />
<br />
When Aidan stands up and steps out of his underwear, Dan bursts out laughing. &quot;Dude, why don&#39;t you have any hair? And what&#39;s up with that dick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan&#39;s face gets red. He makes up an excuse. &quot;It&#39;s part of that gene defect I was telling you about. That&#39;s actually what made me go to the doctor&#39;s in the first place. My hair all fell out, and there was, well, another side effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiny side-effect,&quot; Dan says, straight-faced. Aidan glares at him.<br />
<br />
Aidan drops to his knees on the bathroom floor, and he&#39;s starting to hate that bathrooms have hard floors. Dan&#39;s amusement is gone from his face as he starts to unzip. <br />
<br />
When Dan pulls his dick out, it&#39;s soft, but Aidan is impressed by its size anyway. Aidan vowed that once he got his hands on Chronivac again, he&#39;d give himself a big dick first thing. Well, after turning Mark into a ferret.<br />
<br />
 &quot;It&#39;s better if I wrap my lips around it,&quot; says Aidan. &quot;Sorry.&quot; Dan looks away, obviously eager to be done with this, and Aidan leans in to swallow Dan&#39;s dick.<br />
<br />
Aidan has to wait a long time. He wishes Dan would hurry up. He glances upward, and sees Dan looking down at him, and Aidan looks away quickly.<br />
<br />
Finally, Dan starts pissing, and Aidan swallows it all down. Why did it have to be so warm? Bad enough it had that salty bitter taste, but warm, blech. He swallows it anyway, and only dribbles a little down his chin.<br />
<br />
When Dan&#39;s finished, he zips up and leaves without a second glance. Aidan gets dressed yet again, and cleans up.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
The next morning, Aidan&#39;s dehydration is out of control. He has an 8AM class, and he needs to be able to concentrate in it, so reluctantly, he knocks on Dan&#39;s door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan, hey, I&#39;m sorry for waking you up, but I kind of need a drink,&quot; says Aidan. He&#39;s only wearing his underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, dude...&quot; says Dan, voice muffled by his pillow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Dan, come on,&quot; says Aidan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but I&#39;m not getting out of bed for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan weighs leaving and getting a drink after class, but he almost never sees Dan during the day because of their schedules (something Aidan used to like), and doesn&#39;t want to risk having a classmate see him drinking piss in a public bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, I&#39;m coming in,&quot; says Aidan. He enters the room, drops his underwear, and considers how to do this. Dan is face down. &quot;Dan, can you turn over?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan groans and does as Aidan requested. Aidan shrugs and decides to go for it, shoving his head under the covers. Dan is only wearing underwear, so Aidan pulls it down, while ignoring how he can smell Dan&#39;s unwashed body.<br />
<br />
He wraps his lips around Dan&#39;s cock. And waits some more. He&#39;s starting to wonder if Dan fell asleep again when acrid, disgusting morning piss fills his mouth. He wants to throw up, but desperately tries not to, afraid that it would anger Dan and make him stop helping Aidan. Aidan guzzles it like his life depends on it.<br />
<br />
Dan starts and stops a few times, but eventually, he says, &quot;All done, now get out.&quot;<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
When Aidan gets back from his first class of the day, Mark is waiting for him in the apartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, pissbreath,&quot; Mark says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, asswipe,&quot; says Aidan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aidan, can I just say how much I love it that you don&#39;t give up?&quot; Mark says, and his warm smile confirms it. &quot;You are the best subject I could ask for. Want me to top you up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, I&#39;m not drinking your piss, ever,&quot; says Aidan.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right. Have you reconsidered my offer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I won&#39;t beg to be your slave,&quot; Aidan says through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
Mark shrugs. &quot;In that case, I&#39;ve got a new one for you today.&quot;</p>
