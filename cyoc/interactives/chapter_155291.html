<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John drove Erin across town, to the university where she worked and had her research lab. The campus was eerie at this hour, with nobody up and about around the faculty and research halls, although they did see a security guard who recognized Erin and waved. Erin was able to swipe a key-card to get into the research facility building, and she led John through dark halls until at last they arrived at her lab.<br />
<br />
Two grad students, young men in their early twenties, were working on some kind of cell culture when Erin and John arrived. One of them looked up, surprised. &quot;Dr. Cooper! Wow, you got here fast—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;ve been waiting on that analysis for longer than you think,&quot; said Erin. &quot;Now I need you and Reese to clear out and give me the lab. I&#39;m going to need the space.&quot; The other student looked up from his work and was about to protest, but Erin held up a hand and stopped him. &quot;And no backtalk. You kids don&#39;t need to be here this late as it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both mumbled a half-hearted, &quot;Yes, Dr. Cooper,&quot; cleaned up their work-station, and headed for the door. As they left, the first research assistant asked, &quot;Who&#39;s this guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin folded her arms. &quot;My boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two grad students scurried out the door, John distinctly heard one of them say, &quot;lucky son of a bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
John couldn&#39;t disagree.<br />
<br />
Erin, meanwhile, put a lab coat on and went over to a computer terminal hooked up to a very impressive-looking mainframe. &quot;I&#39;ve had a complete genetic analysis running in the background on the whole university network, 24/7, for about eight months now,&quot; she explained. &quot;I had an alarm set up to text me the instant it was done, but network latency meant that I didn&#39;t get the text until we were already half-way here. I also gave standing orders to all my grad-students to call me if they ever saw the lights on this mainframe go all green. It means my algorithms finally all finished.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what have you been analyzing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well to explain that, first I have to ask, what do you know about demi-human genetics?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Basically nothing, except what I&#39;ve heard you mention,&quot; said John. He thought for a moment and then said, &quot;I do remember something funny you said when we first met. About how if a human and a demi-human have a kid, there&#39;s always an even fifty-fifty chance the kid is born one parent&#39;s species or the other?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin nodded. &quot;Mm-hm. That&#39;s also true if two different species of demi-human try to cross-breed. We always breed true and never hybridize. So if, say, a centaur and a mer-person had a kid, the kid would be born as either centaur or mer, not some kind of half-breed. I mean, there *are* fish-tailed centaurs out there—ichthyocentaurs, they&#39;re called—but they&#39;re a third, completely separate species of their own, so maybe that&#39;s a bad example. But if, like, a faun and an arachne, or an elf and an orc—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it,&quot; said John. &quot;No such thing as a half-this, half-that. Every demi-human always belongs to one parent&#39;s species or the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin nodded. &quot;Right. Like Murph in the pub—he likes to say that he&#39;s half-mer and his dad was half-fairy, but the plan fact is, he&#39;s human, and so was his dad. If he ever has kids with a human, there is absolutely a zero-percent chance that they&#39;ll inherit any merfolk or fairy traits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So . . . let me guess,&quot; said John, &quot;you&#39;re working on figuring out exactly how all that works? Because, I may not be a geneticist or anything close to that, but I do remember chromosomes and Mendel and Punnett squares, and I know that that is *not* how genes work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;d be right,&quot; said Erin, who by now had booted up the terminal and was peering over the results of the analysis. &quot;That&#39;s because demi-human traits aren&#39;t fully genetic. They&#39;re magic. Being a demi-human is sort of like inheriting a hereditary enchantment—or curse—from one of your parents. It does alter the DNA, but not drastically. Every demi-human in the world is still <i>Homo sapiens</i> on the genetic level. Maybe with a few extra, unique DNA markers thanks to population isolation and genetic drift. But we&#39;ve never been fully cut off. Merfolk have been interbreeding with humans for tens of thousands of years—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that keeps us the same species genetically, even if we&#39;re different on the outside because of some funky magic,&quot; concluded John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right again,&quot; said Erin. &quot;And to this day, nobody knows where the first demi-humans came from. Ancient super-civilization? God-like aliens? Insane wizard? We&#39;ll probably never know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your people haven&#39;t dug up any clues from Atlantis yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin smirked. &quot;Not yet, but I&#39;m sure there are more than a few intrepid mer-archaeologists working on that as we speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a pause, John said, &quot;I&#39;d like to see it for myself someday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin didn&#39;t look up from the computer. &quot;Atlantis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm-hm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll go then. Someday, when I can go back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Awkward silence fell over the both of them. Erin continued looking over the results, until at last, she flicked her tail against the floor in annoyance and swiveled her chair around to face John. &quot;Damn it! All that time, wasted, and there&#39;s nothing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t find what you were looking for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin shook her head. She looked about ready to cry. John rushed over to embrace her, and she leaned her head on his shoulder and sobbed. &quot;I guess I should explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take your time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin took a couple of minutes to compose herself. Then she looked John in the eye and said, &quot;The reason I&#39;m here—the reason I&#39;m doing this research—is because the mer-people are having a crisis down in the sea, one that we haven&#39;t been able to figure out with any of our own magic or technology. A birth crisis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Birth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There hasn&#39;t been a mer-baby born in nearly five years.&quot;<br />
<br />
John took a minute to let that sink in. &quot;That&#39;s . . . that&#39;s insane. That kind of a flatline in your people&#39;s birth rate could damage your population so bad, it would take more than a generation to recover.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin nodded. &quot;So you see, it&#39;s kind of an emergency that I get this right and figure out what&#39;s going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I can imagine,&quot; said John. He asked, &quot;Are you saying that merfolk just can&#39;t have kids anymore? Don&#39;t tell me that&#39;s been your &#39;birth control&#39; method all this time—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, nothing like that!&quot; said Erin. &quot;We can have kids! We just can&#39;t have mer-kids. Any children we have, they&#39;re born human, and they either have to be left on land and raised among humans, or the parents have to risk a transformation spell. Which is not likely end well. Not by a long shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They can die?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For a permanent shape-shift spell cast upon newborn infant, even by a trained guild-wizard, the risk of fatality is nearly 60%.&quot;<br />
<br />
John covered his mouth with both hands. &quot;Oh my God.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Needless to say, most parents aren&#39;t willing to take that chance. So until I—and all the other scientists sent to the surface-world to study and do research—can figure out what&#39;s going on here, and how to fix it, there are no more mer-children. It&#39;s a *lot* of pressure—and until this crisis is over, I *cannot* return to the sea and face my friends and family. I just can&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why you won&#39;t go into the ocean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin nodded, once again holding back tears.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes spent quietly embracing each other, with John trying to let all his love and support flow into Erin, he asked, &quot;So what was up with the analysis? What were you expecting to find, that you didn&#39;t?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s complicated,&quot; said Erin. &quot;Long story short, I was comparing merfolk DNA samples collected over the past ten years, looking for any sign that something had changed five years ago when this started. Some sign of degradation, or disease, or maybe the effects of a chemical or pollutant—but there&#39;s nothing. Which probably means that whatever&#39;s going on, it&#39;s entirely magical.&quot;<br />
<br />
John suddenly had a horrible thought. &quot;What if the spell or whatever it is that created the merfolk race in the first place is just—wearing off? Can that happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin looked horrified. &quot;I—I don&#39;t know! But . . . it&#39;s possible. Merfolk are some of the oldest demi-humans in the world. Most non-human races are thousands of years old, but we&#39;ve been around for tens of thousands. If an enchantment like that can just—end, suddenly and without warning, we&#39;d be the species that it would happen to first!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; said John. &quot;So what&#39;s the next step, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I haven&#39;t proven conclusively that the effect isn&#39;t genetic, but . . . it&#39;s not looking good for that theory. Which means we need to examine magical auras instead of DNA profiles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you need some kind of wizard—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A diviner who reads auras,&quot; said Erin, &quot;and lots of merfolk volunteers. Which, I guess, means that I&#39;m heading back to Atlantis after all.&quot;</p>
