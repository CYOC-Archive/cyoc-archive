<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Getting things organized for hunting Horace Washerman down was long and time consuming. Most of that was in the phone calls to both representatives of the Park Service and the FBI to get the proper warrants and to make sure everything was in order. And that took a few days to accomplish. While Officer Barnes and I waited for Officer Won to complete that work, we largely focused on running our patrols and keeping a basic lookout in case Washerman came out of the park and caused more trouble. So far, he hadn’t.<br />
<br />
Molly seemed to recover fairly well from the shock of learning that Washerman had attacked Michael York, though both of us were nervous about what would happen to him. And at present, Washerman’s activities had our full attention. Tabby’s campaign for the School District Superintendent’s spot continued, but even that seemed to be on the “back burner” compared to Washerman. And events a day or two later didn’t seem to change that.<br />
<br />
“We ought find a way to go down to Kalispell and visit him,” Molly commented as we began setting our dinner table one evening, “leave him some flowers or a get well card… or something.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know if we’d have the time to do that,” I said nervously, “we’ve been busy trying to catch Washerman.”<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t take long to go down there,” Molly countered, “Dave or Uncle Frank would be more then happy to drive us.”<br />
<br />
I was about to speak when there was a knock at our door. I turned my head to it curiously, as neither Molly nor I expected company that evening.<br />
<br />
“I got it,” I said after moment and moved toward the door.<br />
<br />
I was a little curious about who could be there. The last surprise guest that Molly and I had had was the Hindu family that had stopped by to announce their presence and offer their services as providers of silks for Molly and I. With all that was going on though, I didn’t think we would get another visit of that nature, but I was still curious as to who could be there.<br />
<br />
I opened the door to find a small family standing there. It consisted of a mother and father in their late thirties to early forties with two kids between nine and fourteen.<br />
<br />
“Hello…” I spoke slowly to greet the people who had come out to our cabin.<br />
<br />
The mother slowly stepped forward.<br />
<br />
“You are George Wayne, I take it?” the woman asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” I nodded slowly.<br />
<br />
She then offered me her hand, “I am Laura York-Rush. Michael York is my father.”<br />
<br />
I blinked in realization of what she had just said. This was Michael York’s family. They had come up from Billings to check on him and be with him in what was a time of need for the elderly man.<br />
<br />
“I take it you know what has happened?” I spoke.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Laura answered, “My husband and I have come up to be with my father… before… before he passes on.”<br />
<br />
“He could recover,” came Molly’s voice as she approached the entryway. She had likely overheard what had been said and was joining in. When she arrived she introduced herself, “Molly Rhoer-Wayne.”<br />
<br />
“Laura York-Rush,” Laura shook Molly’s hand, “My husband Simon Rush and our sons, Herman and Ulysses.”<br />
<br />
“I am ten,” Ulysses announced.<br />
<br />
“Fourteen,” Herman added.<br />
<br />
“A pleasure to meet you all,” I told them, “though… I wish it could be under better circumstances.”<br />
<br />
“To be honest, Mr. Wayne, we’ve been expecting something like this,” Simon spoke for the first time, “Michael York’s feud with Pierre Beauregard was fierce and both Laura and I feared that something like this would eventually happen.”<br />
<br />
“Beauregard is a threat to nobody now,” I answered.<br />
<br />
“All the same, we’ve expected something like this,” Laura sighed, “and given my father’s age, this could be his end.”<br />
<br />
“He could recover,” Molly said again.<br />
<br />
“At his age, that isn’t likely,” Laura answered.<br />
<br />
“And either way, Laura and I are here to be with him,” Simon added.<br />
<br />
“He’s currently at the hospital in Kalispell,” I told them…<br />
<br />
“Yes, a woman named Nessie told me he had been taken there,” Laura nodded, “Simon and I would have come sooner, but it took us time to make sure we could come up.”<br />
<br />
“Do you have a place to stay?” Molly asked after a moment or two.<br />
<br />
“That is partially why we are here,” Laura spoke, “hotels would be too expensive, and Herman and Ulysses will need a bit of room to explore places… and well, I’m sure you know that my father had this cabin built in the hopes that I would settle into it and inherit his ranch for him.”<br />
<br />
Molly and I nodded.<br />
<br />
“We had thought you might be willing to put up with us for a little while,” Simon spoke, “we won’t require much. Just a place to sleep at night. Herman and Ulysses can largely amuse themselves during the day and Laura and I will mostly be going down to Kalispell to be with Michael during the day.”<br />
<br />
I glanced to Molly somewhat nervously. We probably had the physical room to accommodate them, but because of our transformations into an animal species that was strictly carnivorous, we were certain we couldn’t feed them.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure that would work,” I said slowly, “Molly and I can’t eat plant matter. It’ll make us sick. Which cuts out grains, fruits, and vegetables. The only foods we have that aren’t meats are things derived from animals… eggs, cheese, and milk.”<br />
<br />
“We know about that,” Laura answered, “My father has told us a lot about you both. And we are fairly well prepared. We’ve brought cereals, pop tarts, bread, bags of rice or potatoes, and things like that. If you can share the kitchen space, we have everything we need to cook for ourselves when we’re here. And for the most part, only Herman and Ulysses will be here throughout the day.”<br />
<br />
“Would they be well behaved?” Molly asked, “George is usually out from very early in the morning to early evening with his police work… an even during the summer, I’m out for much of the day with the Summer Sun program.”<br />
<br />
“They’re good kids,” Simon answered her, “Ulysses might get into some things but Herman should be old enough to begin taking on those responsibilities.”<br />
<br />
“And if necessary, you could take Ulysses to the Summer Sun Program as well,” Laura added, “and have Herman help my father’s newest hand on the ranch…”<br />
<br />
“I’d rather work in Yellowstone,” Herman grumbled. His parents and brother didn’t hear him, but Molly and I did. Though, it wasn’t like there was anything wrong with wanting to work for the Park Service.<br />
<br />
“Well… I suppose we could allow it,” I said slowly glancing to Molly who nodded, “we have what is for now a guest room across the hall from our room that these two could sleep in… or you and your husband could take it. And whoever doesn’t do that can camp out on the floor in the living room… unless our couch folds out…”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think it does,” Molly answered.<br />
<br />
“Camping!” Ulysses voted.<br />
<br />
“I suppose I could use a sleeping bag,” Herman nodded.<br />
<br />
“Okay then…” I sighed, “I’ll go see if I can find them… I’m pretty sure Molly and I have some old ones around somewhere.”<br />
<br />
“And I’ve got our dinner to finish,” Molly nodded.<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” Laura told us and then turned to her children, “Ulysses, Herman, help us bring in our things and be sure not to be under Mr. and Mrs. Wayne’s feet.”<br />
<br />
“Mr. and Mrs. Wayne are my parents,” I answered, “call me George.”<br />
<br />
“I’d prefer Molly.”<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Settling the Rush family in went quickly and fairly easily. Simon and Laura had brought a lot of things to allow them to take care of themselves while they were staying. Other then space to sleep, the only thing that Molly and I had to provide was the meat to go with the side dishes they had brought. It wasn’t too much of a problem, and with  the fall hunting season, Molly and I figured we could afford it.<br />
<br />
And their promises on their time there also proved accurate. According to Molly, Simon and Laura left for Kalispell when  she left for work. Sometimes Herman and Ulysses went with them, and sometimes they didn’t. Sometimes Ulysses went in with Molly to the Summer Sun program and Herman amused himself hiking in the woods around our cabin. I came home from work one evening to find him sketching several different looking pine cones. And of course, like all kids, they enjoyed the pool Molly and I had  in the backyard.<br />
<br />
Toward the end of the week, the first signs of progress in the case to catch Washerman came through. One was a Federally issued warrant that would allow law enforcement agencies to go into Glacier National Park and find and arrest Horace Washerman for his criminal activities around Columbia Falls. It had arrived while Officer Barnes and I had been out on patrol and was  received by Officer Won at our station. Officer Barnes and I learned about it when we came in at the end of our morning patrol for lunch.<br />
<br />
“Well… this is progress,” Officer Barnes commented, “we have the warrant.”<br />
<br />
“This is only a copy of the warrant,” Officer Won answered with a sigh.<br />
<br />
I sensed some frustration on his part as well. Since Washerman had been going from a National Park and into the state of Montana, that essentially made the case a Federal case and the responsibility of the FBI or some other Federal government agency. Because of that, Officer Won’s duties on the case had largely been reduced to that of a liaison between the Columbia Falls Police Department and the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office and the FBI. <br />
<br />
And just as Officer Barnes and I wanted to remain on the case after Officer Won took it over because of my personal relationship to both Michael York but to Frank Rhoer and his family, Officer Won wanted to remain on the case even though it was now a Federal issue. But I knew that just as Officer Won had the right to ignore Officer Barnes and I when he took over the case, the FBI could ignore both of us, unless something made them think they needed the additional manpower.<br />
<br />
“The real warrant will be with the FBI Agents that carry out the arrest,” Officer Won continued, “this is merely a formality to assure that all the proper procedures are followed. Washerman may be brought back here to await trial, and that is why we received a copy of the warrant.”<br />
<br />
“I suppose the only thing left then would be to ask if we could assist in the arrest?” Officer Barnes then mused.<br />
<br />
I turned one hear as I heard footsteps approaching, but kept my focus on the conversation between Officers Won and Barnes.<br />
<br />
“They’ll only let us in if they feel they need the additional manpower,” Officer Won answered.<br />
<br />
The voice that spoke next made both Officer Barnes and Officer Won jump. It belonged to whoever I had heard walking toward us, so I knew someone was here.<br />
<br />
“And we will.”<br />
<br />
I turned to see that it was he same two FBI agents that had come to collect the male Pit Bull gang members, back when Beauregard had just been caught and was waiting to go to Helena for trial. Agent Alexander Harris and Agent Matthew Blustunn.<br />
<br />
“Agent Harris of the FBI, this is my partner, Agent Blustunn,” Agent Harris introduced himself and his partner.<br />
<br />
“Officer Won, Flathead County Sheriff’s Office,” Officer Won answered.<br />
<br />
“Officer Barnes, Columbia Falls PD,” Officer Barnes added, “You need our help?”<br />
<br />
“We believe so,” Agent Harris nodded, “Is there a place where we can sit down?”<br />
<br />
Officer Won nodded and lead them to the station’s interrogation room. Additional chairs were brought in. <br />
<br />
“So, what do you need our help with?” Officer Won asked.<br />
<br />
“We may need some help in capturing Washerman,” Agent Blustunn spoke after a few moments, “we did some digging as to what Washerman had been doing before he decided to vandalize your local ranches.”<br />
<br />
“What did you find out?” Officer Barnes asked, sounding curious.<br />
<br />
“Before leaving his home in Northern California, he placed an order with Gen-U-Tech for the Animatrix Serum,” Agent Harris answered, “he remained at his home until it arrived, and according to our sources, that is when he left.”<br />
<br />
“He hasn’t taken it yet,” I told them, “his scent where I found it was human.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe, but given the species he ordered… if he does take it, we could have  problem,” Agent Harris replied.<br />
<br />
“What species was it?” Officer Won asked.<br />
<br />
“Bison… buffalo… take your pick,” Agent Harris answered, “Big enough to do damage after being shot and far stronger then we are… we’ll need Officer Wayne’s strength should he take the serum when confronted.”<br />
<br />
“They’re still stronger then me,” I answered.<br />
<br />
“Maybe, but turning half of our agents into bison or buffalo… whatever, or into some larger animal species isn’t an option,” Agent Blustunn replied, “and we’d prefer it if we could bring him in alive. So Officer Wayne is our best choice.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll all do what we can to help,” I promised them, though I felt very uneasy about this.<br />
<br />
If Washerman took the serum and resisted arrest, subduing a two thousand pound bison would be difficult for a five hundred fifty five pound tiger to do. Now, tigers did kill Gaur in India, which were massive animals in their own right, but tigers attacked from behind to avoid the animal’s horns. If Washerman took the serum, his newly grown horns would be facing me directly.<br />
<br />
This wasn’t going to be easy.</p>
