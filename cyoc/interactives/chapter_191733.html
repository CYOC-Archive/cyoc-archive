<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris was living large. Even though he had originally planned to get a different job after retiring from his corrupt police force, his ‘renegotiated’ retirement fund was covering all of his expenses and then some.<br />
<br />
He had been on a couple of dates with a couple of different handsome guys. Even had a passionate night of love-making with one of them. There was just a little something missing. He’d become addicted to the power to alter reality offered by that gun. He thought about how he got the married police chief Ernie to fuck him. He wanted something exciting and different.<br />
<br />
While on a walk contemplating what to do with his vast free time, Chris was walking by the police chief’s house. His fifteen year old son, Jason, was shooting hoops in a t-shirt and basketball shorts. Chris remembered what it was like to be that young. Fewer aches and pains, and a more sensitive dick. He wished for a second that he could experience being Jason. Then he remembered that his special gun had other settings.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jason, come over here and talk with me for a sec,” said Chris from next to a bunch of hedges that would obscure them from neighborly view.<br />
<br />
“Um, what’s up Mr.Redfield? We never talk,” said the curious if not suspicious fifteen year-old who had gone over to the hedges with Chris.<br />
<br />
“How would you like to be me for a while? Like a day or so,” offered Chris without a hint of irony.<br />
<br />
“Ha ha, very funny. We both know that’s not possible,” said Jason.<br />
<br />
Switching the gun to swap, the labels on the laser buttons now read “subject one (or gun holder)” and “subject two”. Chris fired the subject one beam at himself and then the subject two beam at Jason.<br />
<br />
Instantly Chris was looking at his former body from the perspective of Jason’s body. Despite being in Jason’s body now, Chris still had the gun once again. This must be why subject one is supposed to be the gun holder, so that she or he would end up with the gun once again.<br />
<br />
“So now you see that it is possible. Do you wanna stay swapped for a little while?” Asked Chris. He really wanted to go explore this new body but he was trying to be patient.<br />
<br />
“This is incredible! Yes I’ll be you for a bit!! But what about work? I don’t know how to be a cop,” said Jason from his new hairy 39 year-old body.<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to worry about work, I actually just retired. My credit card is in the cabinet above the fridge for when you need to buy yourself stuff to eat, and there is a key to my house in m— your pocket. Oh, and one more thing,” said Chris, changing the gun to sexuality mode again. He tried shooting his ex body with the gayer laser so that Jason wouldn’t do anything straight in his body while he was in Jason. To his surprise the laser wouldn’t fire.<br />
<br />
“Oh I see, you must’ve already been gay,” said Chris.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I am. Just don’t tell my dad. Wait that gun could also make people gay? Sweet! Well I’m off to find out what a grown man’s orgasm feels like. You don’t mind do you?” Asked Jason, eager to go fuck his new temporary body.<br />
<br />
“Not at all. I’ll be doing the same in your body if that’s okay,” said Chris blushing with his new smooth cheeks.<br />
<br />
“That’s hot actually. See ya later,” said Jason, walking towards his new bachelor pad, adjusting his boner.<br />
<br />
Chris walked into his new house. It turned him on to no end that Ernie was now his biological father. He would have to wait several hours for ‘daddy’ to be home though. In the mean time he wanted to acquainted with his new body.<br />
<br />
It took some time to figure out where his new bedroom is. He was happy to find a full length mirror in it. Wasting no time, Chris stripped his body down to its underwear. Another fan of the white briefs. Worked for Chris. He marveled at how smooth and skinny this body was. His old 39 year-old body wasn’t fat, but this was a level of skinny Chris hadn’t been since he was probably fifteen the first time. He teased his nipples, grabbed his little booty and made fuck me expressions in the mirror. He was really the chief’s son!<br />
<br />
His eyes when to his new package in the briefs. It was a very small bulge and Chris could make out the head of his new penis through the fabric. He pulled the waistband and was met with a small dick and balls. Most men would be horrified to be in a body with a smaller set of dick and balls, but Chris was intrigued. Just looking at it made his penis grow to it’s full length of 3.5 inches. It was so sensitive to the touch, but he didn’t want to jerk off yet.<br />
<br />
Putting back on the young man’s clothes, Chris did pushups, sit-ups and squats while waiting for his new dad to come home. It felt so nice keeping this great body in shape.<br />
<br />
Chris heard a car park in the driveway. His wish that it was Jason’s dad instead of his mom home first came true. Ernie walked towards the house, briefcase in hand. As soon as he walked through the door, Chris threw his arms around him saying, “Daddy!”<br />
<br />
“Jason you’re a full grown man, since when do you call me daddy??” Said Ernie.<br />
<br />
“Well when did you get this great big ass,” said Chris, moving his young hands down to his new father’s backside and hungrily groping the round cheeks.<br />
<br />
“Son, what’s gotten into you?” Said Ernie, pushing his son off of him by the shoulders and looking him in the eyes.<br />
<br />
“I’m not Jason, that’s what. I’m Chris Redfield. I used the same transformation gun to swap with your son that I used to turn you gay,” explained Chris.<br />
<br />
“That’s why I suddenly have an interest in men and not women?? And that’s really you in there Chris?” Asked Ernie.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I turned you gay cause I wanted a ride on your big cock. And yes it’s really me. At last years Christmas party you got so wasted you sand Britney Spears,” said Chris for proof, “I figured that being in your son’s body, you and I could cheat on your wife under the same roof. She’s not going to suspect a father and son.”<br />
<br />
“Are you crazy?? I can’t have sex with my son’s body just because you’re in it!” Disputed Ernie.<br />
<br />
“Fine. Until you agree to have sex with me, I’m keeping this,” said Chris firing a body part swap beam at Ernie’s crotch and then his own.<br />
<br />
Chris pulled down his shorts and underwear, revealing that he now had Ernie’s penis and balls.<br />
<br />
“What?? You can’t!!” Said Ernie, pulling down his own pants and underwear. Sure enough, his son’s small cock and balls were where his should’ve been. It was an oddly erotic sight. A muscular older man having such a small package and a skinny fifteen year old with a big fat long cock and low hanging balls. Both with their pants down, taking in their new reality.<br />
<br />
“Oh and Jason and I are planning to swap back in about a day, so unless you want him inheriting your dick and balls, I’d change my stance on incest if I were you. I’ll be in my room, dad,” said Chris, giving his biological father a quick kiss on the lips.</p>
