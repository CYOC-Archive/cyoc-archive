<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">10 minutes later Kate carefully laid down on the bed beside the still sleeping Tom. She put her arm around him and spooned against his large bum. She flicked his dress down so he was no longer exposing himself. She noticed the stain on the dress and was momentarily annoyed. Then she got philosophical, before she was done there might be more stains to worry about.<br />
<br />
Kate reached across and cupped Tom’s breast with her right hand. She guessed they were C-cups, they were certainly bigger than her own. She felt the nipple through the satin. Tom stirred and rolled over so he was facing her. He was still very sleepy. Before he could say anything she pressed her lips against his. She felt the familiar feeling of his whiskers against her face. She also felt the unfamiliar feeling of his breasts pushing against her own. <br />
<br />
Kate enjoyed Tom’s reactions as he woke up. Initially he was pleased to see Kate beside him and in her sexy new nightie. Then there was shock on his face as he remembered he was in Kerry’s body and caught wearing Kate’s good dress.<br />
<br />
He called out “Kate!” and of course it was Kerry’s feminine voice that came out. Kate put her finger to his lips and said “Shush!” She then recommenced the kiss and pushed her chest harder into his. At the same time her hand caressed his satin clad bum.<br />
It took a few more moments for Tom to realise he wasn’t in trouble. Then he responded. His own left arm reached across Kate and pulled her even tighter into an embrace. He felt the material of Kate&#39;s short nightie and realised she had no underwear on underneath.<br />
<br />
After the initial kiss and embrace, Tom not so reluctantly lay on his back and allowed his new body to be explored by his wife. Kate explored her newly acquired lesbian desires. She gave him a very gentle breast massage. She loved how his soft melons filled out the bodice of her dress. She remembered how her own breasts had seemed a bit inadequate. She was also mesmerised by how his nipples responded to her touch. She knew her own did the same but it was fascinating seeing the same reaction on her husband.<br />
<br />
She then positioned herself between Tom’s legs and lifted his dress to once more expose his newly acquired pussy. Kate traced her finger over his tattoo then felt the smoothness of his groin. Kate reasoned Kerry must have undergone electrolysis. There were no signs of hairs at all. Despite being a bridesmaid she and Kerry had not being close enough to discuss such personal issues.<br />
<br />
Next Kate silently explored Tom’s vulva. He was massaging his own breasts as Kate slipped her finger between his pussy lips. He was very moist. Kate had never closely examined another woman’s pussy. She opened Tom’s flaps gently and examined him. He was bright pink inside. It was like looking inside a toothless mouth. It wasn’t particularly pretty but it was nicer than then his wrinkly penis. She located his vagina, urethra and clitoris. His clitoris seemed smaller than her own. <br />
<br />
Her eyes went back to Tom’s vagina. It was hard to imagine it would open enough to allow a penis inside, the hole seemed quite tiny, but no doubt it would. She had remembered talk in the bridesmaids dressing room that Michael was ‘more than adequate’. This pussy had no doubt been penetrated many times. <br />
<br />
But then Kate thought about it more. Was that actually the case? This was actually a pussy that was a copy of one that had been penetrated many times. Tom as a female was no doubt a virgin though he had clearly been penetrated by his own fingers last night. <br />
<br />
“What are you doing down there?” Tom’s female voice asked.<br />
<br />
“Just looking. I’ve never had a chance to check out another woman’s pussy before” Kate gently pushed her finger knuckle deep into Tom’s vagina. “How does that feel?”<br />
<br />
“Nice. But it feels better when you touch my clitoris”<br />
<br />
“An expert on female anatomy now are we? Let me see what I can do” Kate lifted the flap covering his clit. She gently touched his nub with the finger she had just removed from his vagina. Her finger was gooey, she wiped the slime gently onto his clit. “Like this?” Kate asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes! that’s the spot”<br />
<br />
Kate continued to stimulate Tom. She watched as his vagina invited penetration. He was certainly producing plenty of juice. His clitoris noticeably swelled. That and the whimpering confirmed that she was being nice and gentle. <br />
<br />
Kate dipped her finger into Tom’s vagina again. It was clearly asking to be filled. She regretted she could not do that. She had never owned a dildo or a vibrator, that probably made her a bit of a prude. She wished she had one handy now. In her imagination she was pushing a big rubber penis into Tom. In reality she was pushing her index finger into him.<br />
<br />
She now used two hands. Her left index finger was inside Tom’s vagina while her right finger gently rubbed his clitoris. It didn’t take long before she felt the muscles around her left finger contracting. She pulled her finger out.<br />
<br />
“No don’t stop” Tom gasped. “Do you have anything? You could put in there?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t. I always relied on you to provide that sort of equipment”<br />
<br />
Tom giggled with Kerry’s voice “I’m a bit inadequate in that department at the moment”<br />
<br />
“If we ever do this again. I might have to make a special purchase. Be more prepared” <br />
 <br />
“Well I’m hoping my own equipment will return. I really don’t want to stay like this”<br />
<br />
“I want my husband back as well. I have needs also”</p>
