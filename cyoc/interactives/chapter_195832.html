<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Guy stepped out onto the roof of the freshman dorm, and there he was just as expected. Linus rocked naked in his hammock, hard to tell where the ropes ended and his fur began, as he had his early morning blazing session. He was also slowly jerking himself off, not that that bothered Guy, he had had the cock in his mouth once last year.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surprised you didn&#39;t move to the new dorm&#39;s roof.&quot; Guy commented as he strode over to the edge of the roof to look down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, you can see it from the top floor of the library.&quot; Linus answered with a lazy wave in the direction of their dorm. This roof was nicely secluded, with most sightlines blocked by tall trees. The shaggy dog took another toke from his joint and looked at Guy, just waiting patiently for the cat to get around to business.<br />
<br />
&quot;Need some flakes.&quot; Guy finally spoke up. &quot;And since Mac graduated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Linus reached down and dug into his backpack, coming up with a ziplock baggie full of &#39;nip and tossed it lightly in Guy&#39;s direction.  The Lynx caught it and popped it open, giving a quick sniff before sealing it back up. The one sniff enough to get his eyes looking a little unfocused for a moment, pupils wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll want to hook up with Shro. Freshman, he&#39;s..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Curt&#39;s roommate. Yeah.&quot; Guy said with a nod. He hadn&#39;t hung around the freshman much, but William was insistent on being close to Milo, which meant he was already up to date on some of them, having met others. Linus just nodded, he didn&#39;t even look surprised. &quot;He got anything that&#39;ll work on boars?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pot, maybe? I dunno. He would.&quot; Linus rolled his head towards Guy, one eye peeking through the shag rug he called fur. &quot;So, that&#39;s true then? You and one of the boar brothers? Do they really, like, gush? I mean, that&#39;s not just an internet thing, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Guy just grinned as he wiggled the bag of flake before tucking it in his pocket. &quot;I&#39;ll catch you later, Linus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not fair, dude. Not fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Dare stepped into the dorm room expecting it to be empty. It wasn&#39;t. Milo stood by his bed, unpacking and dressed in only a pair of black boxer briefs. The skunk found himself staring wide-eyed at the sight. When had Milo gotten so buff? Sure he had seen the boar getting steadily bigger, but something about not having him around the last couple days just made it all the more obvious. He felt small, he never felt small around a guy, but now he did and it was a good feeling, and he wanted those arms wrapped around him.<br />
<br />
He gulped softly when he let his eyes roam a bit downwards. Milo&#39;s cock had changed and that bulge he sported in the front of those brief must be holding a massive pair. Dare felt his nose twitching, and his own cock stiffening in his pants.<br />
<br />
<i>Waiting until the night until everyone was asleep. Sneaking on to his computer and typing in those two little words. Nude Boar. His discovery of something that drove him wild, and his need to see it. The thought that a long time dream may be coming true when he saw his roommate&#39;s tusks for the first time.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Earth to Dare.&quot; Dare blink and stared at Milo. He had asked him something, what had he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, it was nice having the whole room to myself.&quot; Dare replied, though without any of his usual bite, walking over to his bed to set down his backpack.<br />
<br />
&quot;I missed you too, Dare.&quot; Dare felt his ears twitching. It wasn&#39;t fair that one guy could do this to him. That any guy could do this to him.  &quot;Answer me honestly, do you really want to try this? You and me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dare sniffed and rubbed the back of his hand at one of his eyes. Was he.. crying? Damn it, Milo. But after a moment he nodded. &quot;I do. Fuck me, but I do.&quot; He felt a pair of strong arms wrap around him from behind, the mix of smells he associated with Milo strong in his nose. Cedar shampoo, a bit of boar musk, and now the faint hint of engine grease.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about I do something for you? All you have to do is just enjoy it.&quot; Milo whispered into his ear, his hands already working at unfastening Dare&#39;s jeans which soon fell to the floor in a heap, his underwear pushed down to follow it a moment later.<br />
<br />
<i>Enjoy it and try not freak out and run off.</i> Dare thought as he lifted his arms so Milo could peel his shirt off of him. Milo&#39;s hand found that stupid nipple piercing almost immediately, giving it a tweak that almost made  Dare bust is load right there. &quot;Okay, I think we can do that.&quot; Dare tried to sound more confident than he felt.<br />
<br />
He sat on the bed with a little urging from Milo, as the boar knelt down in front of him. Dare started hyperbentilating. <i>This is all a joke. A mean joke. He&#39;s going to push me back and make fun of me for even thinking he..</i> The thoughts stopped dead as he felt Milo&#39;s muzzle wrap around his cock.<br />
<br />
Milo wore a look of concentration as Dare felt that tongue along his shaft, the careful way the boar moved to avoid teeth and suddenly it all came crashing down on him in sudden realization. <i>This is as new to him as it is to me.</i> &quot;Milo..&quot; Dare touched the side of the boar&#39;s face. &quot;Stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Milo began immediately, pulling off Dare&#39;s cock when told to stop. &quot;I..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, Milo.&quot; Dare said, putting a finger on Milo&#39;s snout. &quot;I want to do this together. so.. take off that underwear and climb up here before I change my mind. Okay? And don&#39;t you..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell anyone, I know.&quot; Milo said as he shimmied out of his underwear. Dare couldn&#39;t help but stare at the two heavy balls below Milo&#39;s sheathe. So big, just like he imagined in his time sneaking peaks of porn on the family computer. Milo&#39;s shaft was out as well, thick and pink with a spiraled shape. Daryl would have been freaking out, but Dare stared at the shaft, amazed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No. Don&#39;t cheat by playing with the piercing. Makes me cum too fast.&quot; Dare snorted and Milo burst into a small laugh that died when he noticed where Dare&#39;s eyes were lingering. His shuffled a bit, looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s weird, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Milo moved a little to cover himself with a hand, but Dare grabbed his arm. God, it was like stone under that bristly fur. How dare he get so.. muscly. Still Milo stopped at the touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just different.&quot; Dare said, not willing to admit that he found it more than fascinating. It was perfect, it was.. Dare kicked himself mentally. It was a fucking kink. He had a kink for boar dick. And he didn&#39;t care. He scooted back on his bead, pulling Milo by the arm to follow him. It took them a few tries to get in a comfortable position, where each could get their muzzle around the other&#39;s shaft.<br />
<br />
It was awkward, it was weird, and it was the best moment Dare had had at this stupid school. Or any school, really. Once he figured out Milo liked having a tongue stuck down the middle of that corkscrew shaft it was over, and Dare had the boar practically squirming. Not that Milo wasn&#39;t figuring out things either, like a little ball tugging got Dare ramped up quickly.<br />
<br />
Dare&#39;s ears lay flat back as he let out a soft moan, he couldn&#39;t hold himself back any longer. He came into his boar&#39;s muzzle, Milo happily lapping it up as Dare continued to work on him. Though soon a small grunt came from Milo, and his eyes went wide. &quot;Dare. Careful, I..&quot; He almost tried to pull the skunk of his cock as it twitched, but he fell to the bed as he started to cum.<br />
<br />
Dare knew what was coming. He had seen the videos, what boars were famous for. He had to know. Musky, salty seed filled his mouth, and for a few seconds it seemed like he was going to keep up, then is spilled from his mouth and he had to pull back. He could only watch as the volcano kept erupting, making a expanding puddle of pearly fluids along Milo&#39;s stomach and thighs and down onto the sheets. It seemed to just go on and on, Dare sat transfixed by the display.<br />
<br />
Milo looked sheepish as his flow stopped and he met Dare&#39;s eyes. The skunk could feel the seed on his muzzle, the bit down his chin. &quot;Dare, I&#39;m sorry. I forgot. It&#39;s only the second time I.. What are you? No! No!&quot; Dare lunged forward and locked Milo into a kiss, sharing his own mess with him. The boar sank into the messy kiss, only breaking it for a bit to help Dare lick his muzzle clean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laundry duty is totally your problem from now on.&quot; Dare said with his characteristic mischievous grin, licking Milo&#39;s snout playfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you promise not to run off anymore.&quot; Milo said as he wrapped an arm around Dare and pulled him close.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t promise to be perfect. But I&#39;ll let you know if I need to stop instead of just running.&quot; Dare said, resting his head on Milo&#39;s chest. &quot;I still need to work through some crap, but, I know I want to try this. Us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good thing you like extra frosting, huh?&quot; Milo said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dork.&quot;</p>
