<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I just stood there in my sister's swimsuit with a towel wrapped around me. I suddenly realized that I had the towel wrapped around me like a girl, covering my chest. What the hell was going on. My mind hadn't slipped for awhile but today it slipped so far that I went to the pool wearing my sister's swimsuit. Now without even thinking about it I had wrapped a towel around me like a girl. Katherine had said that I was cute but didn't say anything about me wearing her swimsuit. Something was definitely wrong here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Marcus, play dress-up and tea party with me&quot; Katherine said. Then she added something that I dreaded. &quot;Pretty please Marcus&quot; Katherine pleaded with those sad puppy dog eyes all little girls seem to be able to do. Before I knew it I dropped the towel and was about to say yes when I saw Thomas come up behind Katherine. I couldn't hide or pick up the towel fast enough to cover myself.<br />
Thomas had seen me in my sister's swimsuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you doing Marcus!?!&quot; Thomas asked. &quot;And what the fuck happened to your room!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'm losing my mind Thomas!&quot; I said as I broke down and cried. I sat down on my bed and cried my eyes out.<br />
<br />
Thomas waited until I had stopped crying before he said &quot;Tell me what's going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It started the day we found that medallion&quot; I said. &quot;I had placed it on the table while I cleaned out Katherine's closet. I then caught Katherine wearing that medallion and when I told her to take it off she threw it on the floor and it cracked nearly in two. When I picked it up to see what damage had been done I just stared at it. Suddenly my mind slipped and I thought about trying on one of Katherine's dresses or outfits. I was nearly to her room when Mommy came home. That brought me back to reality and I went to my room.<br />
After that my mind continued to slip and I kept thinking if I would be as pretty as the girls I saw when I grew up and wanting a dress just like the ones they wore when I was their age. When that happened I was able to shake my head to bring me back to reality. Then there was the incident in the cafeteria. My mind had slipped further than it had before. I was embarrassed by it so I ducked into the restroom and sat down in a stall. When I heard girl's voices I<br />
realized that the restroom I had ducked into so naturally was the girls restroom. I needed to go so I pulled down my pants and underwear and went. While I was going I thought about how Mommy would be so proud of me. When I got home no one was here and my mind slipped again. I went into Katherine's room and dressed up as a ballerina. I even put on a pair of her panties and laid down with a doll. I was able to take off the ballerina costume before anyone saw<br />
me but I kept the panties on. Shortly after that I was trying to figure out what was causing this and thought that it could have been the medallion. I couldn't find it though. Then I thought that maybe Katherine's clothes might have done this. I went down to the basement and found the last dress that I had packed up. I picked it up and said in my mind for it to take back what was happening. After that my mind didn't slip again until today. I was home alone and<br />
decided to go swimming. I was coming to my room to get my trunks when my mind slipped and I went into Katherine's room. I decided that a one-piece would look cuter than a bikini and so I pulled out this swimsuit. I pulled on one of Katherine s tee shirts and a pair of her shorts. I put on a pair of her sandals. I picked out a towel and then I picked up my 'icky' boy clothes, dropped them off in my room, and grabbed some money for the pool. I walked all the way to the pool, paid to get in, and went into the women's changing room before I was able to think clearly again. I decided that I had gone that far and I wanted to go swimming so I did. I was expecting someone to comment on how weird I was or my parents were. The only comment came from a lifeguard and he said that I was a cute girl and asked if I knew where my Mommy was. After a couple of hours I came home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't anyone notice your dick?&quot; Thomas asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had tucked it between my legs&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Thomas said. &quot;Now why is your room like this? And why are your sister's clothes fitting you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My room has kept changing along with me&quot; I said. &quot;I wasn't like this a few weeks ago. I was about the same height as you but my body has changed. Now I look like I'm about nine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Thomas said. &quot;We need to find out how this happened and if there is a way to reverse it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might be able to help there&quot; my mommy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy!&quot; I cried and rushed over to hug her.<br />
<br />
As Mommy hugged me back she said &quot;I'm sorry Marcus. I thought that if I pretended not to notice anything that you would adjust faster. I even told Katherine to pretend that nothing was happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is this happening Mommy?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you had found that medallion&quot; my mommy said. &quot;I've been doing some research on it. By the way some of the days I was called into work were actually days spent researching the medallion. It turns out that the medallion was suppose to transform whoever wore it and touched some clothing to it. The person would then transform into the person who had worn that clothing as they were the last time they wore it. If the clothing hadn't been worn before then the person would transform into someone who would wear it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I didn't wear the medallion or touch any clothes to it&quot; I said. I knew that my mind had slipped again and had been slipping since I started telling Thomas what had happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; my mommy said. &quot;I've been asking around about that. As far as anyone can figure out it's because the medallion broke. The power was disrupted so when you touched it it started to transform you based on what clothing you last touched. What you had touched last was a new dress I had bought for Katherine. It had never been worn. And instead of transforming you instantly like it was suppose to it's<br />
doing it slowly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does his mind keep slipping?&quot; Thomas asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The medallion is also suppose to alter reality&quot; my mommy said. &quot;Since the medallion was broken reality is shifting slowly. It seems like as long as he keeps thinking of himself as Marcus that he'll be stuck halfway.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the sound of my name my mind snapped back and I was once again embarrassed. I would be stuck like this as long as people kept calling me Marcus and I would continue to be embarrassed. I would have to start thinking of myself as a girl and a girl's name. &quot;What will my name be Mom?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'll let you decide that&quot; my mom said. &quot;It will be your new name after all. I want you to be comfortable with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I have some time to think about it?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you can&quot; my mom said. &quot;Now why don't you change into something else. You can use some of Katherine's clothes if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought about Katherine begging me to play dress-up and tea party with her. I looked at Katherine and said &quot;I'll play dress-up with you. I might as well get used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank you Marcus!&quot; Katherine said as she hugged me.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about school?&quot; Thomas asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well until Marcus decides on a name he should wear his boy clothes&quot; my mom said. &quot;He can wear girl clothes outside of school.&quot; I knew that my mom was right.</p>
