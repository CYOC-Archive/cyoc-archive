<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bruce was sound asleep, curled up beside his enormous hunk of a little brother. Andrew rested with both hands behind his head, staring up at the ceiling of his new house. His frame took up the majority of the bed, and his elbows nearly reached each end beside him. Andrew smiled as he smelled a whiff of Bruce&#39;s old cologne through the fog of sex and sweat. He let the new memories wash away his old ones and started recounting how his life branched differently with this new reality.<br />
<br />
At age 8, Andrew was brought to the hospital because he complained about the intense pain he felt in his shins, back, and arms. The doctors reassured his parents that he was simply growing, and that his bones were experiencing normal growth spurts for pre-pubescent children. They prescribed him some pain-relieving medicine and sent the family on their way. However, the pangs in his bones didn&#39;t stop after a few weeks. They escalated until one morning little Andrew couldn&#39;t even get out of bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Andy!&quot; Bruce knocked on the door forcefully. &quot;You&#39;re gonna be late for school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Big bro, can you tell mom and dad that I can&#39;t go to school today? My legs REALLY hurt today.&quot; Andrew whined from his bed. He squirmed, feeling like the blankets were hugging him too tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;ll get you some medicine. But you gotta stop being a wuss.&quot; Bruce impatiently walked in yanked the blankets off of Andrew. &quot;You need to- Woah! What happened to you?&quot; Bruce&#39;s jaw dropped at Andrew&#39;s new dimensions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-what?&quot; Andrew blinked and looked down. His legs! Andrew&#39;s eyes bugged out as he saw his freakishly long legs. His ankles stretched past the bottom of his PJ&#39;s by at least a foot. His thighs squeezed against the rest of it; the seams were already worn and basically transparent. Andrew reached down to feel his knees, to make sure this wasn&#39;t just a dream, but was caught off-guard by the arm that certainly didn&#39;t look like it belonged to him. He laid there, mesmerized by his new proportional hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, bro. I&#39;ve never seen a growth spurt like this before.&quot; Bruce crossed his arms in amusement. Andrew looked like a skinny teenager dressed in children&#39;s clothing for a prank. The buttons on the PJ&#39;s were ready to burst; the pale skin underneath revealing a flat stomach.<br />
<br />
The two brothers heard the thumping of heavy footsteps outside the doorway. &quot;Bruce, you know your mother doesn&#39;t like it when you curse. I don&#39;t care about it myself, but be mindful of your br-&quot; he halted at the doorway. &quot;Geezus, son! What the hell happened to you?&quot; Bruce shot his dad an annoyed glance. His dad all but flew to Andrew&#39;s side and checked his forehead, and began examining the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;My legs really hurt, dad. Can I stay home from school today?&quot; Andrew gave his best impression of being sick.<br />
<br />
Dad looked over at Andrew&#39;s legs, then back at him. &quot;Alright, Andrew. You can stay home today.&quot; He stood up straight from the bed, his frame blocking most of the sunlight from the window behind him. &quot;Heh, and here I thought it skipped a generation.&quot; He put his hands on his hips, his lats flaring out like wings, and beamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what do you mean, dad?&quot; Bruce asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y&#39;see son, our family has a special gene in our pool that&#39;s so rare, only 1 in a million people have it. They call it the Mega Puberty gene. It makes &#39;ya a man faster than anyone else around you. This gene used to be more common when most people couldn&#39;t live past 25, but now with science and all that the gene isn&#39;t really needed no more.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two brothers watched in fascination as their dad explained, his muscles seemingly twitching every now and then. His t-shirt clung to his meaty slabs called pecs and showed dark stains under his armpits. Bruce watched closely at the dark spots on his chest, and couldn&#39;t tell if the nipples were getting erect or making the shirt wet, but the spots almost seemed to grow wider. Andrew hung on to the word &quot;man&quot; and zoned out into his fantasy of being bigger than all the kids at school.  He imagined his voice to be as gruff as his dad&#39;s, sporting thick muscles, but not as hairy as his old man&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;It does some other things, too. But I&#39;ll tell you boys when yer&#39; older.&quot; His voice became distant, the light behind him turned a little brighter, and then he vanished, along with the rest of Andrew&#39;s memory.<br />
<br />
Andrew was looking at his ceiling again, and peered down at his chest. Even with his arms stretched outwards, his chest was still plump as two golden-brown pillows, and what&#39;s more noticeable was the pert, finger-thick nipples that stuck out 2 inches from his chest. His mouth started to water uncontrollably, and the plucked at one with his free arm that Bruce didn&#39;t use as a pillow.  Andrew groaned in bliss; his hips bucked and his cock jerked at the sudden stimulation. His brother turned away and fell back into deep sleep, sticking his used ass towards Andrew. He would&#39;ve admired that swimmer&#39;s lithe bubble butt, but his attention was kept on the trickle of clear fluid that covered Andy&#39;s fingers and pulsing nipple.<br />
<br />
Now drooling, Andrew used all his willpower to reach across the night stand and grab a card from the wish machine instead of tweaking himself again. &quot;I wish,&quot; he panted, &quot;I knew why my nipples are doing this.&quot;</p>
