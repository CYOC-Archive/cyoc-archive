<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan had just bleated again. His voice had changed as did his larynx become as the devils desired to make of it, leaving him lacking the ability to speak as talk human style. This lack of speech in her brother made Kat feel further elated by her witchery she did to degrade Dan. Kat had long-since wanted to rid her life of her common brother, he trying to act as be so very good in everything he did. She had used her brother as an experiment of how her witchery craft would as could work on others she planned to degrade someday.<br />
<br />
Although Dan had changed a lot to looking like he was born a satyr, he had gained more goaty animal attributes what made him look and feel more like he was an animal. Yet he could stand upright still as walking on two legs, two feet, and with cloven hooves. Again was his sense of personal dignity keeping him struggling to retain what little of his humanity that he could see left to him.<br />
<br />
Head wise as facially, Dan had by then his head being completely goat like with horns, pointed, furry ears, a muzzle and a goaty beard. His neck was a bit longer and as well fur covered, as was his entire body, arms, hands, legs and feet furred. From the navel region and downward, Dan had become wholly like that of being a male goat. He had not agreed to all of what Kat did to him, but once she started his transforming, he had not the ability to stop what he had no control.<br />
<br />
Katherine, (Kat) had used the pretense of asking her brother to look like he was a Greek satyr for then being an artist model for a mutual friend Susan. What Kat did to Dan had him looking more like an animal than him being a satyr. As much that Kat liked what she did to Dan, he after his head changed, it with his mind began to conform to thinking as doing what he being a goat animal would find as preferable to do; but taunted still by his memories of when human, he should act with some decent sense of respecting the preferences of others.<br />
<br />
Dan had when in the singular presence of his sister coaxing him on, he did masturbate his goat cock, expelling that of his still human male semen, causing his goaty testes to begin producing only goat semen. Dan would be the first to admit that because of what Kat did to him, he rather liked his much enhanced maleness, as how his scrotum hung weighty between his furred legs. The mentality of being an animal, as such a male goat was forcing its beastly style of addiction over Dan, changing his preferred ideals of what was beautiful. Dan saw Kat as being of another kind and not of his kind or species. He was thinking after much having changed to look like as work by becoming goatish, sniffed the wafting air currents for the scent of some other goat, a female frothing to have a buck come and mate with her.<br />
<br />
His loud cried bleat did something else, it caused a mother and more practiced a witch to stop what she was attending to, and go to check on what she heard. As Kat had her back to her bedroom door, and Dan was standing there being the essence of what his witch sister wanted him to be, in walked their mother to see the mayhem happening in her family.<br />
<br />
&quot;KATHERINE, if that goat is as was what I suspect to be my son Daniel, your only brother, then you are in BIG trouble!&quot; Mom said showing the force behind her tersely angry sounding voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baa-naa...,&quot; Dan bleating cried to try his best as to convey that he knew her to be his mother and of what Kat had so changed him to become, a male goat!<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have suspected that you, my daughter acting so often as self-righteous, would when deemed your powers of witchery as natural, being a novice, had to take your hate and jealousy upon your brother. <br />
<br />
So then, you wished to make Dan feel goaded, by becoming a goat animal! I trust then you have as a personal preference of some sensual delight for goats. If Dan is as I might expect you changed him, he of his maleness is the ideal length and contours of what you would love then to feel poked up inside your sensually aroused body. If that is indeed your wish I might let your changed brother take you to where he shall need to reside and when there have him dominate you.<br />
<br />
No, do not try to pick an argument with me about your rights to do with non-magical types , as such Dan there. I am your and his mother, so by transforming him, you did me an injustice, as much to your father as well. Maybe you do not as yet understand or know, but common humans like was Dan, once transformed, they cannot by any known magic be transitioned back to being as they were before being changed!<br />
<br />
Your brother is now and I imagine by your attitude, he is becoming a large breed buck goat, correct?<br />
<br />
I then feel it is for his delight and your gaining an understanding of what happens when a person his transformed, that you need to lose your virginity to a male goat. So you and Dan I shall transport to a goat farm not far away, and there, he shall force you to accept what you made of him to like, as prefer to do.&quot; An angry mother said to a willful daughter and doomed son and brother being a horny male goat.</p>
