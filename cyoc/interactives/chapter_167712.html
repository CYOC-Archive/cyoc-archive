<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Chronivac would arrive for young Danny Yang while he was quite busy elsewhere, though he would come back to quite a surprise. Presently, the young man was at the gym for yet another two and a half hour long workout. Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Yang was gritting his teeth as he curled 150 lbs at the very height of his bicep phase of the workout, his lightly permed black hair in a mess of sweat and exertion, almond colored eyes almost clenched shut from the strain of the workout. He was clad in a white tank top and gym shorts, both selected for the express purpose of making him look bigger and show off more of his physique.<br />
<br />
And what a physique it was. Easily more muscular than most of the jocks at his high school, Danny Yang was turning the corner from merely jock level physique into the kinds of appearances the physique bodybuilders / &quot;aesthetic bros&quot; he followed on instagram possessed. A cocky grin tugged at his face as he flexed his arms at the height of his exercise.<br />
<br />
The younger son of a pair of Chinese immigrants, Danny was about 18 and at the peak of his high school life. Whereas his older brother Jin tried to focus on classes, making himself successful and moving forward to a profitable trade school, Danny had thrown himself full force into a new lifestyle. As far as Danny was concerned, his brother was feeding into those old schooled &quot;Asian and Nerdy&quot; stereotypes. Danny&#39;s dad didn&#39;t really approve of it, but he recognized his son had the freedom to live as he chose. Just as long as he had a plan going forward.<br />
<br />
Danny for his part went the direction of joining in on the social aspect of high school. It was amazing how a jacked, muscular physique brings you up in the world of shallow appearance based high school politics.<br />
<br />
Danny finished his bicep curl with a grunt and shouted, &quot;Aww fuck! Fucking damn! Fifteen! Whew!&quot; He waved his arms to deal with the ache and flexed em for the mirror as he grinned at what he saw. Everyone had expected him to be like his brother...and he&#39;d hated it. So he consciously went the other direction. He thumped his chest once and felt the granite like feel of his pecs. A touch lower and he felt his abs, tight and toned abs that he loved showing off. Girls loved em too, which was always a plus.<br />
<br />
Funny how American girls loved a guy with abs so much. His last girlfriend couldn&#39;t even keep her hands off of &#39;em!<br />
<br />
His back was he guessed his one weakspot, less tone and width there, but even then he had a broader, stronger back than most of the other guys at high school. He stopped his flexing and went on to complete his workout. Going over to the bench and picking up some weights to rack on the bar, Danny set himself up to do some barbell shoulder presses. The first few were always kind of rough, but as they went on, he swore he almost felt high from how wonderful it felt to work his muscles.<br />
<br />
Before long he got his 4 x 10 done, and almost wanted to go and do 5 x 10, he knew he could do it...but his trainer was adamant that he do the exact routine the way it was outlined.<br />
<br />
By the time Danny was done with his workout, he felt sore all over, but the pump from his workout was making his muscles look even bigger than they had prior to getting to the gym. He was so fortunate to have such a large, generous gym with such a low price tag just down the street from his family&#39;s home.<br />
<br />
He snapped a few shirtless photos for his Instagram, and then got himself showered, dressed in his street clothes - a jacket, t-shirt, and jeans -  and started to head out. The first comments were coming in as he listened to some fresh EDM on his way home. Everyone got thirsty for him, and he loved it...well, then there was his brother saying he had better be putting in just as much effort on his school project. Danny rolled his eyes and typed in a &quot;sure sure bro whatevs.&quot;<br />
<br />
He had three weeks to get that project done. This Asian Adonis could spend at least a little of that time on the fun stuff. Like workouts, getting laid, and enjoying his status with the students at the school.<br />
<br />
As Danny got home, after of course spending a good amount of time ogling his reflection in mirrors and windows along the way, he walked by his dad - who seemed to be looking over some papers. Dad was almost typically strict, though he seemed to be getting less high strung in recent years. He was not quite as tall as Danny, 6 foot to Danny&#39;s 6 foot 2 inches, and he was stocky rather than muscular in the same way as Danny.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know son, your brother confided in me about how he worries about your participation at school...and the attitude you have at school...&quot; The old man breathed and sighed a long sigh after looking away, &quot;You know how much trouble your older brother had with the more prejudiced students there, and you must realize how it looks to him that you&#39;re palling around with the same sorts of people...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah, I know. I&#39;m not compromising my dignity or &quot;being a dancing bear&quot; for them. I&#39;m just having fun being, you know, actually popular.&quot; Danny responded. He admitted he did know a few people who hadn&#39;t exactly treated his brother well, yet they treated him like they were all just buddy buddy. Well, you don&#39;t become Prom King without breaking a few eggs, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don&#39;t want you to get burned by them. You know that their loyalties are about as steady as an eel&#39;s, correct?&quot; His dad did have admittedly a good point. Though Danny liked to believe he was popular enough to not merit such a backstab, he wasn&#39;t entirely immune to the fact that, well, this is high school. Petty could be the name of the game sometimes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah dad, I&#39;ll...keep that in mind.&quot; Danny headed off to his room, but then turned and caught something his dad tossed his way.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got that in the mail. Did you order anything on Amazon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No dad, I...confess I don&#39;t know where this thing came from.&quot; Danny took it in one hand and then walked over to his room. He had a computer - mostly for schoolwork - in the corner connected to a printer, and a laptop on his bed for his more private pursuits. Danny peeled open the box he got after locking the door to his room, and then bit his lip lightly when he saw what was inside.<br />
<br />
Looked like some kind of disc of some kind, marked &quot;Chronivac v.6.0&quot;, and it came with some kind of user&#39;s manual. Danny tilted his head a little bit and then started reading. And what he read almost made him either break out laughing or blanch at the implications from what this thing purported it could do. He actually paused a few times to take in everything he saw on the pages. &quot;Mother of fuck, this thing is magic if it&#39;s not bullshitting me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny grinned a little at the idea. He could be buffer than Jeff Seid and have all the girls in school lapping at his dick by the end of the day if he played his cards right. Just the thought started boning him up a bit...<br />
<br />
Then he was distracted by a text message coming in, from his girlfriend Sasha. She was a year older than him and was getting ready for college. She as usual cut right to the chase of the issue [show me that nekkid bod, Chinaboy]. He wished she wouldn&#39;t use that kind of &quot;ironic&quot; language when soliciting his nudes - he&#39;d be just fine sending them to her without the...uncomfortable language. It brought back up his dad&#39;s words and made it more difficult for him to get into this.<br />
<br />
Eh, he figured he could talk with her about it some time and deal. Off went his clothes, one after another, and he gave a cocky, charming smirk as he cupped his 8 incher with his hand and took his picture.<br />
<br />
[You make me so wet, Danny!!!]<br />
[We have got to fuck tonight!]<br />
[Come over to my place, we&#39;re gonna wake up the neighbors tonight!]<br />
<br />
Danny paused, and contemplated. He remembered his brother&#39;s issues and what his dad always told him, and once again it was difficult for him to just shrug it off. Why did these people think it didn&#39;t bother him? And why did it seem like even after he was bigger and more masculine than most of the jocks...that for some people in and out of his family he just wouldn&#39;t fit in with the new world he loved so much?<br />
<br />
Danny looked at the Chronivac disc, and then over at his computer, contemplating if it would be wise to give this alleged magical transformation disc a shot. Well, even if it didn&#39;t work it&#39;d probably get his mind off of this contemplative nonsense. After loading his computer and getting his disc in, he was surprised by a flash of light and then a grid of blue squares forming as the Chronivac logo displayed. He was left wondering what the deal was with this thing...<br />
<br />
...Then he saw it. His naked photo in the computer, and while he&#39;d usually be a little weirded out, he did admit it was kind of impressive. &quot;Wow, I dunno how it got that, but it really got all of my best qualities. Like my pecs, my huge biceps, and my dick.&quot; He grinned and started clicking through options. It seemed if this thing was for reals, it could probably change just about everything about someone. And what was more, it could even apparently load other peoples&#39; &quot;data&quot; to change them too!<br />
<br />
Danny thought back to his girlfriend&#39;s insensitive remarks, his dad&#39;s caution and his brother&#39;s experiences... Maybe there was something he could do here to see about his experiences and try and change em up a bit.</p>
