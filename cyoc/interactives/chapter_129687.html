<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom unconsciously crossed his legs when, of all the thoughts, his mind drifted to his golden lab Harvey and his heart skipped a beat.  Lowering his head, Kate could see the boy&#39;s ears starting to shift to a point before reshaping to something more canine.  A ringing in those new ears proceeded as the moved up his skull.  It was all the more for Tom to manage as it felt like someone had taken him by the nostrils and was tugging out his face, gradually, until subsiding.  He was left with a small muzzle, the beginnings of a dark nose, slightly furry ears and all seven inches of his cock hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a dog, you met him Matt, Harvey,&quot; Tom said faintly, lifting his head to reveal the changed face.  He winced and reached for his backside where, bulging and wiggling just above his ass was what he knew would be his tail.  &quot;He was a pretty big lab.  Friendly.  Never got him fixed,&quot; he added just as he felt his testicles squeeze hard, to the point of Tom having to shut his eyes, every drop of seed.  It came out watery and without any orgasm and to Tom&#39;s sighing, though still scared, mind his testicles pumped themselves smaller until he could barely feel anything but an empty sack between his legs.<br />
<br />
Tom felt the bulge at the front, while hard as ever, dwindle while the one at the back was struggling to get out.  Kate, however, was just transfixed on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dog?  Lab?  That&#39;s fair I guess.  I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t have trouble finding and mounting any bitches.  My uncle runs a puppy mill of sorts and, while usually looking for bitches, another stud can&#39;t hurt,&quot; Kate tittered, pulling out her phone to call her uncle.<br />
<br />
Looking down at his hands, the digits looking swollen, and stubby, and the nails darker, his thumbs shrinking back up his wrist, Tom decided to slid them down to his pj pants and tug down at the waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not mounting bitches,&quot; he said, the pants hitting his ankles just before his knees and padded palms followed suit.  &quot;I always had d-dreams about Harvey finding me... not me though but his b-b-bitch...&quot; Tom struggled before wincing his eyes shuts as his hips cracked and ass spread, his still growing doggy cunt hit with the warm air coming off his slimming frame.  Matt could only stare, transfixed on his transforming friend and his rapid decent into dark fantasy.  <br />
<br />
Tom felt another surge in his jaw and while opening, he took his hand- which was far more paw now- and ripped down at his shirt to get air against his hot chest. Kate knelt down and tugged the shreds off and whistled in admiration for the twelve nipples sprouting from his chocolate fur budding skin, which looked tight over his still changing bone and musculature .<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure what there is to be said about someone with dreams like that,&quot; Kate observed while watching the last prick of Tom&#39;s manhood get sucked into the growing swell of a sex going into heat.  &quot;Guess it doesn&#39;t matter since once you&#39;re done, you&#39;ll be in practical bliss.&quot;  She shook her head and Tom quivered, the internal changes finalizing to his new gender followed by more still muzzle growth, followed by his tongue and new teeth changing to match.  Tom&#39;s tail wagged as he watched his muzzle, now growing whiskers and coming in with its own fur to match the brown coat he had.<br />
<br />
Kate took off Tom&#39;s glasses which had only just hung on this long, tossing them aside before rubbing Tom&#39;s barely still human head.<br />
<br />
&quot;R-I-I wrant... priuppies...&quot; Tom struggled to say, looking up with still human eyes to Kate.  Those eyes suddenly went wide when a scrambling force bumped up against Tom from the rear.  Both he and Kate looked back, both shocked.<br />
<br />
Matt, his nails dark and face partially muzzle as well, was trying to grip and keep still a still diminishing Tom while Matt&#39;s lower half was almost completely male lab, complete with tail, haunches, paws, and bulging red cock and fur sheath.  His gut bulging somewhat and sheath dangling along with heavy balls, Tom would have blushed but instead felt his fur prickle and tail prick up.  Lowering his head back down, Tom felt the prodding of Matt&#39;s eager doggy dick and tried to steady his back legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-arrrvey,&quot; Tom managed as his last human words, the whine of Matt&#39;s changing lungs reminding Tom of his old companion in a way he hadn&#39;t thought about in years.  <br />
<br />
&#39;You always wondered how it would be, under Harvey, his paws grasping at your ribs.  Your heart racing,&#39; the voice in Tom&#39;s head said to him.  Matt&#39;s arms, while losing dexterity, length, and thumbs, were built for the task at hand and with the physical changes slowing to their finish on Tom, Matt had the bitch secure under him.  Then he found his mark.  &#39;You&#39;re about to be fucked by your dog.  Probably get pregnant too.  What would your parents say if they saw,&#39; and the voice paused when the first few millimeters forced themselves in before the first solid inch was into him.  &#39;Saw their boy, taking doggy dick, then waddling around while a litter grew in him?  Or her, rather.&#39;<br />
<br />
The words were mostly lost as Tom shut his eyes and whimpered, Matt&#39;s cock driving in further until buried to the hilt.  When his eyes opened, they were simply canine brown and Tom was physically submissive in every way to the stud on top.<br />
<br />
For Matt&#39;s part, once Tom mentioned Harvey, he knew he was doomed.  Having met the dog, his memory was vivid and far more dominant.  As Tom was falling to the ground, revealing his new cunt, Matt felt his swollen balls churning with canine seed as a furry velvet coated it and started taking his cock into a sheath.<br />
<br />
By the time he jumped Tom, his mind was dead set on delivering every drop into Tom&#39;s fertile cunt as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
&#39;You feel that?  You&#39;ve always wanted to know so, that feeling is what a doggy knot swelling up is,&#39; the voice said as Tom soon felt.  &#39;He won&#39;t be much longer.  I bet you&#39;ll really swell up before you pop.  Enjoy your new life, bitch!&#39; the voice said in parting.  Not a second after, Matt&#39;s spasms ended with a shake and the unnatural but intoxicating sensation of being filled washed over Tom. Legs shaking, he moaned and whimper in what he quickly realized was an orgasm, a lab bitch orgasm.<br />
<br />
Both dogs fell over panting, stuck together in what both were realizing, as the sexual haze came down and their minds returned to some odd instinct dueled diminished mental capacity, what they are really gotten themselves into.  Looking up, they saw Kate hanging up her phone at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle is on his way with a big cage for you two, filthy animals.  Enjoy that new life,&quot; she said before closing the door.<br />
<br />
Both dogs whimpered and looked at each other.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh shit, this is really happening,&#39; Tom thought to himself, moving slightly only to feel the knot still firmly in him, though, not enough to stop some cum leaking down his leg.<br />
<br />
&#39;No shit it is,&#39; Matt thought before it dawned on them both.  <br />
<br />
&#39;You can hear me?&#39; Tom asked, trying not to move lest he agitate their position. <br />
<br />
&#39;And you can hear me?  Dude, why did I just lose my virginity to a dog?&#39; Matt asked, lifting his hind leg to try and fathom the point of view of his dick bent back in his friend&#39;s cunt.<br />
<br />
Tom whimpered and looked up at his dorm room door, from where all this misery came not 15 minutes before.  &#39;You think that&#39;s bad, I&#39;m having your puppies,&#39; he lamented as a warmth came from his groin.</p>
