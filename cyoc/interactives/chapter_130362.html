<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Much of the day for Elizabeth Harper after the visit to Aredale & Sons and to discuss the legal issues that related to John and Janice&#39;s &quot;emancipation&quot; with the firm&#39;s female attorney, Aberdeen. It had represented a lot of the potential difficulties that went along with sending John and Janice to be with Jenny and her husband, particularly in relation to where their father James Sr. might not agree to it and the bigger issue would be that the Harpers lived in a different state. Aberdeen had said that a &quot;preliminary arrangement&quot; could be made in the short term, but they would ultimately need formal paperwork from an Alabama law firm that essentially carried the agreement to hand over custody in agreement to the documents that Aberdeen had drawn up while they were there.<br />
<br />
However, while Jenny would have wished to handle a lot of these signatures as quickly as possible, by this time she had to return to the college campus for her classes, as did Harry. Elizabeth was fine with that, as she knew the hospital had lengthy visiting hours and with her new found independence she felt she could talk her husband into agree to it. A part of her wanted James Jr. and Jenny there for her own comfort and security, at least while they were in Moon Lake, and in that she agreed to wait until Jenny finished her last class for the day or had a long enough break in her schedule to go over to the hospital. This left Elizabeth spending some time touring the college campus going  over some of the things that James Sr. didn&#39;t do when he&#39;d brought Jenny to Moon Lake and had no intention as part of his plan to defend Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s claim on Jenny. James Junior went with Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
Things were rather interesting though there was a lot that Elizabeth was surprised by. While there were some people at the campus that were built the way she had been or the way most people that she knew had been, most were built the way Jenny was now or the way her husband was built. There were differences, as some were clearly stronger looking than others and some were clearly bigger in some areas than others, which was odd and surprising in many ways. Elizabeth fit into a C cup bra, but that had also been after four pregnancies that were rapid succession, before that, she&#39;d been built much like Jenny had been built, barely filling an A cup. Yet the smallest size most of the women in Moon Lake seemed to be in the D range, and a few seemed to go WELL beyond that. And while she tried to be discreet, Elizabeth also got the sensation that the smallest size for Moon Lake&#39;s men was likely considered large elsewhere in the country.<br />
<br />
But things seemed rather friendly, Elizabeth supposed she couldn&#39;t get too hung up on people&#39;s looks. The people seemed friendly enough, and in that Elizabeth found that to be good for Jenny, which she was set to inform Jenny on as they met for lunch in the school&#39;s cafeteria.<br />
<br />
&quot;The people here seem to be rather friendly,&quot; Elizabeth said to Jenny as they sat down in the cafeteria, &quot;distant on some things... but I suppose after... after what your father and his boss put this town through, I suppose they&#39;re a bit on edge and don&#39;t want to deal with me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny watched as her mother lowered her head as she finished that. Her father and Dieter Wilhelm probably were a big part of some things that Moon Lake&#39;s people might be on edge over, but the big thing was more the were secret. While Jenny had found that while weres were all well built and fit what people defined as the various forms for physical beauty to perfection, there was also worries over prejudices and medieval &quot;were hunts&quot; that they wanted to avoid. Even if Elizabeth Harper hadn&#39;t been connected, if indirectly, to a greedy businessmen who was willing to kill people, as someone outside Moon Lake, a lot of the people of Moon Lake, be they were or normal, would be hesitant on that issue. Jenny had told John and Janice, as if she was to look after her younger siblings, they&#39;d NEED to know, so as not to be frightened or startled by anything, and she told James Junior because she trusted her older brother to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t just be you,&quot; Harry assured her, &quot;we had some unwanted excitement going on before the wedding to... something about a woman not liking that a man said &quot;no&quot; to her... but that was resolved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not common, though, right?&quot; James Jr. asked.<br />
<br />
Harry nodded, &quot;It isn&#39;t... it&#39;s why a lot of people in Moon Lake may be on edge when it does happen because it is so rare. Though, I&#39;d think in time that will ease out...&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth and James Jr. both nodded at this as they proceeded to eat their lunch. It wasn&#39;t super fancy, but it was a step up from what Elizabeth remembered when she went through school. It was something that gave her some private assurance that Jenny would be safe and happy with Harry and that Janice and John would be looked after and in good hands. A part of her DID want to keep her children, but the Harper family had never been that well off. Some of it was the fact that Elizabeth had never practiced birth control, which had lead to her pregnancies with James Jr. and then Jenny,  then John, and finally Janice in rapid succession. By the time Janice was born, Elizabeth&#39;s workload as a mother was such that her &quot;love life&quot; lost its activity, but still had a lot of financial responsibilities. <br />
<br />
That was complicated by the fact that James Senior had never gotten beyond a very basic education and could only hold down a job as a lineman for the power company that Dieter Wilhelm owned and ran. He&#39;d done okay, but Dieter never paid him much beyond minimum wage, despite the fact that James Sr. had been the company&#39;s hardest and most loyal worker, which meant that his earnings weren&#39;t that great. When that was combined with the fact that James Senior had also kept Elizabeth out of the things she&#39;d wanted to do, which had included even working with a couple of sewing and fabric stores, had meant that the only income the Harpers had was what James Senior earned. It had meant that James Junior, despite good grades couldn&#39;t get into anything better than a community college for financial reasons and the only reason Jenny had gotten into Moon Lake College had been the fact that she&#39;d actually done better in High School than James Jr. had and earned a scholarship for that alone. From their report cards, John and Janice weren&#39;t doing too bad, but prior to what the present financial issues that would relate to James Senior&#39;s heart attack, Elizabeth couldn&#39;t be sure on whether or not they would have had the money to put John and Janice through college too.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Elizabeth said slowly, &quot;as there will be a lot to do...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny and Harry both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our afternoon schedule is pretty open immediately after lunch,&quot; Harry said slowly, &quot;we do have some afternoon classes... but we would have the time to take you over to the hospital to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sign over my children,&quot; Elizabeth finished with a sigh. There was some depression in her voice and her eyes were downcast, as this did represent the troubles that James Senior had put the Harper family in and what she&#39;d let him put the family in. A part of her mind wondered why she&#39;d never thought to confront him earlier on the issues that they&#39;d been in. Perhaps if she&#39;d stood up for herself she could have gotten her work at that sewing store she&#39;d had an interest in back around the time that she married James Senior. Sure, she wouldn&#39;t have earned too much, but it certainly would have helped the Harper family finances and it might have forced her husband to recognize certain things instead of taking discipline to the point where it could be classified as abuse and forcing Jenny to want to leave Alabama and never return and forcing her eldest son to actively try to shield his siblings from their father. She eventually looked up to Jenny and Harry, &quot;Please do better with Janice and John than I did...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll be well looked after, mom,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;and it isn&#39;t like any of this is being blamed on you... or even dad, though he probably deserves it... and it isn&#39;t like we would want to deny you the right to know how Janice and John are doing. In a way... if things work well, visits would be welcome...&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth gave her eldest daughter an apologetic smile, &quot;you and I both know your father will be too difficult to make that a comfortable visit. I think I can get him to behave himself... at least reasonably... but that isn&#39;t going to mean that he would be pleasant company... And even getting him to be reasonable won&#39;t be easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny reached across the table and James Junior looked to her with a look of knowing understanding. James had been trying to find ways to get his father to turn the corner for years, particularly as he went through high school and started college himself as he began to understand more about the world, but more often not about all he&#39;d managed was some small concession here or there. It&#39;d never been enough really get James Sr. to improve his behavior. However, while things wouldn&#39;t be easy, that didn&#39;t mean that Jenny or James Jr. were going to not abandon their family. James Sr. was difficult and a real part of the problem, but he was now in a position where he really wasn&#39;t a threat to anyone, and Elizabeth had seemed to have regained her free will. They&#39;d do what they could to help their mother, for Jenny, that&#39;d be looking after Janice and John. For James Junior, for a while at least, that&#39;d include helping his mother get the Harper family finances in order and seeing to it that Elizabeth kept her willingness to stand up for herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we will need to go pretty quickly after lunch,&quot; Harry said to remind the group.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
They arrived at the hospital to find Doctor Tora Tachibana making his rounds as they came up to the front desk in the hospital&#39;s cardiac ward. He looked calmly to Jenny and Harry and then to Elizabeth and James Junior as they came closer. Jenny noted a frustrated frown, which she guessed meant that her father had remained as difficult as ever. That could well mean that things wouldn&#39;t be easy, but Jenny had had some sensation of that things wouldn&#39;t be easy even before things began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid he isn&#39;t in too great a mood,&quot; Doctor Tachibana said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s probably to be expected, sir,&quot; James Junior spoke with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he conscious?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is... but he isn&#39;t a good mood,&quot; Doctor Tachibana spoke, &quot;Some of it is from the realization that we gave him the angioplasty last night...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will allow him to go home, right?&quot; Elizabeth asked, &quot;before dealing with anything that relate to this replacement heart valve that you mentioned?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he would be safe to transfer,&quot; Doctor Tachibana nodded, &quot;the insurance company still wants a second opinion from Alabama before dealing with a replacement heart valve... but I&#39;d think he&#39;d be safe to move...&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth looked James Junior and then asked, &quot;we&#39;ll need to look into the cardiologists to send him to... though... I... I don&#39;t know for certain how well they&#39;d be equipped. We might have to take him to Birmingham for the surgery.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Tachibana nodded, &quot;You may have to go through some formalities and references... The insurance company doesn&#39;t exactly trust my diagnosis... probably because Washington State is well beyond what they would expect with regard to diagnosis. As such, they want confirmation from local physicians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see to it,&quot; Elizabeth assured him, &quot;though at present, the big thing will be to handle some affairs that will be better for everyone...&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Tachibana watched as Elizabeth pulled out a folded set of papers from her purse. On one page he noticed a legal seal that had essentially raised that part of the paper. He could remember some of the rantings that James Senior that had amounted to disowning even Jenny and James Junior, both of who were over eighteen and in pure theory could go their own way regardless of what James Senior thought. A part of him wondered if Elizabeth Harper, who he had tried to reason with, but had remained rather supportive of all the problems that James Senior ranted at had gone through with some of that.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are some papers that a Miss Aberdeen said would be Moon Lake&#39;s allowance for Jenny and Harry to look after her younger siblings where they will be safe,&quot; Elizabeth spoke, &quot;she said he&#39;d need to sign it to before signing similar agreements in Alabama... and if not...  there&#39;d be trouble in dealing with lawsuits... and with the recent medical issues, neither James Sr. nor I can afford. Jenny and Harry can give John and Janice more than what I could offer. She said there&#39;d need to be a witness... could you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aredale, Aberdeen?&quot; Doctor Tachibana asked, slipping into the more formal reference that had been part of Japanese culture.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, her first name is Aberdeen,&quot; Elizabeth corrected, &quot;Aredale is her last name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Doctor Tachibana answered raising one hand, &quot;though it is typical in Japanese culture to refer to the family name first... Especially in formal situations. I didn&#39;t expect you to refer to her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been part of some efforts to get things in order,&quot; Jenny spoke up, &quot;Harry and I want to look after my younger siblings... give them a safe...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;re right to do so,&quot; Elizabeth added weakly, &quot;James Senior will need a lot of medical care that will be tough to pay for... and... and given his difficulty, it may be smarter to keep the younger ones here where they won&#39;t fall under his anger... And James Junior and I may try to either set their father right or at least try to reduce the problems he can cause...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Doctor Tachibana said slowly. He was surprised by this as it seemed to be more in line with what he&#39;d been trying to convince her into accepting earlier and hadn&#39;t had success. Yet, something had changed, but he couldn&#39;t say what it was. &quot;Well... I suppose I can manage as a witness. We also have a few forms for financial assistance, if you&#39;d care to fill them out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting James Senior to sign first,&quot; Elizabeth spoke, &quot;then James Junior and I can stick around to go through your paperwork.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Tachibana nodded and then stepped back to usher them along and lead them through the halls until they came to one of the rooms where they found James Senior laying in the bed. He was still in a medical gown with a blanket that was pulled up to his chest, though his arms lay over the blankets. From there, Elizabeth could see the various tubes and things that James Senior had been hooked up to. He was conscious and his face soured as he noticed Jenny and James Junior coming in behind Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to see rebels,&quot; James Senior grumbled with narrowed eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not in much position to demand ANYTHING, dear,&quot; Elizabeth managed after a moment, and with a firmness that she&#39;d never thought she&#39;d muster against James Senior, &quot;You&#39;ve had a heart attack that&#39;s proven to be quite complicated... your employer has been legally proven to be a jerk to the point of sending people to try and kill people here in this town... and it&#39;s going to be quite some time before you&#39;re able to do much for the foreseeable future.&quot;<br />
<br />
James Senior blinked with some surprise, but didn&#39;t say anything. It was like he was totally dumbfounded that Elizabeth would be confrontational with him. James Junior did that from time to time, often when trying to suggest things that children were not to make to parents and essentially urged him to let chaos reign, but he&#39;d never expected anything like that from Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we will have a lot of bills to pay that will cost a lot of money and money you can&#39;t earn anymore,&quot; Elizabeth spoke, &quot;the power company should have a pension plan for you... but that won&#39;t be enough to cover the bills here and the bills that will be incurred in Alabama if the doctors there agree that you need to have a heart valve replaced.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re taking some Yellow&#39;s side?!&quot; James Senior blurted.<br />
<br />
&quot;His race is not why you collapsed in pain in a church clutching at your chest,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;and he could well be right. And if that saves your life, you owe him. His race wouldn&#39;t matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
James Senior glared from Elizabeth to Jenny and then his eldest son, figuring this had to be their doing, but for the moment he couldn&#39;t pinpoint it. At the same time, while he was angry, he had to privately admit that he also felt too physically weak to do anything. He was privately worried about his future, as he didn&#39;t feel he was strong enough to keep working as a lineman. If Dieter Wilhelm were still free, he might earn a promotion to an office position, but he remembered seeing his employer lead out of the church in handcuffs with the local police looking quite triumphant, and their accusation of supposedly sending assassins was shocking. A good part of him didn&#39;t believe it, but he had no way to prove it.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, there is a lot that we have to set right,&quot; Elizabeth spoke, &quot;especially for Janice and John...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said...&quot; James Senior began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Disowning all of them?&quot; Elizabeth cut him off, &quot;Dear, I know you&#39;re mad that Mr. Wilhelm lead you by the nose for years and that Jenny fell in love with someone other than him... But SHE has the right to be happy. And she at least made the choice, and the man she chose hasn&#39;t tried to kill people...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You...&quot; James Senior began.<br />
<br />
&quot;And where is disowning them going to make ANYTHING better?&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;Jenny is nearly NINETEEN. James Junior is over twenty. They&#39;re both legal adults. They&#39;ve found people they love and want to have their own families with. Disowning them won&#39;t change anything but take family from us... and it certainly wouldn&#39;t control them. And John and Janice... how is punishing them for things James Junior and Jenny have done rational? How is that right!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woman!&quot; James Senior began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Invalid,&quot; Elizabeth growled back which surprised everyone, though no one said anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re a good man and that deep down you&#39;ve wanted to do the right thing,&quot; Elizabeth said after a moment and a deep breath, &quot;but punishing Janice and John for Jenny being happy is not right. Disowning your children for them being happy is not right and it won&#39;t change the fact that we will have a LOT of medical bills to pay... and potentially a few legal ones to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;d be no legal bills if you don&#39;t go through with what I told you!&quot; James Senior said weakly, still surprised at his wife&#39;s standing up to him and by her pointing out his condition. A part of him was also puzzled some of her words. If a woman were being so confrontational, it&#39;d have to mean she didn&#39;t love the man, but then a woman who didn&#39;t love her husband wouldn&#39;t say, &quot;I know you&#39;re a good man...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The legal bills will relate to doing what will be best for the family,&quot; Elizabeth spoke, &quot;You&#39;re going to need a lot of help that you can&#39;t do on your own. Your pension won&#39;t cover your bills. We&#39;ll be looking to move into a smaller apartment once you&#39;ve gotten through all the hospital stays that you&#39;ll need, which will be more cost effective and will be easier for you to get in and out of. I will be looking to see if any local sewing store might want an extra checker or stock woman... And we will transfer the custody of Janice and John to Jenny and her husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Out of the question!&quot; James Sr. answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that IS what we&#39;re doing,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;it&#39;d save money for us, to cover your medical bills, the legal bills for the consultations and paperwork, the move to a cheaper apartment, and getting everything else in order... And it would be cheaper than trying to disown them, which could well end up in court that would cost more money. So which do you prefer? Court dates that could well see you charged with a crime or being at fault? Or a consultation fee that will at least leave you with some ability to at least claim you have a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
James Senior didn&#39;t answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;d have the medical bills regardless,&quot; Elizabeth spoke, &quot;James Junior, Jennifer Harper-Jenkins, John, and Janice didn&#39;t cause you to have a heart attack and we can&#39;t change that. And to do what is best for Janice and John... and ultimately what is best for us... we&#39;re both going to have to make some changes. Changes due to what you can do physically now... and changes due to the financial abilities that we&#39;ve been left with.&quot;<br />
<br />
James Senior didn&#39;t answer, and looked down. Eventually he sighed and nodded. He wasn&#39;t an easy man to get along with, and there was plenty that some people found him to be wrong about, but regardless on specific opinions on Elizabeth&#39;s present actions, which he found surprising, he did love her deep down. He&#39;d had a couple of girlfriends before Elizabeth, one left him on a date and the other slapped him at her front door and the date never happened. In that, by staying with him for as long as she did, a part of him loved Elizabeth dearly for that... even if he&#39;d never admit that openly to anyone, even Elizabeth. And for the moment, what she had said did strike a certain tone that he couldn&#39;t argue with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; James Senior said slowly and with a very defeated tone in his voice. He didn&#39;t like the idea of being defeated, but he knew there&#39;d be medical bills to pay and in that he didn&#39;t have much choice. He signed the papers where he was directed to and then watched as the Japanese doctor then signed on the witness line. He knew that he&#39;d probably have to sign similar papers once they got to Alabama to formalize everything, but he also knew that he likely wouldn&#39;t have the funds to easily pay for the medical bills. A courtroom fight over custody and/or disowning his children would only be more expensive. He didn&#39;t like it, but he knew he was beaten.</p>
