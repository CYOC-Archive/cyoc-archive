<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You walk along the trail, trying to stay on the path but as you go deeper into the forest the trail becomes harder and harder to follow. You move between the large trees, the path little more than an animal path through the every darkening forest.  You have the feeling you should turn back, and turn around only to become unsure of which direction you actually came from, the path being undistiguishable from the rest of the ground in the slowly fading light of coming evening.  Even the mystical creatures you saw wandering the woods seem conspicuously absent.  In a moment of panic you begin to cry out for help, hoping someone anyone can hear you.  You hang your head, cursing yourself for an idiot, but only for a moment before you feel a sharp pain on the back of your head and everything goes black.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
What you first become aware of when your conciousness returns is the steady pounding throbbing in the back of your skull.  A pain that mostly overwhelms a stiff feeling in your arms, which feel as if they are supporting your whole weight, something clasped around your wrist keeping you from collapsing in a heap on the ground.  You finally work up the courage to open your eyes, your vision swirling and dancing for a few moments before you finally come back to your senses.<br />
<br />
You appear to be inside a cave, a cave someone or something is living in.  Furs are spread around on the ground for sitting, and one over a stack of leaves could easily serve as a bed.  A blazing fire burns in the center of the cave, casting harsh shadows on the walls.  You dangle helplessly from a pair of chains somehow fastened to the ceiling, your feet barely touching the floor.<br />
<br />
Then there's the smell.  The cave reeks.  The normal smell of musty dampness is mixed with something else your mind identifies as locker room.  The heavy musk of unwashed male body and sweat permeates the entire cave.  On one hand you want to gag, on the other it makes you almost giddily dizzy.  You open your mouth to speak, but all that comes out is a hoarse croak.  You lick your lips, trying to work up some moisture in your mouth to try again.  Just as you're about to call out you see a large figure step into the fire light from further in the cave, or perhaps from the cave entrance, from where you are there's no way to tell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awake?&quot;  The voice you hear is deep and gruff, gravely.  The figure steps closer into the firelight, and what you could have mistaken for a very large man when he stood in the shadows is revealed as anything but human.  The first thing you notice is his skin, it's dark green.  His body is muscle-bound, almost every movement sending ripples off under that thick green skin.  Shaggy black hair frames an almost bestial face, his nose is flat and broad, slightly upturned, his brow is low and his eyes deep set.  A thick grey metal ring pierces his nose like a bull's.  His jaw is heavy and square, and from behind his bottom lip two tusks stick out of his mouth.  He has thick black stubble all along his jaws a cheeks, though it has been allowed to grow longer on his chin, a six inch brain hanging down.<br />
<br />
He only wears a bit of clothing.  A leather vest that does little to hide his bulging chest, or the thick mat of curly black hair covering his pecs, or his hairy arms.  He wears a leather loincloth, at least keeping some modesty, but his muscles aren't the only bulges that are difficult to hide.  A pair of leather boots tugged over his huge feet finishes off the outfit.<br />
<br />
Your eyes go wide as you watch the creature come closer, finally you manage to croak out a few raspy words.  &quot;Who.. what..&quot;<br />
<br />
The creature tilts his head as he looks at you.  He doesn't respond, instead he walks over to a barrel you hadn't noticed, and pulls out a ladel.  He brings it over to you, the smell of slightly stagnant water wafting up towards your nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drink.&quot;  You clench your jaw shut.  Better thirsty than to risk that water.  The creature doesn't seem to take your refusal.  Thick fingered hands force your jaw open and pour the water forcibly down your throat.  You nearly gag, but the water doesn't taste nearly as bad as it smells.  Slightly musty, and a bit thick on the tongue but palatable.  You're offered no more though, as he tosses the ladel back towards the barrel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot;  With your mouth finally moistened you find your ability to speak again.<br />
<br />
For a while you think he's not going to answer you but finally he speaks.  &quot;I am Jozal the orc.  You are my prisoner now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prisoner?&quot;  You don't know why you're surprised, the chains should have made it obvious, but you are.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  You came in my territory, I caught you, you are my prisoner.  That is how it works.  The forest has rules.  That is one.&quot;  As your mind tries to process this Jozal wanders off a little distance towards a stack of tools, he picks one out and comes back over to you, the knife in his hand gleaming wickedly in the firelight.  You worry for a moment, but rather than using the knife on you, he begins to cut your clothes off, tossing the scraps of cloth aside.<br />
<br />
He steps back and looks at you once you are naked.  Looking at you much the same way you were looking at him a moment ago.  Like he wasn't quite sure what to make of your appearance.  You had to admit to yourself, it wasn't much.  As a college student who had to work full time you didn't get much of a chance to work on your body.  You aren't fat, but you do have a little bit of pudge on you.  Mainly, everyone you know has only ever really described you as average looking.  your body hair is sparse, and you're more than certain you couldn't grow a full beard if you tried.  The only thing you ever really had going for you was that at least you were on the tall side, 6'2&quot;.  Making the fact that Jozal was a head taller that you all that more worrisome.<br />
<br />
After his examination Jozal shakes his head, looking annoyed.  &quot;Needs work.&quot;  You can't help but blush at his remark, embarassed and more than a little annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could just let me go.&quot;  You give an experimental tug on one of the chains, making it rattle.<br />
<br />
Jozal just shakes his head.  &quot;No, I took you prisoner, now I must deal with you.  That is another rule.&quot;  You were already getting sick of his rules.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jozal doesn't favor you with an answer, merely shrugging.  He goes about his business, fixing his dinner on the fire, drinking water (from a seperate barrel than the one he gave you your drink from), and basically ignoring all questions that came his way.  Soon, despite the uncomfortable position you're in you begin to nod off.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
You're awoken with the Jozal's vise like grip on your jaw, forcing your mouth open to pour more water down your throat.  After a few sputtering sips he back away.  &quot;Food would be nice too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jozal just shakes his head.  &quot;No food.  You'll drink the grash'takal.  It has all you need.&quot;  So it wasn't water, that more than explained the smell.<br />
<br />
Soon you're being subjected to your next embarassment.  Jozal circles you, giving you an even closer examination than before.  He stops infront of you again.  Forcing you to open your mouth, he peers inside like a man thinking of buying a horse.  He holds your eyelids open with a calloused finger, peering into your eyes with his yellow ones.  He then reaches down and wraps his hand around your cock.  A cock which you somehow had not noticed stood completely erect.  He gives the shaft a small squeeze, then cups your balls.  Whatever he is doing, he must be satisfied because he just nods.  &quot;It is working.  It doesn't always, you are taking to it well.  That is good.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look down at your cock, trying to figure out why he's pleased.  Your eyes widen, something is definately off....</p>
