<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What’s your decision, Rose?” Lesley asked the woman on the hospital bed. Gloria strained to hear the answer, very curious what Rose would choose.<br />
<br />
“I choose to finish this with one last round, and I’m sending Dave in to try his luck.” Rose answered.<br />
<br />
Lesley smiled at the audience as she motioned Dave forward. “You heard her, folks. Today, a treat rarely seen on this stage, a father going for a spin on the Rebirth Roulette wheel he&#39;s spun before!”<br />
<br />
As Dave stood next to Rose’s hospital bed, his body rapidly shrank, just like his other children&#39;s had. And just like with Jessica, Lesley let him shrink down into an infant before lifting him out of his pile of clothing and holding the naked baby boy up to the audience.<br />
<br />
“First, the easy part. I’ve regressed his age, so now it’s time to spin the wheel and see what happens to him!”<br />
<br />
As Lesley finished speaking, Rose began to pant with exertion. Gloria strained her neck to watch as Lesley helped Rose become pregnant with her infant husband. After Rose’s labor pangs subsided, Lesley helped her up off the table, to show off her pregnant belly to the audience.<br />
<br />
“Now, for this last round, I’m going to let you have a good look at Rose’s pregnancy as she sends her husband back to his beginnings.” Lesley said, as a spotlight shone down on Rose’s belly.<br />
<br />
“Take it slowly, I want Dave to feel what he put our other two through.” Rose said.<br />
<br />
“Very well.” Lesley answered. “Let’s count backwards through the months, everyone. Where do we start?”<br />
<br />
“Nine!” came a cry from the audience.<br />
<br />
Lesley smiled as Rose’s belly shifted, the baby inside her rising up from the birthing position. Then Lesley gestured for the audience to keep going.<br />
<br />
“Eight!” Gloria found herself joining in the cry this time, and watched in fascination as Rose’s belly shrank. This continued through the months of pregnancy, with Rose’s belly shrinking more each month, until the cry of “One” left her with a completely flat-looking belly.<br />
<br />
“Now, let me get a sample jars ready before we finish this.” Lesley said, reaching into her sleeves and pulling out the same sort of jars she’d used with Kevin. “Rose, will we be keeping the same samples for each of them, or do you want to add a little risk and reuse Kevin&#39;s sample jar from earlier and risk some of Dave&#39;s swimmers from earlier mix with his?”<br />
<br />
Rose got a mischievous expression on her face as she spread her legs apart and squatted over the first sample jar. “Let’s see what happens if you reuse Kevin&#39;s jar.” She said.<br />
<br />
As soon as she finished saying that, Rose moaned in pleasure, this time letting the entire audience see her live out her baby’s conception. A moment later, sperm dribbled out from between her pussy lips, and Lesley caught it in the previously used jar.<br />
<br />
Moments later, the jar was full, and Lesley helped Rose back onto the hospital bed. This time, one of the assistants spread some sort of gel on Rose’s belly, and placed an electronic gadget against it. After a moment, a grainy black-and-white picture appeared projected on both sides of the stage.<br />
<br />
“I thought it would be fun to watch this last pregnancy in detail.” Lesley said, as she held up the sample jar and gave the contents a good swirl. “Now, let’s see how lucky Dave is.”<br />
<br />
Lesley held the jar between Rose’s legs, and she moaned in orgasm one more time as Dave was re-conceived. A moment later, a tiny dot appeared on the monitor.<br />
<br />
“And we have conceived! That’s one hurdle down, and nine months of development to go. Count with me again.” Lesley said, leading the crowd in a chant again.<br />
<br />
“One!” The dot on the image didn’t seem to change much.<br />
<br />
“Two!” The dot grew and lengthened, becoming comma-shaped.<br />
<br />
“Three!” The dots had a distinct head and body. Lesley was gesturing for the chant to continue.<br />
<br />
“Four!” Now there was clearly a baby in Rose.<br />
<br />
“Five!” “Six”<br />
<br />
After “Six”, Lesley stopped the chants and looked over at the monitor.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like we have a healthy baby boy developing in there, let&#39;s see what changes have come to Dave from this trip around the Rebirth Roulette Wheel.&quot;<br />
<br />
She waved her hands and Rose’s pregnancy progressed the rest of the way, and Rose began to groan with labor pains. After a moment, the baby emerged. Lesley waited patiently for a minute or two, as Rose’s labor ended. She then held up her crystal to Rose’s face, sending her into a deep trance.<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s find out what reusing Kevin&#39;s jar did to Dave,” Lesley said as the babe in her arms grew up once more.<br />
<br />
The baby grew into a child with dirty blonde hair and green eyes--far from the brown eyes and brown hair of Dave and Kevin. However like Kevin, and unlike Dave, the boy was giggly, energetic and certainly more athletic than Dave had been. Soon he&#39;d hit puberty and his dirty blond hair darkened to a light brown hair. His body hair grew to match his light brown head of hair which was cut fashionably and sparingly across his lean athletic build. Lesley paused here to ask the young man a few questions. <br />
<br />
“Welcome back! Please introduce yourself to the audience.” Lesley said to the young adult on her stage.<br />
<br />
“I’m Leofric--though I go by Leo mostly, and I’m studying to be an architect,” The man said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to be taking rather good care of yourself, from the look of things, Leo,&quot; said Lesley.<br />
<br />
&quot;A man&#39;s gotta take care of himself. We only have one body--best not mistreat it. It&#39;s a tool after all, and if you mistreat your tools, how can you expect to use them later?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sound opinion, but let&#39;s put that philosophy to the test, shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leo then began to grow older, his muscles and build at first increasing a bit as a bit of bulk emerged before it seemed to soften slightly--though not enough to cause Leo to lose his build completely, just enough to say that he might have other things on his mind. When he&#39;d returned to David&#39;s original age, Lesley stopped the aging, and immediately the audience could see that Leo had aged far better than David had, with only a bit of weathering, the loss of his abs (with only a flat stomach to see), and some graying at his temples, and what appeared to be reading glasses appearing on Leo. Overall he was still a rather impressive man that was bordering on DILF quality as far as the male attracted portion of the audience was concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leo, tell me about Rose, your wife and your four daughters?&quot; asked Lesley.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love them all, and wouldn&#39;t change a thing about them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even for say a prize?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a thing,&quot; emphasized Leo. Lesley nodded approvingly and directed him to one of her stage hands to help him get dressed as David&#39;s old clothes were clearly no longer going to fit him. She then called Rose forward on the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rose? Your thoughts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean to tell me that you can make it that I have been married to Leo all this time instead of David? Oh, sign me up.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Well, ladies and gentlemen, Rose has had pretty good luck with this spin. Her husband coming back having won the genetic lottery, having a better value of his family, and the patience and prudence to look after his health better this time around. But at the same time it looks like Dave’s luck ran out completely, since his sperm completely lost the race and was replaced with someone so completely different, even if better that he has almost little connection to who he was before. The only connecting being the meaning of his name--both David and Leofric meaning beloved--which Kevin also means as well, now that I recall. So while there&#39;s some distant connection with the name, it&#39;s not enough of a connection to say that Dave won this round himself, so I’m going to have to call that a loss for the family, and there won&#39;t be any additional prizes for this round.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all right, Leo, is prize enough,&quot; cooed Rose, which caused the audience and Lesley to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, with that, I think we conclude this round of Rebirth Roulette!&quot;</p>
