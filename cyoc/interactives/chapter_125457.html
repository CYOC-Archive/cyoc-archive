<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The flight back to Australia was calm and relatively quiet for Ben and Tyree. There were a few tourists that got on at LAX after their connection flight from Lyre/Animalia&#39;s small airport, and many of those tourists gave the pair of Thylacine Animalians a fair amount of attention, mostly because the Thylacine was an extinct animal and thus was very different. The pair shared what they could with those who were the most curious during the flight, but were more than happy to have a few moments to themselves, and once the plane landed at Sydney, they were left to their own devices, mostly as passengers went about collecting their bags and then disembarking. And both of them did the same, as they were ready to return home.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how many heads we&#39;ll turn once we get home,&quot; Tyree commented with a small smile, &quot;I mean... sure we&#39;ve all seen Animalians on the news and on their little web show... but this will be a first for Australia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More with the fact that we&#39;re Thylacines,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;the conservation groups will be especially happy to have us around as a &quot;restored&quot; species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the farmers and ranchers will be glad that as Animalians, we aren&#39;t going to prey on their sheep and chickens,&quot; Tyree commented, &quot;which was why they exterminated the Thylacine in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben nodded. Of course, human hunting wasn&#39;t the only reason for the Thylacine&#39;s decline. It may have been the main reason, but not the only one, and in mainland Australia there was some argument that the Dingo out competed the Thylacine in the respective niches that the Thylacine normally occupied. Though in the end that issue really didn&#39;t matter that much. The Thylacine had still been wiped out and it was only through Horizon and Animalia that Australia was able to get one of its iconic animals back. Though, for the most part the two of them were more concerned with their own wedding preparations than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think your Uncle will be able to come to the wedding?&quot; Tyree asked as they walked down the gangway from the plane carrying their bags.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ben gave a slow shrug, &quot;I actually would have thought that he would have settled down in the Amazon given the archeological dig they found and the fact that many research scientists wanting to study wildlife in the Amazon would need someone who&#39;s been fairly familiar with the environment... but I suppose this find in Egypt was enough to get him interested... but even if he can&#39;t make it, I&#39;m sure he&#39;d send some note of congratulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyree smiled and nodded at the memory of meeting up with Melbourne during the visit to see the progress on the Animalian colony in the Amazon. His welcome had been kind and even pleased in a way with their conversion. Tyree had liked that, though given her work at the zoo she ran in northern Australia, she had to admit that she had a soft spot for anyone that liked animals, and in particular the Thylacine. And Melbourne&#39;s welcome was a enough to touch on both the things that Tyree had a soft spot for.<br />
<br />
They made their way out to ultimately be met by a small group of people in a sort of restaurant area just after the terminals. One was a representative of the International Thylacine Specimen Database, which had helped fund Ben and Tyree&#39;s trip to America in the first place and the other was a representative of the Australian government, though they thought that man to be an aide of some kind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back home,&quot; the government man spoke politely and soon shook both Ben and Tyree&#39;s hands as they approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would appear that project was a success,&quot; the ITSD scientist said in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it was,&quot; Ben answered, &quot;Two live Thylacine Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ITSD scientist came forward and tentatively reached out to rub the fur on Ben&#39;s arm seemed very pleased with the result. He eventually smiled and commented to them, &quot;We may need some blood, fur, and tissue samples before you head home... but this is a great success. Restoring an animal that is very much a part of Australia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That IS why we volunteered,&quot; Tyree gave a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what was Animalia&#39;s response to you and the request that was made?&quot; the government aide asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;About the same as you would see on television with regard to other Animalians, quite friendly and curious,&quot; Ben answered, &quot;I don&#39;t think many had seen a Thylacine before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They weren&#39;t on edge over what happened with that Wilcox woman? Or this past Halloween?&quot; the government aide wondered.<br />
<br />
Ben and Tyree traded glances for a moment. Both of them knew about Heather Wilcox&#39;s attack earlier in the fall, and they&#39;d stayed at a hotel in Lyre long enough to have some fun at the Halloween Carnival. The reports of this rogue group of rats kidnapping had been a surprise, but from what they&#39;d read in the local papers the situation had been handled  and that Animalia and Horizon both seemed relieved that nothing  had been too serious on the incident.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... there were some security measures they had to prevent a repeat of Heather Wilcox&#39;s attack... but for the most part Animalia&#39;s taken quite a lot of things in stride,&quot; Tyree said slowly, &quot;and from what they reported... most of what happened with regard to Halloween was with a group that were similar to Animalians but not quite... I think the result of a proto-form of the virus, as it were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that has been contained?&quot; the government aide questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ben nodded, &quot;and both Tyree and I have been vaccinated. So if anyone else wants to become Thylacines... they&#39;ll need to go to Horizon. Thankfully we did leave them with enough in the way of DNA samples for the Thylacine strain that that wouldn&#39;t be a problem... and will mean that there is no risk of there being major accidents with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; the government aide gave a sigh and wiped his brow, &quot;between all the trouble that the Cane Toad has given us... the LAST thing Australia needs is a bio-hazard nightmare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That isn&#39;t a problem,&quot; Ben assured him, &quot;though Animalia does have some curiosity into the idea of a colony for Animalians in Australia... though for the moment, given some pushes in Animalia for colonies elsewhere... that isn&#39;t something that they&#39;re going to be pushing hard on for the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have no problem with them wanting to visit... and would have no problem if Australian citizens wish to become Animalians,&quot; the government aide spoke, &quot;but any sort of &quot;colony&quot; project will need to comply with our immigration laws with the rights of the land owners. We aren&#39;t going to chase some rancher off his land because Animalia wants a colony.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben and Tyree both nodded as that was an answer they sort of suspected. The government didn&#39;t seem to have any problem with Animalia in general and wouldn&#39;t have major issue with Australians becoming Animalians, but they didn&#39;t want to have any issue that would force massive restructuring of either local land rights or their own immigration and customs laws. But it was a request that Animalia had.<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;re accepting to the idea... but they&#39;ve also proposed ideas in having Animalians that could help with various things from herding to scientific study and to local security...&quot; Ben spoke, &quot;Like keeping problem crocs and Dingoes at bay without needing massive fences and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d still be something to talk with individuals on, not with me,&quot; the government aide spoke, &quot;though we might be interested depending on what they can offer and offer some help in the nuts and bolts coordination in that regard. But it would still need to be something that individual Australians agree to. The last thing we need is to start some massive project requiring people to change and have it be a reenactment of the Great Emu War.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m sure Animalia would be more than willing to work with you on that,&quot; Tyree spoke, &quot;but for the moment it&#39;s just an idea they&#39;re floating around... Nothing super serious at the moment. As was said... they have a fair number of other projects they&#39;re working on right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The government aide nodded calmly and then backed up to let Ben and Tyree continue on with the International Thylacine Specimen Database scientist. The group then slowly continued on their way before the ITSD scientist said to both Thylacine Animalians.<br />
<br />
&quot;And congratulations on your engagement,&quot; the ITSD scientist spoke.</p>
