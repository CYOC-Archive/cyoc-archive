<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the Stevens home, Tom came into the bedroom that he was presently sharing with his fiancé, Alice Stevens. The room was her old bedroom and the bed was smaller than the one they&#39;d shared in Seattle, which did serve as a reminder of the overall situation he was in. While his plan for the big reveal was plodding along, and the quiet night, so far, gave him some hope that the people of Moon Lake were actually starting to accept it or at least calm down from the initial rage about it. That made him feel happy, and particularly happy to see Alice crouching on her bed in wereform, underwear, and a very nice smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re looking very pretty this evening,&quot; Tom said with a small smile as his nose picked a slight scent of arousal as he got closer and he could hear what sounded like some soft yips and chittering coming from the master bedroom. It gave some indication on what Alice&#39;s parents were doing, though with Alice&#39;s aroused scent, Tom was more than willing to join in with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I always do,&quot; Alice smiled back as she looked to Tom as he came in and began slipping out of his clothes as well. Her smile grew bigger as she could see a bulge beginning to form in Tom&#39;s pants. &quot;But that&#39;s also because my bonded mate is very handsome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More contented that things have been quiet so far,&quot; Tom answered as he finished unbuttoning his shirt and began to release his inner fox, relishing the warmth as reddish fur began to cover his body with the exception of the white fur on his chest. He approached as he ran his paw like hands along Alice&#39;s shoulders as stubby claws began to grow out from his black furred hands. They softly combed her fur as well. He smiled as his face pushed forward into a fox&#39;s pointed muzzle and his ears heard a contented sigh from Alice. &quot;And that gives me the hope for something good to come...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something good is going to cum,&quot; Alice gave a seductive smile and began unbuttoning Tom&#39;s pants, freeing his growing red brush tail with a white tip at its end and then licked at Tom&#39;s muzzle, &quot;which hopefully we can both enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we can,&quot; Tom answered as the two werefoxes climbed onto the bed and he began gently massaging and licking at Alice&#39;s body to ready her for the main event between them. It was something that made him feel quite happy in being with someone that made him happy and with that bond between them telling him that Alice was the one that would be forever. He couldn&#39;t be fully sure on all that would happen, but as he looked to Alice, all Tom could see was the beautiful woman he&#39;d fallen for and who he&#39;d do anything to make her happy and free... which was a part of his entire reveal plan. She deserved a world where she didn&#39;t have to hide who she was.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In the woods, Tad and Amy lay together after a fairly furious bout of love making to essentially culminate the date that Tad had planned. The movie might not have been exactly what Tad had hoped for, but the young male werewolf was quite pleased with just spending times with the white furred female werewolf that was with him, and that wasn&#39;t something that related to the fact that his canine knot was presently tying them together. It was true that Amy was a bit more forward than any girls that Tad had known before, but then most of the girls that Tad had known were normal humans and he&#39;d never been quite comfortable enough to essentially tell them. But with Amy also being a were, Tad felt quite happy just to know her.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately a heavy gurgling in his stomach soon interrupted his thoughts and running his hands over Amy&#39;s furred abdominals. She turned to him with a bit of a chuckle as his stomach gurgled...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hungary?&quot; Amy asked with a bit of a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit, I suppose,&quot; Tad smiled back weakly and lowering his ears a little, &quot;I mean... we did skip dinner to come out here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was fun, though,&quot; Amy smiled and licked at Tad&#39;s muzzle, &quot;let&#39;s say we wait for that wonderful penis of yours to deflate... we&#39;ll disengage, for the moment and we can head back to your house. See if your mom and her fiancee left us any leftovers. My parents are probably in bed by now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So would my mom and Claire,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;though I&#39;d think that like us... they aren&#39;t exactly sleeping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy gave a happy giggle and wiggled her hips a little, shaking Tad&#39;s penis a little, as it was still burried deep in her vagina. It left Tad with a bit of a grunting moan and gave one more small burst into his girlfriend. A part of him thought he should have some opinion on that, but from all that he&#39;d found, a lot of Moon Lake&#39;s weres seemed to enjoy more &quot;adult&quot; pursuits, and that had included his own mother. Once his mother found Claire and transformed her... Tad had noted that his mother had seemed happier. It wasn&#39;t that she wasn&#39;t able to recover from Jeff Decker&#39;s murder on her own, but once Tad noted that his mother had Claire... certain elements of her happiness came back<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s probably the case for most everyone,&quot; Amy giggled, &quot;hopefully something that lets Moon Lake get its head on straight with this whole reveal thing... regardless of which way it ends up going. Fighting each other isn&#39;t going to solve any problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
At the Decker house, things quieted a bit after Jade had gotten what she needed to know, and Jen did see the werekomododragon to the door, while marveling a bit to the infant that Jade held close to her. It was something that reminded her of her days as a new mother with Tad as a baby, and a part of her missed those days. When Tad was young and his eyes dark but innocent. There was always something cute about a baby that brought out Jen&#39;s inner mother, and she could understand Jade&#39;s worries on that basis. Weres being revealed to the world would change a lot of precedents in were society a new mother would likely find that new world to be quite challenging, regardless of the decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully the two of them make it out okay,&quot; Claire commented to Jen, &quot;as she did seem rather frightened by all this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless of its necessity... it IS something to be feared,&quot; Jen stated, &quot;there is a reason were society has tried to hide for as long as it has. We may be at a point where it won&#39;t work anymore and thus weres HAVE to come out into the open... but that won&#39;t change the fears that people have... particularly the older weres that have likely never left Moon Lake and thus don&#39;t know how different the world really is beyond the woods around this town...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re willing to face these fears?&quot; Claire asked as she paused to massage Jen&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
&quot;If only to set things on the right path...&quot; Jen slowly sighed and turned back to her fiancée, &quot;as if this hits us anyway... continuing to hide won&#39;t help us at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire nodded, &quot;Hopefully it works... in the meantime, our dinner should be ready... as should anything we&#39;d leave for Tad and Amy as leftovers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded and then turned back to Claire, &quot;and what would we do from there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The night is young,&quot; Claire purred, &quot;I&#39;m sure we can find something to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The house was rather dark by the time that Tad and Amy arrived, still in their wolven forms. The hike through the woods had taken a little while, particularly when it came to avoiding areas where there was more private property which Amy guided Tad through. His nose picked up the scent of what Claire and Jen had been cooking earlier and it drifted to him from the kitchen area as he opened the back door to the Decker home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom made chicken,&quot; Tad said to Amy as he sat his clothes down on the couch and looked over to his girlfriend as she walked around him.<br />
<br />
She was casually sniffing around as well, and Tad was fairly sure that she could smell the chicken too. Werewolves had a great sense of smell. They also had great ears, and Tad and Amy could both faintly hear some &quot;mews&quot; coming from upstairs, which gave them some idea on what Jen and Claire were up to. Tad had no problem with that, and for the moment his hunger was more important than his mother&#39;s love life. Amy set her clothing down on a different section of the couch and the two made their way into the kitchen to find two sets of plates with aluminum foil covering them. As they got closer, Tad did get the sense that they were still relatively warm... not super warm, but warm enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s lost some of its heat,&quot; Amy commented, though a gurgle in her own stomach interrupted her from going any further, &quot;not that I&#39;m complaining.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d hope not,&quot; Tad commented to her as they moved the plates to the small table in the kitchen and near the window to look out into the backyard and the pool, &quot;it&#39;d ruin what&#39;s been a good night... quiet... no fighting... fine company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we can&#39;t have that,&quot; Amy laughed and nodded.<br />
<br />
The two nodded and set about eating, being careful to make sure that no grease or anything got in their fur, with some degree of success. This lead to both licking the paws of the other to clean things away. As they finished, the two simply sat and looked to each other for a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a great time,&quot; Amy said to him after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if the movie wasn&#39;t great?&quot; Tad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The company made up for it,&quot; Amy smiled as she looked to Tad. He&#39;d grown up away from Moon Lake, and while he&#39;d matured into a very handsome man, there were times where he was rather innocent when it came to many of the things that went on in Moon Lake. Amy was happy to help Tad out there, but then at the same time, she&#39;d found she actually liked that to a certain extent. There were a few weres she knew that were not only forward but shamelessly confident in a way. And while they might make for good partners when the pack had its meetings and had fun at them, it was never quite the sort to bring home and say, &quot;he&#39;s boyfriend material.&quot; Tad fit that sort of bill, and had also been helpful with regard to her brothers, and she&#39;d always be thankful for that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully Connor and Ryan had a good night,&quot; Tad commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they did,&quot; Amy chuckled, &quot;Ryan&#39;s seemed to have a bit of a crush... not something I&#39;ve really seen...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he&#39;s been helpful to Connor,&quot; Tad said slowly, &quot;and... well, I still can&#39;t believe I never saw anything that would suggest Connor was bi... if I did... I could have had him talk to my mom. She knows all that kind of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She knows from her experience,&quot; Amy told him, and gave an assuring smile, &quot;I know you&#39;re looking out for your friend... but a lot of this for Connor is likely something for him to figure out on his own. The best we can be is supportive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d figured we might have run into them in the woods... you know... if things had gone right for them,&quot; Tad commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Given that werewildcats aren&#39;t all that big... until we&#39;re absolutely sure there won&#39;t be any more fighting or rioting,&quot; Amy commented, &quot;it might be best they weren&#39;t out in the woods. Besides... I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll hear from Connor at least tomorrow...&quot;</p>
