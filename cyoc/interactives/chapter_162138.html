<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie and Kellie now found themselves relaxing under a set of palm trees, an impish smile on their face as they watched a pair of children play in the surf.<br />
<br />
&quot;I cant believe you turned them into kids,&quot; Kellie chuckled as she watched the 6 year old blond girl splash in the Hawaiian surf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh c&#39;mon,&quot; Katie smirked. &quot;You heard them. John and Millie wished they had known eachother before high school. I&#39;m just granting that wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie shook her head, laughing softly as she watched the now 6 year old John play with his wife in the surf. The newlywed couple had left their hotel room after regressing an elderly couple into their 20s. Deciding to chat with them they quickly discovered John and Millie believed themselves to also be on their honeymoon. After chatting with them Katie and Kellie discovered the former elderly couple turned athlete were indeed high school sweethearts. They had met freshman year and began dating shortly there after. John of course was a standout football player with Millie cheering him on from the sidelines as a member of the cheer squad. <br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie found the couple to be quite friendly and enjoyed their company immensely. When they discovered that the two wished they had met even sooner, Katie just couldnt help herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I dont think we asked them if they were prom king and queen,&quot; Kellie mused as she watched the children play. &quot;We&#39;ll ask them when they grow back up,&quot; Katie shrugged. &quot;But you got to admit they both never had an awkward phase. I mean I had no idea you kids could be so adorable. Hell they never even had acne.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some people are lucky I guess,&quot; Kellie shrugged. &quot;Know we weren&#39;t so fortunate.&quot; Katie smiled, leaning over to give her wife a gentle kiss. &quot;I always thought you were cute. Who knows, maybe we join these two, have a bit of innocent fun ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tempting,&quot; Kellie chuckled. &quot;But I was thinking of some not so innocent fun we could have, just you and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the couple now gazed lovingly into each others eyes, they were startled by an explosion just down the beach. Jumping out of their lounge chairs, they were shocked to see people screaming in fear as they ran. &quot;Mrs. Carlson what&#39;s going on,&quot; John asked.<br />
<br />
Katie narrowed her eyes, there was too much smoke to get a clear picture. &quot;I&#39;m not sure John,&quot; she said. Looking first to the children, before turning towards her wife she nodded. &quot;John why dont you take Millie inside,&quot; she said. &quot;It will be safe in there.&quot; John nodded, grabbing the young girls hand as they raced back towards the hotel. As they did Katie wished the two back to 25, already seeing the two young children were growing taller as they got older.<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie now raced towards the explosion, weaving in between beachgoers who ran screaming in the other direction. &quot;You think this is a good idea,&quot; Kellie asked as a terrified man bolted past them. Katie frowned, this wasn&#39;t a great idea but she needed to know if their was anything they could do to help. They quickly realized though they should have gone in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie gasped as they beheld a large group of Voids. &quot;Voids,&quot; Kellie whispered, skidding to a stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;And worse,&quot; Katie grumbled, pointing at the massive creature standing behind them.<br />
<br />
Malak snarled as he surveyed the beach. The humans they had already attacked had been no challenge, their crumpled and mangled bodies scattered about. He would take the bodies back with him when this was done, they would make fine Voids to add to Villars army. Gazing at the two bathing suit clad blond women in front of him, a small smile smile spread across his face. &quot;Finally a challenge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Attack,&quot; Malak snarled. The Voids needed little prompting, howling as they surged forward to attack. Katie and Kellie were ready, unleashing a blast of magical energy at the first line, knocking them backwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stall them,&quot; Kellie yelled. &quot;I need a minute.&quot; Katie nodded, unleashing a flurry of attacks as Kellie began to concentrate. Kellie was usually fully clothed when she cast the guardian spell. Dressed only in a bikini now she hoped she could pull it off. <br />
<br />
The red two piece began to glow, shimmering as the spell took affect. Slowly but surely it began to spread across her body, the material stretching past her breasts and encasing her upper body in armor. The bottom half did the same, snaking it&#39;s way down her legs, eventually encasing her feet. As the spell completed Kellie summoned forth her shield, narrowing her eyes as she stared down the Voids.<br />
<br />
Katie was holding the Voids at bay, but for how long? The creatures were incredibly resilient, even after unleashing a blast that would turn a stone wall to pebbles they kept coming. Thankfully she didnt need to wait much longer as Kellie charged forth, knocking several Voids back. &quot;Took you long enough,&quot; Katie smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny,&quot; Kellie grinned. &quot;Now let&#39;s finish this and get back to our honeymoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded, gesturing towards Malak. Kellie understood her wives intent, take out the leader and the attack would end. Charging forward Katie now covered her wife, knocking several Voids clear. Kellie would have a clear shot at whatever this creature was, focusing her magic into the shield she had conjured she intended to deliver what she believed to be a death blow.<br />
<br />
Malak could see what the two wizards were doing. A small smile spread across his face as he watched Kellie leap into the air. As she brought the shield down Malak could hear the impact. A lesser creature would have had their head taken off, for Malak though it simply turned his head to the side.<br />
<br />
Kellies eyes went wide, that blow should of ended this! Instead Malak slowly turned his head,  a small cut on his brow showing the results of Kellies attack. &quot;Pitiful,&quot; he growled as he snatched Kellie by the neck and slammed her to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kellie,&quot; Katie screamed, watching as the massive creature now began to repeatedly slam her wife into the sand. For now Kellies magical armor was holding, but for how long? Katie released a blast of energy, knocking the Voids back and causing Malak to shield his eyes with his free hand. <br />
<br />
Katie began to transform, her body slimming while becoming more muscular. The young womans eyes transforming into pools of light as wings sprouted from her back. Letting out a cry of rage the now angelic wizard shot forward, connecting with a punch directly to Malaks face.<br />
<br />
Malak grunted, dropping Kellie as he was sent backwards. The creature was surprised and dazed, he had not expected that the wizards had this much power. &quot;I will feast on your bones,&quot; he roared, drool falling from his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kel are you okay,&quot; Katie asked fearfully as she helped her wife to her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just had the wind knocked out of me,&quot; Kellie grunted. As the newlyweds prepared themselves to continue the fight they wondered what exactly they were dealing with.</p>
