<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the course of the following weeks, after having sex with Dan’s best friend Han Soto, causing him to fertilize the ovum which had once been her brother Dan, Kat uses her power to cause the DNA of her former brother to be more Asian, not wanting to risk her baby to look like Dan, having Dan look more Asian than Caucasian, Kat is certain that no one, especially her mother, will suspect a thing.<br />
<br />
Few more weeks pass, finally Kat’s mother gives up trying to find her missing son, “I don’t know what happened to Dan,” Janet says one evening, “I don’t understand why I just can’t locate his energy”.<br />
<br />
“As I said, maybe he run away and his location is just outside of your range,” Kat says.<br />
<br />
“That’s what I have thought of myself,” Janet replies, “but even the elders, who have far greater powers, are unable to locate him. In order for someone’s energy to suddenly vanish, is for that person to be deceased, however, there is no evidence that Dan is dead, if he were, his name would have appeared in the “book of death”. The more I think about it, I’m starting to believe that someone with powerful magic has gotten his or her hands on Dan”.<br />
<br />
Kat tilts her head, “who would do something like that,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Janet shrugs, “either someone who has a grudge against our family,” Janet says, “however I can’t think of anyone who does. I have no issue with anyone”.<br />
<br />
“What if it’s some undocumented witch or wizard,” Kat asks, “there are plenty of those out there”.<br />
<br />
“That is a major possibility,” Janet says, nodding, “those magic users, who stay hidden, who we have no record of, are the most dangerous. I really do feel like one of those has Dan, which means we’ll never find him since those… beings know how to prevent the energy of their “toy” of sending out a stress signal”.<br />
<br />
“So, there is nothing you or we can do?”<br />
<br />
Janet shakes her head, “no, and honestly, I am tired,” she says, “I’ll get over the loss, besides… he was a lazy kid. Wherever he is… WHATEVER he is… and WHOEVER has him… I hope he is more useful”.<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, while inwardly smirking, “yeah, I hope so too,” she says, ‘luckily she hasn’t figured out yet that I am pregnant, good thing my powers have increased so much, thanks to that loser, I am able to hide my pregnancy from her,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I think it’s about time to move out of this house’.<br />
<br />
Janet, noticing Kat’s thoughtful expression, looks at her daughter, “what are you thinking about?”<br />
<br />
“Hm, oh, nothing mom,” Kat says, “I was just thinking, now that I am 18, maybe it’s time for me to move out”.<br />
<br />
Janet raises an eyebrow, “are you sure you are ready,” she asks, “you’ll have so many responsibilities, and living costs a fortune nowadays”.<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “I know ma,” she says, “don’t you worry, I’ve already searched for a good paying job, and I am not planning to move into a massive apartment. I’ll find the right place for me”.<br />
<br />
“Just be careful, hun,” Janet says, “don’t let anyone give you false hopes”.<br />
<br />
Kat chuckles, “mom, I’m 18, I’ll manage”.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Janet says, “do you have something in mind?”<br />
<br />
“Well, there are a few available apartments near the beach,” Kat says, “I know that they could be expensive, if that’s the case, I’ll see if I can find a cheaper place outside of town”.<br />
<br />
Janet nods, “sounds like you have a plan,” she says, “I’ll support you, no matter what you choose, just make sure it’s the right place, that you feel safe, and it doesn’t cost to much!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, mom,” Kat says, “I think I’ll head to the beach today and check out those apartments”.<br />
<br />
“Alright, keep me informed,” Janet says, “and if you found a place you like, I’d like to see it before you make a decision”.<br />
<br />
“Alright, mom,” Kat says, grabbing her purse, “I’ll be back in the evening,” with that Kat exits the house.<br />
<br />
Janet looks after her daughter out of the window as Kat walks down the street, ‘she doesn’t seem bothered with Dan missing,’ she thinks to herself, ‘instead she seems to be happy about it. At first I thought she might have something to do with his disappearance, but I can’t imagine she’d be capable of doing something to Dan, her powers have just awoken, she is not powerful enough to do anything major. I think it’s because they never got along and she is just happy to not have her annoying little brother around anymore,’ and with that Janet simply goes back to cleaning the house.<br />
<br />
The hours pass and after checking out a few apartments, all of which did look amazing, but the prices were just to high, Kat decides to walk along the beach promenade.<br />
<br />
As Kat walks along the promenade, she hears the sound of tiny feet behind her, “mistress,” Kat smiles when she hears the familiar voice, turning around her smile widens as she sees Ben, wearing only a blue tight swim short, and another boy who she doesn’t recognize, walk up to her.<br />
<br />
“Hey there, Ben,” Kat says cheerfully, “how’s my little pup doing? And who’s your friend?”<br />
<br />
Ben grins up at Kat, not noticing his bum wriggling as if he were wagging, “this is my friend Cody,” Ben says.<br />
<br />
Cody, who looks to be 11, has short black hair, an olive skin tone, turquoise eyes and an athletic figure, wearing a black baggy knee length swim short, looks between Ben and Kat, a confused expression on his face.<br />
<br />
“Ben, the hell,” he asks, “why are you acting so weird?”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean, Cody,” Ben asks.<br />
<br />
“You are wriggling your but and calling that lady “mistress”… you’re acting as if you were her… pet dog or something,” Cody says, “it’s freaking me out!”<br />
<br />
Kat chuckles, “sorry, Cody, if it bothers you,” she says, “Ben loves playing pretend, so I promised him, whenever he sees me, he can pretend being my pet dog”.<br />
<br />
“That is so freaky and weird,” Cody says, noticeably bothered by the way Ben is acting.<br />
<br />
Not wanting Cody to make a scene and draw attention to them, Kat quickly comes up with an idea on how to deal with the 11-year-old. Kat’s eyes begin to glow blue, “silly Cody, it shouldn’t bother you at all,” she says, “after all, you are nothing but an object, and a object doesn’t think nor care about anything!”<br />
<br />
Cody looks up at Kat, directly into the eyes of the witch, “what are you talking about,” he asks, “you cr-craaaazy…,” the boy suddenly falls silent, his eyes beginning to glow in the same blue color, his body slumping slightly as it relaxes.<br />
<br />
Ben tilts his head, “mistress, what’s wrong with Cody,” he asks, leaning in to sniff at his friend, letting out a whimper, “is… is he sick?”<br />
<br />
Kat smirks, “I think he is”.<br />
<br />
“Can you help him, mistress,” Ben asks, looking up at Kat hopefully.<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “of course I can, pup,” she says, “but let’s go somewhere more private. By the way, why are you wearing a swim short and walking on upright?”<br />
<br />
Ben looks down, his eyes widen in surprise, “s-sorry, mistress,” he says and immediately pulls down his swim shorts, and simply letting them fall to the ground, before dropping down onto his hands. Once his hands touch the wood of the promenade, his hands and feet turn into furless paws, while his legs, arms and rest of his body remains human, a clicking from his back indicating that his spine had locked into place, “I… I didn’t realize! Pl-please don’t be mad!”<br />
<br />
Kat grins, “I am not mad, pup,” she says, “you just forgot, you have a lot to learn still, but one step at a time. Now, let’s take care of Cody here, I know the perfect place to help him, it’s secluded and we’ll be undisturbed”.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, wriggling his butt, “okay, mistress,” he says.<br />
<br />
Kat grins, turning her attention back to Cody, “follow,” she simply says, beginning to walk, Ben on her left and Cody on her right, no one seeming to pay the weird trio any attention as they head along the promenade and towards the part of town, known for its abandoned houses, crime and all the “not good stuff”, a perfect place to “help” Cody.</p>
