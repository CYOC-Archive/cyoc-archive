<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was quite obvious what Jake was going to do to Luke. It was what most horny college students would do if they had this technology and found out they were gay. Jake was going to turn Luke into his boyfriend. Although, he wasn&#39;t just going to age up Luke and make sure he was gay. No, that would be boring. So he began typing up the changes he wanted to make for Luke.<br />
<br />
Name: Luke Judd<br />
Age: 18<br />
Height: 6&#39;3&quot;<br />
Build: Muscular<br />
Sexuality: Homosexual<br />
Relationship to Jacopo Marcus DeSantos: Boyfriend<br />
Persona: Himbo<br />
<br />
After Jake had entered all the relevant data, all he had to do was wait for the changes to finish.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Luke was in his room, surfing the web when he suddenly felt a warmth rush over him. Well, that was odd, but Luke merely thought the air conditioning broke or something. He moved to open a window to let in some cool air, but that was when he noticed the window was lower than it usually was. No, wait, was he taller now?! Luke rushed to the mirror and found that his ankles were showing now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, I had a growth spurt!&quot; Luke was pretty excited. Maybe his older brother wouldn&#39;t pick on him for being a shrimp. However, that excitement was soon replaced with concern once he saw that his stomach started to show from beneath his shirt. Wait, that wasn&#39;t like that a few minutes ago! He knew that kids grew fast, but not this fast. Luke looked up at the mirror to see someone who looked thirteen rather than ten staring back at him. Was he getting older?<br />
<br />
Luke was getting taller at an alarming rate. The shirt and slacks he was wearing now looked like a crop top and shorts. Luke should have been excited that he was just as tall, if not taller than his older brother, but not like this. Once Luke past age 16, he started to bulk quickly. Lean, lanky limbs that were his arms were now puffing up to round biceps and triceps. Shoulders grew wider and rounder. Luke could see his once flat midriff gain texture as abs formed. However, it was Luke&#39;s pecs and back growing that finally cause his shirt to get torn off of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What&#39;s happening to me?!&quot; Luke wanted to scream for help, but before the mental and reality changes kicked in. Why was he panicking? He was a college student; of course, he was an adult. And why was he worried about his shirt? He hardly ever wore shirts at home. After all, why would he want to hide the sculpted bod he spent so much time at the gym building?<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa! My arms are looking pumped.&quot; Kyle said to himself as he flexed them, not realizing they were literally growing right before his eyes. He got to keep these arms pumped, as these were the real moneymakers for when he became a personal trainer. Although, he was finding classes quite difficult. It was like the information that did not pertain to fitness, boys, and sex just spilled out of him. Oh well, if he fails his degree, he could always just become a fitness model or something like that. While Kyle was admiring his arms, the pants he wore when he was 10 finally ripped apart from his growing legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, legs looking nice!&quot; Kyle was glad all those leg days at the gym paid off, and Jake especially liked them. Ah, Jake, they were childhood friends who decided to work out together to get ripped, and along the way, they realized their sexuality and feelings for each other. God, just thinking of Jake was making Luke hard, which was enough to shread his underwear. The last vestiges of the child Luke were gone, and replacing them was a hardening piece of manhood. Soon, the final changes were occurring. Luke&#39;s hair had styled itself into a spiker, jock-styled hairstyle. His room then shifted. Gone were the childhood toys and decorations as they were replaced by college textbooks and free weights. Finally, a new pair of boxers and shorts appeared on Luke, but not a shirt, of course. No need to hide his sculpted bod after all.<br />
<br />
Luke was flexing in the mirror, doing his usual posing routine before he had a thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, was I doing something before?&quot; Luke asked himself, but as hard as he could think, he couldn&#39;t remember. Oh well, this wasn&#39;t the first time this happened, and it wouldn&#39;t be the last. Maybe he should upload some pics while he was flexing.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Whoa. That was hot. Jake thought. Sure he couldn&#39;t see the transformation in person, but he could see the 3D replication of what was happening on the Chronivac. It was then he got a notification on his phone. It was Luke posting some vanity photos on his socials. Jake studied the photos, and the way Luke&#39;s muscles bulged in them made Jake aroused.<br />
<br />
Perhaps time for the Italian man to pay his boyfriend a visit, or maybe he should make some changes with the Chronivac before he does that</p>
