<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pete decided to become a frog as a first experience. He wasn&#39;t always fond of frogs but when he thought about animal transformations he reminded of all the movies and cartoons he used to watch as a child where the guy or the prince always got zapped into a hopping amphibian. It couldn&#39;t be that bad, though!<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be a frog&quot; he murmured to himself, still incredulous about the voices he had heard. WHat were they anyway? Cosmic entities from outter space? Pete closed his eyes as a way to better focus himself.  He smiled; how could he be 26 and believe he could transform himself into any animal or insect? How naïve and childish could he be?<br />
<br />
He just kept sitting and looking at the TV. He didn&#39;t know how much time it spend but somehow he took his hand to his face, feeling it cold and wet. Pete took a better look at it to find it painted with a yellowish-green hue, as if he was sick and what looked like a darker patch forming in his arm. He got up scared and saw his arms loosing the hair and mammal skin and attaining a slimy sheen. He felt what he thought it was sweat as if he had ran the marathon. Pete removed his t-shirt and was surprised to see that his torso was tainted green with brown-yellowish spots covering all over him. The skin chnages kept crawling until his arms too were covered in the same colour and texture. <br />
<br />
&quot;Am I turning into a frog?&quot;, was Pete&#39;s first thought. He was going to verbalize it but his throat only produced a very clear answer: &quot;RIBBIT!&quot;<br />
<br />
He was terrified!<br />
<br />
Pete stormed out of the living room, up the stairs to his bathroom so he could see the changes. However an acute pain in his feet threw him on the staris. He kicked them off and watched as his feet were elongating right in front of him, like in transformation scene from &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;. The toes were twitching  and his bones were popping.Pete crawled the stairs and managed to stand on two feet: his toes were freakishly long and webbing formed between them. He walked as if he had swimming flippers, he turned on the lights and saw himself on the mirror. He was appauled to realize that somehow his hair had fallen, he had brown patches on his bald head and the only remenant of his manhood was his mustache. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool!&quot;, he finally thought.<br />
<br />
His legs muscles twitched. He quickly took his hands to his pants, but as he tried to take them his tights were already too strong stuck them out. However as he was trying to take them off, suddenly all of his prespective changed. His sight blurred and he had the impression he was going down a spiral. He fell down on the floor and felt his jeans on his back...it only hit him a while after that he had shrinked to the size of a common frog.<br />
<br />
&quot;RIBBIT&quot; he involuntairly croaked. Pete let a scream out as his spine popped out and he adopted a frog like posture. His tighs, belly and torso were completely changed. His bald patche dhead had lost his mustache meanwhile. Just like the bone son his feet now his little human hands were twitching and forming a webbing inbetween his figners, right in front of him. His finger nails fell and soon he had a full pair of frog hands. While this his face was also changing; he only noticed it when his eyes were exerted out of his skull,  a pressure on top of his mouth were the sign his skull was rearring itself. Pete croaked again. His neck fused with the rest of his body and soon he was a complete frog.</p>
