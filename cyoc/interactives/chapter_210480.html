<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The dinner was set for the three witches and the wizard, but not only. From what James, in spite of his humiliated state, could gather, they had invited another person. A guest from the Fay World. Something he would have scoffed at a mere few hours ago but that he had no problem considering as real and to even fear. James had to help with the food, which consisted in a golden roast chicken and potatoes and green beans in a rich gravy, all smelling delicious. Magnus had made a diaper appear upon his groin and a red collar at his neck, furthering his utter humiliation, but at least he did not have to go around with his penis and testicles in the open and seen by all. At least the prospect of eating nice food would make things better, if only slightly better. Or at least, that was what he thought. Because as the doorbell rang, Magnus made a child&#39;s table appear. with two dog bowls upon it. He ordered James to go there, asking him with a smirk if he preferred dry or wet dog food. James muttered the dry dog food option under his breath and he saw one bowl with it accordingly. He crouched at the kiddie table and he was fuming. However, he justified resentment vanished as he saw the wizard arriving. Ganak, his name was. But his name was the least strange thing about him. His face was human enough but he was huge, very tall and if he had two legs, he had multiple arms, ten in total, and his back was a sort of soft-like yet hard shell, as if he was part insect. As he came from the Fairylands, well, his appearance must be normal for them. Ganak greeted everyone warmly and offered boxes of chocolates containing the deserts. He then raised an eyebrow at James but Magnus explained fast who he was and everyone seated at the table, chatting animatedly. From what he could hear and follow, James realized that Ganak traded in human wares and things in the Fay World and that it could be very profitable. He also traded human beings which he kidnapped, which James thought utterly disturbing and dreadful. Everyone ate heartily and as they all finished with cups of coffee and the proffered chocolates. But then Ganak pointed at James and asked the four magical beings if he&#39;d consider selling the human here because he could make a hearty profit from James in the Fay World after a few more transformations. James blanched but Magnus and the witches protested. They barely had had James! So much fun could still be had! Ganak countered by saying that humans were the most malleable for transformations and that fay creatures would pay many gold coins to have a transformed James as a child of their own or a pet. All five argued and James could only be frightened and watch on. <br />
&quot;What say you, boy?&quot; asked Ganak with a smile and a sly wink. &quot;Do you prefer waiting as a dog here or get a new life in the Fay World? I promise I&#39;ll make sure you go to good owners or parents.&quot;  <br />
The other four laughed and jeered, all shouting their point of view, arguing that James was just a pet, and leaving James speechless. He just wanted to be human again and if he stayed here, how long would he have to wait until he was human once again, and after how many further ridiculous transformations? Meanwhile, the magical beings kept talking and in the end Ganak and his wizard pal were left talking friendly yet still heatedly. <br />
&quot;Tell you what, boy,&quot;said Ganak again. &quot;You win a bet and you can choose yourself wether you stay here or come with me. Or Magnus will give you back your human appearance. You lose, you come with me, period. What do you say? There’s an opportunity to recover your original human shape,&quot; he smiled slyly.<br />
At this James felt his heart flutter. He had an opportunity! A real chance to leave this horrible place with his own body! He just had to win this bet. He just hoped it wasn’t too hard so he asked what it was.<br />
&quot;I say you&#39;re too feeble and wimpy to stay with Magnus and his wives. He maintains the opposite. So we&#39;ll test your strength. Don&#39;t laugh. Does that sound all right?&quot;<br />
To not laugh? Really, that sounded easy. James eagerly accepted. He could get back his human shape so easily! This was unexpected yet perfect! He must accept. But as soon as he agreed and nodded to the condition, he understood how foolish he&#39;d been. Before he knew what was happening, Gana had seized him in his many arms and immobilized him. His back was pressing against the smooth torso of the creature and his arms were held upwards. He struggled, confused, until a gasp escaped his lips. Luckily, he managed to clamp his jaws shut. Ganak was tickling him! If he laughed, it was over! And he had to hold on fifteen minutes! So he wriggled and squirmed while he felt fingers dexterously gliding and brushing his armpits, then poking and wriggling. Annoyed at the youth&#39;s resistance, Ganak even went so far as to peppering little kisses there! It was a real torture for James but frustrated and pressed for time, Ganak attacked other possible weak points. James prayed Ganak would waste time in testing many places upon his body and that the time would be up faster. However, the creature had no intention of relinquishing his prize. If he won, selling James would mean all the profit would go to him! And he planned on making a huge profit as a further loss, Magnus would help him with the spells for free. So it wasn&#39;t this silly little human who thought he could squirm out of his tickled without giggling who&#39;d cheat him out of it! Time was ticking, so Ganak tried the knees. Not much of a reaction there. Then he tried the belly, ribs, chin and feet. Promising but which one would be the most likely to elicit the desired peals of laughter? He concentrated on the belly, brushing delicate little circles and hitting all the tiny nerves he could, whispering in James ear in a very soft voice, as caressing as he could.<br />
&quot;Give up , boy. I&#39;ll win anyway. Give up now and I promise not to tickle you into a sobbing, twitching mess afterwards when you laugh at last. Give up and I might go easy on you on your transformation and make sure you end up with good parents. Sounds good? I&#39;m generous, you know.&quot;<br />
&quot;N... Never....&quot; uttered James through gritted teeth.<br />
&quot;Have it you way, then,&quot; said Ganak with an assurance he was sensing dwindling deep inside him.<br />
As an early revenge, he planted a big fat smooch on James&#39; cheek.<br />
&quot;Little baby is getting tired. Little baby should give up and see his new papa and mama soon!&quot; he jeered with coos and while patting with much demonstrated affection the other cheek of his captive.<br />
&quot;Five minutes left!&quot;  said Magnus with glee.<br />
The two contestants were getting tense. James thought he had to hold on with everything he had, while Ganak felt frustrated. The creature decided to remain calm. If hew played this right, the mortal boy would be his. And he&#39;d make him pay dearly his resistance! What could he do to crack him like an egg. Keeping his cool, Ganak concentrated. Moving all of his arms al once required talent, which he had, but also a collected mind. So he threw all his fingers into a lat-ditch attach upon poor James. His skin got assaulted from everywhere! The places which had shown tickling promise were now besieged. His belly fat was squeezed. His toes forced upward to allow nails to scratch them and his feet arches and feet balls poked and glided upon by fingers. The center of his belly was brushed tenderly, just as were the crook of his armpits, along with being the focus of concentric, playful little circles. His ribs were poked by excited fingers and his neck peppered by Ganak&#39;s little kisses, taunting him to let go and throwing little coos too. He blew loud raspberries there too. But the worst were his hands digging into his diaper. His butt cheeks got patted, lightly tapped, brushed and his penis felt a long finger gliding almost amorously along its length. As for his testicles... Ganak tickled them playfully with one hand and another pressed from downside with fingers by intermittence with the dexterity of an accomplished pianist. All these gestures were loving, caressing, playful and teasing. James could feel those feeling emanating from Ganak and it gnawed at his resolve. Certainly for treating him in such a caring way, could the creature be that bad? With a last peppering of kisses at the neck and feather-like brushes at his feet, James let a giggle escape and then he laughed openly. There were just two minutes left and Ganak roared in victory. Magnus and his wives were disappointed but a game was a game and they had lost. Ganak felt very proud and decided to make good on his promise to James.<br />
<br />
Now that James could laugh, Ganak tickled him with less mercy, insisting he&#39;d make good on his promise. Now armed with actual feathers, he tickled James until he was holding a true twitching, sobbing mess in his arms that could barely breathe. Ganak helped the others in creating the potion and when it was forced to James&#39; lips, he could oppose no form of resistance. He gulped everything and if at first he was relieved to be returned to human form, unfortunately for him it didn’t last long. He was then sucked into a vial prepared for that purpose, a congealed fog within, reduced to the bare essence of his soul. Any creature swallowing it would find himself or herself pregnant with a baby with James&#39; soul or sperm with his soul, depending upon what they wanted or could have. James was tailored to fit any of his new parents&#39; desire, a rarity that made the price of his soul extremely high. But as a last way to mock him, Ganak had made sure that whoever or whatever he turned out to be, James would be certain to be extremely ticklish. A simple detail and condition that was sure to not deter prospective parents at all. Quite the contrary. As for James, in that state, he was only dimly aware of his surroundings, everything coming as muffled and very hazy. As such, he just slunk back into a deep slumber, too tired to be scared and angry, as he felt the phial containing him be slipped by Ganak into his front pocket, pat it affectionately and almost in fatherly way with jovial chuckle and say he best be on his way. Before drifting again in sleep, James cursed the two minutes he had still to hang on to and worried about who would purchase him for adoption.</p>
