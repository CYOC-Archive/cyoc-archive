<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I&#39;m not sure how long it was that we laid with each other, nuzzling and sniffing, licking each other&#39;s fur with tender longing, but eventually, our hormones, adrenalin, and pheromones slowed, and we changed back to our human forms.  We still stayed tightly wrapped around each other, but the immediate temptation to fuck and change once more was gone, the powerful orgasms she&#39;d given me having sated my inner wolf for the moment. <br />
<br />
Now, however, I had more pressing thoughts. All of them could be said to be mine, but they were accented and augmented by the awakened werewolf side of myself that I&#39;d wished into being. I suppose that I could have wished myself back to being a normal human girl and prevented everything that would happen later, but I didn&#39;t want to. This was my greatest wish-to become a she-wolf. And now, I was prepared to live with the consequences of that wish, of the dark and primal thoughts and desires that coursed through my psyche. It was the part of me that wanted more. To make a pack. To change the world. And to do that, I needed to make more wishes. I had world-shaping power. Thanks to this ring, I was for all intents and purposes, a god. Alicia kissed my neck, and her hand began to slide lower, between my thighs. Her fingertips found my labia and parted them, and she slipped one inside of me. I could feel myself getting wet again, tempted to change once more. I couldn&#39;t have this distraction right now. I needed to concentrate. There would be time for this and more soon.<br />
<br />
“I wish you were home, in bed, and that this was nothing more than a deep and exciting wet dream for you, and that you are just a human again.” There was a soft pop, and then she wasn&#39;t in the room with me. I was alone once more. There was the barest regret as I made the wish; I&#39;d been powerfully attracted to her. Thanks to seeing her, I&#39;d been inspired to make wishes that had awakened me to what I&#39;d always wanted to be. But right now, she was a distraction. I couldn&#39;t have a distraction.<br />
<br />
“I wish I was truly immortal and invulnerable to harm from any source. I wish that no weapon, no disease, nor person, animal, or natural force could harm me in any way, shape, or form,” I said. I felt power, cosmic and ancient, fill me. I was divine. It was almost overwhelming; the only reason it didn&#39;t destroy me from its purity was because I&#39;d wished it. Or had I always been this, simply needing to be awakened? The thought distracted me as I realized that perhaps I&#39;d discovered a paradox, or maybe even caused it. I was a goddess now, but deities ALWAYS were and ALWAYS would be. That would mean it was always destined for me to get this ring; things had been in place over time, and my awakening was inevitable. In the end, it didn&#39;t matter. I was now one of the deities who controlled this world. There had been other deities, ones whose dominance and guidance had shaped epochs. Until this moment, we had been in the era of the Abrahamic. But with this new development, we were now at the start of a new epoch, one ready to dawn. MY epoch.<br />
<br />
I paused and considered things for a moment. My body was coursing with power. I was no longer Joella, the lesbian schoolgirl with a fantasy. My fantasy was reality, and I was far more than a simple girl. It was distracting. My pussy was throbbing with need and desire as I made my wishes and thought of more. My every word was changing things and would continue to do so. But deities made sacrifices to make their will manifest, and I was no different. It was the commitment of god to the world. And so I gave up the one thing that had been so much an essential part of myself since I could remember: my sexuality.<br />
<br />
“I wish that everyone, including myself, was actively bisexual to some degree.” I trembled as new memories began to implant themselves in me. I remembered crushes on guys, and even my first kiss with a boy (something I&#39;d never done before becoming a goddess). While I was still a virgin, as far as time with males went, it didn&#39;t turn me off. In fact, I could remember masturbating to transformation scenes of male werewolves as well. It didn&#39;t change my history or my memories TOO drastically, but it altered them nonetheless. I still preferred women, and by a large degree. But I wouldn&#39;t turn down a man..if he was the right man, and if the urge struck me. To some, this would barely be considered a sacrifice, but this was an essential part of who I was, and I gave it up to reshape the world.<br />
<br />
“I wish that any human who tasted or accepted either precum or cum from any werewolf, male or female, would be instantly infected and transform. I wish that anyone who was bitten  by a werewolf would instantly transform. I wish that their transformations would be as pleasurable as mine. I wish that I could force any werewolf to change, and that all of them would be submissive to me sexually in either form, and utterly obedient in their werewolf forms. I wish that any werewolf could transform day or night with sexual stimulation, either by themselves or from another person. I wish that the full moon would make a transformation inevitable, but that it could be resisted for a short period of time, as long as the werewolf isn&#39;t looking right at it. I wish that the sensation of their genitals transforming would be the most powerfully pleasurable experience a werewolf could have, and that further stimulation from touch or toy or tongue or sex during the change would make it more pleasurable still.”<br />
<br />
With each wish, I could feel the energy thrum through me, and scatter out into the world, seeding the world with my power and my rules. “I wish that anyone I bite becomes larger and more muscular than the average werewolf, and anyone who I turn sexually becomes more generously endowed and gifted with overly-strong pheromones that aid in the seduction of humans.”  The ones I personally selected would be my betas,  my generals in my war to remake the world, and they needed things to set them apart from the rest. But I wanted this particular ability-to make stronger than normal werewolves- to rest with me.  * I * was the goddess. * I * was the alpha. <br />
<br />
“I wish that even a kiss from me would be enough to infect a human with lycanthropy,” I said, musing a bit as one of my hands found its way to my breast and massaged absentmindedly.  I glanced out the window, not even thinking about the fact I was still naked from my wonderful sexual encounter earlier, and peered down at the road below. I watched  the people walking, going about their day, and couldn&#39;t help but pinch my nipple as I pictured all of them in the throes of transformation. I was already getting wet again; my libido was in overdrive now that I&#39;d assumed my destined mantle, that of a sexually driven werewolf goddess. “And I wish that simply the sight of my pussy would captivate any woman and drive her into a state of arousal.”<br />
<br />
Of course, there was the problem of my age. Well, I suppose that now I was immortal, it was less a problem of my age, and more a problem of how I appeared. I still looked like a teenager, and even my ID would still say as much. And despite the fact that since I was a goddess, the term “teenager” was relative, it still could raise an issue for a lot of people, and understandably so. “I  wish that the outward world would see me as a twenty two year old woman.” While nothing physically changed about me, it would prevent a certain amount of the perverts of the world who &#39;liked them young&#39; to focus on me. Admittedly, it was a small percentage, but I had always been a firm believer that those sorts of people were disgusting. I still looked exactly the same, but I was obviously an of-age woman. <br />
<br />
My thoughts turned to Alicia, who had inadvertently been a part of my testing of the ring, and who had indirectly led me to being THIS. I&#39;d wished her away, and now, thanks to my most recent wish, we wouldn&#39;t encounter each other again. I had graduated school four years earlier. I had memories of it. I wanted to see Alicia again at some point, but now she&#39;d still be 16, and have never met me. In fact, those new memories were overwriting the old ones and conflicting a bit.<br />
<br />
“I wish Alicia was twenty two as well, and that she recognized me from the wet dream she had of us transforming,” I said. “And I wish she would seek me out and allow me to transform her once more.”<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t help myself as I grew lost in the fantasy of fucking Alicia again. The fingers on my left hand pinched and tugged at my nipple, and the fingers on my right hand strayed lower, beginning to explore below my waist.  I looked down at the street, watching men and women pass by, and again, I visualized how they might look in the light of a full moon, shedding their human guises.<br />
<br />
I could feel a boiling need inside me as I forced my hands to stop for a moment. It wasn&#39;t just a need for sex. It wasn&#39;t just a need for an orgasm. It was a need to transform someone. I was a werewolf goddess, and my purpose was to reshape the world. It was my destiny to unleash this onto the planet, and it was meant to start sooner, rather than later. I knew I could unwish it. It was as simple as that due to the ring, but I didn&#39;t want to. I could put myself back in control of my urges with a few words. But I had no intention of doing that. This was what I was meant to be, and I liked the loss of control, even as maddening as my growing lust was. It was my true nature, awakened, empowered, and reshaped by the ring.<br />
<br />
“I wish someone would knock on my door in one minute&#39;s time,” I said. I was leaving the wish open-ended. It was a deliberate choice; I liked the unknown. Of course, it was inevitable that they&#39;d be turned by me, but I didn&#39;t necessarily want to wish for a specific person or type of person, at least not this time. <br />
<br />
I slipped on a loose-fitting top with spaghetti straps, and some comfy cotton shorts. I didn&#39;t bother with panties or a bra; there seemed little point. Even if (for some unknown reason) we didn&#39;t end up having sex, I was going to make myself change so I could turn them. I wandered downstairs and sat on the couch in the living room, waiting for the knock.</p>
