<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That&#39;s when you realized that you were nearly late for your morning class! You quickly throw on the closest clothes that fit you as your normal clothes now seemed to be too tight fitting. You run out of the house wearing a large t-shirt and, oddly enough, your mum&#39;s yoga pants that seemed TOO conveniently placed next to your bed, but you didn&#39;t even think about it at all. It didn&#39;t even occur to you that never woke Grace, Lucy, or even Katie as they had classes as well. You figure it was probably for the best to let them rest their pudgy bodies after their session with daddy last night.<br />
<br />
By the time you get to the campus, the running had caused your cock to rub vigorously against your leg, which in turned raised it into an impressive mast that made a less than subtle tent in your yoga pants, leaving very little to the imagination of a few students you passed by.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, you were able to make it to class on time with only a minute to spare. Even more fortunate, your classmates seemed to be too preoccupied with their own conversations to notice you walking in with a full on erection.<br />
<br />
You take your seat in the front row of the class, feeling a bit anxious now. Anxious not because of your obvious erection you were a bit oblivious to, but rather when you can spend time with your daddy again. Little did you know it would be a lot sooner than you realized.<br />
<br />
A few more minutes passed, causing some of the students including yourself to question where the professor was. As if on cue, you hear a familiar porcine grunt emanate from the lecture room door, drawing everyone&#39;s attention to the cloud of what appeared to be vapor spewing forth from it. With a few heavy steps, the one who made the grunt make himself known to the class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Quite a few of the students looked in confusion at your exclamation while others snickered at the implication you just made about yourself.<br />
<br />
But the fact was quite true: Trevor stepped into the room, dressed in what appeared to be an old, ill-fitting set of tweed pants and jacket, a stained white dress shirt underneath clearly showing strain as the stressed buttons were just barely containing his Hogbrew belly. He had a pair of dirty glasses that were clearly non-prescription, though you knew this on a personal level. In his hand was the source of the misty cloud: a decently large sized vape pen labelled, &quot;Hogvapor&quot; still leaking its vapor from the mouth piece as it trailed behind him. In the other was a bag with what you spotted to be even more of the same vape pens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright class! My name is Trevor, but you can call me Professor Trevor. &#39;Daddy&#39; works to for some of you~&quot; he announces, winking at you at the last statement, causing the some students to look on in confusion, some in disgust, a few more chuckling, and you shooting pre into your yoga pants. &quot;I&#39;m sure y&#39;all are wondering where your regular professor is at. Let&#39;s just say... I met him along the way and convinced him to let out a bit of stress for the day...&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, one of the math instructors stepped inside the faculty office to prepare for his later classes when an odd stench came into contact with his nose. That&#39;s when he realized the whole area was enveloped in a heavy fog, the source coming from your professor and a few others, looking a bit more porcine as they masturbated each other while adding to the haze with their own vape pens.<br />
<br />
The math instructor wanted to turn around and leave in disgust, but found that he couldn&#39;t resist the enticing smell of the vapor as his eyes glazed over, his nose becoming flatter and upturned, and an erection in his pants, causing him to drop his bag full of lecture notes and equations, adding to the paper mess already on the floor...<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Trevor let out another puff of Hogvapor towards the class causing most of them to cough and wave the air in a futile attempt to clear it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir? *cough cough* Aren&#39;t vape pens and other inhalants prohibited inside campus buildings?&quot; one of the students asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heheh! Well that may be so, but I&#39;m the professor here so I know what&#39;s best for the class. Makes sense, right?&quot; Trevor says with another exhale of vapor, filling the entire room with a light cloud of the stuff. It appeared some of the more intellectual minds wanted to object, but their expressions looked a bit dumbfounded the more they inhaled the Hogvapor into their minds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I guess that makes sense...&quot; another student replied as her eyes glazed over and her ears a bit longer and pointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? I knew I had a class of smart little piglets like yourselves! Let&#39;s get today&#39;s lesson started then shall we?&quot; he says, turning to the whiteboard. He then turns back, giving you a seductive look. &quot;Of course, a teacher&#39;s going to need his pet to assist him, won&#39;t he?&quot; he asks you with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes daddy! Right away!&quot; you say eagerly, happy to be with daddy again. There are a few more giggles that come from the class, though they now sound more amused and simple rather than jeering.<br />
<br />
For the next two hours, Trevor began lecturing to the class about the history of pig men, a quick rundown of their anatomy and as much information he could provide within the time. You had started out by passing out vape pens to everyone in class as he encouraged everyone to huff more Hogvapor as a part of class participation. After that, he called you over for a &#39;special assignment&#39; consisting of you underneath his desk, blowing and worshiping his meaty cock, causing the stain on your tent to grow larger and darker.<br />
<br />
It was clear he wanted to keep you to himself, letting the changes slowly stew inside of you as opposed to the rest of the class at the moment. Everyone else was now in dumbfounded trances as the Hogvapor they were inhaling were allowing Trevor&#39;s &#39;lecture&#39; to absorb completely into their minds, as well as their memories. It was also clear that the vapors where changing them physically as like the student earlier, ears became pointed or floppy, noses upturned, and curly tails ripping free out of every pants.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, it seemed that every pants also began forming tents like yours... even for the female students. Yes, it seemed even the most feminine of your lady classmates began losing their cup size in exchange for cock girth. Soon, every student in class were absent-mindedly pumping their dicks for pleasure as they lost themselves in Trevor&#39;s porcine information.<br />
<br />
Soon, the class bell rang and class was dismissed, causing the room full of now chubby pig men to slip their erections back into their ill-fitting pants as they waddled out with Hogvapor pens in hand and Trevor packing more into their bags at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now remember piglets! These vapors will keep you feeling like nice piggies only for a little bit. So when you feel you need to pig out again or help others to pig out, huff some more Hogvapor!&quot; Trevor told the porcine students as they were about to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Professor Trevor! Oink!&quot; they said in unison like obedient school children.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the last horny pig man left with his tail swinging lazily above his skirt, leaving you and Trevor behind in the empty classroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heheh! You were a mighty fine help today as teacher&#39;s pet, Jay!&quot; Trevor said, patting your head and rubbing your clothed erection at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hee hee! Thanks daddy!&quot; you reply happily, your smile and upturned nose lined with his cum.</p>
