<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ben, would you take off your shirt for $100?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, $100?&quot; Ben said. &quot;Yeah sure!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dropped his glove, unbuttoned his jersey and tossed it away.  <br />
<br />
Kyle reached into Mr. Smith&#39;s wallet and pulled out a crisp $100 bill. And passed it to Ben.  Ben grabbed the cash and stuffed it in his pocket.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Ben, that farmer&#39;s tan isn&#39;t good.&quot; Kyle said.  Ben blushed a bit.  &quot;From now on, you&#39;ve got perfect golden brown skin with no tan lines.&quot; Ben&#39;s skin tone changed to a deep brown and his acne scars faded into nothingness.   It looked great  with his dirty blonde hair.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Thanks!&quot; Ben said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now Ben, would you take off your pants for another $100? Don&#39;t be bashful.&quot; Kyle said the words easily, extending his payment. <br />
<br />
Ben didn&#39;t hesitate.  He wasn&#39;t ashamed of his body. He took the cash and stuffed it in his pocket beforeHe pulling  off his trousers and looking at himself in the mirror.  There he stood in his athletic supporter with his ass to a lot of the senior athletes of the school.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ben, you have a lot of confidence.  It must come from your great physique, those pecs and abs, man you&#39;re ripped.&quot; Kyle said.  <br />
<br />
Ben&#39;s stance relaxed even more and Kyle watched as he bounced his pecs a bit and flexed one of his arms slightly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ben,&quot; Kyle said, &quot;I&#39;ll give you the rest of the money in this wallet, about $2000 if you&#39;ll let me change your last name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To what?&quot; Ben said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dover&quot; Kyle said with a smirk.  <br />
<br />
&quot;$2000 for a joke of a name? Of course.&quot; Ben said laughing.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Your name has always been Benjamin Dover.&quot; Kyle said with a laugh.  <br />
<br />
Ben now remembered having always had the last name Dover.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now Ben,&quot; Kyle said, &quot;Would you take off your jockstrap if I gave you a new car?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Ben hesitated.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll give you your dream car if you take off your jock.&quot; Kyle said. &quot;You can even cover yourself with your glove if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben picked up the glove he had dropped to unbutton his shirt and put it on his left hand. Then, positioning it in front of his cup, he tugged down the garment with his right hand, wobbling a bit, he pulled it off his legs. He passed the garment to Kyle&#39;s outstretched hand.   <br />
<br />
Kyle took the jockstrap. Then he said, &quot;Your dream car is in the driveway.&quot; A big black truck with the license plate &quot;Ben&#39;s Toy&quot; was now in front of the house.  <br />
<br />
Kyle tossed the jockstrap to Mr. Smith who pulled the cup out of the pouch and pressed it to his nose.  The clown nose honked as he huffed the scent.  &quot;He must really love your musky, manly odor.&quot; Kyle watched as Mr. Smith pulled the pouch of the jock over his cock and began to furiously pump.  After what seemed like mere moments, Mr. Smith came, this time shooting a sticky load instead of confetti into the fabric.  <br />
<br />
There was a jostling of people from another room and all of a sudden Benson came bounding out dragging Joey behind him on his leash.  He grabbed the jockstrap with his teeth and pulled it away from Mr. Smith with a playful growl.  Then he had it on the floor and was stretching and pulling the used garment, lapping and gnawing at it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bad dog!&quot; Shouted Mr. Smith, the cup muffling his voice as he huffed and lapped at it himself.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No wait, this might be a good lesson for the bad boys in the room.&quot; Kyle said.  &quot;Benson, for the next five seconds you can talk like a person to everybody but Ben.&quot;<br />
<br />
Benson cried out the jock still hanging from his jaw, &quot;Oh God make it stop! This is hell. He&#39;s a monst-&quot; &quot;That&#39;s enough. Go outside with your new toy.&quot; Kyle commanded.  <br />
<br />
The dogman pulled Joey to the door as Joey said a quiet, &quot;Sorry Mr. Kyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What a rambunctious dog!&quot; Ben said laughing, oblivious to the horror show everyone else had witnessed.  <br />
<br />
Kyle turned back to Ben, &quot;You&#39;re still covering up that awesome package of yours after all that commotion? I thought you were proud to show off that monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben dropped the glove revealing a greatly enchanced member that dangled pendulously before him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Kyle said, that must be a whopping 10 inches.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ben grew a bit more.  <br />
<br />
Kyle said, &quot;Ok Ben, I&#39;ve given you over $2000 dollars in cash and a new car.  What do you want to do when you graduate high school?&quot; Kyle said, making sure that he didn&#39;t ruin Ben&#39;s life.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Ben said, his arms still on his hips as he turned to face Kyle, &quot;I haven&#39;t really thought much about it.  I figured I would play a little baseball in college and then decide once I was there for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle said, &quot;If you let me age you ten years, I&#39;ll make sure you are completely set and never have  to work a day in your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben said, &quot;Ten years is an awful lot but I&#39;ll<br />
never have to work?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be set.&quot; Kyle said.  <br />
<br />
Ben thought for a bit longer than he had for any of  Kyle&#39;s other suggestions.  But eventually he decided. &quot;You haven&#39;t steered me wrong yet! Sure!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle said, &quot;You&#39;re 28 years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben aged a decade.  His face lost its boyishness and took on a bit more manly shape.  His muscles filled out a bit more and the light dusting of hair on his chest darkened and thickened.  Though it was light, it was possible to see a five o&#39;clock shadow form on his face.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Lookin good man! You&#39;ve aged well. Even though I bet you&#39;re still as horny as a teenager.&quot; Kyle said with a grin.  <br />
<br />
Ben&#39;s cock sprung to life jutting straight out in front of him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Final question,&quot; Kyle said.  What if I told you you could live in a mansion this awesome with a pool and people who wanted to meet every one of your needs.  Having as much sex as you want, doing whatever you want, but you had to have a husband and take a hyphenated last name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A hyphenated last name? Why would that matter? You&#39;re saying that I could have as much sex as I want, do whatever I want and have a husband that was completely devoted to me?&quot; Ben sounded excited.  <br />
<br />
The rest of the guys in the room exchanged glances, not knowing that Ben was gay.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes of course.&quot; Kyle said, his plan finally coming together.   He could help Ben and still make others miserable.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds great!&quot; Ben said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ben it must be nice living here controlling all of the finances of the house, having Mr. Smith doing everything he can to get you off, having his hot son here, and his two servants.  You must be living like a king. Remember that a king rules his castle.  Loves his subjects, and takes what he wants when he wants it. I guess it&#39;s only right to introduce you as Ben Dover-Smith.&quot;<br />
<br />
A wedding band appeared on Ben&#39;s finger.  Kyle laughed to himself knowing that from now on, he would get to see Ben, this good guy,  living it up on Jake&#39;s earnings.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like the name? Why don&#39;t you say it for yourself?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ben looked at his husband, the man had thrown this whole party for Blake.  He looked dumb in his clown paint but he could still see in him the man that loved him absolutely and unconditionally.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ben Dover-Smith&quot; he said to himself softly. <br />
<br />
In an instant, Mr. Smith was on his knees with his ass up in the air.  <br />
<br />
Kyle laughed as he watched Smith seek to comply with the command that was his husband&#39;s full name.   <br />
<br />
Ben looked at Kyle again.  &quot;Thanks for everything!&quot; He said with a grin, not realizing that his desires and intentions had been completely warped by this nerdy freshman.  <br />
<br />
Kyle said, &quot;Of course, your welcome. Oh, I know that you don&#39;t normally wear clothes around the house and only really get dressed to work out or go into town but, since this is a bit of a costume party, why don&#39;t I give you an outfit befitting your status in this house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; Ben said.  <br />
<br />
Kyle snapped his finger and Ben, this towering golden god of a man was now wearing a crown, an open gilded robe and a gold bikini style underwear.  Ben took his spot in Mr. Smith&#39;s abandoned chair.  <br />
<br />
Then he nodded to his husband and said, &quot;Honey, get up off the floor and get our guests some refreshments I think Blake is coming down.&quot; Mr. Smith hopped up and began distributing drinks and snacks as Blake came downstairs in his costume.  <br />
<br />
Ben and Kyle looked over at the slut.  He was wearing a cheap looking turban and a pair of low cut shorts with a dull plastic sword attached at the hip.  His shirt was a midriff bearing white t that said &quot;Sword Swallower&quot; on it.  <br />
<br />
Ben said to Mr. Smith, &quot;That&#39;s what you got for your son to wear?&quot; He just got a hurried nod in return as Smith tried to pass out the rest of the snacks and drinks.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Come over here boy and unwrap the present your step-daddy got you.&quot; Ben said with a gesture to his crotch brimming with absolute confidence and control.  <br />
<br />
&quot;My favorite!&quot; Blake said pulling down the broefs and engulfing the hot rod in front of him.  <br />
<br />
Kyle shifted his attention away from his good work he had done for Ben and focused on getting his next victim.</p>
