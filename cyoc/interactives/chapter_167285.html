<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dion realized that tomorrow was not coming quickly enough.  His lower half was almost all girl, and his room was changing.  He started to run his hands through his hair in worry, noting it was just a little bit longer.   It covered most of his ears now, and he instinctively pushed it behind his ears.  Then he realized what he did.  <br />
Maybe the neighbors could help?  No, what would he do, ask for boxers or a pair of jeans?  Besides, he would just become his neighbors.  He was lucky enough the torn jeans let him turn back into him.  Thinking about that, he realized that someone had to have worn them at some point.  Maybe there is a time limit for how long clothing had been worn that led to a reset?<br />
He couldn&#39;t do anything until late tonight.  He took another deep breath and realized he had to do something in the morning.  Hopefully not to much would change between now and then.<br />
Just as he was thinking about that his father yelled up the stairs saying that dinner was ready.<br />
Holly rushed down the stairs just a little before Dion.  Dion caught a glimpse of himself in the bathroom mirror on the way down the hall.  His shirt was now a light pastel purple, rather than white.  His hair was a little lighter now too.  Shaking his head, and then feeling the extra hair movement, he went downstairs.<br />
The family was at the table eating.  Lasagna night was one of Dion&#39;s favorite meals.  It was one of the few things that Holly agreed with Dion about.<br />
While he was eating, he noted his arms were a little thinner when he was getting his second helping.  He also saw that his nails were a little more...shiny?  After he had a few bites of this second plate of dinner, he touched his nails and felt some kind of coating.  He kept on pushing his hair behind his ears.  Holly was taking a few extra looks at Dion over dinner.  Sometimes she seemed to be squinting at something.<br />
&quot;Dion, sweetie, do you need a hair tie for your hair?  I know you wanted to grow it out, but it will end up in your food at this rate.  It&#39;s down to your shoulder, honey,&quot; suggested his mom.<br />
&quot;it&#39;s OK mom, I&#39;ll take care of it after dinner,&quot; replied Dion, as he scratched his chest through his purple t-shirt.<br />
&quot;Suit yourself&quot;<br />
The family had a little bit of a storemade cake for dessert and went their separate ways.  <br />
Dion went straight back to his room, not stopping when Holly called his name once in the hall.<br />
His room had some major changes since he went down for dinner.  His desk had some makeup supplies and some drawers, his bedframe was white and his closet was full of pastel colors.  His shoes were now a mixture of flip flops and sneakers, and even one pair of small wedges.  The carpet was a similar purple to his shirt.  He now had a poster about &quot;A wrinkle in time&quot; and something about a high school musical?    His underwear drawer now had girl&#39;s underwear.<br />
There was a knock at his door.  &quot;Dion, it&#39;s Holly, are you ok?&quot;<br />
Dion licked his lips, and noted they tasted like cherries.  He reached into his pocket and noted he had a tube of lip gloss that was cherry flavored.  After looking at his hand, he eye moved to his chest.  There were now 2 bumps on it that he could make out through his shirt.  He hopped a little, and they moved a little.<br />
&quot;Holly, I&#39;m fine!&quot; yelled Dion in a voice that was slightly higher than at dinner.  <br />
He heard footstep moving down the hall.<br />
With slow steps, Dion walked to the mirror that was now in his room.  He looked at himself.  He was wearing a purple t-shrt with the word &quot;happy&quot; on it, his jeans now were tight against his skinnier legs and his socks had ruffles.  His shoes were pink sneakers.  His hair was going down his back and he had lips that were redder because of the gloss.  He had some curve to him his hip, and his chest.  He took off his shirt slowly, feeling the shirt pull on his breasts slightly.  They bounced back into position and he stared at them in the mirror.  At least before the jeans he didn&#39;t have to worry about these.  He saw his nipples where a little bigger and the part around them seemed a bit darker and bigger.  Without really thinking, he touched on and then recoiled his hand.   <br />
Dion fell back on his bed, rolled the covers around him, cried a little then fell asleep</p>
