<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">  Hiking up the mountain wasn&#39;t the easiest thing in the world thought Issac. For one, despite Issac&#39;s almost complete resistance to both heat and cold, the high altitude of the mountain range chilled Issac to his very Corrupted cold and even Marry, a native of this plane barely managed to last only slightly longer than Issac did. Only through use of his magma breath did the three manage to have atleast some warmth as they climbed higher and higher, watching the plant life diminished. as they progressed.<br />
<br />
    The entire travel there took about three days, and had left the entire party exhausted. Regardless they continued, Issac didn&#39;t want to spend another second letting the tyrannical Cloud King to get away with his corrupt deeds, and so they continued.<br />
<br />
       By the time it was around noon, the three found themselves taking a break at a small plateau on the cloud mountain.<br />
<br />
      Issac, looking around for any signs of danger, while Ilvir was watching the distant horizon from a ledge, the sun casting a rich light over the white landscape, making everything almost blindingly bright.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Quite the sight, do you two have anything similar on your world?&quot; Marry said, smiling at the sights around them.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Something similar, though not nearly as bright.&quot; Issac said chuckling.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Do you have any Pegasi on your world as well?&quot; <br />
<br />
  &quot;Not to my knowledge, speaking of which, we haven&#39;t seen so much as a feather yet, should we be expecting any yet?&quot;  Issac , glancing over the plateau for any signs of a Pegasus.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Dont worry about it, Issac, any moment now I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find a herd, these mountains are known for being populated with numerous groups of pegasi, so just keep your eyes peeled and we&#39;ll find one before you know it.&quot; <br />
<br />
  And of course, Marry was right. It had only been about half an hour before they had found themselves on another flat mesa before they heard the sounds of roaring hoof beats, growing louder and louder until they all looked up and saw, dozens of meters above them, flying on brilliant feathered wings, was a herd of pegasi. They were all the epitome of magnificene, each one a brilliant stallion, ranging from colors of a deep sunset orange to a bright sky blue, each step in the sky causing a thundering sound as they flew. At the front of the flying herd was the leader. <br />
<br />
     A large gray stallion twice the size of any other average pegasus, and most notable by it&#39;s wonderous iridescent mane which sparked in a rainbow of colors in the sunlight.<br />
<br />
    Issac, Ilvir, and Marry hiding behind a large rock face saw the herd fly down onto the mesa, each one landing with a large thud that shook the cloudy earth beneath them.<br />
<br />
  Then the herd started to spread out, starting to graze upon the cloudly material of the mountain itself.<br />
<br />
   They had not seen them yet. Good. Issac thought, that means they could potentially pick them off one by one.<br />
<br />
   Looking over to Ilvir who stood beside Issac like a child, almost hugging him with his arms as the Ilvir looked back up at his creator.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Ilvir, can you still cast divine magic?&quot; Issac asked. <br />
<br />
   &quot;Hmm, I believe so, although channeling divine energy will be much harder on this plane compared to the material one.&quot; Ilvir asnwered after a brief pause.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Alright then, can you cast a sphere of silence around us? It doesn&#39;t have to completely mute out sound, just enough so that the any of those pegasi don&#39;t notice us.&quot; Issac asked.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Of course Master.&quot; Ilvir said before closing his eyes. Channeling divine magic, Ilvir&#39;s arms themselves almost seemed to distort before a bright light emanated from his hands. Marry watched with wonder at Ilvir&#39;s spell casting before he completed it. <br />
<br />
  Marry was about to gasp inamazement but when she did,  barely any sound came out, the spell had taken affect.<br />
<br />
  After confirming that for himself, Issac nodded at the two before peeking out of the rock. Looking at the winged horses, he immediately felt himself getting aroused as he examined them from a distance. Mostly looking at the huge members that hung from the males&#39; bodies. He couldn&#39;t tell which one to draw over, but decided to start small. <br />
<br />
    In the corner, nearly isolated was a thin looking blue pegasus, no doubt the outcast of it&#39;s herd. Poor thing, come here and I will show you unbound lust thought Issac as the pink tips of both his members were starting to poke out from their sheaths.<br />
<br />
   Activating his lust gaze, he stared solely at the first pegasus, willing it to come closer. It took several seconds before Issac saw the pegasus&#39;s thing member grow out of its sheath as it made it&#39;s way behind the rock face, completely out of it&#39;s here sights. The stallion was hesitant at first in front of Issac but a quick pat of the head quickly calmed it.<br />
<br />
   Still focusing his lust gaze on the stallion, he willied to to turn around and move it&#39;s tail aside, completely revealing its virgin asshole to Issac, it&#39;s big balls hanging visibly.<br />
<br />
   Issac grew harder, wasting no time as he plunged one of his cocks into the creature&#39;s ass, seeing the creature cry in pain but hearing no sound come out from it&#39;s muzzle.<br />
<br />
   Issac kept thrusting furiously into the horse&#39;s asshole, feeing it&#39;s ass pulsate around his member. At first the horse was violently reacting to the sudden penetration, attempting to escape from Issac but soon enough it too was buckling against Issac, its heavy balls noiselessly slapping against Issac&#39;s. Grinning with satisfaction, Issac began the second part of his plan. The Purple vines that covered Issac&#39;s body began to unravel as in a flash as they exploded out of Issac&#39;s form and around the pegasus, already starting to integrate the creature into Issac&#39;s body. Issac gave out a noiseless roar as he felt the Pegasus&#39;s essence flood into him, as he violently began to reform anew. Now only nasturbating with all four of his hands and both of his dicks was Issac, now carrying the equine features of the pegasus. He had gained about another foot in height and now sported two pairs of wings, one feathered and the other his original pair of wings he gained back in the crypt. Issac&#39;s balls nearly doubled in size as he felt the enhanced testicles churn even more cum at an advanced rate with the addition of the pegasus.<br />
<br />
  Issac grinned as he felt arguably the most important trait he got from the steed. Although it was only slightly noticeable, instead of feeling heavier, Issac instead felt lighter. Not by much, but each step Issac took now was slightly easier to take, each breath not feeling as heavy. <br />
<br />
        Issac grinned as he kept stroking his cocks, Marry and Ilvir watching in the background, Ilvir horny and aroused just by looking at Issac and Marry although she was wearing armor, between her legs, at the grey spot where she would sexually mature and gain a functional vagina, the spot grew a tinge darker.</p>
