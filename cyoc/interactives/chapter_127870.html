<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff grabbed his electronic drawing pad off the shelf, and plugged it into the Chronivac.  It took a minute or so for the new hardware to sync up, and then he started drawing.<br />
<br />
Earlier that day, Jeff had a run in with Barrett (Barrett was his first name, apparently after the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning - his last name was Whitman, and he was anything but poetic).  Big muscular jock had no reason to bully Jeff.  Well, maybe Jeff hadn&#39;t been staring at Barrett, he really wasn&#39;t staring at Barret, he was lost in thought staring off into space, and Barrett came along and filled that space while changing at his locker.  Jeff had tried to explain, but it came out wrong.  But with his tablet, he could redraw the encounter, and change the outcome.  Were that real life were that easy.<br />
<br />
He decided to make his subject and he aware, but the rest of the world would accept the changes as normal.  Jeff didn&#39;t really know what that meant, but he started to draw Barrett Whitman.  The Chronivac scanned the area for the desired subject, and as luck would have it the real Barrett Whitman was in range.  He was a the noisy party in the house next door to Jeff&#39;s.   Jeff started to draw Barrett without pants, as an anatomically incorrect plush bear.<br />
<br />
Barrett was shifting his feet back and forth.  He&#39;d had a couple beers, and was in line for the bathroom.  He could piss outside in the bushes, or in a potted plant (he&#39;d done that before), but he needed privacy to get his roofies ready.  He was getting lucky tonight with Cindy.  He smiled, too bad she probably wouldn&#39;t remember it.  Ah, at last the door opened, and he dashed in locking it behind him.  He undid his belt, and fly, pulled out the baggie of roofies, and let his jeans drop to his ankles. He started peeing.  The stream suddenly trickled out. He reached up to shake his wiener dry, and discovered it was gone.  His crotch was a soft mound of plush fur.  He was scared, and frustrated.  Cindy wasn&#39;t going to ride Barrett&#39;s rod tonight after all.  He reached down to pull up his jeans, but they were gone. So were his socks and shoes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, pooh!&quot; Barrett said.  He slammed his hand over his mouth, that wasn&#39;t the word he meant to say.  He immediately went into a litany of curse words, but what came out was: &quot;Goodness! Fudge! Durn! Pooh! Bother! Golly!  Gosh! Well, I&#39;ll be!&quot;  His entire vocabulary had been sanitized, just like his manhood.  He slammed his fist into his other palm.  It didn&#39;t hurt.  His arms were plush too.  At least he was still wearing his white t-shirt, and black leather jacket.  He stared in the mirror.  He was a cartoon plush anthro Teddy Bear.  &quot;Barrett Bear?  You gotta be -&quot; his mind suddenly clicked.  When he had pounded that wimpy fag Jeff, the dude had gone about how he wasn&#39;t looking at Barrett, he was imagining an anthro plush Teddy Bear- well, Barrett didn&#39;t let him get much farther than that.  He looked at the windowless room, and frowned. He&#39;d have to exit back through the house.  What would people think?  He shuddered.<br />
<br />
He opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bout time, Barrett,&quot; said a cheerleader, as she pushed passed him.  As she closed the door she added, &quot;Next time flush, when you&#39;re done!&quot;<br />
<br />
The door closed.  The toilet flushed.<br />
<br />
No one was staring at the 6 foot tall plush Teddy Bear in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Acid?&quot; he wondered aloud.<br />
<br />
Norm Pesto was standing nearby, and said, &quot;I wish. This party is lame.  Nothing interesting ever happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think maybe someone slipped me acid,&quot; Barrett explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, what&#39;s it like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m a giant teddy bear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s disappointing, because you are a giant Teddy Bear, and always have been. What does it make you think you should be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a guy like you. Like these other guy-uh?  Did you see that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  Over there by Billy, Zach was standing there-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Zack the unicorn, right? Yeah, he&#39;s still there.  The balloons are just blocking your view.  He didn&#39;t disappear.  Really lame acid they slipped you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he wasn&#39;t a unicorn a minute ago.  He was -&quot;<br />
<br />
Others at the party were changing.  Mostly his teammates, and the cheerleaders.<br />
<br />
He needed to get outside.  Get some fresh air or something. He saw the hostess, Mitzi. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mitzi!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Barrett, you having fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Norm interrupted, &quot;Mitz, someone slipped Bearboy some bad acid, and he&#39;s tripping.  He thinks he&#39;s supposed to be human, and so are some of the other guys, like Zach.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s awful. What a boring world it would be, if everyone in it were just human?&quot; Mitzi said earnestly. &quot;I sometimes wish I were a plush.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I better go.  Uh, you wouldn&#39;t happen to know where that scrawny Jeff kid lives, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you must be disoriented.  Jeff lives next door, but he wouldn&#39;t have slipped you drugs because he does do stuff like that. Besides, he has even been here tonight,&quot; Mitzi pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next door?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, the white house with blue trim?  Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he&#39;ll let me crash there for the night,&quot; Barrett said.  He was sure the answers lay with Jeff.</p>
