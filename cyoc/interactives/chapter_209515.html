<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark pondered a bit on the matter but chose to keep Arthur within as gametes within his testicles. Not for long, but enough to find a partner and decide his future life. To have that much control over his bully... It was great! And Mark was not a bad person. Well, not a bad satyr, now. Who knew what Merlin might do to Arthur? And he could ensure Arthur grew up to be a better person. He would be raised right and not be the awful waste of skin and air that he had been.<br />
&quot;I choose for him to be reborn through my terms,&quot; he said.<br />
Merlin&#39;s eyes lit up.<br />
&quot;You have a good soul, truly. The most kind decision. Very commendable. Enjoy your new life! You and your future baby!&quot;<br />
He snapped his fingers and with a puff of smoke, Mark was spirited away to the fay world. He&#39;d have fun there. As for Merlin, his contribution to providing new blood to the fay would be paid with fine fine and delicious food. And he had more customers to transform. Or not. He&#39;d see. He was already happy with the job he&#39;d done so far.<br />
<br />
Mark was discovering his new home. Walking with goat legs, upright was completely natural. It was amazing! And he trotted and jumped with such ease! The weather was warm in that late evening and the landscape was clearly Mediterranean, cicadas singing and breezes caressing his body. The sun was just setting. Mark was happy. But maybe he needed a new name? But which name? Then the wind brought him a whiff of smoke, of roasting meat, of music and laughter. His true people and home! That&#39;s where he belonged! It was a bit far but he could see the light of the fire in the distance. A bit far but the excitement spurred him on. His penis was still large and his testicles massive yet trotting along was not bothersome at all. He didn&#39;t care being naked. And the way his balls swayed... Wow! It was refreshing to let his privates be free on the nude and caressed by the wind. So liberating! He then thought about Arthur.<br />
&quot;Enjoying the ride, Arthur? You&#39;re not the one walking. You&#39;re the lucky one. You&#39;re nice and warm, happily tranquil and just waiting. You lucky rascal,&quot; he laughed.<br />
He then groped his own scrotum and tickled his testicles.<br />
&quot;Feel that? Coochie coochie coo! But do not worry. We&#39;ll find you a body soon. I&#39;m responsible for you now. And I&#39;ll be a great parent. You&#39;ll see. But should I make you be born again as a boy or a girl? I cannot decide? And should you be effeminate? Or in the body of one of those losers you loved to bully so much? Well, I&#39;ll see as I go!&quot; he called out happily as he went down the slope to meet his new people.<br />
<br />
Within Mark&#39;s scrotum, Arthur was fuming. Well, as much as a bunch of gametes ready to be ejaculated could possibly express that he was fuming. He had been transformed into sperm! Sperm! Inside that dweeb&#39;s balls! Ugh! Repulsive! It was horrible and disgusting and too strange for words! And he did not even know whether it was better or not to be ejaculated into a weird creature or in a vial to be played with by that. warlock at the store! Mark&#39;s tickling of his own balls had been strange. It had really tickled him. The many gametes that constituted him, in two different testicles, had swirled around, twitching in compulsive spasms. If all the sperm that made him could have giggled, they certainly would have. They did squirm, even if Mark did not notice it. Arthur still was swaying nonstop as Mark walked, stuck as he was in testicles that swayed freely. And these things were huge! Mark was hung like a horse and his testes were like a bull&#39;s. Arthur filled his testicles fully and when he would have sex, Arthur would come out in an enormous load. He was disgusted just at the thought! And then Mark would decide what he would look like and remember! It was pure torture! It was a nightmare! It had to be!<br />
<br />
Through the hairy skin of Mark&#39;s scrotum let in words that allowed Arthur to guess what was going on. Mark had reached the camp of satyrs and other mythological creatures. He had been happily welcomes and accepted, gorging himself with wine and eating like a famished person. Arthur felt jealous. How long would it take before he could enjoy himself as much? Between finishing being in a womb and growing up, clearly forever! Mark did not mention the human sperm he was hosting in his testicles, though. He was given the new name of Handsome because he fit the bill of a  male satyr hottie, apparently. Between the laughs and happy talks, Arthur fell half-asleep, stuck as he was in the midst of Mark&#39;s groin, between his thighs and paunch which profited amply from the banquets. It was tight and warm, and disturbingly comfortable. Natural, even, to his horror. His multiple self was startled awake as he felt himself jiggle madly and swaying wildly. Music was p;layed and dances expressed themselves in all liberty. And Arthur felt himself being touched, groped, tickled and patted. By both male and female hands and fingers. Oh... Oh! It felt delicious! He had to concentrate on the female hands, even if the male touches excited him more than he would have ever admitted. He felt the temperature rise. The pool of warmth was his signal! The sperm swirled and swam around madly! It was too tight! Too narrow! Arthur wanted to be out! Now! To find an ovum! To be released and spread into a vagina and explore a warm wet womb! To smother the walls of a womb and its eggs with himself! Even if it meant being released disgustingly through the penis of another! <br />
He could finally hear giggles and his scrotum home was finally fondled and tickled by the same constant female hands. Lips, pouty, delicious lips kissed his hairy testicle abode and it felt...great! Arthur knew he should be ashamed but... this was awesome! That girl, whoever she was, was a genius at titillating and teasing privates. She poked, titillated and tickled admirably and Mark, perhaps thinking of his involuntary guest inside his scrotum, encouraged her to tease her more, complimenting her expert ministrations. Arthur felt himself swirl like mad, more than before. He was in ecstasy, his gametes swimming and darting in every direction, begging to be released, waiting only for the penis to get fully ready. And the panting, moans and hardening of Mark&#39;s virile member indicated that it was going to happen. Finally! Mark&#39;s pulse quickened, his heartbeat increased, his sweat drenched everything, including Arthur&#39;s hated temporary abode and the testicles of the new satyr smacked wildly against the vulva and cheeks of his sexual partner. Arthur was overjoyed. He could feel being smacked into great beautiful butt cheeks, firm and soft! Mark, fully aroused and seized by his passion and sexual urges, thrust wildly and repeatedly into the beautiful maenad that had caught his attention. She was fully willing and so curvy! Those wide hips, wonderful buttocks and ample breasts! A dream come true! And he would meet every girl and guy in the camp over time! His erection found its full arousal in the lubricating fluids of the maenad who loved him and showered him with heartfelt compliments. The new recruit was deserving of his name, without a doubt!<br />
And at long last, Handsome, formerly Mark, shot Arthur with a cry of pleasure into his luscious lover. The load was indeed massive and Arthur felt his entire self being propelled into this new body. It felt so good! So pleasurable! To be inside a body, to find the ovum and fertilising it! To penetrate it! To live again! His desire to survive and his simple urges as an enormous group of gametes mingled and he had one idea in mind. Find it. Find the egg. Reach the ovum,. Penetrate it no matter what else happens. His worries as to what Mark might decide became secondary, almost forgotten as he plunged headlong into his new, incredibly more imperious, mission. These worries were merely an afterthought. The number one priority for the millions of gametes that were him was to find the egg and enter it. If he had been less obsessed by his new primitive urges, he would have considered more what Mark would to him as a future infant. But he did not, too hell-bent on more direct demands. Above, he could hear pants and muscles relaxing, orgasms having been fully reached. Kisses were exchanged. But while they rested, Arthur wads on a vital, crucial mission. He could not allow himself to rest! No matter if part of himself was leaking out of a gross unknown woman&#39;s vagina! There was enough of himself to fertilize an egg! Plenty enough. One of his many, many gametes would be appealing enough for it. He had been super popular and handsome in his previous life! So if a woman was stupid and desperate enough to agree to have sex with such a loser, then he&#39;d seduce her egg super easily! The semen he was had to be of top quality, just as his human self. Anything otherwise would be unthinkable. Of course, in his arrogance, he further forgot what Mark was planning for him. Because as he chose his partner, ready to inseminate her, Mark was fully aware as to he could make Arthur be reborn as. He grinned inwardly as he settled upon a decision. Yes! That would be perfect!  <br />
So when Arthur reached the egg, he smothered it with his entire semen being. It took a lot of time but that egg finally saw quality and let in a tiny part of Arthur, absorbing him. Letting go of the gametes that assembled his former self, he settled into the fertilised egg that would become his new body. At last, he could relax and slip into a peaceful sleep, already feeling himself divide into new cells. He could rest and it was most welcome. He could forget he was stuck in the womb of a woman he did not know and swallow his disgust. He had to forget how horrid it was and how repulsive living there for nine months before being expelled through her uterus was. He was alive. It was the most important. And so taken by his most immediate concerns, he forgot that his new body could look like a lot of different things, all thanks to Mark&#39;s whims and that he might not even be aware of it.</p>
