<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jane had just finished watching a run of the mill romantic comedy that would have been called formulaic by any movie critic, but it made Jane feel better. <br />
Finally, she turned off the TV and headed to bed.<br />
Unaware to her, a small rash had appeared on her ankle. <br />
<br />
The next morning was her day off, so she got up late and took a shower. <br />
<br />
“What the?” inquired Jane as she touched the red rash on her ankle. “Great….”<br />
<br />
She pulled off some antibiotic skin cream and applied it to the rash before getting ready for her day.<br />
<br />
She ran to store to get some items, mostly more shampoo and conditioners and food. They where out of her normal products so she a grabbed some different product from the same company. As she was about to leave, she spotted a bath bomb which claims to be new and improved to make skin and smoother. She didn’t believe it; she had tried many products like that before and all failed but a nice soak in the bath tonight did sound good.<br />
<br />
On her way home she filled up her car, shaking her head at the prices. <br />
<br />
She returned home and quickly started what would take most of the rest of the day for her…laundry.<br />
<br />
All in all it was a normal day off.<br />
<br />
What she didn’t know was that everything she touched, be it the shopping cart to the gas pump handle she was spreading the Mermaid Virus.<br />
<br />
She finished her laundry and decided to take a bath, she had to shave her legs anyhow. <br />
<br />
When she got into the bath, her eyes widened a bit. Her legs where smooth…she hadn’t shaved them in a while so they should be overdo but her legs where clean. <br />
<br />
“Strange.” said Jane but let it slide as she enjoyed a nice soak adding a new bath bomb which did fill the air with nice scent if nothing else. <br />
She actually fell asleep in the tub before finally get out of the bath and decided to sleep in her own bed. <br />
<br />
She opened her eyes when the alarm went off and headed to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
She opened her eyes and widened as she looked at her skin, it was smooth and soft looking. She looked over herself, not fully believing it her skin looked great for possible the first time she could remember. <br />
<br />
“Damn, that bath bomb actually worked.” Stated Jane as she looked at her ankle to see her rash had grown a bit and seamed to have puffed out a bit. “Aside from there…I’ll have the doc look at it today.”<br />
<br />
She began to get ready for the day, getting dressed only to curse.<br />
<br />
“Damn…it must have shrunk in the wash.” cursed Jane as she finally got her bra hooked up. Her blouse was also tight making her curse herself as she finally got dressed and headed out the door.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long for her coworkers to notice that Plain Jane actually looked good today.<br />
<br />
“Jane what happened? Are you using a new product?” inquired her pregnant coworker<br />
<br />
“Yes and no, I got this new bath bomb at the store yesterday and it is a miracle worker on my skin.” Stated Jane “Going to go after work to pick up more, as well as some new cloths…I must have placed them in the dryer to high.”<br />
<br />
“Ah…” said her coworker with a nod of her head as both went back to work. <br />
<br />
“Doctor Kline.” Said Jane when she saw one of the doctors for a moment. <br />
<br />
“Yes, Jane.” <br />
<br />
“Whenever you get some free time, can I ask you to look at a rash on my leg, I want to get ahead of anything.” Inquired Jane<br />
<br />
“Not a problem, I think I am booked until we are about to close, so then?” inquired Doctor Kline<br />
<br />
“Works.” Said Jane as she went back to work handing out paperwork and answering calls. Every piece of paper she touched, every time she handed out a pen to have a visitor sign in, or when she took the mail from the mailman, she was spreading the virus. <br />
<br />
As his wife was locking the door and doing the last paperwork, Doctor Kline finally had time to look at Jane’s rash.<br />
<br />
“It just appeared a day or two ago, want to get ahead of it.” Explained Jane, she had seen too many people wait until the last moment to have a doctor look at something.<br />
<br />
“Not a problem.” said Doctor Kline as he had Jane put her foot up so he could look at the rash. It now covered almost a quarter of her right ankle and was very red.<br />
<br />
“It wasn’t that red or big this morning.” stated Jane<br />
<br />
“And it doesn’t hurt? not itchy?” inquired Doctor Kline as he put on some gloves and touched the spot. The flesh had puffed out a bit, but not too far but it was noticeable. <br />
<br />
“Not at all.” Said Jane as Kline nodded his head.<br />
<br />
“Well, I am not sure, could be a lot of things but since it isn’t itchy, and it doesn’t seam to be hurting you.” said Kline “I think some antibiotic creams is about our best route. We will have to keep a close eye on it and if it isn’t better in a day or two we will send a sample to the lab.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” said Jane as she went to put on her shoe only to have some of the flesh fall off her ankle.<br />
<br />
Both her and Doctor Kline’s eyes widened as she sat back down and Kline went to look at her ankle again. The flesh had fallen off but right under it was another layer of flesh. It looked like normal skin, it was even the same color as Jane’s skin but Doctor Kline had been on enough fishing trip to know….that was fish scales. Fish scales growing on Jane’s leg.</p>
