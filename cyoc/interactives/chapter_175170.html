<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I left to give you some time to think.&quot; Ty admitted, smirking. &quot;So?&quot;<br />
<br />
June let out a deep exhale of relief and seemed to relax. She savored the feeling of Ty&#39;s fingers wrapped around her smooth female body. She relished the tightness of his grip, the warm excitement of his clammy palm. She knew he was excited too. Despite everything, she let a warm smile play across her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Ty smirked. He carried June up the stairs and she felt a thrill of sexual excitement as her step son carried her into his bedroom, deftly shut the door... and locked it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God.&quot; She whispered, practically shaking with anticipation. &quot;What are you going to do to me, Ty?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty carried his step mom over to his desk, set her down on top of it, and sat down at the chair. He crossed he elbows on the wooden top and stared at June with an expression of both relief and contemplation on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never imagined you without clothes, you know.&quot; He laughed slightly. &quot;But damn, you&#39;re a nice looking MILF.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah?&quot; June gulped, turning slowly with her arms outstretched to afford the young giant a better look. &quot;D-Do you like me, Ty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate what&#39;s inside.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I mean, you do understand that, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman&#39;s expression fell and she nodded slowly. Regretfully. &quot;I know. M-Maybe we can... move past it... be... friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty blinked and his devious smirk returned. He chuckled in realization and nodded slowly. His expression softened and his face was light and happy. &quot;How are you gonna make it up to me, June?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... however you want me to.&quot; She blushed again, turning away coyly. &quot;I&#39;m completely helpless at this size, aren&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.&quot; Ty stared at her, laughing. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll tell you what. I&#39;ll give you what you want, and maybe what we both want... but you have to work for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
June brightened and nodded. &quot;Anything, Ty! Anything! I think we could really make each other happy... if... well, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was kind of thinking that too on the way back.&quot; He grinned and blushed. &quot;Maybe we have more in common than I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right?&quot; June blurted excitedly. She giggled adorably and nodded. &quot;Yeah. But... no, you&#39;re right. I&#39;ve treated you like shit. So... whatever you think I&#39;ve earned... I-I&#39;ll take it. And then... we&#39;ll call it even?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... it&#39;s going to take more than what I have in mind for you, little miss.&quot; He laughed and poked her stomach with his finger, which she grabbed playfully in her tiny hands and tugged. &quot;Think of it as ongoing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh.&quot; The tiny step mom blushed again, voice taking on a seductive edge. &quot;That sounds intriquing. You gonna... play with me, Ty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humiliate you.&quot; He said deviously. &quot;Change you. Own you. Make you whatever I please whenever I want. Throw your life into chaos? Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds exciting. Fresh. New. Sounds fun!&quot; She admitted, blushing harder. &quot;Whatever it takes to make it up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot; Ty concluded, smirking. &quot;Then let&#39;s start with the many times you ordered me to clean the yard. By hand. With no tools.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot; June repeated nervously, gulping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, fuck.&quot; He laughed. &quot;You&#39;re a lot less unlikeable when you&#39;re being an actual human being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You&#39;ve... you&#39;ve given me a new perspective on things.&quot; June sighed and put her hand on her head, pained. &quot;I guess losing five and a half feet of yourself will do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s give some of it back for good behavior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-&quot; before she had a chance to say anything more, June was suddenly grabbed by a tugging pulling sensation. &quot;Hnnngh!&quot; She grunted, her face contorting into discomfort. She stood and gasped in pain for a few moments but found this second change was nowhere near as uncomfortable as the first. She looked down at herself and sat her legs and feet growing underneath her. Her perspective was rising. She was growing!<br />
<br />
In awe, she stepped back on Ty&#39;s desk and together they watched her growth in complete fascination. To June&#39;s delight, it even started to feel good as inches of her original size soaked back in at a steady rate. In no time, she was standing two feet tall again and held her hands to her mouth in awe-filled excitement. &quot;Oh, this feels amazing!&quot; She said dreamily, grinning wider as Ty reached up and took her enlarging hand in his. He felt her growing, trailed up her arm, and reached around down her back and gripped her waist, watching his fingers slowly part as she expanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh...&quot; Ty sniffed suddenly, blushing. &quot;Is that... what I think it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh.&quot; June trembled again, this time not out of fear. She raised to three feet tall and kneeled down on the desk to steady herself, staring down and watching the process with amazement as she stretched out in perfect proportion. She blushed as Ty suddenly and carefully reached up and cupped her breasts in both hands, holding them softly in his palms and feeling them grow too. She wrapped her arms around the back of his head and giggled as he stared with wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... the first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Ty said excitedly, smiling. &quot;They&#39;re so soft!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you like.&quot; June blushed harder, topping out to four feet tall and suddenly and audibly groaning as she suddenly stopped growing. With a head rush, she staggered slightly and sat on the edge of the desk before Ty, her pussy spread open and her hands bracing her. She opened her eyes, realized her step son was staring at her exposed cooch, and gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;God damn.&quot; Ty blinked. &quot;I didn&#39;t really get a good look when you were tiny sized. D-Do you think I&#39;d fit at this size?&quot;<br />
<br />
June blushed deeper red and gulped. &quot;I-I don&#39;t know. We... we could... could try?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty shook his head suddenly and took a breath, trying to turn cold and stern. The crack of a smile gave away his true feelings.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-All right,&quot; the teen rose suddenly. &quot;You get that cute ass off my desk and... and go put on some of my clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing...&quot; June grinned, genuinely pleased at her petite stature. She was still so small. She loved it.<br />
<br />
She made a show of turning to give the boy a look at her shapely ass and turned to the dresser, shaking her rump as she opened a drawer and pulled out a faded t-shirt. She threw it over her head, giggling at how it was baggy on her, and proceeded to yank out some pants. She quickly tossed them on and realized they were much too wide on her slim hips.<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s jaw dropped as June turned. She looked so fucking cute. Adorable, cute, and sexy as fuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... here.&quot; Ty quickly went to his closet and pulled out a faded cinch-style belt. June took it from his hands, flung it around her waist, and pulled the length snug around her waist. The pants secured, she looked up at Ty and put her hands behind her back together, swaying gently with excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, what&#39;s next?&quot; June smiled sweetly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it.&quot; Ty waved into the air suddenly. &quot;You wanna go clean the yard up together, little miss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, fuck yeah!&quot; June jumped with visible glee. &quot;Let&#39;s do it!&quot;</p>
