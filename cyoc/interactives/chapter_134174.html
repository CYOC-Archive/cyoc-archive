<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heather Green should be happy now. She was finally married to Jeremy, not only the love of her life but a handsome stud of a <i>Syntixisaurus rex</i>. She was finally free from probation and able to leave Animalia. She and Jeremy were enjoying the first part of their globe-spanning holiday on a tropical paradise. And yet, she was a little unhappy with how this trip was going. It might be some minor thing like the way her scales were getting too warm in the sun or how the sand keeps getting everywhere. But Heather was pretty certain that their honeymoon was being shared by too many people.<br />
<br />
She was brooding a bit at the Tiki Bar, nursing a large tropical drink. Even the bar was a bit too crowded with tourists. She understood it was tourist season and there was only going to be more coming. But right now, she felt like she couldn&#39;t turn without bumping into someone. In fairness, she was rather big and her tail did cause her to come in contact with more people than usual. But she was still feeling confined.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Jeremy walked over, holding his own tropical drink. &quot;How&#39;s my beautiful bride?&quot; he asked, sitting next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could be having more fun,&quot; said Heather in a slightly sullen way.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing much,&quot; said Heather, &quot;Just that everybody and their grandmother has invited themselves to our honeymoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not true. Not everyone&#39;s grandmother is here,&quot; said Jeremy with a bit of humor, &quot;Mostly it&#39;s your grandmother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; said Heather, &quot;Doesn&#39;t help that she&#39;s been trying to make herself the sexiest theropod on the beach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have thought you&#39;d have gotten used to Tyra&#39;s antics by now,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;What&#39;s really bugging you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, there&#39;s too many people here. Honeymoons are supposed to be romantic getaways. How am I supposed to feel romance when I can&#39;t swing a dead fish around without hitting someone?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Heather, the others have a right to see the other colonies too,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;I know it&#39;s going to be a bit crowded with Tyra, Rex, the Countess, her consort and his friends, the Five Elements, the other Dinotopians...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t forget Animalia Ambassadoria,&quot; said Heather, &quot;Apparently when they heard about the new schedule for the colony tour, they decided to switch to our schedule for convenience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you liked them,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do, but that doesn&#39;t mean I want to spend all my time with them,&quot; said Heather, &quot;We never get any time for just us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can make our own time,&quot; said Jeremy, &quot;There are places where we can have some privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like where?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear that couples can reserve Lover&#39;s Lagoon for special swims,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
Heather looked at Jeremy with some surprise. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have thought you&#39;d want to do something that daring,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say? You bring out the beast in me,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; said Heather flatly, &quot;How many of those drinks have you had so far?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my second,&quot; said Jeremy. Heather gave him a penetrating stare. &quot;...of this size,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought so. Well, I&#39;m fortunately in the mood for such a swim. So finish up that drink so we can get going,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Lover&#39;s Lagoon was a very popular place for couples, especially Animalian bond mates who were mature enough to have sex. However, since there was still an Edict against public mating, things had to be a bit more regulated for Lover&#39;s Lagoon. At the main desk of the hotel, one can purchase several passes to use special gear, such as jet skis and scuba tanks. Couples can also buy reservations to use Lover&#39;s Lagoon for one private hour. It wasn&#39;t strictly off-limits to those without a reservation as it wasn&#39;t booked all the time. But when couples go to Lover&#39;s Lagoon with signed reservation tickets, anyone there was expected to clear out.<br />
<br />
After getting their reservations, Jeremy and Heather were able to head right on over to the lagoon. The lagoon was certainly as beautiful as it was described. It was well-maintained as no one left their litter here. The water was crystal-clear and rather deep, though there were shelves that swimmers could rest on.<br />
<br />
Jeremy looked around, fidgeting a bit with the drawstrings of his red and black trunks. &quot;So, do you want swim a while or do you want to, er, get down to it?&quot; he asked. His alcohol-induced bravado seemed to be starting to wear off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve spent months getting my body ready for bikini season,&quot; said Heather as she undid the sash of her beach gown, &quot;I&#39;m going to at least show it off before we get busy.&quot; She tossed off the cotton coat that had covered her body. She was left standing in a palm green bikini set. She had definitely worked hard to get to the way she was. Her belly was no longer flabby, but now carved with hardened abdominal muscles. Though some may say that her double-dosing was more responsible for that, but not in her hearing range. The rest of her body was very appealing as well, from her big ass, wide hips, and huge breasts tightly hugged by her swimwear. Heather flexed and posed a bit on the edge of the lagoon. Then she looked over her shoulder and asked, &quot;You gonna get wet, big boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy nodded rapidly and said, &quot;Yeah, yeah, let&#39;s go.&quot; The two <i>Syntixisaurus</i> jumped into the lagoon. They didn&#39;t make quite the same splash as the sauropods. Well, perhaps they did since their bones didn&#39;t have air chambers. But that wasn&#39;t important compared to swimming together. It wasn&#39;t particularly hard, especially since they had longer arms than true theropods. They couldn&#39;t hold their breaths underwater as long as some of the more aquatic Animalians, but they weren&#39;t any worse than humans.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of swimming, Heather and Jeremy swam to one of the shelves that allowed them to sit and still be in the water without it being too high. &quot;So, are you ready for some real honeymoon loving?&quot; asked Heather as she removed her top. Jeremy had seen Heather&#39;s bare breasts on multiple occasions now, but they were extra-appealing today.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we&#39;re overdue some,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smart answer,&quot; said Heather. With a little finagling, their bottoms were removed and Heather hovered slightly over Jeremy. Grasping her hips, Jeremy guided her down until she was impaled on his big dinosaur dick. Heather groaned as she started moving against Jeremy. Underwater lovemaking had quite a few differences from doing it on land. The water added a weightlessness that added to the experience. Jeremy grunted as he made Heather slide up and down on his shaft, making her splash in the water a bit. Heather&#39;s legs were lightly wrapped around Jeremy&#39;s to make sure she didn&#39;t slide off completely. But as she was getting closer, she was plunging farther, causing her boobs to splash quite a bit. Eventually, she dove all the way down as she felt her core squeeze. Jeremy let out a deep growl as he shot his load into his wife.<br />
<br />
The two just sat together, basking in the afterglow. &quot;Well, that certainly made up for the crowding,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you we would get a good honeymoon out of this,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but I want us to have sex like this at each place we visit,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know we&#39;re not going to always be near the water,&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Water, land, doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; said Heather, &quot;It&#39;s our honeymoon and I want to have a sexy encounter at every port.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can arrange that,&quot; said Jeremy.</p>
