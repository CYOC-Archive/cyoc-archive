<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Disappointed and bored Bachiko amused herself with the image of the entire city of Novale as nothing but Cat Girl Maids. Running efficiently, cleanly, perfectly, and everyone in total harmony with everyone else. She knew it was a silly fantasy, if for no other reason than newborns and toddlers couldn't sign a contract to begin with if they couldn't comprehend what they were signing. But it still gave her a sense of satisfaction. <br />
<br />
This had been one of Kupochu's better ideas. Bachiko had figured THIS would finally be a splurge they needed to get Kopuchu's quota of 'lots' of new sisters to maintain the house hold. And Pimiko was right, they would need family members with diverse skills in order to run Master's home properly.<br />
<br />
And they had less than a week to do it. <br />
<br />
There was one mousey girl at the gym who said she'd think it over and she had some friends who might interested in too if they were there the next day. <br />
<br />
&quot;I promise dear we will be.&quot; Pimiko assured her. <br />
<br />
The mousey girl bowed at at least twice before scurrying off.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's already got the right attitude for our family.&quot; Said Bachiko sounding rather satisfied. &quot;She'll be back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miya chose to show off her new body in front of all the other ladies, declaring how it was all thanks to the CGM program. Her acrobatic performance swoon many a woman. All of them looked ready for just one push to make them join. <br />
<br />
However there was a fly in the ointment. <br />
<br />
A blond burly man with a buzz cut came out of an office door over looking the mostly glass building.<br />
<br />
&quot;We better beat paws.&quot; Said Bachiko seeing the big man slowly eye them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You girls coming?&quot; Pimiko asked Miya and Yukiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like duh!&quot; Miya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh let me try and charm him! Could be fun!&quot; Yukiko grinned eyeing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better part of valor dear.&quot; Pimiko said calmly. <br />
<br />
The group decided to leave before the owner of the gym came around and began to wonder what they were doing in his building without permission. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll figure out how to get him to sign a contract tomorrow.&quot; Kopuchu said. Then she could finally prove to master she was a good servant, and she'd have all the staff the household needed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Pimiko suggested they all spend the night at her house. The cat girl maids were already talking about what they'd that evening. Like setting up a trust fund to transfer all their savings to for both the Household, Master, and Family. <br />
<br />
&quot;We should also go through all our old things like I did.&quot; Kopochu said, &quot;Anything that wouldn't be useful or look good at the household we should just sell off E-bay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea sis.&quot; Bachiko said knowing how her sister's confidence needed help after her slow start.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to call my job and tell them I quit. Or maybe I should GO THERE and strut my stuff when I say it!&quot; Yukiko said wiggling her body enjoying anyone who looked at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need.&quot; Kupochu said, &quot;It's your destiny to serve master now. Everyone accepted that you're now his live in servant as soon the contract took effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still I'd like to do it, maybe I can charm some people into signing up!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think the gym is still our best bet. After Miya's show those girls are ready to join, they'll just need some encouragement!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you thank you thank!&quot; Miya did a mock bow. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, my boyfriend would be PURRRR-FECT for part of our family.&quot; Said Yukiko thinking (she was still perfectly intelligent, her mind was now focused on being visual appealing as being Master's work hand). &quot;A lawyer would be very useful. Though he might not sign the contract.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They don't have to take the contract seriously.&quot; 'Chu said, feeling proud to finally have something good to say. &quot;We just can't lie about it or pretend it isn't a contract. I thought the things in the contract about being a cat girl maid and loving it were a joke. And ta-da!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is gonna be great!&quot; Yukiko said clapping her hands together.<br />
<br />
Pimiko car needed gas, but with the funds from the others they were able to pay for it. Miya and Yukiko still insisted on jogging however. It also made good advertising for their recruitment drive.<br />
<br />
Pimiko's house wasn't much to look at it. It pretty much DEFINED average. One floor, a backyard the size of a closet, and it could use a new coat of paint. Pimiko didn't mind so much anymore. She had a new place to live, and a new purpose in life. <br />
<br />
&quot;I better go in first.&quot; Pimiko said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well duh it's your house.&quot; Miya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I mean for my son. He's expecting me home. And I'd like to be the one to bring him into the family. I don't want to scare him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot; Kupochu said remembering her own disappointment at her family not wanting to join her.<br />
<br />
Pimiko slowly came inside. 'It's okay. The contract makes it so this is who I was always meant to be. It's okay. He won't be frightened of me. It's okay. Everything is going to be okay.'  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? That you?&quot; She heard Davis call out form the living room where he was watching TV.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear it's me.&quot; 'I wonder. Is this why my age didn't change? Because of Davis?' She looked at herself in the entry way mirror.<br />
<br />
Pink eyes, pink paws, pink hair, and a magenta colored maid outfit that seemed to resist any attempt to make it dirty. Tall, firm and giving a mature look that her sisters all seemed to lack.<br />
<br />
She was perfect. She just hoped Davis accepted that. She had the contract already ready. <br />
<br />
Pimiko remembered Chu and Bachiko say how they used to be male before the contract, but now had two X chromosomes each. If her theory on her age was correct, did that mean that the contract wouldn't work on married men?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Davis.&quot; She said coming into the living room finding his vision glued to the TV. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I found a job.&quot;<br />
<br />
He got off the TV and hugged her on sheer reaction alone. &quot;That's great mom! That's so cool! I know you could do it! And . . . you look kinda different, did you get a hair cut?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pimiko hugged him back. &quot;Oh, just a little something that has to do with my new job. I got a job as a professional maintenance engineer and curator for a big inheritor. AND it's a lifetime contract and has instant tenure!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That means it's illegal to fire me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AH! I gotcha!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to have to move on site though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay! It's a big house! Really big! And room and board is provided!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But . . . what about dad? What if he comes back from Europe and we're not here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh . . . don't worry I'll leave a forwarding address.&quot;  She said, remembering what she had told him after her husband was murdered for the money in his wallet in a back alley by a druggie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are, are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I'm sure. Now dear, in order for this to work though, I really need YOUR help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Davis' eyes dawned a bit open from underneath his baseball hat. &quot;My help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear. Your help. You need to agree to live with me at the house. Well, technically you don't, but I've already promised to, it was part of the contract. And I don't want us to live apart . . . can you just promise . . . promise your mother that you'll stay with her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Davis looked at her, scared, unsure, worried, but nodded, &quot;Yes mom, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. The owner of the place we're staying wants to see it in writing. Can you just write your name right here dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pimiko handed her son the contract. He barely glanced it, and without hesitation signed his name.<br />
<br />
Davis immediately felt funny. &quot;Mom?&quot; He noticed his mom was all . . . pink, and was dressed up like a maid. And . . . she had cat ears and a tail?<br />
<br />
She hugged him again. &quot;Don't worry dear, it'll be over very quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Davis didn't age or loss a day. But he felt . . . VERY WEIRD. That was the best his nine year old mind could comprehend the situation as it stood as he felt his insides rearranging and something ODD happening below the waste.<br />
<br />
He didn't gain a great waterfall of hair like Miya (how Miya managed to do those stunts without getting caught up in her valley of hair was a mystery known only to her!). But his hair did grow about an inch or show. Like parent like child. But instead of turning all pink, Davis turned all purple! His skin paled. But his fingernails, hair, eyes, and lips all turned bright purple! His features softened as much as a child's could and he gained bits of muscle to make up for always having sat and watched TV rather than go outside and play. <br />
<br />
&quot;M-mommy . . . I think I'm sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you aren't dear. I promise. Just hold on a bit more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on, fer . . .what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Davis then, gain purple FUR if a lighter shade than that on her head. Her eyes became cat like, as did her face. The triangle cat ears emerged and the human ears vanished. A long tail pushed it way a bit uncomfortably from his rear and short. His shoes vanished and his feet morphed into bare paws which soon had sandals. <br />
<br />
Davis wandered to the coach and sat down her head swimming. Her power rangers hat simple vanished sadly. Then her shorts and turtle neck blended together, shifting into a pink and white maid uniform with a few extra ruffles it seemed. Gloves formed around her hands and form arms with holes for her claws. <br />
<br />
'I outta . . . I outta . . . I outta help mama-Pimiko, and everyone, to help Master, Family, and Household.' Davis thought dully, 'Huh? Why I think that? THat makes .  . that makes perfect sense. It does? It does. No it doesn't! yes it does!' Davis held her head, she had a headache.<br />
<br />
And that was when her mother sat down next to her kissed her on the forehead. <br />
<br />
And everything became as clear as crystal. She had a really really really important job to do! 'I gotta help make sure Mr. Master's house looks really nice and running even if I don't like! But I do like! But I hate chores! Wait, no I don't! I really love them! I want to do'em! More fun than watching TV!' <br />
<br />
&quot;Pimiko! We really outta go now! Mr. Master's waiting!&quot; She looked eagerly at the bigger cat girl maid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet dear. We have to find 'lots' of sisters for our family first before the week's over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Davis jumped up and saluted smiling. &quot;Aye-aye!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pimiko looked at it thoughtfully, &quot;Hm? Dear, from now on your name is Ai.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aye-aye! My name is Ai!&quot; Said the new cat girl maid triumphantly. <br />
