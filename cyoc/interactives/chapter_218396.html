<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I don’t think I can stop.” Sam relies softly. Sam pushes Cole back on the bed, slowly lowering herself more as Cole’s growing canine cock stretches deeper into her. Cole’s knot was now pushing up against Sam’s lips, waiting for the last push to lock them together. <br />
<br />
“But I don’t want them to see me like this. I am not trans like you. I just….” Cole studders with his words as Sam smiles softly at him. The smile was so cute and genuine that Cole couldn’t help but smile back. <br />
<br />
“Trust me.” Sam whispers as she starts to pull off the clothing from Cole. <br />
<br />
Dripping from the heat between them, Sam continues to slowly bob up and down on Cole’s member as she removes the clothes that they both took from Melissa’s room. Tossing them to the far side of the bed, out of site of the door, the hope was that if they did get caught, It would just look like a boy and a girl having sex and not anything else. <br />
<br />
Now with both completely nude, there was nothing hiding the changes that were happening to the both of them. She could see the now fully canine cock that was entering her. Sam’s C turning D cups breasts bounced slightly as she leans forward to give Cole a kiss. As they kiss, tongues tasting each other, Sam rubs her now dainty hands up and down Cole’s chest. He still had boobs, but they seemed to stop growing as he entered her. Sam could feel the muscles underneath flex with each breath. This turned her on as much as the canine cock rubbing her enter wall, Cole’s tip pressing up to her newly grown womb. <br />
<br />
For Cole, the fear of being caught left his mind. All that remand was this red head girl that was slowly meaning the world to him. With his arms around her, he squeezes tighter, bringing their bodies as close as possible. A new feeling of protection and authority filled him. Sam was his mate, in more ways than one now. <br />
<br />
As Sam’s hips came down in rhythm, Cole pushed up with his to seal the knot. Sam gasps as she fells the cock grow and stretch one more time inside her. The gasp breaks the kissing, but Sam once again smiles down at Cole as a new feeling comes over her for the first time. Sam shivers as she comes for the first time as a girl. Feeling the tightening around his cock, Cole too comes, sending seed into Sam’s waiting womb. The two hold each other as their bodies shutter and spasm. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Sam and Cole both decide to get up from their position. As Sam slides up, they find that Cole’s cock had return to its human form, yet slightly bigger. With that said, Cole’s chest had flattened back out with all signs of his feminine side gone for the time being. On reverse, Sam’s body had no masculine features. Her now full D breasts bounced with her movement. Her hips were flaring out, with her strong but then legs giving her a more hourglass look. The only hair on her body was the same boy cut on her head and the little patch of red just between her legs. <br />
<br />
Dripping from their sex, Sam stands up and instinctively moves her arm to hold up her breast as she rubs the opposite arm. “So, how was I?” <br />
<br />
Cole stands up too, taking Sam into his arms. “That was amazing.” Cole replies. In his mind, he was not lying. His sex with Erika was more bestial, more forced. He new that was just the salve or whatever else that had changed him. So was the head that was given earlier in the day. This sex had more meaning to him, and he could feel that hit meant a lot to Sam. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes of holding each other, they realized no one had come up to check on them. They used the opportunity to clean themselves off and get back dressed. Cole got into his normal clothes as Sam used the clothes they took from Melissa’s room. The problem was none of the tops fit anymore. The first one was ripped to pieces from Sam’s growing breasts, and the other was meant for a less developed girl. They decided to try to hide Sam’s breasts under his old shirt, coming up with the lie that her original shirt and bra ripped on the way home and Cole offered to give her one so she wouldn’t have to walk home exposed. <br />
<br />
The two then waited for a while, wondering what was taking Cole’s sister and mother so long to check on them. They both decide to walk out of the room, to face them head on. But as they do, they hear the two talking. <br />
<br />
“So, you don’t know how this happened, you just became pregnant from some random dog?” Cole could hear his mother say. Her voice had more concern than anything else in it. <br />
<br />
Then, through tears, Melissa replies. “I really don’t know. I just grew over the past few days and then these two came out. When I thought they were just dogs, I was going to just let them go, but now…” <br />
<br />
Cole and Sam wondered what was going on, so they peaked their heads around down the stairs. In the living room, Cole’s mom was standing, still holding her purse and keys. On the couch, Melissa sat, breasts exposed and breast feeding two small creatures. One looked like a baby with a dog tail, the other looked more like a canine. The thing that caught Cole’s and Sam’s eyes though was Melissa had more than just two breasts. She had two additional rows of breast under the first, each row just slightly smaller than the row above. <br />
<br />
“Oh, god.” Sam whispered. “Is that what’s going to us?” <br />
<br />
“I don’t know.” Cole whispers back.</p>
