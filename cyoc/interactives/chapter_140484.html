<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The violence isn&#39;t necessarily gratuitous... but given that there is some description of fake blood spurts as a result of the &quot;battle,&quot; I felt it best to include the warning... just to be safe.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Halloween really wasn&#39;t about fighting, but one of the things that Animalia had created was something that would play to some of the classic elements of Halloween that related to the spooky side of things. Things like werewolves and vampires seemed to fit in very well with that sort of thing. It&#39;s what made movies that involved either classic monster a favorite for Halloween, and the fact that Animalia presented a community of anthropomorphic animals gave that theme the opportunity to have things relate the common comparisons between werewolves and vampires, particularly as some of the more recent interpretations of vampires began to paint them in a more bat-like imagery than the classic human look that they had in earlier series.<br />
<br />
And that was what lead to the present &quot;fight&quot; at the Claw Coliseum, and was UFC&#39;s way to celebrate Halloween. The ring was set more to provide an open engagement with a large scale mat to provide padding and would set up the ultimate battle of werewolf versus vampire, with Carla Wolfe playing the role of werewolf and Miss Vivian as the vampire. And it did make some sense... as Carla, a Gray Wolf Animalian, and Vivian, a Vampire Bat Animalian, would fit those roles precisely. Of course the battle wouldn&#39;t be an actual fight, not in the way that the summer UFC-A tournament had been, and would actually be more of a staged show, which also made sense. A real fight between a Gray Wolf and a Vampire Bat in nature would either be a one sided killing of the bat, or the bat would go to a roost that the wolf couldn&#39;t follow.<br />
<br />
The fact that the battle for Boo Haw Haw was also supposed to depict a battle between a werewolf and a vampire carried within it other issues that were beyond what any Animalian or Human could attain. In pure theory, werewolves were supposed to be stronger and capable of dealing with more punishment, which could be well representative of how most Animalians were built with regard to their musculature, but vampires were often attributed with various powers that could range across a wide variety of abilities that Ms. Vivian couldn&#39;t realistically duplicate. A lot of that was why the fight had been scripted with a pre-determined winner, which Brett Horne knew as he made his way out to the center of the mat. He wasn&#39;t a great fan of that sort of thing, and figured it was something that made Pro Wrestling ridiculous, but since the match was more to provide something for Halloween, it might do well for a stunt that could set up some of the bigger and actual contests to come in the next year.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening ladies and gentle-ghouls, and Happy Halloween!&quot; Brett bellowed out and drawing a wave of cheers from the crowd that had gathered. It was smaller than what had been there for the UFC-A tournament in the summer, but they were well dressed in their costumes and there was some sense of excitement with all of them. It told Brett that the advertisements for fight had been fairly attractive in Animalia, &quot;tonight we may finally answer the greatest question in the Halloween mythos... on who would win... a Vampire, the creature of the night... or a Werewolf, the beast of the Full Moon!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a theatrical display, and Brett knew it, but it was Halloween and was never supposed to be an actual fight. Just something that would provide some spooky action for those that were more into the UFC-A than the idea for Spookyville&#39;s main theatrical act which had parodied some cartoon that he&#39;d never seen. The applause was enough for Brett to know that it worked. He then raised his free hand to point upward while the main lights dimmed and a spotlight turned on  to follow his hand toward the rafters above them. <br />
<br />
The spotlight then settled onto a roof beam where Ms. Vivian was perched for the moment, hanging from the beam the way bats would hang from trees or cave walls. For the event, Ms. Vivian wore heavy black leather one piece swimsuit, fishnet stockings leading to leather boots, though they didn&#39;t wrap around her feet in order allow Ms. Vivian to grip the roof beam with her toes. For the moment her head was concealed within her wings. The pose helped draw up tension and also hid the black collar that she wore as well. It gave off a sort of &quot;dominatrix&quot; vibe to it, but she figured it&#39;d also be something that would draw attention to the boutique as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Representing the deadly seducers... fluttering on a bat&#39;s wings, Ms. Vivian!&quot; Brett called out.<br />
<br />
With that, Ms. Vivian released her grip on the beam and then flew down, circling the main scoreboard before settling in for a landing next to Brett. There was a small cheer of applause as the lights grew dimmer and Brett turned to one of the entry ways to the mat at the center of the arena. He could note the glowing eyes in that point, which showed that Carla was there and would mean the show for Halloween would go on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Representing the servants of King Lycaon, Carla Wolfe!&quot; Brett announced as Carla came forward.<br />
<br />
Carla came forward in what looked like a white training gi with a black belt tied around her waist. It was securely fastened and didn&#39;t hold any of the slightly sexual tones that Ms. Vivian&#39;s costume did, and was chosen to essentially counter how Ms. Vivian was presented. Carla got some applause as she came out, giving a sort of spooky howl as she did so. Carla approached and shook hands with Ms. Vivian with Brett in between them, it was noted that neither combatant was wearing the assorted protective gear that the normal UFC-A fights required, which was a further sign that the battle was to be staged as a special Halloween event.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now this fight is to remain clean,&quot; Brett spoke, &quot;in that there is to be no hypnosis turning into mist or anything of that nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Ms. Vivian nodded, playing to the skit that was being put on.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are also to be no blows to the chest, head, neck, reproductive areas, or wings, understood?&quot; Brett spoke calmly as he looked between the two and going over the specialized rules for the &quot;battle&quot; that was to be fought, &quot;and no biting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both soon nodded as they prepared to go through with the skit and the battle. The winner had actually been determined by an online poll that was put up over the course of the month leading up to Halloween, and as the votes were tallied, the story for the battle was then put together. Over the last few days while Spookyville was put together for its final assembly, the small group put together the story for how the fight would go to show the fan vote. If it worked well for all sides, there would be the potential for there to be rematches or other assorted &quot;movie monster&quot; fights to help draw attention.<br />
<br />
Of course to sell the battle on Halloween, there had been some creativity that went into selling it as well, and this soon became apparent as the battle began. Under both Carla&#39;s gi and Ms. Vivian&#39;s &quot;swimsuit&quot; there were little packets of red food dye. It would be dark enough to mimic blood and was held in plastic packets and taped onto the insides of their clothing. In the course of the fight, either Carla or Ms. Vivian would take a swipe at the other, and would aim specifically at where these packets were. This would in turn lead to tears and rips in the clothing that would allow enough of the red dye to squirt out and give the viewers their potential scare.<br />
<br />
Brett remained on the mat to provide a loose referee to make sure that the act didn&#39;t go wrong, and nothing did. Ms. Vivian would go with a series of swooping attacks that including flying up and then diving down toward to swipe at Carla. Carla would often dodge and then try to tackle Mrs. Vivian when the Vampire Bat Animalian made a landing as part of her attacks. More often than not, Ms. Vivian managed to dodge, using her wings to their full mobility advantage that Carla seemingly couldn&#39;t match, particularly in the open arena. There were a few gasps from the crowd when spurts of &quot;blood&quot; erupted from the areas that had been clawed. It ended with Carla staggering as she pretended to be woozy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blasted blood-sucker!&quot; Carla gave a curse, playing her role, &quot;you&#39;ve... stolen... evv… …&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Carla went silent as she dropped to a knee as Ms. Vivian came forward. Ms. Vivian gave a small smile as she looked to Carla and playing the role of some Vampiric noble finishing a battle with her werewolf enemy. A part of her figured that a real life fight between a Vampire and a Werewolf would really be more of a draw and the victor would be dependent on specific circumstances, but the poll had vampires ahead of werewolves in who the voters thought would win, and thus the fight was written out to play to that result.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t hate me because I&#39;m beautiful, dog,&quot; Ms. Vivian replied and gave a low push at Carla&#39;s shoulder, which sent Carla onto her back.<br />
<br />
There was a shocked gasp that went through the crowd as Brett and Ms. Vivian looked back at them. It was clear that they didn&#39;t expect the &quot;battle&quot; that had been put on, with its splattering of red food dye to mimic blood across the mat, as well as Carla&#39;s and Ms. Vivian&#39;s costumes. The audience sat there for a moment and said nothing until finally Carla sat up again and gave a loud call that caught all of the people there to pay attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! You didn&#39;t think it was REAL did you?!&quot; Carla gave a laugh.<br />
<br />
That earned a few laughs and then cheers as Carla got up, gave a short bow to Ms. Vivian and then lifted up Ms. Vivian&#39;s free hand. That earned more cheers as those that had come to watch the &quot;fight&quot; fully recognized that the battle was more an act for Halloween than an actual bout.</p>
