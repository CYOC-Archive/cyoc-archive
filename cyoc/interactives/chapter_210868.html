<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan thought indeed that nothing had occurred and forgot all about his crazy sister&#39;s stories. But Kat decided to be more patient. She was aware that spells could take time to complete themselves. Finding the form most suitable for her idiotic brother could demand a bit of time for the magic to figure out what to do, across the myriad of possibilities and the meandering of what would be most appropriate. So as a result, Dan felt the effect of the magic only after three hours. He was eating a large box of snacks when he felt engulfed by a tidal wave of pure energy. The world swirled around him and everything became a blur. As if fainting, he tumbled down into darkness. However, he was not fainting. He was being propelled into another world to meet his proper punishment.<br />
<br />
 When Dan opened his eyes, he first felt a hot, humid air around him. As he got up, groaning, he realized immediately that he was not home. On the contrary, he was in the middle of a jungle. The sky was blue, the sun shining and birds chirped around him. Everything was green, lush and covered in flowers. It was beautiful and worthy of the best tropical locations. However, he was alone and lost. That took the enchanting aspects away. He called out for help and then remembered Kat&#39;s spell. Could it... Could it actually be true? Dan took a few steps. He was getting frightened. Sure, for now things were all right, but this thick, unknown jungle must contain predators, right? What if a deadly snake bit him? A movement nearby caught his attention and he turned around, frightened. He saw that it was a man, with a spear and a loincloth. They stared at each other and right when Dan was about to speak and ask for help, the man whistled with two fingers in his mouth. At once, other men, similarly dressed and armed, emerged from the bushes. They looked at Dan with scowls or at best guarded wariness. Then a couple of men talked with each other, in a language unknown to the teen. After a few tense minutes, one man signalled Dan to follow him and the young man obeyed. He was thus surrounded by these men and thusly escorted back to their village. He attempted to speak but no one understood his words. Moreover, their looks did not prompt him to insist. So they made their way back in silence, while Dan wondered worryingly what they planned for him. Did they want to eat him? Kill him as a sacrifice? Torture him? None of anything he thought about reassured him. <br />
<br />
When they arrived at the little village, made of huts and stone houses, everyone left their fires and current activity to go and surround the arrivals. Mainly to stare at Dan, actually. There were women and children, as well as elderly people. Dan attempted another time to communicate but it reached no result. It was as if he had said nothing. Then, an elderly man and woman arrived, dressed in elaborate attires, and talked to the men that had captured Dan, then amongst themselves and then to the other villagers gathered round. Everyone clapped and cheered at the elderly couple&#39;s words. Immediately, women ran off in every direction. Dan, for one, was rather worried. What did it all mean? A feast? Was he a guest or dinner? Was he going to get sacrificed for good? The old important people were staring at him so intently that he felt undressed by them. The men held a few discussions until a child jumped up and down in excitement, waving and shouting. The men pushed Dan forward and he obeyed with a heavy heart. What sort of distraction was he to get involved in? What would he be expected to suffer for the entertainment of all? He was led to a large hut and made to enter it. Unlike his vision of knives and a bloody altars, with the gruesome remains of previous victims, what he saw delighted his eyes. It was a hut fit for a king. Nay, a sultan. Definitely a sultan. Because he was offered his own harem.<br />
<br />
The hut  was decorated with flowered and had a large bed. It was comfy with furs and feathers. An army of young women attended Dan and granted his every desire. Or rather, they served him without him complaining about it. They brought him food, fruits, roasts, honey and all kind of delicious delicacies on leaves and wooden plates. They served him coconut water and all sorts of meals. First, they had undressed him and bathed him, scrubbing suds with their hands all over him. Even to clean up his groin, testicles, penis and anus. Oh, of course he had felt himself harden but the girls had just smiled at that. They had tied a leather loincloth around his waist. Dan had worn only that but he could not care less. The women around him were young, nubile and walking around with very little, most often bare-chested or in the nude. They refused, all of them, to have sex with him but ministered to his privates lovingly. They kissed him, massaged him, fed him with their own hands and stuffed him with food. Dan was caressed by them and he only had to snap his fingers at something for it to be brought to him. He was not allowed out of the hut but it was not a concern at all. He had everything he could wish for right here! He was caressed, fondled and massaged all day long! Even when he had to pee he could gesture for a girl to hold his penis while he relieved himself in a bowl. And if he got an erection, a girl, or several, would stroke or kiss his virile member until he cummed. It was great! A dream come true! These savage men must have been impressed by his muscles, his beauty and his natural charisma, Dan thought with all the cockiness he was capable of. They had thought him a god and rewarded him by offering him their beautiful women. Well, already girls at his school were all over him, so it was only natural it&#39;d continue here. He was treated like a god and it was his due. Kat&#39;s spell had backfired spectacularly. Of course. That moron was incapable of doing anything right. <br />
&quot;Thanks for the spell, Kat!&quot; he screamed sometimes, while in bed surrounded by the members of his harem.<br />
His sultan-of-the-jungle lifestyle did have slight disadvantages, though. He was having more than three meals a day, that was certain. He was stuffed with fruits, meat, porridge, milk and countless other foods that although delicious, did affect his body. That and not moving around much, as he was attended every second of the day. He was developing quite a belly. Yet strangely, it did not appear to repulse the women serving him. On the contrary, they were delighted by it and offered him more and more food, eagerly pressing the meals into his mouth. Dan knew he should not eat so much but it felt so good... And his new harem adored him when he ate and were ecstatic at the sight of the tummy protruding above his loincloth, so why should he stop himself? These savages must belong top a culture where he rich are fat and considered handsome and powerful. He could work with that. The girls around him were curvy and skinny but if they were elated at the idea of living with a chubby guy, who was he to argue against it? And on it went for weeks and weeks. <br />
<br />
Then, one day, as he woke up, Dan was startled to not be greeted by his harem serving him bread with honey and roasts. Instead he saw the elderly important-looking woman next to him. She barked something and his harem did arrive, but with different foods than usual. Fruit purees, porridge and jars of milk. He was stuffed with food, all day long, with it forced down his throat if he resisted. The elderly women kept watching as the girls made him eat evermore banana, peach, mango and guava purees, all to wash it down with milk. Porridge was also spoonfed to him in spite of his protests. Then, at long last, the girls stopped and the elderly woman approached, a bowl in her hand. Dan was nervous but he could hardly move. He felt weak, bloated and sleepy. He clearly had a tummy now, more prominent than ever before. The elderly woman then started chanting and dipped her fingers in the bowl in her hand. It was a thick gooey red substance and she traced intricate symbols upon Dan&#39;s skin after a young girl had removed his loincloth. The paint dried quickly and as she chanted, she left no space of Dan&#39;s body unattended. After attending his torso and paunchy belly, she turned him over and proceeded to cover in painted symbols his backside. His buttocks got painted, same as his privates diligently covered. And as she chanted, Dan felt weaker and weaker. In the end, by the time the priestess left, he could not escape the drowsiness overcoming him and carrying him off to sleep, forgetting the prickly feeling he was sensing from the areas covered by the paint he was smeared with.  <br />
<br />
When Dan woke up, the afternoon was nearing its end. He knew it from the position of the sun in the sky and the light. He was outside. And he was... being jostled. Yes, jostled. He saw the trees of the jungle pass by and grunts beneath him. He turned a little his head, with much effort and he understood what was happening. He was being carried by six men on a wooden sort of stretcher across the jungle. Dan tried to ask what was happening but he felt incredibly feeble. His limbs barely responded to the rest of his body and jerked or flailed about helplessly. He felt just... bloated. Simply bloated to the last degree. From his very limited vision he could see his belly, pudgier and paunchier than ever. Worthy of an obese person. And to think he had mocked mercilessly with his friends any guy with a beer-belly... He tried to speak again but his world were just incomprehensible babble. He was too tired and weak to speak, even... What was happening? Everything had gone awesomely well until this morning and... And then Dan understood. The harem and dream life had been a sham. A temporary bliss. He was being sacrificed in the end, just spoiled until the time came to slaughter him. Treated like a god until the time came to die in the name of one. It appeared Kat&#39;s spell had functioned after all... Dan, distraught, decided to slip back into his slumber. Hopefully, he&#39;d be sleeping by the time he was killed and wouldn&#39;t know what was befalling him.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Dan, this did not happen. Or rather, fortunately things got different from that he had imagined. He woke up to the sound of drums. JJHe was still very restricted in his movements, but he saw they were near a more mountainous region, with more grey rocks and cliffs. He was in a sort of giant coconut shell, from which he could not extricate himself. He could just flail about miserably, shouting babbles and gurgles, while he rocked helplessly in the shell like a turtle on its back. Seven men were watching him warily from afar, one steadily beating the drums. Dan called out to them but they barely paid attention to him. Their looks were focused towards something beyond the teen. Dan did notice that the paint was gone and that his loincloth had been replaced by a leather one closer to the skin and groin, and filled with a very soft padding inside, something like feathers or moss or both. The feeling was comfy but Dan still felt bloated and he saw how chubby his arms were, how pudgy his fingers were and how round his belly was. He was a fatso! The type he loved to make fun of with his pals! He had been fed like a piglet and looked after, only to finish killed by some sort of god loved by ignorant savages. He was about to shout out and cry his despair but he was halted by the noise of something approaching. Something big. The drummer heard it too and stopped. All waited with bated breath. Dan most of all. He couldn’t see! What was happening? And then the tread came closer and closer and he saw it bend over him.<br />
<br />
It was an ape! A giant ape! An ape that looked at him with much curiosity and then smiled. With a huge finger it prodded and poked Dan who feebly made his refusal known.<br />
&quot;Hey! Hey! Stop!&quot;<br />
It only came out as babble and the ape proceeded with his inspection. Or rather, her inspection, as Dan saw that it had visible boobs. It was also wearing flowers behind her ears. It cooed at the boy and started poking at his belly. Dan twitched and squirmed but moving out of the way was just impossible. The ape tapped his belly, amused by it, apparently and continued poking it. At one point, she poked a bit much and wriggled her finger. Dan let out an enormous giggle. He was surprised by it. He had never been ticklish before. And why was his laugh so infantile and high-pitched? The ape, for one, was utterly enchanted by this noise and proceeded to hear more of it. She clapped and cooed in utter delight. Soon, from his cradle, Dan was chucked under the chin and tickled mercilessly. The ape was adamant in discovering where he was sensitive to tickles. She gave him light brushes of her nails, wriggled her fingers, made them glide on Dan&#39;s new sensitive skin and peppered her new baby with kisses with her muzzle. All of his body could produce these sounds, she was elated to discover, with the right ministrations, but it was his flat feet, armpits and adorable belly that were the most ticklish. The female ape cooed at her new baby joyfully. He was so adorable! Especially this paunchy belly! He squirmed and wriggled in the most enchanting way when she peppered him with kisses and rubbed her muzzle at him! She couldn&#39;t wait to see him crawling on the ground or toddling and waddling in his diaper in a few decades&#39; time! A beautiful chubby little boy! A most adorable one at that! With such an amusing sound when he was tickled! Yes, that darling new baby of hers was perfect! Simply perfect! She&#39;d make sure his belly would stay the same for a long, long time by stuffing him with delicious purees and milk. She&#39;d cradle him to sleep and pamper him as much as she could. Which meant mollycoddling him without pause, in her mind. Such a silly little thing! He would be completely dependent on her and she would make sure to raise him with care and love, attending his every need, from giving him milk and purees to making sure his diaper was clean and comfy. As for Dan, he was being subjected to a babying treatment he was powerless to stop. In the eyes pf the ape, he saw what had been dome to him. He was now a giant, hairless, chubby baby. He had been stuffed and looked after to prepare him for his new life as the surrogate baby of a female King Kong! That new loincloth was in fact a diaper! The priestess had just spread some sort of magic paint to transform him! He was too weak to escape her maternal clutches. He could only gurgle and speak baby talk as her was bounced on his new mommy&#39;s knees and then rocked to sleep in her arms. Much to his chagrin, after being left an exhausted, twitching and sobbing mess thanks to his new mother&#39;s great fun in tickling him, his eyes drooped and he fell asleep, not noticing his new mother taking him far into her species&#39; territory within the jungle. The men breathed in relief. The giant ape was happy with their sacrifice. It was not always the case and it was extremely lucky to have found this stranger in the forest. He looked cute but stupid enough to entice the female ape coming to claim the due offered to their species. The giant apes were happy and would leave the giant fruit or prey living in. their lands for the villagers to take at times or let them enter their lands to gather its giant produce without harm. The village was safe and had not needed to sacrifice one of their own or to capture the member of another tribe and start diplomatic problems. The fate of the sacrificed was not one any envied: to be pampered and be a baby for decades and slowly grow up to be a giant ape as time went on... Sure, the lifespan of these creatures was counted in millennia but as the sacrificed reached puberty, it became an ape and no more a giant human baby. Tradition and long observation had taught this tribe that these apes loved the giant human babies offered to replenish their kind because they were cute with their different features and soft, hairless and ticklish skin, but that as a result they were pampered and fussed over always, whether male or female. As a result, the males got to be soft and timid and were taken as mates by the giant male apes, those born from ape parents. Hence some same-sex male ape couples forming and adopting another human sacrifice. Often, seeing how their mollycoddled sons turned out to be, sweet and shy and easily frightened, more at home in more feminine roles, the mother apes that had adopted sacrificed humans would mate them with strong young males that would protect them. The tribes of giant apes never saw this as a problem. A loving mate was a loving mate, just as different sort of couples could form. The sacrifices from the humans could solve any problems in getting offsprings, for a small price. Of course, for the sacrificed, life was not great at all, notably at the start. Like the others, Dan would feel awful, being a baby among apes. The lack of other humans would erase the size differences but it would be hard for him to accept being pampered and fussed over, to live like a baby and to grow up again as a little ape that needed attention and loving care. He&#39;d be easily tickled into submission and cooed at while he was being treated like a fussy baby if he tried to resist the daily ministrations he&#39;d be subject to. If his new mommy didn&#39;t tickle him, all other females would be delighted to do it and males happy to spank him if he was being too naughty. As the years rolled by, he senses dulled by the over-stuffing of food and life as a pampered little ape, slowly the spell of the priestess and the inescapability of his new life would make him really think he was an ape. As he transformed into one at puberty, he would have forgotten having been a human altogether and start his new adult life as a giant ape, probably attracting the stares of many potential mates, both male and female. For in the end, Kat&#39;s spell had worked perfectly well. Dan had thought himself a true emperor at home, using his male chromosome and handsomeness to get whatever he wanted and get away with anything. He thought and assumed he&#39;d get a similar treatment in the jungle. However, it was only to set him on his ultimate fate: a little emperor, yes, but in the eyes of a new mommy bent on mollycoddling him as a baby and not an arrogant teenager, all to grow up to be more than probably a very feminine mate to another male ape, rougher, bigger, more muscular, but nicer and ind incredibly more attentive and loving than Dan had ever been as a proud, much too arrogant and bullying human male.</p>
