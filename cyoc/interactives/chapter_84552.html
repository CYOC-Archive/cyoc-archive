<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elise paced back and forth, Flake giggled at the site. &quot;Relax, Elise, they&#39;ll get it, hun. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded. &quot;Flake, can I ask you something.&quot; She looked.<br />
<br />
Flake nodded. &quot;Certainly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How well did you take it when you first changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Acceptionally well, dear. I mean at first, I freaked out, but after wards the change was beautiful.&quot; Flake smiled. &quot;Plus it potentially led to my mother in-law to becoming Queen of France.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, queen? You mean Alexis is a princess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Officially, yes. We even went as far as deciding that when the time comes, we shall take over. The people of France, are surprisingly happy. And it would seem many nations there have decided to follow suit and return to using kings and queens. NATO even is accepting it, due to the change in the dominant species in Europe. About... fifty-three percent, now don&#39;t quote me on it, are kats, in Europe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; Elise paced back and forth as Snowy walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elise, you ready dear? We got the set up done. However it is recomended that you be in a room solo. After all, what we read about Raptors, well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand, Snowy.&quot; She said. &quot;But how long will I be... um... you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do not know. Once you do we&#39;ll let you out however. We&#39;ll keep contact and food. It&#39;s a precaution, okay?&quot; Snowy assured her.<br />
<br />
Snowy led Elise in and Flake looked in at her through a glass high up. Snowy then took and administered the serum and left. Flake called down. &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know yet, Flake.&quot; She said, sitting down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may wanna strip down, Elise.&quot; Flake suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; She did so as she looked around and then began pacing.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
An hour later she was still pacing but nothing. It wasn&#39;t until twenty-four hours later something began to happen. Elise was wracked in pain. Flake looked down all worried. &quot;Elise?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elise let out a loud roar as she started her change, first scales started at her head, as she grew taller. Elise was screaming in pain as she changed, but Flake wouldn&#39;t leave. Alexis walked up to her mate and looked in. &quot;It&#39;s started?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I&#39;m worried. She&#39;s in too much...&quot; Her words were intereupted by another yell. Her arms became coated in scales in a matter of seconds, her hands retained their five fingers, but became clawed at the end. Her breasts became bigger, as slits on her breasts were formed to hide her nipples. What happened next when she hit a certain height, was legs grew out. Her originals were changing as her new ones came in. all four had the traditional raptor claw. once her body was the proper length the tail started to grow. Once finished, the unfortunate part to be final was the head. Her hair fell out and muzzle pushed forward  Her teeth had fallen out onto the ground. Once finished her coloration started to come in. When she was done she was now a Raptor cat, based on the deinonychus, one of the many members in the raptor family. Her for legs were not like that of the traditional kat where the forefeet doubled as a hand, but more like a raptor. But when she looked down, her lust skyrocketed, but this wasn&#39;t what was worrysome to Flake, it was what a raptor is capable of. She looked up as a cock grew from her slit, and just behind that her pussy was puffy. She then looked at Flake and Alexis. But that&#39;s when a different kind of lust hit. Not the kind of lust to fuck, but the lust to want to eat. Snowy having forseen this had prepared it, dropping several kinds of meet through the roof.<br />
<br />
Elise then started to devour the meet in seconds. &quot;The side effect is not lust. Yes shi&#39;s horny, but hir appitite just skyrocketed. Shi&#39;ll not be in hir right mind, which is actually on purpose, which we explained to hir. Shi volunteered to test the new vaccine, which once shi eats we&#39;ll give to hir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flake nodded. &quot;Makes since.&quot;<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
During that time Maurice was at work, concocting the Vaccine, extracted from Charlie&#39;s venum. What baffled hir is that when introduced to a new strand of the virus, the vaccine seemed to grow stronger and beat it. Maurice went into to taking the vaccine appart bit by bit. Shi was wondering what made this vaccine stronger and stronger. However shi had Raul bring in the scientist to ask him, having him sit down. &quot;Look, if you help me, I can help you. Tell me what you did.&quot; Maurice asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it you want to know and how can you help me?&quot; The scientist looked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help because I&#39;ve got friends in high places. Do you know what they did to Sang?&quot; Shi asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leathal injection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That but much worse. You see, there were some kats who were naturally lust filled before they became kats, so we sent him into the pit to be raped by what he was trying to have, right up until he begged for the death.&quot; Maurice said. &quot;I can make it where you get a minimum of ten years and you&#39;ll be a free man with parole, or even better. You can work here as my assistant, and reside in Janice jail, for no less than twenty. Once I say otherwise you will reside here for another twenty as my assistant. With no contact from the outside. After your total forty you will be a free man to do what  you want. Should you commit a crime like that in the Vatican again, however, you will be shot right on the spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
The scientist looked. &quot;I&#39;ll take the twenty and stay.&quot; He stood up and walked over. Maurice smiling at that. &quot;What I did was combined the virus and the vaccine into one. I know it&#39;s not as simple as it sounds, and believe me it&#39;s not. It&#39;s not the core of the virus and vaccines I combined. It&#39;s a little bit smaller. You see the virus is made up of cells and the vaccine is also made up of cells. I took half of the two and merged them. And tossed in various insect DNA. And truth be told, I was only aiming for a area like you and Miss Snow. I didn&#39;t enjoy that they killed what I created. But you see, I never intended them to be violent. I worked for Sang so I can see my dream. Not his. He wanted destruction, but I wanted beauty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice smiled and as shi listed to the beats of his heart shi believed him. This man was after the same goal shi and Snowy were. Not what Sang, but he choose a different route. &quot;Well, then, I can&#39;t say I judge you for what you did then. However I was studying what you went wrong as for your scorpkats. If, you wish to create new ones, ask for volunteers. I and Snowy can&#39;t take credit for that, but the inspiration behind it we can.&quot; shi smiled. &quot;So how close where you with the other leutinents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very. I know where they are all at and precisely what they&#39;re planning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you can help with their capture, your sentence will be canceled as for going to jail, however you will have to stay as my assistant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In that case, they are on Pyongyong. Sang worked for the North Korean and South Korean government. The two were still one but having South Korea open was just a mask behind the true plans. WIth the populational boom, they plan to spread and then invade Japan first, and go towards all the island nations, followed by Vietnam, and all those in the southern side of China. After that, they go right in....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And take China, followed by India and any small nations in between, Russia, the middle east, then Europe followed by Africa, head strait across to Austrailia then close in on South America on both sides then close in on us.&quot; Raul walked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct, sir. But the precise location in Pyongyong is not easy, you&#39;re talking about a massive city.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, fortunately I&#39;ve got a friend in Pyongyong.&quot; Maurice said. &quot;He would tell me anything that happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice continued to work, with the help of the scientist, who shi found was willing to help correct what he messed up on. Turned out though he wasn&#39;t one of the Leutinents but one bellow. Sation was his name. Raul then realized it wasn&#39;t one of them he arrested in Paris, but infact was his twin. Which made since. A lot of mix ups have happened. The scientist was true to his word and helped perfect the vaccine.<br />
<br />
&quot;So now let&#39;s see how it reacts to...&quot; Maurice put the strongest strand of the virus to date in and the new vaccine killed it, as if the vaccine were godzilla and the virus were a tiny flea. Maurice smiled. &quot;I think we&#39;ve done it.&quot; Maurice smiled shaking the scientists hand. &quot;Raul, go ahead and house him in with me and my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he&#39;s a te....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Raul, I made a deal with the man. I&#39;ll handle the consolate. He&#39;s made up for his crime in the Vatican.&quot; Maurice smiled as shi headed into where Elise was waiting.<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
After Elise had eaten and fell asleep, Snowy had dropped a note with a blindfold down. Elise read it and put the fold on after she had woke. Flake looked down. &quot;Elise, can you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I can. But I know what&#39;ll happen should I remove this.&quot; Shi said. &quot;Umm,&quot; Shi rubbed hir head.<br />
<br />
Maurice had walked in and right up behind hir. Elise jumped as if bit right in the ass as Maurice administered the new vaccine. Elise smiled turning to Maurice, removing the fold, shi hugged hir and began to purr. In a few hours they left and Elise hugged Flake, who both purred, Alexis smiled liking how Elise looked, and walked up. &quot;You know, I see how you two are towards each other. I was thinking, would there be anything wrong with we becoming a Trimates?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trimates?&quot; Flake and Elise asked together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you see, instead of mates as in two, trimates is three.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flake and Elise&#39;s smiles only grew as the three girls walked up and Elise hugged Snowy then Maurice as if to say thanks, they headed to Flake&#39;s home.<br />
<br />
Of course Alexis was kidding and the two knew that. So they decided that they&#39;d search for the next to become a raptorkat for her.<br />
<br />
As they got ready to go on, Ryles came running up. &quot;Where&#39;s Jess...&quot; Shi looked nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... last we knew they were...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well our eggs are hatching, mine and Casey&#39;s. They are hatching.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A day after Sammy and Gloria&#39;s? Well I&#39;ll be.&quot; Flake smiled.<br />
Alexis looked at Ryles. &quot;I&#39;ll go get her.&quot; She took off as Flake looked. &quot;How many?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we discovered only three were fertile, the rest were duds. Much similar with some reptiles. They&#39;ll lay duds incase of theives who wish to devour eggs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... well, let&#39;s go.&quot; Flake said.</p>
