<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Timothy raced home. He headed upstairs to his brothers room. His brother, John, was sitting on his bed listening to music, and read a sports magazine.<br />
<br />
"hey bro!"<br />
<br />
"What's up Tim?"<br />
<br />
Tim recounted his encounter at the store. He held out the other three chocolates. His brother just laughed.<br />
<br />
"As if! You make up the craziest stories I've ever heard."<br />
<br />
"But it's true! With this, I can get things, like that dog I've always wanted."<br />
<br />
"Not while i'm here. You know I have allergies. Now go tell your loony tales to someone else."<br />
<br />
<br />
Timothy left the room mumbling.<br />
<br />
"I wish I had loving, loyal dog instead of a brother..."<br />
<br />
John resumed his music and sports binge. As he read, The colors on the pages seemed to become muted.<br />
<br />
"Ow!"<br />
<br />
He held his ears before turning off the music player. The sounds from the speakers had started to hurt.<br />
<br />
Hearing his brother shout, Timothy went to investigate. He froze in the doorway. His brothers feet had begun to lengthen. <br />
they had stretched to twice their normal length. His ears had also changed. They had grown pointed, and moved to the top of his head! A fine layer of fur matching John's hair color, covered them.<br />
<br />
"John?!"<br />
<br />
The sound of his brother voice had brought him out of some trance.<br />
<br />
Hey Tim! what's up? Did you come to play fetch?"<br />
<br />
<br />
"Fetch? With who?"<br />
<br />
"With me silly. You know how much I love to play fetch." A tail ripped through his jeans and began wagging.<br />
<br />
<br />
Timothy was shocked. He didn't know what was happening. His brother starting to look and act like a dog.<br />
<br />
<br />
"Tim? Whaths wrrrong? Arrrr yooo feeling oOOOOkaaay?? Ow-ooOOO!"<br />
<br />
<br />
John's face popped as pushed out. His nose and mouth became a muzzle, as he began panting with his lengthening tongue hanging out. His canines grew long and sharp, while his nose darkened in color. Although it hurt, he was oblivious to the change.<br />
<br />
<br />
"ooowhy Arrrre yoooo rooking ah mee rike that?"<br />
<br />
<br />
John's speech continued to slur as his mouth and mind lost the ability to speak.<br />
<br />
In his mind, John was confused. He was looking at his younger brother, but he kept think 'master'. But that was normal right? After all, Tim was his master. Right? No. something was wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
"rrrrarrrooooruffruffOOOoo?"<br />
<br />
<br />
John whined and grimaced, his toes were growing dark claws as they shortened and rearranged. His big toes shrank and moved up his feet, becoming dew claws. Pads formed as his legs changed, shortening here, lengthening there, the sound of popping and cracking bones could be heard. His legs shrank a little as muscles were rebuilt, and fur covered them. His hands followed their example as they also sprouted dark claws and pads.<br />
<br />
<br />
John felt really odd. He couldn't understand why. He scratched his chest, and seemed to figure it out. His clothes! He didn't need them! He wasn't meant to... or was he?<br />
<br />
He tore his shirt off, and wagged his growing tail. He felt better, but things still felt off. Looking down, he grunts/barks as he plays with his pant button. His groin was tingling and moving, and he didn't like it.<br />
<br />
Popping the button off, he pealed of his pants and underwear.<br />
<br />
Timothy saw a cross between human and canine testes, no pointed tip, but a knot had formed.<br />
<br />
John's mind clicked as he realized what was going on.<br />
<br />
<br />
"I'm turning into a friggin' dog!"<br />
 He tried to call for help, but only barks, whines and growls came out. A pain shout through his head. In his mind John's identity was changing.<br />
<br />
His memories of high school, <br />
sports and friends were fading into the recesses of his mind. The part part of him  that had figured out what was wrong, was too distant to be heard. All human thought was sealed away by some unknown force, as his attention was drawn once again to his cock. A sheath grew around his erection, as John instinctively licked himself. Panting contently, John looked over at Timothy. His still human eyes conveyed his undying loyalty and love.<br />
<br />
<br />
John got off the bed and walked on all fours to Timothy. He gave him a loving doggy kiss as sat obediently at <br />
his feet, wagging his tail.<br />
<br />
<br />
Timothy tried to understand what was happening as John nudged him, begging for attention.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fur began covering John's body as it reformed, bones cracked and joints popped. His chest barreled out as his <br />
waist thinned out. His arms shortened, while his hands degraded. his thumbs dwindled in size as the moved up <br />
his arms. his other fingers popped and crunched as they became canine digits.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, the fur covered his face, as the last of his human features were erased.<br />
<br />
Timothy recalled his idle wish, realizing what he had done as he looked back at his brother.<br />
<br />
his mom's voice interrupted his thinking.<br />
<br />
"Timothy? Will you be a dear and take John out for a walk?"<br />
<br />
a slight smile appeared on his face. His brother was now his pet dog.<br />
<br />
"John? are you in there?"<br />
<br />
John stared back, not able comprehend the words. He wagged his tail, his master was talking to him. That was enough.<br />
<br />
Timothy went to search a leash, as John kept watch. It was in his training. His master would call him if he was needed. Grabbing a leash from the hall closet, he came back to find the room transformed. The room now had a dog bed on the floor, and dog care products in the bathroom. All of Timothy's things were now moved in. It was as if Johnathan Adams had never been. Awards for best in show were hanging on the wall.<br />
<br />
A paper on the dresser caught his eye. Reading over it, he saw it was a contract for stud services. He was making allot of money from this deal too.<br />
<br />
Looking at John, he pulled out a chocolate. <br />
<br />
He smiled mischievously.</p>
