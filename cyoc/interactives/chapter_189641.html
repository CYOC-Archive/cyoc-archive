<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Atlantis, whenever someone on the surface said the name of the “mythical” lost city which sank below the waves images of either a super advance city hidden deep in the ocean or the remains of a once great city with Greek colonnades and the like come to mind. None of that was the truth.<br />
The truth was that Atlantis wasn’t all that impressive, the central area did have the ancient style of buildings, with a cross of what looked to be Greek/roman columns mixed in with some Egyptian like pyramids but the rest of the city looked like something out of the 1920s or even earlier. Square stone buildings going a dozen floors high with some much higher buildings which would be called skyscrapers if it wasn’t for the fact that they where all underwater. There where neon signs and lights seamed off, they would later learn that all power came from a type of coral which conducted electricity even underwater but gave off a neon type of light in a glass tube. <br />
For the formally humans they saw all this from what was basically a monorail which was carrying them toward the main hospital. The monorail seamed to sever like a bus system with multiple stations however they were in a closed car meaning they didn’t stop at any of the stations. There where streets below them, cobblestone streets which had something kin to a truck and even animal drawn vehicles pulled by really large crabs. The merpeople they swam up and down the buildings entering doors built along the sides along with the windows and seamed to be going about their day. They came in all different shapes and sizes, almost all of them where fit however thanks to all the swimming but there just didn’t seam to be a whole lot of them. <br />
A lot of the streets where empty and more then a few buildings were blocked off with their windows dark, abounded because of lack of people. Some of the more distant buildings seamed to be in disrepair from lack of use and there was visible trash on the street. It was a far cry from the image of a super advance hidden civilization that the surface used whenever they showed Atlantis. <br />
“This is strange.” Stated Sam as the former man now mermaid looked out the window of the monorail car they where in.<br />
“Not what you think of when you think of the lost city of Atlantis.” Confirmed Taylor as she moved beside her former boyfriend now girlfriend and watched as they passed over the city. They couldn’t even look up and see the surface, there was sunlight or something like sunlight. A large floating orb of energy hovered over the city giving off what was basically sunlight, but the entire city seamed to be underground which helped explain why it had never been found by humans.<br />
Finally they reached the hospital or maybe it was just an educational and indoctrination center because there didn’t seam to be any sick people when they exited their monorail and swam into a lobby. Instead of the directions to different medical wards or wings there where directions for different classes and cultural programs.<br />
“Alright, mermaids to the left, merman to the right.” Ordered one of the guards as a team of what they assumed to be doctors. “We need to do a medical check on all of you and get you settled, we will begin orientation and welcome you all to Atlantis tomorrow morning. Don’t worry we will arrange for you to be with your lover or lovers if you should request it.”<br />
There was a pause and the newly transformed merman Azumi seamed ready to fight or at least yell only to have her boyfriend Zack who is now a mermaid grab his shoulder and shake her head telling her to stop. With that they all separated peacefully into different rooms.<br />
The room was rather simple, a bench sat rather high on one wall with a long tube against one wall and a medical table. <br />
“Please have a seat.” Said one of the mermaids who wore a white tank top with a red cross on one side and a red crescent on the other, both signs of the red cross on the surface. The bench was high up because of their tails where much longer then their legs had been as a human. “I am Doctor Carline and we need to do a physical exam and do some testing before getting you settled.” <br />
She scanned the room at the five mermaids who had been humans only a few hours ago, three of them where topless and the two others had tops which where straining against their new larger mermaid breasts.<br />
“And once we get you all checked out we can go get you some new tops as well.” Said Doctor Carline “While it isn’t uncommon for a mermaid to go topless, it is still rare enough.” <br />
“I want to talk to someone about possibly turning back into a human.” Said Zack “I am a guy and I…”<br />
“Sorry but there is no going back to the human world.” Answered Doctor Carline “There is some hope however there is an experiment drug which would turn you into a merman but that hasn’t been cleared yet and given that we need mermaids to help repopulate Atlantis more then we need merman I have a hard time seeing the Council agreeing, but once we get you settled you can try to convince them.”<br />
Zack new beautiful mouth closed with a snap. <br />
“Alright, lets start the paperwork.” said Doctor Carline as she held up what looked to be a small mountain of paperwork. The paper was actually made of seaweed but it acted like paper and the pens where strange as well using something much like ink but not ink either. <br />
All five mermaids began to fill out the paperwork while Doctor Carline called each of them up, one by one to have some blood taken, then to be weighed, measured and the like. The large glass tube in the corner of the room was actually a scale. Each of the women where amazed at how much weight they had gained but Doctor Caline explained that was normal and most of it was either muscles or water, turns out both mermaids and merman had sacks of water in their bodies to control buoyancy. <br />
“Alright ladies, lets get you into the next room.” Said Doctor Caline as they were led into what was basically a mini mall. There a small team went to each of them, and they selected five tops for everyone to wear. It was a strange mix of tops from the human world, likely taken from cargo containers which had fallen overboard to ancient styles of cloths remade out of modern stuff to locally made cloths as well. One thing they learned fast was because their gills was located around their rib cages that had to remain free of any clothing to allow safe breathing. Everyone also would be given a belt or two which would have be used to carry bags/pouches on since merfolks didn’t have pockets.<br />
“I recommend you get something that laches in the front.” Advised Taylor to her former boyfriend now girlfriend Sam who was struggling to figure out how to put on a bra. <br />
“I guess that makes sense.” Said Sam as she took off the top and floated bare chested before her girlfriend, Taylor looked down and smiled at her loves new chest. “I mean I always found it easier to undo your top when you whore a latch on the front.”<br />
“True, and I will return the favor.” Whispered Taylor as she breast against Sam’s new breasts and placing her hand in the small of her back she pulled her into a kiss which earned a low moan. <br />
“Why don’t you two share a room together tonight, Nate and I can join you later.” Said Rose with a wink. <br />
“Works for me.” Said Taylor as she looked at Sam, who nodded, being in a poly relationship would be strange for all of them but Sam being a former man turned mermaid would have the biggest amount of change.<br />
“How do I look.” Said Amanda as the once shy women came out in an top which had a collar around her neck which held up two small strips of almost see through cloth which formed a V shape which only just covered the nipples on her now massive breasts before going to a metal piece which she wore just below her breasts but above her gills. It looked like something a stripper would wear not a choir girl and yet she was smiling to no end.<br />
“Good, but isn’t that really a big change for you?” inquired Rose<br />
“Who cares I want some merman dick; I hope Robert is ok with it since all of you seam taken.” Said Amanda unaware that everything that they were doing and saying was being watched by doctors to decide how far everyone was along in accepting their new lives.<br />
“You have changed don’t you see.” Said Zack as she floated they’re in a simple bronze colored top which went really well with her bronze color tail. <br />
“Yes, I am finally free of all that restraint I was put on, I can finally be a woman…well a mermaid anyhow.” Said Amanda.<br />
In the end Sam picked a simple black top with a silver lock on the front, it was simple, but it fit while Taylor and Rose picked up their own tops.<br />
Once everyone had cleared out they entered a third room to find the guys coming in as well, they where all bear chested but had belts as well with empty pouches just like the girls.<br />
“Aright lets get you all settled for the night and food will be brought to your rooms.” Said a doctor as two more pushed in a tray. “We have some multivitamins and others pills you will need to take to help with the transition.”<br />
“Alright.” Said Rose as they where each handed what was basically a weekly medication container, they even had the made in China logo on the back in plastic, clearly taken from some kind of ship wretch. Each of them had four small pills in each of days. What they didn’t know was that two of the pills increased their sex drive and increased the likely hood of impregnation, the goal was to get as many new babies as possible and they found children caused the fastest acceptance of merfolk hood. <br />
“Start with Monday tomorrow and we will…” started the Doctor as Taylor raised her hand.<br />
“Why is mine different then everyone’s else?” inquired Taylor as she held up hers, she had six different pills and they where all of different sizes/shapes and colors.<br />
“Well we where hoping to tell you this in private but…” started the Doctor “You are currently in the very early stages of pregnancy, so you require different medication to help make sure the baby grows correctly.”<br />
“What?” inquired Taylor as Sam’s eyes widened.<br />
“Your pregnant, a left over from your human life but a very welcomed left over.” Said the Doctor as he looked at the merman “Is one of them the father?”<br />
“No.” said Sam as she raised her hand “I am…I am going to be a father…no, is it a mother, I don’t know.”<br />
“A parent, we are going to be parents.” Answered Taylor as she swam up to Sam and pulled her into a deep embrace and an even deeper kiss.</p>
