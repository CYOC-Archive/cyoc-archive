<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Guy stretched out under the shower, waiting for the hot water to seep through his thick fur and down to his skin. Normally, he&#39;d be jerking off in the shower while he waited, but William completely wore him out last night. He had also had a bit of a high libido but he didn&#39;t know if that would be a regular occurrence from the slight human or it stemmed from excitement, he hoped the former. Instead he pressed a hand against the shower wall and just enjoyed the feeling of warm soaking.<br />
<br />
What even was this, it was barely a few days old and already they were going at it like a couple of rabbits in spring. And a boar? Wouldn&#39;t have been his first pick, but William was kind of the guy he had always wanted. Easy to be around, passionate about what he loved, and willing to listen to him play for hours on end, especially if he had a good book to read while listening.<br />
<br />
He grabbed his shampoo and poured some into his paws, lathering it up and releasing the scent of blackberries into the air. He began to work the shampoo into his fur, methodically. Humans had such a hard time figuring this part out, maybe he should just drag William here for a join shower and teach him once he furred up a bit more. He felt a purr starting in his chest at the thought.<br />
<br />
And he could bring William home. A few years ago his father would have flipped. He had been very keen on predator-prey lines in relationships. At least he had never been a single-speciesist. Those guys were nuts. But once his sister decided she was gonna marry a moose, well, that was the end of that. He was glad his father picked family over stupid traditions. Hell, he was adorable playing with Guy&#39;s little moose nephew.<br />
<br />
The problem was, Guy liked to take things slow. Think them through before he ran head long into a problem. This was not slow, this was a bullet train. He ran his paws down his fur, squeezing out the soapy water and grime as he did so. He should get William to join him, it was easier with two and he did love the feeling of clean fur. It was a quiet, calming ritual. A ritual where he always had trouble with his back. He turned off the water and gave himself a good shake before stepping out. This had not been when he expected when he volunteered to room with a transfer student.<br />
<br />
He stepped over to the fur dryer and in, starting to work undercoat conditioner in to his pelt as the dryer did its work. The Freshman had a group going through the change together, the figured friends and the RAs were enough. With the transfer students they wanted a local nearby to help them since they tended to be dealing with it alone. He had expected maybe a new friend, as a foreign student someone he could bond with about being far from home. Not.. this.<br />
<br />
He wrapped a towel around himself and headed back to the dorm. William was there and dressed, having showered before him. No shoes, he had packed those away almost reverently this morning now that he had hooved. Guy tried to make it to his bed, but there were hands on his fur almost immediately. &quot;Oooo, soft.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you get it messy again before class I&#39;ll be upset.&quot; Guy teased back, only to get a kiss on the side of his muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;No time, gotta get to class. Don&#39;t forget, you owe me some music tonight.&quot; And William was out the door in a flash.<br />
<br />
Guy needed advice. He grabbed his phone and dialed a number, putting it on speaker and tossing it on his bed as he dug out his claw kit. They needed blunting again. &quot;Guy!&quot; Came an excited voice on the phone. &quot;How&#39;s school so far?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; He sat on his bed, pulling his knee up against his chest to get to his foot claws, popping them out and grabbing his clippers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that&#39;s the I need advice voice.&quot; His sister, Anne, continued. &quot;One sec, I need to grab my tea.&quot; There were a few sounds in the background then a soft. &quot;Okay, what is it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When did you know Eti was the one?&quot; He knew right away the question was too direct.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Has <i>mon petit frère</i> found himself a boyfriend?&quot; She giggled airily. &quot;Spill, what is he? What&#39;s he like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Writing major, really into fantasy books and classical music. He&#39;s sweet. Little headstrong, but boars are like that.&quot; Guy rambled on, feeling a warmth inside of him as he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boar? I didn&#39;t know you liked bone in pork.&quot; Anne said with a mischievous tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;ANNE!&quot; He shouted, and he even heard the deep rumbling laugh of his brother-in-law in the back ground. He could feel his ears heating from pure mortification.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the way you&#39;re talking about him, you already sound smitten, and he sounds as big a nerd as you are, what do you need me for?&quot; Anne&#39;s laugh was a small tinkle next to the still wheezing guffaws he heard through the phone from Eti.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it a little.. quick?&quot; Guy asked softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick? You&#39;re dating, not getting married. Besides, you know the story I like to tell about our first date?&quot; Anne asked. &quot;Where we were waiting for a table and some rich old biddy comes in the restaurant and hands Eti her coat and he says..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Ma&#39;am, despite the antlers, I am not, in fact, a coat rack.&#39;&quot; Guy finished. He knew the story, but it still made his sister giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I almost peed myself, laughing. I knew right then I was probably going to marry him. You just know, trust that instinct. And try to bring him home over winter break, I want to meet him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guy had finished with his feet claws and was on to his hands. &quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do. I have to get ready for class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love you. And call mom. She worries if you don&#39;t.&quot; Came the usual ending admonishment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love you, too.&quot; He hung up and sighed, looking across to William&#39;s empty bed. It hadn&#39;t even been slept in last night. Maybe quick wasn&#39;t so bad.</p>
