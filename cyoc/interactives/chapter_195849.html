<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damian and Jenifer take a moment before cleaning themselves off in the shower. When they are done, Damian throws on some basketball shorts before walking over to his brother’s room to knock on the door. <br />
<br />
“Water is all your.” Damian says before walking back to his room. <br />
<br />
Draco and Susan look at each other. They new from their long showers that that meant they have already done the deed. <br />
“I guess we wait to see how he changes.” Draco says. “If he is like you, it should be by morning.” <br />
<br />
“Not much we can do about that now, cane we.” Susan says as she walks up to Draco. She rubs one of her fingers across his balls. “Didn’t you say that these were filling full.” <br />
<br />
“What did you have in mind?” Draco ask as Susan takes him into the shower. She turns on the water before pulling him underneath. <br />
<br />
“I want to see how much I can fit in my mouth now, after your last growth spurt.” Susan says before going to her knees. <br />
<br />
It didn’t take much for Susan to make Draco’s penis come out of his sheath. She licked the tip of his penis until it grew enough for her to place her mouth around it. She then started going up and down, making more come out. <br />
<br />
The penis grew to it’s six inches without the knot. Susan could tell she wasn’t going as far down it as before, but Draco could feel as much or more pleasure from it. “That feels so good.” He whispers.<br />
<br />
Susan pulls her mouth off of his penis to give is a long slow lick from bottom to top. “It’s only the beginning.” She whispers back.  She then pulls Draco down to the ground and continues to give him head while he is laying on his back in the shower. <br />
<br />
As she continues, Draco’s knot starts to pop out of his sheath. When it does, Susan stops with the head and moves her hips over Draco’s member. She slowly comes down on top of him, let him penetrate her. She then starts moving up and down his shaft. <br />
<br />
Both of their tails are waging in unison as Susan continues to ride him. It wasn’t long those before Susan went too far down and Draco’s knot was inside her. Susan let out a yip before covering her mouth. Draco smiles at Susan and she smiles back before they continued, Susan tugging on him. <br />
<br />
Before long, they both were reaching their climax. They covered their respective mouths as they both released. Like before, Draco’s knot didn’t let anything escape. Unlike before, Draco also seemed like he couldn’t stop cumming. Susan moans as her womb and stomach starts to press outward. Draco’s eyes goes wide as each pulse for his member made her stomach grow larger. He could hear her skin stretch as Susan’s belly starts to look more and more like a pregnant woman’s then a little girl’s. <br />
<br />
Finally, Draco stops. He looks at Susan with concern, not knowing if the water on her face is from the shower or tears. <br />
<br />
“Are you alright?” He asks. <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Susan replied. “It didn’t hurt, but it felt weird. It was like someone placed a water house up me.” <br />
<br />
They both stayed in their position, to afraid to move. Once Draco’s knot released Susan, all of their combined juices poured out of Susan. She looked like a water balloon that someone didn’t tie off. Her stomach decreased back to its normal size. No stretch marks or anything. <br />
Scared, the two finished their shower and went on to bed. What they didn’t know was Jeff had set a one time change the last time he was there for them, but he didn’t get a chance to watch them go at it again because they had smelt him. <br />
<br />
 As the night went on, Damian and Jenifer are asleep in Damian’s room. He starts to get a strange feeling and wakes up. <br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” Jenifer asks, as Damian turns on his lamp. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know. I feel weird.” He replies, taking off the covers. He looks down at his pants to fine that he is tenting hard in them. “What the hell?” <br />
<br />
Damian takes off his pants to find his penis erect and pulsing. His veins are visible on his member, pulsing. <br />
<br />
“I think you are changing?” Jenifer says as they both watch his normally five-inch member starts to stretch. <br />
<br />
In the course of a few minutes, he grows from five inches to eight. He moans softly as each pules stretches him a little at a time. When it reaches his new eight inches, he could feel barbs start to pop up all around his penis. While this is happening, his balls also inflate as fur starts to cover them. The fur moves up to his penis as a sheath of his own starts to form. <br />
<br />
Damian then arches back as his muscles start to twitch. Jenifer gets off the bed and lays Damian flat as his muscles start to grow and strengthen. As his muscles grow, the thin boy starts to look more athletic. His ears start to round out and move to the top of his head as a tail sprouts out from his butt. <br />
<br />
Finally, Damian’s body stops it’s twitching as he explodes his seed from his new penis. Damian is breathing heavily as Jenifer looks over his body, and the mess he had made. <br />
<br />
“I would ask if you would like to have more sex, but we already have a lot to clean up.” Jenifer jokes as Damian smiles at her.</p>
