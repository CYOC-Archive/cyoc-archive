<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kevin got up, satisfied from the actual completion of their sexual congress, he too slowly realized something more had happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Could it be...?&quot; He murmured to himself as he examined his body in the nearby mirror in the bathroom. Alicia slowly got up, walking in after him. Kevin took into account the new characteristics of his body. Sure his gut was a bit bigger, but his chest was a step closer back to actual pectorals, while still seeming a bit soft. A quick flex of his biceps showed a greater amount of tone and sheer size in his shoulders and arms, too. Even his legs seemed to have a feeling of greater strength to them. What Kevin didn&#39;t quite like so much was all the hair.<br />
<br />
He put in the effort to shave up, and present himself to his lovers as a smooth, handsome man. And while he was grateful his face wasn&#39;t affected, still being smooth, cleanshaven and handsome in his new way, he couldn&#39;t say the same for his body. But even as the transformation returned to him some element of his fitness, it had also undone his efforts at shaving up his body. Sure he could just shave back up again, but this was thicker hair than he&#39;d ever had before. And he might need some help with it whereas before he could handle it by himself. &quot;Both times...&quot; Kevin murmured, &quot;The change happened because we were having sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alicia felt her stomach drop, and she looked down. Once was a chance, twice was a pattern. She waited for the condemnation, the anger...which never came. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry that this...this somehow happened. If it&#39;s any consolation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn&#39;t have known,&quot; Kevin started, &quot;You were every bit as surprised as I was. Neither of us had any idea what was going on.&quot; Cupping his chin, Kevin looked the case over as he paced back and forth. He had no idea about the aging effect that had taken place on him, sure, but he just assumed that he&#39;d grown back into his fitness. In both cases the transformation seemed weirdly random - and triggered by sex. He couldn&#39;t see any pattern yet in the change itself, just in what triggered it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever had sex before, Alicia?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;...No. Never.&quot; She shook her head, &quot;My parents always stressed how dangerous, ugly and crude having sex were to me. But never said a word of it to my brother. What if they---what if they knew?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t make them justified,&quot; Kevin stated, &quot;They could&#39;ve just told you &quot;hey, if you have sex, your partner will end up changing or something&quot;. Not throwing some sexist bullcrap at you.&quot; He put an arm around her shoulder, &quot;We&#39;ll figure this out together. There has to be a reason for this. I mean, I doubt whatever weird sex magic you got swirling around is just there randomly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Accepting it was magic instead of some random occurrence was a big ask for Alicia, who had grown up without any real superstitious culture around her, having largely rejected her parents&#39; ideas. And besides, it was so far outside even the mythology her parents accepted as to seem more like they accidentally prevented her from inciting any changes than deliberately safeguarding any potential beaus.<br />
<br />
Yet as Kevin stood there nude beside Alicia he felt a strange tug toward her again. A sexual urge beginning again that he preemptively quashed - though the fact it left him feeling a distinct needy pulse in his manhood and with several fantasies about what more to do with Alicia left him wondering about the nature of this spell. He didn&#39;t say anything outright to Alicia because he wondered if there was an additional component on her too, considering how quickly they got back to screwing around earlier.<br />
<br />
Perhaps whatever was working on Alicia, it led to people wanting to &quot;complete&quot; the transformation. Given how readily even after learning about the curse on her, he was finding intrusive sexual thoughts tugging at him... Perhaps there was an end state to the changes. Some kind of state he was due to progress towards with every time he and Alicia fooled around. Maybe the changes weren&#39;t quite random... But whatever the end state was, Kevin just couldn&#39;t tell what it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...think I&#39;m gonna be heading home,&quot; Kevin stated, &quot;I&#39;ll be in touch, and we&#39;ll figure this all out together. But I---even with all that happened, for some reason I still feel tempted. I mean, I don&#39;t wanna chance anything further happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable...I&#39;m just, so sorry that everything happened like this.&quot; Alicia walked back over to her bed to take a seat. Just...sort through everything and try to figure out where she could go after this.<br />
<br />
Kevin walked back over, and gave her a chaste little kiss on the cheek, &quot;Don&#39;t worry babe, once we figure this out, dispel it, get rid of it somehow...we&#39;ll have all the sex we could want. I&#39;ll give you the night of your dreams. And that&#39;s a promise.&quot; As he got dressed in his suddenly a lot more tight clothes, struggling a bit with them, he looked back over at her and said, &quot;Keep an eye out in case anything further happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so Kevin walked out, and Alicia sighed. <br />
<br />
Just when she thought she was free of her parents and their byzantine nonsense, the world drops this number on her. She literally had a cursed vagina. Or...a cursed everything, going by how Kevin didn&#39;t even penetrate her really the first time they tried and he still ended up fatter for it. <br />
<br />
&quot;...Haah...what a horrible night to have a curse...&quot; She mused, and indeed, that night she texted Kevin - confirming he wasn&#39;t just leaving and never checking back in again after that experience - before doing nothing but watching tv, her favorite internet shows, and then falling asleep by her laptop after a desperate last attempt to find out about whatever happened to make her like this.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
If that night had been weird, the next week and a half were even worse.<br />
<br />
It seemed like after whatever happened that night, the floodgates had been popped open and for some reason, despite the college having so many other very attractive young women, she was the object of so many more men&#39;s attention now far more so than ever before. She walked to class that day distinctly aware of how every male head seemed to turn to look her way. Well, outside of the guys who were gay or otherwise uninterested in sex. But still - the sudden shift was quite alarming, and left Alicia wondering if she simply never noticed it before or if this was a side effect of the spell---curse---whatever.<br />
<br />
Yet as Alicia took her seat, waiting to see Kevin as usual, she found herself dealing with the most insistent of her new suitors. <br />
<br />
Poised with his hand on her desk, grinning eagerly, Alex Hollingswerth was almost archetypally the rich boy jock. Usually too up his own ass to bother her, it seemed with whatever was going on, he now found her worthy of his attention. He was tall, blond haired, green eyed, and while handsome, he had such an obvious ego in his presentation that Alicia didn&#39;t really see him as an option. His body was incredibly well muscled, visible even through the letterman jacket, red tank top and black short shorts he wore. However, it was clear through how his abs protruded quite a bit that Alex didn&#39;t have the patience to wait too long to get fit naturally.<br />
<br />
He also wasn&#39;t terribly shy about admitting to it - knowing that being a scion of such wealth, he&#39;d never actually face any discipline for blasting more trenbolone and dianabol than some bodybuilders. &quot;Hey Alicia, you&#39;re looking lovely today. You do something with your hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alicia sighed, &quot;No, and thank you, Alex. Though I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re so keen on me lately as opposed---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t really get it either,&quot; Alex admitted, &quot;But somehow, you&#39;re just looking so fucking hot lately. I mean, I&#39;m rich, I&#39;m ripped, we can be so fucking hot together. How about it?&quot; Honestly Alicia was tempted - after so many consecutive days of dealing with this - to just give Alex what he wanted - with all the warts attached, so to speak. She wondered what changes her curse might wreak on this elitist roidhead...though she quickly decided against it, as she had before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look, the teacher&#39;s coming in!&quot; She looked toward the door, and Alex quickly headed back over to his seat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gimme a call some time! You got my number!&quot; Indeed she did, as he&#39;d insisted on giving it to her a couple days prior. And while the teacher was indeed coming in, Kevin was following not too far behind and taking his usual seat. Alicia watched Kevin, who promptly smiled at her as he sat down. Due to what happened, she was eagle-eyed for any further changes happening to Kevin.<br />
<br />
And today...</p>
