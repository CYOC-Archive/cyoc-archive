<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carla, once known as Carl, was a post-op trans-woman. Her main issue was even with hormones and the surgery she just wasn&#39;t that happy with her social life. She just wasn&#39;t that convincing a woman and whether or not it was true or was just her paranoia, Carla often thought people were avoiding her and discriminated against her. Now she became a bit more introverted and spent most of her days in VR where her in game avatar could be closer to her in-game self. She had secluded herself so much that when she saw the Virtualization test she thought &quot;May as well... Even if I can&#39;t get back to the real world it&#39;s not like I&#39;m really a part of it...&quot;<br />
<br />
At the lab she knocked and entered and Dr. John said &quot;Hello there...&quot; Dr. John looked at his clip board that contained his volunteer test subjects on the list &quot;...Carla right?&quot; Carla nodded, &quot;Well this is my Virtualization prototype machine. I&#39;ve done intensive tests on animals before and they were successful so now we&#39;re just doing a few tests on people now that we think that it should work. The test will require you to disrobe before Virtualizing. During animal tests when we put rats in little shirts... There were complications, if this is an issue we can stop now.&quot; <br />
Carla said &quot;...That should be fine, this stuff is confidential right?&quot; <br />
Dr. John nodded his head, &quot;For records of the experiment you will just be a subject with a random number attached and a few details... You&#39;re a trans-woman right? For the sake of genetics and other parts of the data we&#39;ll put you down as ma-&quot;<br />
Carla blurted out &quot;I&#39;m a woman!&quot; <br />
Dr. John tapped his pen to a clipboard and said &quot;Sure you are, bigger issue is how the computer stores your data. It&#39;s going to not just take down your form but also keep a copy of you genetic code. Now I&#39;ve heard odd instances of XX chromosome males, but they are a small small minority. The computer will see you as male and as such I need to label you going in as male... going out however that could change.&quot; <br />
Carla&#39;s eyebrow raised and asked &quot;What do you mean change?&quot; <br />
Dr. John said &quot;During animal tests when we used a dog that was neutered, while it was data I managed to edit it&#39;s data to give it it&#39;s balls back. When it came back to the real world well... The dog was unneutered. It isn&#39;t a goal of this round of testing, but since we&#39;ve got some time in the virtual world I could make edits to your data. If you had regrets over the operation I could revert... or we could go the other direction. Try to make your approximation of a vagina into an actual one, do a few edits to your body structure, maybe turn your Y-chromosomes into X, and when you come out you... I suppose you&#39;d still be a Trans-woman, but you&#39;d be biologically indistinguishable from a born woman... probably, still ironing out kinks so it&#39;s possible there could be a side effect or two but the theory is sound.&quot; <br />
Carla started stripping and heading towards the Virtualization machine and said &quot;Yes let&#39;s do that!&quot; <br />
Dr. John said &quot;One moment!&quot; and went to his desk and pulled out a small form and said &quot;You&#39;re going to need to sign one additional consent form for the editing thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paperwork done Carla was in the Virtualization chamber naked, and then felt scared as the machine whirred up and started making strange noises and suddenly the chamber starting getting brighter and then... All Clara could see was a black square room with a green grid... said grid looked pretty large...<br />
&quot;Testing Testing, can you hear?&quot; said Dr. John&#39;s voice that seemed as if it were spoken in her mind. <br />
Carla asked &quot;Um, so did it work? This is the virtual world?&quot; the woman assumed that if this was the virtual world... Well having a way to directly talk to Carla would be real simple. <br />
&quot;Great communication both ways work. Yeah, these are early tests mostly to see if the technology works. I could get a flash drive and load up an rpg, but that&#39;s not really the point of this test right now. Heck this is probably a better place to edit you in cause you see the grid?&quot; <br />
&quot;How could I not?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well each grid is a 5 foot by 5 foot square, makes getting a general idea of your size a lot easier... now for step one...&quot; Carla stood near a wall as a copy of her appeared in an adjacent square... T-posing... &quot;Hey, we don&#39;t have the highest budget for an idle animation. It works well enough as a copy. For all intents and purposes except for consciousness it&#39;s a perfect copy of you. Just having it there in case the editing goes amiss and we want to quickly get you back to normal... Now then I&#39;ll start the editing so give me a bit...&quot; Carla stood excited and while she couldn&#39;t feel the changes happening the fact that she was shorter and the way her body felt was slightly shifting told her that she was being given a really female body. If Dr. John was being honest in preparation for the tests he had loaded up a few porn VR models and took one of the more slender bodies, gave it a tweak, and copied and pasted it from the neck down onto Carla. He figured it was good enough, he wasn&#39;t going to be the person to program in a working uterus and would probably need to copy and paste those from an actual woman, etc. But for Carla&#39;s purposes the first step of having all her internal organs and what not encased in a female looking form was good enough. The face however took a little more effort. Making the nose smaller, changing the jaws and cheeks, plumping up the lips a little, a few edits to the eyes, lengthening the hair... <br />
Dr. John said &quot;Ok Carla imagine you are holding a hand mirror.&quot; Carla did so and then a hand mirror appeared in her right hand, &quot;Alright, give yourself a look over and tell me if you want any small edits. This is going to be your body after all. Feel free to move around and see how it feels to you, again this is going to be your body you will need to live in. I can get you into further tests, but I&#39;d rather you feel comfortable in the skin you leave my office in.&quot; <br />
<br />
Carla looked herself over, nice skinny legs, plump thighs and ass, B-cup breasts, and her face... Was a little nicer than she had expected and she was happy with how the Doctor changed her as the base. She walked around, tried jumping a bit, and thought as she said-</p>
