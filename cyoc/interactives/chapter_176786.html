<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John got the brochure in the mail, along with the ads online, and the ads in magazine. The Island of Dolls. Located less than a mile off the cost. The ad was for a vacation, with the rates being incredibly cheap. But also due its nature came with several stipulations. But ultimately, it was the only vacation John and his family could afford.<br />
<br />
The boat ride over nothing to write home about, except that the entire crew were busty  anthromorphic rubber dolls. They were every color of the rainbow. They were completely nude except for items absolutely needed to show their rank or do their job (like the literally foxy captain wearing her white hat), and we also utterly devoid of sexual traits like you&#39;d expect from a doll. Their nipples were smooth, their crotches were completely flat and devoid of detail, and their rear were likely just smooth and round, lacking belly buttons to boot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great to have you aboard!&quot; said a literal ship bunny giving a salute. <br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t the only people on board. There were solo cases, businessmen, couples, salary men, and everything else. <br />
<br />
At least the food was good. <br />
<br />
As the ship docked on the island, the large TV screen in the mess hall flickered to life. <br />
<br />
On screen, was a white feline doll, wearing a royal rope and a crown, laying in a golden throne like a European monarch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome everyone! I, Princess Doll, welcome to you to my island, and your vacation not just from work, but from humanity and yourselves. For the idiots in the audience who skimmed over the disclaimer you had too sign on behalf of yourself or your family, I&#39;ll remind you that once you are transformed into one of us for your vacation, you will legally belong to me, for a doll needs SOMEONE to belong to be happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;To clue in said idiots who failed to read the disclaimer before signing, to enter the park proper, you will have to be turned into one of us. We provided all modern conveniences. However! You will have to leave all your personal affects behind. You will be legally forbidden from revealing your real names to anyone, including anyone you have come with after being changed. This legal agreement of not revealing your doll identity presists once you leave the island, if you chosen to leave of course. <br />
<br />
&quot;There will be no private internet nor any contact with the outside world. This is again to ensue our guests&#39; actions as dolls remain private. However we do provide all the major and minor streaming services. <br />
<br />
&quot;I say again, even if you came with multiple people, you are forbidden from revealing your identity. My dolls will be free to be just dolls. Also, as you can guess, you have no sex drive or sense of sexual attraction to ANYTHING or anyone once you become my dolls. I am NOT running that kind of resort thank you very much! And yes, as you guessed, our entire organization is made of dollies, we were all once human, but those lives mean nothing to us now.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is your chance to test drive that blissful existence of total love and total family for yourself. You won&#39;t need to use the facilities, sleep is mostly optional, eating is for nerds, you get the idea. I&#39;ll admit there are trade ins, but you get to experience what is to be a doll yourselves. I welcome you to my collection.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sharon glared at John.<br />
<br />
&quot;It really was the only vacation we could afford,&quot; John defended. <br />
<br />
Derrick grumbled, &quot;This is gonna be lame.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie laughed. &quot;This is gonna be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ship docked and the passengers were made too depart. The dock was lined with oversized statues of bronze, marble, and others, that were the same sexless style as the dolls.  <br />
<br />
The front of the park had a fountain with another doll statue at the center spitting up water in an arch. The entrance itself was a bright and golden gate. <br />
<br />
At the entrance  was a pair of identical tiger doll wearing police belts. <br />
<br />
They were also handing out blind folds. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here ya go, everyone needs to wear these going in, so you have no clue who is who going in what transformation booth. Don&#39;t worry, if you arrived as a group, you will be transformed next to each other but have no clue who is who if there is more than one companion. Hopefully this&#39;ll get you to see your friends and family are universal.&quot;<br />
<br />
John and Sharon looked at each other and nodded. Julia and Derrick shifted nervously. But this WAS a legal vacation spot with a gimmick, it wasn&#39;t like they were an evil world spanning organization. The Andersons had told their family and friends all were they were going and when. <br />
<br />
John put on the blind fold, and was led by the hand into a small booth where the blind fold was removed. There was a small panel on the wall and a box with your name, age, etc with the message &#39;Put all clothing and personal items here FIRST!&#39;<br />
<br />
You sighed, stripped, and did as you were told.<br />
<br />
The only options available was what species he&#39;d become and what color.<br />
<br />
You decided to go with monkey and bright yellow.<br />
<br />
As soon as you entered your options and confirmed, you felt a tingle go through you as you stood at attention. <br />
<br />
You felt yourself become lighter, your hair all vanished, your skin indeed turned banana yellow. Not only that, your skin became bright and shinny, a mold seam appeared around your arms and went along the whole of your body. You belly button vanished, followed by your manhood simply fading away, and feeling your rear end simply sealing up. <br />
<br />
Then you figure changed, hip widening, arms narrowing, along with your waist, in fact, no way a human being could have a waist like yours! A pair of giant breasts grew from your chest as well, like beach balls, and just as smooth and round. But then your feet shifted, becoming a second pair of hands. Next snaked out a tail that you could consciously control. You ears grew bigger and bigger, as your nose got smaller, and your mouth became round like a pair of coconuts. Your whole body felt built now for climbing rather than running. <br />
<br />
You felt dizzy... if you had to explain it, it was like your seat of consciousness wasn&#39;t in your brain anymore, in fact, you were pretty sure you didn&#39;t have a brain, or any internal organs anymore.  With each movement, you heard a faint squeak of rubber against rubber. <br />
<br />
The door opened, and you stepped into the light. <br />
<br />
The three dolls waiting for you were all the same height and figure as you, all looking incredibly attractive, but you didn&#39;t feel anything looking at them anymore than you did yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that you ... everyone?&quot; You asked unsure to how to address them. <br />
<br />
You tried to guess which one was which, but you realized to your shame that you never had wondered what your family&#39;s favorite animals were, it just wasn&#39;t important, you&#39;d never even gone to a zoo together!<br />
<br />
One was a bright purple mare. The next was a deer who was bright orange. And finally a pale blue rabbit woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is totally cool!&quot; Said deer doe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just want to say  you all look lovely,&quot; said the purple mare.<br />
<br />
The rabbit woman shook slightly. &quot;I... I guess this is alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
You might have been able to guess who they were from their reactions, but you had a feeling the park staff was watching for any break of secret identity. <br />
<br />
A silver and white husky doll with the same figure as you bounced into the room.  She had a clipboard in one hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright everyone. Welcome to your vacation of being a doll, free from pesky things like freedom of will, humanity, and other such things. We&#39;ll be now assigning you doll names, but please only use them in extreme circumstances. Part of the freedom here is freedom from yourself. We&#39;ll be able to identify you easy peasy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mare asked, &quot;We don&#39;t get to pick our own names?&quot;<br />
<br />
The husky said, &quot;Don&#39;t be silly, dolls don&#39;t chose their own names.&quot;<br />
<br />
All four of you stood at attention, a tingle running through you, right, you were a doll, a toy, an object, property, you weren&#39;t a person, why would you pick your own name? That was just silly. All four of you grinned.<br />
<br />
The husky pointed at the yellow monkey, &quot;Sunny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then at the same, &quot;Violet.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doe, &quot;Maple.&quot;<br />
<br />
And the rabbit, &quot;And Bouncy.&quot;<br />
<br />
And like lightning, it was absolutely true, he wasn&#39;t John, she was Sunny, her owner said she was, and therefore she was, a doll was what its owner wanted it to be. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you all understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Violet the purple mare doll.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Maple, the orange deer doll.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Bouncy, the blue bunny doll!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Sunny, the yellow money doll!&quot;<br />
<br />
They all sounded off. The husky clapped. &quot;Excellent. You&#39;ll be in the red doll house, room four! Now little dolls, go out and play and make our owner happy!&quot;<br />
<br />
None of them needed to be told twice and they bounced off into the park proper. It was truly like a toy town come to life, the building all looking giant pre-school toy imitations. It was a bright and sunny day, welcoming the new dolls to their vacation.</p>
