<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah came back down just as you finish eating and said &quot;Well Tanya is turning now. In 12 hours she will wake up a vampire. She's going to need clothes when she wakes up. She said that you'd know the type and size of clothes she wore at 15.&quot;<br />
<br />
You think back to when Tanya was 15 the first time. Tanya was still dressing you up as a girl at that time and she had told you her measurements. You smile as you remember that her breasts were a b cup at that age. You were always envious that Tanya was a girl and you weren't. Now she would be the envious one. Tanya only had a cup breasts when she was 13 and you have c cup breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you smiling about?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh just remembering Tanya's breast size&quot; you say. &quot;I had been envious of Tanya being a girl while I was a boy. Now she'll be the envious one because I'll have bigger breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now why would you say that?&quot; Dagger asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanya was always self conscious about the size of her breasts&quot; you say. &quot;She was an a cup at 13 and a b cup at 15. She didn't reach c cup until she was 18.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why were you envious of Mom being a girl Aunt Violet?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother started dressing me as a girl when I was six&quot; you say. &quot;The first time she did that I started to believe that I should have been born a girl. As her figure became more beautiful as she blossomed my belief became stronger. I didn't like the male body that I was born with and wished that I could be a girl. As you can see, I got my wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you freak out when I turned you then?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I never thought that my wish would come true&quot; you say. &quot;It was such a surprise that at first I couldn't believe that I was a girl, not to mention a vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I did tell you that I was a vampire&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only after we had sex for the first time&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have told you before that&quot; Sarah said. &quot;You would have believed me eventually when I proved it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's in the past now&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we going shopping or are we just going to sit here?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're going shopping&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now, it's just going to be us girls going. The guys will stay here and watch over Tanya. Well, if everyone is ready we'll go now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You, Alice, Megan, Sarah, and Dagger get into Sarah's mini van and off you go.<br />
<br />
On the drive to the mall Sarah said &quot;There are a couple of things that I need to mention. As we're going to be around humans we need to blend in. That means that you should be calling me Mother or Mom Violet. Megan, don't refer to Violet as Aunt Violet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I call you?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you had started to refer to me as Aunt Sarah before so go with that&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Alice, you know what to call me. Dagger, call me Sarah and not Head Council. By the way, what is your real name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Daphne&quot; Dagger said. &quot;My sister kind of named me after her favorite Scooby Doo character and my parents thought it was a nice name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Sarah said, &quot;everyone needs to refer to Dagger as Daphne.&quot;<br />
<br />
You arrive at the mall and you start to get a bad feeling. It's almost like there's a dark cloud hanging over the mall. You had felt this before and that time you were a part of a hostage situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah&quot; you say, &quot;I think we should skip the shopping for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you say that?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have this dark, foreboding feeling&quot; you say. &quot;I've had it once before and that time I was part of a hostage situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure that you're just nervous about being around so many humans in broad daylight&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now let's go in.&quot;<br />
<br />
You reluctantly go into the mall with the others. As you enter the mall the dark feeling grows stronger. You hope that Sarah's right about you just being nervous. The first stop you make is a mens clothing store to buy clothes for Jason and Brian. After that you head to a womens clothing store.<br />
<br />
As you're browsing through the dresses Megan asks &quot;Do you really think that something bad is going to happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do&quot; you say. &quot;That feeling grew stronger when we entered the mall. It's stayed constant since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think that we'll be taken hostage?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; you say. &quot;I just feel that something is going to happen. It could be that someone will come in and start shooting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's comforting&quot; Megan said. &quot;I don't want to be shot again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to be shot either&quot; you say as you pick out a few dresses in your size and a few in Tanya's.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope that we leave before whatever is going to happen happens&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
After you finish shopping Sarah suggests that you stop at the food court to eat. Just as you finish eating that dark feeling grows stronger again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to be caught up in whatever is about to happen&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Sure enough just as you finish saying that you hear gunshots ring out. Immediately after you hear a male voice over the PA system say &quot;Listen up. We have all the exits covered. As long as you do what we tell you to do no humans will be harmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh great&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to know that there are vampires among you&quot; the guy continues. &quot;I know that this is hard for many of you to believe but it's true. Now I want everyone to gather in the mall's central corridor and sit down. I will be there shortly to kill the vampires among you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do we do?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could try making a break for it&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; you say, &quot;we do what he wants us to do. If we try to make a break for it we'll be shot and we will be exposed then. Besides, Daphne will more than likely die if we do that. The safest thing to do right now is to do what that guy says.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Violet is right&quot; Dagger said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Sarah said, &quot;we'll go ahead and do what he wants.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you were discussing this you notice that no one in the food court had gotten up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you people stupid or something?&quot; the guy asked over the PA. &quot;Anyone who doesn't follow my instructions in the next five seconds will be shot. I don't think you want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was pandemonium as people quickly jumped up and raced to the mall's main hall to comply with the guys order. You, Sarah, Alice, Dagger, and Megan on the other hand got up as you normally would and walked. You see a little girl get shoved down by some guy. You walk over to her and help her up before she could be trampled. You didn't hear anyone calling for her so you told her to stay with you for the time being.<br />
<br />
Once everyone was sitting in the mall's main hall you see a guy approach you. &quot;You didn't panic and start running when I said you would be shot if you didn't do what I said. You even stopped to help this girl up. Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most injuries occur when people panic&quot; you say. &quot;As to why I stopped and helped the girl, I didn't want to see her get trampled. She is just a little girl after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not something a vampire would do&quot; the guy said. &quot;The only reason that I can think of that you would do that is that you were saving a source of food.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How dare you say that!&quot; you shout angrily. &quot;You don't know who I am or the first thing about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I know that you're a vampire&quot; the guy said, &quot;I can sense it.&quot; He looks to your left and his eyes rest on Megan. &quot;Ah Megan, it's so nice to see you again. Or it would be if you weren't a vampire. Your family is going to be devastated when they hear this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you think I'm a vampire Alucard?&quot; Megan asked. &quot;We're here in broad daylight and everyone knows that vampires can't go out in the daylight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are a few types of vampires that can&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
You take a good look at Alucard. He was pretty tall, around 6 foot. He had piercing blue eyes and jet black hair that was slicked back. He had a bit of a hooked nose and he had an aristocratic look about him. You could easily see that he could very well be descended from Vlad Dracul.<br />
<br />
Alucard's eyes come back to you and he says &quot;You intrigue me. What reason would you have to rescue this girl if it's not because she's food to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, I didn't want to she her trampled&quot; you say. &quot;You know, there are plenty of people around so it wouldn't matter to a vampire if one little girl was trampled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what intrigues me about you&quot; Alucard said. &quot;You are a vampire yet you don't act like one. Now I want you to open your mouth or I'll kill this little girl.&quot; He points his gun at the little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy!&quot; the little girl cried out suddenly.<br />
<br />
You know that Alucard is serious about his threat so you open your mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are your fangs?&quot; Alucard asked with a smile on his face. &quot;Extend them unless you want to see this girl die.&quot;<br />
<br />
You glare daggers at him but you obey and extend your fangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least you know how to take orders for a monster&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to see a monster, look in the mirror&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not the monster here&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really&quot; you say, &quot;you threaten to kill a little girl if I don't obey you. I'd say that makes you a monster to anybody here.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are some shouts of &quot;She's right&quot; from people around you.<br />
<br />
Alucard raised his voice and said &quot;I do what is necessary to rid the world of vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that includes threatening a little girl?&quot; you ask. &quot;It looks like you inherited Dracula's callous disregard for human life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I cherish human life&quot; Alucard said angrily. &quot;I want to preserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How does threatening a little girl do that?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;It got you to expose yourself to me&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You already knew I was a vampire before that though&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Alucard glared at you and asked &quot;So what if I did? These people wouldn't have believed me otherwise. Now it's time for you to go to hell where you belong monster.&quot; He pulled out a silver stake and plunges it into your heart.<br />
<br />
You feel immense pain from it as you look down at the stake protruding from your chest. Blood was soaking into Megan's shirt. You look up at Alucard and smile despite the pain. &quot;I'm not going to hell Alucard&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be dead and dust right now&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
You wrench the stake out of your chest causing you even more pain and the people around you gasp. You then toss the stake down at Alucard's feet as the wound closes and say &quot;You don't know everything about vampires. That silver stake would have worked on Dracula or other vampires but it doesn't work on my clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have wooden stakes with me too&quot; Alucard says as he plunges a wooden stake into your heart.<br />
<br />
It's just like the last time you were staked. You lose control of your bladder and bowels and you slump over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least she's dead now&quot; Alucard said. &quot;Now for the rest of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alucard stakes Megan, Alice, and Sarah and they slump down against you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that takes care of the vampires here&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
The little girl shakes you and says &quot;Please wake up.&quot; When you don't respond she takes hold off the stake in your chest and yanks on it. Amazingly it comes out and you sit up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it take to kill you?&quot; Alucard asked with a surprised look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going to tell you that&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll kill that girl if you don't&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
You stand up and place yourself between Alucard and the girl. &quot;We don't pose a threat to humans&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell that to the poor girl's family a member of your clan killed&quot; Alucard said. &quot;You know the one I'm talking about. She was found dead from a vampire bite yesterday morning along with a staked vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know that there were vampire bite marks on his neck also?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I fail to see what you're getting at&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
&quot;A vampire drank his blood, staked him, then impersonated him for three months&quot; you say. &quot;I know you've seen the tape. Was there a date on the tape?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes there was&quot; Alucard said. &quot;In fact the dates were over a three month period. Though I still fail to see you're point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps you're letting your feelings for vampires cloud your mind&quot; you say. &quot;My point is that it wasn't a vampire from my clan that killed that girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then what clan was that vampire from?&quot; Alucard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; you say, &quot;I was just turned a couple days ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then how can I take you seriously?&quot; Alucard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you take one who has been a vampire for 200 years seriously?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
You yank the stake from Sarah's chest and she stood up. She then said &quot;There are a couple clans that I know of that might be responsible. One is know as the Hollywood Vamps. The other is known as the Dracs. Both have the ability to impersonate someone from what I've heard over the years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know where I can find them?&quot; Alucard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know where you could find them&quot; Sarah said. &quot;From what I've heard they don't live in clan houses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So in other words they're scattered&quot; Alucard said. &quot;I'm still not convinced your clan isn't responsible for that poor girl's death though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did the vampiress you slayed to get that tape look like?&quot; you ask. &quot;Did she look like the survivor of one of the vampire attacks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can describe the one that I slayed&quot; Alucard said. &quot;As to if she looked like someone else I wouldn't know that. I haven't been able to see the one that survived the attack or even a picture of her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well why don't we go see the police then&quot; you say. &quot;We may be able to find out if the description matches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only way I'd go anywhere with you is if you wear special bracelets&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have my word that I won't attack you&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you won't be able to now&quot; Alucard said. &quot;I have an amulet that creates a magical bond when someone gives me their word. We'll go see the police.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then you hear sirens outside and you say &quot;It sounds like the police are already here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then Alucard's cell phone rings. &quot;Hello&quot; he answers it. &quot;I know about the situation in the mall... Oh there are vampires here... Yes I'm in the mall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's holding us hostage&quot; several people shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not what you think&quot; Alucard said after a few seconds. &quot;I wasn't going to hurt anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He threatened to kill a little girl&quot; several people shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't really serious about that&quot; Alucard said. &quot;I just said that to get a vampiress to reveal herself... I wouldn't have killed the girl... I can't allow you to take me in... I was going to release everyone but now I don't have the incentive to release them... I wish that it was different too... Let me and my men walk away and they will be released... I will release them without harm... I've staked the vampires but they won't die. I'm sorry to say that one of them is Megan... Well yes, I did stake her... Now there's no reason to make threats... I don't think she's dead if she's like the other two vampiresses... I'll ask. Is either of you two Sarah or Violet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Sarah&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I'm Violet&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both of the ones that are up say that they are them&quot; Alucard said. &quot;Ok I'll let you talk to her.&quot; He holds the phone out to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Dad&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Violet, I need to know if Alucard was serious about his threat to kill that little girl&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes he was&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he stake Megan?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes he did&quot; you say. &quot;He also staked me and Sarah as well as Alice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well put him back on&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
You hand the phone back to Alucard.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds Alucard says &quot;Your step-daughter is 36... That can't be... When you're turned you stay the same gender and age... What do you mean that they can choose the age and gender?... Violet used to be your step-son?... I won't just come out and give myself up. I have too much work to do. I need to rid the world of vampires after all... I'm done talking. Either you let me and my men walk out with no arrests or I keep the hostages in here... Then I'm afraid that I have to say good bye.&quot; He hung up and said &quot;Well it looks like you're all going to be here for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that you've made a huge mistake just now&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't be arrested&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may end up dead&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
A man comes up and says to Alucard &quot;I'm giving up and so are most of the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, go ahead and give up&quot; Alucard said. &quot;Since you want to give up you can just sit down with the hostages.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another guy says to Alucard &quot;We should just kill them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to kill anyone except vampires Kevin&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're soft&quot; Kevin says pointing his gun at Alucard and firing.<br />
<br />
Alucard just manages to fire his own gun before Kevin shoots. Both go down and you can sense that Kevin was dead. Alucard was still alive though.<br />
<br />
As you bend over him he says &quot;I don't want to die. I need to rid the world of vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're dieing and help won't get here in time&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can turn him&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that's the only way I can continue my mission, then so be it&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Sarah said, &quot;we'll have Alice turn you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah must have pulled the stake out of Alice's chest since she came over and straddled Alucard.<br />
<br />
Alice undid Alucard's pants and began having sex with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Alucard asked. &quot;I thought you were going to turn me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we are&quot; Sarah said. &quot;This is part of how we turn people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange way to turn someone&quot; Alucard said.<br />
<br />
Alice was really going at it. Finally she seemed to orgasm and she bent her head down to Alucard's neck. &quot;Now comes the second part of turning you&quot; she said and bit his neck.<br />
<br />
You sense Alucard stabilizing as Alice finished.<br />
<br />
Just then the police came in shouting &quot;Nobody move!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your step-father comes over and asks &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of Alucard's men said they were giving up but one said that they should be killed&quot; you say. &quot;Alucard disagreed and they shot each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is Alice doing on top of Alucard?&quot; Your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She turned him&quot; Sarah said. &quot;It was the only way that he'd be able to continue his mission as he called it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that a wise thing to do?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I kept him the same it wouldn't have been&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How old did you make him?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I decided to make him six years old and a girl&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
I don't think he's going to be too happy about that&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least this way he won't be able to do much damage&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This could come back and bite us&quot; Sarah said. &quot;It's too late to change it now though. We'll just have to make the best of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan still has a stake in her and I'm unable to remove it&quot; Dagger said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll remove it&quot; you say as you start to go over to Megan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't move or I'll shoot!&quot; one of the officers shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead and shoot then&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
You keep going over to Megan and the officer fires. You're hit five times before your step-father is finally able to stop that officer. Getting shot hurt but you continued on toward Megan. You kneel down next to Megan and yank the stake from her chest.<br />
<br />
Megan sat up and said &quot;That was weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's basically like you die&quot; you say smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard gunshots&quot; Megan said. &quot;Did you get shot Violet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you can call me Aunt Violet now&quot; you say, &quot;and yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you're right, they know we exist now&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
The officer who shot you was standing with his mouth open as were other police officers. The one who shot you suddenly said &quot;You should be dead. I shot you five times. One of those bullets hit your head. And how did you sit up after that stake was pulled from your chest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're vampires&quot; your step-father said, &quot;real vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But there's no such thing as real vampires&quot; the officer said. &quot;The only vampires are those wackos that think they're vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you explain what you just saw then?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't explain it&quot; the officer said. &quot;What they've done is impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to open your mind more&quot; your step-father said. &quot;You saw what happened so it's not impossible. Sarah, Violet, Megan, Alice, and you&quot; your step-father said pointing to Dagger, &quot;you five will have to come down to the station with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could we get cleaned up first?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you need to clean up?&quot; your step-father asks you. &quot;From what I can see your shirt has a big hole in it and blood on it. Other than that I don't see why you would need to get cleaned up and we've seen worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we were staked and that puts us in a death like state&quot; you say. &quot;That includes the loss of bladder and bowel control. It's just gross.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well like I said, we've had worse&quot; your step-father said. &quot;I'm sorry, but we need to go now. You'll just have to clean up later. Sergeant, when the medics arrive make sure that they leave Alucard alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir&quot; a Sergeant said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now get in my car&quot; your step-father said.</p>
