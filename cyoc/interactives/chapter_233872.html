<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After closing the front door, I didn’t have to travel far to run into someone. it was Alex the girl I turned into a boy putting on his pants and tying up his shoes in the dining room.<br />
<br />
“Last time I checked the Incredible Hulk didn’t wear any shoes.” I commented getting his attention. Alex finish tying up his shoes and looked up at me. He smiled as he got up.<br />
<br />
“Morning Joey.” Alex greeted as he had out his hand. I took it and shook it.<br />
<br />
“You had a good night being like this?” I asked him curious if his opinion or rather if he wants to be turned back.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Bailey was a bit domineering, but at least she took it slow.” Alex said what a smile. So Bailey is the name of the junior cheerleader that had sex with him.<br />
<br />
“So I take it that’s one of the reason you would want to turn back into a girl; I could make you even a beautiful one?” I asked Alex hoping the gauge his current mental state. So far nothing the international cheerleaders asked to be turned back to normal so I wanted to run it by with one of the only other people I changed.<br />
<br />
“No I’m good like this plus it is the best thing that has happened to me.” Alex declared and I gave a confuse look.<br />
<br />
“Really? How so?” I asked, and to my surprise, Alex shifted a bit as he was afraid to admit he was about to admit. Taking a breath, he looked at me.<br />
<br />
“This isn’t the first time I had sex. Well, it’s the first time I had it as a guy but prior to last night I’ve had sex as a woman before.” Alex, confess and I looked at him dumbstruck.<br />
<br />
“Seriously?” I asked only for Alex to nod.<br />
<br />
“It was pity sex from a jerk who said that might as well have it with him otherwise no man would have it with me. To be honest, it was a mistake that I regretted afterwards.” Alex continued. And that was an interesting tidbit from him.<br />
<br />
“So you’re saying you prefer having sex as a man then being a woman. Why?” I ask curiosity.<br />
<br />
“When I was a girl, and when I had sex, it was so uncomfortable and felt so violating to have something be inserted into me. Now when I had sex with Bailey last night, I can understand why guys feel good when they insert their cocks into the girls vaginas. The feeling of inserting something in the sense of domination feels just right. I liked it way much better than having something inserted into me.” Alex explain as if he was trying to describe something without our visual aid.<br />
<br />
“You sure because it seems that Bailey was the one that was dominating.” I joke and chuckled. Alex respond was to playfully shove me.<br />
<br />
“Anyways I wouldn’t have it any other way it wasn’t for Bailey; she was slow to help me through that I mean, given that we are friends I didn’t expect much but boy it felt amazing.” Alex answered ignoring the joke.<br />
<br />
“Wait you two are friends?” I asked and Alex just nodded in respond.<br />
<br />
“Childhood friends. Now, probably best friends even more. Thanks by the way for my new life.” Alex answered. <br />
<br />
“Oh how come?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Well as I slept memories of my new life came in. It’s not 100% complete, but I have enough to grasp what my new life is and compare to contrast my old life. Thank you for turning me into a boy. It really fix my family life.” Alex declared. I raise an eyebrow in confusion. Alex took a deep breath as if he was going to explain his entire backstory.<br />
<br />
“You know when I originally look like right?” Alex asked and I nodded before he continued. “I was not very feminine and as if to add insult to injury I do enjoy boy activities, more than being a girl. My dad was more than happy than I enjoy boy activities but he always wanted a son. Mom always wanted a girl to spoil and to practically dress up. She really was upset of how I came out.” Alex took a breath before continuing.<br />
<br />
“So five years when it showed and I may not be the cute little girl that Mom always wanted; my parents try again for another child and that resulted in my little sister. Mom was over the moon having little Angel but my father was disappointed. Shortly after my sister‘s birth, my dad would always try to insist that they try again for another child. However, Mom just kept making excuses and just recently, we learned that she had her tubes tied.” Alex explained in venom.<br />
<br />
“I bet that pissed off your dad.” I commented.<br />
<br />
“Yeah he and Mom have been fighting so often and threatening with divorce. However, thanks to you turning me into a guy that has never happened. Sure Dad was happy and it was Mom who begged him to have another child which resulted in Angel. So both of my parents are happy.” Alex said smiling I then noted something he said earlier.<br />
<br />
“Earlier, you commented that you and Bailey were friends?” I asked Alex’s smile grew more.<br />
<br />
“Yeah Bailey Jackson was my childhood friend, but after entering middle school, we had to keep our friendship a secret because you know good looking girl and I was a butt ugly girl. I was understanding plus you see how popular Bailey is now?” Ask Alex and I nodded in respond. “It’s one of the reasons why when I became a boy she stuck close to me and last night we surprisingly punched our virgin cards.”<br />
<br />
“And your new memories of her?” I commented.<br />
<br />
“And her’s as well, after all her new memories of me came in as she slept as well. we were still childhood friends, but we never really kept our distance from each other after elementary school. We were best friends nearly inseparable to the point that it literally takes our other friends to tear us apart. We shared everything with each other our hopes our dreams. She’s planning to go to a technical school and move into the countryside and inherit her grandparents farm.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds like a wholesome girl.” <br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Alex interjected looking love struct. “In this reality, she is my girlfriend. I love her and she loves me. I’m gonna enroll into another technical school involving business after high school and help her run that farm. I’m going to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa dude, that’s…that’s…I admit that is surprising after having one night of sex with each other.” I commented. Alex chuckled a bit.<br />
<br />
“Our new memories, kinda makes it hard, not to fall in love with each other. In fact, the entire reason for the way she acted last night during our passion was more of revenge.” Alex chuckled before continuing. “Apparently in this new timeline, we were supposed to come to this party as a costume pair. I was supposed to be a steer to her cow she got pissed when I came as the incredible Hulk.” This got me laughing as well. <br />
<br />
<b>Ding-Dong</b><br />
<br />
This got me out of my laughter as I looked towards the front door and panicked.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Crap.’</i> I thought I ran through who could this be. To my knowledge, the rest of the guest should be getting up, getting dressed, and leaving soon. So who was back ringing the doorbell? Remembering that now there are two babies in this house and I know how Mrs. Brockman is like when she is angry. I turned my attention back to Alex.<br />
<br />
“Do you know where the bathrooms and some of the bedrooms are right?” I asked Alex. Alex looked at me confused about the whole doorbell and why I was acting this way, but nodded in confirmation. “You and Bailey corral as many as the party guest that are left here into those rooms so they can get dress. I’ll hold off and entertain the person at the door.”<br />
<br />
“Why?” Ask Alex.<br />
<br />
“With Jessica a baby now that doorbell should’ve woken her up and you do not want to see an upset or angry Mrs. Brockman.” I answered as I rushed to the front door. I open up to answer who was at the door.</p>
