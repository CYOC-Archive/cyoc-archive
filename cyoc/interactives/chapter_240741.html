<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Inspired by RealityVirus’s toon infection branch</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy looked at the strange machine. It seemed far too elaborate for a simple prank.<br />
<br />
“This can’t be real, though. It’d be locked away, or the government would get rid of it, or something…” she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
However, her curiosity got the better of her. She decided to explore the machine.<br />
<br />
She went through hundreds of options on the machine’s included touch screen. However, one caught her eye.<br />
<br />
“The porn obsession virus.” She read to herself. She grimaced. <br />
<br />
Amy had broken up with her boyfriend, Maxwell, over her last break. The two had been inseparable throughout high school, and had stayed together when Amy went away to college. During this last break, though, Amy had decided to surprise her boyfriend by coming in to his house unannounced. To her shock, she found him watching lesbian porn and jerking off. Amy had angrily gone through his computer and found tons of lesbian porn, and somehow more upsetting, hentai with Futanari characters.<br />
<br />
After a heated argument, Amy left Maxwell, returning to her dorm and crying herself to sleep. <br />
<br />
“So you want porn over me, Max? Well, let’s see how much you like a porn virus!” She said, angrily clicking the preset.<br />
<br />
Amy was surprised at how detailed the program was. This particular transformation was mental only, making every subject that sees it obsessed with pornography. She adjusted it, making it exclusively “lesbian porn and hentai and futanari hentai.” Then, she saw a box marked “physical transformation.” <br />
<br />
A 3D model appeared on the right side of the screen, and the options menu was minimized and put to the left. She decided that the hosts of this virus would change into the 3D model; she looked at the naked 3D model. It was clearly a porn star. The model had big, round breasts, a fit torso, and wider than average hips, with a plump rear to finish off the look.<br />
<br />
Amy, in her anger, decided to make the model more exaggerated. She upped the breast size, the size of the model’s rear, the hips, and the model’s lips - she also gave the model a comical amount of makeup. Anyone infected by the virus would gain all of these attributes, and Amy settled the breasts to be, at a minimum, G cups. After all, the porn stars Maxwell was watching were unusually comically sexed up, and she wanted this model to be just as slutty.<br />
<br />
Just because she could, she decided to add another alternate transformation. For Males, they’d have the same changes, but above their new vaginas, they’d keep their penises - which would grow significantly. A second 3D model appeared next to the first, identical except for a 16 inch penis and tennis ball sized testicles.<br />
<br />
She decided to add in some transformation parameters. “Amy’s porn slut virus will infect individuals 18 or older. It will cause the subject to resemble the most extreme of porn stars. They will lose all body hair, their hair and makeup will be always be slutty and perfect, and instead of having to use the bathroom, subjects will create excess cum and breast milk. Instead of a foul smelling body odor, the subject’s body odor will smell of strong perfume, which has an aphrodisiac effect. The more the subject sweats, the stronger the effect. For women, they’ll become an extreme porn star version of themselves. Men will change gender, including personal details like names and pronouns, but will keep their penises; otherwise, they’ll look very similar to infected females. In doing so, men will become ‘futanari,’ a biological female with both a vagina and a penis.”<br />
<br />
Content with the physical changes, Amy moved on to mental changes. Along with the previous “porn addiction” symptom, she decided to add some additional changes. <br />
<br />
Amy decided that all infected will develop a high libido. An infected individual will mentally become a slut, choosing clothes that will exemplify their porn star assets; they will love revealing, sexy clothes, including sheer dresses, bikinis, and other “porn star” clothing. Even when they’re wearing “regular” clothing like sweatsuits or yoga pants, they’ll expose as much skin as possible. Anyone infected will still retain their core personality and intelligence, but “sluttified.” They’ll start watching massive amounts of porn, their favorite past times will be sex and masturbating, and they’ll love flirting and picking up women. Monogamy will no longer be considered “normal” among them, and none will be in “closed” relationships, preferring multiple sexual partners as well as threesomes and orgies. Infected individuals love their changes and will mindlessly masturbate many times each day and will be obsessed with lesbian pornography and futanari hentai.<br />
<br />
Finally, the machine asked Amy how the virus would spread, which symptoms the infected had, and if the transformations would be permanent. Amy was exhausted from all she’d done and was getting kind of sick of playing around it, plus she had to get home. She decided to let the machine do it for her. The machine decided the symptoms will be a cold; the infected will get a fever, infected females will leak breast milk, infected futanari will leak both breast milk and pre-cum. The virus will be both airborne and transmissible through bodily fluids; the infection will have a strong infection rate, both due to raised libido and its airborne pathogens. The machine selected that the transformation would be permanent and that the transformed host would still be contagious - in addition, infected subjects will be permanently contagious.<br />
<br />
Amy hit enter. With all the parameters entered, the machine whirred and the doors automatically opened. “VIRUS READY. PATIENT ZERO ENTER CHAMBER,” the machine said. <br />
<br />
Amy was a bit cautious, but complied. The door shut behind her, making her jump. Finding the door locked, Amy decided to stand in the designated area.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a strange mist was sprayed at her from all angles. The spray smelled like the strongest mixture of perfumes she’d ever experienced; it was like a department store on steroids. Amy coughed as she was assaulted for what seemed like hours; after about ten seconds, it let up.<br />
<br />
The doors released and Amy stumbled out. “What the fuck was that?” She cursed out. She looked at the screen. <br />
<br />
“PATIENT ZERO INFECTION COMPLETE! THANK YOU FOR USING THE VIR-O-MATIC!” The machine’s screen read. “Yeah, bullshit.” Amy said, lightheaded from the machine. She decided to look for Lina.<br />
<br />
Finding her in the back of the store, she tapped Lina on the arm, who was playing on her phone.<br />
<br />
“Hey, I was gonna grab you, but you looked so focused. Wait… what happened? You look like shit.” Lina said.<br />
<br />
“It’s nothing. Let’s go back.” Amy said, a bit dismissively. <br />
<br />
“Finally. I thought we’d never leave. Let’s get some food on the way back.” Lina said.<br />
<br />
Amy just nodded and let her friend drag her around, feeling a bit of scratchiness in her throat…</p>
