<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah turned back to face Petra, her eyes peeling in suspicion and lips thinning into a cunning smirk at having divulged something her friend fruitlessly feigned. Not yet realizing her gig was up, Petra tried to act baffled with her widened eyes and loosely agape mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it? Why are you looking at me like that? Y-yeah that&#39;s the spell book I used. I just brought it to show you. I really didn&#39;t intend to-or I mean- seem to make it look like I intended you to have to do something...or anything like that I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra&#39;s refute at being caught wavered and quieted the further she tried to dissuade Sarah&#39;s suspicion. But it wasn&#39;t behind a shallow motive. The idea of Sarah joining her in being transformed had only hatched in her mind as she drove over, but maybe it was an idea her subconscious bore much further back in time. As amazing as her feline form was, it did make her feel quite alone and somewhat anxious at the prospect of having to face society by herself as something severely against the grain of normalcy. Having someone as confident and strong as Sarah also as a &#39;deviant&#39; really brazened Petra in the idea of their solidarity. Of course it wasn&#39;t something she would want to force onto her best friend, but it felt impossible to not have at least considered.<br />
<br />
Petra&#39;s guise of ignorance softened and fell away, her ears folding down like that of a delinquent kitten caught in the act and her eyes dropped down from Sarah&#39;s own glaring pair. She stared at the floor as she awaited the chastisement she felt was imminently coming. But as the seconds passed and nothing met her ears, her sullen composure turned into fidgeting before which a response met her ears.<br />
<br />
Chuckling filled the silence and her whole body snapped up straight again to regard her friend&#39;s unexpected reaction. Sarah then reached her hand out and laid it onto her friend&#39;s cheek, lightly grazing her thumb across her soft skin. Petra already conditioned to being pet, leaned into her caress and stared intently at those now playful eyes in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah like you just happened to lug that book with you all this way to only show me it and that&#39;s it, show&#39;s over. I was going to lay into you there for trying to play coy around me like that. But then I thought better of it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s eyes grew slightly out of focus as she lengthened her gaze out somewhere farther than the furthest wall of the living room. In her head all the while Petra sat confused, Sarah had mulled over the slyly insinuated request. At first she thought it an impulsive act of Petra&#39;s to wish her to join her on the wild side. To just drop the human form she&#39;d become quite accustomed to her whole life in the favor of something unconventional to say the least held a ton of weight, not to even mention the way it would drastically reshape life around her. But the more she substantiated the image of them together in her mind, bound in the comradery of their anomaly and free to live however they wanted as their personal rebellion to the world, the warmer her regard to it became. She always had been on the fringe of society and whatever circles she came into because of her unfaltering convictions and nature. Making this physical change wouldn&#39;t add more alienation to what her behavior already was sufficient in endowing. But on top of all that, one element tempted her the most to go through with it. The illustrious idea of the two of them sharing intimacy in their partially furred and feline bodies with all the ensuing shared petting and other things more lewd between them sparked a newfound desire in herself she did not expect. Her passion toward consummating with Petra where she herself could also be a Catgirl equipped to enjoy the same pleasures lit a fire she knew would never blow out, it&#39;s heat rapidly reaching her face with light pinpricks and tightening her throat. Deep in the revelry of fantasizing their intertwining bodies and appendages, she didn&#39;t even realize she had already made up her mind.<br />
<br />
At this point the cat that sat across her was completely lost at what her friend was thinking. Petra&#39;s eyebrows furrowed and her lips tightened in restless bemusement, the leaps of her friends demeanor from accusation, to humor, and now to a look of yearning culminated in Petra something a bit short of impatience. She scooted herself up against Sarah&#39;s side and pawed her palm over her thigh to bring her back from the seeming trance that had taken her. <br />
<br />
Sarah blinked with a quick shake of her head and let a gentle smile spread across her face as she regarded her expectant friend, or more of a lover at this point. She clasped her own hand over where Petra&#39;s lay and sighed out with a slight hiccup of excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that you don&#39;t have to hide what you want from me, right? All those times when we&#39;d hangout or have a sleepover here and I&#39;d be shuffling through games and movies, I&#39;d always ask you which you&#39;d like, and it&#39;s always the same thing from you. You flick your eyes away and mutter &#39;I dunno&#39;, but I knew that you had something in mind. So I&#39;d flip through all of them, pretending to really deeply consider the facets of each one I held, but really I was watching you instead. Because I knew that once I laid my hand on the one you wanted, your eyes would flick really quickly to it and then back. I never let on that I noticed, but I did. I guess after the hundredth time you just get used to the fact that your friend also happens to want to watch re-runs of that one god awful show you like so much. The cat&#39;s out of the bag on my little trick now though, pun definitely intended. But I feel like I won&#39;t need to rely on that anymore. Because this time, we really do have our eyes on the same thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The whole speech had kept Petra on edge both emotionally and as to how she sat on the coach, those warm comfortable memories playing back through her head as she hung to what point Sarah was getting to, and just as she rounded the end of that resolute final statement, she burst. Pure joy abounded in her heart, shooting her up and off the sofa and landing her right onto Sarah&#39;s lap with her knees straddling her thighs. Sarah jerked in reflex to the sudden pounce, but then right away melted into the same bundle of ecstasy that her lover had become, the sight of her wide bright eyes and enormous toothed smile alone propelling her heart to the same level. Petra so consumed in her jubilation couldn&#39;t hold back her own love either, and with wrapping her arms around Sarah&#39;s back, pulling her torso off the couch, she then firmly planted her lips down onto Sarah&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Fireworks went off in both of them. The surprise in Sarah that had been following each of Petra&#39;s explosive motions did nothing to jar her embrace. She pushed back into the kiss with equal fervor her as she wrapped her own arms around her lover&#39;s lower back to press their chests as tightly together as possible. Closing their eyes, their tongues met and danced together, gliding from one another&#39;s mouthes as their bodies squirmed and gyrated against each other. Their noses struggled for enough air in their intense exchange, the pressure and friction onto one another&#39;s breasts additionally interspersing their desperate draws for air with moans. All the while, Sarah could very apparently feel both by the generated wind on her face and the rapid tensioning of muscles in Petra&#39;s back that her tail was in an absolute frenzy. It made her lust for the potential of her own to come very soon. <br />
<br />
For Petra this moment was another layer in her dream come true. Not only had she acquired her own dream form, but now she had the one she loved most to share in it. As they kissed, all of her body&#39;s sensations felt as if they were intensely magnified. Everything from the warmth of Sarah&#39;s bosom and the pressure of her firm embrace upon her back, to the smell of lavender in her hair and the the reverberation of her rising heartbeat echoing her own was as sweet and decadent to her as honey. With her immense elation, she didn&#39;t even realize the reaction her illustrious tail was making and how tempting it was to the one seeing it over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
Drawn to it, Sarah shifted one of her hands down slightly to reach its base, and from her infatuation of Petra&#39;s past reaction, she squeezed her hand around it through the fabric of her skirt. The wild appendage immediately stiffened, its owner also suddenly arching her back and craning her neck up and out of their kiss. Something between a guttural moan and a strained mewl flowed out of her agape mouth, Petra paying no heed to its volume. Sarah felt her shudder and she moved her kiss down onto the side of her lover&#39;s neck, knowing full well she was driving her absolutely insane with pleasure. <br />
<br />
The surge of pleasure procured between the attention to her tail and her neck was unprecedented. Petra felt all of her muscles down from the responsible appendage to her lower back and nether region suddenly grow immensely hot and tense. The only rational thought in her mind was to wish the grasping hand and suckling lips would never detach. Even that, she could not hold in her mind for long before her sight became blurry and hearing went distant.<br />
<br />
Through the intense haze of their ecstasy, Sarah noticed an immediate moisture reach the skin of her abdomen and almost burst herself at realizing how wet what she did made Petra. She let go of the immensely erogenous tail and unstuck her lips, leaving behind a hickey on her lover&#39;s neck, and just held her shoulders as she caught her breath. Between her lust and their combined exertion, she had become slightly dizzy, the same affliction also in her lover to an even larger degree. Sarah felt Petra start swaying unsteadily before beginning to topple over to the side, her still strong grip taking Sarah with her until they both fell on top of each other at the end of the couch.<br />
<br />
A few moments later Sarah had regained her faculties and was met by the lovely sight of Petra below her. Chest heaving, mouth splayed wide open in a dopey smile, and eyes way of focus as made apparent by the slits of her pupils being widened to nearly circles, she was absolutely irresistible. Sarah couldn&#39;t help but lay her hand onto one of those hot and flushed red cheeks to try to stir her lover back to earth. A couple more heavy breaths and Petra did eventually find ground, shocked to find herself now suddenly horizontal with her lover tenderly looking down at her. Meeting her eyes and glancing down, she realized that she had left quite a mark of her nectar before then momentarily fainting. Petra would have blushed, but her cheeks could not possibly get any redder at the moment. Taking a gulp, she found control of her tongue again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah that was the best thing I&#39;ve ever felt in my whole life. I&#39;m sorry I made a mess but I didn&#39;t expected that in the slightest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah looked down at her shirt to see a large soaked region where Petra had pressed herself onto her just moments ago. With a careless smirk and quick resolve, she grabbed the bottom hem and pulled the whole thing off of her, making a very delightful presentation of her bosom to the glee of Petra beneath her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m glad my shirt took it all since rather than you helping me transform, we&#39;d be trying to clean these couch cushions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thrill once again rekindled in Petra at that mention. This wasn&#39;t even the precipice of the evening since she still has yet to savor the experience of her lover getting her own feline makeover. She licked her lips and fangs at the thought of watching it happen, getting to touch and feel everything as it grows once again as a way to relive her own transformation, but this time from a different perspective. However, before she could say anything to move forward on that, her ears perked up to hear something. It was the sound of footsteps going up to reach the front door and they were getting close.<br />
<br />
Sarah noticed the flick of Petra&#39;s ears and the growing concern on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra&#39;s eyes shot wide open as she sat up, pulling her lover up with her. She jumbled together a quick and harsh whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone is coming up to the door. We gotta get outta here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah nodded and stood up grabbing her shirt along with Petra&#39;s hand and pulled her along. With her other free hand, Petra grabbed the spell book and tucked it under her arm as the two of them quickly took flight away from the door and up the wooden stairs. Sarah&#39;s clumsier steps resounded a thumping noise throughout the house as she scrambled up while Petra, already experienced in stealth, padded soundlessly up behind her. Moments later they reached the top and using the bannister to make their sharp turn, were now facing the door to Sarah&#39;s room. She pushed the ajar door open, leading the way for Petra in before she herself hopped inside. Sarah then shut it as quietly as she could, not letting it thud against the frame but still ensuring the knob nestled closed so she could click the lock in.<br />
<br />
It was all they could do. Now they just had to listen for if it was enough. <br />
<br />
Sarah pressed her head to the door to listen while Petra relied on her more acute sense of hearing behind her. For Petra it was a bit of a Deja Vu moment to leap behind a door to avoid being caught, so she hoped she&#39;d have the same luck this time as well. Sure enough seconds later the sound of the front door being opened met their ears, followed by a couple more quiet steps inside only audible to Petra. Another moment passed and then suddenly the entering party spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah? What are you doing back early? I&#39;m not the only one ditching today it looks like!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah slapped her palm to her forehead. It was her brother who somehow had also gotten the same idea to play hooky. She really should have remembered that he had a habit of quite regularly ditching his last couple classes in the day. Knowing he&#39;d eventually find her room locked, she figured it best to answer as casually as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I ought to ask you the same thing. You know what dad said last time if he&#39;d catch you skipping again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra heard him start walking across the living room. He responded as he reached the bottom of the stairs and began climbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;The key word is &#39;catch&#39;. So as far as I&#39;m concerned I&#39;m good. I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t be happy to find out you&#39;ve caught onto my habit as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah cursed under her breath and clenched her fist. He really had to turn it into a stand off. She turned to a more mediating effort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, we can both either burn for this or we both agree to keep it under wraps. I don&#39;t care what you&#39;re up to, so let&#39;s just go our separate ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point, both girls could hear him clambering up the stairs and chuckling, finding the desperation in his sister&#39;s voice quite amusing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever we both ditched for, it seems like you got something way better to hide. Maybe even so much that dad would completely forget about me having ditched. But whatever, I&#39;m feeling nice today since I&#39;ve got some fun plans. I just needed to grab something and I&#39;m out. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a way to make it up to me in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
The smugness in his voice was palpable but it relieved the girls immensely that he&#39;d just be on his way for now. They heard him walk past their door and into his. Some rummaging ensued and he was out again just as quick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and I saw your car. Hi Petra.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra&#39;s lips tightened at being drawn into the mix. Sarah turned around with aggravation toward her sibling deep set in her face and flicked her hand to get Petra to speak up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi...&quot;<br />
<br />
It was meek but it seemed to satisfy him as he just chuckled again in reply before descending the steps to the living room again. Crossing the space before exiting the door, he gave one last taunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you cats later!&quot;<br />
<br />
As he shut the door, Petra gasped out. As far as she knew, he couldn&#39;t have seen her just now. Did he potentially see her earlier at school? Petra fumbled her words baffled at how he possibly could have seen her and also caught wind of their shared plan. Sarah waved her anxiety off with an exasperated tone at her brother&#39;s jeer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s from some stupid movie he watched. He&#39;s been saying it all the damn time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra nodded and breathed the momentary tension out. At least for now, it looked like they were both in the clear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever he&#39;s up to, he&#39;ll be out for a while. He also has &#39;soccer practice&#39; to get to after.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah turned around and plopped herself down onto her bed. The room around was pretty much in line with what you&#39;d expect a tomboy girl in the suburbs to have. Bed unmade, an old beaten wooden dresser almost as old as she was, closet full of jeans and t-shirts irregularly stacked, and a desk in the corner with paper and books dashed over it. The wall across from her held a couple shelves themselves cluttered with childhood toys, framed pictures of family events, and a couple stacks of CDs. A few posters were plastered over the room as well, most of their corners curling and peeling. It was almost an antithesis to the pristine and clean state Petra kept her room in, but at least it didn&#39;t feel like an IKEA model bedroom.<br />
<br />
Glad that this little spurious hitch in their plan was smoothed out, Sarah&#39;s thoughts went back to what she had gotten so excited about earlier. Across from her also sat her bedroom mirror, it&#39;s thin but tall reflective surface enough to contain her whole sitting form and most of the bed behind her. It generally functioned as a tool to check her appearance before going out, but for exactly why it stood where it did was for more erotic reasons. She found over time that moments of self-pleasure were really enhanced by in the moment being able to see what would be an observer&#39;s view of the things she was doing to herself. In this regard she was pretty adventurous which should come at no surprise considering what she was now about to undertake. Remembering all those times initiated a pleasant tingling feeling in her chest every time she looked into it, especially now as she sat topless. The tingling grew into a hot shudder as she thought of the role it would play in what is to come.<br />
<br />
While Sarah reflected, Petra took this time to flip through the spell book to where she had found the fateful spell. Having spent a rather large amount of time studying the book prior, it didn&#39;t take her long to find the exact page of the incantation. Tracing her finger under it and mimicking its pronunciation, she knew it was the right one. She clutched the book to her chest for a moment and drummed the cover with her fingers while looking to her lover. Just envisioning those same alterations on the beautiful figure sitting before her made her own heart thump almost as excitedly as it did when she herself was transformed. Goosebumps prickled over her skin and her furred bits bristled lightly as she took the steps forward to seat herself next to Sarah. Wrapping her tail around her lover&#39;s sitting form, she rested her chin onto Sarah&#39;s shoulder and joined in watching the similarly embracing pair in the mirror. She gave a soft smile with a flashing fang protruding out over her bottom lip. Even for it being only the second time she seen her new self, it didn&#39;t jar her in the slightest. The image she carried of herself in her mind and what the mirror projected back had coalesced, all her feline features feeling completely connected and in harmony with her old body. Rubbing Sarah&#39;s back, she wanted to comfort her however she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel? I don&#39;t blame you if you&#39;re nervous. It honestly was a little bit scary at the outset, but once it starts you forget all the fear and then just enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra nuzzled her head deeper and moved her arm out and around her lover&#39;s abdomen. Sarah signed out, another nervous shudder coursing through her. She was never one to let herself get scared before jumping into something, but this leap was on an entirely different plane of adverse possibilities. Messing with things like magic carried a whole unknown world of uncertainty. What if she slips up on the incantation and something catastrophic happens as a result? Or what if it changes more than what she bargains for, specifically in her mind? That shouldn&#39;t be the case since Petra seems to be mentally and behaviorally exactly the same, minus a couple quirks like the occasional mewl and an affinity for getting pet. She shook her head and steeled her self. There was no way she would psyche herself out of an opportunity as exciting as this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel fine, really. Maybe not scared but definitely a bit nervous. Not like out of fear but just it&#39;s crazy to think that in a few minutes I&#39;ll feel things I have entirely no conception of right now. I think I know what to expect for simple things like the fangs and patches of fur, but I have no idea what it&#39;s gonna be like to have way more sensitive ears I can flick around and a long tail to avoid getting stuck in doors or sitting on by accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra giggled a bit at that last remark, knowing its truth. She half-lidded her sharp eyes in thought for a moment and stroked her fingers over Sarah&#39;s stomach. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t really know how to describe it. I wish I hadn&#39;t rushed my experience so much but I just remember that they felt really good and satisfying growing out and when they were done, everything kind of just clicked. It was like all these new muscles and bones felt as if I had them all my life and they were just invisible to me before...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah nodded and grinned. If she really focused, she could feel herself testing out light twitches in her back and little tingles atop her head making her unseen ears and tail flick about. She took a gulp and grinned widely in the thrill of uncloaking them finally. It felt right and it was on.<br />
Sarah reached over to Petra&#39;s lap and took the spell book onto her own, laying out the saved pages in front of her.<br />
<br />
The ornate beauty struck her before she even could read the text in her head. The outside of the pages was adorned by an intertwining vine of flowers and leaves drawn with extremely meticulous attention to detail, the flora almost leaping out of the page. This surrounded the main body of the text which looked to be handwritten in an especially extravagant cursive that Sarah could just barely decipher. Tucked in among it were awing sketches acting as figures to illustrate what the text described: an anatomically expanded view of the human head and its hearing organs transposed higher up the skull, a close view of a human eye except with a slitted pupil, and finally an androgynous appearing human with a few patches of fur and a long feline tail drawn transparent to show to show the interconnected vertebrae inside extending from where the spine normally ended. Sarah&#39;s mouth hung open in surprise of the beauty and life-like detail the sketches possessed. They flowed across the pages until at the bottom was a boxed phrase in deeply bolded font. That must certainly be the incantation. <br />
<br />
Sarah peered over to see the grinning Catgirl across her, drinking in her reaction of how simply such a complex process can be initiated. She moved one finger over to the bottom of the box and nodded reassuringly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to lay both your palms on the pages and read those words loudly but slowly. It starts right away so really be sure you&#39;re ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra paused to scrunch up her skirt, the hem rustling over her tail, which prompted her to remember some important advice. She patted Sarah&#39;s denim covered thigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a reason I wore this skirt with no panties besides what you may think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah got her point and laughed. Handing the book temporarily over to Petra, she stood up to get unclothed. Unbuttoning her jeans and sliding down the zipper, she pushed the waistband down off of her pelvis. Bending down to slide them off of her legs and revealing her nicely filled out panties, she remembered her helpful partner. Seeing where Petra&#39;s eyes were locked through the mirror, she giggled and gave a little superfluous wriggle of her butt to &#39;help&#39; her jeans down the rest of the way. Caught again by the flick of her eyes Petra blushed lightly with a smirk, very appreciative of the liberty taken by her lover. Shuffling from foot to foot she worked the bottom of the jeans off her feet, taking her loosened socks with them before kicking the whole affair to the corner of the room. <br />
<br />
Sarah now stood with just her undergarments and going further would break the boundary of how much she had ever let anyone see of herself. She felt a hint of trepidation but then realized there couldn&#39;t be a better time, place, and person to do it with. Reaching behind her, she clicked open the latch holding on her bra, making it immediately slacken and slip down her. Her breasts weren&#39;t the most sizable, but they definitely made up for it in their supple and perked composure with rosy pink areola. Behind her Petra bit her lip and felt her face run hot at what she was witnessing, an additional quiver also arising from under her skirt. Sarah noticed her reaction and flashed a sultry smile, turning to face the enamored Catgirl. She proceeded to teasingly finger the thin hem of her panties, eyeing up her lover with a seductive gaze and then finally starting to work them down. Bending over lightly, she made sure to make as an unabashed presentation of her bosom as possible, Petra&#39;s eyes immediately drinking in the sight. The panties fell to the floor and Sarah stepped out of them, the slight draft in the room sending chills over her nether lips. Just getting undressed for what was to come made her more wet than what she thought. Feeling that if she stood naked in front of the now audibly breathing and wide eyed Petra any longer she would get pounced, Sarah opted to instead sit down next to her and resume the book&#39;s position on her lap.<br />
<br />
Her pointer finger settled under the incantation and she took one last tense gulp. Sarah felt the words start getting pulled out of throat as if drawn by a fishing line. Her heart had spoke instead of her brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish... I was... a Catgirl...&quot;<br />
<br />
Before she could wonder what the first sensation would be, all her attention was instantly taken to the spell book in her lap. She felt an inexorable warmth begin suddenly emanating out of its pages and cover into her hands and lap, the ink of the text turning now more silver and shimmering with it&#39;s luminescence even apparent through the glare of the afternoon sun. The energy to create this effect was also now funneling its way into Sarah, filling her with a pleasant tingling all over her body that felt to be somehow simultaneously both calming and invigorating. This feeling like electricity, tantalizing her all over and making her hair stand up on end, was about to start working it&#39;s magic.<br />
<br />
From where she sat staring at the opalescent text, Sarah right away noticed more and more hair start sprouting on her forearms. It began from the base of her wrists, the fur as brown as the hair on her head filling them out all around, looking almost like a wristband before the edges began creeping further up her arm. Sarah seeing it happen gasped out laughing. It was really happening, the glee she was spilling being deeply savored by her adoring partner. Petra rubbed her lover&#39;s thigh and softly spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your fur will be so beautiful I can already tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah nodded excitedly, transfixed at the growth creeping farther and farther up, now halfway over her forearm and starting to thin out as it made the last climb to its end at her elbow. She breathed out at finally seeing its halt. Her excitement made her inadvertently tense the muscles underneath and she immediately felt and saw her fur bristle, the sensation being a hybrid between goosebumps and a gentle tickle. The desire to pull her hands away from the book and just enmesh her palms into its soft depths was immense, but the magical energy kept her hands glued tight.<br />
<br />
All the while Sarah was absorbed in her forming fur, she didn&#39;t notice a light buzzing start in her ears. It&#39;s light volume at outset was hardly discernible from the running AC, but it had just passed a boundary where it now drew her attention. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you... hear that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra pulled her attention away from her lover&#39;s new fur and crooked her head curiously, swiveling her ears and looking around. She didn&#39;t notice any new noises meet her own, at least for now, more perceptive hearing. However before she could reply, her eyes went wide and she puffed out an excited breath at a significant difference having formed in the face regarding her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, your ears! They&#39;re pointed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah blinked frantically, bewildered at not having yet felt any new sensations surrounding them. Unable to raise her hands to feel them, she looked toward the mirror and let out a muted shriek. Beyond her perplexed expression, the previously round ears that had rested on the sides of her head were no more. Their form was now much more aggressively aligned upward, the cartilage of her outer ear gradually smoothing, becoming concave, and converging to a point at the top. The position with which they sat on her head was even higher up, their changing form resting now about an inch above where they prior were. Her focus now fully on the sight of them, Sarah also noticed the pinching and pulling sensation the invisible magical hand exerted onto them as it carefully worked. They continued to climb the sides of her head, their shape at the moment a rather unflattering hybrid, but they were definitely becoming more and more akin to a cat&#39;s ear as they went. Petra sitting next to her could see from behind their form a light dusting of fur start sprouting as well beginning to fill out their soon-to-no-longer-be naked skin. Sarah was so intensely enthralled in watching their progression, she didn&#39;t notice herself start panting. Biting her lip, she was so strongly willing them on. They rounded the top of her head, her hair recessing and then growing back behind as they encroached to their final resting place atop her head. The external fur filled in the rest of the way, the boundary between her ears and the hair on her head virtually imperceivable, and as a cherry on top a gentle cloud of white puffed up inside her ears to conceal their inner organs. With a final flick, their cartilage structure snapped into place, bringing with it a loud pop in Sarah&#39;s ears. She cringed at the unpleasant sensation, but then was immediately elated to notice how in it&#39;s stead, her hearing was left so much sharper and fuller. Everything around her sounded louder, from the wind outside, to the creaking of the AC vents, and finally the breathing of Petra next to her. A throaty moan escaped alongside her pent up breath. They looked utterly adorable and just as perfect on her head as she had imagined, her immense desire to flick and swivel them overtaking her. Without anything else to go off of, Sarah simply thought about the motion of folding her ears down and proceeded to tense the top of her head. Her effort did not go nowhere as new muscles atop her head readily took their first command and caused the soft cartilage form of her new ears and fold and flatten down to her head. Sarah giggled out excitedly at how effortlessly they worked. It was not much of a stretch to alternate from one ear to the other, letting a select one stand and the other fall  before reversing their positions. Watching her lover get so enthralled in flicking and swiveling her new ears both relieved and impassioned Petra. She was glad Sarah clearly loved them and felt even more connected to her since the both of them now shared quite a useful subset of body language exclusive to their feline forms.<br />
<br />
Sarah wanted to strike a few cute poses she knew she could pull of with their ears, but before she should think of which one, a sudden burst of tightness filled the gums of her mouth. It was rather akin to some unpleasant memories from when she had braces. Submitting to that distraction she opened her mouth and was met with the sight of her incisors already having become significantly more pointed. Both the pair on top and bottom were slowly extending from her gums. The longer they became, the more the pressure in her gums subsided with them. It wasn&#39;t long before they finished, their tips sitting at about half an inch beyond the line of the rest of her teeth. Her tongue also took it upon itself to make its change here as well, it&#39;s round and plump shape getting flattened as if by some invisible rolling pin. Quickly done, it was now slightly wider and longer to where it just barely sat contained in her mouth. Bristles grew out on its top surface as well, their texture off-putting at first but upon realizing their potential in grooming and kissing, Sarah welcomed them wholeheartedly. She opened her mouth wide to fully see the changes. Thrill enveloped her, the dangerous dagger points of her fangs gleaming in their display. Flopping her tongue to the side to let it hang out and get a better view of her teeth, along with her reddened face and lidded eyes, Sarah immediately recognized the look she had on her face. It was the face she&#39;d seen a couple times on certain web pages of a particular persuasion she may or may have not intended to end up on. The pure embrace of animalistic lust and passion seen on kind like herself while mating was splayed across her visage. She shuddered at recognizing how immaculate her inadvertent rendition of it was, but smirked hungrily knowing it would become very commonplace on her. Petra must have caught it as well as she suddenly produced a softly strained mewl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah... You&#39;re melting me... I&#39;m almost about to burst at how hot you looked right there. I don&#39;t mean to rush the rest of the spell, but I am dying for you right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra pawed her bosom, feeling how hot and sensitive she was, her nipples firing off electrical discharges into her body as she glanced over them. This whole time she had been getting insanely wet underneath her skirt, desperately trying to resist ravaging herself for the sake of not diverting Sarah&#39;s focus on her transformation. <br />
<br />
The heat developing in Sarah&#39;s body spiked suddenly, Petra even noticing how hot the skin of her lover&#39;s thigh touching her own had instantaneously become. The magical process gave little pause as light pricks of growing fur began slowly emerging out of Sarah&#39;s thighs starting just a couple inches short of her pelvis. The sight and feeling of another patch of fur growing on her body delighted Sarah immensely. It&#39;s covering was thin where it started, but as it grew further up her thighs and encroached on her groin, it became significantly thicker. Thankfully at having stripped naked beforehand, Sarah was able to see its full development around her nether region. As the fur reached her vulva, the bushy pubic hair she had prior rapidly dissipated, its tangled length seeming to smooth and be enveloped in an even coating that served to conceal her sex. However with being as aroused as she was, the accumulated nectar she expelled now dampened this new patch of fur, quite clearly outlining her entrance and betraying any effort her natural coat made at modesty. It didn&#39;t end there though. The growth continued, rounding over the top of her thighs and filling the area in between them like a skimpy pair of panties. Craning her neck to see her side and behind, Sarah watched it further propagate around her hips and from underneath her buttocks. It appeared as if the independently growing fronts were about to meet at the small of her back, essentially forming a permanent pair of underwear on her, as minimal as it was. Seeing it complete, Sarah&#39;s face flushed with heat at how sexy the design of her fur was, along with realizing panties were now an obsolete necessity for her new body. If the book hadn&#39;t immobilized her hands, she would have jumped at pleasuring herself to no end amidst this new luxurious blanket on her body. Petra&#39;s lust was no lesser, the thought of lapping up her lover&#39;s lay nectar from her furred nethers sitting firmly at the forefront of her mind. <br />
<br />
It was all going so well and Sarah could hardly contain her excitement. Her whole body was insanely hot all over and continually trembled in her desperate desire to feel, touch, and embrace its new form. The moment where the magic yielded its bind and Sarah could release her bound joy and sexual hunger was so severely tempting, she had forgotten about the one thing that truly was the best part. <br />
<br />
A strong twinge erupted in Sarah&#39;s tailbone, the shock of its feeling making her deeply arch her back and let loose a throaty moan. Like a vacuum, its area of effect felt to have sucked the lay heat from all the rest of her body, minus her face and nether region, to its site for what now needed to happen. It didn&#39;t take long for Sarah to realize what it signified, the corners her agape mouth loosely coming up into a ravenous grin. A twitching feeling initiated the process, the vestigial stump of her spine once again after millennia coming to life and making it&#39;s presence known as a small jutting nub working its way out of her back just above her buttocks. The slight motion it made was enough to catch the sharp eyes of Petra who laughed out ecstatically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah! Your tail! It&#39;s coming out! Here let me help you turn since you definitely want to see this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah nodded furiously, not wanting to miss a second of seeing her new appendage grow in. Petra grabbed the spell book with her lover&#39;s attached hands and moved it off her lap and further to the side of the bed. To accommodate, Sarah turned her body and slid her knees up onto her bed so she laid prostrate with her rear raised up to the mirror. With an oddly more flexible back, she curled her torso around and was met with the reflected sight of her voluptuously presented backside with a dripping wet sex and additionally, a teasingly short stub of her new tail. <br />
<br />
Heat shot across Sarah&#39;s groin at the vulnerable position she was presenting herself in. One thing was to be so unabashedly poised for mating, but on top of that to be showcasing her soon-to-be illustrious tail so proudly made her shudder in thrill. How tragic it was that growing her tail was an experience she could have only once. But the more she sat in tense heat, the more an irritating itch was starting to build right at her tailbone. Sarah gulped and hissed out a strained breath at the forming discomfort, some degree of pain audibly present in it. Her loyal partner at her side felt the tension and squirming in her body as Sarah struggled to hold her composure and was compelled to comfort and help her along. Scooting up next to her lover&#39;s raised rear, she rubbed her much cooler palm atop the scaldingly hot skin of the small of Sarah&#39;s back and cooed some comforting words for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know how hot and intense it feels but it really helps if you just relax the best you can. Take a deep breath and close your eyes for a second. Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah nodded jerkily but followed her lover&#39;s advice and proceeded to inhale deeply through her nose before letting herself slowly exhale the hot air out of her mouth. Closing her eyes and letting her tense shoulders droop, a chain reaction began that loosened the muscles all the way down her back until reaching those that were inhibiting her tail&#39;s growth. It felt as if something had fallen out of her, shaking Sarah out of her ephemeral rest. Her tail had instantly extended a few inches, its hairless form hanging down over her rosebud and vulva. No pause was taken as it&#39;s length kept steadily growing, the combination of Petra&#39;s elated expression and the relaxing massaging of her back acting as a catalyst for its formation. Sarah moaned once again and licked her lips at the unbelievably provocative sight. Jutting her rear out more aggressively and groaning like the animal she was becoming felt to even more urge her tail&#39;s growth on. At this point its still naked form hung down to the middle of her thighs, but Sarah couldn&#39;t hold back her desire to experience this new part of her. Unfortunately the nerves for its motor control hadn&#39;t developed yet making her unable to flick it about, so she had to resort to wriggling her rear to bring motion to it instead. Suddenly new sensations vigorously ran up her back. Somehow she was feeling the smooth skin of her thighs and ticklish fur of her groin, but as if by something further from her body. It felt very off putting at first, but by being able to correlate those new feelings to what she was seeing her tail actually do through her mirror made her fully adopt the presence of sense it brought. Sarah laughed out excitedly at feeling that fledgling connection.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I feel it! I can&#39;t believe it but wow I can really feel it! Please, please, please keep going. Petra... I don&#39;t know if I can do it. It&#39;s too good and I feel so hot that I don&#39;t think I can relax enough to keep going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra knew what to do, and with a confident smile administered her aid like a medical professional. With her other hand, she cupped the growing end of Sarah&#39;s growing tail and held it further out from her body with just a tad of pulling tension. It was precisely what Sarah needed. She gasped out in the much more visceral feeling she received by Petra handing her tail like this, her body both squeezing out more of her tail and more nectar from her nether lips. Her new appendage was now at least a foot and a half long, and much to Sarah&#39;s joy was starting to become coated in fur from it&#39;s base. This growth on its surface sped up shockingly quick, proceeding down it&#39;s length faster than what the flesh was extending at and making it seem that the two processes will indeed coalesce at their ends. In her fur&#39;s progress, it&#39;s bristling hairs tickled over Sarah&#39;s exposed rosebud and sex, causing her body to shudder in a brief convulsion. This whole experience was leaving her so aroused she felt that if she could slip one finger in, she would burst right away. That thought didn&#39;t stay long as at that moment Petra decided to take some initiative.<br />
<br />
While Sarah was hypnotized by her new tail, her lover slyly slipped the hand that formerly was rubbing her back down just a couple inches to where it found the furred base of her tail resting. Seeing it as an opportune moment for revenge on what Sarah did to her earlier, Petra deviously licked her lips and squeezed down on that lump of flesh. The owner of that vulnerable zone didn&#39;t expect the resulting explosion of sensation.<br />
<br />
Fireworks blew up in her brain, the freshly laid new pathways of nerves flaring up red hot by what this new erogenous zone provided her. Sarah bucked her hips and moaned out gutturally, but Petra maintained her grip. Unknown to her until that moment, the base of such a sensitive appendage was very conveniently placed for a dominant partner to pacify his or her mate. That effect was certainly clear, as in the ebbing flow of that crashing wave Sarah slumped down even deeper into her bed, nuzzling her head further into her covers, arching her back to a seemingly inhuman magnitude, and letting her legs slide even further apart to present more of her glistening sex. Concurrently, this action did nothing to halt the growth, even actually the opposite as Sarah&#39;s melted state allowed the appendage to stretch comfortably out another several inches. It was nearing just about a meter in length with the trailing growth of fur almost fully caught up to the rounded naked tip. To Petra, it was an immaculate and insanely gratifying sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s beautiful Sarah. It feels so soft and looks even longer than mine. I just want to bury my face in it and wrap it all around my body. Look! I think it&#39;s almost done!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah blinked away the haze of sensory overload and cleared up her sight to her new gorgeous tail nearly at completion. Petra&#39;s feelings were hardly her own as Sarah felt so strongly compelled to act the same way toward it. Seeing it&#39;s impressive length and luscious sheen in the mirror awoke in her a deeply carnal pride toward it, the way it framed her backside and how closely it was linked to her intimate zones making Sarah virtually glow in her exhibition. Watching the last few inches of fur fill in the vacant space at its tip made her hold her breath in anticipation of its dramatic conclusion. With the last hair having grown in at its very end, the finale certainly lived up to expectations.<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s back jerked and contorted as if struck by lightning, making her shut her eyes and wince in the vigor of the sensation. It was a bit of departure from the pleasant experience until then, but as she relaxed, a new neural tendril made itself quite apparent to her. Opening her eyes to regard her finished tail, it didn&#39;t look and feel to be some secondary addition that came as a blank slate to her cognition. On the contrary, her new appendage felt as familiar to her as that of her arms, all the pathways of nerves down through the fresh new muscles ready to act on her total volition. Petra had not been exaggerating about how it would simply click into her. <br />
<br />
Sarah could hardly contain herself, her body tensing up to burst off her bed and experience every new facet of her feline body. Before she could however, she found her hands were still bound to the book with its energy still flowing into her. To her that didn&#39;t make sense. Wasn&#39;t her tail the last alteration the magic had to make? Before she could panic at anything having gone wrong, another development took her attention.<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s vision suddenly blurred, an unpleasant soreness also arising as if from inside her very eyeballs. Shutting her eyes to try to alleviate it, her irritation at the feeling made apparent by a light whimper, was hardly the manner Petra expected her lover to be in at the conclusion of her transformation. Horrified that something had gone wrong, she removed her stead at Sarah&#39;s backside and moved over right in front of her face. Embracing her cheeks with her hands, she worriedly consoled her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong? What hurts? Is it the magic or something in your body?&quot;<br />
<br />
The frenzied assault of questions wasn&#39;t answered by Sarah. Her focus was instead drawn to the twitching that felt to be in the center of her eyes, growing in magnitude with each tick until it felt to be becoming unbearable. Sarah cringed expecting another throb of the pain but instead felt nothing, the pain suddenly departing and leaving no trace of itself behind in the slightest. She decided to open her eyes finally. <br />
<br />
At the first instant, she saw the very anxious demeanor of her lover inches from her own face extremely expectant of some kind of clarification to what had pained her as such. Before Sarah could reconstruct the brief experience, the worry melded away completely in Petra&#39;s face and she proceeded to sit back on her haunches with relief washed over her face. Sarah was very perplexed with what made her lover dismiss her concern so instantly. Some hint presented itself to her when she also felt her hands detach from the spell book as if a pair of pressure activated suction cups had been disengaged. With that, the faint background tingling in her body was sucked out alongside it, the magic having fully dissipated with its work being done.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think taking a look in the mirror will clear things up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah raised a curious eyebrow, but took Petra&#39;s advice. Looking back at her reflected self with nothing seeming awry, her eyebrows furrowed in wonder. It didn&#39;t help that with her new body her feline eyes hardly looked out of place, but finally Sarah had noticed. The changed elements widened, fully exposing to Sarah their new appearance. Slitted sharp pupils were now instead taking the sight in for her and encapsulating them was her iris which maintained its overall brown hue, but had become far brighter and more saturated. Sarah blinked a few times as if to settle a new pair of contacts but found no such feeling of obstruction on her eyes. As silly as that suspicion was, it prompted her to really notice the improvement to her sense of sight that came with them.<br />
<br />
Glancing around her room, Sarah was bewildered at how clear and crisp everything looked with all corners and boundaries of objects appearing as sharp as knives to her sensitive new eyes. It was almost too much to process, every bit of chipped paint of her wall and dents on her desk and drawer completely clear and defined. Maybe it really was time to fix things up in her room. But that was a focus for far more in the future. Right now, she had finally become a Catgirl and was ecstatic to bask in the pleasures it brought.<br />
<br />
Powerful feline energy boiled up in her body, making Sarah burst off the bed to her feet. Spreading her arms and looking herself all over felt like having opened a present on Christmas morning. She had her suspicions during the transformation, but her body beyond its feline features had also received some sensual improvements. Looking down at her bosom it certainly looked more pronounced and firm, a combination of the generous endowment of a model and the rigorous refinement of an athlete. Looking over her shoulder to assess her behind, she found her rear was not much less lucky with having become significantly more shapely and taut. This pleasant surprise was quickly attested by the animating of that special feature Sarah had longed to have the most since seeing it on Petra.<br />
<br />
Sarah in her excited state had prompted her tail to start flicking and swaying behind her, energized to life by it&#39;s role as a conduit to her emotions. Having started on its own, it didn&#39;t take much for Sarah to will its action on further of her own accord. With increased consciousness of her tail&#39;s muscles, all it took was for her to just squeeze those newly familiar zones with a tad bit more pressure to put its whole length into an intense arc of wagging. It was like magic to her eyes witnessing the power and grace in her new appendage. She closed her eyes and let herself be enveloped by the sensations wagging her tail brought. The symphony of the vast number of muscles from her back to down its length extending and contracting in perfect synconization together to produce the movement she desired was of pure tantalizing awe to her. For Sarah this whole ordeal was a surreal pleasure and a deep satisfaction to experience, and the more she stood there enjoying her tail&#39;s motion, the more she felt it connect to her. It was no longer was her body and a tail, but rather just her body. She even flicked and swiveled her ears as she learned before to make sure they weren&#39;t left out. The meditative state this all induced to Sarah was not only blissful but almost awakening. Simply submitting herself to a state of deep awareness to everything in her body felt to make herself more in tune with the world around her. Maybe it was simply her new more sensitive and perceptive nature, but somehow Sarah felt like all the puzzle pieces of her part in the world had found their place and settled comfortably. Before she could philosophize any deeper, she something felt catch and hold her tail in its grasp.<br />
<br />
This whole while Petra had gotten a bit impatient and decided to get her lover&#39;s attention in the most convenient way available to her. So when Sarah turned around to see what was impeding her tail, she was met by the playful smile of the restive cat responsible with the tip of the hostage appendage in her grasp. Seeing there was no possible escape with her most glaring vulnerability fully seized, Sarah surrendered and let her tail fall slack. Petra giggled and crooked her head to the side very curious how her lover was finding her new feline form. Her own tail was visible behind her shoulders as it swished back and forth in a slow and seductive manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well? How is it? It looks like you certainly are having fun though. Just don&#39;t forget about old me over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra flicked her fingers over the tip of Sarah&#39;s tail as if to elicit a response out from her. It certainly did the trick as her tail&#39;s tip was just as erogenous as its base, the twiddling of fingers on its surface  enough to make its owner shudder from the procured electric zaps of delight running up her back. However, it was quite a bit more motivation than what Petra bargained for as she found herself getting pounced by the incensed cat she had tempted too recklessly.<br />
<br />
For Sarah that little stimulation was enough to rekindle the massive amount of arousal she&#39;d built up while transforming. The way Petra sat so wantonly provoking her also didn&#39;t help hold her back much either. Now that she was the same &#39;species&#39; as her lover, there were now some new sexual triggers that came with their parallel anatomies. A handful were rooted in the body language of their shared feline features, the example at hand being tail flirting, but more triggers were based in senses other than touch and sight. Another one that became very apparent, thanks to their acute sense of smell, was each other&#39;s scents. Amidst their rolling and tumbling, the lay nectar the both of them had expelled over the past events suddenly became aerated, filling the air around them with the thick miasma of their sex. It charged up the wrestling cats even more, the room getting filled with the noise of panting breaths, creaking of the wooden bed frame, and strained groans. They were lucky the whole that no one was home or even walking past the front of the house.<br />
<br />
Size was a slight advantage in Sarah&#39;s corner, so eventually she had her lover firmly pinned underneath her. Resting her knees between Petra&#39;s legs and holding her shoulders down with her hands did not leave her captive much of any avenue of escape. Try as she could to grab Sarah&#39;s forearms and pull them off, Petra knew she was beat. With the hungry feline lover looking down at her like a delicious snack, the only card she had left to play was the tail she had miraculously managed to keep a hold of during their match. In the moment unsure if it would work, she had to try since it was the only potential way out. Petra pouted her lips and blew a gentle stream of air out and onto the fur of the tip of her captor&#39;s tail. <br />
<br />
It worked like a charm. The tip of her tail bristled and the most intense tickling sensation Sarah had ever felt vigorously coursed up her spine. With a high pitch yelp followed by uncontrollable giggling, her muscles and composure utterly slacked as she fell right onto her lover&#39;s chest. Her voice muffled by Petra&#39;s bosom and heavily hindered by the intense laughing fit, she barely got her surrender out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I yield, I yield! That&#39;s so not fair! You&#39;re just lucky I didn&#39;t focus on getting yours and instead had some integrity in my technique.&quot;<br />
<br />
Petra took the offered white flag and freed her grasp on Sarah&#39;s tail. She shifted her hand now to lightly scratching at her lover&#39;s scalp with the intent to hopefully relax her instead. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just like chess. I could have checkmates you the whole time but I let you have your fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah folded her ears down to let Petra scratch more thoroughly, the gentle stroking sending soothing waves of calm through her worked up body. Her voice took on a much drowsier tone as the treatment was working to its desired effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now that I know what game we&#39;re playing I&#39;ll adjust my approach then. Don&#39;t expect to get me as easily next time.&quot;<br />
<br />
As hot as the fire of passion was burning in Sarah&#39;s chest, the gentle ear scratching had her pacified like a kitten grabbed by the scruff of its neck. It turned out that opportune knowledge had far beat out raw power in the fight for dominance among the two catgirls. Not that this hierarchy was set in stone forever, but it would stick at least for this exchange of theirs.<br />
<br />
Although Sarah had been the aggressor, it didn&#39;t mean that Petra herself wasn&#39;t charged up with lust from the combination of groping her lover&#39;s naked body and breathing in her natural aphrodisiac while wrestling with her. She wanted just as badly for things to get to the next level so she could get the release the whole afternoon had been dangling in front of her so temptingly. Taking this moment of peace to think, she had to decide what the best approach would be for their consummation before things got rolling too quickly.<br />
<br />
Staying in Sarah&#39;s bedroom would be the most convenient option, but it did lend itself to potential interruptions and didn&#39;t quite feel to be the &#39;natural&#39; place for them to mate. Combing her mind for what would feel &#39;natural&#39; led her to peer out the bedroom window. Out past the rooftops of the neighbors and their attached yards, far further in the distance was her answer. The bristling leaves of trees and overgrown brush of their local forest preserve turned park was her answer. It felt to almost be calling out to her for the couple to take their shared deed into its remote depths. As strong as the call of the wild was, it did mean halting their fun for now and taking the time to make their way over, a decision not as easy to make with the naked body of her lover resting atop her. Petra had to be the one to decide.</p>
