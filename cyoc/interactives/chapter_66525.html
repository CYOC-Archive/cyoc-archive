<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&lt; (Shortly after the events of Jennifer Smith's Halloween party)<br />
<br />
Tony just realized something horrible as he woke up from a nighttime slumber. His friend Kyle had really tried <br />
to turn him into a bug. No, seriously. He meant it, and he would have done it had Tony not applied a mental <br />
block against his(now Kylie's) powers. This hurt Tony deeply, almost traumatized him. How could someone good <br />
like Kyle, a friend since middle school, turn to the dark side so forcefully like that? How long had he known <br />
about the town curse? How long had he been planning on terrorizing the school populace? It was only a matter <br />
of time until Kylie became aware of her power, and hope permitting, she wouldn't use it for evil. But just in <br />
case, Tony needed to be prepared. Like the Boy Scouts.<br />
<br />
<br />
One frosty November morning, Tony told his parents that he was going out for a while to hang with friends. <br />
While this actually was a normal thing for him to do on his time off from school, as the new Sorcerer Supreme, <br />
Tony had the burden of making time to plan against many supernatural threats. So far there weren't away except <br />
for Kylie, but the realization last night had shaken him. So he decided to go shopping.<br />
<br />
*Three Hours Later*<br />
<br />
Tony returned home, and to prevent his folks from knowing what was going on, cast a spell of obliviousness so <br />
they wouldn't see the stuff he was bringing in. Don't worry, the spell only last an hour. When he was in his <br />
room, the teen titan(if you will allow such a shameless reference) dropped the cardboard box onto his bed, and <br />
began to unload.<br />
<br />
Tony's shopping trip had acquired him the magical bowls and food to offer a favor to Circe, the minor immortal <br />
enchantress from Homer's Odyssey. Tony wanted to talk to her about what to do about Kylie, and given Circe's <br />
own powers over transformation, he figured that he couldn't do much better than going to her. Of course, she <br />
didn't live on this plane anymore. She ascended into a nice country house in an alternate dimension centuries <br />
ago.<br />
<br />
The circle in which Tony had offered the bowl of meat and herbs suddenly glowed, and he was then transported <br />
into the realm of the gods(or one of them, at least).<br />
<br />
The country home of Circe was of course not a real home, but the closest approximation our human minds can <br />
handle. Tony walked through the grass that wasn't really grass, and knocked on the wooden door that wasn't <br />
really a wooden door, and waited.<br />
<br />
The door opened. Circe was as beautiful as you might expect, though it seemed that Tony had caught her as if <br />
she had just gotten out of the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eye of Agamotto? Cloak of Levitation? Ah, so you're the new Sorcerer Supreme. Come on in to my humble abode!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony stepped inside the house to find that it was well furnished, with a vast kitchen and a nice sitting room <br />
where a library filled with all the ancient classics stood idly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like something to drink per chance?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony laughed. &quot;No, I'm not falling for that old chestnut, Circe. As you know, I summoned you to ask for a <br />
favor. I prepared the traditional sacrifice for you in the way that it was foretold in the Ancient One's* <br />
texts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. What do you need?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony began to explain the situation in Glendale to the minor goddess, about the curse and the ancient magic <br />
that was behind it. How his ex-friend Kyle Perkins had gone mad with his need for vengeance and tried to use <br />
the curse to hurt everyone at school, and how his mind got trapped inside the body of his distaff counterpart, <br />
Kylie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mortal, I've seen this before. Almost the same exact situation. Ever hear of Zatanna Zatara?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The comic book character?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, or so you think. She was originally a mad sorcerer in New York City in the 1930's named John Zatara. He <br />
was going on about warping the Earth in his own image too, until he was defeated by your old namesake, the <br />
former Sorcerer Supreme. Zatara was banished to the world of fiction, only living in the mind's of <br />
storytellers and readers, and since some sorcerers are able to revive themselves via the recollection by <br />
others of their own image, the Ancient One* changed his gender, and made her the good female magic user that <br />
we now know as Zatanna.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony thought about this. &quot;Hmm...Kyle might actually make a good villain. I wonder what I could put him in...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're saying&quot;, started Tony, &quot;that I can't fix Kylie at all then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she'll always be unstable in my opinion. The only way to prevent the evil side of her personality from <br />
taking over is to sever it completely from her. Split her personality in two, where she is Kylie and Kyle is <br />
Kyle. The masculine side and the feminine side of Kylie's soul must be separated for it to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you can't do that!&quot; shouted Tony. &quot;They're inherently linked to each other. Kylie's personality only <br />
exists because I put a mental wipe on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As of the present time, Kylie has a fresh set of memories and a brand new soul. But as she gets older, <br />
develops some fresh relationships, becomes a new person, her need to remain in this reality will strengthen. <br />
If you give it time to ferment, her essence, her very soul, will become unique enough from Kyle's that it <br />
wouldn't have the same motivations of her former self.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me write this down. So one, how do you transfer Kyle's soul into the realm of fiction?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the Sorcerer Supreme, you figure it out. I've fully digested your offering now, and delicious as it <br />
was, I owe you no more favors. Please leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony sighed at this command, and left. He appeared back in his room, at a loss and waiting out for the moment <br />
Kylie turned evil sorceress again.<br />
<br />
<br />
* The previous Sorcerer Supreme &gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
(Back to the present day)<br />
<br />
Doctor Mage left his physical body on the ninth plane, and took on his astral form. He floated down slowly to <br />
our dimension, and then to Earth, and then to Glendale, and finally to Kylie Perkins' home. He phased through <br />
the second story window, and found through process of elimination that Kylie was the one with the locked door.<br />
<br />
As Tony's astral form watched Kylie moan in her sleep, he called out to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her own astral form floated out of her body. She looked scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you're that superhero on the news. You and Wonder Gal are the world's first real life ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am, Kylie. I sensed that you were afraid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; she said, finally breaking down into tears. &quot;This boy keeps insisting that I'm really him, and that...I <br />
need to hurt people. (Sob). He tells me about these powers that I have over transformation, and that <br />
I...I...should do these things. These really perverted things. I feel like I'm cracking up! Am I insane? What <br />
do I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie, I can help you overcome him. I will tell you the story of how all of this happened to you later, but <br />
you need to stay strong and help me in return. I'll return shortly to separate you from him, psychically <br />
removing him from your mind forever. In the meantime, DO NOT let him influence you whatsoever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mage then left the Perkin's house to retrieve his body. He was sure that Laura was mentally strong enough to <br />
avoid whatever was happening to her. In Tony's mind, he believed that if he get's rid of Kyle first, then this <br />
new science villain will be much easier to deal with.<br />
<br />
