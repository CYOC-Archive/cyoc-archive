<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chilled by the notion he might be stuck as a supernatural being, Lorkin tried to take to the air. Wanting to get back to the well, as wells as his clothes, where he hoped he could find a solution, he was disappointed he was incapable of flight. Wings working fine, he was unable to elevate himself, and trying to make himself do so only made him even more aware of an issue he hadn’t taken into consideration, not in his stories or in actually becoming a fairy.<br />
<br />
It had never occurred to him as he wrote his stories about fairies, drew pictures of them, even fantasised about being one, how much energy they must consume. Not sure if being the size he now was contributed to the way he felt drained, how hungry he was, Lorkin chastised himself on how it made sense using his wings to move about would have such an effect on him. Reaching up to pluck a couple leaves, which he then placed on the tree branch, he sat down on them, thinking of hummingbirds. Remembering something he’d read about the way they beat their wings might have something to do with their increased intake, he scanned the surrounding area as he wondered how he might deal with this new problem.<br />
<br />
From his perch, he could see almost all of the wooded area which encircled the well, the hill the thing sat atop, and after a moment, his mind still on birds, he peered at the flowers scattered about. An idea coming to him, Lorkin wondered for a minute how he was to get down before standing and walking back along the tree’s limb. Approaching the trunk, it didn’t take him long before he figured out climbing down at his size wasn’t an issue, and the way his fingernails now were pointed helped him create handholds when there was nothing for him grab hold of.<br />
<br />
On the ground, he crouched low. Feeling wary of the long grass and what might be hidden in it, he inched his way forward. Examining the flowers each time he came upon them, watching the insects like butterflies and bees as he did so, it didn’t take him long before he found what he was looking for. Hoping he wasn’t going to make himself sick, he sampled the nectar, and finding it was sweet, and revitalised him, he began to slurp it up as fast he could. Trying pollen a couple times, he found it also had the same effect, but was awfully bitter, leaving him with the decision to eat it only as a last-ditch option. Feeling as if he had a better understanding of one of his body’s needs, he even sampled some wild berries when he saw several birds making a go at them.<br />
<br />
With his stomach full, and his energy seeing back to what he saw as normal for his current form, Lorkin took to the air. Keeping a constant look out for anything threatening, he scanned the area. Not sure where he was at the moment, it took him some time before he could find his way back to the well. Landing on the rim of it, he peered down into it, and still not able to make out the bottom, finding if anything, it looked even deeper, he wandered over to the edge overlooking the hill. Returning to the problem he’d been trying to come up with a solution to, he looked down, didn’t see his clothes, and thought, “Probably on the wrong side of the well.”<br />
<br />
But then he saw the stone steps, which confirmed he was on the correct side. Upset by the disappearance of his stuff, he took to the air and for a moment, zipped about, searching the area, until, with a heavy sigh, he landed on the ground. Wondering what happened to his clothes, thinking the only thing which made sense was somebody, “Possibly a park ranger or game warden,” he reasoned, had come along and collected the things. Wondering what he was to do now, he returned to the stone steps and stood at the top of them. Going back over everything, feeling more certain the answer to his problem was to make another wish, he saw the biggest issue now was he had no money, as it had all been in the pocket of his jeans, which he hadn’t been able to get to. Finding himself further upset, he glanced down at his naked female form and huffed, “Why couldn’t my clothes shrink down as well when I transformed,” and having no answer to this, he again took to the air.<br />
<br />
How long he spent flitting about, trying to come up with another solution, Lorkin didn’t know. Stopping every so often to sample the nectar in the flowers, eat whatever wild berries he could find, and, when desperate enough, ingest pollen, he soon made his way back to the well. Knowing the one thing he didn’t want to lose sight of was the well, as he was certain it held the answer to him not being a fairy, he also understood, at some point, he would have to go in search of his clothes or a coin to drop in it. <br />
<br />
Not sure if he could find his way back if he went further than he’d already gone, he landed next to the well. Gazing at the old stones it had been constructed with, furrowing his brow in concentration, Lorkin glanced up after some time, and was started to see how the sky had deepened and the afternoon had almost passed. Guessing the time had to be around six or so, he wondered what his family would say when he didn’t come home as he absently fiddled with the ring. Looking down at the thing, torn between liking it and hating it, he wanted to blame it for everything which had happened to him, but, at the same time, knew such behaviour served no function. Glancing at the well, then around at the surrounding area, it came to him, if he were to remain where he was, he was going to need to find a place to sleep for the night. Worrying his lip as he considered what sort of predators might be active at night, he again started to fiddle with the ring. Looking down at his hand after some time, an idea slowly starting to form as he recalled the last time he took the piece of jewellery off, Lorkin flapped his wings, and took to the air.<br />
<br />
His movement swift, he headed for the nearest trees, where he gathered two leaves. Flitting low to the ground, he searched about for a minute or so before finding some moss, and collecting it, he headed back to the well. Landing next to it, he placed the stuff he’d gotten on the ground, squatted down, and proceeded to dig a hole in the ground. When it was deep enough for him to put his whole hand and part of his lower arm in it, he took off the ring. Packing it in the moss, then rolling it up in the leaves, he hoped he wasn’t making a mistake as he pressed it against some of the stones the wall had been built from, then filled back in the hole.<br />
<br />
Finished, he peered at the spot for a moment before turning. Walking over to the steps, he turned back to look at the well and the area where he buried the ring. Taking to the air, he zipped and swooped about until he was sure he was at a good enough distance away. Hovering in midair, he focused his thoughts on the ring, and after a bit, he turned and following the same sensation of being drawn, he headed back to and around the well. Feeling this confirmed he’d be able to find the well again, Lorkin took a final look about before he pushed himself up as high as he could and getting his bearings, headed in what he hoped was the direction of town.<br />
<br />
A few feet below him, the tops of the trees passed, and after some time, he had to go down amongst them to find something replenish the energy he was expending. The rest of the day slipping by, it was full dark by the time he reached the edge of the park. Landing on the wall surrounding it, taking a breather, he peered out at the city. Listening to the night sounds of car horns, sirens, people, animals like rats going about their business, Lorkin grimaced at how slow, low, and painful a lot of the noises where, as well as shivered as he saw how big everything now was. Tempted to turn around, he instead reminded himself, “You need a coin for the well,” as he took to the air, went as high as he could, and headed away from the park.<br />
<br />
When he was a few blocks away, he landed atop a light pole to take a breather. Hunching low to in an effort to make himself less visible, enjoying the heat coming off the lamp, he cursed himself for failing to consider he was going to need food, as well as how finding flowers outside the park would be much more difficult. Turning his thoughts to the ring, it took him a moment before he reorientated himself to the direction he’d need to go, and was confused why it wasn’t back the way he’d come.<br />
<br />
“Does the park move?” he asked himself as he considered it might make sense and why he’d wandered into a place he’d swear he’d never seen before.<br />
<br />
“Suppose it doesn’t really matter,” he decided after some time. “So long as I can find my way back,” and taking to the air, he followed the road below him for a bit before slowing when he smelled something familiar.<br />
<br />
Rich, sweet, and heady, it didn’t take Lorkin long before he located a floral shop. Careful in his movements, making sure the way was clear, he soon dropped down around back. Searching about, trying to find a way in, he soon spotted an open window. Approaching it, wary, wanting to make sure he wasn’t seen, he entered it and zipped up toward a light fixture. Taking a quick look about, seeing nobody, but hearing voices nearby, which he assumed where coming from the front, he waited a bit before he dropped down to a table where a bunch of flowers had been arranged in various pots. Setting to work to fortify himself, alert and on guard for the first hint of trouble, he busied himself drinking nectar and, despite dislike it, eating pollen, all as he felt scared a human might discover him.<br />
<br />
No longer thinking of himself as human, it came as surprise to Lorkin when he realised this. Taking off after some time, he exited the building the same way he’d come in. As he did, he thought over what he’d come to understood, and after a bit, believed it made sense. This in turn led him to wonder, “If I’ve stopped considering himself human, will I eventually cease to think of myself as Lorkin, only seeing myself as Taline? As well as the way I see myself still as male, despite the fact I clearly female? Will I eventually start to think of myself as a female fairy instead of a teenage boy who just so happens to look like a young woman with wings?” and not having any way to answer, he landed atop another lamp post and gazed out at the city.<br />
<br />
Night having come full on, Lorkin found it even harder to see everything, with the only thing really aiding him were the street lights. Warming himself from the heat coming off the light, his thoughts returned to how he’d have to find a place to sleep for the night and continue his search in the morning. Thinking over how he might have to resort to entering a store and raiding the till, he found he didn’t like such an option, but couldn’t see any other way to get a coin for the well. Taking to the air after some time, he muttered, “I’ll figure it out in the morning. Right now, I want to find someplace to rest,” and picking a direction, he slowed after some time when he caught sight of window display.<br />
<br />
Unable to read the name of store, as the words, besides being too big, for reasons he didn’t understand were all jumbled up, Lorkin landing above the store’s main entrance. Hoping what he saw in the window was an accurate indication of what the store sold, he waited until the door opened. Not paying attention if anyone was going in or out, he dropped down, worked his wings as fast as he could, and zipped inside. Moving as quick as he could to get out of sight, he landed on a fake planet which was part of a display of a solar system. Crouching low, he listened for a moment to determine if he’d been seen. When it was clear he hadn’t, he eased himself up a little and peeked around what he was now certain was a toy store. Taking in as much as he could, he soon spotted an area which might prove promising.<br />
<br />
Displeased with what he might have to do, Lorkin waited a moment to make sure the coast was clear before taking to the air. Making a large, circular flight pattern, stopping to hide every so often, he eventually alighted on a top shelf and looked at the dollhouse someone had set up there, as well as the other items. Heading for the doll clothes, he took a moment to go slowly through them before he found an open-backed dress which fit him. Adjusting the Velcro on the straps going up and coming together at the base of his neck, then the way his breasts were cupped, he ran a ran down the front before turning his attention to the doll house.<br />
<br />
Larger than what he’d expected, the immediate issue he saw was how to get in. Flapping his wings, Lorkin flitted over to it. Examining the exterior, he landed when he discovered what he thought was a seam. Examining it, seeing nothing keeping it closed, he worked his tiny fingers into it and within moments, the front was open wide enough for him to slip inside. The piece he’d worked open slapping shut the moment he was inside, Lorkin jumped upon hearing it and taking a moment to calm himself, he then peered about.<br />
<br />
Things clearly intended for a doll five to six inches bigger than his current height, he took to wandering. Seeing how the dollhouse had been stocked with toy furniture carved with such intricate detail, making it look as realistic as possible, he sat in a couple of the chairs, lay on the one of the couches, and after a bit, headed upstairs. Peeking into the bedrooms, finding they were all stocked, he soon settled on a room with a bed so soft, it was comfy. Yawning, wings pressed flat again his back, he stretched out on it. Hoping nothing would disturb him, he turned over to lie on his side. Finding it felt more comfortable to lay so, he shifted in place, finding as he did, it felt odd to have his chest pushed outward, pressing against the top part of the dress he was wearing and his arm, as well as to feel the bottom part of the garment pressed against his now flat groin, he sighed after a moment. Trying to not let how strange it felt to sleeping in a female doll’s piece of clothing, or how he now had a woman’s body, he shifted in place a bit more before he started to feel at ease. Closing his eyes, trying to ignore how peculiar everything now was, he instead though about what he’d have to do tomorrow.</p>
