<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Now then,” Nat continued after a dramatic pause, “the reason that you and Jessica are so valuable is because you are some of the only individuals that have ever managed to escape the Zoo unharmed. There have been a handful of others, but they all seem to go missing or disappear without a trace before anyone gets a chance to reach out to them. But now that you and Jessica are here, I believe we can use you to further undermine the Zoo’s power.”<br />
<br />
“And how the hell do you propose to do that?” You replied in a less-than-enthusiastic tone, “they have both of our families completely at their mercy. If we go in there making any demands then they’ll transform them all for good; before making sure that we end up joining them.”<br />
<br />
“Quite right,” Nat replied as she looked at you with a knowing smile, “which is why we need to go about things in a more clandestine manner. You see, it will be possible to rescue your loved ones and to hurt the Zoo at the same time, but in order to do so you are both going to have to become animals again…”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made your heart skip a few beats as you wondered whether you had misheard. “Like fuck that’s happening,” you said abruptly as you backed away from Nat, “we’ve only just changed back to normal and now you want to put us through that nightmare again!? Why on earth would we agree to that!?”<br />
<br />
“Please,” Nat said with a roll of her eyes, “there’s no need to be so dramatic…”<br />
<br />
“DRAMATIC!!!!??” You said in a rage, “why don’t you try getting fucked by a stallion and living as a horse for a week! That bitch in there,” you said pointing furiously to the arabian stallion that used to be Vicky, “kidnapped and tortured me to within an inch of losing my humanity. If you had any common sense or compassion you might understand why I’m not too fond of putting myself or Jessica through that hell again.”<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause following your outburst as you stood seething with rage. Meanwhile, Nat seemed to be waiting for you to calm down before continuing.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry,” the mysterious woman finally said in a soft voice, “I can only imagine what you and Jessica went through. I wish I didn’t have to ask you but there is no other way. I can help you rescue your family, but it will not work unless you trust me. I won’t stop you from leaving, but who else is realistically going to help you. And every minute we delay means more innocent people are transformed, all while your family is put through the very same ordeal that you have just escaped from.”<br />
<br />
Nat’s words hung heavily in the air as your anger started to subside. Instead, you felt your heart sink as you tried not to imagine what your parents and sister were currently going through. And although you hated to admit it, you knew that Nat was right; who else would believe what was going on and, more importantly, how on earth would they be able to help if they did?<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” Nat said as she put a comforting hand on your shoulder, “I haven’t explained the rest of my plan. You see, by resisting the curse you and Jessica were able to build up a sort of resistance to it; a bit like how a vaccination works by injecting you with a small dose of a virus. Didn’t you ever wonder why none of the Zoo’s staff are ever transformed by mistake? It is because they have to build up this very same resistance by spending a week as an animal during their training.”<br />
<br />
“You can’t be serious,” you said as you struggled to follow Nat’s explanation, “you’re telling me that everyone who works at the Zoo has spent time as an animal. Does that mean, you…” <br />
<br />
“Yes, a lizard of all creatures,” Nat replied with a smile, “a leopard gecko to be exact. They’re small, resilient and easy to look after; a perfect candidate for training purposes.”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made you shudder as you struggled to picture Nat as a small reptile. Instead, you were now fascinated to learn more about this potential counter to the Zoo’s mysterious curse.<br />
<br />
“So…” you continued after a brief pause, “you are now immune to the curse, supposedly just like me and the rest of the Zoo’s employees? If that is the case though, how come you were still able to transform the ‘bad eggs’ that you keep here? All those cows in the cattle shed, as well as Vicky and that security guy; how were they affected by the curse if they are all supposedly immune?”<br />
<br />
“Because of this…” Nat replied as she whipped out a large syringe filled with murky white liquid. “You see, the resistance I mentioned helps to block out the mental aspects of the curse, whilst also making sure that surface-level interactions with cursed animals have no effect. However, by injecting a fluid sample from another cursed animal directly into the bloodstream we are able to deliver the curse exactly where it needs to go, thus ensuring that we are able to break down those with even the strongest wills.”<br />
<br />
Listening to this made you glance back over to the two horses that used to be Vicky and the Zoo’s disgraced head of security. Disturbingly, both horses were now staring back at you, though with very different emotions on their long equine faces. <br />
<br />
The old head of security, now known as ‘Joanna,’ now looked at you with large, pleading eyes as she whinnied to you pathetically. Clearly, the former-man was distraught over her loss of humanity and gender; and probably her impending pregnancy judging by the amount of gloopy stallion cum that continued to ooze from her despoiled mare sex.<br />
<br />
As for Vicky, or ‘Victory’ as he was now known, the big stallion was still staring daggers at you as he pranced around angrily. You could tell he was getting increasingly frustrated as he whinnied loudly and delivered a few hard kicks to the sturdy fence of his enclosure. <br />
<br />
“...as you can see,” Nat interrupted as she moved beside you to watch the two horses, “animals conditioned in this way take much longer to lose their human minds, which is why we give them a regular top-up of another chemical which at least helps them to enjoy the experience. We add this supplement to their food and water, which helps keep all of our animals in the right frame of mind until they are ready to accept their changes for good…”<br />
<br />
Right on cue, you noticed Joanna bending down to drink from a bucket of water, seemingly unaware that it had been contaminated. Sure enough, the mare’s whole demeanour quickly started to change as she turned away from you and back towards the frisky stallion in the field with her.<br />
<br />
You could only watch in silent amazement as, with a distinctive equine mating call, Joanna slowly turned her enormous ass around and presented it to her intended mate. Then, with a seductive whinny, she raised her tail to one side; revealing the dark, velvety folds of her teardrop-shaped vagina as it continued to drip with the excess of her and Victory’s last coupling.<br />
<br />
As predicted, Victory wasn’t able to resist his stallion urges for long, even in spite of the continued resistance coming from the woman inside. Seeing the horse fighting to keep his wits about him made you feel slightly sorry for him, even if this was once the vile woman that had tortured you back at the Stables.<br />
<br />
Victory kept fighting his urges for as long as he could, but soon the scent of the nearby mare in heat became too much to resist as he slowly turned and trotted up to her. Not long after this and following a few investigatory licks to Joanna’s winking, dripping vagina; Victory soon gave in to his body’s instincts as he roughly mounted his mate from behind.<br />
<br />
Before long, both horses were busy whinnying out in joy as they passionately fucked each other right in front of you. The humans inside were no doubt feeling shame, humiliation and regret; but none of these emotions showed as the couple rutted like the horny animals they now were.<br />
<br />
“Right, I’m sure you get the point,” Nat said as she turned away, just as the two horses signalled their powerful climax with a chorus of passionate whinnies. “In any case, you and Jessica needn’t worry; you will need your human minds to be fully intact for your mission… if you agree to it of course.”<br />
<br />
You didn’t know how to respond as you took a moment to consider your options. You were still highly suspicious of the mysterious woman, especially given the satisfaction she seemed to derive from mocking her transformed victims. And yet, despite everything you had seen, you knew deep down that there was no real alternative. Nat seemed to be the only one with the knowledge, power and motive to help you; which is why you ultimately decided that it would be best to cooperate for the time being.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I’m in,” you finally announced as you looked Nat in the eyes, “where do we start?”<br />
<br />
“Excellent,” came Nat’s reply as she smiled reassuringly, “well, first I suppose we had better see what your colleagues make of all this…”</p>
