<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Benton was in the trashed remains of his study; reading the email detailing the Andersons and Lawsons. While Frieda was successful in destroying the biggest piece of dirt detailing that both families had an open message; Benton just grumbled. The information sent to him is just a more detailed synopsis of what he already knew. He was about to smash his monitor in frustration when a knock came at his study door.<br />
“What is it Jeffery!” Benton barks, not realizing that Jeffery and the entire staff left over his earlier fit of rage.<br />
<br />
Instead Tachibana Akane enters. She studies the carnage of Benton’s study and notes the were-panther behind the desk in a foul mood. Whether it’s from his hangover or seeing the last person he thought would ruin his already miserable day, no one knows.<br />
<br />
“Your wife let me in;” Tachibana states. “She gave me a brief rundown on what to expect when seeing you, but seeing the state of your study, her description does not do justice.”<br />
“What do you want;” Benton half growls and half grumbles.<br />
“I am here for two things;” She sits down on a chair that is not as damaged as all the rest; “First, as the owner of Tachibana industries, finding out of the unwarranted attack upon my employees while you were in your Fursona is unacceptable! As a were yourself you know of the rules about shifting in public during the daylight. What were you thinking?” Tachibana continues ranting; “It’s one thing to be upset over losing to a bad bet regarding a business deal, but to be upset as to try and assault and nearly kill several innocent people. You’re lucky you’re not in jail!”<br />
“Bad business deal?” Benton pipes up; “It took me months to plan my take over. To have it unraveled in seconds? I had every right to be mad;” Benton shouts back.<br />
“Silence;” Tachibana raises her voice. “You tried to take away my grandson’s birthright. Over a petty act that goes all the way back when you two were in high school. You failed; and furthermore, count yourself fortunate that Daisuke didn’t take head earlier today regarding your actions. As a follower of the code of Bushido it would have be his right as you were an enemy to him; barring your fangs. But he chose to follow his Zen Buddhism.”<br />
Benton dealing with a massive headache whispers; “What is the second reason for you being here?”<br />
“I’ll get to that in a bit,” Tachibana answers. She puts down a file on Benton’s desk. “Those are medical bills of the various security personnel you assaulted;” Looking straight at Benton, “you will be paying for it all. Their care, medication, therapy; all of it. And I expect you to personally write a check to Daisuke for the damages you did to my building.”<br />
<br />
Tachibana gets up from the chair she was in. removing a scroll from the inside pocket of her suit, she tosses it to Benton; “That is the second reason as to why I’m here. You of all people should know the penalty of disobeying the ruling of the were council.” Tachibana leaves Benton’s study but stops as she get to the door. “One more thing; “She turns around to see Benton staring at the scroll on his desk. “If you so much as do anything to the Lawson or the Anderson, you will find yourself at war with the Skulk.” With that Tachibana leaves the study to see both Amanda and Frieda hovering nearby, listening to every word said. Tachibana just silently shakes her lead and leaves the Knight household.<br />
<br />
Benton just stares at the scroll. A rolled bit of parchment with a red wax seal; the seal depicting an simple animal paw print. With great trepidation he breaks the seal to read what the were council has written.<br />
<br />
‘We of the were council; after gathering for an emergency meeting to discuss your recent actions at Tachibana headquarters have come to the conclusions that you have and did so willfully violated the towns law of exposing our kind by shifting into your were form in public and in broad daylight. While the act alone was inside an office; the office in question Tachibana headquarters employs both weres&#39; and normals&#39;. Your action endangered the safety of everyone under Tachibana&#39;s employ. We also determine that Daisuke acted in a just and appropriate manner in defense of those under his care. No sanction will be made upon him. As such we the were council levee the following penalties upon you Benton Knight:<br />
<br />
1.	Your seat on the council is hereby stripped from you and shall be held in trust until your daughter Frieda Knight is of the age of majority. At such a time she will be invited to sit on the council to help guide the were community for years to come.<br />
<br />
2.	 Knowing you are a bully who tends to take losses or any acts that slight your ego rather harshly, you are hereby summarily commanded to attend anger management therapy. At a date and time of our choosing. participation is mandatory.<br />
<br />
3.	To ensure your daughter Frieda Knight is capable of sitting in your family’s council seat, we bare you from carting her off to any location outside of the jurisdiction of Moon Lake. She will be made available to be tutored by a council-member of our choosing at dates that do not conflict with her school, and testifying in Julie’s Stovall’s upcoming trial.<br />
<br />
4.	You are hereby commanded to make forthwith any and all reparations to Tachibana industries and to humbly apologize in person to Daisuke a member in waiting of the were-council and future CEO of Tachibana industries.<br />
<br />
We of the were-council make further note that failure to follow these edicts brought forth upon you, will result in a punishment akin to violation the town’s statue 1-A law.&#39;<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Benton put the scroll down; seeing the signatures of the entire council members save his own on the parchment. It is clear that he will not be able to fight his way out. Shifting back into his human form, Benton does what he has not done since Daisuke broke his arm in high school; Benton cries. He experiences fear for the first time. <br />
<br />
His wife Amanda hearing Benton crying, enters the destroyed study to comfort her husband. Seeing the scroll and reading what it states, she understands what just happened. The town has decided that it will no longer put up with Benton’s bully tactics and flagrantly breaking the rules and using his position in society to not be punished. Frieda looking on into the study seeing her parents clearly at a low point; she long gave up waiting for her mother to try and make supper. With a simple ham sandwich in hand she just watches the strange site of her father truly crying and her mother futilely trying to comfort him.<br />
<br />
Frieda leaves the strange scene and heads to her room. Getting on her computer she tries to initiate a skype conversation with Eric and Spencer; only to find that no connection could be established. Thinking that the power is still out in town she finishes her sandwich and heads to bed. Not knowing that Spencer and Eric are in their fursona&#39;s; locked in a lover’s embraced and fast asleep in the Lawson rec room, she drifts of to sleep. What Frieda doesn&#39;t realize is that starting tomorrow, her life as a teenage girl is about to improve for the better.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
With the towns’ were-council effectively muzzling Benton Knight from ever causing future problems a blocking his plans to ship Frieda Knight off as a way to punish her for her life choices, Tachibana leaves the Knight estate. Completing her task as the representative of the were-council to render judgement on Benton, she instructs her driver to return back to her estate, where the two members of the white tiger clan reside as her guests. Tachibana recalls her conversation with Daisuke in the morning regarding a storm on the horizon. With a crack of lighting splitting the sky above them; Tachibana can help but smile at the irony that Mother Nature has provided.</p>
