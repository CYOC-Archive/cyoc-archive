<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and Tulipelle looked quietly around the bedroom that the two of you had been escorted to. As with many of Tulipelle&#39;s home&#39;s decor, flowers seemed to play a major role in much of the &quot;palace&#39;s&quot; decor. The only thing that differed the two was that the Queen&#39;s decor was far more ornate than Tulipelle&#39;s. It was fairly pretty and you even thought so as you looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... this looks nice,&quot; you said after a moment.<br />
<br />
You then turned to see Tulipelle was looking directly at you. Her face was both surprised and curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;You knew what fairy food would do to you?&quot; Tulipelle asked you as you looked to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Errr...&quot; you said as you realized that she had caught on to what you had said in her defense, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;ve looked into a lot old legends on the fey folk on Earth, among other things, but that was mostly to look into a balance with nature... so I know some legends but I can&#39;t say how true they are. So what I know might not be right...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you lied? To the Queen?&quot; Tulipelle gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;More like exaggerated,&quot; you answered, &quot;and besides, it seemed like they were going to throw the book at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The book?&quot; Tulipelle raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;A human expression,&quot; you explained, &quot;to punish you harshly... and you aren&#39;t at fault for what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Irisette, by our rules I am responsible,&quot; Tulipelle said weakly, &quot;If you didn&#39;t know... I should have warned you about what our food would do... or cast a spell to strip our food of its magic so that you could eat it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a silly rule,&quot; you argued, &quot;Yes, I paid for it... yes, I&#39;m likely going to have get used to being a fairy... but I do enjoy a midnight snack, as it has helped me sleep. Even if you had told me... if I couldn&#39;t sleep... I still might have eaten the fruit. So, the mistake was more on me than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You slowly came up to her and actually hugged her. Tulipelle had been so friendly to you, that being friends was a good and easy idea. You wanted her as a friend, and a part of you still wondered if you were falling in love with her. Even with it, you still didn&#39;t want to see a friend punished for your mistakes. Especially when you wanted your friend to help you adjust to being a fairy.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;d like to think you&#39;re my friend... for all the help you&#39;ve given me,&quot; you said to her as the two of you hugged, &quot;you could have easily left me to die. Instead you came and helped me and offered to help me get home. The fact that you failed to warn me doesn&#39;t matter... you&#39;re my friend, and I will stand by you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Irisette...&quot; Tulipelle said softly and you saw a slight twinkle in her eye.<br />
<br />
The hug was soon cut short when you heard Tulipelle&#39;s stomach rumble. Your own stomach rumbled shortly after. That made both of you take a couple of steps back and looking down. You ended up rubbing the back of your head as you realized that neither you nor Tulipelle had had any breakfast. You woke up and learned Tulipelle&#39;s name and then learned what your name was now. Then almost immediately you were summoned to be brought before the Queen. Neither of you had had breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we could get some breakfast,&quot; Tulipelle said after a moment.<br />
<br />
You nodded. Breakfast sounded good, and now that you were a fairy, the magic in fairy food wasn&#39;t an issue now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know where the kitchen is?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... but our escorts should be outside the door,&quot; Tulipelle answered.<br />
<br />
The two of you turned to head out the door, and the two guards that had escorted you to the bedroom stood quietly on both sides of the door. Both of the guards looked to the two of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is their something you need?&quot; one guard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are a bit hungry,&quot; Tulipelle spoke, &quot;as the summons came before we could have breakfast. I don&#39;t suppose we could go to the kitchen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both guards nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; the first guard gave a smile, &quot;you are guests of the Queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then lead you through the hallways of the palace. They curved in ways that went around to help shape the inside of the palace, It made some sense to you, as fairy homes and dwellings seemed to be built into the trees, without damaging them. This had to mean there was a great deal of magic involved either the trees themselves or in fairy construction techniques. Eventually you came to an extensive kitchen that included many different elements. Again it was similar in Tulipelle&#39;s kitchen in many ways but was more ornate. You could also feel a pulse of magic from certain aspects of the kitchen, including what looked like a large stove with some sort of vine making up the heating coils.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you want for breakfast?&quot; the second guard asked to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could go for some hummingbird eggs and acorns,&quot; Tulipelle spoke.<br />
<br />
You figured that fairies raised hummingbirds the way humans raised chickens. Though you wondered on how it worked. The hummingbirds that had pulled the carriage that had carried you and Tulipelle to the giant tree that was the Queen&#39;s palace were the same size of hummingbirds on Earth. They were tiny compared to humans, they were big in comparison to fairies. That would mean, even if their eggs were small compared to humans, they&#39;d be big comparison to fairies. A lot of this was in contrast to the cherries you&#39;d eaten the previous night that resulted in your transformation. They weren&#39;t the normal color of cherries and they were proportionately the same size to you as a fairy now as cherries on Earth had been to you as a human.<br />
<br />
That guard nodded, and actually began set about cooking the breakfast that Tulipelle had asked for. You then looked to see the first guard looking to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would you like?&quot; that guard asked.<br />
<br />
That actually made you think. You were still adjusting to being a fairy and were actually looking forward to learning from Tulipelle, and so you didn&#39;t know about all the foods that fairies ate or what they considered breakfast, lunch, or dinner foods. You&#39;d eaten the cherries because you liked the fruit on Earth and figured it&#39;d be a good snack.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you have any cereal?&quot; you asked hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we have cereals... they&#39;re rather simple and commonly have fruit mixed in,&quot; the guard answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cherries?&quot; you practically blurted, sounding hopeful, and feeling your wings beat in excitement behind you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe so,&quot; the guard almost giggled at the sight of your reaction, &quot;Why don&#39;t you two go through that door there and wait in the dinning room. We&#39;ll come out with your breakfast in a moment.&quot;</p>
