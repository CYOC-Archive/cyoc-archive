<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Nellie Lyons accompanied Martha Anderson through the check out line at the local K-mart, she said, &quot;By the way, how do you look when....&quot; but couldn&#39;t finish the question because there were normals about.<br />
&quot;Very sexy,&quot; Martha whispered in her old friend and future lover&#39;s ear, &quot;as you&#39;ll find out soon enough,&quot; giving her a quick peck on the cheek before putting her items for purchase on the conveyor belt at the register.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
That magic hour approached for all students.<br />
The end of the class day!<br />
As the last bell rang shortly after 3 that Monday afternoon, Nate Anderson approached Alex Ramsey. The high school Juniors had their last classes across for each other, which the two werewolves in love enjoyed.<br />
&quot;Hey handsome,&quot; said Nate, standing in the hallway as Alex came near. &quot;Ready to go home?&quot;<br />
&quot;You bet,&quot; replied Alex, before he whispered in Nate&#39;s ear, &quot;I know this sounds cliche, but your place or mine stud?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s got to be mine I&#39;m afraid. I&#39;ve got some killer Algebra homework to tackle first, and you know how my parents are about education,&quot; answered Nate.<br />
&quot;Mine too,&quot; Alex reminded him. &quot;But with me tonight it&#39;s World History. If I help you will you help me?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; said Nate. &quot;And then I hope sometime before our respective curfews we get to help each other scratch a mutual itch,&quot; he whispered in Alex&#39;s ear, before giving his boyfriend a quick peck on the cheek as they walked out to Nate&#39;s car.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Eric Anderson and Julie Stovall couldn&#39;t wait to see each other again!<br />
The recently engaged were-mer couple had their last classes of the day on opposite sides of the school from each other.<br />
&quot;You have no idea how badly I missed you,&quot; Eric said, smiling at his one true love as she approached.<br />
&quot;It can&#39;t be any less than I&#39;ve missed you my sea king,&quot; teased Julie, grabbing his hand in hers. &quot;Ready for our walk home?&quot;<br />
&quot;You bet. Got everything?&quot; asked Eric, as he started to lead them out of the school building.<br />
&quot;I do now,&quot; she said with a smile, tightening her grip on him.<br />
<br />
The young couple walked hand in hand, both smiling as they started on the journey to Julie Stovall&#39;s house, since Eric was expected for dinner.<br />
Julie&#39;s father Martin was supposed to be home today from visiting his mother in California, and Julie was sure her father would want to talk to Eric man to man, especially once he found out Eric was now also her fiance.<br />
After crossing the street and finding themselves officially off school grounds, the couple paused long enough to share a deep, passionate kiss. &quot;I&#39;ve been wanting to do that all day,&quot; confessed Julie, once their lips finally parted.<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; admitted Eric, before giving her a more normal, quick peck on the lips. &quot;Are you sure this longing between us is supposed to become manageable in time?&quot;<br />
&quot;I sure hope so, but the reunions are great,&quot; Julie said with a smile, before putting an arm around Eric.<br />
<br />
They took their time walking back to her house, enjoying every moment together.<br />
Once they finished going over their respective school days after Freshman lunch, Julie started telling Eric what kind of conversation he might expect from her father.<br />
&quot;Especially once he sees this,&quot; began Julie, indicating the single pearl necklace around her neck Eric gave Julie after becoming a were-merman, &quot;he&#39;ll want to know about your future plans, prospects, how you intend to treat me. All that melodrama stuff fathers are supposed to ask their daughter&#39;s beaus.&quot;<br />
&quot;So it will be more than just checking out my new scale pattern,&quot; realized Eric.<br />
&quot;He definitely will still want to do that too. Blue-green is pretty rare amongst were-mers for some reason. I&#39;ve never seen any were-merman or mermaid with it at any of our gatherings.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry my precious sea jewel. I won&#39;t let you, our love, or our future children down*,&quot; promised Eric.<br />
&quot;Well, he is home,&quot; observed Julie, noticing his car in the driveway as they approached the Stovall family home.<br />
<br />
Julie let herself in with her key, but even though a were-mer&#39;s senses were not as acute out of the water as they were in it, it did not require a genius to figure out what happened after Martin Stovall returned home to his wife.<br />
&quot;She couldn&#39;t wait,&quot; said Julie, spotting the clothes strewn across the living room floor and his suitcase untouched by the front door. &quot;I know the feeling,&quot; she added, pulling Eric into a loving embrace as they kissed once more.<br />
&quot;So does that mean they&#39;re upstairs...&quot; wondered Eric, as each child took their backpacks off.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go look,&quot; she replied, nosily running upstairs to announce her presence in case they needed time to make themselves presentable.<br />
But Julie came back down alone, shaking her head negatively.<br />
&quot;Then they&#39;ve got to be outside,&quot; realized Eric, as they started for the house&#39;s rear exit in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Quietly, they approached the edge of the Stovall&#39;s fresh water swimming pool in the backyard and looked down. There, still sound asleep after their passionate reunion &quot;swim&quot;, Julie&#39;s parents were lovingly embraced in each other&#39;s arms.<br />
&quot;Aw...&quot; began Eric, as Julie pulled him away from the edge.<br />
Then she started kissing him while unbuttoning his shirt.<br />
&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing honey?&quot; asked Eric, as she removed her own top.<br />
&quot;You have to ask?&quot; said Julie in return, even as she reached for Eric&#39;s belt buckle.<br />
<br />
A gentle rocking motion in the water awoke Melissa Stovall.<br />
Seeing her husband still asleep in her arms, she looked around and beheld Julie and Eric in their Stage 2 forms in the middle of the pool.<br />
Her daughter had her goldfish scaled legs wrapped around her lover as the two were firmly embraced and kissing, Julie on top loving every moment of being with her man even as Eric held Julie&#39;s hips as his fiance continued to thrust herself against his body.<br />
With no nudity taboos in were society, Melissa just smiled at the young lovers before looking down at her husband.<br />
<br />
Martin Stovall awoke to a stronger rocking motion in the water.<br />
Opening his eyes, he found himself laying across the bottom of the deep end of the pool as his wife was enjoying herself on his thick merman appendage, the shaft of his scaled penis going deep within her mermaid tail.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he began to ask, when his wife simply smiled and said, &quot;Enjoy the moment,&quot; before kissing him.<br />
Martin reached up and caressed her firm breasts, enjoying their weight and feel even as he felt his wife shudder before continuing to urge him on to mutual orgasmic bliss.<br />
Then a noise attracted his attention.<br />
Martin turned his head and saw his daughter and her lover, oops, fiance, according to Melissa, elsewhere in the pool, doing basically the same thing they were.<br />
<i>Eric&#39;s scales really are blue-green!</i> realized Martin, as Melissa gently extended a hand long enough to turn his head back toward her before bending down and giving him a very passionate kiss as she urged him onward to their mutual goal.<br />
<br />
