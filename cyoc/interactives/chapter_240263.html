<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[June&#39;s viewpoint]<br />
<br />
Ty walked into the kitchen, and June was surprised that Mark did as well. She had needed his support only moments ago. Could she do this on her own now?<br />
<br />
Dustin suddenly started screaming incoherently, though he still couldn&#39;t move his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin, honey, calm down please,&quot; she asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! Did Ty hurt you? I&#39;ll kill that little twerp,&quot; Dustin shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Dustin, Ty didn&#39;t hurt me. Please calm down, and we&#39;ll talk it over, &quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looked like he hurt you somehow,&quot; Dustin said, not quite in a shout. &quot;I&#39;m never going to let him do that! Why didn&#39;t Dad protect you from that creep? What&#39;s wrong with Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing&#39;s wrong with your father, or with me,&quot; she reassured him. &quot;Ty did give us a lot to think about, but he didn&#39;t hurt us. I saw that you tried to defend me, and I&#39;m proud of you for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tnanks, Mom!&quot; Dustin said, &quot;But I still don&#39;t like the things Ty has done to you and Dad! And to me! I want to tear that little asswipe&#39;s head off! And I still can&#39;t move! What has he done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I want to talk with you about, honey,&quot; she replied. &quot;But you need to be very calm. I don&#39;t think Ty will let you go until you calm down. And he&#39;s your brother. Don&#39;t call him bad names.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only a step brother!&quot; Dustin spat, &quot;and how can I be calm when he has done these things to us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin, it&#39;s more our fault than yours, but we have to stop always thinking of him as &#39;step&#39;. He&#39;s our son, and your brother, &quot; she said, &quot;We need to stop harping on the fact that he&#39;s adopted, and start treating him better.&quot;<br />
<br />
She could see that Dustin was having a hard time with this idea. &quot;Why are you suddenly on his side?&quot; She noticed that he was speaking in a more normal tone of voice, though. Maybe she&#39;d get Ty to release him soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin, honey,&quot; she explained, &quot;it&#39;s not that I&#39;m taking &#39;his side&#39; now. I think you know that parents aren&#39;t supposed to take sides. You&#39;re both our sons, but now your father and I see that we&#39;ve both treated him badly, and we&#39;ve been wrong to do that. We&#39;re all going to have to work at being nicer to each other. That includes you not taunting him so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I still need to get back at him for what he&#39;s done to me! And for hurting you and Dad&quot; June saw that Dustin was almost on the brink of tears, but she knew he wouldn&#39;t want him to see any sign of weakness, so she tried to ignore that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin,&quot; she said, &quot;Ty hasn&#39;t hurt any of us. It&#39;s OK for you to be angry at him, and Mark and I are too. But we&#39;re all going to have to let that go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe he didn&#39;t hurt you and Dad,&quot; Dustin said, &quot;but he hurt me, changing my body back to 13 years old.&quot; June still wasn&#39;t sure she believed that, even though Ty had confirmed it. It still seemed so impossible. But then, freezing them in place was impossible too, wasn&#39;t it? Anyhow, while she was frozen, she had decided to try to keep an open mind about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you doing to him when he made this change to you,&quot; June asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Teasing him about being so underdeveloped,&quot; Dustin admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s so, don&#39;t you think maybe you deserved something back from him&quot;, June asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Mom, this...&quot; Dustin protested, &quot;this is too much!&quot;<br />
<br />
June though a moment. &quot;Yes, maybe it is.  But you&#39;ve been taunting him a long time, haven&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eyes downcast, Dustin quietly admitted, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s not just taunting, is it?&quot; June asked, &quot;You shove him and trip him too, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin seems to shrink, and spoke even quieter, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
June asked him, &quot;Well, maybe Ty&#39;s revenge is excessive, but don&#39;t you think maybe you&#39;ve earned some of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
A few seconds passed, then so quietly that she could barely hear him, he admitted, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So maybe you should go easy on him now,&quot; June suggested, &quot;treat him with a little more respect?&quot;<br />
<br />
A bit of Dustin&#39;s defiance came back. He raised his head, looked her in the eye, and said, &quot;But Mom! What&#39;s he&#39;s done to me! No guy could accept that. I have to do _something_!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... &quot; June thought to herself. &quot;I think I should point out something Dustin may not have considered.&quot; She spoke aloud, &quot;Dustin, you said that Ty changed your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Dustin agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he has frozen you in place,&quot; June continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Dustin agreed, his voice rising.<br />
<br />
She asked, &quot;Do you know anyone else that can do such things?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s face fell. &quot;No,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
June continued, &quot;If Ty can make changes to your body, and freeze you, have you thought about what else he might be able to do?&quot; Obviously Dustin had _not_ thought about that. He didn&#39;t reply, but his head shivered a bit. June knew that if Dustin had been in control of his body, his whole body would have shivered. He was probably terrified. She wanted to comfort him. &quot;But Dustin,&quot; she said, raching out to hold his head in her hands, &quot;Ty hasn&#39;t done whatever worse things we might imagine. To any of us. He apologized for changing you, and said he&#39;d change you back. He froze us, but didn&#39;t harm us. I think he could have. Very easily. But he said he doesn&#39;t want to hurt us. I think he&#39;s telling the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded, miserably.<br />
<br />
&quot;So if I tell Ty that you&#39;ve calmed down,&quot; June asked Dustin, &quot;and ask him to release you, will you promise me that you&#39;ll stay calm, be polite to Ty, and not try to get revenge?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Dustin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And will you apologize to Ty for all of the taunting you&#39;ve given him over the years?&quot; June asked.<br />
<br />
Dustin gulped, but again replied, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot; June smiled, leaned over Dustin&#39;s still frozen form,  awkwardly hugged him, and kissed him on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty,&quot; June called, &quot;Would you come back out here, please?&quot;</p>
