<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I'm alright with the Newishdemonwriter. So far, your writing isn't too bad. I like it, and it does help us greatly in writing this (though I can't speak on ChronoSeth's behalf).<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think that because Isaac has corruption from the ice demon and the lava salamanders (or salavamanders, as I'd call them), they should be able to control their temperature at the great expense of energy. Ilvir can also do this, but not to a great degree.<br/>
<br/>
Isaac's seed was the catalyst that quickened Ilvir's transformation; it was full of magic, more than what skin-to-skin contact could only give.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Isaac’s body grew to accommodate the corruption from the three lava salamanders, Isaac felt a surge of lust as he furiously masturbated to alleviate it. His hand stroked the thick shaft as it only thickened in his hand before splitting into two separate members. Using his lower set of arms, he stroked his two new members as he felt the pleasure increase twofold.<br />
<br />
Isaac’s pants and groans as well as his mental link with him made Ilvir feel flustered. He couldn’t help it; he was already doing the same as he felt his seed churn within him.<br />
<br />
However, Ilvir’s want to please Isaac both physically and emotionally urged him closer to Isaac’s body, wanting to ride one of his thick cocks. Ilvir began to lower himself on one of them, to Isaac’s pleased grunts. Isaac’s member felt warm and cold at the same time, as the two magical elements fought in his body for dominance. However, it seemed that the two formed a compromise as Ilvir could feel the alternating shift in temperature as he rode it. Isaac moaned as Ilvir’s tight hole wrapped around his member, causing it to throb inside him.<br />
<br />
Isaac’s heightened libido and increased corruption made him more virile as his sack grew a bit more, his testicles rivaling the size beach balls (if beach balls existed then). Ilvir could feel how it also shifted in temperature, becoming warm and then cold after some time. He and Isaac could’ve sworn they both heard a low, gurgling noise from it as Ilvir thrust his hips down on Isaac. Isaac was getting closer…<br />
<br />
…and then he came. With a wolfish howl, he gripped Ilvir’s hips as his one member started filling him nigh instantly, bloating his stomach a bit. Thanks to his partly muddy body and the magic bonds that held it together, Ilvir’s stomach was pretty accommodating as he took every drop from that one member. The other spasmed and shot out jets of glowing purple cum, bathing Ilvir with it as it got absorbed into his skin.<br />
<br />
When Ilvir made contact with Isaac’s fluids, it only hastened the unnoticeable transformation his body was going through. His body, partly made of ice, became warm as he glowed purple too like Isaac. His member split into two as the feeling of Ilvir’s orgasm doubled. His sack grew and so did his body, taking only a portion of what Isaac gained.<br />
<br />
After that messy coitus, the two of them looked at each other. Isaac didn’t mind that Ilvir became submissive towards Isaac again; it had already become a part of his nature as a golem. However, he noticed that Ilvir looked similar to him in the glowing purple veins as well as in the double dicks. Pulling out, Isaac tried standing up, his legs a bit weak after that encounter.<br />
<br />
Isaac didn’t change much other than in his size, muscle mass, and his genitals. He only noticed that he could change his body temperature to his will as he could shift from icy coldness to sweltering heat. He tried it out, but he only got tired because of it. Apparently, it was very costly in energy as Isaac found himself needing a rest after that. It was best that he should stay at a constant temperature.<br />
<br />
Ilvir changed in the same way Isaac did, though his changes were less compared to Isaac. He was still shorter than Isaac by a few feet, and his members weren’t as large as Isaac’s.<br />
<br />
“Are you alright?” Ilvir asked his creator as thick seed slowly dripped out of him.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah…” Isaac said, his members softening a bit. He would need to find some more metal to make another codpiece though, as one of his cocks was protected whereas the other wasn’t. However, the two of them were sure that there were no more creatures in the room as they advanced towards the hallway, getting out of that infernal room.</p>
