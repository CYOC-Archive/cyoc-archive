<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unsure what to do next Erika runs back to her room. She nervously twiddles her braided hair. She searched her bed for the empty salva bottle. Taking a closer look at some small text below the spray nozzle. <br />
<br />
“Newfoundland’s Salva, work-dog hormones for hair growth. Apply to skin, ingestion is not recommended.” <br />
<br />
At this point, Erika was huffing badly and was unknowingly drooling on herself. She closes her mouth to steady the breathing. “I’m okay. I’m fine….It&#39;s okay.” She sits down on her bed, slowly breathing through her nose. The constant huffing was now controlled. <br />
<br />
However this came paired with a sudden flash of heat. She was hot all over her body, sweat beads formed on her head. Condensation spread on her glasses. Her mind slips away from controlling her breathing and she begins to pant again. <br />
<br />
As she panted the heat suddenly subsided. She was struck by how her body cooled down so efficiently.<br />
<br />
As she huffs, a loud pop is heard from beneath her chest. Something inside of her feels different. She runs her hands across her cloth covered chest. Her right rib has pushed forward a few inches. <br />
<br />
Erika was surprised to say the least. She would have expected this to come with a cramp or pain yet it seemed she had broken a bone with no pain whatsoever. <br />
<br />
She feels a slight pressure in her chest before both her rib cages push outward into her shirt. “OoHhhh !!!” She moans as her torso starts barreling out, her organs rearranged inside her. Erika’s shirt buttons burst open and expose her pale glistening chest. A patch of hair had begun growing between the cups of her training bra.<br />
<br />
It isn&#39;t painful but it&#39;s so alien and stimulating that her young mind can’t handle it. “OhRuuughh !” Her tongue dangles out of her mouth as a large glob of slobber slithers from her mouth.<br />
<br />
Her body begins the process of expanding. She&#39;s becoming a Newfoundland, so she has some growing to do. It starts with a creak in her fingers. Erika watches as her hands ballooned up as if she&#39;s having an allergic reaction. Like ink on a paper towel, the skin on her hand darkens to a charcoal as heavy black hair sprouts. Thick pads blister out of the palm of her hand as she watches in terror. <br />
<br />
“Whah Lhe fwihk !” She says, her thickening, extending tongue drooping past her chin. There was a pop behind her face. The bridge of her nose thickens and stretches the plastic nose guards of her glasses. Her nose pitched upward giving her a pig-like nose before it darkens into a jet black shine. Erika crosses her eyes to try and see her changing nose. Then, with an alien pressure, her nose pushes forward. “Whah…huff huff ah-BOORF.” Her voice is deepening now, sounding less like a sweet girl and more like the fat hairy beast she was becoming.  <br />
<br />
She stands from the bed, and walks over to the bedroom mirror. Her face has stretched forward 7 inches and is still growing. Her training-bra finally falls off her increasingly hairy chest. She watches in horror as her cheeks and gums thicken and sag into fluttering jowls that leak saliva like a faucet. Her once cute face is now an amalgamation between human and beast. <br />
<br />
The skirt that had been strained from the start finally snapped and fell off Erika&#39;s thickening waist. Erika’s pink and white panties are now exposed and feeling the strain of fat canine girth.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when she felt a shifting in her feet. She looks down at her shoes to see them ballooning much like her hands did. She tries to undo the buckle on her flats, but her fat paws are too stubby to do anything. Said buckle soon snapped under the pressure of her growing soon to be paws. The leather flats stretch as the socks conceal the claw and fur growth temporally. <br />
<br />
“Naaoourrr-ARKF !” Her spine cracks and she falls forward onto her hands and knees. Accompanied by some gut wrenching crunches, her legs adjust backward so her knee joints are closer to her body.<br />
<br />
Her spine cracks again and her tailbone jutted outward into the printed cotton of her panties, tenting them upward awkwardly. <br />
<br />
Her body was still expanding steadily, she was now double her original weight and was looking puffy and hairy enough to rival her father. <br />
<br />
“WHRrhh WHARRrrROOF.” Her flabby jowls wetly flutter as she tries calling for something to come save her.<br />
<br />
The changes are coming faster now. Her bulging flats explode open and expose her stompy black paws. A large black duster-like tail breaks through the strained cotton of her panties. What remains of her shirt rips off her arms as long dense black fur pushes out. Her cute braided hair simply falls off of her head replaced by a comparatively short coat of fur. <br />
<br />
Her brain cries out in one last protest. “WORF WORF WORF WRRrrr-...Huff Huff Huff Huff.” Suddenly her brain is wiped clean. She’s a dog inside and out, with no memory of her previous life.  Her glasses slide off of her snout, she has no need for them anymore.<br />
<br />
She now has a new purpose. She walks back over to the salva bottle on the floor, and lets a large glob of drool fill the small bottle. The cycle was now complete.<br />
<br />
“Erika ! I’m home early!” A woman&#39;s voice and a knock come from the bedroom door. ‘Who is this ?’ Erika thinks, wagging her tail in excitement. “Mrs.White says you&#39;ve missed your homework again and i&#39;m not putting-” The woman pauses as soon as she sees the gargantuan canine in her daughters room. Almost immediately she spotted the dog&#39;s underwear that was somehow still hugging its massive body. Looking less like a pair of printed undies and more like a novelty thong for this massive boof. However she recognized it, along with the other scraps of clothing strewn around the dog. <br />
<br />
Unless Erika decided to prank her parents by ripping up her clothes and bringing this random dog into her room. That&#39;s out of character for little Erika though. Unless this dog had devoured Erika without a single drop of blood. How did it get in ?<br />
<br />
No…It had to be.<br />
<br />
“Erika ?....”<br />
<br />
“Huff Huff Huff-WORF !”<br />
<br />
A loud scream fills the house as the situation dawns on her. Running across the house to call anyone that could help. Her daughter was a dog, it was unbelievable but there was no other possibility. <br />
<br />
In the commotion the bottle is forgotten. Erika had transformed, and now it was someone else&#39;s turn.</p>
