<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maggie Lawson was well versed in Moon Lake&#39;s secrets. She&#39;d grown up the daughter of a werecat mother and a wereleopard/panther father and had grown up in the small town in Washington State. In this she was well aware of were behaviors and urges, as she did have her memories of growing up with them. They could be quite enticing when one wasn&#39;t used to them, and even those that were used to them weren&#39;t truly above engaging in a little fun to satisfy their urges. And as the wife of a were was active military and would periodically be away from her, she knew she would have those urges, and thus the sex toy that she&#39;d found her daughter playing with. <br />
<br />
To most mothers, this would be something that would deserve a severe scolding, particularly in households that tried to teach that sex was a &quot;bad&quot; thing. However, no were family was like normal human families, and as a were mother, Maggie was no exception. She ignored the scent of arousal that presently filled her daughter&#39;s room and stood by calmly as Spencer stood up, removing the silicone toy from between her legs as she did so. A lot of this was probably just Spencer getting used to being in a place where she could be more open with the fact that she was a were than in most places. Maggie in fact remembered that a lot of normals who became weres often seemed to be a bit more eager than weres who had been were born weres, likely as they adjusted to new hormones and instincts. Spencer had been born a were, but since areas where weres could be freely open with who they were as beings were few and far between, that had meant that Spencer had had to suppress a lot in her life, just to keep the existence of weres a secret. Coming to Moon Lake, however, suddenly reversed that and Maggie was certain the situation for Spencer was like that of a child told continually they can&#39;t have candy suddenly taken to a candy store and told they could eat to their heart&#39;s content.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will expect that to be thoroughly cleaned before you return it to where you found it,&quot; Maggie spoke, pointing to dildo in her daughter&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mom,&quot; Spencer answered looking down, and blushing heavily at having gotten caught. That really wasn&#39;t what she expected, and she was glad she was presently in her were form, as her black fur hid her blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not angry with you, Spencer,&quot; Maggie answered noting her daughter looking down and avoiding eye contact with her, figuring this had also played to certain past issues.<br />
<br />
Spencer wasn&#39;t a bad kid, though there had been plenty of times where it seemed like she wanted more attention. But with her father going from deployment to deployment and the family having to move when it was for a lengthy deployment shift and in an area that wasn&#39;t a combat zone and being away when those deployments took him on missions beyond US borders and leaving Maggie and Spencer behind and with Maggie often working full time as a nurse whenever she could, Spencer had often been alone. This meant some periodic acts of teenage rebellion just to get attention. It was nothing vile or violent... but it was something that had given the Lawson family some issues at home and gave Spencer&#39;s parents plenty to be frustrated with. <br />
<br />
This, however, didn&#39;t really fit with that. Maggie might have some issue with the cursing, which she was sure Spencer had picked up from her father, but even that wasn&#39;t the issue that seemed to be the biggest thing at the moment. There seemed to be some self-frustration on Spencer&#39;s part that Maggie detected and that was truly what concerned her at the moment. Everything else, including the fact that she&#39;d caught her daughter playing with HER sex toy was relatively minor.<br />
<br />
Spencer slowly walked from her bedroom across the hall to a small bathroom and placed the toy into the sink before turning on the water. She avoided her mother&#39;s gaze, but knew that Maggie had followed her and stood in the doorway to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can clean it, mom,&quot; Spencer said weakly, &quot;I don&#39;t need you to monitor me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a question of making sure you clean it, Spencer,&quot; Maggie answered with a sigh, &quot;to some extent it&#39;s not even the fact that you found and used it. Trust me... I&#39;m well aware of how interested a growing were can be in these things... especially when knowing just what her parents are doing in their bedroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eww!&quot; Spencer answered, not liking the implied image of her grandparents having sex, even though she knew that her mother&#39;s parents were young enough with regard to weres that that sort of thing wasn&#39;t completely out of the picture. It was just an image she&#39;d rather not have in her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you know how aware I am of you being different from other weres,&quot; Maggie continued.<br />
<br />
Spencer slowly nodded as that related to her status as a hybrid. It was something that was rather rare among weres for their were-species to hybridize. It wasn&#39;t that weres of two different were-species dating or being with each other was rare, but with regard to their children, it was far more common that the children would take the species of the parent who&#39;s gender they matched. In rare occasions, however, those were species hybridized. And both Maggie and Spencer represented that, as Maggie was part werecat and part wereleopard/panther while Spencer also had werewolf added in. It was something that was pretty much a one in a million chance, especially when having it repeat from generation to generation. In that, Spencer was a special case and that her family had had to go through pretty complicated means to make sure that Spencer&#39;s were-birth control pills were specially designed given that her genetic make-up was hybridized.<br />
<br />
Spencer simply continued the work of washing off the dildo, and even applying some anti-bacterial soap hat would help clean the sex toy. She glanced to her mother, who continued to stand by quietly in the doorway. Though her embarrassment was enough to keep her relatively quiet. However, Maggie didn&#39;t leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that you&#39;re probably going through a lot,&quot; Maggie commented, &quot;as Moon Lake is different from anything you&#39;ve experienced while your father was on active duty. You&#39;re really free to be a were here. It&#39;s something that a lot of people love. Growing up... I saw plenty of normals who became weres really get excited about it. They found out that being a were wasn&#39;t like the movies and they wanted to revel in all that came with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was born a were, mom,&quot; Spencer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The principle is still the same, dear,&quot; Maggie commented, &quot;as you had to hide who and what you were from others and we never found another were that could be there for you... Now... you are quite free to be YOU.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spencer didn&#39;t answer as she looked to her mother. Her parents had generally tended to be rather conservative with things, be it in economics, foreign affairs, and security issues. They were more tolerant with regard to social issues, as her mother was like her in that she was bisexual as well, though that didn&#39;t quite mean that they openly wanted her going &quot;out&quot; before. Of course, some of that could be with regard to the were secret, but there were times where Spencer couldn&#39;t be sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s something that can create a rush,&quot; Maggie commented, &quot;and trust me... even being a born were in Moon Lake can have that effect, especially, after I met your father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Moooooooooom!&quot; Spencer groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just saying there is nothing inherently wrong with being attracted to someone,&quot; Maggie answered, &quot;just so long as you remain respectful and accepting of them. You&#39;ll be able to make friends here that will understand you are a were and will not fear you for it. And if things go beyond that and they are willing... it could lead to the things you think are gross when it&#39;s your father and I. The big thing will be accept where there are differences.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a couple saying they&#39;re engaged with a pearl necklace, even though they&#39;re both fourteen?&quot; Spencer asked, as her thoughts drifted to Eric Anderson and Julie Stovall.<br />
<br />
&quot;A pearl necklace?&quot; Maggie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard something that weremers do that in their courtship,&quot; Maggie mused, &quot;though... I&#39;ve never heard of one doing so at fourteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... it&#39;d be okay to say I like them?&quot; Spencer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least with regard to platonic friendship,&quot; Maggie answered, &quot;if you actually want something more than that... you&#39;d need to be honest with them and find out whether or not they&#39;re willing FIRST. As just because they&#39;re weres doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t say &quot;no,&quot; and your father and I DID teach you to understand that, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Spencer nodded, &quot;but that pull... with the male in particular... it&#39;s strong... and it&#39;s like I need... more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maggie blinked and paused for a moment. She gave a low sniff test as she stood in the doorway to the bathroom. She could easily pick up Spencer&#39;s scent and could tell its component parts and whether or not she was aroused. For the moment, it seemed like her arousal had gone done from where it was a few moments before, but then, that was likely the result of her overhearing something from Spencer&#39;s room and catching her in the act, as it were. However, she did also detect a certain aspect of her daughter&#39;s scent that gave her some clue. It wasn&#39;t super strong, and Maggie, as a werecat/wereleopard/panther hybrid didn&#39;t have as strong a sense of smell as her werewolf husband did, but it was still good enough to determine what might be going on with Spencer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... puberty can be rough,&quot; Maggie said calmly, &quot;it can be rough on anyone, though particularly on weres with all those hormones going at levels higher than what goes with normal humans... and in your case as a hybrid were in particular. It&#39;s something that makes you and I rather different from others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t explain anything,&quot; Spencer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re coming into heat, Spencer,&quot; Maggie Lawson spoke before her daughter staggered and then fainted forward into her mother&#39;s arms, not expecting the answer that Maggie gave.</p>
