<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Johnathan, the genie, had to admit he was quite impressed with the pious brunette. Most of his previous masters rashly began making their desires come true, without regard for the possible consequences of their actions. It was how Johnathan was so easily able to manipulate them. This one would be different, Johnathan thought to himself. Just as Tyler slowly planned out his wishes, Johnathan would slowly corrupt the 20 year old fanatic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I think I figured it out Johnathan,&quot; Tyler announced. &quot;For my first wish, I wish that my entire class is now seated in our church, and I am transported to the church&#39;s front stage.&quot;<br />
<br />
A good start, Johnathan thought. It was easy to manipulate, too. &quot;I wish that my entire class is now ALL MALE AND seated in our church and I am transported to the church&#39;s front stage,&quot; Tyler now wished. In an instant, Tyler found himself standing in front of a large crowd, smiling lecherously as he realized the wish worked. Amongst the audience, Tyler&#39;s former classmates sat, confused as to why they had all come to their town&#39;s cult. The church had often preached awful things: violence against non-believers, destruction of nonreligious property and bigotry, to name a few. Most of the town was disgusted by the stain on their community and often mourned the loss of someone who&#39;d been successfully converted by the evil preacher and his family. Coming to the church was absolutely unacceptable to most, so the fact that Tyler&#39;s entire graduating class sat in the church was not pleasing to most people in the room.<br />
<br />
Tyler, on the other hand, was overjoyed. Here, all the people who made his life miserable solely because he tried to preach the truth sat helpless to his will. He was going to use his power to correct the wrongs done to him. So what if he&#39;d made the entire class male? Women were a distraction from God&#39;s plan, in Tyler&#39;s mind. Not to mention, the students were completely oblivious to it. It was simply an interesting phenomenon that all of Tyler&#39;s class happened to be male. No one understood how but no one questioned it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello my former classmates. I bet you all are wondering why you&#39;ve been seated in the one true church with your fellow heathens. I can assure you that all will be answered soon. You see, all of you in some way had forsaken the divine path when I knew you and that&#39;s simply not alright. I have now been given power by God himself, and because of this, I know that have been chosen to correct the wrongs that have been done to this church, starting with this satanic class; so get ready to understand the truth,&quot; Tyler finished, satisfied with his opening remarks. He soon began to frown, however, as many of the students began getting up, ready to walk out the door, shaking their heads in disbelief.<br />
<br />
That wouldn&#39;t do, Tyler thought to himself. &quot;Johnathan, I wish that everyone would stay in this room until I say so,&quot; Tyler declared. Of course, with Johnathan&#39;s help, Tyler now declared, &quot;I wish that everyone would stay HARD AND AROUSED in this room until I say so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feigning innocence, Johnathan, who simply stood in the corner of the room, nodded and changed the desires of those in the room. Those who got ready to leave stopped in their footsteps, suddenly realizing that for some reason they wanted to stay in the crazy church. Furthermore, no one wanted to get up, for fear of everyone seeing their obvious erections that no one could control. The confusion simply increased due to this; so much so that many were simply left speechless questioning why they were so horny here of all places? As the crowd began settling down, Tyler smiled to himself. Sure, maybe it was a little weird to wish for even him to have an erection, but Tyler reasoned that it would distract them from his true intentions. Because of this, now began the real fun.<br />
<br />
Tyler gazed around the room, noticing with disgust the amount of college memorabilia that adorned his classmates. They were so faithful to those institutions, they lacked the ability to see beyond them. Those clothes would be the first to go. &quot;Johnathan, I wish that everyone in this room only owned and liked the church&#39;s clothing,&quot; Tyler stated.<br />
<br />
At least, that&#39;s what he wanted to say. Instead, Tyler stated, &quot;I wish that everyone in this room only owned and liked the church&#39;s clothing: ONLY SEXY JOCKSTRAPS.&quot; The amount of clothing in the room decreased significantly as the shirts, pants, shoes and boxers disappeared from the room. In its place were the smallest jockstraps on the market. Not a single person in this room had their ass covered and no one cared. In fact, they were all satisfied with their new life. Jockstraps were freeing, in the minds of the room. Even the genie, who originally wore a fine and well tailored suit, now simply a brilliant yellow jockstrap to match his eyes. Plus, they looked great, since everyone&#39;s erection made sure the jockstraps filled out nicely.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, originally Tyler didn&#39;t like it when his father had stated that this would be the church&#39;s uniform. The 20 year old thought that it looked very faggy. Soon, however, he was convinced that this was the closest they could get to wearing only what God had given them without attracting attention from the satanic government, so Tyler took it in stride. As he proudly walked down the aisle in nothing but a skimpy, black jockstrap that left very little to the imagination, he noticed something that he couldn&#39;t agree with. It appeared that in order to get the class to conform to the church&#39;s uniform, they ended up wearing jockstraps with school spirit, proudly displaying their college&#39;s name or logo. That would have to change. &quot;Johnathan, I wish that everyone in this room stayed in town and didn&#39;t go to college,&quot; Tyler said.<br />
<br />
This one was tough to corrupt, but the genie managed. &quot;I wish everyone in this room stayed in town and didn&#39;t go to college, JUST COLLEGE PARTIES,&quot; Tyler said. The ambitions in the room began changing since, although college memorabilia disappeared from the room, all the students of Tyler&#39;s class became party animals. They all loved to go to parties, get wasted and forget their nights. Now, prom was at a college party, as was homecoming and their graduation party. In fact, it was even Tyler&#39;s one guilty pleasure. Generally, the brunette pastor-in-training hated modern music and modern culture, but something about the beat of the music in the night, the smell of alcohol and the warmth of the bodies made him feel great. Sure, it was difficult convincing his parents to let him use the car, but once he started making fliers for the church (ones he&#39;d get rid of as soon as he left the town) it was easy to make them believe he was simply on church missions in other areas. Tyler&#39;s parents were proud of their pious, brainwashed boy and were none the wiser. Still, it&#39;d be easier if partying was allowed by church doctrine, Tyler realized. If he could manipulate reality itself, however, maybe this would be allowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Johnathan,&quot; Tyler began. &quot;I wish that partying was a totally acceptable and holy thing to do and therefore my parents loved the idea of me partying whenever I wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deciding to make things interesting, Johnathan changed the wish in an odd way. &quot;I wish that partying was a totally acceptable and holy thing FOR GAY PEOPLE to do and therefore my parents loved the idea of me partying whenever I wanted,&quot; Tyler wished.<br />
<br />
Tyler now shifted uncomfortably. The changes to the wish now made it so that Tyler&#39;s parents secretly wished their son was gay. Tyler didn&#39;t know why; his father constantly preached no tolerance of homosexuality in his teachings, but for some reason, he was enthralled with the idea of having a gay son. They even went to the point of punishing him when they had straight thoughts. When they caught him staring at a model in a bikini back when they had magazines, Tyler&#39;s father brought three dozen magazines of Playgirl and wouldn&#39;t let Tyler leave the room until he&#39;d memorized every picture in them.<br />
<br />
To some degree, Tyler wished he was gay. He truly loved partying at colleges, but his parents wouldn&#39;t let him until he came out. Many of his fellow classmates had publicly come out just so that they were allowed to go to college parties whenever they wanted. Sure, their conservative parents were horrified at the fact that their sons had chosen this &quot;lifestyle&quot; but now they wouldn&#39;t stop them from going out when they wanted. Even though most of them weren&#39;t actually gay (yet), it was the perfect excuse.<br />
<br />
Tyler had a plan to get his classmates to join his church, but now that he thought about it, there was something that could easily be taken care of first. Something that the brunette thought would make his life exponentially easier. &quot;Johnathan,&quot; Tyler declared. &quot;I wish I was gay and loved it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Johnathan simply smiled.</p>
