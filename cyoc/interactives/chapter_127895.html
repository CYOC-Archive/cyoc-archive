<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha was greatly pleased when her parents did arrive at the home she shared with Robbie. While her parents, Sidney and Brooke weren&#39;t necessarily the most active of people, that didn&#39;t mean that there wasn&#39;t any love in their family. In many ways they had worried over her and tried to help her with all the problems that her leptin deficiency had presented in life. In that her relationship with them was loving.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s good to see you,&quot; Sidney said to Martha as he and Brooke entered, &quot;You&#39;re doing okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha nodded, &quot;Robbie&#39;s role as Deputy Mayor keeps him busy... and some of the modelling shoots that I&#39;ve had have been quite fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They don&#39;t keep you too busy, do they?&quot; Brooke wondered, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want them working you till you waste away...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no fear of that, mom,&quot; Martha answered and moved to hug her mother and she did smile when that hug was returned, &quot;I&#39;m plenty strong and sleek as an Animalian. I&#39;m happy as I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, so long as you&#39;re happy,&quot; Sidney joined in the hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am... and happy that you actually wanted to join Animalia...&quot; Martha answered with a small smile on her muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it did seem interesting,&quot; Brooke commented, &quot;and it did wonders for you... far more than anything we ever could do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I am glad that we wouldn&#39;t have move out of our home,&quot; Sidney commented off hand, &quot;it&#39;s nice there... we do have some friends... and there are some good memories that we&#39;ve had there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha chuckled and shook her head slowly, &quot;Just remember... you&#39;ve agreed to go with Project Pleistocene to become a Megatherium. The Giant Ground Sloth... Supposedly it wasn&#39;t a very small animal...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sidney gave a low chuckle, &quot;Yeah... I looked it up online. Supposedly the size of an African Elephant. I think its size was the sole reason &quot;mega&quot; is in its name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might mean getting a few things that are bigger,&quot; Brook commented, &quot;but I&#39;d think we get that while we&#39;re here and before we go home...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or you could settle in Animalia,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;as if you get a double dose... you&#39;ll be physically young again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That isn&#39;t too much of a problem,&quot; Sidney commented, &quot;Neither of us are at retirement age yet... but it&#39;s not like I want to let anyone down...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha slowly nodded. While her parents could be rather sedentary when they didn&#39;t have to be active, that didn&#39;t necessarily mean they were truly lazy or opposed to doing work. Her father worked as an accountant and had been fairly good at his job and her mother helped out with a small thrift store in the town where they raised Martha. And while that was part of filling the responsibilities that related to getting things done and so on, Martha knew that her parents did them and actually did them rather well. It was after they&#39;d done the things that they had to do that they then enjoyed their leisure, and there really wasn&#39;t anything necessarily wrong with that. Her family had done fine and they did teach her respect she had grown up knowing they loved her. In the end, that was what matters.<br />
<br />
And if they wished to live in the same town where they&#39;d raised Martha rather than in Lyre or Animalia, that was fine too. There was no Edict that said Animalians could only live in Animalia. And while the present Federal government had actually attempted legislation to limit where Animalians could live, that had been one of its many great failures, and Martha figured that a lot of that sort of legislation was likely never going to pass simply for the fact that was too extreme, and as far as she could remember the people in her childhood hometown weren&#39;t like that. So, she wasn&#39;t going to push her parents to do anything they didn&#39;t want to do... Though there was the fact that she felt ready to have kits with Robbie and there was the need to figure out a way to tell her parents that before the year was out they&#39;d be grandparents.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Sidney and Brooke enjoyed a quiet afternoon with Martha and caught up on some of the details that Martha had up to and warmly greeted Robbie when he came home. From there soon came the ride to Horizon to meet with Doctor Stein who was waiting for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t expect you&#39;d be waiting for us,&quot; Sidney spoke as he looked over to Martha and Robbie who walked along beside them as made their way into the labs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... while Project Pleistocene is likely going to include a lot of testing with regard to form and function,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke, &quot;and once tissue and blood tests confirm that the Animalia Virus and the extinct animal DNA has bonded well enough that it can create a new Animalian... and essentially bring back extinct animals... it&#39;d then move into the present testing with an actual volunteer. And since you are the in laws of Animalia&#39;s deputy mayor... you could be considered rather important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This won&#39;t be dangerous... will it?&quot; Brook asked a bit nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s perfectly safe,&quot; Doctor Stein smiled, &quot;We&#39;ve made sure of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
They were eventually lead to one of the interior rooms as kind of odd. There were no windows but there looked to be a large sturdy bed in the room as well There was a mirror along the far wall as well. In many ways it didn&#39;t look like a laboratory type room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Many conversions are something we try to leave private,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke as they turned to him after looking around the room, &quot;and more often than not when we have couples converting, or the human converting is in love with an Animalian... there is generally the preference to let them have their moment together. Both you will get the injections to constitute a double dose, but you&#39;ll still be given that privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;ll be waiting outside,&quot; Martha said from beside Robbie.<br />
<br />
Both Brook and Sidney traded glances and then nodded, allowing Doctor Stein to go about his work. This included collecting the syringes while Martha and Robbie waved to them and went out the door. Doctor Stein moved up to Sidney first and gave him the warning that he might feel a pinch as he delivered the injection.  Sidney nodded and let the doctor sterilize the injection site and then deliver the injections. With that done, he then moved and did the same with Brooke. As he finished, he then smiled and stopped to collect the last of his utensils and headed out the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;And welcome to Animalia,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke as made his way out.<br />
<br />
Sidney and Brooke both followed him with their eyes until Doctor Stein had headed out and the door clicked behind him as he shut it. Though by this time Sidney actually began to feel rather warm. It was almost as if he was starting to sweat, which was odd as the room had actually felt rather normal before. It was Brooke who actually noticed, it and could see that Sidney was starting to sweat rather heavily, and as he did so, the spare tire he&#39;d had around his middle seemed to be getting smaller. Neither of them had been as overweight as Martha had been, but since they weren&#39;t the most active people when they didn&#39;t have to be active it wasn&#39;t as though they were entirely very slim people either. And soon, Brooke also felt the room seeming to grow warmer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s happening...&quot; Brooke said slowly as she watched to see brown fur starting to grow out on her husband&#39;s body. He&#39;d already seemed to have sweated out all his excess weight. In fact she thought he was starting to actually put on some muscle that looked rather nice.<br />
<br />
Sidney couldn&#39;t quite deny that. He felt incredibly warm, and while he felt excess weight sweat off, he soon had another sensation and that was one of growth. He looked down to his hands and saw that  hands were swelling larger and more robust, supported by strong thick muscles. At the tips of each finger was a growing heavy claw. It wasn&#39;t very sharp in the way that a cat&#39;s claw was, and while it had a curve to it, it wasn&#39;t as great as in a cat&#39;s claw. Instead these growing claws were long and looked more like they were for digging or grabbing things.<br />
<br />
He looked up to see that Brooke&#39;s own transformation was advancing. She&#39;d also shed off her excess weight and had a downy coat of brown fur growing across her body, but he could also see her starting to grow taller and stronger as well. Her ears were also growing and pulling into a shape that was rather like a horse&#39;s ear, but instead of being oriented on the top of her head and pointing up, her ears were on the upper sides of her head and pointed out. The biggest thing was that some of her fine age lines were disappearing, going back toward the way she was when they were younger, which made her look rather cute to Sidney.<br />
<br />
Sidney slowly approached his wife, as his feet began to feel very cramped in his shoes and that his clothing was actually starting feel rather tight on him. It created some sensation that he was growing bigger as well. However, for the moment, he couldn&#39;t quite place it as there wasn&#39;t much that was high enough to really compare himself and Brooke to.  He could see she was growing taller but that he seemed to be keeping pace with her. As Sidney reached her his tennis shoes lost their battle with his growing feet and that left him essentially barefoot as growing claws on his toes had torn through his socks just as much. He noted that Brooke almost jumped at the sound of Sidney&#39;s shoes giving way, only to have her own shoes giving way to her own clawed toes.<br />
<br />
&quot;We seem to be barefoot,&quot; Brooke said weakly and slowly as she looked to her husband, now looking very muscular. Far mar than he&#39;d ever looked before. In fact his shirt was barely holding together against his swelling chest  and shoulders.<br />
<br />
In that moment, Brooke&#39;s shirt lost its battle with her own growing body with a loud rip and feel to the floor leaving her swelling bosom free to bounce and her Amazonian physique to continue to develop At the same time, she had the feeling that her pants and panties weren&#39;t too far behind. She could feel a sort of pushing sensation on her spine and knew that what would be her tail was starting to grow.<br />
<br />
&quot;That wouldn&#39;t be the only thing that&#39;s bare,&quot; Sidney smiled as he felt his face begin to push forward. There was some heavy cracking sounds as his skull began to alter and push into a Megatherium&#39;s muzzle. It wasn&#39;t as short as the Tree Sloth&#39;s muzzle was, but the box-like muzzle was no where near as long or pointed as Martha&#39;s was as a Red Fox. Sidney briefly ran his tongue through his mouth and found what in addition to his face pushing forward into a modest box like muzzle,  but that his teeth had migrated to the sides of his mouth. Megatherium, the Giant Ground Sloth didn&#39;t actually have canines or incisors. Sidney found himself with reasonably prehensile lips to help pull food into his mouth where it would be ground by strong molars along the sides of his muzzle. <br />
<br />
However, as he continued to approach his wife, the sensation he really noticed was for the moment in his pants. Brooke looked quite good with her new muscles and large furry beasts with dark nipples poking out through her fur and that couldn&#39;t help but draw him to her. He reached her and brought her into a warm hug and began to warmly kiss her cheeks as Brooke&#39;s own face pushed forward into a Megatherium&#39;s muzzle. The kiss eventually became rather passionate as Sidney&#39;s shirt and pants lost their battle with his growing muscle and tail and as Brooke&#39;s own growing tail finished off her underwear and began to push her pants down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s a bit frisky,&quot; Brooke managed to come up for air while Sidney began to kiss at her neck as well and then looked down to see a massive erect penis standing at attention between her husband&#39;s robust muscular legs. It was huge when compared to what it&#39;d been before. &quot;Someone&#39;s very frisky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t help it,&quot; Sidney managed, &quot;everything feels so good... you&#39;re so beautiful... I... want... you... my... love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brooke smiled and reached down with her clawed hands to where her pants were straining against her muscular legs. While her claws were long and blunt, she was able to fit them in between the fabric of her pants and her furry legs. Once she had a firm grip on the fabric, she gave a hard pull, literally pulling the fabric apart and leaving her as nude as her husband and also with a powerful growing feeling of arousal. She dropped the torn pants to the floor and took her husband&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you too, my love,&quot; Brooke smiled to him, &quot;just remember... be gentle.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then carefully climbed onto the bed. It groaned slightly as rolled onto a side to let Sidney have a full look at her, but there was no great problem as he soon joined her on the bed. He gave her a warm kiss and then trailed kisses down her neck and to her breasts. As his lips met her engorged nipples, Sidney was soon rewarded with warm Megatherium milk. It tasted a bit different, but it was fine enough and an aroused moan from Brooke was enough to push him forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will always be gentle,&quot; Sidney told her and then slowly eased his erect penis into his wife&#39;s waiting and wet vagina. And from there the two built a slow and steady rhythm together.<br />
<br />
&quot;And slow and steady,&quot; Brooke urged, before moaning, &quot;that will let it last longer and make the climax bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Sidney smiled back.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Outside the room, Robbie and Martha waited quietly. Horizon had made sure the rooms they used for conversions were soundproofed to make sure that any &quot;romantic&quot; activity that went on inside those rooms wasn&#39;t overheard by anyone in the hallways. Not even the two Red Fox Animalians with their triangular ears could hear what was going on inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope they&#39;ll be happy,&quot; Robbie said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they will,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;as apparently becoming an Animalian was something that they wanted to do. Working up the energy for it was just something they would have to reach at their own pace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you figured any idea on how to tell them our plans for when you come into heat in the spring?&quot; Robbie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still not sure... I don&#39;t want to overshadow their conversion with news of our plans,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;but I don&#39;t think we should wait until I&#39;m ready to give birth either...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... they may have some acclimation classes to go through and gather things they&#39;ll need to take back home with them,&quot; Robbie commented, &quot;perhaps it could come up then... or maybe announce after we&#39;re sure you&#39;re pregnant. By then they&#39;ll be used to being Animalians... and your announcement won&#39;t overshadow their joining Animalia. Either way... we have the time to talk about it and plan it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha smiled and nuzzled her muzzle to Robbie&#39;s, &quot;that we do.&quot;</p>
