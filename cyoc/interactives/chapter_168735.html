<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John thought with his powers he should try cleaning and tuning up his car to just the way he liked it. Walking out to the drive way was his blue Toyota that his parents had bought him for his 16th birthday when he got his license... Under the condition that it&#39;d be shared with Kim when she got her license, but even when she got her license with the amount of care he put into the Toyota it was closer to his car he lends to Kim. He summoned a bucket of water, soap, sponge, etc. as he looked at his car which was looking dusty. Then he looked inside... and Kim didn&#39;t take care of her trash... <br />
John opened the car and muttered under her breath &quot;She really needs to take better care of Michelle&quot; as he smelled fast food. He grabbed a rag and glared at each piece of trash which burned away to ashes and then the ashes burned away to literal nothingness. While he was at it He went to empty the glove compartment of whatever junk was left in it... and now time for under the seats. John willed his hands to flatten and stretch as he laid them on the floor of his car. It felt satisfying just grabbing and collecting all the junk and change he couldn&#39;t reach before. Setting the change aside he brought his hands together and crushed all the junk with the force of his power and created a perfectly cut diamond on a chain and put it on the rear view mirror. A little more liberal usage of his power to freshen up the air and John exited his car. Now all that&#39;ll be left is to wash Michelle and she&#39;ll be sparkling. <br />
Thinking about his car and how he once imagined it&#39;d be used as a girl magnet... he sighed and wished &quot;Wish I had a girlfriend right Michelle?&quot; Then suddenly the car started to groan as the metals and plastic seemed to contract and bend. John was panicking until the material seemed to shift as the paint and coating started turning into cloth, and the headlights seemed to be turning into eyes. Once the metal, glass, and plastic turned to flesh the groaning quieted. A second later lying on her belly was a woman with black boots, black gloves, a red dress, and a lovely figure. Looking at her features she looked kinda Asian, but honestly she was probably mixed race. Asian car made in America maybe?<br />
The new woman sat up by herself and opened and closed her hands experimentally then she looked at John and said &quot;I&#39;m alive!&quot;. The car woman got up and ran to embrace John in a hug. &quot;Your wish came true!&quot;<br />
John was thrown for a loop and said &quot;Yeah... Were you conscious?&quot;<br />
&quot;Kind of?... It was a weird not existing and then existing the whole time.&quot; the two stopped hugging, but Michelle still held his hand. <br />
John took a breath a little flustered at this gorgeous woman&#39;s closeness to him and said &quot;Well then I may have cleaned up your insides but... We still need to clean you although...&quot; he looked to the bucket and sponge and dismissed those creations of his, and led his once car inside. Michelle found it interesting taking off her boots herself, but John&#39;s mother and Kim were doing some home schooling and both noticed John just brought in a pretty woman covered in dust and dirt. <br />
<br />
His mother asked &quot;Who is this and why is she so dirty?&quot; John deciding the omnipotence part would be annoying to explain and just willed his mother to know he was omnipotent. <br />
After that he said &quot;So I made a wish that Michelle here would become a woman and here she is. I figured it would save some money to have her was up in the tub instead of using more water on a much bigger car.&quot; <br />
his mom got up and said &quot;I&#39;ll go get some clothes for her. She can&#39;t wear those dirty things after she gets clean. You can clean yourself fright Michelle was it?&quot; <br />
Michelle said &quot;I haven&#39;t done it before, but I&#39;d like John to do it. He&#39;s always washed my body before.&quot; <br />
Mom said &quot;No, you are a woman and he&#39;s a man and doing that like this is-&quot; then her mind changed a bit and said &quot;Should be fine, he&#39;s owned you and taken care of you before after all.&quot; <br />
Kim said &quot;Can&#39;t I wash her instead?&quot;<br />
Michelle glared at Kim and asked &quot;Where do you think all the scratches on me and my dress came from? You left your trash in me, and I won&#39;t let you clean me.&quot; and then she stuck her tongue out for a moment. <br />
<br />
John was glad that with just a little flex of his power he could wash Michelle. As the bath tub filled with warm water the car girl took her dress off in front of him like it was nothing and he got to see her true nudity as she didn&#39;t even have any underwear on underneath. Michelle just smiled and asked &quot;So I just get in?&quot; John nodded leading to Michelle lowering herself in. John had to do it all from wetting, lathering, and rinsing her hair... To scrubbing every square inch which she happily presented to him. From her bare back, to her C-cup breasts which she told him to go back and scrub everywhere when he just glossed over the top. leading to him playing with her breasts some more and really getting into the underside of her tits. When presented with her rear the butt itself was simple enough to clean, but his front tail was getting more and more stiff as he got more and more into her thighs and even more private regions. <br />
<br />
After the scrubbing he let Michelle soak for a bit while he tried to calm himself down... Should he try another way to calm himself?</p>
