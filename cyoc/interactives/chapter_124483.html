<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Lemme hold &#39;er,&quot; Amy said. &quot;I wanna play mamma for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim cringed as she reached for him. She lifted him up high above her, and Jim shrieked, fearing she would accidentally drop him in her drunken stupor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Iz okay, sweetie,&quot; she said as she lowered him to her massive tits. He lay on them like a pair of fleshy bean bags. &quot;Mamma has you.&quot; He was paralyzed between feeling frightened and turned on by the situation. Amy seemed to stagger a bit, and she reeked of alcohol. Jim looked to Judy for help. She frowned, and Jim noticed a faint hint of concern on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Judy said. &quot;I think maybe it&#39;s time for Jamie to go to bed with Ellen.&quot; Jim breathed a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw,&quot; moaned Cathy. &quot;But, I wanna to play with him too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Judy said. &quot;Bedtime for baby.&quot; She gently lifted Jim away from Amy and cradled him as she carried him up to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jim whispered to her as she laid him on the bed next to Ellen, who was sleeping soundly still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Judy said. &quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt you. Amy looked a bit too... um, out of it... to be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jim said. He looked up at Judy with concern. She looked a bit &quot;out of it&quot; herself, and she still held the balloon. He had a feeling that something bad was bound to happen later. If only there was some way to get the girls to stop... &quot;Judy,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe we should all just go to bed now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, it&#39;s been a long day,&quot; he explained. &quot;And, you&#39;ve had some fun already.&quot; This might be his chance, he realized. If the girls went to sleep, then he might be able to get the balloon back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; Judy said. &quot;We&#39;re grown up chicks ready to party all night, not babies like widdle you.&quot; She gently poked him on his button nose.<br />
<br />
Jim frowned. It seemed that there was no stopping them. There was still one other thing he might ask for, though. &quot;Well, alright then,&quot; he said. &quot;You girls have your fun. But, before you go...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve been really good during the party. Right? Don&#39;t you think so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said, feeling curious now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could I get a little reward for that? Please?&quot; He really hoped that this might work.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot; she asked, giving him a suspicious look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you please grow... It... back to normal?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Judy looked confused for a moment, and then said, &quot;Oh... &#39;It&#39;... I see.&quot; She thought a moment. &quot;Well, I guess so. Like you said, you&#39;ve been good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you!&quot; Jim said.<br />
<br />
Judy reached down to undo the straps of his diaper. &quot;&#39;scuse me,&quot; she said. &quot;I need to get a look at it to make sure I get it right.&quot; Then, Jim&#39;s bare flat crotch was visible again. Judy said, &quot;Control Jimmy&#39;s thing size.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim hoped that would work for the spell. Judy lifted the balloon to her lips and blew. FFFOOOFFF. To his relief, it began to grow back, the whole thing. She blew again. FFOOOOFFF. It grew even bigger. They both looked at it quizzically. Was that big enough? they wondered silently, both feeling faintly embarrassed by the situation now. Judy blew again. FFFFOOOOOOOFFFF.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; she said. &quot;Does that look right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim stared silently.<br />
<br />
It was big.<br />
<br />
It was very big.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,&quot; Jim said, stalling for time. Although it was hard to tell what the right size would be for a toddler his age, he could be fairly certain that this size was a bit too large. It might have been even twice as large as it should be. For a millisecond he debated if he should correct her mistake. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he said at last, as any man would. &quot;That looks right to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Judy said. &quot;Release.&quot; The balloon deflated, but he did not. Then, Judy folded the diaper up onto him again. It was a noticeably tighter fit now. &quot;Now,&quot; she said. &quot;You got your reward. Go to sleep, and let us party... or else.&quot; She gave him a bit of a stern look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it,&quot; he said. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
He lay down on his back and closed his eyes. He was surprised to feel a kiss on his forehead. He opened his eyes to see Judy smiling down at him, benevolently. It was surprisingly comforting. He smiled back, then closed his eyes again.<br />
<br />
He heard a light switch flip and listed to her walk away. When he heard her on the stairs, his eyes opened again. The room was dark even though the sun had just set. Nighttime was coming on fast, and he felt his toddler body getting a bit tired. Of course, there was no way he could sleep now. He needed to stay awake. If he could outlast the girls, he could get the balloon back. It was his only chance. He carefully slid off the bed and toddled over to the stairs as quietly as a cat. Then, he sat on the top step to wait and listen for the right moment. After a minute, his eyelids drooped a little, and his head bobbed once. He shook his head and slapped his cheeks a few times. It would be a fight to stay focused and awake, he realized. He just hoped the girls would pass out before he did.<br />
<br />
As he watched, a car&#39;s headlight beams swept through the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot; Judy asked. &quot;Is that your parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Amy said.</p>
