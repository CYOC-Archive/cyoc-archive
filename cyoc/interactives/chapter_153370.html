<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were still frozen in fear by the nearest grey but youfelt a little easier on the matter of trust but they could be attempting to trick you into trusting them. They had the decency to not watch you too intently while you were butt nakedearlier, the matter of being without clothes could have been a biproduct of their abduction method but you were unsure about the matter as you were no Grey yourself.<br />
<br />
The Grey that had approached you awhileago had explained that they needed a subject to test a serum of theirs that only reacted to certain genetic patterns, but the pattern was closely human so they had to abduct a single human with the correct genes for their serum to work. Worriedly though, they had only a rough idea of what it woulddo to you, then he, or it since you didn&#39;t know whether itwasamale or female, went on to babble about mental capabilities and mind-links.<br />
<br />
You were a little suspicious, but you had craved something interesting to happen in your life andwho knows, what if this serum spices up your life to an acceptable quantity, it might even remove the concept of boring from your life for a great while. <br />
<br />
Some of the other greys had gotten closer and began inspecting your body, but they never did something which made you jump, they just strokedsome partsof your suited body and lightly prodded here and there, wordlessly inspecting as if they all knew what the others were doing.<br />
<br />
You felt slightly uncomfortable but it wasn&#39;t surprising for you, you silently gulped. &#39;&#39;Well...I guess it wouldn&#39;t hurt... I would like it to be painless though.&#39;&#39; You carefully worded, slightly worried of different possibilities which came to mind. The largest Grey formed a small smile as it turned to the Grey which had gone to inspect you first and lightly nodded.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;We can&#39;t guarantee no pain... But, the injection will be... Painless.&#39;&#39; The Grey slowly worded with a calming smile. Then the Greys all guided you down a corridor that had just opened to a much larger cylindrical room with a kind of odd cylindrical chamber in the centre, covered in whizzing, whirring, and buzzing machinery that you couldn&#39;t make sense out of, looking around you suddenly realized that most of the Greys that had escorted youto this room were gone.<br />
<br />
There was now only three Greys that you could see nearby, one of them were the one who asked you for permission to test this serum on you while the one that had gone off to one of the machines were the one that seemingly commanded the other Greys.<br />
<br />
The third Grey was one of those that had inspected you and were now gone off to another set of odd machines. The first Grey guided you to the boss Grey who had found a large Odd looking syringe with a odd white substance inside itself, the boss Grey beckoned you closer, you didn&#39;t exactly know what else to do but the syringe needle looked a bit discomforting, quite long and thin.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;We&#39;d rather not damage the suit... And due to the nature of the serums liquid form, it has to be injected into your main artery for your head...&#39;&#39; The senior Grey explained to you as the boss made a small drop of the white liquid come out the tip of the syringe. You silently gulped as you once again realized the only part of your body not covered by the suit was your head and upper neck.<br />
<br />
The boss prodded your upper neck, just above the suit collar, the senior grey helped you rest your head on your shoulder so the boss would have maximum vision of the place he prodded you. The boss came closer with the syringe, resting the tip just above the place he previously prodded you. &#39;&#39;Ready...&#39;&#39; The boss slowly creaked,you figured he wanted toknow if you were sure about this, gulping you nervously open your mouth. &#39;&#39;R-ready...&#39;&#39; You worded, careful not to scratch your neck onthe razor sharp tip of the syringe.<br />
<br />
Gritting your teeth and closing your eyes you awaited the sharp pinch of the syringe lodging itself into your flesh...<br />
<br />
But what actually followed was the shivering tickle of the syringe carefully sliding into your flesh, cold metal met varm human flesh and blood as it reached down towards it&#39;s intended target artery.<br />
<br />
Then it reached it&#39;s goal as the end of the syringe met your neck and the tip of the syringe was peeking inside your artery, it felt shiveringly... Odd, it wasn&#39;t painful, just wierd feeling. You stop gritting your teeth as you find yourself almost out of air, then the boss presses something on the syringe, and you feel a wave of drowsiness stream throughout your body as the serum enters your artery and your fingers twitch slightly.<br />
<br />
one of your arms jolt abruptly as some of your muscles convulse and strain, The boss slowly take out the syringe from your neck and toss it ontop a nearby small metallic tray and grab ahold of your body as you gasp for air and began eraticly twitching and jolting, unable to pass out as the serum reaches your brain and then spread to other pieces of your body, causing muscles to randomly stretch, contract, convulse or not do anything.<br />
<br />
The senior Gray join the Boss as he catches you before your legs give way and begin eraticly twitching and moving.<br />
Then your body suddenly calms down as the serum adapts and begins affecting your body from the inside and out, the two Grays lift you onto a dull grey table and begin inspecting your body, looking for potential damage, signs of internal damage and signs of life and consciousness.<br />
<br />
Your eyes are wide open and laid back, blood vessels thickening and arteries going ubercharge together with your heart. Mouth agape as you rasping and steadily breath, your mind racing in self induced turmoil, you were currently experiencing the worst headache in the history of headaches, it was like you entire body was splitting only entirely localized to your head, the boss rushed back to the machines and brought out another syringe, this time smaller and with a different serum, the boss injected the syringe into the same place he had injected the larger artery syringe, amazingly enough, your blood had immediately sealed up the small tendril wound that the large syringe had left.<br />
<br />
As the boss injected the syringe, your head lessened in pain but a dull numbness stretched across your body, the mighty headache was still present but thankfully severely lessened. &#39;&#39;Oooww...M-m-my... B-b-b-bod-dy... Pa-a-aiin-n... Owww...&#39;&#39; You attempted to talk but barely managed to utter a word without stuttering severely, you also barely managed to see. &#39;&#39;Ssshhh... Rest... calmly...&#39;&#39; The senior Gray worriedly muttered back looking at the boss who was messing around with the machines.<br />
<br />
Then the central  cylinder in the room loudly swooshed open, the boss looked back to the Senior gray and nodded towards the chamber, the Senior nodded in return. &#39;&#39;Human... We will need to... suspend you in a bio-tank, to heal you and keep you unconscious until the serum has stopped largely affecting your body.&#39;&#39; The senior hurriedly explained as he closed your eyelids and lifted you up.<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;O-o-k...&#39;&#39; You harshly coughed, doing anything at all made your mind and body hurt, you didn&#39;t have time to brew up idea&#39;s for what might happen to you, you didn&#39;t want to terrify yourself, panic wouldn&#39;t help anyone in this situation... It hurt... your uncovered skin felt burning hot, your skin colour going tomato red in unbearable heat.<br />
<br />
Then you felt something roughly clamp around your arms and lift you up. &#39;&#39;Don&#39;t resist the cables...&#39;&#39; Was the last you heard from the Gray senior, a metallic swoosh and hard clanging left you alone and isolated in a dull gray, two lines of neon green illuminated the chamber.<br />
<br />
You wanted to ponder what the Senior meant with &#39;don&#39;t resist the cables&#39;, but even thinking had become painful for you as you helplessly hang suspended by two metal clamps. Then a bit of metallic swishing became audible from over and below you. You painfully opened your one eye to see... Metal tentacles? moving cables? were these what the senior warned you not to resist? <br />
<br />
Then one of the cables from above with what looked like a black breathing mask attached itself to your mouth, then, The cable that brought the mask slid through it and down your throat, additional cables attaches themselves to the mask and forced themselves down your throught, stopping in your lungs and stomach, supplying you with a steady supply of air and sucking out leftover co2.<br />
<br />
Then another cable brought down a helmet and sat it on your head, it&#39;s lower part merging with your suit, sealing your body from outside particles, the helmet covered your eyes, covering your final senses with isolation from the outside. Then you felt the other cables attach themselves to your suit, presumably supplying your skin and rest of your body with nesessary particles to keep healthy, then the feeling of liquid hit your legs as a thick sludge like substance covered your covered body, then a wave of nausea hit your body as your ears picked up a faint hissing sound...<br />
<br />
Then you fell into calm, painless uncounsciousness as you fell into limbo, a black void envelopping you as your body changed...</p>
