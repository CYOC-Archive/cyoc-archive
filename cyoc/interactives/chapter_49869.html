<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The shadows ate in silence, actually eating cooked food and some veggies, three of them <br />
now having longer hair than before, they ate in the kitchen, standing up. <br />
<br />
Jack and Marcine meanwhile had also been called to dinner by Beatrice. Jensen gave the <br />
order that Jack and Marcine even when fully changed were not to be fed on, only their herd <br />
and fawns.<br />
<br />
 Jack and Mercine were now just under twenty-three percent deer. Jack had antlers <br />
emerging from his head like tiny bonsai trees, and both how much larger ears than before. <br />
They still had working hands even if their finger nails had turned black.  Jack and Marcine <br />
while grateful for the being freed of the stress of modern living as the Transform insured <br />
they would, they were also beginning to feel slightly uncomfortable around the wolf pack <br />
and huddled closer together in the kitchen as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;There are so many of them now dear.&quot; Marcine said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes there are dear.&quot; Jack replied, &quot;I count thirty one.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thirty-one? How much larger will their numbers get-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, but if our herd will survive, we had better make sure to have as many fawns <br />
as possible.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. I can assure you that won't be a problem... I also just realized, we're the only people <br />
here with clothes on.&quot; Marcine said, not including the shadows as people. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll keep them on as long as possible dear. We'll have plenty of time to be naked after <br />
tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I wouldn't have it any other  way...&quot; Marcine leaned against him, &quot;I'm not having any <br />
of those wolves get a look at you or me until we're compatible with only each other...&quot; <br />
<br />
In the main dinning room Jenny tore off a piece of flesh and tore it to smaller pieces as it <br />
went down her throat, not finding the taste or texture at all offending. <br />
<br />
Jenny said though none of her siblings or pack mates paid her mind, &quot;You know, <br />
technically speaking, wild animals are supposed to enjoy cooked meat as much as humans, <br />
thus why they raid camp sites... &quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, the logical culprit was that Game itself, after all, the Big Bad Wolf HAD <br />
technically eaten his prey raw when he swallowed them whole. <br />
<br />
Kaylee eyed the dead rabbit in Kevin's paws. She wasn't sure how much she liked the idea <br />
of her pups eating rabbit that was wild, Marcine and Jack's herd than to their transform <br />
would be paragons of health and be devoid of diseases and parasites, the rabbit the pups <br />
had captured was not exempt from this. <br />
<br />
&quot;You.&quot; She snapped her fingers at a random she-wolf, &quot;Pearl, get that rabbit skinned and <br />
cooked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At once Alpha Female!&quot; The pearl colored she wolf bowed ran right past Kevin, grabbed <br />
the carcass just as Kevin's jaws snapped down, and went into the kitchen and began <br />
tearing the skin off the rabbit with her claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee looked her youngest son with a stern face, &quot;I won't have you catching internal <br />
parasites because you ate a rabbit that wasn't proper game.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... Yes Mommy.&quot; Kevin bowed. <br />
<br />
Kaylee looked around the dinning room, the majority of the painting had been removed to <br />
be sold, the pictures of human beings clothed or otherwise just didn't feel aesthetically <br />
appealing as they once had. The pack tearing into the two slabs of meat with abandon. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want the entire house's renovations finish by tomorrow.&quot; Kaylee said simply looked at <br />
one of the she-wolves, who nearly choked.  The rest of the pack looked rather daunted by <br />
the goal as well. None of them would be getting much sleep it seemed. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're working as fast we can...&quot; Lamented the teal wolfen, Sandi, &quot;There's only twenty-<br />
one of us.&quot; She without irony or sarcasm. <br />
<br />
&quot;You.&quot; Kaylee looked at the dark blue she-wolf next to Sandi, &quot;What is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
She swallowed what she was eating and said, &quot;I'm Caroline Alpha Female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not Coraline?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Alpha Female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Caroline. You're now forewolf of this project after me and the twins, you're to make sure <br />
everything happens on schedule and no one is taking leisure time when they're supposed <br />
to be on task. Make sure your own job gets done on task, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Somewhat overwhelmed at the random selection, Caroline started for a moment before <br />
bowing, &quot;Yes Alpha Female, I'll do my best to make sure everyone else does.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caroline didn't like the feeling of all her pack mates' eyes on her, but at least everyone <br />
went back to stuff their faces soon enough. <br />
<br />
&quot;So I'm sayin'.&quot; Said Nick sitting indian style next to Lawrence, Roger, and Ulysses, &quot;That we <br />
oughta establish a chain of command, we are wolves after all, and seein' how I'm the <br />
manliest man here, I nominate myself for Beta Male.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran's ears perked at this and she turned to Nick and said putting an arm around her <br />
sister's hip, &quot;Sorry, the position of Beta is filled.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?! By who?&quot; Nick asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;By us.&quot; The twins said. <br />
<br />
&quot;HUH?! That's cheating! You can't both be Alpha Female!&quot; Nick whined.<br />
<br />
The twins frowned at this lack of respect, &quot;Never the less, the position is reserved.&quot; Fran <br />
said. 'Since I haven't decided yet weather I should make Julie I and my sister's triplet so <br />
our daughters can be fathered by the Master or have her become our Beta Male.'  Of <br />
course Darla thought the same thing and backed up her twin on this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! I'm Beta-Male!&quot; Bart declared standing up. <br />
<br />
Every last one of the pack members looked at Bart oddly.<br />
<br />
Bart returned their odd looks, &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister,&quot; Fran said to shift the pack discussion away from the train wreck it was headed <br />
for, &quot;Why don't you dine with your daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daughter?&quot; Darla said with some surprised. <br />
<br />
Fran whispered in her ear, &quot;Yes, it seems of the two of us, Alice considers you to be her <br />
mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah sister.&quot; Darla nodded. &quot;Don't worry sister, I'm sure we can ask Master about bringing <br />
Julie and the girls into the pack in one shape or another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;thank you sister.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice had been standing back from the cubs, merely politely observing it all and taking <br />
note. When Darla came over to Alice from Darla's spot next to Fran and Kaylee she leaned <br />
down to the glass pup and asked, &quot;Would you care to eat with me in private Alice dear?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If you would so like dear mother.&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla did her best not to stiffen at the identification. After all, if Bart and the others were <br />
the cubs of Jesen and Kaylee, would could not Alice be the pup of Jensen and Darla? While <br />
like the others Darla had been hoping to experience the entire process before coming to <br />
the final product (beached whale state then dirty diapers and all), she had no intention of <br />
denying the word Alice had just spoken to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I'd so like Alice.&quot; The taller blond she wolf said she easily tore a big mass of the red <br />
meat off and took Alice's dainty hand. &quot;Lead the way.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You will also be my first guest within mother! Oh please come!&quot;  Alice pulled at the much <br />
larger Darla as Alice's other paw touched the surface of a mirror set at one end of the <br />
dinning room (Jensen had given precise instructions that none of the mirrors in the house <br />
were to be removed). Alice went through like she was liquid mercury falling sideways into <br />
a beaker of the stuff and pulled Darla in with her. <br />
<br />
The other side wasn't a oddly colored void filled with floating mirrors showing the real <br />
world like Darla had expected. It was like there was giant flood light sorts spreading out <br />
from the mirror pane, but it wasn't precisely light, spreading outward from the mirror <br />
pane was .... Darla wasn't sure how to describe it.  It was this reality lost it's consistency <br />
once it was out of any view someone could get looking into the mirror.  Beyond the view of <br />
the mirror, the house looked like a bunch of people had only just begun moving in with <br />
boxes and items dated from several decades back, and then there were parts that didn't <br />
complex with the shape and size of the house at all. The parts that did look like the house <br />
had once been beyond the view of the mirror gave the impression someone had take a <br />
wall sized paint bushed and swept it by leaving behind a trail of reality. <br />
<br />
Of course everything in view of the mirror was reversed writing and all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice...&quot; Darla looked, and in front of her was a flesh and blood blond she wolf in a blue <br />
and white dress. <br />
<br />
&quot;That dress is very becoming of you mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dress?&quot; Darla looked and gasped, she was wearing a red and purple satin dress <br />
customized for her tail that was right out of the victorian era. Otherwise she was <br />
unchanged.  She looked Alice, &quot;But how? I thought those who were already part of the <br />
pack didn't change when you took them into the mirror!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's a special exception for you, because you're my mother!&quot; Alice nodded.<br />
<br />
Darla thought of something and asked, &quot;Uh Alice dear, can we take a look outside the <br />
pane for the moment, I wish to check something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you wish to check?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just... to see if the dress comes with me.&quot; Honestly she was worried about becoming glass <br />
in the real world like her daughter but Alice took her hand without further question <br />
playing along with her mother's transparent pretend and pulled her out slightly of the <br />
mirror. <br />
<br />
Darla was revealed when the dress's sleeve vanished and stick her head out saw a flesh <br />
and blood paw next to Alice's glass one. Reeling it in, Alice sat down on one of the chairs <br />
that existed just outside the view of the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...&quot; Darla said, &quot;Alice if this is a reflection then where are...&quot; Darla looked around, and <br />
finally noticed the transparent images of Master, and her pack mates feasting down on a <br />
reflection of the meat strip. Darla put her hand through one testing and wasn't surprised <br />
indeed when her hand passed through the reflection of Fran like a ghost. She saw the <br />
reflections of her packmates vanish as they left the view of the mirror pane like cards in a <br />
slideshow.  <br />
<br />
Alice calmly began tearing the meat into strips sitting in a chair having the slab of meat on <br />
a table. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice,&quot; Darla asked her apparent child, &quot;Can you bring things from this world into the real <br />
world?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice shock her head, her blond locks tossed this way and that. Adam hadn't had those <br />
while he transformed in the real world, nor did Alice have them as a glass pup, but in the <br />
world within mirrors, Alice took after her apparent mother.  &quot;No. They either vanish when I <br />
take them, turn to fine glass powder, or simply refuse to budge like the mirror pane is a <br />
solid wall. They seem to very much prefer being here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla wondered, did Alice's soul now exist within the glass of mirrors, and her spirit <br />
simply put on a skin tight diving suit whenever she ventured out into reality? Would this <br />
mean this was purely Alice's soul she was interacting with now? <br />
<br />
The dressing not feeling quite as hot or itchy as it should have, Darla saw down out of <br />
view into the opposing chair to Alice's. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice, how do you go from mirror frame to mirror frame so fast? This place seems as big <br />
as the real universe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice spoke after she took off a piece of meat, chewed and swallowed, not eating with her <br />
mouth full in the least (which would have been unladylike). &quot;I take three steps to where I <br />
want to go, and I'm there, nothing else to it.&quot; Alice held up her fingers her emphasis, &quot;One, <br />
two, three.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm pretty sure that's Wizard of Oz, not Through The Looking Glass.&quot; Darla said to her <br />
child. <br />
<br />
Alice offered some tea she had set aside but Darla politely declined. She didn't want to risk <br />
liquid glass forming in her belly when she left the mirror. <br />
<br />
&quot;So this is your private world.&quot; Darla said looking around at the reflect of things that were <br />
currently seen by the mirrors, echoes of things once seen by mirrors, and the pretending <br />
of things never seen by the mirrors. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, since I haven't been able to create any new friends, I'm going to name the first one <br />
Dinah, and the ones after that Snowdrop and Kitty if they'll have them.&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla thought for a moment, &quot;Those are the names of Alice's cat and her cat's kittens in <br />
Lewis Carol's book.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice nodded excited as her mother ate away at another strip of flesh, &quot;Oh yes indeed <br />
mother! I think it would be fabulous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You certainly are embracing the whole Wonderland feel Alice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is how I was born mother if not in words of the Transform then at least in Spirit. I had <br />
nothing as Adam, no goals, no plans, no ambition, now I have so much more...&quot;  Alice then <br />
came around the table and began nuzzling her mother's hand, Darla began patting Alice's <br />
blond locks of hair. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya mule! Ya ya!&quot; Shouted Nicole as she punched and kicked holes into the wall into <br />
strategic places. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya ya.&quot; Nick sighed next to her falling slightly behind. <br />
<br />
The wolves had been given fifteen minutes to digest their lunch, then it was back to work <br />
double time! Thankfully Caroline had found one of her new packmates had been a <br />
plumber's assistant once, and Kaylee observed any wiring herself personally having a <br />
fundamental understanding of wiring and electronics, thus they hadn't accidently flooded <br />
the house or set it on fire from the increased pace of the work. <br />
<br />
Kevin had downed his rabbit in a series of nasty bites once Kaylee was certain it was <br />
devoid of any unwanted pathogens. Sadly, with the work going full blast, the wolf cubs <br />
were barred from being anywhere but the backyard or their room. <br />
<br />
All except one. <br />
<br />
The full length mirror was set up in the office by Anne and Alexandra who quickly left the <br />
alphas to do their business. The shadows were dismissed from the office as well. <br />
<br />
Kaylee and Jensen flanked Jenny on either side as she made the call, the voice modulator <br />
having arrived via overnight delivery that afternoon. Darla and Fran huddled around Alice <br />
as Darla repeated, &quot;So Alice, you know precisely where you need to go right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice nodded, &quot;Yes Mother Dear, three steps to where you told me, one, two, three.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And make sure a mirror is there.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mother dear.&quot; Alice stepped into the full length mirror taken from one of the dressing <br />
rooms becoming her transparent victorian era self on the other side. She made one final <br />
wave at her mother and walked out of view. <br />
<br />
Kevin, Bart, and Marcy sat down cross legged on the floor somewhat bored at not having a <br />
real party to play. <br />
<br />
About a minute of total boredom later Alice came back into frame and said, &quot;Yes, I saw <br />
who you showed me a picture of, they have a mirror now in their office.&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla rubbed her glass head, &quot;Thank you Alice. Go hurry back, if nothing happened after <br />
their next couple of phone calls, come back, otherwise, brings them back here through the <br />
mirror.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mother.&quot; Alice mime curtsied came back the way she came. <br />
<br />
Jenny sat on top of the desk and punched in the number she had been waiting to call since <br />
this entire plan got underway. <br />
<br />
Jensen and Kaylee were both eager to see how this went. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's Jennifer. Yes, hello, yes it's me.&quot; She spoke through the voice modulator. &quot;My voice <br />
sounds a little strange? It's just a bit of a cold I and my husband have. Yes it has been a <br />
while since we called I know. No we didn't just dump you there to rot. At any rate, I really <br />
have a question I need ask you..... Transform or Dare?&quot;</p>
