<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff smiled contently as he watched the football game with his boyfriend. Something about that had a bit of an odd ring to it, but he couldn&#39;t quite place what it was. He knew that Finn was only supposed to be gay but seeing him as a boyfriend felt a bit off. Not that he was complaining. It was just unexpected. The more he thought about Finn, the more memories of them being together started to fill his mind. No longer was Finn joking about being gay, rather he was waiting until after all the other guys had left and the locker room was for him and Jeff alone. <br />
<br />
But then there was the added effect of his father. Mike and Dave had always been close. But this was too close. Dave seemed to keep leaning into Mike&#39;s arm, just like how Finn was leaning into his. He shook his head. Of course Dave was. The two had been having &#39;secret&#39; relationships for the last decade or so. At least that was the first time Jeff really realized what Mike and Dave really meant by Dave being a &#39;wide receiver&#39; back in college. <br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Finn asked as he nuzzled deeper into Jeff&#39;s grasp. The game was getting close to finishing, and it looked like Mike and Dave were snuggling up for another round as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, no,&quot; Jeff lied. &quot;Just a bit of a headache.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s just because we haven&#39;t had dinner yet,&quot; Finn offered. His eyes looked over at the two older men. Mike&#39;s hands were moving up and down Dave&#39;s furry body. He seemed to love focusing on the other man&#39;s belly, but it was rapidly moving closer and closer to his pants. &quot;You want to go out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff leaned in for a kiss to Finn&#39;s forehead. &quot;Yeah... Let&#39;s.&quot; He got up and grabbed a light jacket. &quot;We&#39;ll be back later,&quot; he told his dad. &quot;You want me to pick anything up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike jumped up for a second. It was the first time he wasn&#39;t touching Dave since the shift. &quot;Hey,&quot; he pulled Jeff away and started whispering. &quot;The only thing you changed was Dave being a ram. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded. &quot;Yeah. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No reason,&quot; Mike cleared his throat. &quot;You two have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two left their fathers, only to hear oldies rock music kick on as the door closed. Jeff went down the sidewalk and saw his tiger striped Jeep waiting for him at the end of the driveway. Any other version of him would have thought it was tacky or lame, but with his confident swagger nearly everyone who knew him wanted to get a ride. Finn climbed into the passenger seat and the two were off to one of those American Era type restaurants that had mass produced memorabilia. The food was never too good, but there was at least a bit of a selection and some alcohol. <br />
<br />
They entered the restaurant and people naturally stared. Seeing two massive guys like them together always seemed to draw at least a bit of attention. The hostess took them to a tall table near the bar. &quot;Do you two need anything to get started?&quot; her hand naturally landed on Jeff&#39;s shoulder and lingered. &quot;Something to drink? Apps? Anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we&#39;re alright for now,&quot; Jeff answered.<br />
<br />
She almost had a bit of a huff, but kept her smile. &quot;Alright. If you need anything, just let me know,&quot; her finger naturally dripped down Jeff&#39;s muscular arm. &quot;I do mean anything...&quot; whispering next to him as she left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t take you anywhere,&quot; Finn smirked. A couple of soft bleats of a laugh quickly followed as he looked over the menu.<br />
<br />
Jeff mocked him by shaking his head and sneering. &quot;Not like I&#39;m looking for it...&quot; It only drew another bit of laughter from the ram. Both of them knew Jeff enjoyed the attention. Even if he didn&#39;t want to have sex with someone like the hostess, that didn&#39;t mean he didn&#39;t like people noticing his body. He continued to look over the menu, pretty sure he already knew what he wanted. &quot;Hey,&quot; Jeff asked. &quot;What would you do if you had a device that could change people and no one would notice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Change people?&quot; Finn asked. &quot;Like how?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Jeff suddenly felt a bit flustered. &quot;Like their bodies. Make them bigger. Stronger. Or maybe even like us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us?&quot; Finn laughed. &quot;A couple of jocks?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stared blankly for a couple of seconds. Somehow Finn didn&#39;t see the two of them any different than anyone else. Sure, everyone else in the restaurant did. Or at least they looked more interested in them for other reasons. But none of them were for being a big tiger or ram. Even for Finn to see at as so completely normal, felt weird. Jeff quickly added a laugh. &quot;Yeah. Exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Finn took a second to think about it. &quot;Maybe... But I don&#39;t think I&#39;d make them all as strong as us. And if any of them got too close, I might just shrink them down a bit. I know you like them big, but I don&#39;t want the attention to get off me. You know?&quot; He grabbed at his burly belly, rubbing it suggestively.<br />
<br />
However, the two were quickly interrupted by the waiter. He placed a coaster in front of each of them. &quot;Hi my name is--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Todd?!&quot; Jeff interrupted. They were friends. Or at least had been when Jeff was a human. Both were taking computer programming classes. Technically Jeff still was, he just wasn&#39;t having to do as much work as he had been. Afterall, he needed to keep his football scholarship. Todd was a bit shorter than average and a bit more portly as well. His rounder body and bout with acne in high school really made him easy to make fun of. And now with Jeff not being his friend anymore, he really seemed to be a bit more standoffish. Or maybe that was just because of who Jeff was now.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s eyes narrowed. As did Finn&#39;s. &quot;So now you remember my name... Anyways, what do you two want to drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff ordered two beers. But before Todd could leave, he grabbed the smaller man by the arm. Todd spun around with a wicked flash of anger. &quot;Hey,&quot; Jeff tried to be light. &quot;I kind of wanted to talk to you about our homework. Do you have a bit of time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if you noticed this,&quot; Todd sneered, &quot;but I am at work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. But. Uhh... Shit,&quot; Jeff tried to think about the right words but they wouldn&#39;t come to him as easily as they had. &quot;I needed to talk to you about... Uhh... Re--ality disruption dy something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd paused a second, mouth hanging open. &quot;Reality Distorting Dynamics? How the fuck do you know about that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Homework?&quot; Jeff shrugged. Finn&#39;s eyes were really honing in on him now. This was not how Jeff spoke. &quot;Can we talk. Just for a minute? Just a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure...&quot; Todd said as he led him over to the bar. Jeff kept looking over his shoulder, begging for forgiveness from his boyfriend. Todd rolled his eyes as he leaned against the wall under some popular 90&#39;s movie that if people had seen should not have been in there. His eyes glared up at Jeff. &quot;So how do you know about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because... Because we used to be friends and I might have used it,&quot; Jeff pushed his paws together as he looked down at Todd.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s glare only worsened as it turned into a huff. &quot;I&#39;ll send Allison over to your table. God knows she&#39;s begging for it...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No wait! You have to believe me,&quot; Jeff grabbed him by the arm. <br />
<br />
Todd was quick to pull out and then push a finger deep into Jeff&#39;s chest. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because... Because... Uhh....&quot; Jeff was floundering. He knew it. His ears folded back on the top of his head. The memories he had with Todd were quickly changing to just about nothing or seeing the little guy as some kind of dork. Then it hit him. &quot;Because I know your favorite anime.&quot; Todd&#39;s stance changed as though he was listening. &quot;It&#39;s... Shit... It&#39;s... The one where uhhh... someone dies and then got powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just described about 70% of what came out in the last year dumbass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No damnit it&#39;s not that isekai shit. It was something cool. Like he could shoot a bullet out of his finger and he hunted demons or some shit,&quot; Jeff felt himself falling back into his current form again. It was hard to think about, but even in his jock self could remember turning it on and watch some demon get its head hopped off. Or see the super buff demon brag about how he was only using like 20% of his power to destroy a parking garage.<br />
<br />
But the distain on Todd&#39;s face softened. &quot;Fine,&quot; not a lot, but enough to show that he was listening. &quot;Let&#39;s say I believe you. Now what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to show you. I think I screwed something up. Right now, I don&#39;t know what it is, but something weird&#39;s going to happen. Okay?&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
Todd took a second to answer. &quot;I get off at 10. I can&#39;t leave any earlier. Alright?&quot; His finger went back into the cavern between Jeff&#39;s pecs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Jeff flexed his body as he cheered. The restaurant all seemed to look. Jeff continued to give them a few more less conspicuous ones as he sauntered back to his table. <br />
<br />
Finn&#39;s eyebrow raised skeptically. &quot;What was that about?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Homework,&quot; Jeff lied.</p>
