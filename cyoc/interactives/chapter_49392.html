<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Son?&quot; Kaylee asked about Jensen's reference to Bart. <br />
<br />
&quot;Be silent Kaylee.&quot; Jensen said like a man watching his favorite football game not turning <br />
his eyes away from a second from the transformation of Kaylee's parents. <br />
<br />
Kaylee obeyed her master submissively as she had been transformed to be. 'I had been <br />
looking foreword to having cubs, but I really looking foreword to doing more of the stuff <br />
you need to do in order to get cubs first with Master.' Oh well, it wasn't like their pack was <br />
likely to stay small anyway.  Then another thought thunder struck Kaylee, 'Do they think of <br />
me as their mother?' <br />
<br />
Well, she was Alpha female by her own declaration, and Master hadn't objected... Kaylee <br />
actually felt a tiny bit overwhelmed at the prospect of the four, and more to come, on the <br />
other hand, she also felt a tiny bit of excitement too. 'Well, I knew this was coming, I just <br />
didn't think it would come this fast.' Then again, everything with her and Master was <br />
happening fast. <br />
<br />
Only this morning she was Kyle Perkins, high school freshman with the Game in his hot <br />
little hands, now she was Kaylee of the Big Bad Wolf Pack Alpha female and possibly an <br />
adopted mother of four if the fur on her transforming parents was any indication from <br />
Master's own transformed parents. <br />
<br />
She'd have also mentioned that Master had forgotten to instruct Bart to include the <br />
transformation for her parents to keep their adult educations and competency, but she <br />
knew the transform couldn't be retrofitted or taken back now that the changes were <br />
underway, the game didn't allow for such take backs on the same turn Kaylee remembered <br />
the old web page on the Glendale.gov's site, the dang webpage was so old that it even had <br />
out dated coding on it, 'thing looked like it hadn't been updated since the site was first <br />
put up.'  All in all, if her parents didn't keep their adult IQs and thus would be useless in <br />
running the estate, that at least it wouldn't be Kaylee's tail in hot water this time. Maybe <br />
they'd keep their adult educations, maybe they wouldn't, Kaylee would wait and see. <br />
<br />
So Kaylee chose to just enjoy the show of her parents ascension into big bad wolfhood <br />
leaning next to her seated master/mate, not trying to flung Bart's grasp of her tail as Jenny <br />
also watched from her seat her former daughter, former son's lap. <br />
<br />
 +++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew.&quot; Fran said wiping the wetness from her nose (where canines sweated), her ears <br />
slightly welted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can almost appreciate the effort those scum go through when they slice up the cars they <br />
steal eh sister?&quot; Darla asked removing her goggles and gloves the moment as her twin did <br />
the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;-Almost- sister.&quot; Fran answered kicking the still standing seats down as they fell apart <br />
from her kick. Fran and Darla's rebirth as identical wolf twins had not given them any <br />
newfound sympathy for the criminals they had gone through misery to catch and haul off <br />
to jail.  &quot;Those filth do what they do for easy money, because they can't find or hold a job, <br />
or want to impress their buddies. We're doing this for a higher cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can say that again.&quot; Darla said, &quot;We are going this for a greater reason than money or <br />
prestige, this is for the Master and his pack. Thinking about Julie sister?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Only a little, we do have a job to do, and after all, we both know trying to contact a family <br />
member is the last mistake many people who need to avoid public notice make sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right sister, but still, I can tell you hope we get a chance to add her and the kids to <br />
the pack. You do have the game after all still.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's for master to decide how I use it. And we're too few and too vulnerable right now <br />
for me to do something risky like that. I know from experience master will love having <br />
Julie in his pack and the girls. But it's just too risky.&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla found a couple of soda and a pair of straws left in a nearby cooler for the yard staff <br />
and put in a couple of straws for the she-wolves to sip and handed one to her twin. <br />
&quot;Makes me wish I had family I could bring into the pack for the Master, but I just have my <br />
parents and they don't even live in Glendale and never visit.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran drank the soda with the speed of an oil well, Darla doing the same, their sips and <br />
pulls in sync with one another. It felt good when it was like that: their synchronization <br />
gave both such a sense of inner peace. Fran and Darla knew this was total a bastardization <br />
of the individuality of other twins, but for the twin blond wolves: their reflection was a <br />
comfort in of itself, &quot;Don't worry  sister, that just means you have less to worry about. You <br />
should be glade you don't have that many personal connections that would leave people <br />
wondering about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you're right about that sister.&quot; The twins finish their sodas at the same time and <br />
Fran began to organize and what not the remains of her family's car now just a pile of <br />
parts as Darla began to cut into pieces the Perkin's car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful sister, I want this done as fast as possible too,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed to get back to the master and alpha female. I feel like we're missing a movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel that way too. But it will be a lot longer if we accident cut off our fingers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right sister.&quot; Darla nodded her twin and herself putting back on their goggles and gloves <br />
and continued their half done task with earnest. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Kaylee felt a little weighted down by the grip of both Bart and Jenny, but she was also a <br />
little pleased too. <br />
<br />
Kevin and Marcy meanwhile held hands and moved closer together at the Big Bad Wolf's <br />
approach. Marcy took hold of one of Kevin's shoulder in her other paw while Kevin held <br />
Marcy's hand in both his paws.  The two seven year old as their ages went clear past <br />
puberty and clear into childhood past Bart and Jenny's age, making them even smaller than <br />
the giant beast Kyle's witless 'transform' had brought into the world. <br />
<br />
With Marcy close to him, Kevin managed to find some traces of final inner strength, and <br />
together they looked up defiantly at the Big Bad Wolf.<br />
<br />
Jensen was surprised by the look in their eyes, unlike his own parents, Jensen saw -<br />
courage- in those eyes. This was rather disorienting for the Big Bad Wolf, the idea of <br />
someone so small facing him with overcome fear was a bit confusing. <br />
<br />
While more muscle toned than any human seven year old could hope to be, they were <br />
nothing compared to Jensen. And yet they looked at him not afraid. <br />
<br />
Then in one motion, Marcy shortly followed by Kevin the two wolf cups leaped and bit with <br />
their new fangs into the Big Bag Wolf's meaty lower legs. Jensen roared, Kaylee and the <br />
other cups flattened their ears at the sound. <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU LITTLE BRATS!&quot; Jesen kicked, and the dislodging fangs of the Perkins left a red lines <br />
in his legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Der's nothin' worse ya can do ta us!&quot; Marcy returned determined. <br />
<br />
&quot;YEAH!&quot; Kevin backed up his 'husband.'<br />
<br />
&quot;MASTER!&quot; Kaylee was at her mate's side in a blink of an eye. <br />
<br />
Jensen knocked her away and Kaylee began bowing about a hundred times. <br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny leapt across the room and tackled the two smaller wolfens cubs sending <br />
them skidding across the floor. <br />
<br />
Jensen cursed as his leg's black fur was matted with blood. If he wasn't seeing red, Jensen <br />
would have thought about the scientific fact he remembered from science class that no <br />
material was indestructible when struck against itself. This apparently included Big Bad <br />
Wolves. <br />
<br />
Jenny and Marcy, and Bart and Kevin, tumbled around on the floor of the office, clawing <br />
and biting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop before your gorge out an eye!&quot; Kaylee shouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;YOU HURT MASTER!&quot; &quot;DON'T YOU DARE HURT MASTER!&quot; Bart and Jenny shouted sounding <br />
enraged as only a child could be. <br />
<br />
&quot;BREAK-APART-NOW!&quot; Kaylee growled even deeper and more menacing then ever before. <br />
<br />
Her words sent shuddering down to the base of the bones of all four cubs who felt a wave <br />
from their gut that -screamed- at them to stop and they obeyed. <br />
<br />
Kaylee went to Marcy and Kevin at once and knocked their heads together, this time only <br />
producing an echoing &quot;OW!&quot; Rather than rendering them unconscious. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you ever do that again!&quot; Kaylee waved her finger, Kevin tried to bite it but Kaylee <br />
grab his head and slammed into the rug floor. Kevin got up an instantly later so no much <br />
as a tooth chipped but feeling dizzy all the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now sit still until you're ready to behave! Or I'll spank your rears until you're redder than <br />
cherries!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kevin and Marcy and did exactly as they were told, terrified of the prospect of being <br />
spanked, and an overwhelming sense of shame and fault for having her so upset with <br />
them, they actually looked down not able to face her in the eye. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now stand up.&quot; They did so without hesitation. &quot;Turn around.&quot; Again, they did so <br />
dreading what they knew was coming.  A quick strike to both of their rears make them give <br />
up a sharp &quot;Yip!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now turn back around.&quot; Kaylee said no humor or pleasure in her voice at all. <br />
<br />
The two younger cubs obeyed still not looking her in the eye, a couple of tears trickling <br />
down their faces. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look up.&quot;<br />
<br />
They inched their heads up their eyes glistening with tears.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now what did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We-we....&quot; Kevin gutted out, &quot;We hurt Master.&quot; An the sense of shame and wrongness that <br />
brought was enough that Kevin felt dizzy again. <br />
<br />
&quot;We-eh-eh ... hurt.. our A-Alph-phe-a.&quot; Marcy also managed to get out, knowing her in <br />
gut she had something incomprehensibly horrible. <br />
<br />
&quot;And was that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...no-oh-oh.&quot; &quot;Noooo...&quot; The two managed to drag out between their sobs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to do it again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NEVER!&quot; &quot;NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Kevin, Marcy.&quot; The two wolf cubs reacted to the names without hesitation or <br />
confusion. &quot;Apologize to Master Jesen for what you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny actually giggled a bit seeing the two other cubs in trouble but a glare form <br />
Kaylee took care of that. <br />
<br />
Kevin and Marcy practically crawled in front of Jesen before saying, still crying, &quot;M-Mas-<br />
ter, we're... we're... s-sor-ory!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We're reallyreally reallyreally reallyreally reallyreally reallyreally really SORRY!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen looked down at them, and the two cubs involuntarily marked their territory where <br />
they crawled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stand.&quot; Jensen ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't move a muscle.&quot; They did so. Jensen then put his jaws around each of their heads <br />
(they were big enough for their heads to fit inside) in turn and then withdrew nothing <br />
having left so much as a one strand of fur out of place. He then took their heads and <br />
rubbed their noses in their own mark. He then let go. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now are you sorry?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES!!!&quot; The two wolf cubs said their eyes almost red from crying. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry for what?&quot; Jensen's voice was icy calm. <br />
<br />
&quot;FOR HURTING YOU MASTER I'M SO SO SO SORRY!&quot; &quot;I'M MEGA UBER JUMBO GOOGLEX <br />
SORRRY!&quot; <br />
<br />
The group stayed totally silent for several seconds. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now who are you? What are you? And who am I?&quot; Jensen asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Marcy, I'm part of our pack, your pack, you're our master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Kevin, I'm sorry, you're the Big Bad Wolf, our pack's alpha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their voice held no sarcasm or irony, no defiance or anger. Only the the worry and shame <br />
of a couple kids that knew they had royally screwed up and couldn't think of how to fix it. <br />
<br />
Jesen put his hands on their little heads, &quot;And you're part of my pack, you are loyal to me, <br />
you obey me, you protect me, you serve me, this pack is your family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're part've da pack an' we're gonna protect ya and help ya an' our pack.&quot; Said Marcy. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll protect ya, help ya, and da pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; He ruffled her hair making the two giggle. &quot;Now Bart and Jenny are going to have a <br />
lot to do and I want you to help them in any way they ask got'it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesh Mastah!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Ma'lord.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee said, &quot;Bart, Jenny, it wasn't Kevin and Marcy who hurt Master, so you're not gonna <br />
so much as say one mean thing to be or do one mean thing to them over that understand? <br />
And if I catch you doing so you're the ones who are gonna end up with red rears <br />
understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely!&quot; &quot;Perfectly.&quot; The two nine year old wolfen cubs yelped.  Bart began thinking <br />
how they were gonna have to order some voice synthesizers to help set up the system the <br />
big bad wolf was gonna need, they wouldn't need them forever, just long enough that they <br />
could construct the system the pack would need to use the estate to it's full advantage. <br />
<br />
<br />
Fran and Darla side by side entered. &quot;Master we followed your scent once we were done <br />
and--MASTER!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;First aid kit.&quot; Jesen groaned.<br />
<br />
 Darla was a blond bolt of lightning as she leapt down stairs not even bothering with the <br />
stairs using the indoor balcony instead to the floor below and in a search so quick it <br />
would make some internet engines green with envy she located the kitchen and the first <br />
aid kit and climbed back up the stairs nearly as quickly as she had leapt down them. At the <br />
same time Fran helped her master control the bleeding. <br />
<br />
Jensen explained where the bite marks had  come from to the twins. <br />
<br />
&quot;What big teeth they have.&quot; Fran examined the bites. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just Like their father.&quot; Jensen groaned. &quot;Fran you patch me up, Darla, you patch up the <br />
cubs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; They said together and bowed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you all so cute,&quot; Said Darla, &quot;What are your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bart.&quot; &quot;Jenny.&quot; &quot;Kevin.&quot; &quot;Marcy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well all of you line up and I'll help you out one at a time.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Wolf cubs obeyed ass Darla and Fran set to work. <br />
<br />
&quot;Darla.&quot; Said Kaylee. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha female?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you... teach me how to do that? The first aid stuff I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly alpha female! I'd be glade to! Now just follow along now--&quot;<br />
<br />
The four wolf cubs stood in line looking at each other, some part of them all having <br />
enjoyed the rough housing but regretted it had to happen the way it did. The scratched up <br />
seven year olds leaned their backs into the scratched up nine year olds who didn't try to <br />
push them away.</p>
