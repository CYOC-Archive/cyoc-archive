<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well, we can’t just leave these dicks lying around,” said Sam, standing next to Spencer and staring down at the throbbing cocks laying on the couch. <br />
<br />
“Maybe we should each take care of one, until they change back.” said Spencer, helping himself to another beer. He still feel Nick’s balls churning in anger within his pants.<br />
<br />
“But who get’s which cock?” asked Sam, accepting another beer from Spencer.<br />
<br />
Spencer chewed his lip and thought about it while staring at the two cocks. Joe had a nice girthiness to pair with his respectable eight inches of length, but next to Rob it was no comparison. Spencer hadn’t ever seen a cock like that in his life; a twelve inch long tube, delicately lined by throbbing veins, with a pair of egg-sized balls to match. <br />
<br />
“I’m taking Rob,” he said, picking up the schlong and reveling in how heavy the length felt in his hands. Nick began to harden in Spencer’s pants despite himself.<br />
<br />
“What?” whined Sam. “No way! He’s my co-worker!”<br />
<br />
“But with Nick between my legs I’ve lost an inch; and when Nick turns back in two weeks, I promise to send him home with Rob.” He held out his hand. “Deal?”<br />
<br />
Sam shrugged his shoulders and shook his new friends hand. “Sounds fair. Hey, at least with Joe I get free weed for the next seven weeks.” He picked up the thick eight-incher and used Joe’s phone to turn on the voice option.<br />
<br />
“Its gonna cost you an orgasm per gram, buddy!” Joe laughed through his cockslit before moaning as Sam began to squeeze and massage his balls. <br />
<br />
“Sounds like a bargain to me!” laughed Spencer. He found his shirt and shoes and began redressing himself, taking care to grab Rob’s phone and clothes as well. Rob seemed to be enjoying himself and was still almost fully hard, too large for Spencer to stuff down his pants along side Nick like he planned. Instead, he stuffed the big schlong under his shirt and stuffed his shirt under his belt, trapping Rob’s warm length against his stomach. <br />
<br />
“So, you gonna play with the app again?” Spencer asked, rubbing placing his hand over the big cock under his shirt like it was a baby.<br />
<br />
“Maybe. I’ll be honest, man, being a dick was fun. But I didn’t want to be like that for a year!” He tossed back a deep swig of beer at the prospect. “I was hoping Nick would get horny and use the app again. Maybe when Nick is back I’ll go again; somebody has to take care of Joseph.” He grinned, giving the big cock a playful squeeze. <br />
<br />
“Speaking of ‘taking care of our cocks’,” began Spencer, finishing his beer. “I think I better call it a night.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, me too. Its funny, I feel like cumming is more exhausting as a man than when you’re just a cock. Nick was stroking me off all day today and I just couldn’t get enough. But now,” he yawned, unconsciously moving the hand holding Joseph up to his open mouth. Spencer laughed. <br />
<br />
They made sure to exchange numbers before Spencer left. Both men were eager to have some alone time with their new cocks. Spencer strode confidently up to his car and was about to get in when Rob began to throb and harden against Spencer’s chest. Spencer grabbed Rob’s phone and turned on the voice option.<br />
<br />
“Hey, man! Grab my keys, I heard them fall between the seat when I got dicked the first time.” Spencer extracted the keys from Rob’s car and locked it, pocketing them before stepping into his own car and driving off back home.<br />
<br />
He arrived at a your typical block of suburban apartments, hearing one or two of them alive with the sounds of laughter and live music. He knew it wasn’t his home; he currently lived alone and he’d spent the last few months enjoying the single life. He opened the door to his humble apartment, dropping his keys on a table and heading for his bedroom. Spencer wasted no time, tearing off his clothes so fast he forgot he’d tucked Rob under his shirt. The big cock flopped to the carpeted ground with an audible thump and an “Ow!” as Robs sensitive head and balls hit the floor. <br />
<br />
“Oh, shit! Sorry, Rob!” cried Spencer, diving down to pick up the big cock and place him gently on the bed.<br />
<br />
“Be careful with me, man!” shouted Rob. He was enjoying being his own cock, even if it was for four months, but he still wasn’t so sure about Spencer yet.<br />
<br />
“I’ll be more careful, I promise.” Spencer said, removing his boxers and letting Nick swing free. Spencer climbed on the bed and began delicately stroking the big cock that was Rob up and down his hard length. Rob’s bulbous head flared, a drop of precum escaping the tip. “You’re a beautiful cock, Rob.” Spencer purred.<br />
<br />
Rob sighed and pulsed against the sheets, “Uh, thank you.” Spencer wrapped his hand around Rob’s head, covering his vision while he rubbed his thumb over sensitive strip of skin hanging just below Rob’s ‘mouth’.<br />
<br />
“I’ll bet you’re pretty popular with ladies,” he said, his other hand reaching around to massage Rob’s enormous balls. Nick was steadily hardening between his legs.<br />
<br />
“Not really,” Rob sighed from between Nick’s fingers. “Usually…people…are too afraid to take me.” he confessed through a moan. “They think its too big.”<br />
<br />
God that’s hot, thought Spencer. “Well, you’re in luck, Rob. Over these next two weeks, and hopefully for the rest of your time as a dick, I’m going to make sure you come as hard and as often as I can. A beautiful cock like you deserves proper attention.” He said, leaning forward to give Rob a long lick, from his balls at the base of his shaft, all the way up to the head. <br />
<br />
“Oh, fuck me, that feels so good,” Rob moaned, his balls tensing in Spencer’s hand. “But wait, are you gay?” <br />
<br />
Spencer giggled. “If you must know, I’m pansexual. What about you, big boy?” he asked as he started kissing up and down the cock’s length.<br />
<br />
“I think…Oh god…I think I’m bi,” he wondered aloud before Spencer silenced him with a deep and hard kiss on his throbbing cock head.<br />
<br />
“Well, Rob. You’re your own dick now, and I have a dicked man hanging between my legs. I think we can leave labels at the door.” He said, before lifting the big schlong up off the bed and taking it into his mouth. He could hear Rob moan as Spencer lovingly sucked his head, roving his tongue along the glans. He adjusted his grip on Rob’s balls and began to slowly force another inch into his mouth. Spencer’s eyes watered as Rob’s head probed the back of his throat; he mustered all of his will power to suppress his gag reflex, giving Rob another thrust. Spencer was high off better drugs than weed if he thought he could fit all of those twelve inches down his throat, but damned if he wasn’t going to try. Between his legs, Nick seemed to have gotten with the program, his cock body at full mast and begging silently for attention.<br />
<br />
Spencer worked on Rob the cock for another few minutes before finally withdrawing the giant thing, clenching his jaw while Rob pulsed and throbbed in his other hand.<br />
<br />
“Wait, don’t stop! I was getting deeper!” he protested.<br />
<br />
“Dude, I’m gonna choke.” Laughed Spencer, wiping his mouth.<br />
<br />
“God damn, man. I’ve never been this hard in my life.” Rob moaned. Spencer lay back on the bed, his next to the giant cock.<br />
<br />
“Well, yeah. Look at you; was there even ever enough blood to fill that thing?” he teased.<br />
<br />
“Fuck you, man. You’re just jealous.” Rob retorted in a mock tone. <br />
<br />
“Can’t be jealous with almost 20 inches of cock on my hands.” Spencer said simply, reaching for his bedside table to grab a couple objects.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing over there?” Rob asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
“Getting myself ready,” Spencer replied. He heard a spraying sound, and then spencer took a deep breath, and then his hands were all over Robs hard cock body again. Only this time, they were covered in something slick and liquid.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?” Rob asked, enjoying how smoothly Spencer’s fingers glided over his sensitive skin.<br />
<br />
“Lube. I hope you’re not allergic to silicone.” He said in a mischievous tone.<br />
<br />
Rob was about to ask what for, when Spencer’s big hands wrapped themselves tightly around his body and began performing long strokes. Rob moaned and grew harder in Spencer’s hands, his balls tightening against the base of his shaft. His head flared up, finally free of his foreskin, and Rob could feel his whole body was covered in a good layer of lubricant. <br />
<br />
“Alright, you’re ready. Now lets pray to dick gods that I am,” Spencer said solemnly. <br />
<br />
Rob felt himself get picked up and swung around until he found himself staring straight at Spencer’s hairy asshole. Spencer’s other hand came around to apply a bit more lube before Rob’s head was pressed against Spencer’s tight opening. He teased robs head around the edge before pressing him in; he braced himself and pressed a little harder, feeling Rob’s bulbous head pop into him followed by a sharp but brief wave of pain. Feeling emboldened, he started pressing Rob in further. He couldn’t hear Rob’s voice anymore, but judging by the way he felt the cock pulse and throb inside of him, Rob was clearly enjoying himself. Using his hand to check, Spencer found that Rob was only half way in! He took another deep breath and continued pushing Rob by the balls until his rob couldn’t go any further. Spencer held himself still, luxuriating in the sensation of Rob’s enormous length filling him, stretching him, of the cock’s pendulous balls resting against Nick’s dwarfing them considerably. <br />
<br />
Spencer grabbed Rob’s balls and began to slowly work Rob in and out of his ass, increasing his pace and his depth as the pain and discomfort slowly succumbed to pleasure and contentment. He gasped as Rob was forced deeper into him than anything before; he knew it was a joke but it really did feel like the guy was in his stomach. Meanwhile, deep inside Spencer’s ass, Rob was in heaven. His anal walls caressed every square inch of Rob’s body; he could feel Spencer’s prostate pressing against him lower down on his shaft. Every time Rob went a little deeper or stretched Spencer in just the right way, the man’s anal muscles would clamp down over his body, driving him wild. He couldn’t see, he couldn’t breathe, but he didn’t need to! His eyes would have been closed in ecstasy anyways.<br />
<br />
With one hand busily assisting Rob in fucking his ass, Spencer reached down with his other hand and began to give Nick the attention he needed. He took Nick’s hard length into his hands and began jerking him in synch with Rob’s thrusts. Unable to speak, Nick could only sit back and experience the ride; he could feel Rob’s enormous cock sliding in and out of Spencer’s ass as if it were his own, in addition to the stimulus of Spencer’s big hand rapidly stroking his body. His balls churned and ached below him; he could feel the pressure building. Likewise, Spencer could tell by the way Rob’s balls clenched in his hand that the big cock was getting close. He increased his pace until Rob’s egg-sized balls were slapping against Nick’s own modest pair. Spencer felt the pressure reach a breaking point in his balls; at the same time, Rob and Nick could feel it building in the back of their throats. The three men moaned and swore aloud as they came, but only Spencer’s groans and growls could be heard. Rob unleashed a torrent of cum from his heaving balls, feeling it spurt from his mouth over and over deep inside Spencer. Nick came as well, Spencer groaning and writhing for the dicked man as Nick fired his hot load all over Spencer’s hairy chest. Rob was in pure bliss as Spencer’s anal muscles clamped and flexed around him, milking the last of his cum from his throat and leaving the big cock spent. Spencer collapsed against the pillows, shifting his position so that Rob could rest comfortably inside him while he softened. He held Nick’s softening form in his hands, feeling the dicked man bob and pulse with their aftershocks. Spencer wanted to un-mute his voice and hear what Nick was feeling, but he decided to let the dicked man ruminate in silence until the morning. <br />
Rob was overwhelmed; finally, he had a chance to let loose and go balls deep in somebody, literally! He was so proud and happy that he couldn’t find it in himself to go soft, instead focusing on wriggling and throbbing as much as he could to keep himself erect. He felt Spencer’s body jolt and a hand clasp around his balls. Spencer laughed as he gripped the big cock by the balls and held him in place while he caught his breath. That cock, I mean Rob, sure has an appetite, thought Spencer. He raised his head to look down at Nick, still rock hard and cradled in Spencer’s idle hand. Damn, Sam was right, he thought, these cocks can probably come for hours with no break. He smiled, his reaching down to give Rob a firm shove, arching his back as the big cock probed within him. The night was still young, and he wasn’t going to bed just yet.</p>
