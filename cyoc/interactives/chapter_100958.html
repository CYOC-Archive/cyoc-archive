<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the days turned into weeks Micheal was becoming increasingly more comfortable with his mother-in-law living with the family. So much so that he could scarcely compare the bossy old woman that had barely allowed him to marry Mary Ann, to the drop dead gorgeous young woman that had come to dominate his house. <br />
<br />
The &quot;Aunt&quot; persona had overtaken almost all aspects of the Madeline he was used to. This young Madeline was an ambitious yet fun-loving woman that had quickly gained the love of the kids, especially the boys whom she often took out on escapades in town while Mary Ann was left looking after baby Charlotte. <br />
<br />
For his part, Micheal was just completely flabbergasted by Madeline. She now kept her light brown hair perfectly rounded just above the shoulders which only accentuated her hot, young vibe look to the 44 year old man. Micheal found himself thinking of Madeline when he was having sex with Mary Ann. He was able to forego foreplay with his wife by simply imaging her mother&#39;s rejuvenation from an elderly woman to the young woman she was now. He would have killed to have been able to see her transformation and with each and every time he climaxed inside his curvy wife, he utterly regretted that it wasn&#39;t inside Madeline instead.  <br />
<br />
Mary Ann must have sensed this as well because the rivalry between the two women reached a breaking point on a Friday night after a lazy dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; his wife declared, &quot;I think its time we permanently Agetrip into the family. Don&#39;t you agree?&quot;<br />
<br />
Madeline nodded her head in agreement. &quot;Of course honey! My time with this body is ticking away as we speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How old are you going to be Aunt Madeline?&quot; Asked Jack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Jack,&quot; Madeline replied, &quot;I was thinking about Agetripping back another 10 years or so. I have been seriously considering going back to college and starting a new career.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually Mom,&quot; Mary Ann said, &quot;Since you&#39;ve been getting along with the boys so well, Micheal and I were thinking about Agetripping you back to when you were just 9 years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A 4th grader?!!! Mary Ann you are being ridiculous! Why would you want to turn me into a child again?&quot; Madeline yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it would be good for you Mother and I&#39;ve always thought you looked wonderful in your old school photos.&quot; Mary Ann countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is insane! I thought the three of us had an agreement!&quot; The younger woman continued to yell.<br />
<br />
Micheal certainly hadn&#39;t been apart of this decision and he made it known to his family, &quot;I don&#39;t remember agreeing to that. What&#39;s gotten into you Mary Ann?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are such a horrible witch of a mother! All I want to do is repay you for raising me into the woman I am and instead you just turn my own family against me!&quot; his wife cried. The dejected eyes Mary Ann flashed him were telling, he would be sleeping on the couch tonight. <br />
<br />
The awkward silence after his wife had stormed upstairs and slammed the door was eventually interrupted by Madeline, &quot;Alright kids. I think its time you all went to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
For the next hour Micheal sat alone on the family couch sipping on hard liquor. Just as he finished his second drink it was refilled by Madeline standing behind him. &quot;Mind if I sit down Micheal?&quot; she asked while holding a drink of her own in her right hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Micheal answered already a bit drunk. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to apologize for my daughter. She shouldn&#39;t punish you for speaking your mind.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Madeline but my wife is a full grown adult.&quot; he responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true that she is fully grown but she is a womanchild through and through. I think it&#39;s why you married her after all. Am I wrong?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Micheal softly laughed at that which seemed to work just as well for Madeline as a yes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I failed her as a mother.&quot; Madeline admitted, &quot;her failures are my failures.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s too harsh Madeline, both you and Mary Ann are two of the most amazing women I have ever met. There&#39;s no failing in that.&quot; Micheal told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your wife has turned you into a criminal Micheal just so she could play at being a mom.&quot; Madeline continued. &quot;You have risked your entire career for her and I&#39;m afraid you may have already lost it. Did Mary Ann ever tell you why you are childless despite trying your hardest to have kids of your own?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No but I suspect she was infertile if that&#39;s what you&#39;re getting at Madeline.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She lost her fertility to a horrible disease when she was a preteen girl. Micheal do you love your wife? Truly love her? Not the aging woman you have sex with every other night but person she is? Her hopes and dreams included?&quot; Madeline asked bluntly.<br />
<br />
A grimness consumed Micheal as he silently nodded to Madeline. He was beginning to see the point of this conversation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now I won&#39;t lie. I was very pretty girl as a child Micheal. Beautiful in fact. If Mary Ann gets her way tomorrow I would be a very darling daughter to you and her. But you have an opportunity here that no man has truly accomplished in his life. To truly have complete control over your wife for her own good. Regress her into the 9 year old girl that she wants to be but stubbornly denies for herself.&quot; Madeline said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She would hate me and you.&quot; Micheal said, trying his best to hold back his raging erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not when you tell her that she can actually become pregnant with her own children when she grows up again. Mary Ann will gladly call you daddy once she realizes what we have finally given her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We?&quot; Micheal asked, though he already knew the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Micheal, I would step into the role of your wife in my daughter&#39;s place. I would give you the love and respect a man like you deserves and I would raise our four children with all the care in the world as you work your way up AgeCorp. I would be the ultimate trophy wife for you.&quot; She stated.<br />
<br />
If the sheer temptation wasn&#39;t enough for Micheal, his erected penis unloaded when Madeline french kissed him. Madeline gave him a sly wink and a warm smile as she went upstairs to her guest room.<br />
<br />
Micheal poured himself one last drink, and decided his plan of action tomorrow.</p>
