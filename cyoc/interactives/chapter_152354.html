<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things were relatively calm in the Great Hall as Clara went about her business. There wasn&#39;t too much at the moment and much of what often was there was ceremonial. Some of it was that most of those that were often against Animalia in the present administration were busy with other distractions at the moment. That was something that Clara took great relief in, as it meant fewer speeches, fewer arguments, and fewer responses to things said in Washington DC in what seemed to be a never ending tit for tat attempt to try and one up the other. There were some that she agreed with, but there were times when the antics that went on in that city seemed more focused on power and one upping the other rather than actually governing for all of America.<br />
<br />
Not having to respond to those sorts of issues gave Clara the time to carry out the jobs and roles that her position as Mayor often brought with it that she did like, and her thoughts drifted back to the previous weekend as she was able to be there for one of love&#39;s small victories...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Gay marriage wasn&#39;t something that was legal everywhere, but it was something that was becoming legal in an increasing number of states across the country and most at least were willing to tolerate allow something for same sex couples that was something like marriage. While Animalia had no exact knowledge on Nevada&#39;s state law and Animalians generally seemed have their sexuality purely geared for breeding, Clara had never seen a reason to deny people the right to love. It was why the ten edicts forbade inter-species breeding but said nothing about love. As the city got started and Clara had learned that some of the Humans, who were accidentally transformed in the initial outbreak and before the vaccine for the Animalia Virus was developed, were Homosexual, she&#39;d promoted the idea of supporting  same-sex marriage rights in Animalia.<br />
<br />
And while there were a few couples that Clara had known about for awhile, most of them though were in positions where they&#39;d have to wait before they could actually marry. However, thanks to one of the present administration&#39;s quirks, there was the opportunity for a large same-sex wedding to be held and Clara was actually quite delighted to officiate the ceremonies. Even if they were to be something more of a massed wedding with a few couples all coming to get married at the same time, but as Clara took her position to conduct the ceremony, she was still pleased to see friendly guests that were there in the crowd. Most were Animalians, who had obviously worked with or met one of the participants in the wedding, however there were a few Humans that were there in the crowd as well. They all sat chairs in the Great Hall and waited for ceremony to start. There was on large curtain that hung over the back area that separated the audience from what was normally the entryway to the Great Hall, and behind that curtain the Homosexual Anonymous members that were there to get married<br />
<br />
&quot;And the people who &quot;sent&quot; them here think this is all about &quot;curing&quot; them,&quot; Clara chuckled to herself, knowing that the quirk that was largely leaving Animalia alone was the fact that those Humans that were homosexual seemed to have their sexuality &quot;change&quot; to become more bisexual after conversion. People that opposed gay marriage naturally saw Animalia as a &quot;cure&quot; for the problem. Clara was happy some were willing to convert and had tried her best to make sure that none felt unwelcome or that the change would change who the people were, for doin that wasn&#39;t loving.<br />
<br />
Clara then nodded to a side where one of the lower ranking staff members who was crouching by a cd player by the wall and plugged into a nearby outlet. The staff member pressed a button on the top of the CD player and the wedding march was soon playing from it. With that audio cue, the curtain began to pull open slowly to reveal the members coming in to be married. The first two to come in were Ella and Simone. They both wore a pair of simple white dresses that had some black and gold highlights to them. They both waved to a couple of feline Animalians in the crowd as they walked by. Clara though they were big cats, like Ella and Simone were, but with the many guests present and her angle at watching the approaching brides was such that Clara couldn&#39;t be fully sure on who they were waving to.<br />
<br />
The next two to come in where Herman Oceanroar and Jason Clearwake. The two male Orca and Great White Animalians walked hand in hand with each in a snappy looking suit and with eyes that drifted to each other as they came up the aisle together. There had been some stories that the two had been heavily seeing the two women that followed close behind them, Arlene and Moxie and had been living together in an odd exchange. The two pair were said to live in  largely homosexual love lives with each other, but would occasionally have some fun with the other set... Jason with Arlene and Herman with Moxie. It was odd, and Clara couldn&#39;t quite keep all the stories straight, but none of them reported any problem. That was enough for Clara to find plenty to be accepting of. Unlike Ella and Simone, though, Arlene and Moxie wore a pair of suits that practically mirrored Herman and Jason&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you all for coming,&quot; Clara spoke, &quot;We are gathered today to join two Feline Animalians... a Lioness and a Panthers, Ella and Simone, two male Animalians, Herman and Jason... one an Orca the other a Great White, and two more female Animalians. Arlene and Moxie, another Orca and Great White pairing.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few small claps from the audience before Clara continued, noting that each couple before her smiled to the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Animalia has brought the world many things... intelligent life that is different from Humanity and beautiful in its own way and has hopefully presented the world with something new and something that can rise above old prejudices and biases,&quot; Clara spoke &quot;and these unions today may hopefully further that trend. To demonstrate to the world that Animalia cares for love first and foremost. For love is not so much about what is in our Edicts. Love is not about what is in the world&#39;s holy books. Love is about who two people can understand and accept one another... and then stand by each other, even when there are differences or when some feel that the union isn&#39;t right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clara then looked to each pair, &quot;Coming here to display that love respects that belief and makes it clear that for you... your love is for your respective partner... who makes you happy. It would be my hope that you all remain happy as you move forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will,&quot; Ella said, squeezing Simone&#39;s paw.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will,&quot; Herman promised to Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will,&quot; Moxie promised to Arlene, &quot;Right, Starla?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re lucky I love you,&quot; Arlene answered, &quot;and yes, we will.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It hadn&#39;t been the most elaborate wedding ever, but Clara was still happy to think back on it and hopped that all the pairs were happy with what they planned to do. They deserved that, and with those thoughts in mind, Clara went about her day.</p>
