<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel had her own ideas for what she intended to do going forward with some of this Muscle Tech-X.<br />
<br />
When she went to work that day, driving in her Honda Civic after dropping off Jeff at his own job, she decided to bring in about eighteen bottles of Muscle Tech-X to see what she could do with it. Considering she looked like a female bodybuilder at this rate, she was curious what might happen if someone went with a bigger than recommended dose. It seemed there was some knowledge of what might happen floating around with Krauss and her two muscle-bound friends...and if there was anything Rachel hated, it was being kept out of the loop. So even though he knew it was probably not the best idea, she just HAD to find out for herself.<br />
<br />
She doubted it was anything too severe. They were being really coy about it rather than severe. Maybe it was something beyond what even Rachel had experienced so far. Such was why she felt she needed to test it out and see what happened. Thus, if someone asked, she decided to omit the part about only using one dosage. See where people went with it.<br />
<br />
As far as her job, Rachel worked at a local swimming pool as a technician. She handled any of the technical issues that might come up with any of the equipment, the pool mechanisms, the locker room, and lights. There was very little that successfully pissed her off quite like assuming someone with a good handle on their fitness - like her - was just some braindead bimbo. And in fact, related to that, there was someone at work she had a particular eye on for such treatment.<br />
<br />
As she entered the building after parking her car and carrying in her eighteen bottles in a small cooler container, she immediately got some compliments on her new look from both regular swimmers and the lifeguards. Ah yes, another bonus of the work here was getting to see both rather hunky swimmers and the phenomenally attractive lifeguards. Now, she had no intention of cheating on Jeff - none at all - but she just as well enjoyed the sights, so to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Rachel? You&#39;re looking great these days. Whatever you&#39;re doing, keep it up,&quot; Trevor Castle said. Trevor was one of the more vapid male lifeguards. He had disheveled, long blond hair, blue eyes, tanned skin and a muscular, tight and toned build. He was still very nice, just not exactly the brightest - though when it came to leaping into action as a lifeguard he was quite gifted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna know how I do it?&quot; She teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing!&quot; Oh, that got his attention. Ah, Trevor, always looking for a neat new pre-workout...<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably just by hanging around her buddies at 20 Fitness till some bodybuilder decided to give her some gym candy,&quot; a brief laugh, and then the individual continued, walking out on his way to the lockers, &quot;Real lifters stay natural.&quot; Sure Greg, sure. Gregory Ellison was the aforementioned lovely individual. As far as Greg was concerned, she was a bimbo who lucked into every single solution for the issues at hand.<br />
<br />
Greg was heavily muscled, wore his black hair in a military chic cut - something like a crew cut, and often wore sunglasses over his hazel colored eyes. Despite the military hardass image he projected, he was the son of a very wealthy family - but apparently he had some kind of strange military fantasy he lived vicariously through. And as much as Greg talked up being natural, the way his stomach looked and his oversized trapezius muscles...well, it put the lie to his word.<br />
<br />
As Rachel contemplated how she could get Greg to be her lab rat, she saw Eli Durham walking up to her. Eli was the head lifeguard, 35 instead of the 20-somethings that staffed most of the pool. He was very well muscled, though rather lacking in tone at the midsection. His dirty blond hair had a small gray bang hanging near his temple, and even though he was slightly wrinkled already, Rachel just thought it gave him a more established, &quot;older guy&quot; kind of handsome. &quot;Don&#39;t let Greg get to you. I think you&#39;re doing marvelously.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great to see you too, Eli,&quot; Rachel said, wondering if she could manage to get Eli on the Muscle Tech, and what result it might have. Though she was conflicted as she didn&#39;t want to injure or somehow affect her best friend / boss. &quot;I&#39;m not. I just brought some refreshments today from the gym. Tell everybody on staff that they can feel free to take a bottle or two, however much they feel like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sounds lovely, I&#39;ll send word around. In fact I&#39;ve been meaning to get kind of refreshed, could I get one for the road? May need it for later in the shift.&quot; Eli said with a smile, not even knowing what was to come. Rachel thought about it, and ultimately gave Eli one of them. She just figured if she decided against it, she would only let him have that one.<br />
<br />
As she started heading to work, she saw one more person on her &quot;people to change&quot; list. Daron Richmond, aka, &quot;Little Greg&quot;. Daron worked for Greg&#39;s family, and the pale little fucker was more tall, svelte and lean than the others so far. Daron wore his ginger hair in a mess on his head. He was technically Greg&#39;s &quot;assistant&quot;. Whereas Greg usually contented himself during the day trying to get laid with some of the female lifeguards, it didn&#39;t take a genius to notice green eyed Daron&#39;s homoerotic fixation on Greg. He tried his hardest to be exactly like Greg, though from what Rachel heard from the female lifeguards, he was an awful lay. Probably because his erection was forever pointed at Greg.<br />
<br />
Daron was just...glaring at her. Watching. Observing...and then he hurried off to do whatever Greg had him doing. Much as Rachel disliked the idea of giving Daron or Greg more muscle to use, the fact was, whatever it was Muscle Tech-X also did to people...she wanted to know. And who better to test it on than two people she really didn&#39;t care for?<br />
<br />
As Rachel got to her office and started reviewing what her job today was due to be, she put down her refreshments by her desk, in full view of anyone going by. She already knew Eli was due to use a bottle, but as she headed out, she looked forward to seeing who went too far with it. And what might happen when they did.</p>
