My notes to me<br />
So, everything has been just great with the goddamn keepers here. They took one look at me and freaked out asking who, what, when and where. Kizo was right about how dumb humans are, and none of them asked why. So, good news is that the time of opening is up has been delayed by 3 more days, so five days from today. They separated me from Kizo because they don’t want us getting &quot;intimate&quot; with each other. They had me do a test for pregnancy and happily enough it was positive, so I might still stay with him after all. They put me in a cage with a stone tablet so I’m basically using it as a journal as best I can. At least until Kizo wakes up from his slumber.<br />
<br />
________<br />
<br />
You sighed, it had been one day since you&#39;ve been like this and already you’re miserable. However it’s not for the fact that your an animal, but rather the fact that you want to be with Kizo. Luckily your cage was next to his, so you could still talk to him. If there was anything remotely positive about your separation from him it was that you finally had room to stretch your wings.<br />
<br />
Moments later a deep bellowing yawn grabbed your attention and you smiled as this signified that your mate was stirring. You looked over and watched Kizo stand up then shake himself awake and stretch his wings. Kizo looked over to you with always eyes and said,&quot;Good morning, I guess, I hate that they separated us like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but until I start showing signs then there’s nothing that we can do about it. But on a happier note, I tested positive for pregnancy.&quot; You said then smiled at him, but it was a nervous smile and Kizo seemed to notice this. &quot;Hey, why do you seem nervous about this? It’s wonderful is it not?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then sighed and said,&quot;Sorry, it’s just....I am still not used to things and now I might be pregnant. Do you realize how painful that will be for me to handle.&quot; Kizo laughed at this then he replied,&quot;Tis mostly just bliss, I remember being part of my mother’s kin while she layed her final clutch. In later years she said it was pure bliss to the point where she didn’t want to stop.&quot; You paused at this and blushed with your eyes wide and Kizo then grinned at you and said,&quot;Also I know a small trick with these cages, so technically we aren’t really separated.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and cocked your head to the side confused then you watched Kizo walk over to a large door of the cage then he looked to the large latch that was holding his door shut, just like the door on your cage. Kizo looked over to you and said,&quot;Go ahead and try, I&#39;ve been doing this for years.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and you walked up to the large door of your cage and tried to reach through to the latch. However you’re claws were too large for the gap and Kizo watched you struggle for a bit then he chuckled then he turned his back to his door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, most try that but don’t notice this obvious flaw.&quot; Kizo exclaimed then you watched him and you saw his tail lift up off the ground. The space between the bars was just enough to get the tip of his tail through the bars and you saw the latch slowly lifting up off of the ground. Throughout all of this Kizo looked like he was using a lot of strength to do this, but eventually he overpowered the latch and it fell over onto the ground with a loud clanging sound.<br />
<br />
You then looked at Kizo, who was out of breath from the experience. &quot;There...heh....It’s definitely nice to get out of the same hole of piss and feces that I have to deal with, and sleep in. Now, let’s get you out of your hole there.&quot; Kizo said and you watched him in awe of what he did then you looked at your tail. Kizo then made his way over to your latch and he lifted it up with ease then he opened your door and smiled at you. &quot;Hello again, my love, where were we now?&quot; Kizo asked taking a seat on the other side of your opened cage door.<br />
<br />
You smiled at your mate then walked up to him and nuzzled him and said,&quot;Probably about to shove your dragon meat somewhere between my lips. But do you think we have time for a round of that?&quot; <br />
<br />
Kizo smiled at me and nodded,&quot;It’s barely dawn, so I&#39;d say yes. Let’s pump that womb of yours full of eggs.&quot; You smiled walking out of your cage and you brushed Kizo&#39;s muzzle with your tail while doing so then you grinned and said,&quot;Dominate me so we&#39;ll stay together my love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without another word Kizo mounted you as he did when you first transformed and his cock entered your cunt so naturally now. Kizo began humping you to his heart&#39;s content and you took it like the dragoness slut you were. You wanted every moment of this wild animal lust of yours, and every moment of it was blissful to you. Kizo cupped your breasts from above and pinched your sensitive nipples causing you to growl and moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;More, I want to feel it all again!&quot; You growled and Kizo began ramming you harder and more vigorously. His cock throbbed inside of you and both of you orgasmed many times before you both let out yet another roar of climax and triumph before Kizo dismounted you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love this version of you infinitely to your human one.&quot; Kizo commented after he dismounted you. You looked back at him and smiled at him, and then you felt his slick, thin forked tongue against your pussy lips and you let out a satisfying moan. &quot;Oh Kizo....you know how to make this dragon feel loved and dirty at the same time.&quot; You said and Kizo chuckled and replied,&quot;Just cleaning up the evidence for you.&quot; You then felt Kizo take another long lick out of your clit and moaned louder and blushed then you turned towards him and grinned at him seductively then said,&quot;Then let me return the favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kizo smiled then layed down on his side then you layed down too with your face in his crotch then you took a lick out of his dick. Kizo moaned loudly as you licked up the cum that was left on it causing it to spurt out more and you laughed then licked that up too. You then got a naughty idea and you closed your mouth around his large cock then began sucking.<br />
<br />
Kizo moaned louder and growled as you continued to suck and eventually he orgasmed letting out a roar as well as a load of his seed into your mouth. You took a moment to swallow then you layed down in front of Kizo and the two of you smiled at one another for a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; You said to him then Kizo replied,&quot;I love you too, so how did I taste my love?&quot; You grinned at him then I wrapped my front claws around him and said,&quot;You’re about to find out for yourself.&quot; You then kissed Kizo and he kissed you back now and your tongues entered each other’s muzzles just as naturally as his dick did your vagina.<br />
<br />
As you kissed you caught hints of other stuff in Kizo&#39;s mouth, perhaps it was left over meat, or maybe you were tasting your own juices that were still left sitting inside of his maw. Kizo didn’t fight at all, and he embraced you as much as your bodies could allow you to do so before you stopped and looked at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I like that taste.&quot; Kizo said then he nuzzled the tip of your muzzle with his and you replied,&quot;You tasted amazing as well. But what’s not to share between lovers?&quot; Kizo smiled then he said,&quot;Exactly, also have you not seen your breasts?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused not quite sure what he was talking about at first then Kizo pinched the nipple on one and it spurted out a tiny bit of milk that landed on his face. You moaned at first, but then blushed and laughed as you saw it land on him and he laughed too. &quot;Milk is the first sign, your breasts have begun to swell my love. Your stomach will follow soon at a moderate pace. However none of this happens in a single day, so we must be patient and wait. Would you like to perhaps go out on a walk later tonight? There’s no guards around, so we don’t have to worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused for a moment then asked,&quot;Tonight? Why aren’t there guards?&quot; Kizo smiled then responded,&quot;Why, because they trust us to defend ourselves. Wether it be me with my....unique transformation ability or my fire, or the pixies with their tender little magic dust. We can defend ourselves, and tonight we can see what all of the other creatures are doing.&quot; You paused for a moment looking at Kizo then you looked around the cave and you made your decision. <br />
<br />
<br />
It was to....</p>
