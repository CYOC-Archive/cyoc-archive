<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moans from Megan and Jenny outside the door was enough for the Chapmans to have reason to think they could get away from the master bedroom that they&#39;d largely been trapped in since the previous night. Jeff&#39;s decision to complete his transformation, in that sense had that as an additional positive effect to solving the issues on how to get help regarding Edward Cupple, the man ultimately behind everything the family had gone through. Though as Jeff looked out the window and then down the vertical surface that was the outer wall of the house, his mother and sisters could sense some wonder and nervousness as he did so, which made sense given that they&#39;d had the same worries when they moved to rescue Jeff from Megan and Jenny earlier.<br />
<br />
In a way, it was understandable, as neither mundane slugs nor Slug People were known for jumping, which made the distance to the ground look more formidable. Stories from the few Humans over the years that had fallen in love with a Slug Person and willingly joined them also raised points in which Human instinct and abilities often interfered with confidence in their new abilities as Slug People. They&#39;d see the slime they produced as a means to help them move without legs and thus figured that would leave things rather slippery and thus a vertical surface could be considered rather challenging for the new Slug Person. Jeff had to be having those worries now.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can go down the side of the house safely?&quot; Jeff asked as he brought his head shoulders back into the master bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Zoe playfully punched him the shoulder, &quot;how do you think Megan and Jenny were able to get to the outside part of the window? How do you think we were able to get and chase them off? Now that you&#39;re a Slug Man, you can do it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And at the same time,&quot; Grace picked up, &quot;while our slime helps us move... it&#39;s more that it eases the sort of tension one might otherwise feel on one&#39;s tail, it doesn&#39;t make us slip. Partially as since our tails are pretty much all muscle as all our &quot;human&quot; anatomy is still in our heads and torsos going down to the waist... our tails will actually generate a sort of suction effect on the wall and the slime helps secure that. So things should be fine. In some ways... just let instinct take over and you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff slowly and to a degree hesitantly nodded and then began to climb out the window. He kept one eye stalk focused on the wall and then down to the ground, looking to make sure he wouldn&#39;t fall into anything that would be sharp or pointy, and the other on his mother and siblings. Things seemed okay and he got a sense of encouragement from them, which was good and it eased his worries. The exit from the master bedroom through the window went fine, and while he did slide a little bit, it was only a couple of inches before his tail seemed to have a grip of the sides of the house. This actually got him to look back over his shoulder to his family.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m doing it!&quot; Jeff stated, &quot;I&#39;m outside the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, though please keep going,&quot; Lucy instructed, &quot;we don&#39;t know how long Megan and Jenny will be distracted... and it will probably take most of the day to get the help needed to deal with Cupple and be able to be safe in our own home again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff submitted to that, as he had the sense that Lucy was serious and in some ways he agreed with her. It was part of the overall plan that they&#39;d worked out as a family. So he made his way down the wall and drifted over to a side to go around the window on the first floor that was just below the master bedroom window that he&#39;d exited. When he reached the grass of the lawn, he soon felt a bit of a tickling sensation as his tail made contact with it, and he looked up to see Lucy and Grace then following him. Whitney was just coming out through the window while Zoe was the last one inside. Jeff moved far enough away that his family could join him and he also noted their eyes widen a bit when their tails touched the grass.<br />
<br />
&quot;The grass tickles,&quot; Grace said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably going to say on how sensitive our tails are,&quot; Whitney commented, &quot;they can feel most everything...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So no one giggle,&quot; Zoe commented as she reached the ground before a male voice spoke from behind you and startled you a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or run off,&quot; a male voice said from behind Jeff, making him turn around.<br />
<br />
First his eyes turned around to look behind him. He soon saw a lone man there and then heard gasps from his mother and sisters as he began to turn the rest of his body around. The man looked a bit frustrated with something but not necessarily lacking confidence. In this, Jeff was certain this had to be Edward Cupple and he moved to put his body between the warlock and his family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Edward Cupple, I presume,&quot; Jeff said to the man who then managed a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, I am,&quot; Cupple answered, &quot;and I am pleased that you decided to conform with my plans... you&#39;ll make a good partner for what I have planned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could feel some attempt of &quot;hypnotizing&quot; him through the way Cupple spoke in his mind, but at the same time he felt the collective resistance from his mother and sisters. In that, the only effect that Cupple really had on him was a minor ache that was easily resisted. Jeff glared back with narrowed eyes at the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should now by now that you can&#39;t twist our minds,&quot; Jeff answered, &quot;and yes... my family told me about their run in with you. And I won&#39;t let you hurt them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my boy,&quot; Edward Cupple forced a smile, &quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt them. I need them and you. Hurting them would hurt many of my plans... but if you won&#39;t see reason and follow my commands, I can take other actions that would allow me to get my primary objectives. And your mother did tell you about the discipline I provided when she wanted to try and punch me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t move, and could feel the anger and fear coming from his mother and sisters. It gave him a sense that they were willing to charge him outright as punishment for what had happened earlier. However, Jeff didn&#39;t know exactly what else Cupple could do and for the moment didn&#39;t want to risk the lives of his sisters, particularly if Cupple had some kind of spell that was more powerful than the weak blast of lightning that Cupple had used to stun Whitney. That only left Cupple to smile again.<br />
<br />
&quot;See...&quot; Cupple smirked to Whitney and Lucy, &quot;I don&#39;t need to enslave you... There may be a bit to many of you as a group to bend you to my will, but I have other means to ensure you obey. For, you&#39;ve already lost one family member. Do I have to harm others before you obey me?&quot;</p>
