<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next week Sarah and Eric met up every day on the way to school, and, across that day they would separately make sure to check out all of &quot;the infected&quot; as they dubbed them. Usually reporting any findings over lunch together.<br />
<br />
Kimi overdressed for the week, quiet and keeping to herself. Though always with a pleased grin on her face.<br />
<br />
Cal and Kiara both took the week off, no doubt co-inciding with her husband&#39;s business trip.<br />
<br />
Brooke dialled up the bitchy to new heights, but always looked like something was bothering her. Particularly always shifting and adjusting her pants.<br />
<br />
Amber on the other hand toned down the snooty act, instead seeming introspective and keeping to herself.<br />
<br />
It was the twins surprisingly, who if you knew their secret, seemed the most reckless and least perturbed by any body changes. Watching them carefully, Sarah and Eric saw them holding hands, playing footsie, popping in and out of janitors closets with wide excited grins, and disappearing into the woods bordering the school. None of it was super blatant, but they weren&#39;t being ultra cautious though.<br />
<br />
It seemed they were already risk takers in personality, and tweaking their inhibitions on the Chronivac had pushed them into all out reckless.<br />
<br />
Sitting down to lunch one day the two compared observations, all while a horny rat mutant munched happily on an apple nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Saw Carmen... *pppftt*&quot;, Sarah blew a strand of curly frizzy ginger hair from her face, &quot;Carmen&#39;s ears peeking through her hair, they definitely a bit bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric swallowed a big bite, &quot;Yeah... Saw the same. The twins have to be noticing by now right?&quot; He asked. Sarah glanced up and over his shoulder at the table containing the them.<br />
<br />
She watched them for a few moments, &quot;Well Jorge just played with her ear and they both laughed. They definitely know, and they&#39;re defo not bothered so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric speared some more food on his fork. &quot;Mad how they don&#39;t seem bothered... At least all the rest seem at least in one way or another a bit put out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah snorted, &quot;Except Amber, she&#39;s barely holding it in.&quot;. Eric arched his eye and looked over at Amber, she was furtively picking at her own food. &quot;Just looks a bit nervous to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah&quot; Sarah drummed her fingers on the table, &quot;her mouth keeps turning to a grin ever few seconds. I bet she&#39;s excited to get home. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she went full horse willingly straight away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think so?&quot; Eric quizzed, intrigued. <br />
<br />
Sarah stopped drumming, thinking for a moment. &quot;Yeah...&quot; She continued drumming, &quot;Strikes me as the type that is so totally obsessed with horses that she&#39;d actually be excited by being able to fuck one.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hah&quot; Eric laughed, &quot;you&#39;re damn good at reading people&quot;. He looked over at Amber, eating her food, not making a fuss or looking to him, any way perturbed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wanna wager?&quot; He suggested. Sarah made an interested face, &quot;First one to go off the deep end, I say the twins here.&quot; He thumbed back at the two giggling twins.<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s face scrunched in thought for a few moments, she looked around again at each of them. Then said. &quot;What&#39;s the bet?&quot; Eric grinned and suggested, &quot;how about winner picks the next Chronivac change... Obviously no picking the other person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah looked very interested now. &quot;I um.. yeah, okay. Deal!&quot; She held out her hand, which Eric shook.<br />
<br />
Their lunch was interrupted at that point by the rat, having finished its food coming over and insisting on being fucked. Throwing itself on the table in front of Eric it held its rat pussy open with its paws, smelly grool dribbling on to the table. Eric immediately turned rock hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bizarre how the Chronivac works. No one&#39;s batting an eyelid&quot; Sarah remarked as Eric unzipped, and lined himself up with the excitedly gibbering Rat. &quot;You should feel honored you&#39;re exempt&quot;. He grunted, thrusting himself into the delighted Rat.<br />
<br />
Sarah eyed the two fucking for a moment, &quot;well... I do get to see my bitch of a sister reduce herself to an animal. And get to see my kinks play out in reality. So yeah... Suppose I am.&quot; She concluded, sighed, and picking up her tray, left the canteen.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Sarah observed carefully over the next few days. The twins, Kimi, Amber, and Brooke all. She failed to track down Cal and Kiara however. <br />
<br />
She was good at observation, that wasn&#39;t a exaggeration by Eric. That and her computer smarts were the reason she knew so much about people.<br />
<br />
A remote hack on Kimi&#39;s phone showed she&#39;d taken some photos of herself in the school cubicle, top pulled up, and panties pulled down, tagged. &quot;Look how crazy puffy I got thinking of u!&quot;. Her pussy was swollen and juicy, her teats puffed with chunky nipples. Another had her with her arms pressing her tits into a solid cleavage, tagged. &quot;So much bigger 2day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Considering how slight and underdeveloped Kimi had been, Sarah knew that the changes were working on her.<br />
<br />
The twins texts didn&#39;t give away much more than that they were mad into fucking, and deeply in love. The only thing that seemed on point was one message from Jorge which said, &quot;Don&#39;t shave today, the fuzz is totally hot, can&#39;t wait to stick my face into it.&quot; She did also know that the two were religious condom users, and therefore more likely to change slower than others.<br />
<br />
Brooke&#39;s pussy had started to change colour to glossy black, which spooked her into thinking she had an STD, and stopped her in her tracks from messing with her dog. Sarah found that out from her internet searches. She hadn&#39;t gotten the guts yet to go to the doctor, or tell anyone yet, so she was stalled.<br />
<br />
Amber though, Sarah was glad she&#39;d bet on her. The girl kept a video diary which Sarah had full access to. It was always from her bedroom, her sitting on her bed, talking to a propped up phone. Up till now it had been Amber, prim and proper, talking inane babble about what it was like caring for and grooming a horse, real boring stuff.<br />
Her latest videos, however, were staring to change. The first thing Sarah noticed one day was that Amber had her hair down into long cascading waves, spilling over her shoulders, chest and back. She always had her hair in a braid, so this was a serious departure from the norm. She also seemed more... Loose... Less uptight.<br />
<br />
Swaying and smiling she rambled a bit on how much she loved her horse, how lucky she was to have such a handsome gentle partner. She called him a complete gentleman when describing their trip out for the day and even slipped by calling him a &quot;stud&quot; once.<br />
<br />
At the end of the ramble that finished with, &quot;I&#39;m so lucky to have him... I think... Yeah...&quot; she paused and swayed for a moment, smiling and lost in her own personal joy. Noticing the camera eventually she reached to turn it off. Then paused a moment. Thinking. Then grinning mischievously she reached back and grabbed the base of her pyjama top and lifted to show her midriff. <br />
Her abs were popping, she was a fit girl, but that wasnt the standout feature. That was the two small A-cup breasts nestled above her crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m turning into his mare.&quot; She squealed, then dropped the hem. Looking at the camera she said, &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do... But I&#39;m so flipping turned on by this.&quot; Reaching into her pants she clearly went to masturbate and at the same time as ending the recording.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackpot&quot; grinned Sarah. Scooting the video back to the reveal, she took a screen grab of the happy girl showing off her crotch and saved it down, sending it on to Eric with a message, &#39;that bet is mine!&#39; and added a winky face.<br />
<br />
Her phone buzzed immediately and the response said, &#39;fuck that&#39;s hot. Gud call with Amber. U&#39;re damn smart.&#39;<br />
<br />
She grinned for a moment. Then dropped the smile, still hurting from him having gotten with her sister.<br />
Instead she was about to pull up her writing app and launch into her next piece, when her phone hack software pinged again.</p>
