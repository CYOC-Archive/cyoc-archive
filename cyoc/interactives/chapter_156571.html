<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David was in a fret, his genitals ruled his every desire. He having re-entered his house did go straightway to take a shower and be cleaned from the wild and sexual melee he had endured. As his Marla had aroused and caused minor injury to his goat cock, it was the big buck goat he had purchased for Marla what mounted Dave and did to him what the beast did several times to their mutual mate, Marla.<br />
<br />
Hot water eased the ache of a sore cock and did well to allow the vast volume of goat semen shot up as inside his sore butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why Marla, whatever behest you to want to worship that evil goddess?&quot; Dave grumbled as he stood scrubbing his outer bodily self clean.<br />
<br />
Worse yet, David thought about how he would live day to day, and whether his being changed about his genitals would enter him into feelings of wild desire to mate with his office secretaries.  The sudden disappearance of his wife he knew would be difficult to explain to their family and relatives. As worse, what would he do when the family physician would require David to take a full body physical. His future looked grim, but not as horrid as was that of his dear wife being transformed permanently of her alive and being a doe goat. Then again, what had the priestess said to him about how he must need live, or if he should ignore the changes done to him, the being as part goat might well consume him.<br />
<br />
When patted dry from having showered, Dave went directly to where Marla had her roll-top desk, he taking a seat with his bare butt, as began looking for a phone number to call. The phone number of the priestess Dave wanted, as Marla was in contact with her for info about future meetings of their coven. When he found a folder titled &quot;Friends of the Faith&quot; Dave discovered more than what he ever expected to find.<br />
<br />
Paging through the manila file, Dave read the written notes and even the minutes taken when she, his dear wife was the coven secretary.<br />
<br />
Dave read the minutes Marla wrote, as told of various hikers, campers, what ventured to find and greet the coven members, the priestess, and all met then the evil desires of the Goddess Bast. The tales written as what became of the foolish people meeting then Bast, had Dave feeling his goat cock rising to stand in an engrossed erect state. He read pages of written descriptions Marla wrote, she vivid with her telling of how human born people digressed physically, they becoming common farm animals, or forest beasts, but none ever retained their rational identities of their human lives.<br />
<br />
Marla commenting about the hikers turned into bears, she wrote, that the priestess was asked by a changing man, a father to his soon Bear family, requested to know if their being as forest Bears would be forever a permanent, the Priestess smiled and made mention that the Goddess used her powers to cause a change, and never felt any need to return what she deemed as properly doomed to being returned to a human form!<br />
<br />
That stated, and Marla wrote about the two mating Bears toyed, played, mated, and with their three cub Bears did amble away into the forest. Marla wrote about mountain goats, of sheep, as one man did request his becoming then damned, he doomed, preferred becoming as a Ram sheep with big balls and a purpose to mate, increasing the herd. The man got his wish and as if while he retained some of his past identity, he did try to molest, rape, mate, breed with the priestess.<br />
<br />
As of so many others who stumbled in on coven meetings, the coven members made requests of the Priestess, suggesting to the dooming of the trespassing fools, that some become as horses, donkeys, and cattle, bulls mostly, but a few women hikers got to know what life is like for dairy cows.<br />
<br />
Dave wondered about what he read, as if those who were changed, transformed received cloven hoofs, and if due to their meeting the evil Goddess, cloven hoofs were her favorite form of footwear.<br />
<br />
Finally, after fumbling through the loge of papers in the file kept by Marla, Dave found the phone number he was searching to find.<br />
<br />
Dialing the number, hearing the phone ringing, a woman&#39;s voice answered with a terse sounding &quot;Hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave identified himself to the supposed Priestess. He reported to her of the exploits his goat wife Marla was enjoying, she mating with a buck goat he had bought for her to tickling her furry fantasies. Dave then had a question to ask, he wanting to know if his goat genitals were a permanent thing?<br />
<br />
Much to his horror, the Priestess laughed, and she informing then Dave that his dear wife was a member of the Bast goddess coven, but came to the worship meeting as sweaty, unwashed, and smelly. The Goddess took offense because Marla was stinky like an animal, she then became a smelly animal. Marla, her membership with the coven ceased when she became a doe goat. The Goddess having so cursed, transforming a vile member to the coven, never would invoke their return to being again as human or let such a person defile the purer senses of the Goddess. Marla became a doe goat and would for purposes of coven purity, she would remain a doe goat!<br />
<br />
&quot;So what of me and my male genitals being goat like, are they also as permanently to being goat buck cock, sheath, and scrotum?&quot; Dave sheepishly asked of the Priestess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Foolish man, your wife drew you to the coven meeting with her scheme to use you as a sacrifice, to enhance her standing with our goddess. As she failed to attain what she planned, you were touched by the same curse, gifting you a proper method for servicing your wife. You muddled your lifestyle and future by purchasing that big buck goat. Had you not bought Marla a buck goat mate, you, in due time would have known similar transference, changing slowly, retaining your mental indemnity, knowing yourself of being a buck goat, mating with Marla, as living a long life rich with sexual delights.<br />
<br />
Instead, and with much the same future, you shall continue to frolic with Marla, while changing physically, becoming more of form to be a male goat, as wanting to become a herd sire. The Goddess knows only of what she ultimately wanted for you to serve her wishes, and keep Marla horny and happy to remain a doe goat. Learn then to enjoy your animalistic new self, frolic jumping fences, find your favorite herd, and by next the New Year&#39;s eve begin living what you are with gusto!&quot; The Priestess said to Dave, to then cease the phone call. She hung up her phone and left Dave to wondering again about his beastly doom coming by the New year&#39;s eve party.</p>
