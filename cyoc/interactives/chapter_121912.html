<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Wow.  This one makes me concerned for my mental state...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">9 years ago, you set out on a quest.  A quest to become King of the Dragons.  During this time, you made many friends and enemies.  The enemies were wiped off the face of the plane, and the friends were rewarded.  Your power grew immeasurably, and you started to realize just who you were.  The one month journey was everything you&#39;d hoped it would be and more.  During that journey, there was one moment that you didn&#39;t know would change you as much as it did.  In the very beginning, you met a little girl dragon named Starfire.  She had no idea of who you were, the atrocities you&#39;d committed, and the ambitions that led you to her.  Yet, she still greeted you with a child-like innocence you found too adorable.  She wasn&#39;t a strong dragon, or a smart dragon, but she still grew on you.<br />
<br />
As the King of the Dragons, one of your duties was going from community to community, conversing with various dragons and  getting to know your subjects.  During one of these trips, you came across Starfire again.  She was basically the same as when you first met her.  The main thing was that she recognized you, and you recognized her.  She still had the same childish demeanor, and the same peppy personality.  At that point, you didn&#39;t know exactly what you wanted in life, aside from ascending to Godhood.  You felt empty inside.  To remedy this, you decided to ask her parents and community if you could raise her in your court.  Treat her like the little sister you needed in the Dragon Kingdom.  After pulling some strings, you brought her back to your keep in the capital of the Dragon Kingdom.<br />
<br />
After living with her for quite some time, you remembered another detail about your meeting her.  She was in a community of old, sick, and disabled dragons.  You didn&#39;t want to ask about this, but you wondered why.  Then, you realized exactly why.  She was incapable of using magic.  Dragons were the pinnacle of magical talent.  All races of dragons had some proficiency in magic.  Her race, the Bluefire Dragons, had exceptional mastery over the element of Fire.  Yet, she had none.  After realizing this, you made a vow to protect her at all costs.  You almost considered her family, and wanted to make sure she was safe.  That was 7 years ago, by Kelper standards of time.<br />

October 1, 2017<br />
<br />
&quot;So Brother.  What do you want to do today?&quot;  You asked Rowan.  You gave New York one more week to exist, so you needed to use that week wisely.  &quot;I&#39;m thinking it might be a good idea to get some more followers in the city.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That does seem like a good idea.  More followers traveling around the city means even more followers.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;Not that having followers changes our significance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s for show.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;What&#39;s the point of ruling the multiverse if nobody knows who&#39;s ruling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed.&quot;  A familiar voice added.  You turned to the couch next to you and saw a familiar winged figure.  It was the Archdemon.  &quot;Hello Tyrells.  Long time no see!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Zebulon!&quot;  You smiled, greeting the demon.  &quot;It&#39;s truly been a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.  I hear you&#39;ve been promoted Gannoth, or should I say Adrian.&quot;  The demon smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Zebulon.&quot;  You chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what brings you here?&quot;  Rowan asked.  &quot;How did you even find us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I heard that you&#39;d learned true interplanar travel, and I figured that you&#39;d come to your former familiar&#39;s home plane.&quot;  Zebulon explained.  &quot;Once I got here, I just followed your magical aura.  It really wasn&#39;t difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For someone like you, it really wouldn&#39;t be.&quot;  Rowan laughed.  &quot;So just stopping by to say hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, aside from congratulating you on starting your planar conquest, I have a message concerning you, Adrian.&quot;  Zebulon stated, turning towards you.  &quot;You might want to check back on your kingdom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did something happen?&quot;  You asked, starting to become concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to get into details here, as I fear what might become of you.&quot;  Zebulon stated.  &quot;Please go back.  Izedin will explain everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.  Brother, I&#39;ll be back shortly.&quot;  You said, before changing into your royal attire and disappearing into a wisp of black energy.  When you arrived in Kitria, you started frantically looking for Izedin.<br />
<br />
&quot;My King!&quot;  The large red dragon yelled.  &quot;I have terrible news for you.&quot;  You immediately rushed towards Izedin.  To the untrained eye, it looked like you teleported.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot;  You asked, looking up to the much larger dragon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It concerns Starfire.&quot;  He started.  &quot;She...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHERE IS SHE!!&quot;  You yelled.  &quot;Tell me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My King.  I&#39;ve never seen you like this.&quot;  Izedin said, starting to look terrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is she.&quot;  You said, much calmer but still intimidating.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d rather not have you see.&quot;  Izedin started hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am your king.  You will do as I say.&quot;  You spoke angrily.  &quot;Take me to her now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course My King.&quot;  Izedin whimpered, almost scared to follow the order.  &quot;Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you want what is best for me, but my word is still final.&quot;  You chided.  &quot;And if it concerns Starfire...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, My King.&quot;  Izedin begged.  &quot;Listen to me.  What you are about to see is terrible.  This just happened yesterday.  We begged the Archdemon to relay you the message to come here, as he was the only one powerful enough to travel the planes we could contact.&quot;  Izedin led you to the field you used to play with Starfire in.  In it, you saw Starfire laying in a pool full of blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why wasn&#39;t anyone protecting her.&quot;  You started angrily.  &quot;WHY WASN&#39;T ANYONE WITH HER!!!!  She- she couldn&#39;t protect herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My King.  We were supervising her when we spotted a group of mysterious people.  We went to investigate, but it left her completely unguarded.  We didn&#39;t communicate correctly.  Despite being gone for less than one minute, they had enough time to attack Starfire and escape.  We&#39;ve sent dragons throughout the whole continent trying to find who was responsible for this.  As of now, we have apprehended those responsible for the murder, and who ordered it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Izedin.&quot;  You said softly.  &quot;Now leave before anything happens to you.&quot;  Izedin flew away faster than he&#39;d ever flown before.  &quot;This shouldn&#39;t have happened.  This is my fault.&quot;  You started crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adrian!&quot;  You heard Rowan.  You looked back and saw your brother running towards you.  &quot;Isn&#39;t this the dragon you basically adopted as a sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;  You forced through the tears.  &quot;This happened because of me!  I wasn&#39;t there to protect her.  I wasn&#39;t there to save her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Adrian.&quot;  Rowan started.  &quot;This is not your fault.  We&#39;ll find those responsible and make them pay for their actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No punishment is harsh enough for this.&quot;  You cried.  &quot;Eternal torture is too lenient for a crime like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get the people responsible for this, and you can take your anger out on them in any way you desire.  Is that okay?&quot;  Rowan asked, wanting you to feel better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring them to the Plane of Plains.&quot;  You said, trying to end the tears.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to do anything in front of her.  She never knew the evil side of me.  I don&#39;t want her to see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course brother.&quot;  Rowan said, hugging you before leaving towards the draconic city that was your capital.  You hugged the corpse of Starfire, crying into the stab wound you noticed right by her heart.  You couldn&#39;t muster any words for how you felt.  You could only cry.  You knew that even with your godly power, you couldn&#39;t resurrect her.  Now, you wished you could.  It angered you that even with your power, you couldn&#39;t do anything.  After one final hug, you disappeared in a wisp of black energy again.  All you left was a note, asking to give her a proper draconic funeral.<br />
<br />
The Plane of Plains.  Essentially, it&#39;s an entire plane of existence consisting of only one large plain.  If you want to see the destructive capabilities of something, but don&#39;t want to destroy anything, go to the Plane of Plains.  When you arrived at the plane, you noticed Rowan with a group of people.  They were bound and gagged.  With a snap of your fingers, you removed the gags.  &quot;Why did you kill Starfire?&quot;  You asked the group.  One man just spit at you.  Fueled by your anger, you grabbed his head and crushed his skull in your hand.  Blood and brain splattered everywhere.  &quot;Why did you kill Starfire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that the name of the little dragon girl?&quot;  One man asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT DOESN&#39;T ANSWER MY QUESTION!&quot;  You boomed, feeling the entire plane shake.  &quot;WHY DID YOU KILL HER!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really think we had it out against her?&quot;  The same man asked.  &quot;The Gods are angry.  They wish to end your reign, Rowan.  They want to dispose of you and your pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am no pet.&quot;  You started.  &quot;You say your Gods want us dead?  Your disgusting Gods?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Adrian?&quot;  Rowan asked, starting to look worried.  &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something I wish I had done a long time ago.&quot;  You said, before disappearing into another wisp of black energy.<br />
<br />
You reappeared in a large, white room.  Surrounding you were many different figures of various look.  Muscular men, old men, Amazon women, old scholars, and more.  You were in Elysia, the plane of the Gods.  One person, a middle aged-looking man, was in the center, and he started speaking.  &quot;Adrian Tyrell.  New brother of Rowan, the dark, demonic sorcerer.  You finally reveal yourself to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn&#39;t smart of you.&quot;  A man said cockily.  This was Huren, the god of the hunt.  &quot;You don&#39;t have any demons to protect you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;  You chided.  &quot;You caused my brother and me too much trouble.  You Gods sent a warrior after us.  A warrior who has failed every attempt made against us.  I&#39;ve decided to end it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s one sorcerer to tens of Gods?&quot;  The center God, Batrone, God of Light, stated.  &quot;You cannot win.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;  A feeble voice echoed.  It was Colarus, the God of Knowledge.  &quot;I knew this day would come.  Just like the prophecy that I saw foretelling the coming of Rowan, I saw another.  Many years ago, I foresaw that there would be a war between the forces of the demons and the forces of the Gods.  In the end, Rowan would decide the victory for the demons, and we&#39;d all perish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not happening.&quot;  You stated, gritting your teeth.  &quot;I&#39;m here to kill you.  There will be no war, no demons.  Just me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you understand just how unmatched you are?&quot;  Parelia, the Goddess of Magic, asked.  With a single flick of your wrist, you send a bolt of dark magic directly toward her.  She blocked it with her own magic, but it seemed to take a lot of effort.  &quot;I should be asking you the same.  However, I just have one question.  Why did you kill Starfire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of my followers wanted to hunt a dragon.&quot;  Huren started, still with his cocky attitude.  &quot;I guided them to a clearing with a rather weak dragon, and they hunted it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was like a sister to me.&quot;  You cried, starting to become truly infuriated.  You started to morph into the Angel of Death.  &quot;You have no idea of the wrath you have just incurred.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a sorcerer to us Gods?&quot;  Another god laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That bolt almost killed me.&quot;  Parelia yelled.  &quot;He&#39;s ruthlessly strong!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you still blocked it!&quot;  Huren yelled at the goddess.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is a sorcerer to the Gods.&quot;  You laughed.  &quot;Is that how you feel about me?&quot;  You raised your arms up, black energy surrounding both.  Below you, the ground began to shake and crumble.  &quot;What am I to the Gods?  I&#39;ll tell you.  A God.&quot;  Slowly, bolts of pure black energy started to fly in all directions.  Some hit various Gods and Angels.  Many of them were injured or even killed.  After some time, the ground began to split, and the foundation of Elysia started to break.  Elysia was being destroyed.  &quot;You Gods, so high and mighty.  You never thought you&#39;d see the day of your death.  Prepare for it.&quot;  With one swift motion, the ground disappeared, and the whole plane was shrouded in black, dark energy.  Explosions, destruction, and mayhem ensued in the ocean of darkness.  When you dismissed it, nothing remained.  No Gods, no land, nothing.  It was as if the plane itself never existed.  All that was left was energy.  Energy you absorbed into your being.  You felt yourself gaining untold power.  Once you were finished, you returned to Rowan, who was on the ground panting in the Plane of Plains.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do Adrian?&quot;  Rowan asked, panting.  &quot;I felt a random surge of energy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You.  Hunters of Huren.&quot;  You turned towards the hunters you were holding captive.  &quot;Your precious God is dead.  Along with the rest of them.  The plane of Elysia is no more.&quot;  This shocked the hunters and Rowan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adrian!  What did you do!&quot;  Rowan yelled in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I killed the Gods.  I killed the angels.  I destroyed Elysia and all things divine.  Then, I absorbed their power.&quot;  You explained with a cold expression on your face.  &quot;You hunters, prepare to meet your fate at the hands of the man more powerful than all of your Gods combined.&quot;  Rowan collapsed on the ground in shock as you destroyed all existence of the hunters.  You picked your brother and returned to the site of Starfire&#39;s murder.  When you arrived, you noticed some dragons preparing for her funeral.  You halted them and walked towards the corpse.  You put your hands on her back.  They started to glow white.  After a minute, she started moving.  You resurrected her.  &quot;Call off the funeral.  She&#39;s back to life.&quot;<br />
