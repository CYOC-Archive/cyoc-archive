<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel&#39;s jaw dropped, gazing at her new self in the mirror.  The rational part of her wanted to scream, to call for help, but another part, a part she didn&#39;t even realize she&#39;d had, was slowly becoming alive.  As insane as it was, she found herself in love with her new body.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...Beautiful,&quot; she thought aloud, surprised to find how low her voice had become.  She posed in the mirror, sticking out her inflated rear and jutting her breasts.  She smiled experimentally, the small signs of aging adding a new maturity to her face.  The lines in her forehead were slightly more prominent, and the smallest of smile wrinkles had grown around her eyes.  She giggled, a seductive sound that she found arousing in its own right.<br />
<br />
She continued to make kissy faces in the mirror for a time, her plump red limps pursing naughtily.  Her long brown hair brushed the top of her rump, surprising her slightly.  She ran a dainty hand through the main, caressing the silky strands as they slid over her fingers.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m hotter than mom ever was...&quot; she sighed dreamily, relishing her new look.  She ran a hand over her toned midsection, feeling the bumps of her prominent abs.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hell, I&#39;m more fit than mom ever was, too.  Weird, I&#39;ve always been more of a snacker than her.  Maybe that&#39;s what having a kid does to you.&quot;  <br />
<br />
She continued to rub her hard tummy when, quite suddenly, a loose bit of flesh caught between her fingers.  Surprised, Rachel rubbed her abs, trying to surmise where the sudden bit of flab had come from.  As she ran her hands over her tummy, she found herself grabbing more and more wedges of doughy flesh.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; She started to panic, but was reminded of the whole absurdity of her situation in the first place.  She took a moment to gather her thoughts as the definition of her abs began to fade.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you like the perfume is doing to you, Rachel...no need to freak out.  It made you, well, whatever you are now.  If it&#39;s not done, then there&#39;s no point in trying to stop it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel?!&quot; She heard a voice shout from outside the bathroom door.  She froze, not knowing what to say.  &quot;Rachel, you&#39;ve been in their a pretty long time, sweetie.  Hurry it up, you&#39;re not the only person in this house, y&#39;know.&quot;<br />
<br />
She tried her best to raise the pitch of her new voice.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Just a second, mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
She heard footsteps leaving the hall outside of the bathroom.  Her heart thumping in her chest, she turned back to the mirror.  Sure enough, her abs had completely disappeared, leaving her with a doughy midsection, dangerously close to a full on potbelly.  She had to remind herself that the perfume must know what it was doing.  <br />
<br />
Her hips seemed to be widening as well.  Her hands shot to her waist as she felt her bones shifting under her skin.  It didn&#39;t hurt, but the sensation was definitely less than comfortable.  She moaned softly as her hips continued to expand outwards, her legs thickening up to match.  The gap between her thighs disappeared, and her butt seemed to be filling with jelly as it plumped up and bounced enthusiastically.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m starting to look like I&#39;ve had a few...&quot; Rachel didn&#39;t speak the last word out of sheer terror.  To say the word &#39;children&#39; would be to admit that her negative feelings about these new changes were accurate.<br />
<br />
Her perky breasts expanded as well, slowly beginning to sag against the constraint of her bikini.  Underneath her flesh, she could feel a rush of warm liquid fill up her mammaries.  Milk.  It had to be milk.  Her nipples grew as well, stretching outwards against the tight fabric of the bikini.  To dark circles appeared on the bikini in the spots covering her nipples.  Rachel had to bite her tongue to hold back a scream.<br />
<br />
Her long hair lost its well-maintained look in exchange for something a bit more...chaotic.  It flew about her head in a sudden storm of whipping fury, reshaping and styling itself into a big, messy, brown, bun behind her head.  Despite it&#39;s new compact form, her hair was no shorter, and Rachel was suddenly well-aware of its weight.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit...&quot; she grunted, as the lines on her face deepened, her face taking a slightly more aged look.  &quot;I guess that&#39;s what having kids will do to you,&quot; she grumbled, frustrated.  <br />
<br />
Although her body was still that of a 28 year old, she appeared to be in her early thirties.  Her eyes had slight bags, her cheeks were less smooth, her hair showing a few single strands of grey buried under waves of chestnut.  Her breasts were enormous, each sagging underneath their new weight.  Her bottom had gone from a cute bubble to a full booty, each step sending a jiggling wave through its impressive mass.  Her tummy was a doughy mess, her thighs thick with a slight trace of cellulite.  Even her hands, which had been dainty only moments before, now seemed significantly plumper.<br />
<br />
She could even feel the changes within as a new place in her heart opened up for her nonexistent children.  She felt waves of unabashed love pour from her, making her want to cry.  Rachel, the 19 year old who&#39;d received a package that morning, had never once considered the possibility of kids.  Now Rachelle, the 28 year old soccer mom, was shaking at the thought of not having any at all.  &quot;At the very least,&quot; she decided, &quot;I&#39;m getting a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
The maternal figure&#39;s thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a loud rapping at the locked door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel? Get out!  You&#39;ve been in there all morning!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachelle, (Rachel was a girl&#39;s name, and she was no longer a girl), made for the window.  She was filled with enough new emotions as it was.  She wasn&#39;t about to explain herself to her mother.</p>
