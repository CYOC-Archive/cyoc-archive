<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lilith narrowed her eyes as she gazed at the formerly abandoned amusement park. Circe appeared to have been quite busy in setting up her own kingdom from which to rule. After discovering her assassination attempt had been only partially successful, she decided to make her presence known, if for no other reason than to deny the demons actions.<br />
<br />
Lilith knew that no matter what torture the demon went through, it would not talk. Lilith had made sure that if the creature was about to confess to being sent by her it would instantly be pulled back into the netherworld. Still though something had been accomplished. Circe and Baba were growing desperate, so desperate that they were willing to use Kellies friends to help in negotiating a peace agreement with the Kitsune. Lilith knew this and realized she could use this to her advantage. She knew Jack would see their actions as traitorous and it would give her ample reason to destroy not only Circe and Baba but Kellie as well. All she needed to do was capture them in the act.<br />
<br />
As Lilith now entered the park she glared angrily at the nude anthro animals busily repairing the various rides and attractions throughout the park. “Abominations,” she hissed as she picked up her pace. <br />
<br />
“Excuse me,” a voice called in disgust. Lilith turned to see an anthro blue cheetah approach her, a stern look upon his face. “I’ll have you know miss,” Franklin said sternly. “That racist and bigoted language such as that will not be tolerated on these grounds. Continue acting like that I’ll not only have you removed by security but sue you for defamation of character.”<br />
<br />
“You must be joking,” Lilith scoffed.<br />
<br />
“I don’t joke when it comes to hateful and bigoted comments,” Franklin said, narrowing his eyes as he glared at Lilith.<br />
<br />
“You don’t know who I am do you creature,” Lilith said, a small smirk spreading across her lips.<br />
<br />
“Don’t know don’t care,” Franklin scoffed. “All I know is that you sound like a bigot. I’ll have you know I’ll be filing a restraining order on you. My goddess will give me your information. After that I’ll sue you for everything your worth. Now security, escort this woman out.”<br />
<br />
Lilith giggled girlishly as Franklin now beckoned two large anthro lion men towards her. Lilith has not intended to physically become involved however a direct threat allowed her to act. It was why she had her demon only attack Vixi and not the traitorous Baba or Circe. The followers of magical beings could kill eachother without consequence, however if those followers harmed one of them then they could act in self defense. These three would suffer the consequences and because they had threatened her, their was nothing Circe could do in retaliation. “This shall be most entertaining.”<br />
<br />
The two anthro lions approached Lilith, grabbing her firmly by the arms as they were looking to forcibly remove her. As they took a step they were stopped dead in their tracks. Liliths feet seems rooted to the spot. Looking at her in confusion they noticed her give them a small smile.<br />
<br />
“My turn.”<br />
<br />
Lilith simply twirled her index finger in retaliation. The anthro lions necks snapped, their heads twisting a compete 180 degrees. Franklin gaped at his fallen comrades as their lifeless bodies collapsed in a heap on the floor. As he turned to flee he found himself rooted in place as Lilith now approached.<br />
<br />
“What was that you were saying earlier,” she grinned. “Did you threaten me. Threaten to do me harm and in turn harm my family?”<br />
<br />
Franklin was terrified, barely able to stammer as Lilith leered at him, like a predator toying with its prey. “W.who are you,” he stuttered.<br />
<br />
“No one of consequence,” she sighed. “An acquaintance of your goddess. Apparently her followers aren’t familiar with me. Pity, I did not come here for violence, merely to talk. Your actions doomed those two though. Any who place their hands upon me need to understand that it is a death sentence.”<br />
<br />
“Am I going to die,” Franklin whimpered.<br />
<br />
“Possibly,” Lilith answered. “I haven’t quite made up my mind.”<br />
<br />
“If it helps  I won’t file that lawsuit,” Franklin offered. Lilith could only chuckle at the anthro cheetahs response. “How truely human you are,” she sighed. “Mankind is always consumed with the acquisition of objects, they have no concept of what is truely valuable. I will say this though, act against me in anyway and your suffering shall be eternal. Now, fetch your goddess, we need to talk.”<br />
<br />
Franklin now found himself free of to move once more as Lilith took a step back. Fearfully gazing at the woman he turned quickly running for Circes office. Lilith didn’t need to wait long as Circe appeared before her in a cloud of smoke, an angry look upon her face.<br />
<br />
“Interesting kingdom,” Lilith said quietly. “Not sure why you decided to to build it.”<br />
<br />
Circe was enraged as she looked between Lilith and the two bodies she had left. “You have some nerve showing up after sending an assasin to kill my follower,” she spat.<br />
<br />
“I did no such thing,” Lilith said calmly. <br />
<br />
“I have your demon in custody,” Circe proclaimed. “He’ll talk and then I will have the proof.”<br />
<br />
“And you would believe a demon,” Lilith scoffed. “Tell me Circe. Was my magic sensed upon this demon.”<br />
<br />
“No,” Circe said bitterly. “No the Magic seemed to originate from the other timeline but I know it was you Lilith.”<br />
<br />
“You give me far too much credit child,” Lilith said sweetly. “Masking ones magic is quite a feat. No, I believe you just wish to blame me for your failures. You ignore the obvious because of your distaste for me.”<br />
<br />
“And why shouldn’t I have distaste for you,” Circe yelled. “You’ve murdered two more of my followers.”<br />
<br />
“They placed their hands upon me,” Lilith stated, “By the old rules if the minions of Another threaten or physically harm one of us they forfeit their lives. Your guards placed their hands upon me unprovoked. This was their punishment.”<br />
<br />
Circe grit her teeth, Lilith had found a loophole. Franklin and her guards were not aware of who Lilith was. When Franklin had threatened her and her guards placed their hands upon her they had given her cause to strike. She could easily claim her actions were in self defense. It also meant that Circes kingdom could face retaliation from Lilith and her demons.<br />
<br />
“Circe tell me,” Lilith asked. “How does this, kingdom, accomplish our goal of balancing the light and dark. How does this benefit Jack in anyway?”<br />
<br />
“It is for his....amusement,” Circe said quickly. “I built this so Jack could have somewhere to go for entertainment.”<br />
<br />
Lilith could only nod, narrowing her eyes as she scanned the park. “I doubt he would like this very much,” she stated. “This....kingdom, only seems to benefit you, not the one we have sworn to protect.” Lilith turned her back to Circe as she now began to leave the park of her own free will. “A word of advise Circe,” she said.<br />
<br />
Circe narrowed her eyes as Lilith turned her head, an evil smile spreading across her lips. “Be careful of the company you keep,” Lilith smirked. “I would hate to have to destroy you if your actions threatened Jack. Besides, this place seems unsafe. If I can not enter without being attacked, who can. Perhaps you should....reconsider your actions.”<br />
<br />
As Lilith vanished, Circe sighed in frustration. Lilith saw Circe as a threat to Jack and her own power. Worse, her followers had accidentally given her the ability to reduce this kingdom to ash whenever she wanted. She now needed Kellies help more than ever to bring peace with the Kitsune. The fate of her kingdom, her followers, and herself depended on it.</p>
