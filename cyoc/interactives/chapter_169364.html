<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I procrastinated a lot, but enjoy.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“We go to your room, <i>bellissima</i>,” Vinnie asserted his demand with a confident grin, continuing when the girl had a confused face, “When we are done, you would be in bed, and we are going to do this, all, night, long.” Grinning as he kissed her, Vinnie felt her becoming weak in her legs as he quickly took her into a bridal carry. <br />
<br />
She giggled, happy with her choice for the night. “Name’s Krista, and my room is 502.” <br />
<br />
He nodded, feeling her dainty arms hold on to him tighter, no doubt wanting him as much as he wanted her. His groin burned at the hours ahead. “Licuit, mi domina, we’re going to have the night of our lives.” <br />
<br />
Inside, Keith couldn’t be more excited at the prospect. This is the first time that he would have a one night stand. All of his teenage years, he relieved his teenage needs through pornography, and even though it was staged and the memories of Vinnie’s escapades filled his mind, Keith couldn’t wait to try.<br />
<br />
As the lift stopped and the doors opened, Vinnie walked out with his mouth kissing her neck, moans, and grunts interlacing.<br />
<br />
____________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Sitting on the bed, you were unable to sleep with the buzz of the beer keeping you awake. You couldn’t stop thinking about Keith, his predicament, the fact that he pushed another guy off a girl and won her for a ride. As far as you know, Keith didn’t get a lot of action, with his tall but unattractive visage and his general personality. He wasn’t bad, but not a lot of hot girls wanted to bed him. <br />
<br />
The improvement that he had attained just with the keys alone causes you to grow envious. And the agonizing wait for Keith to return was just too long, considering that he was the one that was currently holding the keys. You get off the bed with frustration in your heart. Desire unmet, you instead walk to the mirror and began imagining what you wanted to be instead of wasting energy being frustrated.<br />
<br />
“Maybe…” You begin to think of what you wanted to become. Thinking back on that frat bro, you think of the stereotype that was largely generalized of them. Not caring about education, just wanted to party and have sex every day. You recall your desire to be as muscular as they did, perhaps trade away your current life for theirs. But you know it would be temporary heaven. “Always had the fantasy of becoming jocked.”<br />
<br />
“Something with benefits?” You ask yourself, thinking. With your law degree almost finished, you can’t just throw away the years working on it for that kind of life. Maybe you could become a successful lawyer instead? If what Keith was experiencing would not be forgotten, perhaps you could cheat your way through that degree? You think of the pros and cons, and honestly, because the keys did not alter reality, you could get that degree done with and live with Keith, transforming your lives repeatedly. “If it worked like that, it would be a fallback plan if anything goes awry.”<br />
<br />
Or you can be someone that isn’t related to any of your current lives. Was there a way to influence what you could become? Perhaps Keith and Vinnie’s control could be of use. You take the bare white hotel brochure and a pencil, beginning to write what you wanted to be. There were many, with each option coming with their bullet list of traits you wanted to have. <br />
<br />
After a handful of options, you stop, becoming mentally exhausted with all the things you had to think about and consider. Looking at the clock revealed that it was 3 am, an hour and a half since you began writing. Keith still isn’t back yet, and you decided that it was time to go to sleep. <br />
<br />
Sliding into the bed with a groan, you close your eyes, wishing to just fall asleep already.<br />
<br />
_____________________-<br />
<br />
“<i>Cazzo</i>, that was a good night.” Vinnie murmured as he unlocked the door and entered. Locking the door, seeing you blackout drunk on the bed and heavily asleep, he didn’t want to disturb you and instead got ready for a good cleansing bath. Putting the car keys, his gun, and his wallet as quietly as he could, Keith went into the bathroom to take a bath. <br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to him, the moment the water began flowing it disturbed you enough that you woke up. You were always a light sleeper, and the first thing seeing the keys, gun, and wallet on the nightstand made you aware the Keith was back. Checking the clock revealed that it is now half-past 5, and getting the almost 3-hour nap was enough to get your energy despite being extremely groggy. Excitement bubbles in your heart to get Keith&#39;s help to transform you, desires tamping down all the fears that you had. This is a Vinnie-enhanced Keith, and as far as you know, he doesn’t make mistakes.<br />
<br />
Taking the list, you sit on the bed. It would be a while before his bath was over, considering what he just did. While waiting, you target the pencil on the table absentmindedly pressing the buttons. It jittered in place as the colors shift, leaving a piece of straw instead. Frowning at the complete randomness, you wait.<br />
<br />
A knock on the door jolted you out of your daydream, accompanied by a slightly slurred, and rough voiced “Room Service!”<br />
<br />
Suspicion quickly bloomed in your heart. What kind of room service comes this early in the morning? <br />
<br />
You store Vinnie’s gun into the nightstand before you decide to act.<br />
<br />
The knocks became louder and more incessant and worry bloomed instead. Rather than waiting for the short-tempered worker to write you off as a bad customer, you walk to the door. “Coming!”<br />
<br />
As you unlock the door, rubbing your eyes in an attempt to at least look presentable and see who is at the door, a loud crashing sound erupts from the door as the chain snaps off with the door slamming open. You could only retreat in a stunned stupor as you got a good sight of the fireman wannabe.<br />
<br />
It was the frat bro, face red with anger. <br />
<br />
Coincidentally, Keith rushes out of the bathroom completely naked, perhaps worried more about you than his nakedness. It was endearing, perhaps, as you turn to Keith with a shocked face. Talk about bad timing!<br />
<br />
“You FUCKER!” The rough, slurred voice boomed in your ears as a muscular arm coiled itself around you, and you finally notice the blade pressing to your jugular. Your heart beats faster as your mind panics. The frat bro stares at Vinnie with smoldering <i>hate</i>. “You took my girl and you’re going to pay.” <br />
<br />
Venom dripped from his voice, and it was too much for you to handle with the knife near your throat! Even as you struggle, the muscular arm of the frat bro held you fast, instead you stilled as the negative act of <i>flight or fight</i> took hold.<br />
“<i>Ragazinno</i>, you shouldn’t be challenging me-” Vinnie started but was cut off as the frat bro interrupted with the blade inching closer. <br />
<br />
“Shut up! This nerd here is going to get it because you!” He choked you tighter, even when you’re already gasping for air.<br />
<br />
Vinnie wanted to move, but Keith was too concerned for you. He glanced towards where his gun should have been but saw only his wallet. He turns to you, seeing the keys in your grasp.<br />
<br />
His face was serious, cold. But the care he has for you was enough to bring you out of the paralysis. Feeling returned to your clammy hands as you felt the keys, and it could save you. Closing your eyes tightly, you click the keys towards your assailant, with only one thought. <br />
<br />
“<i>SAVE ME!</i>”<br />
<br />
A flash of light and heat erupted behind you as you gasp at the sensation but despite the ongoing transformation, you were stuck.<br />
<br />
Looking at the arms that hold you revealed them to be made of blurring light, and yet it was jarringly solid as you try to escape the stilled frat bro. You can’t.<br />
<br />
Struggle as you may, the silhouette of the man doesn’t let go.<br />
<br />
“Take a deep breath, Alan.” And you saw your friend, Keith, calming you down. You’re still panicking, this was the third time in <i>one</i> day that you’ve been threatened! Ragged breaths were all you could do.<br />
<br />
You click the keys towards the bind you’re in, but it held no change at all. Deciding Keith would be better, you throw the keys to him.<br />
<br />
“K… Keith, try to change it to something.” You struggled, but it did not budge. Keith aimed at the taller and bigger target, clicking again.<br />
<br />
And again, nothing happens.<br />
<br />
“What is wrong with the keys?” Keith clicked again to release you, but no indication of anything happened.<br />
<br />
“P-Perhaps it could only do one at a time.” You shakily tell Keith. But realization occurred if that was the case.<br />
<br />
<i>It was not done yet.</i><br />
<br />
Cool air rushes to your privates as you join Vinnie in an impromptu nude fest, and you realize it with blood rushing to both your face and dick. <br />
<br />
“One, ew, two, nice dick.” Keith chuckled earnestly but with concern. You knew Keith was straight, and by assumption, Vinnie seemed to be bi.<br />
<br />
“Keith… I don’t think the transformation is done, and it seems to involve me too!” You suddenly felt what seems to be a hot, solid dong hotdogging you. “Close the door!”<br />
<br />
He rushed without complaint as he closed the front door, careful not to touch the bright silhouette. Returning to the bed just in case to help you, Keith could only watch.<br />
<br />
“I- ah!” You scream in shock as the dick made of light inches into your ass, and you notice your lower body is no longer to your control. “I really believe the keys can only -oh my go- focus on one change and I need to see this throug-” You scream as the frat bro’s light dick slips inside in one fell swoop, thankfully there was no pain as it settled pleasurably full.<br />
<br />
And your lower half began to move in tandem with the silhouettes thrusts. Keith visibly wanted to look away, but he watched, even as his bulge rises. <br />
<br />
You groan and moan as the heat rapidly spreads from your rectum to your whole body, pulses pumping into you. With each thrust, heat cascades to your whole body. But the feeling that your body was growing was what broke you out of the pleasurable trance. You could not watch what was happening to your body as the light arm forced you to only face forward, but you could see your forearm.<br />
<br />
And it was rapidly growing. With each pulse, your arms gain girth and size. Even your hands shift with each pleasurable thrust into your asshole. The feeling of your body growing taller and bulkier was euphoric beyond measure as you lose yourself in the sensation. Your bones creak as they become stronger, noticing the solid energy behind you shrink. Even so, your lower body is stuck to the floor now, letting the shrinking mass to continue pounding you with the consistent girth.<br />
<br />
As the mass shrunk, with one final, heavy thrust that you could feel the force with, the mass slips into your asshole with rapid pace as the head of the silhouette enters last, rushing straight to your head. You could feel it, the mass of a personality and mind rapidly shooting and tackling like an offensive lineman straight into your roiling psyche. It rushed into the mass, mixing and melding as you white-out and roar in absolute pleasure as you, Alan Page, mesh completely with Liam Barnes.<br />
<br />
The last bit of your original semen spurts out, blurring in mid-air and comes back to coat your dick, becoming a condom. As your mind meshes and merges, two sets of memories were put into the back of the mind as a completely new set, a fabrication of a life a person such as you would have lived took the forefront control. What was the bedrock personality of both you and Liam merges, and what remained of the leftover seemed to flow straight into your engorging balls, spurting and spewing non-stop as the condom caught it all, creating a ping-pong sized sphere. It was all metaphorical, but it was what you randomly recall in one of your gay erotica you’ve read.<br />
<br />
Your lower body returns to your control as you collapse, as a fusion of the sleep clothes you wore and Liam’s blurring onto your obviously muscular body, pajama jerseys, and jeans.<br />
<br />
You take in harsh, exhausted breaths. In your mind, you’re no longer Alan or Liam. You’ve become one, and not even separate…<br />
<br />
“Fuck, bro.” You mutter, chuckling. “That was hella intense. My loser self loved it.” You shake your head, correcting that notion as you stare at Vinnie with a slight flash of anger that immediately dissipated. “I mean, being a total nerd isn’t bad at all, but I’m a much more preferable option.”<br />
<br />
“Alan?” Vinnie’s voice greeted you as you accept the hand to stand up. You notice that you’re of equal height now. “Is it you, compagno.”<br />
<br />
“Sup bro, yeah, it’s me. Somewhat.” You rub the back of your head, thinking about how to reveal this. “Simply said, I’m not Alan or Liam, I’m both at the same time. They’re merged to make me, and fuck it if I previously said I don’t want this kind of life.”</p>
