<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He remembered seeing Mr. Evans' Old English Sheepdog the other day.  Michael then felt the most oddest sensation coming from his ears. He lifted up a hand and touched his ears, first the right and then the left. His eyes widen as he felt them beginning to curl down the sides of his head. And he could feel a light coating of fuzz thickening on them. It was real! <br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; He exclaimed loudly. &quot;How can this be happening..?&quot;<br />
Fur began sprouting across the sides of his face and neck in a warm, prickling itch that was quite...pleasant.  A slight sting caused him to blink his eyes rapidly as thick, white fur began to cover his face and thicken into something shaggy. A black smudge touched his nose and lips, and for a brief moment, he wondered where the smudge had come from. No, Michael thought quizically, his nose and lips were really turning black! Cracks and jolts rocked his face as both his nose and mouth pushed outward into a bearded and mustached dog's muzzle. His teeth sharpened and his tongue lengthened. He began to pant. He could then feel his human hair thickening into a thick, shaggy white and dark gray mop of fur. The fur cascading down over his still changing face.<br />
&quot;Ro, rop! Woof!&quot;  A lump formed in Michael's thick and now canine throat. His vocal chords were changing into those of a dog's . &quot;Grr...woof!&quot;<br />
Michael shook his shaggy head and tried to speak again. <br />
&quot;Woof&quot;..pant..pant.. &quot;Woof!&quot; Was the best he could manage<br />
Michael tried lifting one of his hands up to where he could see it past his muzzled face. But what he saw wasn't his hand, just a shaggy paw covered in thick, white fur. It was the same story with his other hand. His hands, paws. had changed. His fingers had grown stumpy and his thumbs along with the palms of his hands were now a part of his wrist. Short claws and leathery pads protruded on the tips of his stubby fingers. He whined and panted as he clumsily used his paws to undo the buttons on his shirt. But his paws were too clumsy to undo them, so he slashed down with his claws. Buttons flew off and bounced across the floor as he began to pull his shirt off. He was surprised to see thick, shaggy white and gray fur covering a chest that had lengthened and deepened into something distinctly bear-like.  He then felt a jabbing sensation coming from the base of his spine. Geez, he thought urgently, a tail!&quot; He dropped to the floor and stuggled to pull himself out of his jeans as his hips and legs contorted themselves into his new hindquarters. After a minute of struggling, he pull himself out of his pants and shook himself, fluffling up his new shaggy fur coat. Panting from an odd mix of pleasure and exertion, he looked at his stumpy tail and then wagged it. Weird, he could really feel it wagging back and forth! Embarrassment flushed his mind and scented the air around him as the shaggy layer of dark gray fur grew across his hips. Awkwardly he sat on his new haunches and looked as his manhood was swallowed up by a furry sheath. His loins swelled into something bear-like. His feet were the last to go as he pushed himself up onto all fours. Still panting from exertion, he looked himself over just as the changes stopped. <br />
What greeted his eyes was a large, bear-like body covered in a thick, shaggy coat of white and black fur. He was no longer a man. He was a large, Old English Sheepdog. His nose and then his ears twitched as a plethora of new smells and sounds invaded his new canine senses.  Everything became crisper and more distinct than ever before. He let out a surprised woof.<br />
Calm down, just calm down, Michael told himself. His panting began to slow down as he gave himself a second look over. I am still me inside. He then smiled and wagged his stumpy tail. I am just a large, friendly Old English Sheepdog at the moment. He then remembered the note. He had set it to last only a day or two. Michael sat on his haunches again and found his shaggy body beginning to relax. At least, I am still able to think like a human, he thought, and in a day or two I'll be back to my old human self.<br />
Now then, he thought, why don't I have some fun as a large, cuddly sheepdog? He thought to himself with a smile on his canine lips.</p>
