<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mom decided that we girls will be going over to the mall to spend some quality time with each other to deepen our sisterly bonds and our mother-daughter relationship as well. While we all girls were discussing matters related to shopping and relaxing spa, Amelia or now my big brother David and Dad were discussing matters related to manliness that I had been taught up since childhood like not expressing your emotions through your face, not crying, being strong-willed in front of others and other things like how to handle our third leg, etc. which was a headache for Amelia. While we girls were chatting we heard noises coming from the stairs where we saw Dad and Amelia coming downstairs together. I could clearly see that Amelia was now looking at us with a poker face without expressing any emotions but as it was my body not long ago I could identify that she was clearly nervous and embarrassed as she felt strange walking in another person&#39;s body. When Amelia came over to the dining table she saw that I was sitting at her seat, she lashed out at me without even giving a glance to the gazes everyone was giving to her. &quot;David! how dare you sit on my seat? This is no place for neet&#39;s like you to sit.&quot; When she said this she was immediately reprimanded by Dad as he said to Amelia in a very stern voice &quot;David! This is no manner to talk to your little sister since this is your first offence as David you will be exempted from the punishment but if it happens again you will be grounded without any electronic devices. Now go back to your seat as this seat is for your little sister Amelia not yours David.&quot;<br />
When I heard there discussing I was really embarrassed because I was now through and through Amelia in my families eyes. Amelia then went to my old seat where she was also informed that she will be exempted to go to school for 15 days if she behaves well to assimilated with her new body. She was really happy as this was the only good news she heard since the operation.<br />
When Amelia saw that I was looking at her she asked me &quot;Hey what are you looking at loser! Go eat your dinner little princess!&quot; She ridiculed me but as though remembering that our parents were also there so she called me a little princess which was still quite embarrassing for me but my parents didn&#39;t intervene in our brother and sister&#39;s conversation. Well seeing me and Amelia in a conflict was quite normal so everyone felt quite normal seeing this lively scene but we both weren&#39;t that interested as today was a very hectic day so after eating our dinner I went back to Amelia&#39;s room where I laid down on the bed. After laying over there for some time I heard Melody come over. &quot;Big broth... Sister Amelia can I sleep with you today? Melody wants to sleep with my new big brother cum sister.&quot; I was just about to refuse her but when I saw her pleading eyes that were not stained with anything and gave a pure feeling, so I gulped down the words I was about to say to her as I nodded to her request.<br />
Melody was quite delighted as she was about to jump over toward the bed but when she looked over at what I was wearing she commented to me &quot;Big sister Amelia though I must say this dress is really pretty but Mommy says that we should change to our nightsuit when we go to sleep otherwise we might get some baddie skin disease which will make skin look like &#39;hulk&#39;. So big sister should really change into something more comfortable like Mellody.&quot; When I heard her I looked down at my clothes which had now become wrinkled due to me rolling around on the bed to remove my frustration which made the hem of my dress attached to the back of my neck part of the one-piece which exposed my panties. I was really embarrassed as I tried to straighten the hem of my dress with a very red face like a cute little girl and as an instinct memory I ducked down before straitening my dress which looked very prim and proper for a young lady of my current age. When Melody saw me being flustered she couldn&#39;t help but giggle as she said to me &quot;Big sister now you truly look like big sister Amelia whenever she gets embarrassed. hehe..ehehe....&quot; When I heard her say this I couldn&#39;t help but pinch her round cheeks as to show her affection.<br />
I truly realized that I would need to get a change of clothes to wear while sleeping otherwise I might just become a show model who loves to show her skin and privates to others. So I dashed over to the cupboard to look for an appropriate night dress for me to wear but it was really difficult for a former man to choose so I asked for Melody&#39;s help which turned out very useful as she was the only person who most interacted with Amelia so she took a very cute looking night dress for me to wear which had a matching colour with the night suit Melody was currently. So after wearing the suit we truly looked like sisters. After dressing myself up we both slept over on Amelia&#39;s bed together while hugging each other.<br />
While we were sleeping together I suddenly felt a strange stomach ache with made me feel really strange but as I was sleeping I didn&#39;t put too much thought into it due to which my panties were now stained with ............</p>
