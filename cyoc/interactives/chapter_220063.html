<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few times I woke up were...exhausting, to say the least.<br />
<br />
The first time it happened, I woke up, slumped against the wall, breasts the size of watermelons weighing me down. The sight of them had sent a shock of surprise through me, and, as the adrenaline surged, so too did my breast size. They&#39;d started to grow again, inflating right before my eyes. The gray shirt they&#39;d given me quickly went taut, and it didn&#39;t take long until it was ripped apart, letting my tits fall out. Naturally, seeing my tits bloat up like water balloons sent my anxiety spiking, which made my chest leap up in size, dragging my body atop them with a scream as they began to fill up the small dimensions of the cell. The hissing noise reappeared, and my head began to get dizzy...and once again, I was unconscious.<br />
<br />
The next time, I woke up slower, feeling dazed. I quickly looked down...but...however much time had passed, it had been enough for my breasts to shrink back down. And they had, thankfully, shrunk back down. Apparently that was a thing...they were still prone to growing...but they would also go back down.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take me long to realize what was going on. Anytime I got excited...in any way...fear...anger...being horny...it would make them grow. Being asleep, or being knocked unconscious...and they would shrink.<br />
<br />
It probably wouldn&#39;t surprise anyone to learn that realizing this sent me into an angry spiral of depression and anxiety. I began to scream, thrashing around in anger. After everything I&#39;d been through, after all the destruction my tits had caused...now I was faced with having THIS happen to me. It took me a while to calm down. I woke up - and was subsequently knocked out - three more times over the course of the next few days, each time waking up and just...letting it out. Fuck whoever these people were. Fuck my life! I was done.<br />
<br />
Eventually, they&#39;d started to talk to me again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stand with your back against the wall, please,&quot; a male voice said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you!&quot; I shouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stand against the wall, please,&quot; the voice repeated. <br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK YOU!!!&quot; I shouted, falling back with a cry as my breasts exploded outwards yet again. &quot;Damn it! What...did you just want to watch them grow?!&quot; I shouted. The gas began to fill the room once more, but I didn&#39;t care. It was worth it. &quot;Fuck you...you wanna just...look at my tits...bastards...&quot; Before I fell unconscious, I managed to lift my hand to flip off the one-way mirror on the other side of the room.<br />
<br />
Finally, at some point yesterday, I&#39;d woken up again on the cot with normal sized breasts. No one spoke to me. I just...sat there. I cried a bit, but thankfully I wasn&#39;t worked up enough to fuel any growth. I was just...tired. I didn&#39;t know where I was. I didn&#39;t know what had become of anyone I knew. I didn&#39;t know who these people were, except they were probably associated with the government. I didn&#39;t even know how long it had been? Days? Maybe even weeks? Maybe even months...since I&#39;d been locked away in here with no contact with the outside world. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stand with your back against the wall, please,&quot; came the voice over the intercom.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t yell, but I didn&#39;t get up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well then,&quot; the voice said impatiently.<br />
<br />
The intercom went silent.<br />
<br />
And I was left alone.<br />
<br />
I sat there for the rest of the day. No one said anything further. But eventually, I started to get hungry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I get something to eat?&quot; I asked, looking up at the camera in the corner of the room. No response. &quot;Uh...hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
No response.<br />
<br />
Which brings us to now. My stomach is growling, and I&#39;m just...sitting here. Annoyed. They hadn&#39;t given me anything in this room. The bed was bare now - my sheets had been taken away. The only clothes I had on were a pair of gray panties - all the other tops they&#39;d given me had been ripped apart, and I guess they were getting tired of replacing them.. But seriously, what kind of assholes didn&#39;t even give you a pillow? <br />
<br />
The intercom crackled to life. &quot;Stand with your back against the wall, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you,&quot; I muttered, but I stood up, and put my back to the wall. My chest was flat - as flat as it had been before this nightmare had happened... The wall was cold, and sent a wave of goosebumps up my arms. I stood there, naked save for the panties, staring defiantly at the one way mirror. Let em stare, motherfuckers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Stay there for a moment...alright.&quot; The intercom crackled off. I stood there, hating the fact that I&#39;d given in.<br />
<br />
But in the next moment, a small opening appeared in the door to my cell, and a bowl of soup appeared on a tray with some crackers and water. I let out a gasp and stumbled forward. I&#39;m not embarrassed to admit that I downed it as quickly as I could, even licking the bowl after. The crackers soon followed.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t exactly the more exciting meal in the world, but...when you&#39;re really hungry, whatever food you get will taste amazing.<br />
<br />
The downside was, now that my hunger had been sated...my mind was free to focus on other things. Like wondering how long I would be here. <br />
<br />
And...wondering about my Uncle. I took a deep breath at this thought - I&#39;d been avoiding it until now, not wanting to consider the fact that someone in my own family had done this to me....and sighing with annoyance as I felt my breasts twitch slightly with a bit of growth...the fact...the fact that he was likely the one responsible for all of this...my own UNCLE...!<br />
<br />
I took a few more deep breaths, trying to calm myself, sitting down on my cot and looking down at my chest. They were smaller than they had been in a long time, but were slowly growing. I gave them a squeeze - hope those fuckers enjoy the show - and shook my head at the sensations. If it hadn&#39;t been for the fact that I was locked up like this...it might have been fun to experiment with them. <br />
<br />
I went to sleep, exhausted and scared, facing away from the mirror. <br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
The next day was shitty right from the start.<br />
<br />
I was awoken by a loud alarm, sending me into a gasping panic. Almost instantly my tits began to swell up, sending me careening over the side of the cot as they plumped up beneath me. &quot;Fuck!&quot; I shouted. &quot;FUCK YOU!&quot; I shouted again towards the mirror. The gas came a moment later, knocking me out yet again before the growth could continue on too much.<br />
<br />
When I came to the next time, I had been strapped to the cot. Two soldiers, covered in hazard gear, were drawing blood from my arm. &quot;Hey!&quot; I shouted, feeling a sudden burst of weight on my chest as my breasts grew. &quot;Get the fuck out of here! Get - agh!&quot; My breasts grew large enough to drape across my entire body, weighing me down considerably, blocking my view of the lights above and making it hard to breathe. This time, the knockout gas was a welcome respite.<br />
<br />
The next time I was woken up, I was instructed to stand against the wall again. This time it was for much longer. I don&#39;t know what they were doing - scanning me with something I guess. Monitoring my vitals? Who the fuck knew. No one answered any of my questions.<br />
<br />
They left me in peace for a bit, and so I returned to my cot, glumly looking around the bare walls.<br />
<br />
It started as an odd sensation, like...like I was being tickled. I let out a laugh, and then gasped slightly, feeling a wet sensation in my panties. Shit. I was getting turned on...big time. I felt a shiver go up my spine, and I leaned back, letting out a gasp. It was getting more intense now. I let out a long moan, shivering slightly, and my thoughts were consumed suddenly with...let&#39;s just say, colorful ones. Suddenly, all I could think about was how much I wanted Ashley to be in here. If she was, god, I&#39;d pin her up against the wall and let her know how I felt...let her know how much I&#39;d thought about her, desired her, even though I&#39;d been afraid to act on it because of how big my breasts had been. Right now, it didn&#39;t matter. The thought of her body pressed up against the wall, kissing her deeply...<br />
<br />
And then, of course, I felt the increased weight of my chest, and I let out a long, frustrated moan. Of course. <br />
<br />
Another test.<br />
<br />
I squealed at the sensation of my breasts dragging me forward, my nipples grounding against the smooth concrete ground...it only added to the sensations, making me grow more. &quot;You...sick fucks...&quot; I gasped, lying prone on my tits. The knockout gas soon followed.<br />
<br />
They switched things up the next day, but it wasn&#39;t any better. Instead of being jostled awake by a loud alarm, this time, they started off with whatever it was that made me feel horny. I woke up with a long moan, which quickly led to a longer one as my breasts surged with growth...this time, they didn&#39;t use the gas right away. My breasts billowed up more and more, filling the small cell alarmingly quickly and sending my body rising up towards the ceiling...when I&#39;d filled about three quarters of the room, the gas finally turned on.<br />
<br />
This time, when I came to, it was to find that I was still lying prone across my breasts, and that they were still larger than my body...but they were getting smaller. So I simply just...lay there. It took a few hours for them to shrink down completely. But they at least left me alone for the rest of the day. <br />
<br />
And the next morning, they were back at it again, this time spraying me with cold water in the morning, sending me gasping out of bed with another surge of growth. <br />
<br />
Enough was enough!<br />
<br />
When my breasts returned to a less cumbersome size and I could move normally again, I pounded on the mirror. &quot;What the fuck are you doing to me??&quot; I shouted. &quot;What&#39;s the point of any of this?! Tell me what&#39;s going on! I want a lawyer! I want my mom! Someone tell me what the fuck is going on!&quot;<br />
<br />
I was getting sick of these tests, of the lack of communication. I was getting sick of my breasts growing over and over again.<br />
<br />
I raised my fist to pound on the mirror again, but then the intercom crackled to life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Step back, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Growling, I followed the command.<br />
<br />
But then, moments later there was a hissing noise, and the door to my cell opened.</p>
