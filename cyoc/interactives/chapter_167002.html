<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel casually walked down the deserted suburban street with the magical box of chocolates under one arm. She enjoyed the feeling of the cool night breeze on her bare skin. A few days ago Rachel would never have done this, but now she never wanted to go back. She felt liberated. She felt like a veil was being lifted from her eyes that had always been there. Every sensation felt more vivid, and more enjoyable. Normally her bare feet would be hurting on the hard asphalt, but now it was like walking on a soft carpet. <br />
<br />
Her enjoyment was interrupted suddenly by a tugging in her mind toward one specific house. Curious, Rachel effortlessly lept over the picket fence and climbed the house to the window she was being drawn to. Inside, Rachel saw a pair sitting on a couch and playing some sort of video game. Both seemed about 18 or 19 and fairly average. <br />
<br />
The girl wore a tank top and sweats, and from what Rachel could see, had forgone a bra because of her non-existent bust. Her brown hair was buzzed along one side and left the other longer, like a punk rocker. <br />
<br />
The boy was dressed in a t-shirt and pair of sweats as well. His glasses reflected the TV screen just out of Rachel&#39;s view and his shaggy black hair hung close to his eyes.  His body wasn&#39;t much to behold, skinny and pale, much like the girl. <br />
<br />
Rachel noticed the overnight bag in one corner. &quot;Guess they&#39;re a couple of friends,&quot; she thought. &quot;But I feel something between them.&quot; Her awakening senses made her aware of a desire between the pair, it felt like a pull towards each other. Rachel reached out instinctively and found herself reading their minds to a small degree. Not reading like a book, but desires and thoughts were made known to her. She could tell the pair wanted to take their friendship further, but neither one wanted to make the first move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think I can help them along...and maybe give them the fantasy they so desire,&quot; Rachel smiled as the visions of their desire flashed through her mind. Reaching out, Rachel felt the building power from earlier flow out of her fingers and towards the pair.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Will sighed as the match ended and he could relax some.<br />
&quot;That was a tough game,&quot; Fiona remarked. <br />
&quot;I guess we know why the meta changed since last patch.&quot;<br />
&quot;You came in clutch that last bit though,&quot; Fiona gave Will a smile that caused his heart to suddenly flutter.<br />
&quot;Uh...yeah, you were really great too.&quot;<br />
&quot;You okay there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, just gotta go. Be right back,&quot; Will lept off the couch and hastily exited the room.<br />
<br />
&#39;I wonder what that was about. I sure hope he&#39;s alright, I hate to see him suffer,&#39; Fiona worried. She caught herself when she realized she meant it more than just one friend caring for another. Fiona liked Will, he was funny and his sneezes were adorable. She liked having him over for all night gaming sessions like tonight. Several of their friends had teased them both about there being more going on than just games, but both of them had said they didn&#39;t want to mess up their current situation. However those ideas did occasionally come up again and again, but she was just too afraid to make a move. She felt her chest and found her heart racing. She felt bold for some reason.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom Will was having a similar situation and splashed some water on his face.<br />
 &#39;Why do I feel so hot? And why can&#39;t I get these ideas out of my head?&#39;<br />
Ever since Fiona had smiled at him, Will had been bombarded with images of the two of them intertwined. And not just them both, but better versions of themselves. Both of them were impressive and Will definitely had a more impressive tool than his meager length.<br />
&quot;You alright in there? Next round is starting in a bit,&quot; Will heard Fiona call.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m coming,&quot; Will called back and left the bathroom, not noticing his veins pulsating along his arm.<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m back,&quot; Will announced himself, trying to sound confident and refreshed.<br />
&quot;You ready?&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you,&quot; Will surprised himself, not actually meaning to say that.<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Fiona replied. &#39;Has Will always had arms like that,&#39; she noticed his arms looked less skinny and slightly more defined. <br />
Will sat down and picked up his controller. &#39;Fiona should consider a bra sometimes, I didn&#39;t realize her shirt could tent like that,&#39; Will tried not to stare at the pair of points that were Fiona&#39;s nipples tenting the fabric.<br />
<br />
The round began and the pair focused on their game while their bodies slowly changed. As the match progressed Fiona had to shift her position to ease the slowly growing tightness of her panties as her ass pushed outward. Her chest also inflated into a pair of A cups and lifting her tank top up. <br />
<br />
Will on the other hand was feeling his underwear hugging his junk tighter than before. Will grunted slightly as his penis surged suddenly from 3 inches to 5 inches. Additionally the two of them were feeling hot. Droplets of sweat were beginning to drip down their bodies and wetting their clothes.<br />
<br />
The round ended but before either of the pair could speak, the game notified them that next round was in 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I&#39;ve never seen it start a new game that fast,&quot; Fiona leaned forward, pushing her growing breasts into the material.</p>
