<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ever since Dustin had signed up to participate in a bicycle race, he has been riding his bike every day over a period of three weeks. On the day before the race Dustin decided to take it easy and go for an easy ride through the main park in town and through the downtown area of the city. Ty had decided he wanted to go bike riding as well, and he met up with Dustin downtown and the two biked home together.<br />
<br />
“So Dustin, are you ready for tomorrow’s race?” Ty asked Dustin, while riding his bike next to his.<br />
<br />
“Ready as I’ll ever be!” Dustin answered, “Are you coming to watch me?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I’ll definitely be there to cheer you on, Dustin, you know that!” Ty responded excitedly.<br />
<br />
But then Dustin looked at Ty with a very serious expression on his face. “Promise me you’re not going to do anything weird during the race okay? No magic, no powers!”<br />
<br />
“I won’t do anything weird as long as nobody else does anything weird during the race!” he answered his big brother.<br />
<br />
Both boys rode up the driveway of their house and stored their bikes in the garage. Dustin went into the kitchen to prepare something for dinner while Ty ran up to his room.<br />
<br />
Ty was about to get ready to take a shower when he noticed the photo of himself and Peter on his dresser. It reminded him of friendship his cousin had with Dustin, and he though that Peter probably would have liked to see Dustin’s race. <br />
<br />
“Hey Peter I wish you were here right now…” he said out loud, while looking at the photo.<br />
<br />
Then he covered his mouth with his hand when it hit him that he had made a wish out loud! <br />
<br />
Suddenly Peter appeared in his bedroom in front of him, dribbling a basketball. Peter was shocked when he looked in front of him and saw Ty standing in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Ty! What are you doing here?” Peter shouted surprised.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean? This is my room! You’re at my house, Peter!” he answered.<br />
<br />
“What!? Why? I was in the middle of a basketball game, Ty! Send me back!” Peter shouted angrily at his cousin, as he looked around and realized that he was indeed in Ty’s bedroom and no longer on a basketball court in Toronto.<br />
<br />
“Dustin is riding in a bike race tomorrow and I thought maybe you wanted to see it. But if you want to go back then I’ll send you back… I’m sorry! That was a careless wish!” Ty explained calmly.<br />
<br />
“Well I may as well, I’m here now! You got some clothes I could wear tomorrow?” Peter asked him.<br />
<br />
Peter spent the night at Dustin and Ty’s house and slept on the couch. He fell asleep while watching TV, but he didn’t seem to mind. Ty was excited his cousin could be there to cheer on Dustin at the race.<br />
<br />
Peter and Ty got to their seats in the stands, as the bike riders were ready to start. When the race got started, Dustin made a strong start and jumped in fourth place! Another racer named Lance was in first place and an Italian named Benito was second. Dustin was in fourth place during the first half of the race, while the bikers were soaring over the length of the course.<br />
<br />
Both Ty and Peter cheered on Dustin every time Dustin approached their section of the stands.<br />
<br />
“Go Dustin GO!” they shouted, as their brother passed them by.<br />
<br />
It was apparent that Dustin would stay in fourth place until he finally started catching up to the rider who was in third. He got tired and started to fall behind, giving Dustin the opportunity to move into third, right behind the Italian.<br />
<br />
Benito was not about to let Dustin catch up to him and noticed how Dustin continued to move closer and closer to him. He saw Dustin as a direct threat and decided to take drastic measures in order to eliminate Dustin, or at least cause him to fall behind too much. Since the three were too far ahead of the others, it became likely they would finish in the top three.<br />
<br />
Out of desperation, Benito grabbed his water bottle, which was half full with cold water, and hurled it straight at Dustin’s face. Since Dustin was right behind him, riding at high speed, he felt the impact of the bottle smashing against his helmet and it caused him to lose his balance, slip, and fall on the ground!<br />
<br />
Ty and Peter saw that and stood up! They were both in shock!<br />
<br />
“Did you see that?” Ty shouted angrily, “He tried to knock Dustin out of the race!”<br />
<br />
Peter was about to say something when they noticed that Dustin got up, jumped back on his bike, and rejoined the race. He fell back to sixth place, but quickly gained momentum and regained his spot in third. But Peter noticed something else: Dustin dropped his water bottle when he fell down and he forgot to pick it up!<br />
<br />
“Dustin lost his water bottle!” Peter shouted at Dustin.<br />
<br />
“I have another water bottle right here…” Ty said, holding up Dustin’s spare bottle.<br />
<br />
“Let me handle this!” Peter said, as he grabbed the bottle and walked to the lowest rows in the stands.<br />
<br />
When he reached the outside wall, separating him from the stands and the track, he made himself transparent as walked right through the wall like a ghost! Then he waited for Dustin to come around until he was right in front of the place where Peter was standing, and he wished to freeze all the riders on the track! While they were all frozen on their bikes, Peter quickly walked up to Dustin and gently placed the water bottle in the holder which was attached to the bike frame. He then ran back to the wall and walked back through it, and he then unfroze them all. Nobody noticed that they had been frozen and nobody saw Peter put the bottle on Dustin’s bike!<br />
<br />
Peter ran up the stairs and sat back down next to Ty. He was happy with what he had done, but Ty still wanted to help Dustin catch up or pass Benito.<br />
<br />
“Peter, I’m going to help Dustin out! Benito is cheating and it’s not fair!” Ty declared.<br />
<br />
He then concentrated on Dustin and added more muscle to his legs. Dustin was panting as he struggled to keep up the pace. He breathing got deeper, as he slowly got closer to Benito. It was the final lap and it looked like he would finish third. He was getting tired, and he felt he was slowing down. The pace was grueling and he came close to slipping back into fourth. Then his thighs got stronger and his calves got bigger. His arms and shoulders were strengthened, and a new burst of energy allowed him to push passed Benito into second on the final lap of the course! He closed in on Lance, but the racer was a professional and didn’t give up! It was a fight to the finish, but Dustin came in second, right behind Lance but a good distance in front of Benito!<br />
<br />
Both Peter and Ty cheered as Dustin crossed the Finish line and they were both very proud of him.<br />
<br />
They cheered a second time, as Dustin received his trophy during the awards ceremony, and they posed with Dustin as a photographer took the photo of the three of them together.<br />
<br />
When they got home, Dustin tapped Ty on the shoulder. <br />
<br />
“Hey, what did you do to my legs?” Dustin asked. He saw himself in the mirror and noticed how his muscles were bigger, for Ty forgot to shrink them back.<br />
<br />
“I did that because Benito was cheating! He threw his bottle at you and you almost lost the race! I couldn’t help it, Peter gave you your water bottle and I made your legs stronger. Well at least you made second place! Okay so shoot me, I broke my promise…” Ty responded angrily.<br />
<br />
“I’m not angry at you, Ty… I just wanted to know why you did it” Dustin said calmly.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, Dustin. I saw that you forgot your water bottle and I put it back in your holder on your bike.” Peter confessed, feeling a bit ashamed.<br />
<br />
“That’s alright, guys. Benito did an ugly thing, but that should not be your excuse to cheat too, right?” Dustin said sternly.<br />
<br />
Both Peter and Ty looked at each other, not really knowing what to say. They both apologized to Dustin, who in turn decided to order a pizza just to celebrate his second place trophy. Peter spent one more night at Dustin’s before Ty sent him back to Toronto. Dustin gave his trophy to Ty, along with the photo. Ty kept them on his dresser, next to the photo of Cousin Peter. <br />
<br />
The next day he got another invitation to participate in another sporting event. And Ty wondered what he would do this time?</p>
