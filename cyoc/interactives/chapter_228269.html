<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick Devon was sitting at his computer desk and spending his Saturday idly surfing the internet. The seventeen year old was about to shut off his laptop in favor of playing some video games when a pop up on his screen said he had been chosen to recieve the Chronoivac, a special  program that could change the user and their reality into whatever they wished. At first Derrick thought it could be some random hacker trying to infect his computer with a virus or try to steal his information and was tempted to just delete it. However a part of him wondered if maybe it wasn&#39;t and that what if the program was real and could really do what it said. Cautiously opening it Derrick prepared to close it or shut off his computer if things went bad. To his relief it revealed a bunch of profiles each with a list of menus of things that could be changed. Clicking on the one that had his name he found himself looking at a list displaying his height, weight, age, gender, race, hair color, eye color and so on with everything able to be altered with a click of the mouse and a few keystrokes.<br />
<br />
Humoring the program Derrick decided to test it and scrolled down to current clothing. Selecting underwear he changed briefs to diaper with a grin, thinking nothing would happen. That grin was soon replaced with shock for when Derrick hit enter he felt something weird happening inside his pants. The cottony fabric of his underwear seemed to be thickening up into some kind of plastic padded garment that spread his legs a little. Undoing the fly of his jeans he was shocked to find his white briefs had been replaced with an equally white teen disposable diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be real&quot; Derrick breathed out in awe, reaching down to poke the front of the diaper with a single. Feeling the padding crater with a crinkle like crunch at the spot he poked revealed that the garment was very much real. He really was wearing a diaper now. Overcome with many different emotions all at once with excitement ultimately winning out. Turning to look back at his laptop screen Derrick&#39;s lips slowly twisted into a smile as he began typing with anxious fingers.<br />
<br />
There was another reason the teenager had made the bizarre change to turn his underwear into a diaper other then merely testing the Chronoivac program. And that was because he was a diaper lover who fantasized about age regression and becoming young enough to go back to the garments. It was a lifelong dream of his that he now had the means to make a reality and he wasn&#39;t going to waste any time making it come true. As Derrick typed away he was also paying close attention to his new diaper, enjoying its soft cushiony feel around his bottom. He had always wanted to try out adult diapers but was too afraid to buy some and so all he knew of the experience was what other ABDL&#39;s wrote about online. Now that he was diapered for the first time since his youth Derrick knew his love for them was not misguided. However wearing them was only half the battle, now he had to make himself young enough so he could truly enjoy them as society would only be accepting of diapers from a baby. But more than that Derrick wanted to be a baby again and live that carefree innocent time of his life again for as long as he chose.<br />
<br />
After making a few last minute changes he hit enter then immediately got out of his seat and ran for his bed. Crawling on top of it on his hands and knees Derrick intently stared at his reflection and watched as the show began. For the next couple of minutes his body went through an amazing transformation as he regressed in age. As he became younger his body shrank and lost all maturity. Going backward through puberty felt really weird but it was worth it when Derrick saw himself become a ten year old. His clothes changed every few seconds to match his new age except for his diaper which shrinked in size to continue to fit him due to the destination age had had set. While it was interesting to see himself at eight and six Derrick got really excited when he pasted five and he started to look more like a baby. Now in the toddler age range he laid down on his back and tilted his head to the side, licking the few baby teeth that remained in his mouth. As the last few years left him Derrick watched as baby fat returned to his shorter limbs and his face became more cherub like. When the regression finished the former seventeen year old had become a three year old toddler. The young boy was dressed in nothing but a kiddie shirt and a diaper that had turned into a Pampers crusiers. That shift happened a few months after he left four and was around the same time his pants up and vanished, exposing his padding to the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at me, I&#39;m a baby again&quot; Derrick squealed with delight in his new baby voice. Flailing his arms and kicking his legs in joy the toddler embraced the majesty of the moment. Eventually settling down Derrick turned his attention away from him and to his room which had also changed. His teenage stuff was all still there but there was now two new furniture additions to his room in the form of a fully stocked changing table and a crib. And scattered over his carpeted floor were baby toys, some new and some old ones from his childhood. The reason for this mix and match room was because he made it so he was only physically regressed and just his family knew it. This way he would get to be cared for like a baby but still be adult in a way. Also he got to keep all his teenage stuff like his game consoles and laptop. There was some baby stuff he wanted to avoid having to eat baby food  which is why he became three. Though he did make it so he was still fed with a bottle. Lastly Derrick had made it so his mysterious regression was permanent, but since he still had his computer with the Chronoivac he could always change his mind and grow back up again anytime he wanted, giving him an unlimited time in diapers.<br />
<br />
Still sucking his thumb and feeling very relaxed at that moment Dereck continued to lie on his bed only to be surprised when...</p>
