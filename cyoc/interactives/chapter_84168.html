<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake entered the nurse&#39;s office holding his stomach and moaning in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh...&quot; Jake moaned, both hands clutching his stomach.  &quot;The pain!  I feel so sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Accompanying Jake was one of the hall monitors, an irritated looking man in his forties.  He approached the school&#39;s nurse, who had a look of deep concern on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good heavens,&quot; said the nurse.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong with the poor dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
The hall monitor rolled his eyes.  He&#39;d seen too many cases like this before, but it was his duty to take the little miscreants to the nurse anyway.  &quot;He&#39;s complaining of stomach cramps, or something.  He looked fine this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nurse knelt down next to Jake, thermometer already in hand.  &quot;I&#39;ll take him from here,&quot; she said to the man.  To Jake, she cooed &quot;It&#39;s alright, dear.  I&#39;ll take care of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hall monitor grunted and turned back toward the door.  &quot;Right.  Just send him back to class when you&#39;re done with him.  I suspect it&#39;s a case of New-Studentitus.  But what do I know?&quot;  And he left Jake and the nurse alone.<br />
<br />
The nurse was a kind, motherly woman.  Her office was adorned with colorful flowers and cartoon ornaments and posters, probably to keep whatever ailing student laying in the cot in the corner of the room cheery.  She took Jake&#39;s temperature, shined a light in his pupils, and even checked his abdomen for tenderness (to which Jake made sure to complain as loudly as possible).  After her inspection, the nurse just shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, honey,&quot; she said.  &quot;I just don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with you.  Would you like me to call your parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could I call them?&quot; Jake suggested.  &quot;I&#39;d rather do it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nurse smiled reassuringly.  &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t worry about a thing.  Go lay down.  I&#39;ll take care of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Jake said, a little too loudly.  &quot;I mean, uh, no, I should do it.  I have some... special medicine and it would be easier if I did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nurse frowned, but picked up a nearby phone and handed the receiver to Jake, pressing a button to get an outgoing line.  She stood there as Jake began dialing a number into the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, alone, please?&quot; Jake asked.  He threw in a cough for good measure.<br />
<br />
The nurse sighed.  &quot;Alright, dear.  When your done, let me know what they say.&quot;  She left the room, closing the door behind her.<br />
<br />
Alone, Jake finished dialing the number.  He paced anxiously, receiver in hand, as the other end rang.<br />
<br />
Finally, the other end picked up.  A matronly voice with a thick, Easter European accent answered.  &quot;Greetings, wandering soul!  It is I, Madame Mushka, Seer of the Stars, Parter of the Veils, and Bringer of Good Fortune.  How can I help to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nana, it&#39;s me, Jake.&quot;<br />
<br />
The thick accent immediately dropped and took on a surprised tone.  &quot;Jakey, dear?  What a surprise!  I wasn&#39;t expecting you to call today.  What time is it?  Shouldn&#39;t you be in school?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake gulped.  He wasn&#39;t sure how to proceed.  His grandmother had given her those pieces of paper only to use in dire emergencies.  His parents didn&#39;t know about it.  They didn&#39;t want Jake&#39;s grandmother teaching him any of her gypsy magic.  Something about upholding a stereotype.  Before he moved far away from his grandmother, she had taught him a few techniques in secret, so as to protect himself.  He hoped his grandmother, his Nana, could help him know.  Hopefully his parents wouldn&#39;t have to get involved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jakey?  Are you there?&quot; Jakes grandmother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Nana,&quot; he said.  &quot;Um, you know those hex slips you gave me?  Those pieces of paper?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; is grandmother asked quickly.  &quot;Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m fine!  It&#39;s just, uh, I may have done something wrong...&quot;  Jake attempted to relay the incident how it had happened, how Will had cornered him and how Jake had used  one of the slips to curse his assailant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jake,&quot; said his grandmother.  &quot;Casting a curse is easy.  Removing one can be extremely difficult.  I hope that bully is learning his lesson.  What did you curse him with, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just it,&quot; said Jake.  &quot;I don&#39;t really know, but I think it&#39;s making the problem worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse?  Jake, what were your exact thoughts when you threw the curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake shrugged, though he knew his grandmother couldn&#39;t see it on the other end of the line.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t really thinking at the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake!&quot; his grandmother reprimanded.  &quot;I thought I taught you better than that.  Such things can&#39;t just be thrown out thoughtlessly.  Curses need precise context.  Oh, I knew I shouldn&#39;t have given those slips to you.  I knew you weren&#39;t ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake felt ashamed.  He knew he probably deserved that, but he could feel sorry for himself later.  Forcing the lump back down his throat he continued the conversation.  &quot;Nana, I&#39;m sorry.  I really am.  But how do I reverse it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I just can&#39;t know unless I know what the curse actually is.  Do you remember your exact words when you cursed the boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t really remember.  Something about him being bigger and older.  And stronger.  And, when I saw him later, he looked bigger and older... and stronger.  I made things so much worse.  If he ever finds me again...&quot;  The thought terrified the boy.<br />
<br />
His grandmother was silent for a moment before she spoke again.  &quot;Alright Jake, I think I have an idea of what may be going on.  I think I can help you, but we&#39;re going to have a talk later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake sighed.  &quot;Yes, Nana.  And, thank you, Nana.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, dear, here&#39;s what you need to do...&quot;<br />
<br />
________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, Will was making his way home.  His father would be gone for the day and he wanted a better look at himself in a more private place.  Along the way, Will made sure to get as good a look at himself as he could from every window he passed by.  The curse didn&#39;t seem to take offense to this, so he went along, unhindered.  It didn&#39;t take long for him to get to his house.  It lay in the nicest part of town.  The house had to be the largest in the neighborhood, if not the whole town.  It was a white and grey modern thing, with smooth walls and sharp corners.  The windows were large, but prying eyes were kept away by a large fence and a gate accessed via key card.  There were no butlers or maids, but a gardener came around every other day and a cleaner twice a month to make the house look immaculate, both in and out.  There were perks to being senator.<br />
<br />
Will fished his wallet from his back pocket and pulled out his key card.  He couldn&#39;t help but chuckle when he saw his student ID tucked in the clear pocket reserved for drivers&#39; licenses.  His body and clothes may have changed, but the contents of his wallet sure hadn&#39;t.  The picture of his adolescent self was puny compared to him now.  Now he was an adult.  Now people couldn&#39;t tell him what to do.  He never stopped to think how this had happened or what caused the changes.  He just knew that they had happened and he was better for it.<br />
<br />
After slipping the card through the card reader and stepping inside, Will&#39;s first destination was his dad&#39;s bathroom.  He wanted a better view of himself that clear glass just couldn&#39;t provide.  The inside of the house was just like the outside, smooth, white, square, and sterile.  The house had little in the way of personality, other than the higher than average amount of patriotic iconography.  There were a few pictures of Will&#39;s father shaking hands with important political personalities, and a few trinkets suggesting Will&#39;s father had been in the military (he hadn&#39;t).  The refrigerator was bare of pictures and drawings, and the only people appearing in pictures in the hall were of political importance.  Will did appear in one picture, however.  It was a family portrait that hung above the fireplace in the den.  The family was done up in their Sunday best.  They all looked miserable, save for Will&#39;s father, who had a large, if cheesy, grin on his face.  Like the rest of the house, the portrait looked bland and sterile.<br />
<br />
Will opened the door to his father&#39;s bathroom and flicked on the light.  The baby blue wallpaper and flawless white tiled floor greeted him, as did a pair of floor to ceiling mirrors positioned next to a pair of large, granite sinks.  Of course, there was also a toilet and shower, but it was the mirrors Will was concerned most with.  He couldn&#39;t help but grin when he saw his reflection clearly.  His square jaw which was covered in stubble, pronounced brow, and his defined musculature were clearly evident now.  He reached down and stripped off his shirt.  He could see his defined pectorals, abs, and arms, all lightly covered with dark hair.  It was thicker on his stomach, chest, and forearms, but he could make out some hair on his upper arms as well.  He could also clearly see the flaming skull on his shoulder and the dagger on the underside of his forearm, as well as the letters on his knuckles.  He was a little disappointed he didn&#39;t get any more on his chest or his back.  Well, he hadn&#39;t really seen his back yet.  Grabbing a hand mirror from one of the sinks, he held it up and turned his back to one of the tall mirrors.  Using the double reflection, he could see his back was completely smooth, free of both hair (thank goodness) and tattoos (a little disappointing).  He didn&#39;t mind a little hair on his chest, but on the back it was just gross.  Speaking of hair...<br />
<br />
Will searched through the drawers and cabinets until he found his father&#39;s electric razor.  Now that he had facial hair for the first time in his life, he wanted to take advantage of it.  He was tempted to use an actual razor and shaving cream, but he didn&#39;t want to risk cutting himself on his first time.  Maybe later.  Will deliberated for a moment on just what style to give himself.  He decided to keep it simple and try a goatee with mustache and sideburns.  Just how hard could it be?  Harder than he thought.<br />
<br />
He flicked on the razor and began to cut away at his new found facial hair, tentatively at first.  He found it difficult to keep both sides even.  He wanted long sideburns, reaching down to the bottom of his jaw, but kept making one side too short, so he would try to even them out, but made the other side too short as well.  They ended up reaching just up to the length of his earlobe.<br />
<br />
As he worked, the curse activated, sensing Will was taking too much enjoyment in his maturity.  He began progressing from nineteen to twenty-one years old.  Now that he was at the edge of puberty, the changes would be more subtle, but the curse had a way of throwing extras in to go along with the situation, much like it had with the tattoos.  Will grew ever so slightly taller, reaching his final height.  His musculature became just the tiniest bit more defined as the last of his baby fat melted away.  Then the hair on his body began to thicken.  The line of hair on his abdomen spread out, covering more of his stomach.  The hair on his chest thickened, fluffing out a bit and fanning up past his collar bones and up to his shoulders.  The hair on his arms thickened as well, becoming darker and longer, spreading up his hands and onto his knuckles.  It also thickened on his upper arms, and spread up his shoulders meeting with the rest of his body hair.  A patch of hair appeared at the belt line of his back and spread up his spine and onto his shoulder blades before meeting with the hair on his shoulders.  It spread out, covering most of his back in a fine layer of hair.  The same happened on his thighs, legs, and feet.  Will&#39;s facial hair thickened as well, causing the shadow in the already shaved areas to darken another degree and his sideburns to thicken and grow out, along with the hair on his chin.<br />
<br />
But, so engrossed was Will in trying to get his facial fur sculpted the way he wanted, he wasn&#39;t quite aware of the changes as they happened.  Or, perhaps, that&#39;s just the way the curse wanted it.  Will suddenly felt more confident in his shaving now.  The now twenty-one year old found getting his goatee shaped up to be simpler than the sideburns.  He shaved the hair off the underside of his chin and neck and took a step back to take a look at his first goatee.  That&#39;s when he noticed the rest of him.  Will&#39;s eyes grew wide as he noticed the new density of hair that coated his front side.  He hadn&#39;t had body hair very long, but he knew for a fact it hadn&#39;t been like that when he started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
He ran his hands up and down his torso, feeling the new hair growth.  Before it had been masculine and sexy, but now it was too much!  He inspected his arms and followed the growth past his elbow, up to his shoulder... and down his back.  He immediately picked up the hand mirror again and tried to get a look at his back.  He could see his back was now covered in a fine layer of hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot;</p>
