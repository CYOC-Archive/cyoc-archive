<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claire walked in the locker room.  &quot;So here you all are,&quot; the redhead said.  &quot;Joe, I don't know why, but I really need you to fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know,&quot; I said.  &quot;We all know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; she asked.  For what was hopefully the second to last time, I explained my actions of Friday night and the changes that had happened to her four friends.  I intimated that she was in trouble, too.  &quot;Oh, no.&quot;  She shook her head violently.  &quot;Oh, I don't care right now.  I need to be fucked.  Now!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, alright then,&quot; I said as her clothes disappeared.  My cock sprang to attention.  She walked up to me and sat on my lap, straddling my body.  Trisha was reluctant to let go of my arm, but Claire pushed her away.  I patted Trisha on the back, hoping she would understand it as a message to be calm for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
To be honest I did not take too much pleasure in fucking Claire right now.  I was still very mad with what she had said, though she would soon pay for that.  Even so I wished that both she and I would come quickly.  It only took a few minutes for us to climax simultaneously, just like all the prior fuckings of the day.  <br />
<br />
I pulled out of her, but she remained sitting on my lap.  &quot;So,&quot; she said, &quot;What are you going to do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to be honest, Claire,&quot; I said.  &quot;I'm very angry with you.  All of your friends here didn't say anything about me, but you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
She tried to play the innocent game.  &quot;I was talking more about your mother--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's even worse,&quot; I snapped.  &quot;How dare you criticize her?  You have no right.  What would you say if I told you the reason she got pregnant at such a young age is because she was raped!&quot;  I had never told this to anyone before.  Now all of them knew.  I heard some of them mumble &quot;Oh my God.&quot;  Trisha suddenly threw her arms around me and hugged me tightly.  <br />
<br />
Claire stood up, a look of utter terror on her face.  &quot;Joe, I-I...&quot;  I didn't know what she was trying to say.  She exhaled.  &quot;I've become everything I hated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I used to hate people who made fun of others.  Especially in the way we did on Friday.  But, obviously, I've become like that myself.  I deserve whatever you're going to do to me,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
I was a little surprised by her remorse.  But it did not change what I had in store for her.  &quot;Claire, your remorse surprises me.  Either you're lying, or you really mean what you say.  I belive you're being sincere.&quot;  She looked somewhat relieved.  &quot;But, I'm not changing my mind about what to do to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is that?&quot; she asked, worried again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to become a teenage mother,&quot; I said as I made the wish in my head.  &quot;Exactly what you don't want to be.  Maybe you'll learn your lesson this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, God,&quot; she said.  She clutched her stomach.  &quot;I...I can feel it,&quot; she marvelled.  &quot;I'm pregnant.&quot;  She staggered around the room a bit, probably feeling a bit dizzy.  &quot;I think I'm going to throw up,&quot; she said.  <br />
<br />
She did.  &quot;Oh, gross,&quot; Lindsey groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; I said, wishing that the mess would disappear.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Claire said.  &quot;You would do the same.  Oh, God, this feels weird.&quot;  We watched as her breasts, which already looked a little too big on her small body, started to swell.  &quot;Ahhh,&quot; she moaned as a bit of a smile appeared on her face.<br />
<br />
The baby inside her was growing.  Her flat stomach was starting to show the signs of her pregnancy.  Her skin stretched and became flabby.  However, it quickly filled as the baby grew bigger, ballooning her stomach to immense proportions.  She groaned in pain and agony, undergoing several months of pregnancy in just a few moments.  Her belly stopped growing at what appeared to be 7 or 8 months of growth.  <br />
<br />
She regained her composure.  She looked down at herself and marvelled.  &quot;I'm pregnant,&quot; she whispered.  She ran her hands over her stomach, feeling how her skin had stretched.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel...OK now, I guess,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; I said, &quot;How do you feel about being pregnant now?&quot;<br />
<br />
She thought for a minute.  &quot;I don't know,&quot; she said.  &quot;I never wanted to be pregnant this young.  I still don't.  But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;But somehow,&quot; she smiled a bit.  &quot;I couldn't be happier.  Somehow I feel...at ease.&quot;  I knew why that was.  As part of my wish to make her pregnant, I wished that she would feel OK with being pregnant, since I would be there to take care of her.  &quot;What am I going to do for clothes now?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't need any,&quot; I said.  She asked why and I explained to her how I made a wish for her to be naked now, just like Trisha, Lindsey, and Katie.  &quot;You don't have to worry about feeling the elements or stepping on anything harmful, stuff like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the bell rang.  I wished I was dressed again, and my watch, which had disappeared along with my clothes, reappeared.  It was 3:00.  The school day was over.  &quot;Jeez, time flies,&quot; I said.  &quot;And I haven't even gotten to Erika yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do to her?&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see,&quot; I said.  &quot;OK, here's the deal.  We're all going to Erika's house after school.  We'll finish everything there.&quot;  I instructed Lindsey and Katie to drive to Erika's house together and wait for me.  I wished that Erika would go straight home and wait for us, knowing we were all coming.  Mia and Trisha would follow me home and take me to Erika's house from there.  I had to pick up a certain ex-criminal.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go then,&quot; I said.  The girls all left.  Claire walked gingerly, so I wished that she would be able to walk comfortably despite her added girth.  Trisha was the last person to walk towards the door.  Before she could leave, I grabbed her by the elbow, and spun her around to face me.</p>
