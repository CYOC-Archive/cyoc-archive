<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You lie there, empty, waiting a new wearer to glide into you. All of your vision is jet-black latex, your own underwear body stretched out before you and fully encompassing your vision. you can feel your backside laying there on your old satin sheets, your rubber front resting on its back. You can tell you are not folded up but the empty air resting on your glossy rubber skin doesn&#39;t really tingle much, though the rubber on rubber feeling is at least something. Though you feel without a wearer you are incomplete. A dickless, anusless, hollow rubber skin, of a man&#39;s crotch and ass. You are hungry and want the void inside you to be filled. It is your only true desire. With no movement in or on you and no ability to move on your own your blissful rubber squeals and moans cannot radiate in your mind and vibrate you to your core. You need a wearer so very very badly. Your senses cannot give you the bliss you once felt without someone to drive your experience. You are just a pair of underwear after all, a very nice, high quality pair of shiny black rubber men&#39;s briefs. <br />
<br />
You lay there for hours... days... weeks? You can&#39;t really comprehend any real sense of time. It feels like it was just maybe a few seconds ago that you turned into your rubber underwear. The experience still feels fresh in your mind, and you feel just like new, with only the overwhelming and all encompassing wafts of your own latex body to permeate your  sight and sense of smell. The smell, oh how you love the smell... Latex is intoxicating, but then again, that&#39;s all you are now... Love for your form is only natural... But alas, enjoying the sight and smell of your own bodies endless black rubber, you don&#39;t seem to understand any idea how long you may have or been laying here. The light shimmering over your body... From what you can barely remember, the lamp you had over your bed must be how your vision is able to see your glossiness radiating on you. It&#39;s weird, your vision is as if your whole rubber skin was an eye, plastered to the edge of a mirror, so it can only see and envision itself no matter how or where it tries to look. You know you lay on top of red satin sheets, but you cannot see them. Its hard for you to even imagine them if you didn&#39;t remember what your bed looked like. Only feel them. You have to remember the look of your room to get any vision of the world around your tiny latex body. Though you do seem to not be able to see yourself from any angle, its all at once, you can&#39;t properly make out your leg holes or waist gap for a body to fit inside you from. Just nothing but the vision of your own latex rubber underwear warped and wrapped around to encompass your entire view of sight. You can&#39;t move it, when you do the perception of your underwear changes but it is still all you can see, like rolling around inside of a black rubber reflective ball, your vision spins round and round inside of your rubber body, but no matter what you try, the warped field of vision is nothing but shiny black rubber, warped into underwear form. <br />
<br />
The same seems to be with your ears, only able to hear the inside of your latex rubber skin. If someone did grab or pull or stretch you, your latex would vibrate and sing as it stretched. The noise would be all encompassing and engorging of your non-existent ears. But its the smell and the taste that truly gives you your endless rubbery euphoria. Its all you can smell. Latex. Its all you can taste, Latex! Latex, latex and more latex! Your tongue is your own rubber body. Strange that you cannot taste the sheets, they are completely tasteless. But the rubber of your own skin is constant and fresh. It makes you love every second of your taste, and the wafting smell radiates through you entirely, just like your tongue, your nose completely melded into every single square inch of the underwear&#39;s latex. It&#39;s all you can smell. Those sheets you rest on have no recollection of smell to you. You are completely enveloped in your rubber underwear experience. Its all you are now. And all you ever will be.<br />
<br />
You continue to lay there for what to you feels like it was only another second, but you vaguely get the feeling that this experience has been ongoing for some unknown specified amount of time, but it has definitely not been a second. Again you question if it has been hours, days, weeks or months since you turned into a pair of rubber underwear, but to you it still feels like it was just a second ago you finished becoming fully transformed. You shake yourself lose from the thoughts on the flow of time and begin to focus again on yourself, your body is so... very... empty... You really do feel like you are solely meant to be an extension to a body that is not yet inside you. You badly want one. You try to cry out for someone, anyone to come find you and slip you over their body. You lose your thoughts in the idea of the all-encompassing feeling of being pulled over a man&#39;s hairy legs, or perhaps smooth ones... what if its not a man? The thoughts thrill you as you silently lay there and enjoy your imagination with glee. You want to feel yourself squeal with glee as you reach the apex of his legs and his or perhaps her ass swells your rubber out and slides into your own, then your mind thinks about the crotch, a massive, hard, throbbing cock to fill your rubber front, the idea of being stressed tightly by the pillar of flesh inside you makes you only want it more, but the idea of a pussy rubbing you and squeaking its way into your front is also sooo appealing. You don&#39;t really care if a man or a woman wears you, but you need to be worn. All of this mental masturbation is doing nothing for your rubbery senses, you gain no joy from what you imagine, only longing and excitement for it to happen. Your rubber body will gain nothing and will remain motionless until it is used. And its the usury you fully desire.<br />
<br />
You calm back down as thoughts and desires will get you no-where. with a silent sigh in your mind, you once again must accept you are just a pair of underwear, and must wait to be worn. But the longing of being worn is what is truly gnawing at you. You need a body inside you so very very badly. Your own hysteria from the visions you give yourself from time to time in your timeless rubber mind are also becoming less and less appealing as you need the psychical thing. You feel as if you are starving without a body to wear you and it is the only thing you need. You are growing impatient trying to resist your needs. Its about time you had a body to touch you on your insides.<br />
<br />
You continue to lay there in your unknown specified rubbery space and time, you love your rubber body more than anything and your feelings of being human are uninteresting and you wish them to fade, you could remain as rubber underwear forever but your desires and needs are beginning to drive you insane, you can take not being worn any longer.</p>
