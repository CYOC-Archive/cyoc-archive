<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the next morning when Seph but even with all 10 hours of sleep he was still grumpy as he was never a morning person. Yawning tiredly and scratching the itches and aches he had gained over the strange night, Seph started to think about how he had, had such a strange dream about himself turning into some kind of cat person with a dog dick. Shivering at the thought, Seph got up from his bed and noticed that his balance was slightly off for some reason. Curious as to what was causing it, Seph looked down to see what the problem was only to get a face full of dog dick blocking his vision. Falling backwards in surprise, Seph started to hyperventilate in panic before the same feeling as before forced him to calm down against his will and letting him think rationally.<br />
‘So my apparent nightmare wasn’t a dream a but rather real things that happened and i’m now stuck in this horrible form.’<br />
Seph already knew he could try more vegetables but he didn’t want to risk it and change into an even worse form. Getting up and gathering his to put on and feel somewhat normal, Seph could both hear and feel his stomach growling for him to feed himself though he was afraid that he would change again. Unable to handle the feeling of his stomach turning inside out any longer, Seph cautiously stepped to the meat and cheese box trying to stay as far away from the fruit and veggies box as he could. Eating a quick regenerating meal, Seph grabbed his new bag and canteen as well as a few strips of whatever kind of jerky he grabbed first and left the tent to see the outside world. Just like yesterday, everything was a barren wasteland and inhospitable to even the most hardy of plant life. Unsure of what to do, Seph just stood there wondering.<br />
‘I could try and stay here and with my food and water I should be fine but I don’t want to spend the rest of my life stuck in some tent.’<br />
Remembering the shield from yesterday, Seph quickly went back inside to grab one of the two before pulling a large rusted dagger from the weapons rack. Now equipped with some form of protection, Seph took his first step into the barren wasteland much like Wulf-rick had done so the day before. Slowly Seph made his way across the landscape, jumping in fear from every screech he heard whether near or far. After an hour of walking and no real change occuring besides his camp turning into a smaller and smaller dot in the distance, Seph figured it would be best to just turn back and hope someone comes along but right as he turned to retrace his steps, a large object collided with his back causing him to land face first on the ground while the object continued to sit on him. Fearing for his life again, Seph started to struggle until he finally threw what ever had landed on him away and turned to face it. What he saw was both familiar and disgusting at the same time as he was now looking at an almost exact duplicate of Zetaz only this one was naked showing off his disproportionate foot long cock to the world. Another difference Seph had noticed that the demon looked to be in some kind of frenzy like state as it continued to garbe uncontrollably. One thing was clearly obvious to Seph at that moment though, he had to kill the demon then and there or get raped by the tiny demon. Not one to just submit and lose especially to something so terrifying, Seph quickly grabbed his shield but noticed that his dagger had been thrown back farther behind which would leave him open if he tried to go for it. With nothing left to do, Seph braced his shield with his other hand and charged the frenzied demon. The demon though knew that he wasn’t just going to get a sexual encounter so easily even with a lust addled mind and proceeded to jump into the air and catching wind with his tiny wings and started making strange hand gestures towards Seph. Unsure of what those gestures met, Seph noticed that he was starting to get an erection though it was still mostly soft. Not liking how things were going, Seph tried to make the demon come down and into reach.<br />
“Come on you overgrown chicken, where are your balls at, did you lose them when you got that surgery to actually have more than an inch of a penis?”<br />
The insult did the trick making the the demon dive bomb straight into Seph’s shield. It was at this moment that Seph noticed something strange, even with his new bow legged lower body and being on the small side in weight and muscle, he was able to hold back the imps charge. While the imp continued to try and run over Seph fur covered body, Seph saw an opportunity and proceeded to spin like a matador but instead of letting the imp simply pass, Seph twisted the position of his shield making him smack the demon to the ground. Pressing on his advantage, Seph jumped on top of the naked demon and started to bash the edge of his shield into the demon’s skull over and over again until suddenly the demon exploded into literal red powder leaving behind a small packet of crackers and a few gems like the ones back at his camp. Leaving the packet alone, Seph picked up the gems and placed them in his bag before going to pick up his dagger.<br />
Feeling much more confident in himself, Seph couldn’t help but now notice the new definition to his muscles that he hadn’t before with all the fur covering his body. Happy with the at least one aspect of his new form, Seph continued onwards  to hopefully find more the evil imps to kill. None showed up causing Seph to become dismayed as the night started to roll in and Seph realized the mistake he had made by travelling so far without thought of where he was or where the camp was. Panicking for the third time that day Seph started running around more in the dark hopping to spot his camp in the distance with the help of the red moon’s light. Suddenly without warning, Seph found his leg to be caught in one of the many traps that surrounded his camp. Both relieved and confused on how he had found it so quickly, Seph cut himself out from one of the many snare traps that existed promising to fix it in the morning before entering his tent. Once inside, Seph place his dagger and shield away before hopping into bed to fall asleep. Sleep came with trouble though as Seph remembered his encounter with the demon and how he was only able to survive thanks to the veggies he had eaten. Thinking of the veggies now, Seph started to wonder what other transformations they could hold until he remembered that those transforming peppers and peaches had come from the chest filled with all assortments of unknown liquids.<br />
‘I wonder if any of them can turn me back into a human?”<br />
With that questioned lodged in his mind, Seph fell asleep only to wake up the next day surprisingly refreshed even while his mood was soured. Realizing that he had forgotten to brush his teeth the other day Seph started to worry about how he could lose his teeth and started looking all over the tent for some kind of substitute. Eventually Seph had only one last place to look and that was the potions chest. Seph tried to think of some reason not to open it even with all the possible pros it could have but the temptation was to much. Opening the chest, Seph looked through it once more and was dejected to see that no form of toothpaste was there only bottles with picture on them such as one with what looked to be the shadow of some kind of sexual demon lady posing for the drinker, or another that had the picture of a cow on it. The potion that caught his attention the most though was one that had the picture of a shadowed buff man and that was about it. Remembering the newfound strength from the last day, Seph hopped for the best and started to chug the bottle. Stopping to finally catch his breath, Seph saw the bottle to still be full making him unsure how much he had actually drank. Those thoughts didn’t last long though as a warm sensation spread throughout his body like the day before though without the sudden increase in lust to hamper his thought process.<br />
Curious if the picture was to be believed, Seph was happy to see that his wiry muscles were starting to grow in size and definition until stopping at the size of a man who went to the gym a few time more than he should but still nowhere near the size of a bodybuilder. Happy with the change in muscles, Seph planned to go out again and hope to find another demon to kill. That plan stopped though as he felt two more surges of heat that gather at the end of his tailbone and the base of his cock. Like with the peppers, Seph’s cock changed again though not in size but rather in species as it became that of a horses with a sheath and everything while his backside grew what looked to be a horses tail. With his changes now done, Seph wasn’t sure how to react before just shrugging and gathering the same items as yesterday but including a sword as well so as to have some sort of secondary weapon should he lose his first for some reason, and headed back out into the wasteland</p>
