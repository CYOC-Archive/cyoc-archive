<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle ran through the city in a blur, nearly reaching the apartment building he would find his luck would take a disastrous turn, he dreamed of being saddled with the body of a milf, or a body builder. Just a block before the apartment building was a convention center, it wasn&#39;t a huge one, but it still hosted some conventions from time to time. Unfortunately for Kyle it was hosting an adult entertainment convention, and he would pass it at just the wrong time.<br />
<br />
He turned the corner and saw a woman walking toward the convention center, she was slightly taller than him, her stiletto boots gave her a bit more height, she was shapely but not fat, but what stood out about her was her bust. She sported a pair of obviously enhanced breasts, each the size of a soccer ball. She was clad in a skin tight dress suit, the sexy teacher style he&#39;d seen in her videos, complete with the corset she wore as part of the ensemble that gave her tits the extra lift to make a shelf in front of her. He saw her blonde hair tied up in a pony tail and instantly recognized her from his long nights with porn.<br />
<br />
“MIAMI MOUNTAINS!?!” He shouted, and she looked at him as he crashed into her, their heads flew off and Kyle hit the ground. He felt his body groping around for his head and grab something, silently cussing as he knew what was happening, then suddenly he didn&#39;t feel his body anymore. “What the fuck?” He heard his old voice say as he felt the feminine hands grab his head, suddenly his head was connected to her body and he felt the tremendous weight of her breasts on his chest. He looked down and gulped, seeing her iconic rose tattoo on his new left breast, he had little time to react as his new body grabbed his head and tried to pull it off.<br />
<br />
After a minute it gave up and let him have control. “Yeah kid, I think this is permanent.” He looked up and saw Miami&#39;s slightly larger head on his body. “I worked hard to get to that size you know.” She said to him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but think of the opportunities.” Her co star said as she walked to them. “All the tranny and step mom videos we could make.” <br />
<br />
“And I get to start all over again with the implants.” She looked over to him and smiled, “Or not. Their yours now kid, have fun with them, I know you will.” They walked off leaving Kyle in the parking lot with his new, extremely sexy porn body. He stared down at his new tits and whimpered, just his rotten luck, he&#39;d have to deal with this for the rest of his life. Kyle sighed, and started walking home, it was obvious he&#39;d not be able to get to school on time by now. He felt his new massive bust bouncing with every step, as he got halfway their he saw his mother parking her car at the bank where she worked. She looked up and gasped.<br />
<br />
“KYLE?” She stared at him in shock. “WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? WHOSE BODY IS THAT? WHY ARE YOU DRESSED LIKE A WHORE?” Kyle stumbled through an answer, explaining the event, he was about to get to the curse when she cut him off. “Well that serves you right for running through town like that! Now look at you!” She walked over and cupped his breasts. “These are massive!” She sounded a little envious, “Well, let&#39;s go, you have to get to school.”<br />
<br />
“But...” <br />
<br />
“No buts, just because you switched bodies, it doesn&#39;t mean you can slack off. No son...” She glanced over. “Daughter of mine is going to miss school just because she couldn&#39;t watch were she was going.” They got into the car and she drove him to school, all the while glancing over at her son&#39;s new body, on occasion reaching over to grope one of his tits, commenting on the size of them, asking “Why this body?” “Why not something normal?” “Are you into women like this?” She dropped Kyle off at school with a note for the front office.<br />
<br />
Kyle walked into the building and to the office, there he was met with a couple of gasps as he gave the note to the secretary. She looked up at him, past his bust, and smiled.<br />
<br />
“We can excuse this, it&#39;s not like people loose their heads everyday now is it?” She poked one of his breasts, “Now get along young lady, class is in session.” Kyle walked out of the office as he heard them start talking about him, “Did you see the size of her boobs?!?” “Oh yes, she must be delighted, I wish I could get an upgrade that quick.” “I wonder if that body has done porn before.” “We have to look.”<br />
<br />
Kyle blushed, his fetish was now a reality, mortified, embarrassed and feeling his new pussy twitch a little, he walked down the hall to his second class, having missed the first. Stepping into the classroom, his teacher stopped. “Mister... Misses Perkins, good of you to join us.” The entire classroom gawked at the sight. “Please take your seat.” She turned and continued writing on the board, blushing deeply as she did. Kyle walked over to his desk and sat down, his new mountainous breasts filled most of the area in front of him, resting slightly on the desk, he felt a hand touch one of them, the girl next to him reached over.<br />
<br />
“Now class, we&#39;ll have time later to address Miss Perkins... upgrade...” She continued on with her lesson as Kyle tried to and failed to sink into his now ill fitting desk. Too large to hide and no way to escape Kyle felt the eyes upon him and started to get a little wet down below. How could he deal living with this from now on?</p>
