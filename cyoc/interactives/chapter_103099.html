<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> “What now?” I asked curiously as a strange tugging sensation formed at the base of my spine and on my forehead.  I could feel more shifting in my mouth and fingers as well, making me very curious as to what Penny had just done to me.  Staring at my fingernails, I was startled to see that they were longer and sharper.  They looked more like claws than fingernails.  Almost afraid to look, I checked out the base of my spine, finding that I had some sort of tail underneath the robe.  “What the hell?”<br />
<br />
Penny giggled at that, saying, “Exactly.”  <br />
<br />
Pulling my robe back a bit, I could see my tail clearly.  It was long thing and red, with a barbed tip on the end.  A somewhat stereotypical devils tail.  Already suspecting what I was going to find, my hand went up to my forehead and met a pair of horns.<br />
<br />
“Funny,” I said, going over to the mirror again and gasping.  I had a tail swinging out from the bottom of my robe, and the horns on my forehead.  Smiling, I could see the fangs that grown in my mouth, making me look rather sinister.  So did the red demonic eyes I now possessed.  Grinning mischieviously to myself, I quickly turned to Penny and demanded, “Give me your soul mortal!”  <br />
<br />
Penny squeaked some noise out, actually looking scared for a moment until I smiled reassuringly back at her, though that didn’t seem to settle her down completely.<br />
<br />
“Shit you look hot,” Brandon said, staring in earnest.  He looked a little nervous staring at me as well.  Feeling somewhat smug, I walked past Brandon as suggestively as I could, making sure to wag the tail where it was visible, and I gave Penny a deep kiss, which she hesitated on at first but started to return.  “Wow, lessie action,” Brandon snickered and I swatted him gently with my tail.<br />
<br />
Seeing that Brandon and Penny were both still uncomfortable with my current appearance, I smiled to myself and enjoyed it.  It was kind of fun, I had to admit as I examined my tail closer.  Penny seemed satisfied though that she’d seen enough of me like that and was ready to see something else.  With some disappointment I said good bye to that form.<br />
<br />
The next change however was no less drastic, though in an opposite direction.  The wings that grew from my back forced me to throw off the robe, much to Brandon’s glee.  But when it was done, I reached back, amazed at the soft feathers that met my hands.  I had a pair of large white wings growing from my back, and I hurried to see myself in the mirror.  I looked like an angel.  <br />
<br />
“Oh God I love this,”  Brandon moaned, obviously about to cream his pants.  “Are you sure you don’t want to try it?” he asked hopefully.  “I’ve never had any complaints yet.”  I stuck out my tongue, then just to annoy him I went over and gave Penny a kiss.<br />
<br />
Brandon frowned, then told Penny, “My turn,” taking the medallion from her.  I cringed, suddenly wondering just what Brandon’s perverted mind would come up with next.  I didn’t have to wait long as the wings shrunk and faded and I was back to just being the blonde girl.  Then Brandon got a wicked gleam in his eyes that made me groan.  I felt a strange sensation coming from the middle of my chest, and looked down in shock to see that I was growing a third breast.  Right in between the other two.  It stopped at about the same size.<br />
<br />
“Damn this feels weird,” I said, pinching the nipple of my new breast.  I felt just like the other two.  Just as real.  The added weight was noticeable though and I started to wonder just how girls with big tits can manage having them around all the time.  It wasn’t like they could ever take them off when they got too heavy.  Several minutes later, my middle breasts started shrinking again as Brandon had another idea.  I watched it shrink with somewhat mixed feelings.  It certainly had felt interesting, though I was relieved to have the extra weight gone.<br />
<br />
Next however I felt the tingling and some pushing underneath my breasts.  Reaching down with my hands, I felt another set of nipples which were still pushing outward.  <br />
<br />
“Shit,” I cried as my two new breasts grew in under the ones I already had.  “What are you trying to do?” I demanded of Brandon.  “Turn me into a cow?”  <br />
<br />
He just laughed and Penny giggled as well, obviously amused by how strange I must look having 4 boobs. Putting my hands on the top ones, then moving them to the lower ones,  I remembered how good they had felt to be played with by Penny and couldn’t help but wondering how much better an extra pair might feel.  Sighing, I knew that as long as Brandon was around I wasn’t going to find out.  I may have looked like a girl, but I still had absolutely no intention of sleeping with a guy.  Especially him.<br />
<br />
“That doesn’t look right,” Penny told Brandon, who nodded his head in agreement.<br />
<br />
“You’re right,” he said looking thoughtful.  “But I think I have a solution.”  Just then I could feel something just under my arms, and I winced as I realized just what they were.  I was growing another pair or arms.  Within a very short time, I had an extra pair of arms underneath my original ones.  “Now you can play with all of them at once,” Brandon said with a big smirk.  Man I wished that I’d put the ring on him.<br />
<br />
Still I thought, as I touched all four of my breasts at the same time, this definitely could have some possibilities.  Especially if I could somehow get the ring off and onto Penny.  By the look on her face, I guessed that she was thinking the same thing I was.</p>
