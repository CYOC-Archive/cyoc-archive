<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her skull was bigger and seemed soft like an octopus. The tentacles that were holding onto his neck were her arms. They were at least ten feet long. Her face was somewhat the same, but her eyes were bigger and had squared pupils. Her mouth seemed the same, but that proved wrong when she licked her lips with a tongue that resembled a smooth tentacle, reaching the impossible length of a foot. <br />
“What happened to you! You are more like an octopus now and your body don’t seem to have any bones anymore!”<br />
Mary coughed the water that filled her lungs before speaking.<br />
“I think that the pictures we saw were wrong.” She said surprisingly well for someone with that kind of tongue.<br />
“What changed while you were underwater?” Jeff asked, curious.<br />
“Well, my arms became tentacles too.” She said as she waved her arm for him. “My vision became better underwater; I felt my bones softening and finally my teeth receded. I think I don’t have a single bone on my body now.”<br />
“And can you get out of the pool? How will you cope with these changes now?”<br />
“The box said the changes last for 24 hours. Tomorrow at this time I will be me again. As your concern about me getting out of the pool, I think I can. Let’s see.”<br />
Mary reached the border and soon Jeff saw several tentacles climbing it. He got out the pool as soon as Mary released him and saw Mary step out. She was now much shorter than before, but soon her body grew and became somewhat solid again. Her two upper tentacles became arms again and she stood up using her eight tentacle legs.<br />
“I think this is getting better and better!” Mary said. “I have a dry form too!” She said while testing her arms and wobbling while standing on her tentacles. She was now as tall as Jeff and embraced him on a passionate kiss.<br />
“Wow!” Jeff said as they separated. “Do you have any other surprises for me?”<br />
“Who knows…” Mary said as she licked her lips with a foot-long tongue. <br />
“Can you control these changes?”<br />
“Let’s get inside and I show you what I can do.”<br />
Mary dragged Jeff into their bedroom and told him to lie down on the bed.<br />
“And how do you know what you can do?”<br />
“It seems that the changes are provided with an instruction manual. I know everything about my new body, but I am still me here.” Mary said as she tapped her head.<br />
“Now let’s get more action. As you saw, I can control almost everything on my body now. I can change the shape of my body between my dry shape…” She turned herself in front of Jeff, showing her body. “and my wet shape.” She said as her body lost all her bones and she laid on the floor. She climbed their bed and soon was over Jeff’s belly. “What do you think? Oh! You don’t need to answer that! I can see that little Jeff wants some action too!” Mary said when she saw Jeff’s erection. <br />
Mary changed into her dry shape and held Jeff with her legs. She leaned on him and kissed him passionately while her tentacles moved around his body until their center was over his cock.<br />
“I think you didn’t see it yet, but I have a pussy that is too wet just now!” Mary said as she lowered her body and impaled herself on his erect member. <br />
Mary moaned when Jeff entered her and then kissed him again. She used her long tongue to probe his mouth while changed her arms back to tentacles and embraced Jeff. She pumped her body against his dick with increasing passion. <br />
She moaned high when her first orgasm hit her and increased her pace. Jeff felt her pussy squeezing his cock and embraced Mary. He felt her body softening onto his hands and her tentacles squeeze him hard when she came again. This time he didn’t hold It anymore and came inside his wife. She screamed high with one more orgasm and collapsed over his body.<br />
“That’s too good to be true!” She said breathing each word. <br />
“Wow! You are amazing!” Jeff said as he reached what seemed to be her shoulder and tried to put her on his side. She was too slimy and he could not get a hold on her body. <br />
“You won’t be free that easily…” Mary said. “My body have the same properties of that of an octopus. I can keep myself over you even if I don’t use my suckers to hold you.”<br />
“Let’s see if that is true.” Jeff said as he pushed Mary away. <br />
They started to play and soon Jeff noticed that that was a lost battle. As much as he pushed Mary she always slipped through his fingers. It was like battling a big jelly. As soon as he lifted some part of her body, she slipped and fell over him again. <br />
“I give up!” Jeff said sometime later. “You are like a giant jelly.”<br />
“I am almost like that.” Mary said as she solidified into her dry shape. “But I am way too stronger than you now too.”<br />
“Are you stronger too? You didn’t seem to have a lot of muscles. You seem the same to me.”<br />
“But I am made of muscles now. And it seems my muscles are way stronger now.”<br />
“Then show it to me.” Jeff asked.<br />
Mary tightened her grip on Jeff’s legs and hips, changed her arms into tentacles and embraced his neck. Then Mary used four tentacles to raise herself and Jeff over the bed. She had her pussy still attached on his cock and felt it becoming harder inside her.<br />
“Little Jeff is awakening!”<br />
“This is beyond fantastic.” Jeff said. “I can’t believe you now is this strong and has this fantastic body!”</p>
