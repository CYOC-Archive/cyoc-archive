<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What a busy day,” Michael Proudhoof sighing as he trudges into the small back room of the restaurant that passes for on office. Seeing his son Jimmy at the computer, the elder Anthro stag-deer fury could tell he was already totaling the day’s receipts. He takes a seat in the second chair and watches his son quietly as he reminisces of the past.<br />
<br />
Roughly 6 years ago, he was originally a human nearly pushing senior citizen status and in morning over the passing of his wife Victoria. Michael soon became the anthro stag-deer fury he was now thanks to his twin sons passing the gift on to him. Dosing a glass of wine; he understood that his son’s were not going to jump his bones in an incestuous fashion. The fury virus may have increased one’s libido and skewed their sexual orientation to being more bisexual; however incest was something a fury found instinctively vile, as abhorrent as trying to cover up with clothes. When Michael strolled out that night trying to shake his melancholy he found his mate. Denise, a doctor at the hospital who he managed to invade her dreams with an erotic chase that resulted in her waking up as an anthro tigress fury. Now he has grand cubs thanks to his twin sons and as well as a daughter thanks to his mate Denise.<br />
<br />
“So how did we make out,” Michael coming back to the present as Jimmy finishes the last of the receipts.<br />
“Pretty good,” Jimmy nodding; “if this keeps up, we might have to consider opening a second location.”<br />
“It wouldn’t be as good as the original,” Michael shaking his head at the thought; “Plus we are already stretched thin at the moment.”<br />
“How are we stretched thin,” Jimmy turning from the computer to look at his father; noticing that Michael has yet to trim down his antlers, the rack currently at eighteen points.<br />
“Your son,” Michael getting up; “Jake’s twins and my daughter. We barely get to spend time with them with our job being busy as it is. We would have even less time,” Michael smiling; “if we opened a second location. Let’s focus on the one right now.”<br />
“Then we need to expand this place,” Jimmy turning off the computer; following the elder proudhoof as he heads back to the kitchen to watch as the staff finish cleaning. Noting that most of the surfaces were polished to a mirror finish thanks to the magic runes all furies possess; the ability to cast magic making certain tasks far easier and faster than before as a regular human. “If we had more space,” Jimmy walking into the dining room and noting the damage to some of the tables from the last incident; “then we might be able to allow some of our patrons to vent some pent up passion without being denied.”<br />
“Both buildings on either side of us are vacant,” Michael thinking; “because we don’t wear clothes, the tailor and shoe shop quickly folded, so your expansion ideal is not far off. They would have to be private rooms,” Michael picking up a busted table and concentrating: his runes glowing as the table quickly knits its self-back together. <br />
<br />
“We can discuss the possibilities later if you like,” Jimmy yawning; “I want to get home to Allison and Jimmy J.R.”<br />
“Go,” Michael nodding with a smile; “and enjoy your day off tomorrow.” Michael watches as his son leaves the restaurant; followed by the rest of the staff leaving the anthro stag-deer to lock up. Jake left an hour earlier to deal with his trouble making twins. “Now let’s get out of here,” Michael heading to his car; “hopefully I can see Roxy off to bed.”<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
The small Tiger cub peaked through the blinds as she saw a car pull into the driveway. Her tail twitching excitedly as she sees her father step out. She scrambles to a the closet that once held coats, scarves and boots by the entrance. Not it sits empty save for a couple of umbrellas that she has seen her mother use on the many rainy days of late. She leaves the door slightly ajar so she can watch her quarry enter. Waiting for him to step away, she quietly opens the door to step out. Padding on the floor with her foot-paws; being as silent as her feline namesake; with a smile she leaps and lets loose an excite roar as she clings to the back of the anthro stag-deer.<br />
“I caught you daddy,” the tigress cub squealing with joy; “now where is my prize?”<br />
<br />
Michael chuckles as he works to remove the three year old cub off of him. Lowering himself to her level as he gives the young girl the kiss she seeks.<br />
“Shouldn’t you be in bed by now Roxy,” Michael guiding the tigress cub upstairs; “its way past your bedtime.”<br />
“But I want you to read me a story,” Roxy pleading; “Mommy has been talking to her voices again.”<br />
Michael knew his mate had a demanding job that required her to keep inconvenient hours. Being the head of the CDC required her to communicate with not only the President of the United States of America as well as the director of the World Health Organization; she also had to meet with various politicians and several leaders of other countries. While she was able to deal with most of that over the phone or through voice chat on the computer, there have been some meetings/conferences that required a face to face interaction. Because of this, Denise Proudhoof has racked up enough frequent flier miles to take her mate and Roxy on a first class flight Hawaii. While Michael did find it appealing to spend a week or two in a tropical island paradise, he didn’t want to spoil Roxy with faraway places. He asked Denise to think of something closer.<br />
<br />
Opening the door to his mate’s office; formerly Jake’s room, Roxy’s room was once Jimmy’s. Michael could see his anthro tigress mate typing away as he quietly closed the door.<br />
“Roxy go to bed,” Denise hearing the door close but not turning around.<br />
“Roxy is still waiting for her story,” Michael speaking; causing Denise to turn around in surprise as she prepares to pounce him. “I already got jumped by a tigress tonight,” Michael putting up a hoof-like finger to stop Denise; “and you promised to stop work by 7pm sharp. Eight if it is an emergency,” Michael staring at the disappointed anthro kitty who was just denied her cream.<br />
“I’m sorry,” Denise shaking her head; “time must have run away from me. But you try telling the President that you have to sign off because it’s Roxy’s bath time, or family game night.”<br />
“You ever just disconnect without a word,” Michael smirking; “enough of those and they might finally except your letter of resignation. The letter on the screen, Michael looking at the monitor; “is that number ten?”<br />
“No,” Denise shaking her head as she saves the file before locking her computer; “it’s a recommendation report on how to treat the latest cholera outbreak in Haiti. The infrastructure their still has yet to be properly repaired from the last earthquake that struck the island nation in 2010 and again in 2021.<br />
“You think magic runes would help,” Michael looking at his wrists before turning his attention back to Denise; “but I take it the politicians are still just a corrupt as when they were once human?”<br />
“I can’t answer either,” Denise shrugging her shoulders; “I just focus of the outbreaks when they happen. Now if Roxy is still up, let’s put her to bed and head their ourselves.”<br />
<br />
“Alright you little munchkin,” Michael stepping into his daughter’s room; “what story do you want us to read you.”<br />
“This one,” the three year old cub picking up a large heavy book off of the floor.<br />
Michael looks at the large tomb and grimaces at the selection. “First, where did you get this book? And second, what makes you think we can get through a thousand plus pages in a single night?”<br />
“Which book are we referring to,” Denise stepping into the room; seeing the object in question, Denise bursts out laughing. “I haven’t read that since medical school.”<br />
“Your book,” Michael looking at the tigress as she takes the tomb from Michael’s hoof hands and shakes her head.<br />
“Roxy,” Denise smiling; “This fantasy book is way too big to read in one go. But there was a movie adaptation made. Perhaps we can sit down and watch it tomorrow, but I ask you pick a different book. One that doesn’t weigh a ton,” Denise gripping the hard cover lovingly.<br />
“Promise,” Roxy looking at her mom; “no calls promise?”<br />
“Yeah,” Michael grinning maniacally; “you promise mommy?”<br />
“Of course,” Denise returning the grin back at Michael; “because daddy is going to watch it with you.”<br />
“Yay,” Roxy running to the book shelf and picking a smaller book; “this one then.”<br />
<br />
“Big world little world,” Michael reading the title; “Okay then hop into bed.” Denise watches as their daughter jumps into the small bed; she outgrew her crib and dance with joy at being able to sleep in a bed. The bed having jungle theme, what with her an anthro tiger cub. A cub who has creamy brown fur  covering her belly and flat chest. The rest of her body as well as tail, has the traditional orange fur with black stripes along her body.<br />
“Planets come in all and sizes and colors,” Michael reading from the book as Roxy lies down in bed clutching a stuffed elephant. The little girl not needing a blanket as her fur is thick enough to keep her warm and comfortable. “Some worlds like ours have many unique features. Mountains, Rivers and seas. Some planets are just balls of hot gas,” Michael chuckling; pausing to see his daughter starting to close her eyes. “Some planets are too hot to the touch, while others are as cold as ice,” Michael looking to see Roxy finally asleep. Closing the book; the stag-deer get ups to put the book away as Denise turns off the light and closes the door.<br />
<br />
“And we should get some sleep as well,” Michael staring at his mate; smiling as he can feel a hand paw cradling his cervine sack. The anthro tigress rumbling with desires as she encourages Michael’s shaft to come out of hiding. “Well I know what you want,” Michael smiling; “Lets continue this in bed.”<br />
“Tie me down,” Denise leading her mate to the bedroom; “show me how much of a naughty kitty I’ve been today.”<br />
“Well,” Michael’s smile turning into a Cheshire like grin; “I can happily make that happen.” His runes glow just as the bedroom door closes and muffled moans began to sound.</p>
