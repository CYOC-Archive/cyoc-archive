<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m going to go watch some tv now&quot; Mike said out of the blue. &quot;You can mess around with that program of yours however you want so long as it doesn&#39;t affect me or my baby vacation. Oh and before you do anything make it so we have more money, a nicer house, all the baby stuff I would need, lots of toys to play with and a live in caretaker to look after me&quot; he summarized quickly then stuck his thumb in his mouth and toddled off in the direction of the living room, his padded behind crinkling behind him. Jeff just stood there for a few moments after the toddler left before shaking off the weirdness and heading back to his desk.<br />
<br />
Sitting down Jeff stared at his keyboard, cracked his knuckles and then set to work on his dad&#39;s list of requests. First he changed their financial situation so they were now rich enough that his father no longer had to work and could retire early if he wanted to. It was the least he could do after everything his dad went especially since his mom left. Next he gave them a better house, a bigger two story suburban one that upper middle class people have. It also had three more rooms and two more baths then their old one had. With the addition of more rooms Jeff selected one and turned it into a nursery fit for his regressed father. Finally he tackled the last item on the list and got them a live-in female caretaker to watch after his dad for however long he was regressed. After double checking everything for any mistakes or typos Jeff hit the execute button. There was a flash as the room around him changed, becoming bigger and more luxurious. He still had all his old stuff with the addition of some new things like nicer furniture and a bigger tv. His desktop computer even got an upgrade, becoming a nicer and more expensive model than the previous one.<br />
<br />
Getting up from his chair Jeff left his room to inspect the house, going from room to to room to see the changes he made. Everything was mostly the same save for the new furniture added to furnish the new spaces. When he found the nursery it was exactly as he had ordered with all the necessities, a crib, a changing table, a dresser and a box full of toys; just like his dad wanted. Speaking of his father Jeff decided he should check on the little guy to make sure he was still doing alright on his own.<br />
<br />
Heading downstairs he entered into the new living room to find the toddler in a very interesting position. The two year old was currently lying on his back with his legs raised and his naked butt on display, with said butt being currently wiped by a young woman with long brown hair. The bottle of baby powder and the pack of wipes nearby further evidence that his father was getting his diaper changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey there Jeff. Just changing your dad here as someone wound up making a boom-boom while they were watching cartoons&quot; the woman teased as she tossed the dirtied wipes into the old diaper and wrapped it up. Mike who had his head turned to the side to continue watching his show while being changed, broke out of his distraction upon hearing his son&#39;s name. Looking up at Jeff with a big grin on his face he said, &quot;Hi Jeff, great work with the house! And I see you&#39;ve met Karen here, don&#39;t mind her she is just changing me cause I ended up making a big stinky&quot; Mike replied with a giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right you&#39;re just a little pants loader aren&#39;t you&quot; Karen said reaching down to tickle the baby boy&#39;s chubby belly, eliciting a few giggles from the toddler. Unfolding and slipping a brand new diaper under him she started sprinkling some baby powder. Jeff was thankful for that step as the sweet lavender scent got rid of the lingering odor hanging in the air which had been grossing him out. &quot;You know with the way your father acts it&#39;s hard to believe he&#39;s an adult who was regressed due to a virus. But if you&#39;re going to be stuck as a baby I guess you learn to love acting the part&quot; she smiled as she taped up the new pair of padding. That comment made Jeff realize the Chronoivac must have changed reality to explain why his dad had suddenly became two since he didn&#39;t click the alter reality button. However since his dad still got to get treated his age he figured it was okay to keep it this way for now.<br />
<br />
With the change now completed Karen gathered up the supplies in the diaper bag and the dirty diaper for disposal. &quot;Well I got other things to do around the house. I&#39;ll see you boys later&quot; she winked playfully before exiting the room. Now that they were alone Jeff looked down at his freshly diapered father who had since stood up. &quot;So everything good?&quot; he asked. The little boy eagerly nodded. &quot;Better than good. I&#39;m actually really getting used to being in diapers again&quot; Mike answered giving his padded behind a shake for emphasis. &quot;I can see that&quot; Jeff replied referring to the change just moments ago and remembering how content and relaxed his dad was with it taking place. &quot;Yeah, never knew how great it was to not have to worry about the bathroom or having someone else clean up after you&quot; Mike remarked. &quot;Well I just came to check on how you were doing with your baby vacation and I can see you&#39;re good so...&quot; &quot;Yeah Karen got everything covered so you&#39;re free to do what you want. Go have fun Jeff&quot; his dad said before toddling over and plopping his padded behind down on the floor as he resumed watching his cartoons with his thumb returning to his mouth. Leaving his father to his tv view Jeff returned to his room and sat in front of his computer where the Chronoivac program was still running.<br />
<br />
As he gazed at the various options with which he could alter his life Jeff&#39;s thoughts were still muddled with images of his toddler father and his diaper dependent joy. Ultimately he starts typing on his keyboard having decided to...</p>
