<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate casually played video games while fondling Brad’s dick. Even Brad, who was lurching in pleasure could not move. Nate was too strong and held him with four arms. <br />
<br />
After an hour, Brad had emptied his dick. His pant were soaked and sticky. However, Brad now had to use his penis for something else. <br />
<br />
“Hey uh,” Brad said softly. “I uh need to use the restroom.”<br />
<br />
“Ok,” Nate said. He didn’t move. His feet masterfully managed to play Halo. <br />
<br />
“Are you going to get up?” Nate asked. <br />
<br />
Not wanting to be awkward, Brad did. He stood up, the arms around him dispersing. Nate dropped the controller and Brad felt a sharp tug on his dick that almost made him trip. Nate has let go of his body, but not his dick. <br />
<br />
Brad walked awkwardly as Nate followed with his hand firmly wrapped around Brad’s cock. He didn’t seem to care as Brad entered the bathroom and lowered his pants. <br />
<br />
And there it was. A fist the size of a bowling ball. Wrapped tightly around a cock. Brad struggled, but managed to urinate. It was at this moment that he realized that he had to take a shit as well. <br />
<br />
Brad could make Nate stop. But this was interesting. <br />
<br />
“You’ve never let go of my cock ever have you?” Brad said. <br />
<br />
“From birth yes,” Nate said without hesitation. <br />
<br />
This made Brad extremely uncomfortable. But he was too horny to care too much. Now with that in place, he would try and halt the unstoppable force in anyway possible. <br />
<br />
As he sat down, the arm reached into the toilet bowl with him and Nate stood above him. Brad was astounded at the size and muscle of this five armed man. He didn’t even seem to care about what he was doing. <br />
<br />
Brad finished and went to clean himself up. After all, he couldn’t go out with cum all over himself. He quickly went into the shower and tried to shut the door, but could not with Nate’s arm in the way. <br />
<br />
“Something wrong that you don’t want me in the shower with you?” Nate said almost hurt. <br />
<br />
Knowing that this might continue with everything else Brad would try, he quickly said, “You’re too busy flexing and admiring yourself at all times to ever care about anything.”<br />
<br />
Brad was immediately slammed into the shower door. Nate had begun to flex, and that included his fifth arm. Brad quickly I did the fifth arm from flexing and watched as the man in front of him flexed his other four arms in other ways. Nate barely noticed Brad and stared lustfully as he licked and kissed his own muscles. <br />
<br />
Brad finished up quickly and led Narcissus out of the dorm. They went to a college sprawling with just about every science imaginable. <br />
<br />
First, Brad visited the Chemistry Wing. There, the chemistry teacher sat by himself mixing chemicals. <br />
<br />
“Hello Mr. Komer,” Brad said wasting no time. “Congratulations on developing a serum that unclenches hands.”<br />
<br />
“Why thank you,” beamed the professor. “I have some right here.”<br />
<br />
“And you’re going to pour it here on Nate’s fifth arm,” Brad said. <br />
<br />
The professor obliged, as if a buff naked man with five arms fondling a classmates dick through their pants was normal. He poured the liquid over the arm, and it evaporated. <br />
<br />
“Looking good Nate,” the professor said winking. <br />
<br />
Brad left for the engineering wing, where they were testing lasers. With a few phrases, Brad placed the arm of Nate in front of the strongest laser and had them activate it. Nate’s arm just absorbed it and even clenched Brad tighter. <br />
<br />
None of this was enough for Brad. He could go to every wing and Nate would never let go. He needed a paradox. And unstoppable force for this immovable object. <br />
<br />
Brad asked back to Nate’s dorm. <br />
<br />
“Nate has an identical twin brother named Kyle who also rooms here,” Brad said.  A door materialized. Brad opened it up and found an identical five armed man inside. He was clothed, which made some sense. <br />
<br />
“Kyle, who has always been named, has never let anyone grasp my dick and will always remove anyone from doing it,” Brad said before Kyle could even open his mouth. <br />
<br />
Kyle lunged for Brad and forced down his pants. With all five of his hand he grasped at Nate’s hand, and there was a flash of blinding light. <br />
<br />
<br />
————————<br />
<br />
<br />
Brad awoke on the floor. His head was spinning. He looked at his dick, and there was nothing around it. He blinked, and suddenly there was a large hand grasped around it. He was within the grasp of Nate. <br />
<br />
Brad looked around. Nate was posing to himself as was usual. <br />
<br />
Brad blinked, and Nate was gone. Replaced with an identical character, probably Kyle, sitting at a table. <br />
<br />
But the chair he was sitting in was identical to himself, with one pair of hands on the ground and another straight forward imitating a chair. Kyle was sitting in a human chair. <br />
<br />
Brad blinked, and his dick was grasped again. Kyle disappeared, but the chair persisted. <br />
<br />
Brad had created a paradox. One that was messing with the world around him. The tv the Nate has once played games on suddenly transformed into a model of Nate that stood there posing. <br />
<br />
And Brad blinked once more</p>
