<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jeff wakes the next morning he realizes that he has transformed back to normal, a smile spreads across his face, “it’s good to be a male again,” he says to himself, “though being a Vixen sure was interesting”.<br />
<br />
As he looks over to where he had left his female clothes, the teen smiles when he notices that also his clothes are back to normal, “well, at least I was able to cheer Tyler up,” he says, getting out of bed and starting to get dressed, “I hope he’ll find the right female soon. I’m sure he will, he’s such a good guy”.<br />
<br />
Jeff checks himself in the mirror when he hears a knock on his door, ‘who could that be,’ he asks himself, “who is it?”<br />
<br />
“Morning Jeff,” he hears a familiar voice, “it’s me, Tyler. May I come in?”<br />
<br />
Jeff opens the door, “morning, Tyler,” he says, smiling, “what can I do for you, don’t tell me you want me to become “Jess” again?!”<br />
<br />
Tyler chuckles as he steps into the room, Jeff closing the door behind him, “haha, no don’t worry,” he says, “as much as I have enjoyed “Jess’s” company the night before, I didn’t come to ask “her” out again. I only came to thank you for cheering me up”.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “well, I couldn’t just let you suffer like that,” he says.<br />
<br />
“I wanted to give you something,” Tyler then says, he then pulls out a silver necklace with the head of a Fox and holds it out to Jeff, “I made this for you, I hope it didn’t turn out to feminine,” he chuckles.<br />
<br />
Jeff takes the necklace, “haha, no don’t worry,” he says, “thanks”.<br />
<br />
Tyler smiles, “I put a spell on it, whenever you are in danger, or need my assistance, just clench your fist around the medallion and say my name, and I’ll immediately be by your side to defend you!”<br />
<br />
“Wow, that’s amazing, thanks Tyler,” Jeff says, putting the necklace around his neck.<br />
<br />
“Also,” Tyler says, moving a hand into his leather bag, “I also wanted to give you this,” he then lets 100 gold coins fall into Jeff’s palm, “after all: you completed the task I gave you!”<br />
<br />
“Tyler, I’m honored, but, seeing how happy you were and still seem to be, is payment enough,” Jeff says, “you really don’t have to pay me”.<br />
<br />
“I insist, Jeff,” Tyler says, “please”.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, he then puts the money into his own leather bag, “thanks,” he then says.<br />
<br />
“So, what have you planned for today,” Tyler then asks.<br />
<br />
“I wanted to see if there are some more tasks I could do,” Jeff says, “maybe explore the forest”.<br />
<br />
“If you plan to go into the forest, you should get a bow and some arrows,” Tyler says, “if you want to, I can teach you how to hunt”.<br />
<br />
“That’ll be amazing,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Then I suggest we head to the blacksmith’s first to get you your bow and arrows,” Tyler says.<br />
<br />
It doesn’t take long for Jeff to purchase a bow and some arrows, then he and Tyler head into the forest, where they spend hours, Tyler teaching Jeff how to use the bow and arrows for hunting and to defend himself.<br />
<br />
“I should get myself a sword though too,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“I agree,” Tyler says, “bows are only useful for targets in the distance, your dagger is not really suitable to defend yourself with, a sword is better”.<br />
<br />
“I’d need to complete a few more tasks until I am able to purchase a good enough sword,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
After two more hours of training, Tyler turns to Jeff, “I’d need to take care of something,” he says, “will you be okay by yourself?”<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, “sure, besides,” he says, holding up his necklace, “I’ve got your “calling card” if anything bad should happen”.<br />
<br />
Tyler smiles, “I hope you won’t have to use it so soon,” he says, “I guess I’ll see you around, Jeff”.<br />
<br />
“I hope so,” Jeff says, “thanks again, Tyler,” he then adds.<br />
<br />
Tyler smiles, “no problem, Jeff,” he says, he then turns and walks away, leaving Jeff by himself on the clearing.<br />
<br />
After Tyler had left, Jeff decides to take a rest, he sits down in the soft grass, lying his bow and arrows next to him and leans against a tree.<br />
<br />
A few miles from Jeff, Theo is sitting in his room in a different town, the Fox stares out the window, tapping his claw against the window in boredom, “I’m so bored, there is nothing to do around here,” he says, he then smiles, “let’s see if Jess is by herself, I bet she is bored herself, longing for some… “fun”… hehe”. Theo concentrates on the link he has set up between himself and “Jess”, his smile grows into a grin, “I can sense her,” he says, “she’s in the forest near the town where she is staying, and she seems to be alone… perfect,” Theo mutters a spell and suddenly vanishes as he teleports himself to where “Jess” is.<br />
<br />
When Theo appear on the clearing, he is stunned to find the figure of a teenage human male, seeming to dozing under a tree, “what the… why… why is there a human boy,” the Fox mumbles to himself. Theo walks a little closer, his eyes narrowing, “can’t be, and jet, I can feel Jess… has she been cursed? Who and why,” Theo leans down and places a hand on Jeff’s shoulder, gently shaking it, “Jess,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff groans when he feels someone shake him, he opens his eyes, “T-Tyler,” he asks groggily, “I thought you had some business to attend to”.<br />
<br />
“It’s not Tyler,” Theo says, “it’s me, Theo. Jess… what happened… why… why are you a young human boy?”<br />
<br />
Jeff sits up a little, “oh, hey Theo,” he says, “I thought you were already on your way to your destination. How did you know where to find me, did Tyler tell you? And to answer YOUR question: this is who I really am, Tyler transformed me into a female Vixen. The reason for that was, I was curious and wanted to know what it would feel like being the opposite sex”.<br />
<br />
‘So it was Tyler who cursed her, eh,’ Theo asks himself, ‘that asshole, I bet he wanted to prevent me of finding her again, only for HIM to have her! Well… THAT is not going to happen, she is MINE!’<br />
<br />
“Theo,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
Theo blinks, “sorry, Jess,” he says, “I was kind of zoned out”.<br />
<br />
“My real name is “Jeff” by the way,” the teen says.<br />
<br />
Hearing this causes Theo to feel his anger increase, ‘that bastard, he even went as far as to make her believe she is a human male,’ he thinks to himself, “don’t you worry, Jess,” he then says, “I’ll free you of the curse my brother put on you. He thought he could keep you hidden from me, only to make you HIS female, HA! No, Jess… you are mine and I will save you from Tyler!”<br />
<br />
“Wh-what are you talking about, Theo,” Jeff asks, starting to get scared, “no one cursed me, Tyler hasn’t done anything to me!”<br />
<br />
“Jess, if you were truly a human boy, who got transformed into a Vixen, I would have sensed it when we met the night before, but I didn’t,” Theo says, “I can sense that you have been transformed against your will into a human teenager! Don’t worry Jess, I promise to fix everything,” his eyes then start to glow, “now, just relax, Jess and let me do the rest”.<br />
<br />
Jeff tries to look away, but he is unable to, he feels compelled to stare into Theo’s glowing eyes, “The-Theo… d-don’t… y-you are… making a hu-huge mis-mistake,” he says, already starting to be unable to think straight, “I… I am not… not Je-Jess… I… I’ve always… been a h-human boy… m-my name is Jeff! I… I let Ty-Tyler transform… me into a V-Vixen… just s-so I could ex-experience… what it… feels l-like being… a f-female and… and I wanted… wanted to ch-cheer Tyler up! Pl-please… y-you got… got to believe… me!”<br />
<br />
Theo lies a hand on Jeff’s cheek, caressing it, “shh… just relax, Jess,” he says in a calm voice, he then notices the necklace around Jeff’s neck, “who gave you that necklace? Tyler,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Y-yes,” Jeff says, still trying to fight against the hold Theo has on him, “he… he gave… it to me as… as a thanks f-for making his… n-night en-enjoyable… and… and for cheering him… up. It… it’s a pr-protection… he… he said wh-whenever I need his help… whenever… I’m in d-danger… all I need… to do… is to touch… the me-medallion and c-call out his name”.<br />
<br />
Theo lets out a growl, “no, Jess,” he says, “I think he gave it to you… to make sure no one will be able to break the curse he put on you. Hand me the necklace!”<br />
<br />
Jeff doesn’t notice as his hands reach up and take off the necklace, handing it to Theo, “I’m… not Je-Jess,” he says, “Theo… please!”<br />
<br />
‘The curse is stronger than I thought,’ Theo thinks to himself, taking the necklace which instantly crumbles to ash in his hand, ‘but I’ll break it’.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels his willpower become weaker, thinking becoming harder, his body relaxing, “The-Theo… st-stop… please,” he says weakly, “I… I’m not a f-female!”<br />
<br />
“Jess, Tyler made you believe that, but you’ve always been a Vixen,” the Fox says, “he may be able to fool you, since you have no magic of your own, but he can’t fool me,” Theo then uses his magic to show Jeff an illusion of the night before, “remember the past evening, remember when we met at the party,” he says, “tell me, what do you see?”<br />
<br />
“I… I see, T-Tyler,” Jeff says, “you… and me”.<br />
<br />
“And what are you,” Theo asks.<br />
<br />
“A… a Vixen,” Jeff says, “b-but that is… that is not wh-who I really am! Tyler… he transformed… me into h-her! Ju-just for the e-evening, s-so that… I could… experience being a f-female… and T-Tyler enjoy his… his evening after… after his female… broke up with him! I… I was never a f-female be-before that evening… I’ve always been… a human t-teenager.”<br />
<br />
“No, Jess,” Theo says, “that is a lie. Tyler transformed you into… this human, to hide you from me, because he wanted to make you his female, he gave you false memories, made you believe you were a human teenager!”<br />
<br />
“N-no… T-Tyler… he… he didn’t do s-such a thing,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Theo growls, ‘this is the strongest curse I have ever dealt with,’ he thinks to himself, ‘but I can sense that it’s getting weaker’. The Fox strokes Jeff’s cheek in a soothing way, “I want you to forget Tyler,” he says, “I promise to never let him near you again, Jess. I assume he made you attracted to females, but that isn’t right, you were attracted towards males”.<br />
<br />
“N-no… no… I wasn’t,” Jeff says, “I… I’ve always… been a straight m-male!”<br />
<br />
“Jess, I remember you checking me out,” Theo says, “I could tell that you find me attractive, Tyler seemed to have noticed, that is why he cursed you! He didn’t want you to fall in love with me, he wanted you to fall in love with HIM!”<br />
<br />
“Th-that’s not true,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Then tell me, Jess,” Theo says, “do you find me attractive?”<br />
<br />
“Y-you… you are extremely… handsome,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Theo smiles, “tell me, am I more handsome than Tyler?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Theo’s smile turns into a grin, “I thought so,” he says, “Jess, let me tell you a secret, from the second I saw you… I KNEW we were meant for each other. Listen to your heart, it knows that you and I should be together, Jess. Forget all about Tyler, stay away from him, forget the name he gave you! You are NOT a male human teenager named Jeff… you are and always have been a 16-year-old Vixen named Jess”.<br />
<br />
“I…,” Jeff starts.<br />
<br />
Theo senses that he almost “broke” the “curse”, “that’s right, you are Jess, always have been,” he whispers calmly, “remember, remember the feeling of butterflies in your stomach when we met! I know you were asking yourself how big I may be, you want to taste may cock… feel it inside you! You want me to fill you… impregnate you… you want to be a mother and MY wife! Now, tell me… who are you and what do you want?”<br />
<br />
Finally Jeff snaps, “I… I’m Jess… I’m a Vixen,” he says weakly, “I… I want… I want to be… your… female!”<br />
<br />
Theo smiles, ‘I broke the curse,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I knew I could do it, now she is mine,’ The Fox frees Jeff, now Jess, from the trance.<br />
<br />
Jess blinks a few times and looks around, seeming to be a little confused, when “her” eyes spot Theo smiling down at her, Jess smiles, “Theo… sorry, I kind of zoned out,” the still male says.<br />
<br />
Theo smiles, “that’s okay, my dear,” he says, “let’s get you out of here, far away from my evil brother!”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah… I can’t believe he did that to me,” “Jess” says, “all because he can’t get over the loss and can’t accept that I just wanted to be friends. Thanks for saving me!”<br />
<br />
Theo again smiles, holding out a hand, which “Jess” takes and lets herself be pulled to her feet, “no problem,” he says, “your body is still that of a human male, but I’m to exhausted to fix it… do you mind staying a male a little longer until I have recharged my energy?”<br />
<br />
“Of course, lover,” “Jess” says, “I don’t want you to overdo it! But, will you be able to manage a teleportation in your current state?”<br />
<br />
Theo nods, “that I still am able to do,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Then let’s get out of here,” the “Vixen” says, “I don’t want to be anywhere near where Tyler is,” Theo nods and after “Jess” has collected her bow and arrows, she takes Theo’s hand and with a crack they both vanish.</p>
