<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Phil walked slowly alone kicking at the pathway bricks. Even as he walked the screams of transforming people was heard. &quot;Oh God, more people who don't care to be careful.&quot;  Phil stopped and looked out to see the most cute blonde girl changing to a lioness. The girl pleaded for Phil to come to her aid. She screamed in terror as her two breasts became eight.
<br />

<br />
Phil called out to her, &quot;I can't or I'll join you as a lion!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The girl called back, &quot;Curse you to live in this animal Hell too! You fucking son of a bitch, I hope you get cursed......&quot;
<br />

<br />
In those final words her mouth changed as to nolonger allow human speech. She roared and growled, walking close to the scene edge she snarrelled at Phil.
<br />

<br />
Phil turned and began to run, then after a short ways remembered his boarish friend. &quot;Walk to the exit,&quot; was what he said. 
<br />

<br />
Phil met groups of people standing and looking at the African beastly scene. He pointed to the warning signs and reminded the people to stay on the pathway. Most listened, but some were toughy types and gave hime the California Howdy one finger wave.
<br />

<br />
Finally he saw the big steel doors of the African Scene Exibit's exit. Phil walked past two groups of people, wishing to leave the Hell hole.
<br />

<br />
Reaching for the door handle he saw another fool playing with his future. A sloppy clothed youth was inching past the pathway edge at the very corner of the scene. Looking back at his friends on the path he was moving very slowly toward a small herd of Zebra.
<br />

<br />
Inching his way between the barrier wall and the standing tall grass he was planning to pounce on one of the kindly beasts.
<br />

<br />
Phil looked at the group and pointed to the warning signs. Since no response came from the group to help their friend back to human life, Phil decided to try and scare the Zebra away.
<br />

<br />
Just as Phil took a deep breath the foolish boy leaped out of his hidding place and grabbed a Zebra colt. In a moment he picked up the colt the herd took off on a run.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey look what I got! Even as the words passed his lips he tripped and fell face first into a still warm pile of steaming Zebra stuff.
<br />

<br />
The pain shown over his face as the African curse spread into his body. Screaming in pain and fear the youth begged his companions to help him.
<br />

<br />
His short sleeves pushed tight as muscles expanded. Arms stretched out longer as they became fore legs. In a moment his black fingers merged into a solid forehoof. The pain must have been too much as he screamed for help, &quot;Pweeeese, Weelp Eeeee... his lips changed as the words tried to get out.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The pleading of their friend was too much to hear as three of the five lept over the grass barrier and ran to aid their friend. 
<br />

<br />
Phil yelled, &quot;Don't touch him or the change will be on you too!&quot;
<br />

<br />
A THUD to the back of Phil's head sent him to the bricks. As his vision cleared a youth looked down at him saying, &quot;Hey honkie we take care of our own!&quot;
<br />

<br />
In that second the screaming boy had his friend's screams merged with his as the African Exibit had six new colt Zebras to enjoy their life in the zoo.
<br />

<br />
The remaining youths looked at their transforming friends. The boys pleaded with their friends to help them, even as Phil said, &quot; Each of you will join them as a Zebra if you walk off the pathway.  I know, my girl is a water buffalo back there! I lost a new friend too, he is a swine boar over a herd of sows which were his wife and kids.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey man we can't go home and tell their people that they decided to live at the zoo! The larger of the youths continued to explain. &quot;Hey you saw your friends become b-e-a-s-t-s and what did you do for them?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Phil explained how he almost joined Lydia as a cow buffalo but before the change took him over he made it back on the bricks. He explained the boar he met when Jake and he fell into the swine scene.
<br />

<br />
As Phil got up and the youths stood next to him they all watched as five frisky colt Zebras strolled and grazed.
<br />

<br />
Hand in hand the three walked over to the exit door. One youth turned and yelled, &quot;Hey boys enjoy baby!&quot;
<br />

<br />
All but one Zebra continued to graze except one who raised his head. Looking toward his past friens he whinnied a good bye and lowered his head to graze.
<br />

<br />
The youths walked out into the sunlight together as Phil strolled behind.
<br />

<br />
&quot;THAT'S HIM,  THAT'S THAT CURSE BASTARD WHO PUSHED JAKE INTO THE SCENE! screamed Jake's girlfriend.
<br />

<br />
Suddenly looking up Phil saw the woman and her friends standing with three big men.  The men dressed in high leather boots, white bloomed pants, a tight red three button jacket and all with wips and top hats.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey we have you on our list, said one of the men.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yea, our list of future Jackasses, said another man.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The youths stood there and watched Phil get scared. He knew he had to run lest he join the zoo as some plain ass.
<br />

<br />
In a quick move Phil darted back into the African Exibit just as some crying girl walked out.  Slamming the door shut gave Phil some time to think. Luck for Phil the door had no handles on the sunny side.
<br />

<br />
Phil thought about running back to the swine scene and joining Jake and his friendly boar.  The after thought was seemingly better to be a jackass in a barn rather than a boar on the open African plains.
<br />

<br />
What to do, what to do, Phil remember the lion girls' curse and it seemed to fit the men outside. They would curse Phil to be a bastard as an ass. He thought about having humped sex with jennies and how he would feel as a working animal.
<br />

<br />
Choices, choises, Phil sat down braced against the steel doors.
<br />

<br />
The men banged on the doors as Jake's girlfriend egged them on with her hate.
<br />

<br />
The doors started to open as Phil laid down behind the tall grass in front of the barrier wall next to the steel doors. Head down he laid quiet as the doors finally opened and three tough men and one angry girl ran down the pathway looking for Phil.
<br />

<br />
The doors stood open as the two youths watched the scene to anger and hate unfold. Phil looked up, seeing the open doors and looking at the four people way down the path he darted for freedom.
<br />

<br />
The youths yelled in fright as Phil went past them and out of the exibit. The youths followed and the three ran off into the crowds of the Great Circe's Zoo.</p>
