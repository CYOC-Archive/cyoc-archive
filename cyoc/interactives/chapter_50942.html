<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So how many vials of the whites powder have you managed to make so far?&quot; Father Mike <br />
asked as long as Serenity was here. <br />
<br />
Serenity answered. &quot;About a dozen so far not counting the sample you gave me, I took a <br />
lot of my alchemy set when we packed up and re-located.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alchemy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried a lot of tricks to try and become a man again after I was cursed... it didn't work <br />
out. But I did learn a good job of alternate chemistry and knew better than to keep things <br />
like that laying around after we left the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you turn lead into gold?&quot; Mary asked after all the craziness she had been put <br />
through. <br />
<br />
Serenity said simply and to the point, &quot;No, that's BS.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Mary nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;How did the translating go?&quot; Father Mike asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother was a very big help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glade to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;White powder?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
Serenity said, &quot;It refers to how Father Mike and his brother destroyed the part of the game <br />
inside them. It can destroy turn of anyone who it's used on. I want to have some ready for <br />
when the victims are all restored, and afterwards it can act as a vaccine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why haven't you used it before-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Father Mike only used it and rediscovered it when he and his brother were cursed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why didn't you use as a 'vaccine' before?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Mike said, &quot;I was hoping that the game that transformed my brother and I was the <br />
only one.... I was dead wrong...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And sadly we -need- the game as the only means to restore those turned into part of <br />
Jensen's pack. So if we do it now, or.... if something happens to you Mary I'm sorry to <br />
say... Sorry Mary.&quot; Madam Serenity said apologetically. <br />
<br />
Mary sighed, &quot;Can we talk this over with my parents already?&quot; If this game had screwed <br />
over with her life, she wanted to know it sooner than later. &quot;I just want to be me again <br />
quick, it's throwing me off kilter me out having to look up at everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got off lucky.&quot; Trevor retorted, &quot;You at least still have thumbs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary started.<br />
<br />
Serenity said, &quot;Now Trevor be polite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Always 'Trevor be polite'...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;At any rate,&quot; Serenity said shifting the subject, &quot;Yes Mary, let's go see your family.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not an island or pirate ship in sight.&quot; Amber said as she scanned the horizon, &quot;I <br />
guess we really are in the middle of nowhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Garnet commented to her relatively taller companion, &quot;I just hope this island is big enough <br />
to hold our entire pack and our deer game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to be playing games with our food?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Amber it's... game as in hunting game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think our hunting will really be a game if we're forced to tough it out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amber, the third definition in the dictionary for game refers to wild animals you hunt for <br />
food.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, okay, I didn't know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I gathered.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And then I don't feel~ so bad~!&quot; Amethyst finnish her womanhood bouncing up and down <br />
as she skipped along. <br />
<br />
&quot;Amethyst, should you really be singing when we're supposed to be scouting?&quot; Lazuli <br />
asked almost mesmerized by the whole sight. <br />
<br />
&quot;But everything is so pretty! And it makes me feel so happy! How can I not sing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By closing your muzzle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Nah! Now let us go! There is so much more for us to behold!&quot; And Amethyst skipped <br />
along like she was made of air. <br />
<br />
Lazuli just stared after here and then began to follow, &quot;I wonder if her brains all went into <br />
her chest... or maybe they're full of air and have lifted her head into the clouds...&quot; <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish we had brought a pad and pencil.&quot; Cornelian said as they pushed their way past <br />
another giant leaf in the muzzle.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No use complaining about it now... just memorize it all as best we can.&quot; Topaz <br />
responded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I know... hopefully everyone is having better luck than us.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAHHHH!&quot; The two she wolves screamed as the giant crab chased them out o the cave <br />
it's pinchers snapping. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ruby... RUBY!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh? Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emerald asked one elbow in the palm of Emerald's hand, the other hand's fingers' claws <br />
touching the tip of Emerald's face. &quot;My word, you were day dreaming again weren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, maybe. It's just worried. We are rather in just the kind of place that turns out to have <br />
a slave trader's way station, a cursed temple, some mutant genetic super lobster, or some <br />
crash landed alien space ship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You left out hole in the space time continuum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We've already today been turned into sparkly colored naked wolf women. I'm  sure we've <br />
used up our weirdness quota for this life time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I hope so.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, with Amethyst singing about, the mood is all wrong for alien abduction and flesh <br />
hungry sea zombies anyway.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So when she stops singing I should start worrying?&quot; Ruby asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sistah, don't over think things.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we should bring lumber here? Or should we use the local trees?&quot; Carol <br />
asked looking at the tall forest. <br />
<br />
&quot;The deer are going to need something to eat, and we don't know how this weather is <br />
going to effect their life cycle.&quot; Her fellow pink wolf Touramline replied. &quot;It might be better <br />
to bring our own supplies through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But can Alice and her sisters even do that? I mean, bringing all that stuff through tralala?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We won't know until we asked. As it would save us a lot of effort of cutting down and <br />
cutting them all to size first.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So do you think we look good in pink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, just making sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So this is the Russian Winter.&quot; Samantha commented, &quot;It's not so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because I don't think the reflection feels as cold as the real thing.&quot; Martha said.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked at Alice. <br />
<br />
&quot;What? It does seem to never be unpleasantly warm or cold in our world opposed to the <br />
outside world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone looked at Alice weird and continued to look around at the dresses. <br />
<br />
&quot;All of them have shawls.&quot; Abbey observed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well this is Russia.&quot; Samantha said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at all the lines everywhere... it's like a painting.&quot; Abbey said sticking her nose into <br />
everything. <br />
<br />
The dresses from China were in Martha's arms. A gold and green flower pattern for Alice, <br />
a leaf pattern for Abbey, and a dress with the same color but inverted for Samantha. <br />
Needless to say with dresses this form fitting Martha was going to have to do alterations <br />
for them. 'I just hope my sowing kit exists in the reflection of the estate.' <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Randy and Zelda Niemand had their car full of souvenirs and their own things of course.  <br />
But they weren't about to unload out the entire thing without Zylphia's help, a third of the <br />
souvenirs were for here of course. They wished they had been able to bring her with them, <br />
but school came first, and Zylphia knew this better than anything. Pretty faces only got you <br />
a station as a trophy wife.  Which was had gotten Randy attracted to Zelda in the first <br />
place. She was the only girl Randy had met who tried to -talk- to him instead of just trying <br />
to swoon him with her body. <br />
<br />
They wished she had better friends than Jennifer, the rest weren't so bad, but she could do <br />
so much better. Then again, maybe it was Jennifer who secretly needed Zylphia. Jennifer <br />
had been her whole life just a pretty face, their Zylphia had LEARNED instead of swooning <br />
lonely men to do her work for her. <br />
<br />
They drove up the Smith's house hold. <br />
<br />
&quot;Always,&quot; Zelda commented, &quot;Always with more security and more more bling.&quot; When she <br />
saw the garish gargoyles and the new thick doors. <br />
<br />
Randy found the buzzer and rang it not getting out of the car.</p>
