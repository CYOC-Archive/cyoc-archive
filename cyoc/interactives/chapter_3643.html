<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The twenty-minute trip to school passed in a blur for Jennifer, but without incident. Every one of the people on the bus, even the new arrivals, completely ignored her sudden transformation. A couple of them made comments about her, but in a way that made it clear they were just repeating an old familiar routine. There was no apparent thought that she was unusual in any way,  just the occasional comment along the lines of the one from the kid about her tail. It seemed that everyone completely accepted her as being normal, even though she was one of a kind.
<br />

<br />
When the bus stopped, everyone got off. She was in the middle of the group exiting the vehicle. While a couple of people told her to move a little faster, and one stepped on her tail, again things were eerily normal. She hopped down the steps to the bus in one jump, almost landing on the girl in front of her who shrieked a little then said loudly, &quot;For god's sake, Jen, be careful.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The teenagers milling about in front of the school were talking noisily, before slowly and reluctantly filing in through the main doors. Jennifer joined them, once more no-one paying any special attention to her. A lot of people waved and greeted her, and she waved back as best she could with one foreleg. She was wondering what she was going to do when she got inside, without hands to open her locker or even hold a pencil. Occupied in her own thoughts, she didn't notice the three boys off to one side in a little group, talking amongst themselves and apparently waiting for someone. 
<br />

<br />
One of them, a tall dark-haired 18-year old, suddenly spotted her in the throng and nudged his cronies. &quot;Guys, there she is. Get ready.&quot; The three boys approached, two of them circling around to the other side. Jennifer was hopping slowly along the path to the doors trying not to bump into anyone else, which was difficult because her hops were much longer than normal steps. She paused to allow a group of kids in front of her to get through the door so she wouldn't land on them, then found the two boys standing in her way.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh. Hello, Tim, Ian&quot;, she said, looking from one to the other. &quot;Where's the third stooge? You guys are always together, causing someone a problem.&quot; She smiled a little nastily, momentarily forgetting her own problem. The three seniors were indeed almost always hanging around together, and were well know for playing often viscious pranks on the student body. Mainly on attractive girls. She had been the butt of several of their 'jokes', and loathed the whole group. Most people did.
<br />

<br />
While she was glaring at the smirking duo, wondering what they were up to this time, the third member of the little gang had been sneaking up from behind. The first she know of it was when she suddenly felt a hand grab the edge of her pouch, and looked down just in time to see it pulled open and the other hand push something deep inside, then pull out. Whirling around, her tail knocking both Tim and Ian flying, she confronted the grinning conspirator, who had jumped back out of range.
<br />

<br />
&quot;You bastard, Roberts, what did you do?&quot;, she yelled. Her forepaws were scrabbling at her pouch, but whatever he'd dropped in there was down at the bottom and out of her reach, not that she could have pulled it out anyway having no real way of gripping it. The feeling of even having a pouch was disconcerting, but having something IN it was really wierd. She craned her neck ad was able to see that the bottom of her pouch was bulging a little. Whatever was in there was about the size of a coconut. John Roberts looked pleased at her reaction, and winked. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Enjoy&quot;, he said with a grin. &quot;I know we will.&quot; His friends had got to their feet, and the three of them stepped back. She was distracted by a sudden vibration coming from in her pouch, and cut her retort short. The vibration grew, accompanied by a humming sound, and she squirmed. The inside of the furry pocket, it seemed, was very ticklish, and the thing in there was producing very uncomfortable sensations.
<br />

<br />
&quot;You BASTARDS!&quot;, she yelled, as the vibrations of the foreign object made the skin of her pouch ripple. &quot;Get it out, get it out.&quot; She frantically tried to reach into her pouch, but it was hopeless. Jumping around in involuntary motions of her new lower body, she was going red with discomfort from both the tickling vibrations and the frantic flopping of her huge breasts. The three seniors were rolling around in helpless laughter, and several passing students had stopped and were grinning at her, although everyone was staying well out of range of her flailing tail.
<br />

<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot;, a voice shouted from behind. A large hand caught her shoulder, unemcumbered by an arm though it was. &quot;Calm down and hold still, Jennifer&quot;, the voice continued. She tried to obey, and looked at the face belonging to the face and the hand. It was Rich.
<br />

<br />
'Oh god', she thought. As soon as she saw him, she had an almost overpowering sexual urge. He smiled at her, and held her shoulders until she calmed down and was only twitching slightly from the sensations of the thing in her pouch.
<br />

<br />
&quot;OK, hold still&quot;, he said, and reached into her pouch. &quot;Pardon me, but you seem to need some help.&quot; He fumbled around inside for a moment, then pulled out a spherical plastic device covered with large rubber protrusions. It was one of those peculiar battery-powered toys that jump around the floor when turned on. Turning it off, he flung it at the three tormentors who were looking disappointed that their fun was over. &quot;Act your age&quot;, he snarled at them. John mock-saluted him, picked up the toy, and turned on his heel and marched into the school followed by his still-giggling flunkies.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Are you all right?&quot;, Rich asked solicitiously, looking carefully at her face and not allowing his eyes to wander lower. She stared at him, her face still red although now it was from barely-supressed desire. She was horrified since she had never really wanted him before. He was attractive enough, and his parents were very wealthy, but he just wasn't her type. Now however, the dare was making her helplessly attracted to him and she wasn't sure how long she could hold back. She felt very aroused, and looking down was mortified to see that her nipples had gone rigid and were sticking out nearly three inches.
<br />

<br />
Leaning forward she wrapped her forelegs around his waist as best she could, then leaned forwards pressing her enormous breasts into his body and gave him a quick but suggestive kiss. &quot;My hero&quot;, she purred, inwardly thinking 'No, I don't want this.' Unfortunately, she was unable to stop herself. &quot;You deserve a... special... reward for helping me like that. How about coming home with me after school?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Rich looked a little taken aback. Jennifer was very attractive, but had never shown any real interest in him before. Thanks to the curse he didn't think anything odd about having a half-kangaroo girl come on to him, and felt himself responding to the sensation of having a pair of amazingly large and rigid nipples rubbing against his lower chest. &quot;Uh, I guess&quot;, he said slowly. He didn't have a current girlfriend, his previous love interest having moved away a couple of weeks before.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Great&quot;, she smiled. &quot;Meet me outside after school.&quot; She straightened up, flipped her long hair off her face with a quick shake of her head, then hopped through the door that he quickly held open for her. As soon as she was out of earshot her bright smile collapsed as the lust faded a bit. 'Oh Fuck', she moaned inwardly. 'Kyle's going to get everything he wanted.' Stopping by her locker, she suddenly heard an unpleasantly familiar voice, and turned her head to stare at Kyle who had been waiting for her.</p>
