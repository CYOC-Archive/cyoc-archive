<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At this stage Amber&#39;s kid sister Indigo had heard enough of this<br />
out stepped out of the ranks of politely not-trying-to-listen <br />
dragonkin and marched up to the three of you<br />
<br />
      &quot;Amber,stop pulling the human jumpers tail.You know perfectly well<br />
that she came from Earth and that she started as a male human!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Amber and Pitch exclaimed<br />
<br />
       &quot;Indigo,Get Lost!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
but Indigo pointed at her sisters outfit and said<br />
<br />
&quot;human jumper,don&#39;t you see my suster is wearing a lab coat?Don&#39;t you see the slide rule she has in her right pocket?&quot;<br />
<br />
You did.And did.<br />
<br />
You looked at Pitch and Amber with a bit more suspision this time<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats up!&quot; you said<br />
<br />
Amber glowered at her snickering bratty sister Indigo,<br />
rolled<br />
her slitted eyes and said <br />
<br />
      &quot;follow me&quot;<br />
<br />
So you,Pitch,Indigo and quite a few of the other (clothed dragon-kin <br />
followed a furiously marching Amber down the path.<br />
<br />
Amber turned around,blushed as she realized you were going about in nothing more then a hospital gown and waved to someone in the crowd to get you some<br />
decent dragoness-kin clothing.<br />
<br />
Several dragoness-kin charged back into their caves and came back with various<br />
<br />
sets of jewelry,corsets,brassieres and overcoats and gowns and dresses.<br />
<br />
So after about 15 minutes of getting you properly clothed ,soon<br />
the procession was on its way tagging behind Amber,whose tail<br />
was swinging back and forth obviously in a rotten mood.<br />
<br />
Pitch sidled up beside you,as did Indigo,and the two gave you a crash course<br />
on advanced teleportation physics 101.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ambers a 4rth year university student specializing in jump science &quot; said Pitch<br />
<br />
&quot;After the enemy forces abducted all our jump scientists,including<br />
Dr Theresa Klinckelmeyers,Amber was the only dragoness-kin ( and<br />
drake-kin for that matter) who knew how to get our smashed <br />
Jump-Slip repaired and going again&quot; said Indigo<br />
<br />
&quot;However she&#39;d made a mistake while putting the machines back together and broke the Prime Directive&quot; said Pitch<br />
<br />
&quot;Prime Directive?&quot; said you<br />
<br />
&quot; Contact with a less technologically and morally advanced<br />
  civilization&quot; said both Indigo and Pitch simultaneously<br />
<br />
It seemed that the rebuilt Jump that smart and brilliant Amber had<br />
got going again had not made contact with Earth Prime,<br />
which this colony depended on,but some backwards Earth # 76,665<br />
where dragons and dragon-kin  hadn&#39;t even ever existed.<br />
<br />
Your Earth.<br />
<br />
Naturally the colony had been hoping for supplies of food for the starving colonists,ammunition for their bolt guns and<br />
a functioning spaceship would have helped.<br />
<br />
As Amber swept down a curve in the path,she pushed aside<br />
some brushes and soon you and the others were going down a paved path<br />
pockmarked with little craters and ash spots here and there<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom and dad both were killed in the attack&quot; sniffled Indigo<br />
and Pitch moved to your other side to comfort his still grieving sister<br />
<br />
&quot;Amber&#39;s actually Indigo and mine half sister&quot; said Pitch as<br />
Amber up ahead picked her way around fallen masonry from <br />
collapsed buildings<br />
<br />
&quot;This reminds me of the Tadross University campus&quot; you remarked as <br />
your first memory of your Earth life was sparked awake<br />
<br />
&quot;Ambers dad was the dragon jump researcher Fafnir Klinckelmeyers<br />
and her mother was  Theresa Klinckelmeyers  dragoness-kin sister&quot;<br />
said Indigo,sniffeling as she stared at some heaped up mounds  of rubble<br />
<br />
&quot;After daddy died in the loss of the LuSirius IV <br />
the rebels cut off mommy&#39;s allowance.She came to the colony<br />
 when I was still a baby &quot;<br />
<br />
Pitch  steered his sister away from two mounds of rubble,a small one and a large one,and continued<br />
<br />
  &quot;Mom had lost a husband,stepdad had lost his wife so the two got<br />
married so Indigo and I could get some support from the <br />
dragons&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Ambers a half dragoness as well as your half sister&quot; you said<br />
and the dragon-kin brother and sister nodded in<br />
agreement.<br />
<br />
     It seemed that Fafnir Klinckelmeyers had got his daughter Amber a <br />
scholarship to study at Earth Primes prestigous (known across)<br />
the galaxy) Harvard University after he&#39;d noticed his daughters natural<br />
talent for fixing up the various components of the colony&#39;s only<br />
Jump-Slip Machine.<br />
<br />
Amber had been there for eight years at Harvard studying hard,unable<br />
to visit her dad and stepmom for those eight years.<br />
<br />
&quot;She only came back a half year ago ,just in time to watch<br />
the Dalai Vader stormtroopers swoop in,killed both our parents and <br />
blow her only means of escape,the Jump-Slip ,to<br />
a charred wreck&quot; said Pitch<br />
<br />
&quot;Then when I got it going again ,what I got was your planet&quot; growled<br />
a obviously ticked off Amber<br />
<br />
 &quot;And I got you&quot; she hissed as she stood by the open leadway,<br />
turned around and staring at you with her angry half dragoness eyes.<br />
<br />
And behind her towered the nine storey tall Jump-Slip<br />
Machine,a deep dark tunnel with various coils,rods and glowing red plates fastened to its outer tube.<br />
<br />
There were six other tubes of ever decreasing diameters mounted<br />
on its insides with gimbal bearings.<br />
<br />
The huge hulking thing lay still.<br />
<br />
A second memory from your past human life rose to the surface of your<br />
mind,the Echelon Tunnel.<br />
<br />
That failed Tadross  physics  experiment that Tadross<br />
researchers had hoped would scrub out the ozone from<br />
Earths atmosphere.Tadross U&#39;s gift in the war against climate change.<br />
<br />
You,Frank Dillinger,Security Guard 1rst Class,had been hired to guard the Echelon Tunnel from rescue by the protesters till it could be dismantled and scrapped in a few weeks.<br />
<br />
You started to open your snout to ask Amber a question<br />
but she had already stormed inside the ruined building <br />
that housed the Jump-Slip<br />
<br />
&quot;She hates your guts&quot; stated Indigo to the obvious body<br />
language statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;After Amber crossed over to your Earth,she was horrified to discover <br />
the Jump-Slip she found on your planet wasn&#39;t actually a Jump-Slip<br />
Machine&quot; said Pitch,who continued<br />
as he ushered his sister and you through the leadway<br />
<br />
&quot;  It takes two Jump-Slips  to cross back and forth,and what<br />
you Earthers call a Echelon Tunnel was drawing all its power and <br />
conversions from our side&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Amber was rebuilding our machine  and computers when I<br />
came barging in with my gun drawn&quot; you said as a image of a <br />
darkened room with a scaly intruder at the computer console<br />
flashed into your awakening mind<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s half dragon&quot;said Indigo<br />
<br />
&quot;When she sunk her fangs into you gun arm her<br />
saliva began dissolving you from the inside out as &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her dragon black bloodcells inside you turned you into the raw stuff <br />
they needed to make a clone of Amber&quot; finished Pitch<br />
<br />
Amber had a problem.She&#39;d already done a wonderful job of  <br />
breaking the Prime Directive and there she was giving<br />
Earthers a rudimentary Jump-Slip machine<br />
and here was this disintegrating human falling apart as a new clone of Amber was fairly bursting out of the human skin it was<br />
encased in<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Ambers twin sister?&quot; you said incredulously<br />
<br />
&quot; Yes&quot; said Pitch and Indigo together <br />
<br />
         and<br />
<br />
     &quot;NOOO!&quot; said Amber,who was dashing about on a platform flipping over various levers<br />
<br />
The Jump-Slip began to creak as the inner tunnels swayed on their gimbals<br />
<br />
She&#39;d scooped up what was left of your human bits and pieces  into<br />
a bucket and hauled you,her unwanted clone,with her<br />
back through the newly created Earth Jump-Slip back to the colony<br />
<br />
You felt a bit of a letdown as you realized<br />
you weren&#39;t the Chosen One,so-to-speak,but the <br />
result of some dragoness saliva going rogue once it had<br />
left Ambers mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you out of my horns&quot; snapped Amber as she pointed you towards the<br />
conveyor-escalator that had suddenly started moving.<br />
<br />
You just stood there,confused<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you get it human,I&#39;m sending you back to your Earth!&quot; the brilliant 4rth year Jump-Slip Science student said as she began<br />
frantically glancing at various televisors mounted in the control module<br />
<br />
&quot;They haven&#39;t destroyed the Echelon Tunnel yet.Our machine and <br />
that excuse for a oversized garbage compactor have re-established<br />
contact&quot; she choked out as the blurry image on the televisor cleared up to show<br />
a darkened room at Tadross University.</p>
