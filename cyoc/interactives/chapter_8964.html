<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Singleton watched the off and then on actions of his powerful Medallion. His curse on the gang had worked so neatly that as each one met his final fate the power surged and then cooled. Now for quite some time the Medallion lay cold and dark.<br />
<br />
Little care did Singleton experience for the lives he changed or the boys made lost. A short grumbling he bade himself about society knowing little lose because they were criminals through and through. A simple schrug as he cast them off and returned to his own life and the inconsiderate feeling he had for all.<br />
<br />
As the daytime passed he sat on his front porch. Watching the street he saw many things happening about. Neighbors argued, children played games, old folks kept to themselves, a lonely Cop walks his beat. The street was devoid of the F and J gang and few if any even took notice.<br />
<br />
The warm afternoon sunshine helped him slip into a well needed nap. No doubt his dreams were of what happened to his last victims or maybe his next. Then came the sock'o and he awoke in pain and feeling the trickle of his own blood.<br />
<br />
Laying on his lap was one red and bloody baseball. As his eyes panned upward and he sniffed up the blood dripping out his nose the street people all stood astare. A young eight year old had come up the porch steps to beg for the return of his ball. If alone only God would have known what Singleton could do to this boy. Yet far too many were there to witness and even as he reached into his pocket for the Medallion he just took out his handkerchief instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take the ball Sonny and you with your friends can come later to offer some apology!&quot; suggested Singleton.<br />
<br />
Reaching slowly the boy picked up the ball as singleton gave his sweaty hair a friendly shuffle. The act of friendship eased all on the street and even Singleton was surprised how all went back to as before.<br />
<br />
The coolness in late Summer soon sent Singleton inside to sit near a warm fireplace and enjoy a small Tv dinner. A quick look to the clock as he heard the door bell ring had him grabbing for the Medallion ready to wish the worst.<br />
<br />
Walking to the large steel covered wooden door he stood to one side and unlatched it. Ready he was for that wretchid child to offer his best apology only to have him sent into beastdom forever.<br />
<br />
Slowly the door opened and as quickly Singleton reached around the door saying, &quot;I curse you child to be as some rank and wretchid beast to live and work the city streets!&quot; The Medallion's power roared to life as his hand touched the finger holding the door's outside knob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my Lord in heaven! screamed a young and tender voice.<br />
<br />
Singleton peered around the thick door and stood mouth open and not a word could he say. There with suitcase on the porch stood his Niece Nancy Farnsworth. Her eyes wild in fear she stood rigid and like a statue from the park. <br />
<br />
The Cabbie was behind her and he too stood like he was made of stone. A look down saw her left hand with the tip for her Cab driver being taken at the moment he'd cast his curse. Singleton looked out past them both and into the dankly lit street wondering what creature would be there that now was to form Nancy's heritage.<br />
<br />
A banging of garbage cans could only suggest the scrap iron man and his cart pulled by one elderly gray Mule.<br />
<br />
Nancy shuddered and he looked at her fear filled face still not a word could she utter. The appearance of two growing and long black ears were sprouting out of her pretty hair. He peered past Nancy only to see the colored Cabbie with a Mule's muzzel and a head in rapid change to total Mule as well.<br />
<br />
Quickly Singleton pushed the Cabbie out into the dark as he jerked Nancy inside. &quot;Medallion, Medallion not her please not her!&quot; begged Singleton but to no availe as the bright Silver bobble could work it's magic only in one direction.<br />
<br />
Now he stood watching his own flesh and blood going through the terror of his curse. Sudden was his realization of those boys who went through such and made him wonder where they were even now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle, Uncle!&quot; were her last twwo words as face and lips rearranged in one smooth motion. The face of a very young Mule was now hers to have and know for all her life long. Reaching out her arms to beg for help he could only stand back as they strained out to form legs.<br />
<br />
Ripping and tearing her clothes fell apart and then to the wooden floor. The beauty to which he could only imagine now stood naked before him but in a rapid change to Mule.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nancy I'm sorry!&quot; offered singleton as her pretty pink skin darkened to black Mule's hide. He almost reach to touch her hand but then saw it melt and mold into a black and solid hoof. She shuddered and shook her larger and changing head.<br />
<br />
A leg rose up and then stretched reaching backward as skin colored black and hairs sprouted like new sown grass. The other leg followed as her new hind leg touched the floor hoof and all. a tear rolled down his face seeing the terror of her mind realizing the change now dim and memories flee.<br />
<br />
A Mule, one fine jenny Mule she would become and a worthy profit for Singeton to continue his life of ease. As she stood swishing her tail the learning of coarse brays to beg for food, water, and pleasures was her only response.</p>
