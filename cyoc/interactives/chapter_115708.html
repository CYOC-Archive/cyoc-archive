<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Beth had been rather skeptical about being set up with Eliza at first. After all, she was so old. She knew that a second dose of the Animalian virus would make Eliza younger and herself older, but she still seemed too old for Beth. The fact that Eliza was also a cat while Beth was a dog, a Doberman to be precise, wasn&#39;t that much of a bother. As Sarah had pointed out, the Edict about cross-species breeding only applied to actual breeding. And neither Beth or Eliza were likely to knock each other up.<br />
<br />
It turned out that Eliza made a rather wise decision in getting to know Beth better before they went any further. The fact that they were both Animalians who were mateless because of their sexual orientation was enough common ground to start off on. Eliza was a bit old-fashioned and Beth was more of a tomboy than most girls, but eventually, more common ground was reached. Beth&#39;s love of baking and Eliza&#39;s secret admiration for professional wrestling were something they could both agree on. To most people, it would seem like Beth was just regularly visiting an old lady and giving her company. A perfectly nice thing, though out of character for those who knew Beth has an edgy bully.<br />
<br />
Eliza had plenty of stories to tell about her life, which was a somewhat lonely one that ended with her being a spinster. Beth had to admit that some things about the past were pretty fascinating. In turn, Beth was able to open up about the feelings she hid from the world, how her insecurities made put on a tough image to keep people from mocking her. It was painful, but Eliza was a great comfort to her when she broke down. It helped build up the relationship between the two.<br />
<br />
Beth even got to meet Misty, the cat had been Eliza&#39;s pet and only company before the outbreak. She was a pretty cute cat with grey and white fur along with a curvy figure. She had moved out after the outbreak and now had her own apartment, a hunky tomcat for a boyfriend, and a successful job working at the local library. She had moved out ostensibly because she wanted to be able to support herself, but she admitted to Beth it was because of the discomfort of being around Eliza.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know she likes women and I don&#39;t hold that against her,&quot; Misty said to Beth, &quot;The plain fact is that I&#39;m only attracted to males and it wouldn&#39;t be fair to her to see me with tomcats regularly when she wanted to be with me. That&#39;s why I hope you&#39;ll be able to make her happy in the way that I can&#39;t.&quot; Her voice then took a more serious tone, &quot;But if you do anything to hurt her...&quot; She unsheathed the claws on her hands for emphasis.<br />
<br />
But Misty didn&#39;t have any reason to fear. Beth was increasingly becoming attracted to Eliza&#39;s spirit and she could tell Eliza was feeling the same way about her. The only real barrier was they were in completely different age groups. Well, no, that wasn&#39;t the real problem. The real problem is that the current US government was being lead by people who were openly anti-LGBT and there was a lot of heat against people who weren&#39;t straight. While Animalia was an open-minded community, the rest of the country would be less forgiving of a relationship that would cross so many lines. That was why Beth and Eliza had their anonymous interview published, so they could see how others would react. Unsurprisingly, there were people who decried their love as being &#39;sick and wrong&#39;. But more importantly, there were more people who supported them, some even lashing out against the hateful comments and calling on them for their hypocrisy.<br />
<br />
But what mattered more to Beth and Eliza was that there were more people telling them to be happy. If a few people wanted to be unreasonable and hate without really knowing them, let them. It was time for them to take their relationship to the next level. Beth had already talked to her father about her sexuality, her relationship with Eliza, and her wish to double-dose. Mr. Jonson took a while to accumulate to this information, but he gave his permission in the end. Eliza had already filed her paperwork for a second dose and Beth was also set. The only thing left was the actual dosage.<br />
<br />
Beth and Eliza had decided to use this opportunity to fill out a fantasy they both shared: attractive women growing out of their clothing. Beth was wearing some gym clothes that were pretty thin and would soon be too small for her. Beth was wearing an older dress that was terribly out of fashion and she wouldn&#39;t mind seeing being ripped up. They were both in Eliza&#39;s bedroom, which had plenty of standing room for the both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are completely certain about this, right?&quot; asked Eliza, &quot;I would hate for you to throw away your childhood because of an old woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a child,&quot; said Beth, &quot;And I&#39;d hardly be throwing anything away. There are a lot of double-dosed Animalians in school and they&#39;re still treated like everyone else. And I&#39;ll probably have a longer lifespan than a human so I don&#39;t have to worry about losing years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you&#39;re certain, I think it&#39;s time,&quot; said Eliza. There were plenty of ways for an Animalian to get a second dose of the virus. Direct exposure to the virus from tainted water or the body fluids of an Animalian of a different age group were enough to trigger the change. The two of them could have gotten shots or drank some milk from the uplifted cows. But they had decided their second exposure would be from something more simple and with less interference from others: a kiss long enough for saliva to pass from mouth to mouth.<br />
<br />
As soon as they felt the tingle, Beth and Eliza separated from each other. A feeling of warmth soon spread through their bodies. Beth soon felt a tightness as her clothes were getting too small. She flexed as she felt the muscles starting to build up in her growing arms and legs. She was feeling her torso start to fill out with curves and muscles too.<br />
<br />
For Eliza, it felt like a fire was being rekindled in her. Energy her body had not known in years was flooding through her veins. Her thinner arms were started to bulk up as fatigue left them. New strength was filling her legs even if she couldn&#39;t see them under the dress. But Eliza reveled in this change. It actually felt like she was getting bigger. It took her a while to notice she was getting bigger. While her health was improved by the first exposure to the virus, she still didn&#39;t improve as much physically as younger women. But the second dose wasn&#39;t just restoring her youth, it was giving her a body she could only have dreamed of before.<br />
<br />
Beth was moaning with pleasure, her voice becoming more of an alto. While she hadn&#39;t been flat-chested before, she hadn&#39;t been particularly pronounced. But now it seems the accelerated puberty was making up for it. Her breasts were becoming larger and rounder, stretching her shirt as tight as it would go. But that wasn&#39;t the only thing that was making it rip apart. Beth was a very athletic girl and had big muscles for her age. And her muscles were increasing a lot with her age now, building up into a real amazonian figure. Her gym shorts were also fraying as her hips and leg muscles grew, her butt not growing as large but still pretty shapely.<br />
<br />
Eliza was grunting as her dress was becoming tighter than she expected. Her muscles were building up to a level that she didn&#39;t expect. And her curves were becoming more pronounced than she ever had as a younger woman. The dress was already popping at the seams, but it wasn&#39;t fast enough for Eliza. Thankfully, she had claws that were just right for tearing open the older fabric. She gave sighs of relief as more of her enhanced body was exposed. Beth was also yanking at her tighter clothes as they became too much for her to bear. It didn&#39;t take long for both of them to reduce their clothes to tatters.<br />
<br />
Eliza had a large mirror in her room that she used for getting into dresses. Now both she and Beth could look into it and see what they&#39;ve become. The second dose of Animalian virus worked better than expected. The two of them were anthro amazons with fantastic figures. Beth grinned widely as she flexed her larger muscles. She was strong before, but now she was really ripped. She was built like a bodybuilder now, but she still had big healthy breasts and an ass that was just plush enough. Eliza was also a lot more muscular than she had expected. She flexed her arms, marveling at their thick size and toned muscles. Compared to Beth, Eliza was shorter and her muscles were slightly smaller, but she had more curves, definitely enough to make any woman jealous.<br />
<br />
Eliza combed her long hair, which was still grey like the rest of her fur. &quot;I was hoping it would turn black again,&quot; she said, her voice no longer old and creaky but young and melodious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it suits you,&quot; said Beth, her voice a deeper alto. She didn&#39;t keep her hair very long and it was still at a boyish cut, which suited her fine.<br />
<br />
Eliza looked the large Doberman woman up and down and said, &quot;You look very good for a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beth stroked Eliza&#39;s neck and said, &quot;And you look sexy for a cat, Eliza.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, call me Lizzie,&quot; said the cat lady as she leaned in closer.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for Beth and Lizzie to start making out again. Their attraction to each other only grew now that they were both young women. Whatever differences there were between them became completely unimportant. A strong love was growing between them, along with a powerful sexual need.<br />
<br />
Beth soon broke off and said huskily, &quot;Lizzie, I&#39;m so horny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lizzie nodded and said, &quot;Get on the bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ah, I think it&#39;s you who should get on first,&quot; said Beth before picking up Lizzie. Lizzie did a delighted squeak as she was carried over. She didn&#39;t know her new lover would be this strong. Beth dropped Lizzie on top of the bed before climbing up. Lizzie was expected them to keep making out and was surprised to see Beth facing the opposite direction from her. She didn&#39;t know what was going on until Beth had straddled her and spread open her legs. A slick tongue slid against her nethers, making Lizzie gasp. So that was what Beth wanted to start with. She could see Beth&#39;s tight cunt hovering above her head. Lizzie grinned mischievously before putting her hands on Beth&#39;s ass and pulling her down far enough so that Lizzie could run her rough tongue over Beth&#39;s cunt. Beth only gave a soft gasp before licking more enthusiastically.<br />
<br />
This was just the start for the two of them. They spent at least two hours exploring each other&#39;s bodies in as many ways as they could imagine. And this was probably only scratching the surface of what they could potentially do for each other. But eventually, after several orgasms, they laid down to rest. It didn&#39;t matter to them that they had been young and old, black and white, tomboy and lady, or even that they were dog and cat. They both knew that they were truly mates now, no matter what the world may say. They shared one last kiss before they snuggled together. They soon fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms, happy and content that they&#39;ve found another so alike in spirit.</p>
