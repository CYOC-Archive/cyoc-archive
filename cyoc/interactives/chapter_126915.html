<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Skyla twirled the plastic gun around her finger as she sauntered over to her desk, a wide grin on her muzzle. While she might not have expected her boss to remain as stoic as ever, even after being turned into a kitten, she was still feeling giddy about fulfilling multiple personal fantasies at once.  <br />
<br />
Giddy, and perhaps a little trigger happy.<br />
<br />
This had been her first chance to use the gun at all since Master had acquired it.   And while she had enjoyed watching Curt and Anna’s transformative exploits from the sidelines, now that her turn had come, she wasn’t going to let it go to waste.  She looked over her co-workers, all hunched over their desks.  Mundane people in mundane jobs.  Admittedly, thanks to her efforts, their employer was a little less mundane, but that was beside the point.  She had a chance to free them from the tyranny of the ordinary, and she was ready to take it!<br />
<br />
She set the options to “Maid Uniform” and “Busty” and took aim at the first guy in her sight.<br />
<br />
“Wait!”  Anna raised her voice slightly.  Skyla lowered the gun.   The rest of the office didn’t lift their heads from their work.  “Are you sure you should just be changing anyone?”  Anna continued, a little quieter, trying to make sure Cassidy and the toddlers wouldn’t hear.<br />
<br />
“I’m surprised to hear you asking that question.  You were having lots of fun zapping people earlier.  Afraid I’ll end up making more maids than you?”  She teased.<br />
<br />
“It’s not that, it’s just…”  Anna looked down at her feet.  She didn’t want to think about her latest change more than she had to, but she didn’t want Skyla to make the same mistake.  “But what if you change a guy who’s dating, and turning him into a girl ends up messing that love up?”<br />
<br />
Skyla opened her mouth to answer, then stopped as she thought about it.  Sure, her change had ended up potentially opening up a relationship she hadn’t had a chance at before, but she hadn’t really thought about how it might end up doing the opposite for some, even if they wouldn’t know what they’d lost.  “Why couldn’t that upgrade let you make whoever got changed bi?”  she mumbled under her breath.  “Well, you’ve got a point,” she continued, more audibly, “As much as I would love to make this whole office a haven for furry maids, I’d hate to accidentally split any couples.  And Master would probably feel responsible and guilt himself out of ever zapping people again, and we couldn’t have that, now could we?”<br />
<br />
“I guess not,”  Anna said, looking a little distracted.<br />
<br />
“You guess?  Don’t tell me you’re starting to feel guilty too.”<br />
<br />
Despite still feeling down about what she’d done to Susan, Anna shook her head.<br />
<br />
“That’s good.  I don’t know what got you down, but think about it this way.  Would you like to go back to how you were before, if you could?”  She put an arm around Anna.<br />
<br />
“No.”  Anna shook her head.  “I love being a cat, and my head’s felt clearer since I was changed.”<br />
<br />
“And I wouldn’t want to go back either.  And that pheonix girl over there…”<br />
<br />
“Kasai.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Kasai would’ve died without your help.  And so would&#39;ve Eva. And that guy at the McDonalds never tried to rob the place. So we’re definitely doing good, even if you feel like you messed something up.”  She gave a fanged grin.  “Plus it’s just plain fun!”   <br />
<br />
Anna nodded.<br />
<br />
“Anyway, I know a few guys in the office who’ll make fine targets, and a couple people that would probably be happier working for Master than slaving away over paperwork all day.”  She let go of Anna and walked through the maze of desks, the feline women following her.<br />
<br />
Three desks in the corner of the room were occupied be a trio of men, none of whom could be described as having the ideal male body, to put it kindly.  <br />
<br />
“Hey Steven, Louis, Gabe. How’ve you guys been doing today?”<br />
<br />
“Not great.  The boss has been breathing down our necks lately about the fiscal reports.  How about you?”  Steven said.<br />
<br />
“I actually just quit.  I’m working for Master Evenson full time now.  With my pension right from the get go.”<br />
<br />
“You lucky duck, you,” Gabe said.  “I’d give anything to be able to just be able to up and quit this place.  Too bad I don’t have connections like your boss.”  <br />
<br />
Skyla grinned widely, her fingers twitching around the grip of the gun as she thought of a fun animal to turn the guys into.  “You don’t say…”<br />
<br />
“What’s so funny?”  Louis asked. <br />
<br />
“Oh, nothing, just that I might happen to have a new job lined up for you three, too.”<br />
<br />
“Stop kidding aro-” Louis’s request was interrupted by a streak of green lightning hitting him.  His brown hair grew longer, and black fur began to sprout all over his skin.  His facial features softened, and his large nose shrank, though it was a little hard to tell as his new muzzle pushed forward slightly, pulling his nose along with it.  His ears grew much longer, rising upward and moving toward the top of his head, becoming a distinct pair of rabbit ears.<br />
<br />
His neck became thinner, and his shoulders less broad.  As the fur spread down his arms, they slimmed down, taking a more feminine appearance.  His fingers grew slightly longer and thinner, little pink pads forming on his palms and fingertips.  His shirt and pants joined together as they turned into a navy blue dress with a white apron, a lace headband forming atop his head in front of his ears.<br />
<br />
As his clothes changes, the overweight man’s excess mass began to shift, some of it moving to his chest, pressing the front of “his” dress forward quite a bit as two massive mounds took shape.  Meanwhile, underneath the dress his sex altered.  Other portions of his previous body fat moved into her widening hips, specifically in the rear, while the rest seemed to shrink away, giving her a generous hourglass figure.  A hole appeared in the back of her dress, letting a short, puffy tail stick out behind her.  As black fur spread down her legs they grew longer, and more shapely.  Her shoes and socks vanished as feet stretched out longer and her toes curled down, giving her feet a paw-like look, as soft, leathery pads formed on her feet.<br />
<br />
Lastly, a crescent of fur around her left eye turned white.  “I’m so glad you were able to work out a deal with our boss to let me have more time to serve Master!”  The rabbit woman cheered, her sunny disposition giving no hint that she was aware of the changes.  She turned to her two male co-workers.  “You hear that guys?  I get more time off to work for Master!”<br />
<br />
Skyla noticed a little hologram pop-up from the gun, stating that 15 anthro maids had been created in total, while also reminding her that the next upgrade would occur at twenty.<br />
<br />
“Well, congratulations, Luna.”  Steven said.  “Glad Skyla was able to pull some strings for you, too.”  He turned to the vulpine head maid.  “So, what was that you said about having new jobs lined u-”  Another streak of green lightning flew from the tip of the gun, hitting the man in his chest, which promptly began to grow an impressive bust, while “his” hips widened, and his sex changed.  <br />
<br />
Like Louis/Luna before her, Steven’s ears grew into the long ears of a rabbit, while her feet became paws, her hands gained pads, a short, fluffy tail appeared above her rear, and her face stretched out into a short snout.  Unlike Luna, however, her body stayed chubby, and her fur became a pure white color, her black hair turned blonde and curly, with her clothes turning into a more traditional black and white maid uniform, the matching headband appearing on her head.<br />
<br />
“So I get to serve Master full time as well?  How wonderful!”  Skyla blinked.  Luna had acted like her head maid had arranged for her to work part-time after her initial change, and now apparently the second change had further altered their initial conversation, and the people Skyla had been changing were now quitting alongside her to work full time.  All the better for everyone involved, she thought, but still, that was an interesting progression as more maids came into existence.  She started to wonder what else might be retroactively changing.<br />
<br />
“Aw, Stephanie’s quitting too?  I’ll miss having you two around,” Gabe said.<br />
<br />
“Oh we’ll miss you too, dear,”  Stephanie said, hugging the unchanged member of their trio.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you worry,” Skyla grinned.  “I’ve got something for you, too.”  <br />
<br />
With another zap, the last man’s clothes changed to another black and white maid’s uniform, as brown fur began to spread over “his” new body.  “His” chest grew quite a bit, though not to the degree Luna and Stephanie’s had.  Instead, her hips expanded much wider than her friends’ had, with a portion of her body fat moving to amplify her behind, as well.  The ears, paws, and tail formed on her just like it had for her friends.<br />
<br />
“You hear that, girls?”  The newly changed rabbit woman said.  “We all get to pack up and work at Master’s right away!  Thank you so much, Head Maid Skyla!”  <br />
<br />
<br />
“You’re practically a miracle worker, negotiating all that with our secondary employer,” Stephanie said with a curtsy.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you’re the best, Skyla,” Luna said, hugging the vixen happily.  <br />
<br />
After being let go, Skyla awkwardly realized that she didn’t know the “new Gabe’s” name.  She tried to subtly look over her desk in hopes of finding something with her name written on it.  Seeing one of the fiscal reports Gabe had been working on, Skyla tried to discreetly look over it for a signature or similar without seeming like she was snooping.<br />
<br />
“You see something wrong on Gabrielle&#39;s report, Skyla?”  Cassidy asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, nothing, just thought I saw a typo, heh.”  Skyla grinned sheepishly, hiding her startle at being reminded the tiger woman was there.  “I need to get one more maid gathered up, would you three mind helping me clear off my desk as well?”<br />
<br />
“Of course, Head Maid Skyla,” Stephanie said with a small bow.<br />
<br />
“Mind if I come with you?”  Anna said.<br />
<br />
“That’s fine with me.”  Skyla nodded.<br />
<br />
“I’ll come too,” Cassidy said.<br />
<br />
“No, I think I’ll be fine here with Skyla.  There’s not much to protect me from in here except paperwork, anyway.”<br />
<br />
Cassidy looked at Skyla.  “She’s right,” Skyla said, “You don’t mind just staying there with the toddlers for now, do you?”  <br />
<br />
Cassidy shrugged.  <br />
<br />
Taking that as a yes, Anna and Skyla made their way toward the front desk.  <br />
<br />
“So… Three bunnies?”  Skyla asked once they were out of earshot of Cassidy or the new maids.<br />
<br />
“I like bunnies,”  Skyla said.  “They can be cute and bouncy.  In a couple of different ways, in this case.”  she grinned.<br />
<br />
“If you say so,” Anna said.  “You remember the upgrade lets you pick someone’s favorite animal, right?”<br />
<br />
Skyla’s grin gained a hint of embarrassment.  “I forgot…  But hey, I still have one more friend I can change here!  And don’t worry, she’s already a woman, so there’s no worry about breaking anyone up with unexpected swapping.”<br />
<br />
“Good!  I want to see what they turn into.”<br />
<br />
“Glad you’re getting back into the spirit of things.”  <br />
<br />
Skyla turned her attention to the receptionist as they arrived at the front desk.   “Hello Janet.  Working hard as usual?”<br />
<br />
“Of course.”  The thirties-something woman said.  “What are you doing down here, though?  I’m pretty sure your shift isn’t supposed to end for another 30 minutes.”<br />
<br />
“Luna, Stephanie, Gabrielle and I have all gotten early retirement so we can work for Master Evenson full time now.”<br />
<br />
“The full package?  Wow, it really does pay to have connections.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, of course.  Master’s got a lot of people who love and respect him.”<br />
<br />
“You always make Mr. Evenson sound like a great guy to work for,” she chuckled.  “Too bad cleaning mansions isn’t my thing.”<br />
<br />
Mansions?  Skyla thought it was odd, but brushed it off as her just exaggerating Curt’s estate due to all the maids he had now.  “You wouldn’t want to be a maid?  You’re missing out,” the kitsune chuckled.  “But what sorts of things are you passionate about?  I don’t know a lot of people whose dream job is to be a receptionist.” <br />
<br />
“I enjoy cooking, personally.”  <br />
<br />
Janet did always bring the best stuff to the company’s holiday meals, Skyla remembered.  “You know, we could probably use a chef…”<br />
<br />
Janet laughed.  “I’d love to, but…  Wait, are you being serious?”<br />
<br />
“Yep!  We’d be happy to hire you.  I could even see if I could get Master to pull some strings for your retirement as well…”<br />
<br />
“I honestly don’t know what to say…”<br />
<br />
“Say yes, then?”  Anna suggested.<br />
<br />
“This is all so sudden…  How long do you think it would take to get everything in order.”<br />
<br />
“We can get you started right now!”  Skyla smiled, drawing the gun and firing again.  <br />
<br />
Janet’s hair began to vanish, thousands of bright green scales, with occasional flecks of white, growing from her skin in its place, with wider scutes forming on the front of her chest and neck.  Her body slimmed down, though her breasts went up several sizes, pressing tightly against her clothes, before they started to change too.  Unlike the others hit by the “maid” setting of the gun, her clothes remained separate as they turned pure white, and grew heavier, becoming a chef’s uniform, rather than a maid’s dress.  A tall, white hat appeared on her head as well.  A bit redundant, Skyla thought, given she was bald now, and didn’t have to worry about hair falling into the meals she was making, but she supposed tradition had to count for something. A black frilly apron formed over her uniform, to contrast with the white.<br />
<br />
As the scales spread down Janet’s arms, her fingernails shrank back into her body, the bones in her fingertips stretching out into small, dulled claws instead.  Her head, meanwhile, grew longer, her jaws stretching out into a flat, triangular-looking snout.  Her nose was pulled forward with it, her nostrils becoming smaller and less noticeable.  Her ears, similarly, shrank down into little holes in the sides of her head.  All but four of her teeth shrank into her gums.  The four that remained became longer, thinner, and sharper.  Her tongue, similarly, became longer, thinner, and far more sensitive, as it suddenly forked at the tip.  She instinctively flicked it in and out every so often.  Her pupils became long and narrow as her irises turned yellow. Janet blinked, confirmed to Skyla that yes, Janet still had eyelids, well, that did make it easier for Janet to emote. <br />
<br />
Finally, her lower body began to change, her hips widening a few inches, as her spine grew thicker, more and more vertebrae being added past the hips.  New mass formed behind her, stretching down to the ground and forming a pile around her chair, forming a lengthy tail.  Her legs, meanwhile, began to slowly shrink and wither away.  Janet simply shifted her weight to her new serpentine tail without missing a beat, as if she never had legs to begin with.  Which, thanks to the reality re-writes, was technically true.<br />
<br />
The new Emerald Tree Boa woman smiled.  “Thank you for this position, Head Maid Skyla.  I look forward to finally cooking for Master.”<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome, Janet,” Skyla said, enjoying the gratitude from the people she was ‘liberating.’  “Master will definitely enjoy having you around.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll start packing up my desk right away, so I can start up a fine meal for him as soon as we get back home.”<br />
<br />
“Good.  We’ll see you there.”  Skyla was honestly surprised, in spite of knowing about the dragons, it hadn&#39;t consciously occured to her that those transformed could become reptiles. And more than that, Janet had effectively become a... a centaur snake? Well, it was certainly nice to know over a dozen maids in, and they were still finding surprises from the ray gun. <br />
<br />
&quot;Happy to see you let her choose her species,&quot; Anna said, sounding better than before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; Skyla smiled.<br />
<br />
Skyla was about to turn around and head out the door, when an exasperated intern stepped through, panting. In his hands was a large pink box. “Oh, hey Ralph.  Did they make you do another donut run for them again?”<br />
<br />
The young man nodded, catching his breath.  “What are you doing out here, anyway?  Is it time to clock out already?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, no,” Janet said, “it’s just the maids have been allowed to quit and work for Master Evenson full time, and they even arranged for me to get a pension as well.”<br />
<br />
“Really?”  Ralph asked with a hint of annoyance.  “I never thought I’d envy a maid, but you guys seem to get all the luck.”<br />
<br />
Skyla was beaming.  “Well, we don’t mind sharing at all!”  Another bolt of lightning flew from the gun, hitting the intern squarely in the chest, which began to swell into a hefty pair of breasts.  Underneath his shirt, grey fur began to spread all over her torso.  Her hips widened as her pants and shirt weaved together into a single black skirt, a white apron and headband weaving into existence out of nothing.  A hole opened in the back of the trust, allowing a mid-length, fluffy grey tail to stick out behind her.<br />
<br />
Her legs became slightly thinner as the fur spread down them, her feet growing longer as they arced into a digitigrade stance.  Her toes shrank and curled into paws, and her nails disappeared, claws growing in their place.  Black, leathery pads appeared on the bottoms of her feet as well.  Her arms underwent similar changes, though her fingers grew a bit longer and thinner instead of shorter and rounder.<br />
<br />
Finally, her head changed, grey fur absorbing her hair, as her mouth stretched out into a canine muzzle, her teeth all sharpening into fangs.  Her nose grew larger, turning black and wet,  Her ears moved toward the top of her head, becoming triangular and more flexible, able to turn in the direction of incoming sounds.  Finally, her eyes turned blue.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad this internship is finally over,”  The wolf-woman mumbled.  “I was dreaming of a time I could work for Master like you do.”<br />
<br />
“Welcome!”  Skyla said, beaming with pride.  The fox woman twirled the gun once more.  Six new maids before she left work.  She’d love to have made more, but she realized that she had actually made two more than Master himself had during her turn.  That, combined with the fact the the next transformation would result in another upgrade, made her feel inclined to let Master make the next milestone change.  “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to start up my car for Anna, Cassidy, the Toddlers, and I.  We have things to do.”  <br />
<br />
&quot;Toddlers? As in more than Emma?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right you didn&#39;t hear. Kasai&#39;s &#39;rebooted&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Heh! Happy to hear it! Just let me drop off my last box of donuts in this place and I&#39;ll clean out my desk and see you at Master&#39;s Mansion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skyla wondered at what she meant, given Janet had chosen that choice of words too, the possibly excited Skyla but she wouldn&#39;t jump to conclusions. Skyla also realized she had no real way to figure out &#39;Ralph&#39;s&#39; new name on the spot without it feeling weird. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hiii Rachael, happy to hear you&#39;ll be working full time with big brother too!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Granny!&quot; Rachael laughed, apparently a nickname the Maids had for the toddler unicorn. <br />
<br />
Skyla and Anna turned to see Cassidy there with Kasai and Emma. The tiger grinned. &quot;Sorry Anna, you&#39;ve done that trick one too many times. No leaving me behind when Master wants me to keep an eye on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Anna blushed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kasai! Is that really you?&quot; Rachael said, almost kneeling before the fire bird toddler flapped her wings to be eye level with her. Janet said nothing, why wouldn&#39;t she? She&#39;d seen Emma and Kasai when they came inside the office building anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hai Rachael-Chan!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re absolutely adorable now!&quot; Rachael said the wolf woman giving her a pet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Arigatou!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna and Skyla for their part still felt a wave of amazement of the thoroughness of the ray gun&#39;s changes. Rachael and Kasai had certainly not known each other before, but now greeted each other as old friends. <br />
<br />
Curt might have wondered about what friendships hadn&#39;t happened, there was only so many hours in a person&#39;s life after all, but the thought never occurred to Skyla, and Anna just saw it as something nice coming out of the ray gun&#39;s power. <br />
<br />
As now the full time head maid of Master, Skyla realized she technically had all the time in the world, but not really, she had responsibilities now, and now that she&#39;d decided to have the next change done by Master, it was best to return the ray gun to him as soon as possible, there were bound to be people at Curt&#39;s programming company that could use some &#39;improvements&#39; right? <br />
<br />
Skyla stepped out the front door and motioned for Anna, her bodyguard, and the toddlers to follow.  The other maids having to clear out their (and Skyla&#39;s) desks first.  As dull as her old job had been before, the last day of work proved incredibly fun.</p>
