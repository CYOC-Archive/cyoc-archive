<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A couple of minutes after Michael called Evan to let him know of his new plans for the next day, Chris came back into the house. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know why you’re so down on him, Mr. Scavolini” Chris said, as he came in to see Michael sitting on the couch and Sofya pacing around the living room. “Josh seems like a nice guy.”<br />
<br />
“There’s a lot you don’t know, Chris” Michael replied with a snort. “If you knew Josh’s back story, the way I do, I don’t think you’d be so up on him.”<br />
<br />
“I think we should go over what our game plan is for tomorrow” Sofya said, trying to change the subject. “We are taking a risk by waiting until tomorrow to get Freddy back and trying to sneak him out of such a public place. However, until I can either get my transformation spell to work properly or we can get the ring back, this is our only choice.”<br />
<br />
“I agree” Chris concurred.<br />
<br />
“I’m having second thoughts about this, Sofya” Michael admitted. <br />
<br />
“Why?” she asked curtly.<br />
<br />
“I’m just concerned that the mayor might show up to set.”<br />
<br />
“Then that’s even better. We can get both Freddy and the ring at the same time. What’s the problem?”<br />
<br />
“Well, what if the mayor reads the inscription aloud while Freddy is on set as Buddy?”<br />
<br />
Chris and Sofya stared silently, as this question hit them like a ton of bricks. It forced them to ponder the possibility. <br />
<br />
“That’s not good” Chris replied. <br />
<br />
“If that happens to be the case” Sofya answered “then it’s easier to sneak him out, without people wondering about Buddy going missing.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not the problem, Sofya” Michael replied. “Freddy had to work hard to deflect from those nude photos taken in public that were posted on the internet. If he changes back on a commercial set like that, in front of all those people, then….”<br />
<br />
“Freddy Benson will never be able to show his face in this town again” the mayor said, as his driver took him home from his office. <br />
<br />
The mayor spent the rest of the afternoon trying to get his advisors to remember his political rivals. They got closer to snapping out of their collective amnesia, but the mayor was still unsuccessful in his efforts. In spite of showing them the ballot, the polls, the nude photos of Freddy, the news coverage and the campaign website, it didn’t seem to trigger an “aha” moment by his staff. <br />
<br />
“I mean, maybe you’re not crazy” the driver responded. “However, I still don’t see how everyone in this town could have just forgotten about him like that. How would that even be possible?”<br />
<br />
“Magic. Freddy did warn me that this ring had powers beyond my comprehension. I wonder if the memory wipe stemmed from its power.”<br />
<br />
The mayor stared at the ring on his finger, fascinated by the mysterious power that laid beneath it. <br />
<br />
“The plan for tomorrow is simple. I go to the set and read the inscription, while my opponent in on set as that dog” he continued. “That way, he changes back into a human being and then the whole set sees him butt naked in public. That way, when the photos come out this time, he could no longer deny that those other photos from April were fake. It will ruin his candidacy, and his personal reputation, forever.”<br />
<br />
“That sounds absolutely insane” the driver commented honestly. <br />
<br />
“Who asked you?!”<br />
<br />
“I’m just saying, this sounds a little nuts to me. You really ought to be careful about having people questioning your sanity like this. It’s not good if you wish to keep a hold of your office.”<br />
<br />
“I am totally sane! It’s this whole town that seems to be lost in some sort of collective amnesia! Explain to me how my other driver got into an accident like that last night?!”<br />
<br />
“I really can’t explain that.”<br />
<br />
“So until you have some sort of ‘logical’ explanation for what transpired last night, then you need to do your job and shut the fuck up!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
The driver sighed, as he pulled the mayor up to his driveway. The mayor lived in a secluded part of town, where neighbors weren’t quite as on top of each other. He had a big backyard, a long driveway to a garage and colonial style house. His property was impressive and he was proud of what he had been able to create. <br />
<br />
Getting out of the car, the mayor spoke to his driver, before he went inside. <br />
<br />
“My other driver knows to be here at 7 tomorrow, correct?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“He does” the driver replied. “Have a good night, Mr. Mayor.”<br />
<br />
The mayor grumbled, as he slammed the door and walked into his house. Back at Michael’s house, Sofya tried to talk him down from his ledge of despair. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to be in the nearby vicinity” Sofya said. “I’ll be looking out for him like a hawk. If he comes by the set, then I will work to try to get the ring back from him.”<br />
<br />
“I will too” Chris added. “Magic and brawn makes an incredible team. Just look at all those old superhero hero movies from back in the day.”<br />
<br />
“I’m still worried about it” Michael replied. “I know this is what the mayor is probably thinking of doing now. I’m just worried how this will hurt Freddy long term, even if we defeat the mayor and get back the ring.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about that now, Mr. Scavolini.”<br />
<br />
Chris sat next to Michael on the couch and patted him on the shoulder. <br />
<br />
“Let’s focus on getting ready for bed and preparing ourselves for a day of action tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“I guess” Michael replied. <br />
<br />
“Aren’t you guys getting hungry?” Sofya asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“I’m not that hungry, honestly.”<br />
<br />
“It’s getting late, anyway” Chris added. “We didn’t get a lot of sleep last night, so we should try to catch up on it tonight. We&#39;re going to need it.”<br />
<br />
“Humans” Sofya huffed, as Chris and Michael got up from the couch. “Your need for so much sleep denies you the ability to see the world. Humans spend half of their entire lives sleeping. You miss out on so much in that period of time.”<br />
<br />
“We can’t help it, Sofya” Michael replied. “That’s just how we’re programmed to function. Besides, you used to sleep eight hours a night, before you learned who you really were.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know if that’s necessarily true, as my father wiped almost all of my memories of the past. However, now that I permanently remember that I am a witch, I know that I don’t need more than two or three hours of sleep a night to be fully rested.”<br />
<br />
“So are you heading up to bed now?” Chris asked. <br />
<br />
“Not yet. I need some time to practice my magic and also to go through all the possible scenarios for tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Go through scenarios? You mean like Dr. Strange?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…. Like that, I guess.”<br />
<br />
Sofya shrugged her shoulders, as she plopped herself on the couch.<br />
<br />
“Uh, Sofya?” Chris asked her. <br />
<br />
“What?” she replied with an annoyed tone in her voice. <br />
<br />
“I kind of need to sleep on where you’re sitting.”<br />
<br />
“Go sleep upstairs in the bedroom and then I’ll wake you when I need to get some sleep.”<br />
<br />
“I kind of would like uninterrupted sleep though, if you don’t mind.”<br />
<br />
“Then fucking share the bed with Michael. I don’t know what to tell you, Chris. Now leave me alone. I need to focus.”<br />
<br />
Sofya closed her eyes to meditate, as Chris sighed quietly. He looked to Michael and ushered him to the upstairs floor. Standing outside of the bedrooms, Chris spoke up.<br />
<br />
“So” he said. “What do you think we should do about sleeping arrangements tonight?”<br />
<br />
Michael gulped, as Chris looked him in the eyes. Both of them were unsure of what to do and the anxiety was eating them up alive. Michael let out a sigh, before he answered. <br />
<br />
“I’m totally torn right now. I really don’t know what to do, to be honest with you. It’s bad enough that you fucked me this morning. I’m nervous to share a bed with you again, in case we do something together that we shouldn’t.”<br />
<br />
“Well” Chris replied “if you let me in your bed again tonight, I will keep my clothes on if you turn down the heat. Plus, I will stay on my side of the bed. That means no cuddling.”<br />
<br />
Michael sighed, before he nodded in agreement. <br />
<br />
“Fine. Let’s stay on opposite ends of the bed and I’ll turn down the heat. Let me grab some blankets, so I can be comfortable.”<br />
<br />
Chris nodded, as Michael made preparations to go to bed for the night. <br />
<br />
At Tom’s house, Buddy’s stomach began to rumble. He had gone many hours without eating and was starving. After he had mated with the bitch a second time, he learned more about her as they barked to each other. He found out her name was Lady. Tom had adopted her only a month ago. She had previous owners, but they had passed away. The children were desperate to get rid of her, so they offered her up to anyone who would take her for free. Tom jumped at the opportunity and brought her into his home.<br />
<br />
What Tom didn’t know, since he didn’t have the money to send her to a vet, was that she was about to enter her first heat cycle. She had been a puppy and a young dog up until that point. When she finally became able to breed, it was too late for Tom to have her spayed. Wanting to avoid the unwanted attention and attraction of other dogs, Tom kept her down in the basement until her cycle was over. <br />
<br />
Buddy thought he should help rescue her, but Lady didn’t necessarily feel like being rescued. Despite his gruff exterior, she insisted, Tom was a loving owner and a nice person. He treated her well, kept her fed and did his best to keep her exercised during her heat. She was happy to be with him and didn’t want to leave. <br />
<br />
Still, she couldn’t wait for the heat cycle to be over. Her nipples felt tender and her vagina constantly made her feel warm. She had such a desire to mate, that when Buddy, a fertile stud, had come in to her domain, she couldn’t resist the urge to breed with him and force him to make her pregnant. She was proud to have the puppies he had sired and hoped that her owner, Tom, would grow to like them too.<br />
<br />
Finally, after a time, Buddy started to bark louder. Freddy was hungry and wanted to be fed. Since he couldn’t feed himself, he needed Tom to give him food. A few minutes of barking resulted in Tom opening the door and coming down in to the basement. <br />
<br />
“Quit your barking!” Tom yelled. “I don’t want to get in any more trouble with the neighbors! Come on, Lady! Time to get you something to eat and then I’ll let you go outside to do your business!”<br />
<br />
Lady got up and followed Tom upstairs. Buddy tried to follow them up, but the door quickly closed on his face. After pawing at the door for a minute, he gave up and laid back down on the floor of the basement. A few minutes later, the door opened again, to Tom leading Lady back down the stairs.<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you a good girl” Tom said, as Lady joined up with Buddy on the floor. “Buddy! Come up here, boy! Time for your dinner!”<br />
<br />
With a happy bark, Buddy sprinted up the stairs and into the kitchen. He thought about making a break for it, but decided against it. Looking at a corner of the floor, he saw a dog bowl with his name on it. <br />
<br />
“Let me get you your dinner, so you can eat. I bet you’re really hungry, aren’t you boy?”<br />
<br />
Buddy thought to nod, before realizing that he didn’t want to tip Tom off to his identity. Instead, he barked once and ran over to the bowl. Tom pulled something from the cabinet and poured it out into the bowl. Buddy tentatively sniffed it and let out a whine.<br />
<br />
“Dog food?” Freddy thought to himself. “Gross. I’m not eating that.”<br />
<br />
Buddy pushed the bowl away, before Tom pushed it back in his face. <br />
<br />
“What’s the matter, boy?” Tom asked. “Aren’t you hungry?”<br />
<br />
“I am” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy pushed the bowl away again. “I’m just not eating that.”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s the best I can do for you. I don’t have anything else in the house right now. Either it’s this or you’ll have to go without supper.”<br />
<br />
Whining, Buddy stuck his snout in the bowl and tentatively ate a few pieces of the dog food. Feeling the urge to heave, Buddy pulled his face out and licked his snout clean. <br />
<br />
“That’s it” Tom insisted. “Just keep going, Buddy. Finish your dinner.”<br />
<br />
Feeling his stomach growling, Buddy resigned himself to eating the dog food in the bowl in front of him. He ate it as quickly as he could, hoping not to throw up in the bowl. Scarfing down the meal, Tom let out a little chuckle. <br />
<br />
“I knew you were hungry” he said, as he rubbed Buddy’s back. “You just had to give it a chance.”<br />
<br />
Buddy whined, as he finished his dinner. Licking his lips and nose with his dexterous tongue, Buddy looked up to see Tom opening the door to the backyard. <br />
<br />
“I’m coming out with you, Buddy. I need to keep an eye on you at all times.”<br />
<br />
Buddy trotted outside and took in the night air. It smelled good, with the scent of heat no longer as prevalent. He could hear the birds chirping off in the distance and the sounds of neighbors playing with their children outside. Buddy panted happily. Freddy loved this town, despite its many problems. This is why he wanted to be mayor; to make this neighborhood accessible and friendly to everyone. <br />
<br />
After Tom nudged him out further, Buddy decided to do his business. He wanted some privacy, but the barren layout of the browned grass yard wouldn’t allow for it. Accepting this reality, Buddy squatted in the grass and let out a shit. When he was done, he scraped his butt across the grass, enjoying the cooling sensation on his ass. Then, he lifted his legs and peed onto the grass below him. Finishing his bathroom business, he trotted inside, as Tom followed closely behind him.<br />
<br />
“Let’s get you back downstairs, so I can get you ready for bed. You have a big day ahead of you tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Tell me about it” Freddy thought to himself, as Tom opened the basement door and led Buddy back downstairs. <br />
<br />
At Michael’s house, both Chris and Michael prepared for another night as bed partners. They did so reluctantly, knowing Sofya wouldn’t leave the living room and not wanting to have Chris’ sleep disturbed by Sofya’s own need for rest later in the night. After Michael finished showering, he put on his pajamas and settled into bed under a warm blanket. Chris came out of the hallway bathroom and into the bedroom. He was wearing a better fitting pair of pajamas, something Michael decided to take note of. <br />
<br />
“Those fit you better” Michael commented, as Chris settled down on the opposite side of the bed. <br />
<br />
“That they do” Chris replied. <br />
<br />
Michael nodded, as he shut off the overhead lights. He settled onto his side of the bed, before he heard the bed sag next to him. Leaning into his ear, Chris whispered to him.<br />
<br />
“How tired are you?” he asked. <br />
<br />
“Pretty tired” Michael replied with a yawn.<br />
<br />
“I was wondering if you wanted to talk first, before we went to sleep.”<br />
<br />
“Let me see if I can pass out first and then we can talk.”<br />
<br />
“Ok.”<br />
<br />
Chris settled onto his side of the bed, as Michael tried to fall asleep on his side. At Tom’s house, Buddy laid in a corner, where Lady laid on top of her blanket. Soon enough, Tom came down with another blanket for Buddy. <br />
<br />
“This is for you” Tom said, as he laid it on the floor. <br />
<br />
Buddy settled onto the blanket and laid down with a yawn.<br />
<br />
“I’ll come wake you guys in the morning. Get a good nights sleep.”<br />
<br />
Tom walked upstairs and closed the door behind him. He didn’t turn off the dim light, so Buddy had trouble sleeping at first. Back at Michael’s house, the two bed partners also had a difficult time falling asleep. Michael laid on his side, facing away from Chris, who laid on his back. An hour passed, before Chris spoke up. <br />
<br />
“Are you having trouble sleeping?” Chris asked. <br />
<br />
“Kinda” Michael replied. <br />
<br />
“Are you nervous about tomorrow?”<br />
<br />
“Sort of, but it’s more than that.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?”<br />
<br />
Chris turned and faced Michael’s direction. <br />
<br />
“What’s up, Mr. Scavolini?” Chris asked. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know if I want to say” Michael replied. <br />
<br />
“You can talk to me and trust that I will not judge you. Just tell me what’s on your mind.”<br />
<br />
Michael sighed, before he turned to look at Chris, whose gentle gaze immediately allowed him to let down his guard. <br />
<br />
“I was going to ask you to cuddle with me, but I don’t know if I can trust you.”<br />
<br />
“It’s probably best that we keep a bit of distance from each other. I don’t want a repeat of what happened this morning and last night.”<br />
<br />
“Well, part of that was because Freddy kind of nudged us on. He’s not here. If you can promise me you won’t do anything while we’re cuddling, then I think it would be ok.”<br />
<br />
“Mr. Scavolini, I really think you should try to sleep without me cuddling you. I can’t control my bodily functions and I don’t want to hump you in the middle of the night.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll ignore it, Chris. I just miss Freddy so much. I wish I could have him hold me in his arms again.”<br />
<br />
Michael let out a sob, as a tear rolled down from his eye. Chris wiped the tear away and scooted closer to him. Their faces were an inch apart, as Michael could feel Chris’ hot breath on his face. <br />
<br />
“It’s ok” Chris said. “We’ll get Freddy back soon. I promise.”<br />
<br />
Michael continued to sob, as Chris looked at him sympathetically. The tension between them was obvious. Both of them felt the need to kiss in that moment, but neither of them made the first move. Their lips scraped briefly, but nothing ever came of it. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know, Chris. I don’t know if we’ll get Freddy back. I’m worried. The last time we had to deal with this all those years ago, he almost died. I don’t want to lose him. I love him too much.”<br />
<br />
“I’m going to do everything in my power to protect your husband…and you.”<br />
<br />
Chris reached out and stroked Michael’s hair. <br />
<br />
“I don’t like to talk negatively” Chris continued. “However, you should know that, if something were to happen to your husband, I’ll still be there for you if you need me. I won’t leave you. If I have to stay with you for a month or longer until you can get back on your feet, then I will do that for you.”<br />
<br />
“That’s nice of you to offer, Chris, but I really don’t want to consider it. Ever.”<br />
<br />
“I’m just putting it out there.”<br />
<br />
“Can I ask you something?”<br />
<br />
Chris nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“If something did happen to Freddy, while we try to rescue him tomorrow or on the campaign trail, would you…”<br />
<br />
Michael hesitated, before he finished his question. <br />
<br />
“Would you consider being my back up boyfriend?”<br />
<br />
Back in Tom’s basement, Buddy tried to sleep, finding it hard to do so. Freddy had a lot of thoughts on his mind. He was worried for Michael’s safety. He was worried about the commercial shoot in the morning. He was worried that Michael would find out that he cheated on him again with yet another dog. He could get away with an excuse for the first fuck, but the second one would be harder to explain away.”<br />
<br />
“I just miss him so much” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy let out a whine. <br />
<br />
Noticing this, Lady asked him if everything was alright. Buddy replied in the affirmative, but she didn’t believe him. She wondered about their future together, which Buddy didn’t want to address. She was looking forward to being the mother of his puppies. She wondered if he was happy about being a dad. He had been a dad before, Buddy confessed, but wasn’t very close to the puppies. They were taken away and he never saw them.<br />
<br />
Lady whined, as she wondered if it could be different this time. Maybe Tom would keep them together, so they could raise the puppies on their own. Freddy didn’t want to consider the possibility, but he entertained it in that moment. If he was permanently stuck as a dog, then he’d be Lady’s partner until he died. Unlike with Evan, who he loved very much, these would be his own litter. He wondered if he’d be more attached to them, considering it was his seed that made their lives possible. <br />
<br />
Back at Michael’s house, Chris sat back up on the bed. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know” Chris admitted. “Admittedly, the thought has crossed my mind.”<br />
<br />
Michael sat up and looked at him with a serious expression on his face. <br />
<br />
“And?” he asked.<br />
<br />
Chris sighed, as he made a confession.<br />
<br />
“If Freddy were to die or we couldn’t get him back to being a human again, and I wasn’t seeing anyone else at the time, then I would certainly be open to the possibility. I really don’t fancy most guys, but if there was a chance to be your significant other, I would take it. Freddy is lucky to have you and he deserves first digs. However, if he were to go, then I’d probably want to swoop in and take his place. I bet he&#39;d want the same thing.”<br />
<br />
Buddy made a similar confession to Lady. He wanted to be reunited with Michael. However, if he couldn’t because he would be permanently stuck as a dog, rather than dead, then he would be her partner. He wouldn’t be so thrilled about it, considering she forced herself on him and he liked men, not women. However, a part of him felt obligated to raise his young. He would take his fatherly duties seriously, should he be required to.<br />
<br />
At Michael’s house, Chris gave Michael a tight hug. Buddy laid close to Lady in Tom’s basement. Chris agreed to spoon Michael in bed again. Lady let Buddy lay next to her as they slept. Freddy and Michael were forced apart by circumstances beyond their control. They were forced apart into the bodies of someone else they did not really love. They would serve as substitute bedtime partners for the night. However, they both hoped this would not be a permanent sleeping arrangement.<br />
<br />
The last person to go to bed that night was not actually Sofya. She decided to go bed only two hours after Chris and Michael fell asleep. Instead, it was the mayor. Although it was not healthy for him to be a night owl, his anger and paranoia kept him awake. Sitting in his bed, playing with the Ruggeri ring, he decided to call his advisor Marley on his communication device. When he got through, Marley yawed on the call.<br />
<br />
“Boss” Marley said sleepily. “It’s almost 2 AM. You should be getting some sleep.”<br />
<br />
“I wanted to ask you something” the mayor replied. “I want to pick your brain about my plan for dealing with Freddy Benson tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Sir, there’s—“<br />
<br />
Before Marley could answer, he felt himself convulse. The mayor became concerned.<br />
<br />
“Marley?”<br />
<br />
“Sir, what happened today? Why am I in bed?”<br />
<br />
The mayor sat silently in his bed, putting the pieces together.<br />
<br />
“So that’s why everyone forgot about Freddy Benson. Someone, or something, wiped out their memories.”<br />
<br />
The mayor looked at the ring, before he answered Marley&#39;s question.<br />
<br />
“It’s late, Marley” he answered. “Let’s talk in the morning.”<br />
<br />
“I’m just so confused” Marley replied, before he saw what time it was. “Oh my god! It’s 2 AM. I should be getting some sleep.”<br />
<br />
“That you should. Good night, Marley.”<br />
<br />
The mayor ended the call, as he settled back into his bed. Looking at the ring, he continued to be distracted from sleep by his thoughts. <br />
<br />
“I have no idea if this ring had something to do with that bout of amnesia Marley and everyone else in this town just had today. However, if they’ve snapped out of it now, then I’ll be ready to take on that bastard Freddy Benson without my bumbling associates forgetting who our enemy is. By this time tomorrow, I will have permanently destroyed my communist rival. He will soon be out of the picture, once and for all.”<br />
<br />
The mayor chuckled loudly, as he finally dozed off to sleep. The ring was placed back on his finger, ominously glowing in the dark of night.<br />
<br />
The next morning….</p>
