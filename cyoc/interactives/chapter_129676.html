<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan was laid in his bed, staring up at the ceiling as the early mornign sunlight began to lighten the room.<br />
It had been two weeks since The Doctor had brought him here. Two weeks of mental training and abuse. <br />
<br />
He had to admit, The Doctor was smart, very smart. He covered every possible scenario. If Ethan tried to leave the house, he would freeze in possition. If Ethan attempted to contact the outside world, he would be instantly knocked unconsious by some unseen force.<br />
<br />
Ethan had once thought to kill The Doctor, two days ago, using the fire poker. The thought had only just crossed his mind, when suddenly he found himself standing and walking towards the fire. He picked up the poker and let the tip rest on his throat. <br />
Inside of his head, he was screaming, willing his hand to let go of the poker. <br />
<br />
He had remaind standing in that possition for twenty minutes, by which time The Doctor had woken and entered the room with a chuckle. Ethan was told that this was a warning, and the next time he wanted to cause The Doctor harm, Ethan would complete his act, and not freeze.<br />
<br />
So, there he lay, staring at the ceiling. The Doctor had told him that today was the day. His training was complete, and that finally The Doctor had the toy he ahd dreamed of.<br />
<br />
At that moment, the door opened and in walked The Doctor. &quot;Ethan, you will stand before me and smile as though seeing me is the most wonderful thing&quot; Same that smooth voice. <br />
<br />
Ethan pushed back his covers and stood, wearing only a pair of knee length shorts. He stood before The Doctor, beaming a huge smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good lad...yes good....lets see now...&quot; Said The Doctor, circling Ethan slowly. &quot;I&#39;ve already got what I need...your mind is now perfect, but the body...well...we shall soon improve on it&quot; He muttered, more to himself than to Ethan. <br />
<br />
The Doctor looked up into Ethans eyes, then smirked &quot;You are going to be stunning...utter perfection...&quot; He purred, running a hand down Ethans cheek tenderly. &quot;Ethan...undress me with care&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan stepped forward, his smile gone, replaced with an expression of horror, fear and disgust. Slowly and tenderly he undressed The Doctor, folding each item of clothing and setting them aside. <br />
<br />
Ethan stepped back, cheeks slightly pink. &quot;Ethan, describe my body in relation to yours...&quot; Came The Doctors voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are about one foot taller than me. You are broad and muscular, where as I am slender but toned...you have a lot of dark body hair, I have a small amount of brown body hair...&quot; Ethan began saying, looking The Doctor over. &quot;Your cock is about...six inches long flaccid, where mine is four and a half flaccid, and six hard&quot; He turned bright red at that point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan, be silent&quot; The Doctor smiled, &quot;Yes, good...Ethan, get onto all fours now....from thsi point on, you will only walk on all fours unless otherwise commanded&quot; The Doctor said sternly. <br />
<br />
Ethen fell to all fours, &quot;But...no..please stop this!&quot; He struggled to stand up, but found himself unable to balance on two legs, and fell back onto all fours. &quot;You can&#39;t do this! This is inhumane!&quot; he yelled.<br />
<br />
The Doctor grinned, enjoying watching the boy struggle. &quot;It is, but that is fine, you are hardly human anymore...Ethan, remove your underwear&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan reached down whilst on his knees and pulled his boxers off, letting them fall to the floor. &quot;Fuck you...you won&#39;t get way with this! I&#39;ll stop you, someone will..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan, unless my cock is in your mouth, it will feel as though you are being fucked by a horse&quot; Came the Doctors voice.<br />
<br />
Ethan screamed, intense, explosive paid suddenly splintering up his spine. It felt as though his pelcis woudl break any second. He swiftly crawled forward and latched onto The Doctors soft cock. The pain vanished, tears streaked his cheeks, his eyes closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better? Good boy...See, I can cause pain, but I can stop it as well&quot; The Doctor slowly began pulling away from Ethan, then grinned as the boy crawled forward, desperate to keep the mans cock inside his mouth. <br />
The doctor began growing hard, watching this desperate display of dependance. <br />
<br />
Ethans lips were slowly forced apart by the growing cock, which must have measured just over eight inches in length, and very thick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy Ethan...see, my cock is good, it helps you, helps you to feel safe and secure, no pain....&quot; The Doctor said, then quickly stepped back, laughing as Ethan screamed once again in agony, writhing on the floor, desperate to get The Doctors cock back in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please!!! No oh fuck, please help! Please!&quot; Came Ethans screamed, loud and filled with agony. It was a benefical thing that The Doctor lived so far from another, his closest neighbor being almost fifteen miles away.<br />
<br />
Ethan crawled forward, groaping out with one hand and finally found The Doctors leg. He moved closer and whilst screaming, blindly searched for that thick, hard cock. Upon locating it, he swiftly slid The Doctors manhood into his mouth and remained there, on all fours, sobbing intently around the dick lodged between his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan, the pain is no more, you will not feel the agony if you remove my cock from your mouth, but you find that your lips have fused to the base of my cock&quot; Smirked The Doctor, sitting down on the edge of the bed with Ethans head between his legs.<br />
Of course, Ethans lips had not fused to The Doctors cock, but his mind believed that they had.<br />
<br />
Ethan tugged his head backwards, eyes widening in horror. His lips were stuck! He couldn&#39;t get away. He struggled more, pulling his head back as hard as he could, desperate to get the dick out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
The Doctor groaned softly, the pitiful attempts by Ethan giving him great pleasure. &quot;Ethan...continue to try...good boy...you believe that massaging my balls gently might help....&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethans hands gently cupped The Doctors massive balls, carefully massaging them whilst trying to remove his mouth from the cock.<br />
<br />
The Doctor was panting now, his hips gently rolling, trusting his Cock deeper into Ethans mouth. &quot;Ethan...mmm...You will swallow my cum...&quot; he grunted, then groaned loudly, emptying his balls into the poor boys mouth.<br />
<br />
A vile, hot, salty liquid filled his mouth, he wanted to vomic but found himself swallowing every drop, sucking until no more spurted from the thick cock head pressed against the back of his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan...you can remove yourself from my cock, and upon doing so, you will cum on the floor, until I tell you to stop. The Doctor panted lightly, looking down.<br />
<br />
Ethan felt the cock slide from his lips. The moment it was free, he yelled loudly, spurting his own load from a flaccid cock onto the floor. Sat on all fours, he continued cumming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan, you will howl like a pup whilst you cum...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan howled loudly, throwing back his head, squirting load after load, the longer this went on, the weaker and more painful the orgasm became.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan, you still stop cumming....good boy...&quot; The Dotor grinned. &quot;Ethan...clean up your mess with your tongue, I do not want a single drop of your pathetic cum on my wooden floor!&quot; The Doctor yelled, slapping Ethan across the face.<br />
<br />
Ethan crouched down on all fours and began lapping at his large puddle of cum. &quot;No..oh fuck, I hate...please, Doctor please why?! Its...&quot; he gagged and heaved the entire time, spending almost five minutes licking the wooden floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan, sit.&quot; The Doctor said, smiling as Ethan sat like a Puppy. &quot;Ethan, you have no human voice, only the voice of a dog.&quot; The Doctor stood up and smirked as Ethan began barking, lookign desperate once more, groaping at his throat whilst yelping and whimpering. &quot;Ethan, quiet!&quot; The Doctor snapped, slapping the boy once more. &quot;You should be greatful for me letting you cum...it will be the last time you get to use that pathetic excuse of a manhood....&quot; The Doctor grinned darkly. &quot;Ethan, follow.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Doctor walked out of the room, follwoed by Ethan on all fours, trembling all over, tears once more streaking his cheeks.<br />
<br />
Ethan was lead down the hallway and through a door he had not been in before. It was difficult, crawling down the staircase on all fours.<br />
<br />
When he reached the bottom of the steps, he looked up and saw the only thing that could make his situation worse. <br />
<br />
He was in the Basement, the floors, walls and ceiling were all white tiles, there were stainless steel cabints and shelves, and in the center of the room, a large, cold looking, stainless steel operating table. <br />
<br />
Ethan began backing away, whimpering loudly, shaking his head, looking in desperation up at The Doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats that? I&#39;m sorry Ethan, I do not speak dog...if you can tell me that you want freedom, in English, then I will allow you to leave, jsut as you were when I took you&quot; The Doctor grinned, looking down at Ethan.<br />
<br />
Barks and yelps and whimpers came from Ethans lips, but not a single word. He screamed in his head that he wanted freedom, but he was unable to voice it. <br />
<br />
&quot;No? Okay then, I will take that as concent...Ethan, you will stand and lay on the operating table.......&quot;<br />
<br />
To be continued.....</p>
