<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Kyle got into the stall, he sighed and leaned against the wall to take everything in. While his memories were saying this was far from his first time doing this, in reality, those memories were just false experiences. He never actually done anything sexual other than messing around a couple of times before he encountered the watch. <br />
<br />
And then there was Cylde, but before Kyle could process his feelings on the other man, he heard grunts and moans coming from the next stall over. Looks like the surfer had the same idea. Figures, Clyde probably hasn&#39;t been sexually active for a long while, and with his new body, Kyle was surprised that the surfer didn&#39;t do this sooner. Huh, that gave him an idea. Maybe he could use the stopwatch to make Cylde a bit younger. Not too much younger, but Kyle was curious how the surfer would look like with a couple of more years shaved off. Pulling out the stopwatch, the man pointed it in the direction of Cylde and began regressing him. Almost immediately, the surfer&#39;s moans and grunt started to grow louder, which started turning on Kyle even more than he was before, for some reason. Kyle had stopped Cylde&#39;s regression at 29 years old and almost immediately unzipped his shorts.<br />
<br />
This was the first time the man saw his dick fully erect, but he didn&#39;t have time to admire how large his junk was, he needed release, and he needed it now. Kyle roughly tugged at his dick and began moaning, not caring who heard him. Fuck, this felt good. Even with his new mind telling him he did this many times before, those memories didn&#39;t hold a candle to actually experiencing this. The young man&#39;s mind once again drifted to the fantasy of those two women feeling him up, touching him all over. However, as Cylde&#39;s moans got louder, it made it harder for Kyle to block it out. It wasn&#39;t long before the women he was imagining turned into Cylde. Clyde was now the one feeling him up, the one admiring Kyle&#39;s muscles, the one kissing-<br />
<br />
&quot;A-Ah,&quot; Kyle cried out as he went over the edge and came into the toilet. He cummed what felt like buckets before he finally finished and left him a panting mess. God, if that what just his hand felt like, Kyle couldn&#39;t imagine how good having actual sex felt like. As he thought that, the image of Clyde flashed in his mind again. Was this a result of his new older body having a craving for sex, or was something deeper going on? Perhaps a bathroom stall wasn&#39;t the best place to think about this.<br />
<br />
While he was cleaning up, Kyle thought about how weird it was, now that he was older than Cylde. So, on that thought, he decided to regress himself just a little bit, so the age difference wouldn&#39;t be that large. Deciding not to bother making any reality changes just yet, the young man briefly set the stopwatch to make him younger, just back to 30. Kyle didn&#39;t change much, but it was nice feeling his stomach get tighter and his beard becoming less messy. He still didn&#39;t have abs, but his stomach regained some definition, and if he flexed, Kyle could see a faint six-pack, which was good enough for now. After all, he did tell Cylde that he wanted to make his abs visible, and it was going to be suspicious if Kyle suddenly had them again.<br />
<br />
Once both of them left their respective stalls, Kyle was greeted by a fresher-looking Cylde. He may have lost a bit of that mature edge, but he was still as handsome as ever and more defined than ever. Actually, were his muscles bigger? Kyle couldn&#39;t tell, but either way, it doesn&#39;t seem like Cylde lost any size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sounds like you had a good of a time as I did.&quot; All Kyle could do was sheepishly laugh at the other man&#39;s teasing while noting just how good Cylde&#39;s back muscles looked as he followed him out. In the back of their minds, both men had a sneaking suspicion that they&#39;ll return here after their workout as well.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, take off your tank top,&quot; Clyde asked Kyle once they reached the outdoor gym. &quot;Come on, I want to see what I&#39;m working with here. Besides, hardly anyone works out with a shirt on here. I&#39;m not.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a bit of chuckle, Kyle obliged and took off his tank top. He was a bit embarrassed letting another man examine his body so close, but it was just two men helping each other with their fitness goals, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that&#39;s not so bad,&quot; Clyde said as he was looking over Kyle&#39;s body. &quot;It won&#39;t be long before your abs show again. Though I don&#39;t really see why you need my help. I can clearly see you know your way around a gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess I do. I used to be a weedy kid growing up, and it didn&#39;t really change until I started lifting in college. Though you know how it is, work gets busier, bills start piling up, and then I found myself slacking at the gym. So, I thought having a workout buddy would help with motivation. Besides, your more ripped than I am, so I think you have more experience than me, as well.&quot; Huh, now that Kyle said that out loud, he was now tempted to regress again. Not only to get his abs back but to go back to college where he didn&#39;t have as much responsibility as he did at this age.<br />
<br />
Clyde understood what Kyle meant. He also had found less time to work out as he got older, but now that the surfer had a second chance, he wouldn&#39;t let that happen this time around. &quot;Well, you came to the right stud for help. I think I can teach you a thing or to, with my experience. Actually, ever thought about going into bodybuilding? You would need to shave, but I think you have the body to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? You really think so?&quot; Being up on a stage, flexing his muscles for all to see? Maybe even with Clyde? Just thinking about that made Kyle feel aroused again, but he managed to suppress that feeling for now. &quot;Wait, what about you? You bodybuild? Er, I mean, are you into bodybuilding?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I haven&#39;t done anything professionally, but I dabble in it a bit.&quot; Although, perhaps he should pursue that during his second chance. &quot;But that&#39;s enough talking for now. It&#39;s time to blast those muscles.&quot;</p>
