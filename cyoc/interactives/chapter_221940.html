<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wiping dust off the rather disused vending machine, you placed your hand on it, activating the ancient space crow electronic tag exchange or whatever it was that powered these up, and out dropped a capsule you easily slotted into place in your armor. The machine then powered down. In your experience it wouldn&#39;t have the juice to deliver anything else for at least a year or two. Time to check what this one did. Activating the thing was almost as easy as thinking about it the way your suit was designed, fluid or nanites or whatever it was draining out from the capsule and dispersing all throughout the suit, rapidly altering your body.<br />
<br />
First went your legs. The bones just sort of dissolved almost instantly, even your pelvis. If it weren&#39;t for the reinforced suit, you&#39;d have dropped straight to the floor, squishing your now quite floppy and useless legs. It wasn&#39;t really painful per se, but you wouldn&#39;t call it pleasant. Next, your spine grew longer. That felt a bit prickly. As it extended downward, it sort of pushed its way through what should have been the gap between your legs, if they weren&#39;t simultaneously merging together to form a flexible new tail, with your nerves remapping in a way that sort of tingled. Of course, your leg armor would also have blocked this had it not been matching the changes, snapping apart, folding and retracting, leaving you nude from the waist down. A layer of shiny gold scales formed over your new tail, which at least felt you from scraping your sensitive reshaped flesh along the rough cavern floor.<br />
<br />
Of course, your suit wouldn&#39;t leave it at that. It continued to fold itself away as the changes crept higher. Your stomach slimmed down, as did your arms. Your whole ribcage sort of collapsed inward and stretched down, protecting a few more of your vital organs while giving you a much narrower profile. Then of course came the sort of changes that convinced you this technology was really created as some sort of fetish thing for some weird pervy space crows not any serious practical application, as your armor fully retracted to just a tiny flexible harness, your hair grew out excessively as your face slimmed down, and as your shoulders narrowed, you grew a modest pair of breasts. It was a safe bet you also had matchingly feminine bits if you were to poke around your new cloaca, but you were trying to stay focused on the mission.<br />
<br />
Testing out your transformed body, you noticed a bit of a lisp as you cursed your &quot;ssstupid sssuit...&quot; and that tickle of a forked tongue. The new tail WAS incredibly flexible, and with a little practice you did manage to work out how to slither around with it in a way that didn&#39;t require the sort of broad sweeping movements that would make it impossible to get through that vent from before. Still, there was absolutely no reason you could see that the suit had to strip away your gun for this, it wasn&#39;t THAT bulky, and there really didn&#39;t seem to be a point in you growing breasts beyond the designer of this tech getting off on the idea of your newly sensitive nipples getting bumped and scraped on the rough ground or the slick metal interior of vents as you wriggled about. It also really did a number on your upper body strength. Obviously you couldn&#39;t go jumping over any ravines or likely even pull yourself up on any ledges like this. Fortunately as terrible as this change was, nothing went wrong when you changed back. Well nothing besides the usual discomfort and body horror of it all.<br />
<br />
Heading back to where you&#39;d been stopped before, you once again activate that Slinky Snake form, squeeze through, and almost immediately find yourself blocked off. Frustrated, you start firing randomly at the walls of the cave, eventually finding a vulnerable spot by the floor, and after a little more squeezing, you reach another vending machine. This one&#39;s a bit less dramatic, simply popping your helmet off half-exposing your chest as your face shifts into a freaky draconic maw. There&#39;s a burning sensation in your throat suggesting what this one might be useful for, and sure enough, backtracking your way to a locked door, you&#39;re able to spit out fireballs that melt right through the reinforced plating. Well, not so much spit as sort of... expel. You really feel your throat bulge out as you work one out, and it doesn&#39;t seem like the sort of thing you can just do all day. May have to eat something nasty to replenish whatever they&#39;re made from, but it&#39;s something.<br />
<br />
So you proceed along, belching fire at the odd door, and discovering through the instinctual urges that come with this freaky dragon head that whatever fuels those flames can be replenished by just... pouncing on some of the large freaky insects in these caverns and devouring them whole. Part of you is disgusted at this, but the dragon-headed part of you really loves the taste, and you try to keep professional about it all.<br />
<br />
Eventually you reach another impasse. There&#39;s clearly a hall leading off to the west, but it&#39;s blocked with something your blaster can&#39;t crack, the angle&#39;s awkward enough you have to go snakey again just to reach it, and your suit refuses to give you the dragon head at the same time for that. So you do some backtracking, you find a passageway you&#39;d missed... dropping out of a dark tunnel you had to slither through and landing right on your boobs was a bit painful, and your cry of pain alerted some sort of robot sentry you had a big rough and tumble showdown with, but you found another vending machine. Loading up this third capsule, you tried to activate it, and nothing happened. Just to try all your options, you activated Dragon Breath again, in case it your suit was maybe working these as a chain. It did that sometimes. Still nothing. Finally you switched over to that Slinky Snake form again, and THEN you could activate the new one... feeling no apparent change.<br />
<br />
Wait, no. It did something. There was a really awkward rumbling in your stomach, then some unpleasant muscle cramps. The sensation quickly moved down towards your... well, cloaca at the moment, where the sensation became quite a bit different. You let out a gasping moan of pain and pleasure as your transformed body pushed out a distressingly large egg.<br />
<br />
How the hell was that supposed to help with anything!?<br />
<br />
You laid there, catching your breath from the sudden surprise, and regarding the white sphere your body just produced, wondering if that was some sort of malfunction. Bracing yourself, you activated that new capsule again, a little bit more prepared for the resulting sensations this time, and sure enough, out came another egg. However, as you moved them together just... to keep the clutch in one place or whatever your instincts were trying to push you towards, the moment the two eggs made contact, they began to vibrate wildly, before suddenly shattering with a shockwave that really shook the room... and those new breasts, and some sensitive bits of that new cloaca, absolutely bringing on a sudden orgasm that knocked you off your... lack of feet, causing you to stand up, to the degree that was possible and climb onto a nearby ledge to get out of the blast zone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ssso...&quot; you gasp. &quot;I think I sssee how that&#39;sss ussseful...&quot;<br />
<br />
You really hated those space crows sometime. Still, you had a new way to make progress, even if it was... distracting, and a lot more access to this place. Seemed like there was a sort of underground jungle up ahead, and the coldblooded nature of your snake form suggested warmer rocks beyond.</p>
