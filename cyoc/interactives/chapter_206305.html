<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You look at the card. It reads: If you were a girl…&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
1. Would your handwriting be nice?&#8232;<br />
<br />
You shrug. “Well I’d hope so. It would be neat, sometimes colorful. I’d probably get into calligraphy with a little talent in it.”<br />
<br />
<br />
&#8232;2. Would you like pink?&#8232;“I mean, pastels would be nice, but I’d like it as much as any color.”<br />
<br />
As you write, you don’t notice your handwriting shift to a nice cursive. <br />
<br />
<br />
&#8232;3. What would be your favourite colour, then?&#8232;<br />
<br />
“Probably either purple, green, or blue. I mean, they’re my favorite colors now, why would I change them just cuz I’m a girl?”<br />
<br />
<br />
&#8232;4. What would your hair be like? Please describe in detail.&#8232;<br />
You’ve always wondered this, especially if you had a little more freedom with it. <br />
<br />
“I’d have a natural pale red, almost orange, but not quite. It’d be cool if I had strands of golden blonde, just to highlight the red in a darker way. <br />
They would be beautiful, luscious, long locks, naturally soft, and durable. Hair that requires only minimal maintenance, and will never fade. It would be only slightly curly, but in a graceful and beautiful way.”<br />
<br />
The black hair on your scalp starts to bleach and lengthen, ever so slowly. Not as you described just yet, but it gets there. <br />
<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;5. What would your face look like?&#8232;<br />
<br />
Man, I’m basically describing my dream girl haha, you thought to yourself.<br />
<br />
“She’d have a pale face as beautiful as the moon, soft and round, but not fat, just very elegant. Her crimson lips would be plush and just right for kissing. She’d have emerald green eyes and a splotch of freckles across her face. Because of her pale skin, she’ll always look like she’s blushing, but she’ll have a slight warrior’s look to her, indicative of her irish heritage.”<br />
<br />
You scratch your nose, not realizing the shifts in your face, your eyes slowly turning green, your face slowly softening, and turning pale. <br />
<br />
<br />
&#8232;6. What would your voice sound like? Include accents, languages, and anything else voice related.&#8232;<br />
“Man, although I’d have a slight mix of an Irish and British accent, it’d be subtle. She would be naturally a soprano, crystalline and pure, but her voice range would be incredible. She’d also have talent in voice acting, able to create any sound or voice using her mouth. It’d be nice to have her run D&D and play games with her.”<br />
<br />
You cough, and sigh, not noticing your voice go into a softer, gentler feminine sound. <br />
<br />
&#8232;7. What would your general body shape be like? Think (pudgy pear shaped), not (A cups with smooth hips)&#8232;<br />
<br />
You really thought about it. You liked all kinds of girls, but you had one body shape in particular in mind. <br />
<br />
“She’d be slim but spunky, with a cute bubble butt and a lean body, filled with compact, toned muscle. She’d be extremely strong, but still look small and feminine at the same time. She’d be short, around 5’0”, 5’1”, but she’d always give this princess look, making her seem way taller than she actually is.”<br />
<br />
You start to shrink, your clothes getting baggy around you. You pay it no mind, think it’s just the wind. <br />
<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;8. How big would your breasts be?&#8232;<br />
You blush, slightly embarrassed by the question. <br />
<br />
“She’d have two, perfectly perky DD cups, which would look huge on her body. However, they never get in her way, and they’re beautifully shaped, with perfect nipples.”<br />
<br />
You feel your shirt start to tighten and stretch, but yet you still don’t pay it to mind, attributing it to your lunch, and the bloated feeling you get right before rain. &#8232;&#8232;9. How big would your ass, hips, and thighs be?&#8232;<br />
You blushed harder, thinking. <br />
<br />
“She wouldn’t have massive thighs, but her hips would be just proportional to her tits, making her seem taller, due to her perfect proportions. Her thighs would be muscular, but just large enough where they look beautiful and toned, not grossly large. Her ass is mentioned before, beautiful, cute, bubble butt, as perky and plush as her tits.”<br />
<br />
You shift in your seat, feeling the cushion of your ass as your thighs and hips expand. You scratch it idly, not feeling the extra material. <br />
&#8232;10. What would your vagina look like? Add in any reproductive details&#8232;<br />
Your entire face is now red, and you cross your fingers, hoping no one is looking. <br />
<br />
“She’d have a plump camel toe, beautiful and always tight. It’d be extremely sensitive, but only when she wants it to be, as it would never bother her unless she actually feels aroused.”<br />
<br />
You pause, blush harder, and think about one of your fetishes.<br />
<br />
“…She wouldn’t be completely a woman though. She’d actually have a penis that sheathes within her, like many animals have. It would be a massive 10 inches while erect, and she’d be able to reproduce with it. She’d still have her vagina, and it would only appear if she wanted it to. But it’s there.”<br />
<br />
You try not to combust in flames in embarrassment, and quickly write one last thing:<br />
<br />
“…and she’d be naturally hairless down there.”<br />
<br />
You yelp as you feel a prickling… down there, but you just put it off as your dick getting erect over the thought of being your dream woman. <br />
<br />
You never notice that you already are becoming her, your pubes disappearing, as you dick lengthens and grows into the 10 inches you specified. Your balls suck up into the growing slit, and your vaginal lips plump up, a cute camel toe. <br />
<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;11. What would you wear on an average day? Not including underwear.<br />
<br />
&#8232;Fiddling with your clothes, you write:<br />
<br />
“She’d prefer casual clothes depending on the day. She’d love wearing bright, pastel colors, and prefers light and not too revealing. Usually a tank top and shorts of some sort. She’ll wear any clothing, though, and look damn good in it.”<br />
<br />
Your clothes change into a forest green tank top and white short shorts. With the lack of underwear, the size of your boobs really protrude outwears, making your clothes more revealing than they should be.  &#8232;<br />
<br />
<br />
&#8232;12. What underwear do you wear? Both top and bottom.&#8232;<br />
<br />
You shrug your thin, feminine shoulders. <br />
<br />
“She’d wear just a sports bra and boxers usually, just because they feel the most comfortable with lighter clothes. However, she’ll switch to just plain panties and a bra. She wouldn’t be a constant strip tease.”<br />
<br />
<br />
&#8232;13. Would you shave?&#8232;<br />
<br />
You shrug again. <br />
<br />
“I mean, she wouldn’t have any body or facial hair besides the normal eyebrows and head hair. It would just be a natural thing. Or at least, the hairs she does have would be so faint, no one would notice.”<br />
<br />
<br />
&#8232;14. Would you wear pads or tampons?&#8232;<br />
<br />
“Would it matter? Probably pads unless it’s an emergency, or absolutely necessary. &#8232;&#8232;15. What would you be wearing right now?&#8232;<br />
You shrug, not really caring. <br />
<br />
“She’d wear whatever she’d want. Probably a few bracelets, a smart watch, a tank top, short shorts, and sneakers.”<br />
<br />
<br />
&#8232;16. How often would you wear traditionally girly clothes and makeup?<br />
<br />
“I mean, as much as I’d need. She’d be naturally gorgeous though, and wouldn’t normally need it, nor want it.”&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Next up were the personality questions....</p>
