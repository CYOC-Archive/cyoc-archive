<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You fill out the identity request sheet, putting down a professional baseball player.  &quot;What <br />
the hell, I might as well become a jock,&quot; you say to yourself as you take the filled out <br />
paperwork to the receptionist.<br />
<br />
You wait in the waiting room for a few more minutes, and while you're staring at the walls <br />
what kind of joke this is going to be, a man in a lab coat appears and calls your name, <br />
startling you.  You jump up and walk up to the man who introduced himself as Dr. Smith <br />
and asks you to follow him.<br />
<br />
You both walk into what appears to be an average office, with a desk and two guest chairs, <br />
with the doctor asking if you would like anything to drink and pointing for you to sit down.  <br />
&quot;So, I see here on your identity request sheet you want to become a professional baseball <br />
player,&quot; the doctor announced, &quot;lets see if we can narrow it down just a little bit so we <br />
know exactly what you want.  Is there any baseball player out there you want to be like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I would love to hit balls out of the park like Albert Pujols,&quot; you respond.  &quot;Well, let's <br />
look up his stats here,&quot; the doctor mubles, pulling up MLB.COM on the computer.  &quot;I see <br />
he's 6 foot 3, and about 225 pounds, does that sound about like the size you want to be?&quot;   <br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; you respond, wondering what it would be like to be that size.  The doctor further <br />
pursues his line of questioning about physical specifications, asking you what nationality <br />
you'd like to be, your new age, what baseball position, and even what size of genitals you <br />
wish to have.  &quot;OK, here's a summary of what I have here for you&quot;, the doctor continues, <br />
&quot;you want to have the abilities of Albert Pujols on the field, 6' 3&quot;, 225 lbs, age 25, <br />
caucasian, play first base, and above average penis and testicles.  Is that correct?&quot;  You <br />
respond yes, so the doctor continues to type the information into his computer, but you <br />
aren't sure what software it is he's using as it is unfamiliar to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's continue on with your new personality!&quot; the doctor states just as he turns from his <br />
computer.  &quot;Do you want to be like a traditional jock, or do you want to just describe to me <br />
what type of personality you want?&quot;  &quot;Um, well....&quot; you stutter, unprepared to answer the <br />
question, &quot;I guess I want to be really confident, extremely likeable, yeah kind of like a <br />
regular jock, but I want to be my own kind of person.&quot;  &quot;That's no problem, the computer <br />
will help us out here and come up with a wonderfully compatible set of personality <br />
characteristics for you!&quot; the doctor said as he started typing again into the computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Final couple of questions here....these should be simpler for you,&quot; the doctor goes on, &quot;I <br />
need to know if you want a different name or if you want a new one, what number you <br />
want on your baseball jersey, and what team you want to play for.  Just an FYI, I have <br />
recruitment agreements with all of the major sports teams, so pretty much whatever you <br />
want will be what you get.&quot;  &quot;I guess I'll keep my name,&quot; you respond thinking that would <br />
be okay, &quot;I want to be number 5 like Pujols though, and I guess I'd like to play for the Red <br />
Sox.&quot;  &quot;Excellent!&quot; the doctor excitedly said after about a minute and stood up, &quot;looks like <br />
the interview process is complete, review this paper I just printed and make sure it's all <br />
right, then sign at the bottom.&quot;  You hurridly sign the paper, just waiting for the joke to be <br />
uncovered, when the doctor asks you to follow him to another room.<br />
<br />
After walking down the hall, you enter a room<br />
 with a tall, wide, and cushioned chair with <br />
restraints, as well as a IV stand.  &quot;This is where your physical transformation will take <br />
place,&quot; the doctor goes on to explain, &quot;if you will please sit down in the chair and let me <br />
affix the restraints, we will get started.  I will explain what I am doing throughout the <br />
process.&quot;  You sit down, and feel extremely nervous at the fact that you're going to be <br />
restrained to the chair.  Meanwhile, the doctor quickly fastens the restraints to your legs <br />
and begins to fasten the arms and chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;These restraints will help prevent you from being injured during the procedure.  What I'm <br />
going to do next is attach an IV to each arm.  On your left arm, the IV will be providing you <br />
with fluids, specifically water, vitamin nutrients, and a medicine to assist in the process.  <br />
On your right, the IV will be providing you with an extremely potent mixture of protien, <br />
carbohydrates, and sports nutrition to feed your body during the changes.  Both mixtures <br />
are specially mixed by computer to give you the perfect mixture needed for the <br />
transformation.&quot;  The doctor attaches both IVs to you, which momentarily hurt, and a light <br />
yellow liquid begins flowing in your left arm, and a chocolate brown liquid into your right.  <br />
&quot;I'm going to let the fluids flow into your body for a few minutes, just relax and relish in <br />
your soon to be new identity,&quot; the doctor calmly said as he he left the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, what have I gotten myself into!&quot; you think for a few minutes, watching the fluid flow <br />
rapidly into your body.  You begin to feel slightly bloated.  You can't tell how much of the <br />
liquid is left because the IV pump seems to be refilling the bags from a pipe in the wall.<br />
<br />
About five minutes later the doctor returns with a syringe in hand full of a blue liquid and <br />
a baseball duffel bag which appears to be heavily loaded, and you take note that it has the <br />
logo of the Boston Red Sox on the side.  &quot;I took the liberty of getting some of your new <br />
clothing and gear gathered up, during the process you'll discover the clothes you're <br />
wearing are not appropriate nor will fit,&quot; the doctor informs you, continuing &quot;I have a <br />
syringe here full of the activation agent for your new identity.  It acts by modifying your <br />
DNA to that of a person matching the specifications you gave me.  The process may be <br />
somewhat painful and you will still have most of your existing personality intact at the end <br />
of this step, however things may be fuzzy until we complete the final phase.  I'm going to <br />
inject you now.&quot;  You see the needle stab you in the bicep and you yelp in pain as the <br />
liquid is forcefully pushed into your body.  <br />
<br />
You feel the liquid begin to flow throughout your body.  It feels as if a burning sensation is <br />
expanding all over your body.  Your arm burns.  Your chest begins to burn.  It continues <br />
until you entire body feels like it is burning, you almost want to scream and want it to <br />
stop.  As you look down, it seems as if your hands are getting bigger, your arms longer.  It <br />
seems as if they are stretching.  Now you feel your rib cage expanding, your back <br />
lengthening, as you suddenly realize your perspective on the room has changed due to <br />
your increased height.  Your musculature begins to build as well, with your arms gaining <br />
in size until they are at least 20&quot; around.  Your pecs pull out and form a shelf, with your <br />
abs quickly becoming a six pack, causing your shirt to rip.  Your legs also gain an extreme <br />
amount of muscle, becoming like tree trunks and ripping your pants open, and your feet <br />
bust open your shoes and become size 13.<br />
<br />
It now feels like your head is expanding.  It is growing, forming into a more jock-like, <br />
baseball player-like appearance.  Your hair changes to dark brown, and a soul patch grows  <br />
on your chin.  Sideburns grown down the sides of your face, and your eyes turn bright <br />
blue as you realize your vision is now near perfect and you don't have to squint anymore.<br />
<br />
A pain in your crotch reminds you that you wanted above average sized genitals.  Your <br />
cock quickly becomes hard and starts elongating, feeling as if someone is giving you a <br />
blow job.  It becomes a 9&quot; monster, and your balls and ballsack begin to expand to <br />
provide your body with it's newly increased need for testosterone.  They are like golf balls <br />
and hang down much lower when you realize your growth is subsiding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations!&quot; the doctor said to you, &quot;the physical transformation phase has been <br />
completed.&quot;  You find it hard to think, and respond &quot;huh?&quot;  &quot;Like I said earlier, your <br />
thought may be fuzzy because your personality and thought processes aren't meant for a <br />
body like this, we're going to fix that shortly,&quot; the doctor slowly stated, making sure you <br />
understood.  The doctor undoes the restraints and then asks you to please remove your <br />
tattered clothes and you do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;This bag has your new equipment in it, here, get dressed.&quot; the doctor instructs you as you <br />
grab the bag from him.  You open the bag, to find there is an Under Armour thight shirt, <br />
baseball pants, sliding shorts, a cup, socks, baseball cleats, your jersey complete with <br />
name and number 5 on the back, and a team issue hat.  Quickly you get dressed, excited <br />
to see your new body in these clothes.  They fit extremly well to your body, as if they were <br />
custom made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great baseball stud,&quot; the doctor says, &quot;lets go get your brain working on all cylinders.&quot;  <br />
You follow the doctor to another room, to find there was a computer and a small booth, <br />
kind of like what you would find for a hearing test but only about triple the size.  &quot;I need <br />
you to get into this booth now,&quot; you're instructed, &quot;this booth will allow the computer to <br />
alter your brain's programming to match your new body.  Also, at the same time, we <br />
broadcast similar reprogramming signals from a satellite to the world, modifying the brain <br />
programming of anyone who may know you or who follows professional baseball.  If they <br />
didn't know you before, they probably will now since you'll be such a good player.&quot;  You <br />
get into the booth, and the doctor closes the door.  You notice on a shelf in front of you is <br />
a baseball, baseball bat, and glove.<br />
<br />
Next thing you know a voice has entered your head, and you feel minor shocks all over <br />
your body, as if it was static electricity.  &quot;Baseball is life.....&quot; is says, continuing &quot;You now <br />
play for the Red Sox.  You are now number 5, first base position.  You know how to play <br />
baseball.&quot;  While this voice is going on in your head, you stand up in the booth <br />
involuntraily and begin praticing baseball moves.  You grab the bat and act like you're <br />
hitting a homer.  You put on the baseball glove and act like you're catching the ball.  You <br />
grab the baseball and act like you're throwing it.  Although in your mind is seems as if <br />
these acts are happening for real.  &quot;We're programming your hand-eye-muscle <br />
coordination&quot; the doctor speaks inside the booth via an intercom.  You keep performing <br />
these moves as you hear futher voices in your head, &quot;you are extremly cocky, confident, <br />
team oriented, and gay.  You are a professional baseball player.  You are a jock.  You are <br />
gay.&quot;  Little did you know the doctor made you gay, but deep inside you know it was cool.  <br />
Eventhough you were hearing these voices in your head, more programming was coming <br />
across than you thought.  &quot;Your programming is complete,&quot; the doctor announced, <br />
opening the door and letting your new self out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck man, I need my chew!&quot; you state, much out of character, and run over to your bag to <br />
grab the can and spit bottle.  &quot;I see you're using your new personality now,&quot; the doctor <br />
asked.  &quot;Fuck yeah, I'm so glad I'm not that sorry, scrawny loser anymore!&quot; you say in  your <br />
new sexy voice and Boston accent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well then,&quot; the doctor continues, &quot;you will probably remember some of your old <br />
personality for the next few days, but your new personality will fully take over within the <br />
next two weeks and you won't have to worry about &quot;that loser&quot;.  Now, your team manager <br />
is sitting out in the lobby waiting to pick you up, so you better hustle out there before he <br />
makes you stay after practice.&quot;  &quot;Yeah, thanks man for the new bod, later!&quot; you excitedly <br />
say as you run out of the room and out to the lobby.</p>
