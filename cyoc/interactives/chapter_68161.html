<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright, ladies, let's see.  I think Sarah will be attracted to Brett, and Emily you'll find Nathan <br />
irresistible. And Kalena, now tell me who's the hottest guy in the room, in your opinion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she began in a dazed dreamy monotone, &quot;I know all the girls are made about Brett, Nathan's really <br />
popular, but I've always had a thing for Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Chad, get your butt over here pronto!&quot; snapped Ty.<br />
<br />
Chad jumped out of his seat and sprinted over to where Ty was standing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strip, Chad and then stand at attention facing Kalena,&quot; Ty ordered testily.<br />
<br />
Kalena stared oblivious to her naked dream man in front of her. Ty sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Kalena,&quot; he snapped his fingers and he was naked too. He stood next Chad, and ordered,&quot;Kalena, compare <br />
us. Tell us what attracts you most to each one of us, and which attracts you least.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty willed a pencil and paper to transcribe Kalena's answers.<br />
<br />
She liked Chad's wavy hair, but she liked Ty's blonde color better. Ty winked and his hair became wavy like <br />
Chad's and Chad's became straight like Ty's had been. <br />
<br />
She liked the length of Chad's cock, she thought Ty's was an inch too long. Ty winced as his cock shrank to <br />
Chad's cock's size. Then he willed every guy's cock in the school to shrink an inch too. He felt better as <br />
Chad's manhood retracted. <br />
<br />
Kalena leaned in and sniffed Chad's armpit, and murmured &quot;Ambrosia.&quot; She sniffed Ty, &quot;You just stink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty screwed up his nose, and smelled Chad's former musk wafting from his own pits. Kalena sniffed again, &quot;Hm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she sniffed Chad and frowned.  &quot;He doesn't smell like he used to - I guess Ty smells better.&quot; Then she <br />
frowned as she looked them up and down. Chad didn't seem to be the man she loved anymore.  Ty seemed to be <br />
perfect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad and I have a history, Ty, but you're definitely hotter,&quot; she said dreamily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. Then you will forget about ever loving Chad, after all he's Alex's gay bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad's jaw dropped. His ass suddenly itched.  He dropped his head.  Ty had left him straight mentally, but had <br />
adjusted his body so that he could only cum after being fucked by a guy. He also reconstructed Chad's memory <br />
to believe that he only excelled in athletics because Alex made him look good on the field. He felt obliged to <br />
Alex and he admired his physique. And even though he wished he could do it with a woman, Chad knew that Alex <br />
was the man for him. From that point forward, Chad found Alex's scent to be an irresistible pheromone to him. <br />
<br />
Before sending Kalena back to her seat, he adjusted her memories, so that all the good ones of being with Chad <br />
were now good ones of being with Ty. He sent the girls back to their seats and called back to look Chad over.<br />
<br />
Chad ended up losing 2 inches of height, and an inch around his waist. His butt became firmer and rounder <br />
until it was a perfect bubble butt. Then as Alex ran his finger down Chad's abs from his belly button to his <br />
pubes, Ty thickened Chad's treasure trail, and made his chest hairier while keeping his butt and back smooth <br />
to meet Alex's tastes. When he was done, he asked Alex how Chad should be clothed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first, Ty, I think Chad would look nice with a big chrome cock ring engraved &quot;Property of Alex Jones.&quot; <br />
Next I'd pierce both his nipples with rings. On the left nipple ring, I'd put a football charm, and on the <br />
right, I'd put a baseball bat and glove charm.  Oh, and a big pink triangle tattoo on his right biceps.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty willed it to be so. Chad winced as he felt the metal encircle his manhood, and penetrate his nipples. His <br />
arm itched awfully at first, but Ty made the tattoo fade and age several years, until it no longer felt odd on <br />
him. He was next dressed in a black leather jock, really tight blue jeans, a nice button down shirt, his <br />
letter jacket, and his now pink sneakers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex, you may walk your boy Chad back to his seat, and then take your own seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex grinned and squeezed Chad's right butt cheek as he walked him back to the desk next to his. Chad's back <br />
pack scooted across the floor to the desk he was seated in. Alex sat down with a massive bulge in his jeans as <br />
he smiled at his Chad. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now everyone accept the new order as normal,&quot; he said clapping his hands, &quot;Resume class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kalena turned and said brightly, &quot;Ty, come sit next to me. I saved you a seat.&quot; She patted her hand on the <br />
empty desk next to her that had formerly been occupied by Chad.<br />
<br />
Ty sat down with a grin. He set his own backpack at his feet.<br />
<br />
The teacher blinked the fog from her eyes, opened her lesson plan, and said, &quot;Now, class, we'll discuss uh, we <br />
were discussing last time. Uh.&quot; She blinked and yawned, &quot;Excuse me. We were discussing discrimination in the <br />
United States.&quot; She stared pointedly at Alex and Chad. Chad squirmed in his seat. Her gaze shifted to Kwan, <br />
and then Rico and Leray. She felt something was out of place, but continued with her lesson plan.</p>
