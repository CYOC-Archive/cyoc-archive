<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I think I’ll fold,” I stated, placing my cards down. Although Diana didn’t seem to like the fact I was folding (considering my chip count) she remained silent. <br />
<br />
“Well guess it’s my turn then,” Hannah stated glancing at her cards. Smiling impishly the girl threw two dditional chips into the pot shrinking down to 13. Hannah jumped from her seat, holding onto her loose shorts as she now measured herself. “Look I shrunk another couple of inches,” the 13 year old exclaimed excitedly. <br />
<br />
“Yeah that’s not a huge surprise,” Nacy stated flatly. “I mean you get taller when you grow up so growing down you’re going to get smaller.”<br />
<br />
“I know,” Hannah said. “It’s just, never been this young before. I mean not since I actually was this young. Usually when we play I end up somewhere in my 20s, never younger than 18, it’s just...so cool.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll take your word for it,” Diana grumbled. “Now whose turn is it? Really want to win this hand and grow back up.”  Karen and Stephanie glanced at one another before nodding. “Well it’s ours but we fold,” Karen stated placing her cards on the table. “Yeah, Stephanie smirked. “Not ready to join Diana in grade school just yet.” The other girls giggled at the grumpy 12 year old who could only snort in response. As the giggle fit passed Ariana, Tracy, and Amanda glanced at their cards. “I fold,” Tracy said. “Same here,” Amanda replied.. <br />
<br />
Ariana tapped her chin thoughtfully as she gazed at her cards. “I’m in,” she called throwing two chips into the center and shrinking down to 14. The others watched as the girls curves decreased giving her a waifish appearance while her face became even more youthful and innocent. Deanna and Nancy looked at the young teen, noticing the happy smile on her face.<br />
<br />
“Well my cards are garbage,” Deana sighed. “I fold.” Nancy had been carefully studying Diana the entire time. It appeared the girl had quite the hand. Over the course of the game Nancy had watched for any tells that Diana may have had. As the auburn haired girl had grown younger those tells appeared to become more obvious. Diana wasn’t used to losing and the idea of returning to her childhood seemed to distress her greatly. It wasn’t that she didn’t enjoy her youth (Nancy remembered a time when Diana had regressed to only 14 and been quite happy) it was the fact that she was the youngest and losing the game. Diana was always quite competitive and being reduced to a child only seemed to make her that much more competitive. Nancy smiled, she had been the first casualty of this crazy game of there’s and had been quite embarrassed when the others showed her the pictures of herself in baby clothes. “Well they do say payback is a bitch,” she thought with a smile. “Might as well act like one.”<br />
<br />
“I’m in,” Nancy stated, throwing in two chips and shrinking down to 15. “And I raise you three.” Diana stared wide eyed as Nancy placed her chips in the center of the table. As the chips fell she watched as Nancy began to shrink, growing younger. The near adult Nancy lost height and curves as she went backwards in age. Nancy watched as her breasts decreased in size going from C cups to small mounds in only moments. Soon a young girl of 12 smiled back at a stunned Diana. “So Diana you in,” she asked with a smile. “Cause it’s gonna cost you.”<br />
<br />
“I’m in,”Hannah exclaimed. The young curly haired girl threw her two chips into the center of the table shrinking down to only 11. Hannah’s eyes went wide as she shrank once more while her breasts vanished into her chest, leaving her a child. “Wow I’m young,” she whispered.<br />
<br />
As the girls now tried to one up each other I watched in fascination. Instead of one of them becoming a child, now their were three. “Too bad one of them has to win,” I thought. Suddenly it me, I could keep them from winning. Looking at my ring I impishly made a wish that no one would win this hand. The tingle from the ring now told me that my wish was granted. Looking back at the table I could see Adriana was still mulling over her decision.<br />
<br />
Diana wlooked at her hand before looking back at her cards. Their were enough chips on the table at this point to make her an adult once more but their was a cost. By giving up three more chips Diana would become even younger. As looked at her cards she was confident she could win, she had a straight flush. What were the chances Nancy had that? But what if she could beat her hand. Nancy would be the one to grow up while Diana would be left as a child of 7. Taking a deep breath she worked up the courage to play on. <br />
<br />
“I call,” she said, throwing her chips into the center of the table. As the chips clinked onto the surface she could already feel herself growing younger. Diana’s breast slowly but surely eroded, going from softball sized mounds, to puffy nipple to nothing. Diana gazed anxiously at the others as she began to grow smaller, noticing how loose her clothing was becoming. Looking towards the floor the girl gazed at her feet, which were not only growing smaller but slowly but surely rising from the floor. As she became 7 she stared in shock at herself. She was now just a little girl of 7, her body devoid of curves while her feet now dangled above the floor in the chair she sat. Looking at the 12 year old Nancy she placed her cards down smiling at her friend. “Straight flush,” she said happily.<br />
<br />
Nancy gaped at the girl, shocked her hand was that good. Slowly she now placed her cards on the table, much to everyone’s surprise. “I got the same thing,” she whispered. The others now gazed at the winning hands shocked to see the two girls had a straight flush. Diana with a 6 to 10 hearts flush while Nancy sported a 6 to 10 diamond flush. The girls had tied.<br />
<br />
“So what happens now,” Deana asked, slightly confused.<br />
<br />
“It means no one wins the pot,” I said quietly, trying to hide my smile. “It also means we keep playing to see who wins the pot. And judging by the amount of chips in the center it’s going to be a really big pot.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not fair,” Diana grumbled. “I should of won.”<br />
<br />
“Me too,” Nancy whined.<br />
<br />
“A tie isn’t a win,” Amanda stated. “So we play again. But I think we should do away with the antes for now. Pretty sure some of us don’t want to get any younger.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me,” Amanda exclaimed. “Now let’s play.”<br />
<br />
The others nodded as Hannah began to reseal the cards. Despite Mancy and Diana not being thrilled about becoming this young they begrudgingly agreed, especially if the ante rule was eliminated. I couldn’t help but smile though, at the rate things were going the woman’s group would be a nursery school very soon.</p>
