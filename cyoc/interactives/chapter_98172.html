<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It does what?&quot; Your sister says as she examines the recorder in her hands. Admittedly, it looks like nothing more than a run of the mill voice recorder with a bit of tape wrapped around it, but the old man at the shop said otherwise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you, the old man at that newly opened shop in town said that it grants wishes!&quot; You say trying not to smirk at your sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;John, I might be a year younger than you but I&#39;m not an idiot.&quot; Your high school age sister retorts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he did say that it was faulty, something about it not hearing wishes correctly.&quot; You say, sitting down on your sister, Cecelia&#39;s, bed. She closed the book she was reading and stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; She says. &quot;I&#39;ll give it a go.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t wish for anything too big! The recorder might mishear your wish!&quot; You tell her as you both share a laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then...&quot; She says as she pushes the big red button on top of the recorder. &quot;I wish... I had a limo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A limo?&quot; This was just like Cecelia, she could wish for anything and she wishes for something boring like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah, you said wish for something small and anyway I-&quot; She cut off mid sentence as the recorder made a loud static noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish... I was a bimbo.&quot; The recorder played a very static filled recording of Cecelia&#39;s wish, making it sound like she said something else.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? That&#39;s not what I wished f-&quot; She was cut off again as her eyes widened, you could see from your viewing angle on the bed that she was staring at her hand in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;My nails!&quot; She wailed, you look closer at your sister&#39;s hand and were shocked to see that her fingernails were.. lengthening! Not only that but they were changing color too.<br />
<br />
Both you and your sister watched in shock at the hand that grasped the recorder, her previously short nails were now extending past her fingertips, They kept growing and growing, until they extended all the way across the recorder, changing to a hot pink color in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-these things are like two inches long!&quot; She gasped, causing you to look at her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... sis?&quot; You spoke worriedly to her. &quot;Were you wearing make-up before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; She snapped, looking at you, only now did you notice the abundance of make-up on her face, far more than you had ever seen her wear before. Her eyelashes now extended far beyond her face, what you theorize to be at least and inch, they are also much thicker and darker than before, obviously fake. The eyelashes are paired with deep black mascara and eyeliner applied heavily around her eyes. Bright blue eye shadow is also applied generously above her eyes, bringing out her deep blue eyes which you had never really noticed before. Her eyebrows seem to be freshly plucked, now nothing more than two pencil thin lines above each eye.<br />
<br />
Your eyes are ripped from her now striking gaze as her cheeks seems to glow red, heavy amounts of blush have been applied to each cheek, giving her a youthful glow. You also notice that her skin has cleared up, no longer riddled with the odd blemish or pimple but it has also significantly darkened, now becoming a radiant bronzed color, the light shining off it. You&#39;re eyes move further down her face as it seems more make-up has been applied. Her lips are now the same hot pink color as her nails, bright and glossy, like she just applied a full tube of lip gloss. She parts them, revealing pearly white teeth, as she says something to you but you are distracted by a shiny piece of metal appearing on her left nostril, a small nose piercing has manifested on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh.&quot; Is all you can stammer as you look her in the eyes again, you can still see the fear and confusion under the many layer of make-up. You had been so transfixed on her face that you didn&#39;t notice her hair. Previously a mousy brown bob that was usually pulled back in a quickly-done pony tail, Cecelia&#39;s hair had exploded from the confines of her scrunchie and flowed down her back. That was not the most shocking change though, that would be that face that your previously brunette sister was now a stunning platinum blonde. It seemed that her hair had stopped lengthening around her lower back, this was by far the most jarring change as her hair looked professionally styled, it shone in the lights and fell down her back in silky waves. While marveling at her hair you notice that she now had a large golden hoop earring pierced in either of her ears, the hoops were almost the same size of her head, which was a shock to you as you remember your mother saying that the bigger the hoop, the cheaper the girl. Seeing these slutty accessories, combined with the many other changes that had happened to your usually meek and book smart sister was far too much to take in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is going on?!&quot; You yell to no one in particular.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t know!&quot; Replies your sister, but not how you were expecting it, her voice sounds about and octave higher and much more breathy. If you didn&#39;t know better you would say she was trying to come on to you. You look up and down her body, trying to find any other changes. Apart from the rest of her skin darkening to the same radiant bronze as her face and jewelry scattered over her body, including an expensive looking necklace around her neck, a multitude of shimmering bangles and bracelets around each wrist and at least one ring on each finger, her body seemed to look the same as usual, although it was hard to tell considering she was wearing a baggy grey hoodie and joggers, which clashed with her new overly-glamorous look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it over?&quot; She asked, holding her long-nailed hand up to her throat causing the many bangles to clink softly.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, as if one cue, her clothes started to ripple. Her jogger began to crawl up her legs, going up past her shins, knees and eventually thighs. Then they started to tighten, loosing their bagginess and gaining a glossy sheen, like they were becoming a different fabric. In an instant they changed from grey to bright pink as they finished tightening around her thighs, the same pink as her now eye catching nails and lips. She now wore a pair of hot pink yoga pants that didn&#39;t extend lower than her mid thigh and clung to her skin so tightly that you could see the outline of her...<br />
<br />
You shook your head as you looked back to her upper body just in time to see her baggy hoodie, which now looked like more of a t-shirt crawl up her stomach, revealing her tanned midriff, more toned than you remember, with a sparkling navel piercing hanging down from her bellybutton. The top continues to shirk as it gains a deep neckline, showing off your sister&#39;s non-existent cleavage. Her top now no longer covers her arms or stomach and the scooping neckline leaves her neck and upper chest bare. The top changes color to a baby blue as it gains frills around the edges.<br />
<br />
Cecelia lets out a high pitches sequel as she wraps her arms around her chest and turns around, concealing herself from you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; You say concerned as you start off the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay there!&quot; She calls out in her unfamiliar voice, dripping with sex. Now that she&#39;s turned around you notice that on her lower back, just above her ass there is a tattoo that certainly wasn&#39;t there before, a love heart with a butterfly in the center. A tramp stamp.<br />
<br />
You look slightly lower to remark that you can see the perfect outline of her ass cheeks due to the tightness of her pants, you blink a few times as you notice she seems to be sticking her ass out a lot more than usual, following her tanned legs down you see her heels raise off the ground as the socks she was wearing morph to become a pair of high heeled wood sandles that keep gaining height, eventually stopping at what you guess to be around five or six inches high with a one inch platform.<br />
<br />
You watch her swivel on her new heels with surprising finesse, like she had been wearing them all her life, as she turns around to you. Your eyes are instantly drawn to her chest, Cecelia has never had much of a chest, it ran in the family. You never really thought about it but she had always been, if you were to guess, an A cup. Now, though, there was definitely something there, pushing against the blue tank top.<br />
<br />
&quot;A fucking push up bra!&quot; She squealed angrily, taking you aback as you had never heard her swear before. &quot;I look like a total tramp!&quot; She said as she held a strand of shimmering hair between two hot pink talons in front of her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;I need to change myself back, right-&quot; But halfway through her sentence she stopped, holding a delicate hand to her forehead, careful not to scratch herself with her nails.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the room began to swirl and blur, your head spins as you fall back onto the bed. You call out your sister&#39;s name as you close your eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cecelia?&quot; A high pitched, peppy voice replies. &quot;Like, you haven&#39;t called me that for years.&quot;<br />
<br />
You open your eyes and immediately close them again, blinded by the brightness of the room. You open them slowly to see that the walls have changed color, previously a muted cream they are now bright and garish pink, you feel your hand across the bed to find that the sheets are now silky satin, not to mention the bed looks to be about twice the size.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re caught off guard by a vanity table sitting in front of you, where the bookshelf used to be, covered in hundreds of make-up tubes, containers and brushes as well as an abundance of jewelry. The stench of perfume fills your nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, hello? Like, earth to John?&quot; The breathy voice calls out, followed by a giggle. For some reason, this sends a chill down your spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cecelia? Are you okay?&quot; You hurriedly ask her, seeing that she is still in her changed form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, its Cici silly! How long have you been my brother for?&quot; She said as she gave a ten gigawatt smile. Your heart sinks as you realize what has happened, she&#39;s now got a mind to match her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cecelia- I mean Cici, remember you weren&#39;t always like that! Remember the recorder!&quot; You gasp at her, noting how glazed over her beautiful eyes are, like a doll&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm...&quot; She says as she gives a girlish pout, showing off her glossy lips as he puts one long fingernails on her chin in an exaggerated thinking pose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! Yeah! I totally remember!&quot; She gleefully squeaks as her lips form an excited &#39;O&#39; shape and she claps her hands together, causing a clacking noise as the many rings hit one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wowww this is totally trippy, I can, like, remember being totally ugly and...&quot; She scrunches her face up. &quot;...a nerd.&quot; A smile spreads across your face as relief spreads throughout your body, your sister is still in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I can also totally remember being the fucking hotty I am now&quot; She said as she gives you a twirl, showing off all her assets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally weird...&quot; She breathes as she nonchalantly brushes a strand of silky hair out of her face.&quot;Oh my god! Look at Mom!&quot; She says as she points a long nailed hand at a photograph on the vanity table. It shows you, your parents and your sister on holiday to Spain last year. But instead of the four of you standing together, Cici is now pushing herself onto you in a large hug, with one high heel clad foot raised into the air. You don&#39;t seem to be taking notice, even though she&#39;s wearing a barely-there bikini. But the most surprising thing about the picture is that the woman your father has his arm around is no longer the short business woman brunette who looked in her mid thirties, but a youthful and admittedly hot platinum blonde with tanned skin and an overly made-up face. She was also wearing a tiny bikini with the same high heeled sandles that Cici was wearing.<br />
<br />
The room changing, the photo changing, Cici&#39;s memories changing, it all clicks in your head. <br />
<br />
&quot;The voice recorder, it changes reality!&quot; You blurt out. &quot;It makes it so you&#39;ve always looked like... that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cici cocks her head to the side and flutters her eyelashes dumbly before her face lights up in a wide-eyed smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s totally cool!&quot; She says as she brings up the recorder in her hand. &quot;What else should I wish for?!&quot; She excitedly chirps, twirling a lock of shiny hair around her finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re old self back! Wish to be back to normal!&quot; You reply a bit too forcefully.<br />
<br />
She looks at you, slightly scared. &quot;But I am normal! Wait... No... Oh my god this is so confusing!&quot; She wails as she plays with her naval piercing. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be totally ugly again!&quot;<br />
<br />
This is bad. Her bimbo mind doesn&#39;t want to change back, you need to get the recorder off her. <br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta be careful...&quot; You say raising your hands and slowly getting off the bed. &quot;Remember the voice recorder is faulty, it doesn&#39;t work properly.&quot; You say slowly moving towards her.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, like, I could use it to wish for anything!&quot; She says with a twinkle in her eye, like she just realized what the voice recorder is capable of. &quot;I wish...&quot;</p>
