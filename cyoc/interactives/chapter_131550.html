<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Until the Japanese Animalia colony was completed, people from Japan would have to travel to America in order to join Animalia. Considering how expensive the trip, process, and subsequent change of wardrobe and furniture afterwards, these trips were usually reserved for those who were in serious medical need of the conversion process. Once the colony was completed, people of Japan who wanted to convert for more personal reasons would have easier access.<br />
<br />
Most people came because they had serious diseases, such was the case with Miko, Maho, and her daughters. But some people had conditions that were not life-threatening but seriously debilitating and inconvenient. Possibly the biggest exampled was a young woman named Jen. Jen was brought over to Horizon Labs in a wheelchair. There wasn&#39;t anything wrong with her legs or her spine, but they were simply not strong to carry the very unusual burden that Jen bore.<br />
<br />
Judy was the scientist who was looking into Jen&#39;s case. The rabbit Animalian had seen a lot since she was uplifted, but Jen was enough to make her raise both eyebrows. Jen was fairly pretty in the Japanese way, with a slim, petite body. However, her breasts were a completely story. Both breasts looked like they were the size of beach balls at the very least. Judy had seen Animalians with far smaller breasts, herself included, and the virus gave every female a well-stacked appearance. Though Jen was even larger than most Animalians. Her petite body was dwarfed by her massive mammaries, which made it little wonder that Jen required a wheelchair to move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I&#39;m Judy, and I&#39;ll be helping you through your conversion,&quot; said Judy, offering a hand to Jen.<br />
<br />
Jen was able to take it and said, &quot;Pleased to meet you.&quot; Her accent indicated she was well-accustomed to speaking English.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, before we help you out, I&#39;m sure you have some questions,&quot; said Judy, &quot;Did you ever question why your breasts became so large?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My grandmother said it was because I was cursed by an <i>ushi-oni</i>,&quot; said Jen. Judy gave her a confused look. &quot;It&#39;s a Japanese cow demon, but I don&#39;t really believe that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy raised an eyebrow. She wasn&#39;t entirely surprised to hear of such a thing. From what she heard, Japanese folklore is really bizarre. &quot;Well, the scientific term is what is called breast hypertrophy,&quot; said Judy, going over the notes she had printed out about it, &quot;The cause is a bit uncertain and may vary from individual. But assuming you haven&#39;t been using any drugs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have not,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what most likely happened with you is that you have a hormonal imbalance that causes your body to produce too much estrogen,&quot; said Judy, &quot;Breast hypertrophy is divided based on severity into two types. Macromastia is when the excess tissue is under 2.5 kilograms...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m well above that,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you would qualify as gigantomastia,&quot; said Judy, &quot;I&#39;m not trying to dissuade you from joining Animalia, but there are mundane methods of dealing with your problem. There is breast reduction surgery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...my medical insurance doesn&#39;t cover that,&quot; said Jen, &quot;Not as long as it doesn&#39;t put my life at risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy gave her an odd look, &quot;Your medical insurance won&#39;t cover cosmetic surgery, but it&#39;ll allow you to change species?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the Animalian virus breaks rules that don&#39;t exist,&quot; said Jen, &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I said that right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand what you meant,&quot; said Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, I&#39;m not sure if I would want breast reduction. I don&#39;t want to have ugly scars or lose too much of my breasts,&quot; said Jen, &quot;I do want to have a family today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I understand that,&quot; said Judy, &quot;Have you thought about what you wanted to become?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I want to be something big enough to support breasts like these,&quot; said Jen, indicating her oversized bosom.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the megafauna, of course,&quot; said Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;But not one of the bovines,&quot; said Jen, &quot;I might not believe in the <i>ushi-oni</i>, but if my grandmother saw I became something like one, she&#39;d...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a cow?&quot; asked Judy. Jen gave her an odd look. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, the joke was too irresistible to make. So, besides being non-bovid, any other thoughts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to rush this,&quot; said Judy, &quot;Perhaps if you meet some of the other megafauna Animalians, you might be able to make a decision better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a good idea,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After looking around, Jen happened to meet Andrew, the <i>Brachiosaurus</i> Animalian. After talking with Andrew for a while, he suggested she convert into a sauropod Animalian that would allow her to carry her breasts more easily. Jen soon got hooked on that idea and made her decision to do just that. More than that, she decided to also become a <i>Brachiosaurus</i>. Andrew accompanied Jen to the same changing room where he was converted. &quot;You know, you don&#39;t have to be mates with me just because you&#39;re also turning <i>Brachiosaurus</i>,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;There will be others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you seem like a really nice guy,&quot; said Jen, &quot;And it&#39;s not like you&#39;re seeing anyone else, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, me and Nessa have been drifting apart,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;I mean, it&#39;s not unexpected. Asides from being different species, there wasn&#39;t a whole lot to keep us together. We both knew it was more about sex than anything lasting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, we could try dating for a while to see if anything lasting comes of it,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
While Jen was interested in dating Andrew, she wasn&#39;t quite ready for anything too intimate. So Andrew just left to wait for her to finish. And Jen wanted her injection to be an unusual spot. &quot;So, you want me to put this right in your breast,&quot; said Judy a bit uncertainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t particularly matter where it&#39;s going,&quot; said Jen, who was already topless and resting her large breasts right on the table in the room, &quot;And it&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to accidentally poke me in the heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, but this won&#39;t automatically make your breasts lighter. In fact, it&#39;ll just make them heavier for a while before the rest of your body catches up,&quot; said Judy. She sanitized a spot on Jen&#39;s left breasts and stuck the needle in. Once she pushed down the plunger, Judy said, &quot;Welcome to Dinotopia.&quot; With that, she left the room.<br />
<br />
Jen didn&#39;t really feel much of anything at first. But her breasts weren&#39;t as sensitive as they looked, which was a small mercy. Then she noticed the skin on her injected breast was starting to darken. She ran her hand along the skin, feeling the grey scales forming. The scales kept spreading until they reached the nipple. Jen gasped in surprise at the unexpected sensation. She rubbed her nipples, now made of dark grey scaly skin. The feeling was a lot better than it had in a long time. It didn&#39;t take long for the changes to spread to her other breast. Her breasts didn&#39;t look much different in size, but Jen could almost feel the actually mammary glands filling out what must have been useless flesh.<br />
<br />
Then the scales started to spread to the rest of her upper body. Jen felt a surge of strength go through her bones as they started to lengthen. Her shoulders became a lot broader, making more room on her chest to occupy. She watched in fascination as her arms became much longer and thicker, hard muscles building up inside of them. Her upper body not feeling as heavy, Jen tried to stand up. But she couldn&#39;t get very up as her legs weren&#39;t quite ready to bear the load yet. The load got bigger yet as Jen&#39;s neck suddenly telescoped out, her neck vertebrate extending longer as the grey scales raced up her throat. Looking down, Jen could see the locks of her hair falling down to the table. The only regret about this was the loss of her hair, but that seemed like a small thing to lose in comparison. Jen grimaced slightly as her mouth was pushed out into a snout, her teeth flattening into grinding molars instead of the needlelike teeth that <i>Brachiosaurus</i> had. Scientists were still unsure why they had different dentition, but the popular theory was that the genes regarding <i>Brachiosaurus</i> teeth had degraded and the virus was using human DNA to fill in the gaps. Not that it was a disappointment or inconvenience.<br />
<br />
Jen looked rather ridiculous with the upper body of an anthro dinosaur on top of the legs of a small woman. But the scales had already spread over the rest of her skin and her lower half was catching up with her. The legs were growing stronger as well as longer. Her feet was losing definition as they became elephantine pillars, though her toes extended into claws. As her pelvic region started shifting, Jen groaned, feeling more aroused than she ever had in her own life. Now that she wasn&#39;t about collapse under her own weight, she was able to reach down and fingering her needy hole. Her other hand grasped one of her breasts, which no longer felt like oppressive weights. In fact, to her new muscles, they didn&#39;t feel heavy at all. Jen became so engrossed in this, she barely paid attention to her tail growing. It didn&#39;t get as long as the <i>Diplodocus</i> tails, but it was still a respectable length. Jen&#39;s moans were getting deeper, owing as much to her longer larynx and bigger chest as it was to her arousal. Eventually, she let out a small bellow as her vagina gushed. Her engorged nipples also sprayed out milk hard enough to hit the opposite wall. Jen took in deep breaths, feeling so elated.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Of course, the news that Andrew &#39;Cannonarm&#39; Thomas had gotten himself a potential mate spread pretty quickly, particularly among the Dinotopian females. Even before Jen had left her changing room, Tyra, Nessa, and Marjorie had shown up at the lab to meet her. Marjorie hadn&#39;t been a former lover of Andrew like Tyra and Nessa, but she had heard about Andrew&#39;s sexual prowess and wondered what kind of woman Jen was like.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re probably getting worked up over nothing,&quot; said Nessa, &quot;I mean, she can&#39;t be much different from me in size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a sea reptile, you have to be streamlined,&quot; said Marjorie, &quot;She&#39;s going to be a land animal that&#39;s going to be a lot less restricted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not like she&#39;s gonna be bigger than us,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, you did hear what she came in here for, right?&quot; asked Nessa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some sorta breast problem,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;But it&#39;s not like her boobs were bigger in human form than ours are. And being a dinosaur can&#39;t make them that much bigger, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew walked out into the reception area and spotted the three dino-women. &quot;Couldn&#39;t wait, could you?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever could you be talking about?&quot; asked Tyra coyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I assume you&#39;re not here to see them make that chicken into a <i>Compsognathus</i>,&quot; said Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re going to do that?&quot; asked Marjorie in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon, I think,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;I think waiting for the weather to warm up is taking too long. But that&#39;s not why you&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We just had ta meet the lucky lass,&quot; said Nessa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t call her lucky yet. We&#39;re just going to date to see how well it turns out,&quot; said Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew, who is it?&quot; asked a female voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just some friends who want to say hello,&quot; called Andrew, &quot;You can come out, Jen. Nothing to be embarrassed about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen walked around the corner looking a bit self-conscious. It was a bit odd for an 11.5 <i>Brachiosaurus</i> to look like. But then, she was wearing almost nothing. She had a bathrobe wrapped around her waist, which didn&#39;t do much except keep her vagina covered. And there was nothing she could do about her breasts except cover the nipples with her hands. And that took up a lot of arm space as her breasts were still very massive. Jen was no longer weighed down by them, but they were not going to be possible to easily cover, much less the rest of her amazonian body of curves and muscles.<br />
<br />
Tyra, Nessa, and Marjorie gaped in surprise, not expecting to be <i>that</i> outclassed in the boob department. They were hardly flat themselves, but Jen was clearly in her own size class. Tyra, though a tiny bit jealous, wasn&#39;t about to be mean. &quot;Damn, girl. You went for the ultimate tit package,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I had gigantomastia before I was converted,&quot; said Jen, a bit shyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know what that means, but you&#39;ve got nothing to be shy about,&quot; said Tyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have ta be so covered up around us,&quot; said Marjorie, &quot;We&#39;re all just dinosaurs here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re dinosaurs. I&#39;m a marine reptile,&quot; said Nessa, &quot;Ye gonna be alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so, once I get a proper bra,&quot; said Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bra? Girl, you&#39;re gonna need a bikini top,&quot; said Tyra, &quot;If there&#39;s one place you should to, it&#39;s the hot spring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Best place ta get better acquainted with yer new body,&quot; said Nessa.<br />
<br />
&quot;And getting used to Animalian nudity standards,&quot; said Marjorie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t exactly walk all the way to the hot spring like this,&quot; said Jen, holding up her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...girls, find some lab coats or something,&quot; said Marjorie, &quot;And someone get Miss Vivian on the horn. She&#39;s gonna need to do an emergency custom job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was rather relieved these other women were going to be helpful instead of being snitty and spiteful. She was already starting to feel better about her new body. She might weigh a few hundred pounds more than she did before, she hadn&#39;t felt this weightless in years.</p>
