<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kirstie then walked back to her own room. Meanwhile Greg, who was still in mikes body, had to pick up another card. He reached for it, and read it aloud:<br />
<br />
&quot;One need strength to survive, your weight will increase by 50%&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;uhh.... what?!?&quot; greg cried...&quot;hey mike, how much do you weigh?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;uhh i dont know you tell me&quot; Mike replied with a giggle<br />
&quot;no serious... how much did you weight?!?&quot; <br />
&quot;well... about 165 pounds, maybe a little over... why?!?&quot;<br />
Mike replied...<br />
<br />
&quot;shit!&quot; said Greg...<br />
<br />
&quot;whats on that card? read it again!&quot; Mike said<br />
<br />
&quot;its says im gonna--&quot; he broke off for a second, feeling a strange sensation in his gut, he could feel something, odd... <br />
<br />
&quot;gonna what?!?&quot; Mike exclaimed<br />
<br />
&quot;uhh.. oh its gonna make me gain weight by 50%...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;dude, thats a freaking, huge! dude, thats... like 243 pounds!&quot; Mike exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;uhhh...i know&quot; Greg trialed off...<br />
<br />
&quot;dude are you allright??? Leslie, get Kristi back in here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ok... i will&quot; leslie replied...<br />
<br />
Greg layed his head down on the table as those sensations overtook him. It felt like every muscle of his body was tense, yet relaxed too, he didnt move. Then his body was overcome by a warm wave, running across all his skin, and it was with that, Greg started growing.<br />
<br />
At first it felt like his arms and chest were just slowly expanding, but greg realized that it was alot more than that, all the muscles across his body were getting tense and expanding. The shirt that was oversized was quickly becoming more sutible for him. Everyone else at in the room watched as intently as Greg transformed. it almost felt like his was sore all over, but with each breath his body grew a little larger. Still bent over, the width of his back was rapidly increasing, his shoulders expanding out, larger and more muscular. Greg then lifted his head up, as in a dazeed state and was more than shocked with what he found. He could feel his body growing, but he didnt realize how big it had allready gotton. Two massive Pecs stood clear out in frount of him, actually pulling on the fabric for more room! The clothes had been wel oversized for him, but now, they were almost too small for him. Though still too long, his pants were getting far too tight in the thighs. Greg then moved his hand across his muscular chest, still filling up with more and more strength by the second. <br />
<br />
Those large Pecs were allready bigger, Greg knew it, His shoulders still broader, and his arms! he hadnt even looked at his arms before, but now, it was surreal! he couldnt beleive he owned those thick beefy arms, arms he was moving. Greg was starting to like this, actually greg was even starting to get aroused by all this change to his body. Greg could no longer see his stomach, his Chest had grown too big for that, filling the gap between the two pecs with alot more muscle. Moveing his hand across his abs though, he knew he had a tight six pack by now.<br />
<br />
What he didnt expect was for his clothes to become too small for him. Indeed, he had allready outgrown his clothes...The fabric was so taught on his chest that it was difficult to even move his arms, he feared he would tear his allready streached shirt. While still growing, Greg tryed to pull his shirt off of his expanding upper body. He was having alot of trouble in doing so, his body had grown so large that it was hard for him to get the shirt off of him, it now looked like it had been plastered on. Nevertheless, greg was trying to pull it off of him, and get it over his head, off of him, but with all this new found size, getting this shirt off was alot harder. He had difficulty with the collar, which was starting to strain on his neck because of the growing thickness of Gregs neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;uh dude, i will help ya... here...&quot; Mike came over and helped pull the shirt off of him. Within in seconds the stuggle was over, but his jeans were second in line. <br />
<br />
Still growing, Greg tried to pull his super-tight jeans off of him. While not too tight at the waist, the jeans had gotten way too small for his enormous thighs. With Mikes help, Greg was able to get all those clothes off of him, now only wearing his boxers. <br />
<br />
Gregs chest was nothing short of massive. His shoulders a good three feet across, and arms so big... well, neither Greg nor mike had ever seen such biceps, so solid and muscular... so HUGE! The growth slowed down to a crawl....finally stopping at his thick, and oversized tricepts. <br />
<br />
&quot;dude! your freaking huge!!!&quot; Mike screamed. <br />
<br />
Greg was still in a semi dazed state, and leslie has just returned with Kristi. At the sight of this enormous man, both kristi and Leslie gasped. <br />
<br />
&quot;...well, i guess its your turn Mike....&quot; Greg said in a calm voice. <br />
<br />
Though he appeared calm, greg couldnt get his hands off of himself, feeling every muscle and crevice, it was an amazing feeling...<br />
<br />
All of the players then sat back down, though everyone couldnt help but stare at this massive bodybuilder that greg had become. At only 5'7&quot; and 242 pounds, Greg was really quite large, much bigger than anyone he had ever known, and not surprizingly, Greg liked this ...ALOT. <br />
<br />
mike then roles the dice....</p>
