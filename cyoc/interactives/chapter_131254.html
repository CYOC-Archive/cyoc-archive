<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke early the next morning to the sound of a dog whining out the back. It took me a few seconds to remember where I was and who I was. Sarah! She/he was out the back. Was she the dog whining? I had to change her back. I ran outside in my nightie and cradled the dog lying in the basket where I had left it last night. Biddy the other puppy was jumping on me. But Sarah who was wearing the collar was just lying there whining. He didn’t seem well. When I touched his rear leg he yelped in pain. <br />
<br />
I sat there beside Sarah wondering what to do. Do I wait there for Jenna to wake and hope he will change Sarah back to human form or do I take her to the hospital? Of course it would have to be the veterinary hospital. The puppy was in obvious pain and was listless. I had to do something. If I took him to the vet they might keep him there. Put him in a cage. I couldn’t let that happen to Sarah. I needed to wake Jenna and force him to stick to his word.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly I got up and went back into the house. Quietly I opened the door and looked at Jenna lying asleep in Rod’s bed, in Rod’s body. It should be my body. Instead I was in Jenna’s body. That of a blond bombshell. Boy had life become complicated lately.<br />
He must have sensed me there. His eyes opened and he said “Where do you think you’re going Jenna?” Putting emphasis on the name. He intended for me to remain Jenna for the indefinite future. He had promised to return Sarah to human form last night, would he stick to his word?<br />
<br />
“Sarah is sick” I said “Very sick. You have to change her back now….You promised”<br />
<br />
He looked at me. His eyes leering at the body he had owned only 24 hours previously.<br />
<br />
“Very well, But when I come with the medallion how do I know you won’t trick me?” <br />
<br />
“I won’t. I think she is dying, you must save her” <br />
<br />
“Show me” I took him out the back and showed him Sarah, now a listless bundle of fur, in stark contrast to the energy of Biddy who was his usual boisterous self. “Ok” even he could see that Sarah was desperately ill. “I will get the medallion. You stay here with her. I won’t be long”<br />
<br />
I sat with Sarah, he went inside and shortly afterwards I heard Rod’s car start and drive off. It was only 5 minutes later that he returned. <br />
I don’t know what he was doing inside but it was another 10 minutes before he came out. I looked up he had the medallion in his hand along with the pink top I had worn as Jenna last night. He touched the medallion and top on me and I felt the Zap. “I have just made sure that you will be Jenna for the next 12 hours. Just before I came out I touched the medallion to myself, so that I will remain Rod for the day” <br />
<br />
I could see the logic in what he had done. It had crossed my mind that I might be able to touch him and medallion at the same time and hence swap back. That was now out of the question.<br />
<br />
“We must get Sarah back”<br />
<br />
“You go and get something to touch her with” he ordered me. I raced into the bedroom and got some panties from the ‘Sarah ready for work’ bag. I came back outside with them. Jenna snatched them from me. He wasn’t going to let me get near the medallion. “You stay by the door”. I watched with relief as he touched the panties and the medallion to the puppy.<br />
<br />
As soon as he had done that he pushed past me into the house, out the front door and drove off in Rod’s car. No doubt he was returning the medallion to its hiding place.<br />
<br />
I ran over to Sarah, hoping to see a change. I watched carefully, was the dog’s hair changing colour? It was, or I think it was. How could she regain her size? Biddy was only 6 or 7 kilos yet Sarah was closer to 60kg’s. How did the medallion create mass out of nothing? I knew it did so when I changed from Sarah to Rod. But …… Well I suppose that’s why we call it magic.<br />
<br />
The dog was certainly getting bigger and the hair was getting darker. There was a noise in the house. Jenna was back. “Come in here Jenna” he called from inside the house. I ignored him. I wanted to be with Sarah when she became human again. Suddenly Jenna was standing there towering above me. He grabbed my arm pulled me to my feet and dragged me into the house, into the lounge and pushed me onto the floor. <br />
<br />
“When I say come. You do as I say” he said menacingly. He reached down and violently pulled off my panties. His own pants were off. He was on top of me. My hands were pinned, I tried to buck, I spat at him. He forced his way into me. It hurt. I gave in. I tried to think of something else. Anything else. I stopped struggling. He ejaculated into me then climbed off. I lay there on the floor, rolled over into the fetal position and cried. <br />
<br />
I was still crying 5 minutes later when Jenna came back “Remember your appointment at 10. Mum will take you there” I heard the front door shut and the car drive away.<br />
<br />
Sometime later I heard the door open. I cringed was he back for more? I felt a hand gently touch my forehead. It was Sarah, or ¾ Sarah, She was naked and looking human but not totally, she was still covered with short fur and had big ears. She said “Shhh I’m back, I could hear what he did. We will get through this” I hugged her and sobbed into her shoulder. <br />
<br />
Once Sarah’s changes were complete she helped me into the shower. She stayed there with me hugging me under the warm water. I felt her gently washing me all over. <br />
<br />
We went to the bedroom and both dressed. She lent me a pair of her jeans and a top. She rang her work and told Marlene she was Ill and needed the day off. We went to the kitchen and Sarah made us both a coffee. I explained what Jenna had told me about the appointment and changing back.<br />
<br />
“Do you think you are up to it?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to risk being incarcerated. It will be me in jail not Jenna”<br />
<br />
The coffee was making me feel better “Tell me about being a dog”<br />
<br />
“It was different. The smells are overwhelming” <br />
<br />
Jenna’s phone was ringing. We both looked at each other. It rang out. Immediately after Sarah’s phone rang. She answered “Hi Mum”……….”Yes we have had a very interesting night”……… “She is still here”………..”I can drop her around, I’m taking the day off work” ……….. “If you like” ………”I suppose we could find something” …… “Ok, See you soon” <br />
<br />
“Mum is coming around. She wants to borrow some of my clothes for you to wear to the psychologist appointment. A bit ironic isn’t it. Evidently she doesn’t think any of Jenna’s clothes are appropriately modest”<br />
<br />
“What do you know about this appointment?”<br />
<br />
“Well I know Jenna pleaded guilty to breaking and entering and theft of the clothes. She was actually caught in the act. The judge ordered a psychiatric report be prepared to help him choose an appropriate sentence. We are probably best to ask Mum when she gets here. I can ask, that way you can pretend you already know”<br />
<br />
“Do you think Jenna will come back? I’m scared” <br />
<br />
“At some stage. We are in a fix. We can’t report rape because you will be the one who is punished. I don’t know what we can do?”<br />
<br />
“We have to find the medallion”</p>
