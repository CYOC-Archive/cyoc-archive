<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dean reached for the dice and then stared in surprise at all of his arms. He then changed rapidly through a kaleidoscope of colors. He experimentally stretched his body and arms as far as he could reach, realizing he could touch the ceiling. &quot;Wow!&quot; was all he could say. He glanced back at the board and rolled the dice. He rolled doubles, and his piece raced on ahead. He picked up a card and stared at it with confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it say?&quot; Cody asked, floating back up to the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think of a number between one and ten,&quot; Dean replied. He frowned. &quot;I don&#39;t know, uh, five?&quot; Dean&#39;s eyebrows shot up. &quot;Now it says to pick another number between one and ten.&quot; He shrugged and said, &quot;Nine.&quot; The words on the card changed again. &quot;Now it&#39;s one of your cards from earlier James. It says &#39;What is your favorite sport?&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s interesting,&quot; Vince commented. He glanced at the guy sharing his legs. &quot;So what is your favorite sport?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s kind of strange, but I like polo,&quot; Dean said. Suddenly, Dean stood him and Vince up. Their legs swelled with muscle, shredding out of their clothes. Their collective ass swelled up and grew another pair of legs behind the first two. A brown chestnut coating of fur covered their legs as they grew taller. Their feet turned into hooves and a tail sprouted out. Since Dean and Vince were still connected at the waist, their entire lower equine half was incredibly wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;So when you said polo, you meant as in the kind on horseback?&quot; Vince asked, awkwardly shifting back and forth between their shared legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, how&#39;d you know?&quot; Dean asked. Suddenly the card flew out of his hand and at Cody. It stopped in the air just in front of him before flying to Vince. Then it flew to James. Then it flew back to Dean. It then flew back to Cody, then to Vince again, to James, to Dean, and then finally stopped in Cody&#39;s open hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;What am I supposed to do with this?&quot; Cody asked, drifting slowly back to the ground. &quot;It still says &#39;What is your favorite sport?&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you need to answer the question now?&quot; one of James&#39;s heads suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Cody shrugged. &quot;Well, I guess my favorite sport is professional football.&quot; Cody&#39;s chest soon ballooned out and burst out of his skin-tight shirt. His four arms swelled with impressive muscles. His body took on a more rugged appearance. His hair shortened and receded slightly. He seemed to grow in age as well. His powerful legs would have thudded on the ground if he wasn&#39;t floating in the air. He looked like an impressively built muscular linebacker in his late 30&#39;s that had four really powerful arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I guess I should roll the dice now since it&#39;s my turn,&quot; Cody&#39;s new deep voice said nonchalantly. He glanced over at the Vince/Dean centaur just as another miniature man emerged out of the top of the equine part of their body. The buff man started doing push-ups immediately without even getting off of the horse part. He picked up the dice and then looked around, now noticing that he was floating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, I can fly!&quot; he announced with excitement. &quot;I wonder what else will happen to me!&quot; He rolled the dice and moved his piece appropriately. He picked up a card and read it aloud, &quot;Your enthusiasm will be rewarded. Take four more cards.&quot;  Four cards flew out into Cody&#39;s hand. He read the first card, &quot;Your new craving is incredibly specific. Good thing you can get it really easily.&quot; He shared a confused look with one of James&#39;s heads and shrugged. He read the second card and frowned. &quot;It says the exact same thing as the previous one: &#39;Your new craving is incredibly specific. Good thing you can get it really easily.&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean you get two new cravings?&quot; Vince asked, plucking another buff miniature man out of his arm. Cody&#39;s eyes followed it to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Cody reasoned. He read the third card, &quot;&#39;Bigger on the inside.&#39; Whatever that means. This last one is also short and brief. &#39;You are perfectly reasonable.&#39; Seems strange to me.&quot; He glanced over at the now four mini buff naked men doing all sorts of body exercises. He swam through the air towards them and picked them up one at a time. He threw them into his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing, Cody?!&quot; Dean asked, clearly alarmed. Vince and James were equally alarmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Cody asked. &quot;You know how much I love eating these guys whole.&quot; For some reason, the other three&#39;s alarm dissipated. It was still strange, but it made sense. Cody then grabbed Vince/Dean&#39;s front horse legs for support and swung around so that his body was underneath the horse part.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cody, you mind telling us what you are doing underneath us?&quot; Vince asked. &quot;I mean you are naked down there, and it&#39;s kind of weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s weird about it?&quot; Cody asked. &quot;Of course, I&#39;m naked. How else would I get your dick inside me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, yeah that makes sense, but why is it that you want our dick inside of you?&quot; Dean asked. &quot;I mean, that&#39;s kind of gay, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I really need to spell it out for you?&quot; Cody asked, pushing his muscular ass onto the exposed horse cock with a slight groan. &quot;I&#39;ve been wanting a horse dick inside of me for who knows how long and now I can finally have one.&quot; He moved back and forth with a pleased look on his face. &quot;So what if this is gay? This feels so good, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vince and Dean closed their eyes and hissed. Yes. Cody was absolutely right. It did feel good. Vince understood why Cody could finally get what he wanted while Dean was confused as to why Cody was waiting until now to take care of it. He always had a horse cock. Had he known that it would have felt this good, he would have let Cody do this ages ago.</p>
