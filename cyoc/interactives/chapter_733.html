<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom looked down at Max he had to be about four or five years old now, &quot;Can you understand me Max? Do you know who you are?&quot; Tom asked as he bent
<br>
 down and stood on his knee's, he still had to look down abit to look the frightened little boy in the eye's. Max was pissed he knew he was twenty five and not
<br>
 some little kid, but now as he looked down at his legs they were pudgy and fat looking, he felt weak as well. That was something he hadent felt in a long time, not
<br>
 since he was a kid, and now it appeard that he was a kid again, at leist in physical form. 
<br>

<br>
 Max looked up to Tom with a pissed off look on his four year old face, &quot;Fwuck ywuo Twom, Iwm Nowt a widdle kwid! Iwm a mwan!&quot; Max said he couldnt
<br>
 beleive the way he sounded, so child like and even his words were now child like. Max just fell to his ass and sat there, the medallion, fell between his fat pugy little
<br>
 legs and rested on them. Poor Max then felt his bladder giving way, his little eye's got wide and he looked down to see what was happening to him, he couldnt
<br>
 beleive this shit he was peeing uncontrolably now, the beer he had consumed as an adult was to much for his now smaller bladder to hold and he had also lost
<br>
 some of his control over his bladder as well, after all he was now in a four year olds body, and that happens to four year olds from time to time. 
<br>

<br>
 That did'nt matter to Max he was totally emberrised by it and his little fat face went red, and he reached down to try to stop the flow, it was to late, and Tom was
<br>
 now laughing at poor little Max, &quot;Fwuck ywou Twom, Ywou bwastwerd!&quot; Max said in a angry kids voice. Tom went over to Max and picked him up, he was so
<br>
 light now Tom thought, Tom carried him to the bathroom with his hands under Max's underarms and poor Max held out in front of Tom, so he wouldnt pee on
<br>
 Tom, Max's little underwear were soaked. Tom put him down in front of the toilet and asked him if he remembered how to use it, Max was mortified, of coarse he
<br>
 knew how to use it, this was an accident, he hadent done this on purpose. 
<br>

<br>
 Max was humiliated by all of this and it was begining to take its on poor Max's feelings and he just began to cry, he was totally helpless and stuck in this little body
<br>
 when he knew in his mind at leist that he was a twenty five year old man, but for some reason beyond his own comprehenion he was now in a small childs body
<br>
 and at the mercy of this guy he hated! Tom knew he was defencessless now to and was about to take advantage of it, Tom was admirering the medallion that hung
<br>
 on Max's neck it hung down to almost his knees now and it looked huge on the little guy, Tom reached down and took it off of Max's neck, Max tryed to stop him
<br>
 but he was just to small to. 
<br>

<br>
 Tom brought it up to look at it as Max tryed to grab it back but Tom soon had it way out of his reach. Max was fumming mad at this and just started to hit Toms
<br>
 leg, it was useless though he was far to short and to small to do any real harm, Tom looked down at max and was getting aniod by him hitting his leg, he reached
<br>
 down and back handed poor Max in his face, the force of the blow sent poor Max falling backwards and on to his fat little ass, his face stung like it never had in his
<br>
 adult life, and he just started to cry, he couldnt help it now, it seemed as though his mind might be trying to catch up with his body now, and Max knew it, he was
<br>
 getting younger mentally now to! 
<br>

<br>
 This of coarse scared Max to death, what if he turned into the child his body now was he would be helpless then with no way of stoping Tom from dong anything
<br>
 he wanted to him, Max tryed to think of adult thoughts to keep them on the top of his mind, he thought about how to drive a car and about his job at work, and
<br>
 then he did some math in his mind, it was then that he new something was defenetly happening to his mind, he couldnt do the math! Even easy math was getting
<br>
 hard for him to do, he was panicing now. Tom came back in and threw him a clean pair of the little underwear,&quot;Get changed Max! And come back out here when
<br>
 you do.&quot; Tom said, he was still holding the medallion, and he was cleaning it with Max's tee shirt, Max was pissed off at this, but what could he do he was now a
<br>
 kid and no longer able to kick Toms ass even though he wanted to. 
<br>

<br>
 Max came out and just glared at Tom who was putting his medallion around his neck now, &quot;TWATS MWINE TWOM!&quot; Max yelled as Tom let it fall where
<br>
 gravity took it, &quot;WELL NOT ANY MORE LITTLE BOY!&quot; Tom said loudly, he seemed to be enjoying the upper hand, Max didnt know what to say so he
<br>
 waddled over to the couch and just looked up to Tom, Tom smiled and looked down at him and helped him up on to the couch, Tom told him to stay there and he
<br>
 would go get him something to drink. Max was still fighting the feelings of his mind regressing down to match his body and let the whole thing go, he did'nt have a
<br>
 choice! 
<br>

<br>
 Tom was feeling suddenly stronger for some reason, as he got a glass of milk for Max, he did'tn think Max would be in the mood for a beer he thought and laughed
<br>
 at the idea of a four year old drinking beer, Toms waist band seemed to be getting a bit loose on him and he looked down at it, his beer belly was going away, and
<br>
 the legs of the jeans were filling out, he was feeling great and he pulled on the excess fabric of his waist line and pulled his shirt out of his jeans and looked down at
<br>
 his stomach, he had a six pack abb section now, and his arms felt like they were growing, he brought them up to his eye site and smiled they were growing stronger
<br>
 and tonning out, he was begining to look like Max did before he got younger, Tom let out a scream of pleasure as his body went from out of shape to that of Max's
<br>
 old body! 
<br>

<br>
 Max was fighting off sleep while Tom was in the kitchen, he did'nt want to wake up thinking like a kid also, so he fought off the sleep by trying to remember adult
<br>
 things again, but when he went to think about how to drive a car he couldnt remember how to, he had regressed past his fifteenth year by then and could barly
<br>
 remember where he was now. Max was scared to death now soon he would be acting and thinking like the child he looked like now! 
<br>

<br>
 Tom came back in and looked over at Max, Max had fallen asleep dispite all his efforts not to. Tom picked the warm medallion up from his chest and thought
<br>
 about what had just happened, he knew what had happened to Max now, the tiny pairs of underwear every where were proff of that, and now they fit Max
<br>
 perfectly! This was amazeing, he now had Max's old build, he was in the best shape he had ever been in! And he owed it all to Max and his Medallion! 
<br>

<br>
 Tom looked at the sleeping boy and a evil thought went through his mind! He could leive Max as a kid, or he could bring him back to an adult, Max would be a
<br>
 burden as a child though, he would have to take care of him and make sure he was safe and all and Tom did'nt like that idea to much, to much trouble he thought.
<br>
 But he couldnt just make him his old size either. Then he thought about it. The circus was in town! Tom threw a blanket over Max and got dressed in Max's old
<br>
 clothes and left Max asleep on the couch, Tom left the apartment and went strait to the circus! 
<br>

<br>
 Tom returned about two hours later and let himself in, he carefully went to the sleeping Max and took off the medallion, he then put it in Max's hand and closed his
<br>
 tiny hand around it. Tom then pulled some clothes out of the bag he was carrying and placed a pair of jeans over Max's hand, he then shook Max to wake him up,
<br>
 when he did Max moved his hands under the jeans that were covering them and rubbed the medallion all over the jeans. Max opened his eyes and staired up at
<br>
 Tom who had a big grin on his face, Max could still remember what had happened but the complicated thought s were fadeing fast. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Twom? ISWAT WOU?&quot; Max tryed to talk but now he really sounded like a little kid, he remembered being an adult again and sniffled as he fought off tears, Tom
<br>
 just smiled down at him and told him about the medallion, and what it had done to the both of them, He then reached down and pulled it by its chain out of Max's
<br>
 grip and set it down out of Max's reach. &quot;Your going to be an adult again Max! Ive seen to that!&quot; Tom said as he sat back down on the couch. &quot;What dwo you
<br>
 mwean twom?&quot; Max asked as he began to feel stronger, and felt himself starting to grow again. 
<br>

<br>
 Tom smiled, Max looked down at the jeans that he had draped over his hands and picked them up, they were tiny looking jeans though,&quot;WHAT ARE THESE!&quot;
<br>
 Max said in an almost adult tone, he looked down at his chest and it was starting to grow hair again, and he could feel his facial hair coming back as well, he
<br>
 quickly reached up and felt the beginings of a mustash and a beard growing on his still to small face, &quot;WHATS GOING ON HERE TOM?&quot; Max said with a
<br>
 panicky voice, &quot;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?&quot; Max was tripping out he was getting older but not to much bigger, &quot;Whats happening to me? Im not
<br>
 getting taller!Im the same height as I was!&quot; &quot;NAHH your a bit taller trust me!&quot; Tom said as the process started to level off and Max felt like an adult again. Max still
<br>
 had to crawl off the couch though and he was scared to death, Tom was laughing his ass off at him as he ran with only the now tight underwear around him for his
<br>
 room and the big full leanth mirror in the room. Max got to it and froze in his tracks, his face looked like it did before all of this happened but his body was short
<br>
 and skinny and all out of propotion! He was a dwarf now! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;OHH GOOD NOOO!!!!&quot; Max screamed as Tom wandered back into the room, &quot;OH GOD YES MAX!&quot; Tom said with an evil grin, Max feel to his tiny knees
<br>
 and threw his face in his miss shapen hands and started to cry, Tom had stollen his size and turned him in to a circus freak, Max's whole life had just changed for
<br>
 the worst, at leist before he could have grown back up to the big guy he was but now he was some kind of freak! Tom looked down at the 3 foot tall Max and
<br>
 said, &quot;Well at leist your a cute little freak Max!&quot; Tom smiled and left Max by himself!</p>
