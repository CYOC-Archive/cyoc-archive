<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Uhh... I thought we&#39;d just go home,&quot; Finn said. &quot;Maybe we could invite some people over and play a game or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? I&#39;d down with ever as long as it&#39;s with you bud,&quot; Dave nodded as he finished his second margarita. The waiter was already ready with a third as the ice hit the bottom of the glass. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he smiled, sloshing it around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a problem,&quot; the waiter said. &quot;No rush, but will this be on one bill or three?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave was about to speak up, but Jeff handed the waiter a credit card. &quot;Ones fine.&quot; The waiter thanked him and headed to ring them out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really man? Going to upstage me like that?&quot; Dave asked. There was still a hint of play in it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I&#39;m just expecting something tonight,&quot; Jeff teased back.<br />
<br />
Dave matched Jeff&#39;s intensity. &quot;Oh? Does the big kitty like to play rough?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been known to,&quot; Jeff continued. The two were mere inches apart as they continued to test the other.<br />
<br />
It was Finn who let out a moan as his hands were both under the table. The big buff tiger and the burly ram cocked an eye at their observer. A vicious grin appeared on both their faces as they knew exactly what the small fox was thinking. The bright red tail wagged excitedly at the thought of them making out. But the help from the half finished margarita really took Finn&#39;s more reserved nature out of him. A doofy smile filled his face as his face burned bright red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Dave started, &quot;should we indulge our audience?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see why not,&quot; Jeff smiled back. The two scooted a bit closer as they leaned in for an actual kiss. Their lips locked and the sweet but salty taste of the margarita danced around their tongues as they gently wrestled with each other. Jeff was surprised how reserved Dave was being. He was the one taking the lead, leaning in more and choosing where the kiss was leading. But feeling the ram&#39;s hands grip his powerful muscles, Jeff couldn&#39;t help but wonder if it was just because he was distracted. The confident teasing being more of a defense mechanism to appear tougher than he actually was.<br />
<br />
Either way, Dave was really infatuated with testing Jeff&#39;s bicep, squeezing it and running his hand down the massive muscle. Not that Jeff wasn&#39;t enjoying himself either. What had been a simple joke quickly turned into a more intimate kiss as one of his hands gently ran down the swell of Dave&#39;s back and gave the large booty a proper squeeze. Jeff felt Dave&#39;s surprise in the kiss. Or maybe it was just the smile on the ram&#39;s mouth that really sealed the deal.<br />
<br />
The two pulled apart, a bit of saliva dripped from Dave&#39;s mouth. &quot;Think he enjoyed it?&quot; Jeff asked. The red fur on Finn&#39;s face beamed brighter as he had trouble blinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say so,&quot; Dave pet Finn&#39;s hair, running the fox&#39;s ears back that popped up each time his hand went too far. <br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; the waiter said as he plopped the receipt and Jeff&#39;s card down on the table. &quot;Just sign the top copy and the bottom&#39;s yours. But I think that&#39;s pretty obvious.&quot; He added a wink as he went to help another table. <br />
<br />
The waiter was already gone before Finn popped out of his daze. &quot;Hey!&quot; he looked around as though he was offended, but still wasn&#39;t sure what he was supposed to be offended about. &quot;Hmph,&quot; he huffed, sitting back in his chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Dave smiled. &quot;I&#39;m sure we can make it up for you later. But right now, I think we need to get ready to party. Ready to go?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Finn&#39;s still not finished his drink,&quot; Jeff pointed at the half-finished margarita. <br />
<br />
Dave took the glass and tipped it back, finishing it off. He added a gasp of air as though it&#39;d been some kind of challenge. &quot;Done,&quot; Dave smiled. &quot;Let&#39;s get going,&quot; he pulled out his keys and jingled them in front of the guys.<br />
<br />
Jeff was quick to grab them. &quot;Not with you driving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww... What? I&#39;m barely buzzed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That three and a half drinks says different. Besides, you look as bad as Finn,&quot; Jeff shot back. The little fox struggled to get down from the chair and walked with a bit of a zigzag. Though, that may have been more because his cock was running down his right leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m driving. It&#39;s my car,&quot; Dave said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Jeff retorted and dashed for the door. He was in the parking lot before he spun around to see the large ram barreling towards him. However, Jeff was ready. He planted his feet and leaned down far enough to properly get under the burly beast. With a heavy huff, he lifted the bigger man, tossing him over his shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m. Driving. Us. Home,&quot; adding a firm slap to Dave&#39;s bottom with his other hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine...&quot; Dave relented as he was let back down to the ground. The sudden change in direction made him realize just how disoriented he was. Not to mention that his butt hurt now. He rubbed the tender area as he headed back to his car. Finn was close behind and the three headed back to Finn&#39;s house. &quot;But there better be more beer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn pulled out his phone. &quot; Don&#39;t worry. There is. Dad bought a bunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good man,&quot; Dave pat Finn on the shoulder. &quot;Sounds like a great dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn silently laughed at the compliment to himself. Though the beer was now only there because of Finn. He quickly added a few more lines. &quot;I&#39;m inviting Adrian, Paul, Brad and Isaac.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoever you want to invite is good with me,&quot; Dave said. &quot;You don&#39;t think they&#39;ll complain there&#39;s no girls though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah...&quot; Finn cast a devious smile as he spoke. &quot;They&#39;ll be more than happy with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded as he watched Finn type into the Chronivac. He could only wonder what the small fox had in store for the night.</p>
