<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William came downstairs shortly after Martha did and could soon pick up the scent of pancakes being cooked in the kitchen. He eagerly licked his lips at the prospect and felt well invigorated for the new day, despite the lengthy and passionate round of were-sex that he and Martha enjoyed the night before. He wondered if being a were meant that his &quot;batteries&quot; would recharge quicker than they did before, but much of that wasn&#39;t too much of a concern. The threat Yvette had posed to his family was gone and the Anderson family could enjoy their new lives in Moon Lake. There were still plenty of things that would need to be done to fully settle in, but they would all be peaceful and good for his family. He set his briefcase down by the front door and then made his way into the kitchen where Martha was in the kitchen. A manila folder was in his hands as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, beautiful,&quot; William said to Martha as he entered the kitchen. While he was dressed to go into to work, Martha for the moment had only put on a nightgown to cook breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Martha smiled back, &quot;All the pancakes should be ready for everybody soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
William made note of the stack of cooked pancakes on a platter with a tub of margarine and a bottle of maple syrup sitting next to it. It looked and smelled delicious. He then held up the manila folder for Martha to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got all your old records and certificates here,&quot; William said to her, &quot;That should be enough to let you apply for a substitute&#39;s position if they have openings or will be willing to have more substitute teachers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Will,&quot; Martha nodded, &quot;Just remember you&#39;ll need to talk to the Dean about the tests to get my certification back up to date.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded. The PRAXIS tests were normally issued at specific times of the year, usually the spring to summer, but he didn&#39;t know if Moon Lake in its own way had its own special agreements to let the tests be taken again at times that they weren&#39;t normally issued. The Dean would be the one to talk to for that regarding the PRAXIS and any potential state test that Martha might also have to take.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll let you know this evening before you have your night with the Twists,&quot; he said to her.<br />
<br />
Martha nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So any plans for today, other than seeing if Moon Lake wants a new substitute teacher and possibly a new elementary school teacher in future?&quot; William asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured I may do a bit of shopping,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;I&#39;m too big for my old bras and panties... and with the pants and shorts that I have... I could probably stand to find some that have some feature that will shift with me when I change. You could probably stand to get something like that too.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded. Transforming to his werefox form didn&#39;t hurt and to a certain degree even felt pleasurable, but his tail presented some issues, just as they did for Martha. Jeans, khakis, and other dress pants had nothing that would easily give and shift for his tail, which meant he had to pull his pants down a bit to let his tail grow out above the top of his pants. Though with his workload, he wouldn&#39;t get a chance to go looking for them until the weekend, unless the stores in Moon Lake had long hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;All part of adapting things to what we are, eh?&quot; William asked with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Martha laughed back, &quot;though with some it may not even be necessary... my girls feel firm enough that I may not need a bra now...&quot;<br />
<br />
William came close to playfully nibble at her neck, &quot;ah but you&#39;re forgetting the most important thing most bras are for...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Martha raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;To hold your partner&#39;s attention while you take it off,&quot; William smiled to her.<br />
<br />
Martha chuckled, and with her new libido that made sense, but she kept her cool. She could hear the shower running and figured Eric was getting clean, since Nate showered the night before, and thus also knew that Nate would be down soon and they&#39;d all need to get ready for the day. As much as a part of her was very willing for a morning quickie, she didn&#39;t want to make anyone late.<br />
<br />
William then pulled back and then spoke holding up the manila envelope, &quot;I&#39;ll place this on the little end table in the entryway. I&#39;ll also set the car keys on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The car keys?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we aren&#39;t too far from the college and the walk would do me good,&quot; William answered, &quot;besides, if you go shopping, you&#39;ll need some way to carry everything back. You can even drive the boys to school. Wish Eric the best of luck on his date.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha blinked as William then left the kitchen to set down the envelope and the car keys. As he left from the kitchen&#39;s entryway to the dinning room Nate came down and into the kitchen from the living room. Martha still heard the shower running as Nate entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning mom,&quot; Nate said as he entered, &quot;pancakes today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha nodded and carefully let her werecat senses check Nate&#39;s scent. And as William had reported to her last night, Nate had had sex the night before. There was the faint sign of another scent on him. It wasn&#39;t strong enough to tell who Nate had had sex with, but the faint sign was enough to know that Nate had become sexually active. &quot;So... who is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Nate asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were WITH someone last night,&quot; Martha answered as she heard William returning to the kitchen area, &quot;the scent is faint... but it&#39;s there...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate froze and blinked as William looked too him from the doorway and while Martha finished cooking the last of the pancakes. He thought he had washed Alex&#39;s scent off of him, yet his mother had caught some hint of his scent, but it wasn&#39;t enough for his parents to know that the scent belonged to a male. They&#39;d only assumed the scent belonged to a female.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... uh...&quot; Nate began slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen... son,&quot; William spoke, &quot;we aren&#39;t mad at you. We might have preferred you wait until you&#39;re older...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we know just how strong our new libidos can be,&quot; Martha picked up, remembering her time with the Twists and the two nights of passionate sex with William, &quot;and in a way...&quot; Martha paused to glance to William, &quot;... it is a very passionate feeling and can understand your wish to feel that passion...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;ll need to be careful,&quot; William finished, &quot;we don&#39;t want you turning a normal who doesn&#39;t want to be a were... and neither do we want to find ourselves becoming grandparents before you&#39;re even in college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no threat of that,&quot; Nate mumbled off hand and then gasped when he realized he had only meant to think that.<br />
<br />
&quot;No threat?&quot; William asked, &quot;what if she hasn&#39;t taken a birth control pill? You can&#39;t control that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... uh...&quot; Nate said slowly, not knowing what to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only way there would be no threat of a pregnancy would be...&quot; Martha began and her eyes then widened, &quot;... if you weren&#39;t with a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate looked on in horror as his parents traded glances.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were with a male,&quot; William and Martha said together in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Nate said slowly. He couldn&#39;t deny it and didn&#39;t want to, but he had hoped that he could have kept it quiet until he was sure things would do well.<br />
<br />
Both William and Martha approached him and he found himself flanked by both parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay,&quot; William said to him, &quot;your mom is bi, remember... and there is nothing wrong with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll always be our son, Nate,&quot; Martha purred to him, &quot;and we will always love you as parents will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t care that I&#39;m gay?&quot; Nate asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We want you to be happy,&quot; Martha assured him, &quot;whether or not its with a woman or a man...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as you&#39;re happy,&quot; William finished, &quot;We don&#39;t mind... we can talk more later if you like... but right now, you and Eric need to finish getting ready fro school and we all have breakfast to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate could only give a relieved smile as they broke up the hug for a moment. No one had rejected him and there was no explosion from his parents at each other and that made him feel a lot more comfortable. And William really found himself not caring that his son was gay. True he would have preferred to have Nate provide him with grandchildren, but then neither he nor Martha had ever had anything against gays while in Minnesota and the same part of his bond as a werefox to Martha that made him okay with her being bisexual was also okay with Nate&#39;s orientation. After all, the Twists had adopted Ben. Nate and whoever he was seeing could adopt a child at some point in the future too. Martha found herself being understanding from a more personal level. Becoming a werecat and embracing the duel nature of her own sexuality had helped her get over the strain she had put on herself by repressing it. And that William was fine with her being bi and having such good friends in the Twists made her proud to fully embrace being bisexual. Nate was her son, and if he was gay, he had the right to be proud in who he was, not to repress it and repeat her mistakes.<br />
<br />
&quot;This doesn&#39;t get between you?&quot; Nate asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Son... what strained your mother&#39;s and my marriage was MY stupid mistakes,&quot; William said to him, &quot;your orientation is a surprise...but it&#39;s not our place to say who you should be. My folks felt I should have worked in the lumber industry like they did. They never understood my interest in academics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And even we did have issues with it...&quot; Martha commented, &quot;it&#39;s YOUR life and YOUR happiness. Don&#39;t try to be straight because you think it&#39;ll make us happy. All that will do is make you sad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Nate said slowly, just as the shower cut off upstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being careful will still stand,&quot; William told him, &quot;don&#39;t force yourself on a normal if they don&#39;t want to be transformed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we would like to meet your lover,&quot; Martha added.</p>
