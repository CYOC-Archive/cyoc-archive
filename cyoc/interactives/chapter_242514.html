<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer woke up as the door to her room exploded open. Her eyes quickly adjusted as she was rocked with the feeling of her piss. Her vagina was completely numb from the sensation now. Jennifer groaned as she looked at the doctor gleaming in the morning light. &quot;Ah good day Jennifer, are zou ready for the treatment&quot; he snapped his gloves with a devilish smile. <br />
<br />
Jennifer eyes opened with horror, but Dr. Lunatic paid her no mind. Stepping up he poked her in a few places. &quot;Yes yes.&quot; &quot;Oh my.&quot; &quot;Ah, glorious!&quot; He shouted and giggled to himself as he walked around her. &quot;Firstly, let&#39;s get you mobile again yes? Then, we can work on the solution for your flagrant urination hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Lunatic shouted so nearly half the hospital no doubt could hear him. &quot;FETCH ME.....THE JACKHAMMER!&quot; Jennifer looked around frantically, what the fuck what the FUCK she screamed in her head.<br />
<br />
The doctor cackled as he lifted up a large device, just like a jackhammer except with a large dildo at the end. &quot;The other doktors always prattle on about the gental method, but I say, no better way to cure a statue than to BREAK IT!&quot; Lunatic laughed as the dildo inserted into Jennifer&#39;s ass as she tried to scream, feeling the sudden rough vibrations course through her it was as if her pelvis, no actually every bone in her body, was exploding. Jennifer could both feel and hear her joints forcibly popping and cracking as he continued to drill. Jennifer first felt her legs come free, as they fell limply onto Lunatics shoulders. His face now taking the brunt of Jennifer&#39;s fountain, his goggles there for a reason after all. Then her back as she folded back. <br />
<br />
Lunatic stepped off the bed with a twisted smile. &quot;See? Perfect!&quot; Jennifer slowly raised her arm, it was still like moving a boulder, but she could actually move again. &quot;Hmfnm?&quot; Jennifer tried to move her jaw but just like her hand it was still extremely stiff. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shush shush, my girl, that was only step one, you will need many more sessions before you can move freely once again!&quot; Now then, let us see about your.....hmm&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Lunatics pursed his lips. &quot;This serum will slow down your flow, it will, eh, maybe, buy you another day until it&#39;s constant once again.&quot; He shrugged as he pulled out a comically oversized needle. &quot;Also this vil hurt, alot.&quot; He snickered as he quickly jammed the shot into Jennifer&#39;s arm. She couldn&#39;t move it fast enough, the serum shooting through her as the pee went from shooting onto the windows glass, to dumping onto the floor, to just dripping all over the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, usually it stops, but a reduced flow should be acceptable for now. How odd?&quot; Dr. Lunatic rubbed his chin. &quot;Well, anyways, more mysteries for me! I will check on you in another hour yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor twirled back around as he left. &quot;I have been.....DR. LUNATIC!&quot; he shouted as he then quickly left the room.<br />
<br />
A few hours passed, Jennifer was still too weak to move as the Nurse entered again with a tray of food. &quot;Who&#39;s ready for lunch?&quot; she said charmingly. The nurse treated her like a baby, needing to feed her. &quot;This is yummy apple sauce!&quot; the nurse said as she jammed the spoon into Jennifer&#39;s tight jaw. It didn&#39;t taste the best, but she was actually glad to be eating something after all of this. <br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s stomach curled as she moaned. The nurse rolled backwards in her stool as Jennifer moaned again but louder. Jennifers breathing grew heavier as she turned her head up. A sharp pressure tore through her chest and her groin. Thinking something had gone wrong with the the treatment she turned her head down again to see if she had begun to pee at full force, only to see something far more worse.<br />
<br />
Her breasts were growing, massively and in quickened, uncanny surges. One cup, then two, now three. Jennifer&#39;s bust continued to shoot out as the familiar burning sensation reappeared. Jennifer looked down, following the feeling only to look in even more horror as it spread to her pussy, her mound started to appear rising. &quot;NO NO NO! Jennifer managed to yelp out of her frozen mouth as she could feel her labia surge, rubbing down her upper thigh. Her breasts continued to surge outward, she couldn&#39;t even think of a cup size they would be anymore, nearly the size of a beach ball. Her condition still in effect as her breasts were too stiff to flatten, causing them to jut out perfectly, blocking alot of her lower vision. <br />
<br />
The nurse ran out of the room. After a minute, the growth seemingly stopped. Jennifer looked around the room, her vision yet again severely limited. <br />
<br />
The door cracked open again, the obvious voice of the Doctor reappeared. &quot;Tsk tsk tsk, vat is this?&quot; He appeared by Jennifer&#39;s side. &quot;I am afraid there have been a complication.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer rolled her eyes. &quot;No thith.&quot; she struggled to say. She closed her eyes in a sudden pang as she could feel her breasts and pussy expand another inch. <br />
<br />
&quot;You mustn&#39;t worry girl, I am afraid you have hypermastiogenitalia! It is a simple disease, often coupled with stress and an activator. You must have triggered it from the applesauce.&quot; The doctor grinned. &quot;It&#39;s reacts with your hormones, the more stressed you become, the faster it, and well, you, will grow.&quot; <br />
<br />
The doctor disappeared behind one of Jennifer&#39;s breasts. &quot;And zis? How lucky am I to have not one, but two rare conditions to grace me this week, and on the same patient no less!&quot; he exclaimed as he grabbed Jennifer&#39;s pussy. Jennifer yelped in surprise as she could easily feel both hands cup her labia. Just how big was it? Jennifer shuddered as the feeling returned again as she could feel her pussy grind further down her inner thigh, she could even feel it touch the damp cool sheets below.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said not to vorry my girl. If you get too big the treatments won&#39;t be as effective.&quot; Treatments? What about a damn cure? Jennifer screamed in her head, her breasts surging again as she felt her pussy how clearly hit the sheets. <br />
<br />
&quot;We will incorporate this into your routine,  it should be fine, I will let ze nurse know to begin preparations IMMEDIATELY!&quot; Jennifer could hear the doctor quickly leave the room. <br />
<br />
Jennifer breathed heavily as she slowly and deliberately moved her arm around her massive breasts down to her stomach the to her groin. Her mound felt huge, slipping down she gasped as she felt her vagina, her lips were as large as her hand almost. She would have given the worse camel toe imaginable if she tried to wear.....well...anything. Jennifer continued further below, her clit was so large she could pretty much hold it in her hand, it&#39;s sensitivity was crazy too, as Jennifer buckled her toes at the slightest touch as she moaned. The constant leaking increased slightly at the orgasm, like a dam cracking from the pressure, the trickle became yet again a stream, and it felt much larger than before, as if someone was just tipping a bottomless bucket right between her legs. She tried to push her legs together, only for her large pussy to squish up instead, far too large, she had the worst technically correct thigh gap known to man. Jennifer shuddered, if this hypermamiga-something increased how much she was going now, what would happen when the medicine wore off? Jennifer whined as she hoped they would just cure her soon. Her breasts and pussy growing yet another inch.</p>
