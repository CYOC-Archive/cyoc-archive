<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mister M enjoyed his work running the gym at the Dino Dome in Dino City, as it was something that gave him work to do and provide for a &quot;show of strength&quot; that not even most other Animalians could match. A lot of the training sessions, particularly with those like Jeremy or Rex who had jobs that kept them busy during the day, were often in the evening or at night, but there were some that were during the day and even some of the Humans from Glen Rose came in, as it seemed that similar to Lyre&#39;s situation with the Claw Coliseum in Animalia, Dino City actually created some encouragement that got people wanting to be in shape.<br />
<br />
Of course, some of it was either some sense of jealous at the health that Animalians tended to have or because of how often many Humans, even those that swore they weren&#39;t interested, were interested in their Animalian neighbors. Mister M often noted that a couple of the Human women that had their classes and workout sessions with him often spent some time looking to him and having some soft whispers between them. It was something that raised a chuckle as not all of them were &quot;young&quot; women that one would expect to be that driven or interested, and while his hearing wasn&#39;t sharp enough to know exactly what was said, he picked up enough to know that there was interest that went beyond getting healthy. At times he even flexed and gave the encouragement that &quot;this could all be yours.&quot; The comments often continued.<br />
<br />
This also had the Carcharodontosaurus Dinotopian even chuckled at some of the other developments that that had brought with it as Dino City&#39;s Dinotopian population increased. Some of it was a result of how many Humans ultimately displayed that they had sex drives just as much as Animalians did, even if there were cases where there were denials of this. It was something where businesses like the Meat Market did fairly well in Lyre and where some colonies had an &quot;adults only&quot; area that would allow for nudity and thus raised the potential of seeing a naked Animalian there. Many of them were more set up with regions for privacy and often were used more by honeymooning Animalian couples, but that didn&#39;t change the base attractions that were there. And some people often did bring that as an idea to Dino City as well. Some of the developments there got Mister M rather amused and presently had him on a teleconference call with some old friends of his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking good and tough, man,&quot; one chuckled, &quot;and possibly bigger than before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m the biggest male Theropod Dinotopian in Dino City,&quot; Mister M answered with a toothy smile, &quot;complete with all its perks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t they have a few T Rexes there?&quot; another old friend asked as he pushed his reading glasses up to better look through them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have two male and one female,&quot; Mister M answered, &quot;though it&#39;s the female that&#39;s closer to me in size... at least in terms of height and weight. The one male that might be about as strong as me is working for the town&#39;s police force under &quot;Sargeant Slash&quot; and the other... well... he&#39;s a nice and smart guy, but I think his focus is more on the scientific study of the actual animals than getting all bulked up. Though he did tell me that Carcharodontosaurus IS bigger than Tyrannosaurus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you got all the ladies attention!&quot; a third laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;A fair number,&quot; Mister M chuckled, &quot;though, I think most of the ladies that end up coming for my classes end up ogling the Sauropod males more... as they&#39;re obviously going to be bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously,&quot; the third chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how&#39;s gone all the debates over &quot;other&quot; things?&quot; the first asked, &quot;yah know... all the guys that want to create a version of Animalia&#39;s &quot;Meat Market&quot; in Dino City.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s actually a bit of a mess,&quot; Mister M commented, &quot;largely because how a lot of things go on here... likely a lot of it being the influence coming out of some in Glen Rose that have wanted to use some of the trackways at the fossil site in the state park it&#39;s next to as proof of creationism and so on. In that they don&#39;t want the &quot;porn industry,&quot; even if they recognize that local residents... including local Humans probably wouldn&#39;t mind too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was something of a major issue, in that the first Dino City government was largely made up of only the Glen Rose residents that were transferred from Glen Rose to Dino City and all of them were Human at the time. They then passed local regulations against things like the Meat Market being present in Dino City for fear of assorted troubles that came along with the industry. There was no ban on buying porn or anything from that nature for &quot;private&quot; viewing or reading, they just didn&#39;t want the problems that came with it coming in. There also technically wasn&#39;t any regulation that would have forbid those that had worked in the Meat Market, like Tyra or Andrew, looking for similar work in a different city/location. Representatives from the Meat Market sent made their arguments and took them Dino City&#39;s major, who had by this time become a male Parasaurolophus Dinotopian, only to learn that he didn&#39;t have the ability to annul or repeal the ordinances passed before his conversion.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bunch of old prudes, if you ask me,&quot; the second commented, &quot;it may not be the most common job or something that may be &quot;normal,&quot; but it can be fun, and no one has said everyone has to go into a strip club.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe the concern was more over having to deal with drunken customers,&quot; Mister M said slowly, &quot;and that Lyre saw the number of public intoxication cases increase after the Meat Market opened, and not all of them were tourists.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all-personal choices, though,&quot; the third pointed out, &quot;something I though all these conservative Republicans all argue for... PERSONAL RESONSIBILITY.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That all depends on the issue,&quot; the first commented, &quot;though I think there actually was a resolution to the present issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mister M nodded to that last part, as that &quot;resolution&quot; was a part of the reason for the call he was making. In some ways it didn&#39;t change much, as the agreement and amendments the City Council agreed to wouldn&#39;t allow for something like the Meat Market to be set up IN Dino City, but it did allow for things that would relate to selling print or &quot;video&quot; material more easily as well as even offering for a means to allow for more open recognition that travel would be allowed. Mister M wasn&#39;t quite sure as to the quality of the negotiators that the Meat Market sent to Dino City, but technically they&#39;d only persuaded the Dino City city council to essentially heavily integrate what was already allowed rather than truly changing any other policy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically the resolution doesn&#39;t change much,&quot; Mister M commented, &quot;at best with anything IN Dino City would be limited to something shot in the privacy of one&#39;s own home and sold online, which technically was allowed before, but not much more than that. The rest is going to be more on open statements for the sale of printed and video material, shot outside Dino City, with the only regulation obviously relating to the age of the subject and the age of who can buy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In other words, the same regulations as everywhere else,&quot; the second commented, &quot;that doesn&#39;t sound like much of a &quot;resolution&quot; if what they&#39;ve been talked into was technically something they already agreed to tolerate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s probably more of an assurance that things won&#39;t go further,&quot; Mister M commented, &quot;I don&#39;t think that there truly was something that was going to happen, but it must have been the prime concern and even with what is there... there could be plenty of opportunities. Possibly like gaining some attention beyond &quot;work,&quot; if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get all the ladies to look to you to look to us?&quot; the third asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It could work,&quot; Mister M answered, &quot;though, I&#39;m still working out a way to make &quot;a&quot; move without embarrassing them or myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might have to come in and visit just to see that,&quot; the first gave a hearty laugh.</p>
