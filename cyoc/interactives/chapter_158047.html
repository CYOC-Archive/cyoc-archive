<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night is nothing but pain and the annoying itch in my groin. The armor was cool but holy fuck the moisture down there is enough to grow mushrooms. I’d like to remove it but without Carim to untie the knots, my fate is sealed down there. Carim and Aylwin went to a nearby holdfast for the night. The place is crawling with Arslan’s sympathizers so they decided to stay here with the horses and wares.<br />
<br />
With nothing to do, I decided to stoke out the flame and go to sleep in my armor. It’s clunky and a hard thing to sleep on. Clinks and thuds of metal are made when I tried to adjust my sleep position. Then suddenly, I feel a hand caress my face with the other unbuckling my armor. It was a lengthy hand, not of Carim and neither from Aylwin. Carim’s hand is strong and calloused while Aylwin’s are soft with that female warrior’s face. This hand is different, smooth yet I could feel something hard scraping off my skin. I traced through my lips and opened my mouth, inspecting the pearly whites underneath. The hard thing scratched my lip and nipped off a bit of skin, making my lip bleed a little. Fingernail doesn’t do that. I’m sure of it. Unless it was something sharper. Like a claw. Wait, humans don’t have claws.<br />
<br />
I opened my eyes to see an infernal creature above me flapping his leathery wings. His complexion is otherworldly purple but his face is of this world. A young face with fierce thin eyes smiling upon my mortal body.<br />
<br />
“You’ll do fine,” He said before kissing me and sending me to a deep slumber.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
I woke to a crash of my cars outside my window. But when I went to look, there’s nothing outside except for my bright neighborhood with the morning sun on the horizon.<br />
<br />
“Waffle’s ready!” My mom said downstairs. I dashed downstairs to see that my younger brother has already taken his place in the table. His plate has three stacked waffles and a dollop of maple butter. He poured maple syrup over it but I realize that there’s something strange. The purple liquid isn’t that viscous. I shrugged my shoulders and grabbed my portion of the waffles. <br />
<br />
Weird. Maple syrup doesn’t taste salty.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
I always reach school earlier than the prescribed hours. In that waiting time, I usually do my unfinished assignments and sort out my notes. If all of that is done, I’d sit by the Maple tree at the back of the Gymnasium where I’ll wait for the beautiful sight of my morning routine.<br />
<br />
There he goes. Jason Finch. Soccer star and all-out winner of our campus. He’s talking to Tay Bans, whom I assumed to be his girlfriend but actually, she’s not. Jason bid her goodbye before walking towards my direction. He always visits the gymnasium every morning to check in with the coach and with me in this spot, it’s a guarantee that I always meet him.<br />
<br />
But no. There’s something wrong. Jason’s eyes are different. The kind-looking eyes are replaced with something sinister. Something fierce. <br />
<br />
And Jason doesn’t have broken horns in his forehead. Does he? Anyway, I go to him and said hi. We did our usual brofist and finished it with a chest bump. He’s bigger so I’m always bound to fall on the grass. But this time, he did something different. He caught me with his arms and he latched me closer. Our faces are practically at blank point range with each other. One lean and my nose would touch his.<br />
<br />
“Whoa,” He said with a smirk. “Be careful.”<br />
<br />
I giggled and tried to hide my blushing face. Then suddenly, I remember something. “Jason, did you do Mrs. Huffington’s online quiz?”<br />
<br />
“Awl Line Cheese?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you,” I pat shamefully flicked my hand in the air like a pristine 18th-century victorian virgin maid. “The Math quiz online. I thought I reminded you yesterday.”<br />
<br />
“Yes! You… umm… reminded me. But I guess I forgot.” He chuckled nervously.<br />
<br />
“We still have three more hours before class starts. Want me to help you out?”<br />
<br />
He smiled devilishly. “Sure. Lead the way.”<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Thankfully, the computer room is desolate except for Mr. Walters. He’s a good guy. Well, half a guy since he’s bisexual like me. I approached him at his desk to notify him that we’ll use one of the computers. When he turned around, I was surprised to see someone different. He’s bulky and he’s wearing medieval clothing. There’s a sword behind his back with strange runes flittering in and out.<br />
<br />
“Jon! Good morning.”<br />
<br />
My name’s not Jon. Weird.<br />
<br />
“Computer three? Like usual?”<br />
<br />
How suspicious. He knows me as if he’s Mr. Walters. Is he, Mr. Walters? If he is, that is a damn good costume. The muscles look so real. I nodded at him and led Jason to my usual stall.<br />
<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Goodness, gracious. The boy wonder of the school is actually beside me and all I did is invite him to help him with his online quiz. I never got the chance to help him before since he’s diligent in doing Quizzes as much as I am. This new Jason is forgetful and doesn’t even know how to use a mouse. Who does that? <br />
<br />
“You click with the right and be sure that it’s above the program you want to open.” I touched his hand. Oh my god, I touched his hand. It’s smooth and buttery. My hands slid smoothly because of how baby-like his skin is. I helped him grab the mouse but in the process, he stumbled forward and pushing ourselves to the ground. He was on top of me and huffing. As if he just finished soccer practice.<br />
<br />
A flash.<br />
<br />
Jason’s still on top of me but he’s wearing different clothes. His soccer gear and it smells like he’s been practicing all day long. He fell on top of me, slobbering me with his musky aroma. I seriously don’t want this moment to end. He’s huffing, probably tired from running all day, and there’s a tight feeling in my groin. Fuck! I’m getting hard. I prayed by the gods, old and the new, for him not to notice it. But in the process, I noticed another thing hardening up above my legs. I looked down and saw that Jason doesn’t have clothes anymore. And so am I! He’s hard and by the gods, he’s fucking hung.<br />
<br />
“You like what you see?” He smiled with a fang poking out. He’s more violet than before and his horns are growing longer by the second.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Jason.” <br />
<br />
“You can grab it if you want”<br />
<br />
YES! That is truly what I want. I grabbed the lengthy member in my palm, feeling its weight pulling it down and gave it a hearty squeeze. I pulled the shaft, letting the foreskin peel back and showing his head. Without hesitation, my head reached for his tip and gave it a little lick. Something throbbed inside me. An innate power whispered in my head and it crawled in my skin compelling me to reach beyond. It’s not libido, rather, a power beyond my current understanding. The whisper was a path to powers that surprised both of us.<br />
<br />
I focused on my skin and the throbbing member in front of me. A hole only I could see appeared between the two of us. I entered the hole and I found myself getting smaller and getting sucked inside Jason’s dick. My body couldn’t fit inside with brisk movements but when I squirm tightly like a worm, I worked myself inside. <br />
<br />
“What in hell’s bliss is happening!?” Jason cursed. I could hear him panting in pain and confusion in the dark innards if his body. Wet flesh wrapped around me, absorbing me further inside and filling every niche of my naked body with slick clear fluids. I crawled deeper and deeper until I found three holes in front of me. They are holes but to make it more specific, they’re face holes. I laid my face in the spot and when I blinked, I found myself outside again. Overwhelming pain is prickling the slit of my cock. It’s stretched wide open but it’s slowly fitting itself back in. <br />
<br />
I remember now. I remember the power that called to me that very day. The power of possession. The power to possess bodies like what I’m doing right now. Jason’s body is my body and his every movement is mine. His dick is mine. Its length is mine. His Girth is mine. And all the pleasure on my flesh is mine.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, I feel strange energy brimming in my chest. My pecs turned a darker shade of violet. Like the maple syrup I’ve seen this morning, a warm viscous liquid began excreting out of my nipples. It filled me with a sensation I haven’t imagined before. It’s like masturbating times two and in your chest. I squeezed the contents out of my pink nipples and pooled the liquid to the floor.<br />
<br />
From the puddle, a reflection of a man with fierce yellow eyes emerged. Ripples from the center vibrated and from the liquid, out came a demon with leathery wings and two black horns. His scowl scared me but his face made my dick even harder. He’s no Jason Finch but he’s handsome and brusque nonetheless.<br />
<br />
“I’ve played your strange dreams, human. What you did is not only offending but fucking painful! I want more.” He lunged at me with tongue-wet lip and slobbered his mouth all over my phallus. This body is so hung that the extra flesh in my member is sending more signals of pleasure than what I’m used to. I need more. I need more length than this. The demon played my dick like a fiddle and he’s damn fucking good. His tongue danced, circled and prodded in a feisty tango that so earthy shattering that I dug my hands on the floor just to hold that pressure in. <br />
<br />
Fucking hell this body is so sensitive!<br />
<br />
I want more! I grabbed the demon by the neck and pushed his living brains out deeper into my member. It took him by a surprise but he welcomed it all the same. He sucked me like no man has ever done or will be done. It feels like he has ten sets of tongues inside that mouth of his.<br />
<br />
He took a breath of air and smiled at me. <br />
<br />
“This night wasn’t a waste after all,”<br />
<br />
I called upon Mr. Walters who was just standing there the whole time with a blank stare in his eyes. With Jason’s strength, I pulled down his leather shin guard, flaying his dick for all to see. He has a bigger dick than mine and my desire for it is so overflowing that I began to feel a new power inside me. Tentacles! I don’t know how the fuck did I reach such a conclusion but tentacles seemed like the best solution to get the cock. <br />
<br />
My hands turned into a mass of slithery monstrosities and wrapped it around Mr. Walter’s dick. It devoured said dick to its basic components and gave it to my own length. While the demon is still working his way with my dick, I could see my flesh growing beyond the boundaries of his lips. It filled him with way more flesh that could fit inside his mouth. The demon opened his eyes to see what was happening and saw me absorbing my mentor’s length and girth.<br />
<br />
“At this point, I’m going to let you do the dream.”<br />
<br />
The world changed around us and sent us to a landscape with black leather floors and a sunny sky above us. The air smelled like Jason’s cologne. Around us are the males I’ve seen before in my life. There’s Aylwin, the face stealing monster wearing the shepherd’s face and beside him is Arthur Demagogue. They’re both naked with a blank stare like Mr. Walters who I now recognize as Carim. The three of them would be sexy if they fucked each other.<br />
<br />
And holy fuck they did. Arthur grabbed Aylwin by the legs and spread him apart. He slid his dick with force and pegged him raw. Carim followed soon after with his shrunk up dick that looks like it belongs to an adolescent boy. He squeezed beside Arthur and inserted themselves deeper into Aylwin’s tight ass. <br />
<br />
I called upon the demon to follow me and help the two large men penetrate the younger lad. The demon was able to lend another dick and spread Aylwin’s ass larger. But their collective dick could not compare to what I have right now. I set them aside, grabbed Aylwin by the torso (which I did so easily because of my strength) and fucked him like a blow-up sex doll. I carried him up and pulled him down repeatedly, feeling the walls of his ass open further and further for my dick. His wet innards squeezed my dick out and dampened any throbbing sensation it felt. I fucked him repeatedly and at that time, I forgot the demon who made this all real.<br />
<br />
“Don’t leave me out human!”<br />
<br />
The demon flew in the air and invaded Aylwin’s body from the hole in his belly button. His stomach enlarged to sizes comparable to a pregnant woman. Aylwin’s face winced in pain but it suddenly turned into a fiery look begging for more intimacy.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me! Fuck me!” The demon said with Aylwin’s voice as he squeezed his ass wider with his hands. “Fuck me!”<br />
<br />
I hastened my speed this time. Faster, deeper and more rigorous motions where I didn’t care if I hurt the demon or not. At that time, I grabbed Arthur’s family marbles and licked it like how I lick a jawbreaker. I nipped it with my lips and nibbled on his meat-tasting member. The taste is all so yummy that the deeper I go into Aylwin, the deeper Arthur’s dick traveled down my throat.<br />
<br />
Carim wasn’t left behind as he tried to get himself behind me and fuck me from behind. What’s left of his dick is mediocre but the performance I imagined made up for it. In this heat of fucking and sucking, I forgot how sensitive Jason’s body is. When Carim inserted his member inside my ass, a prickling strike coursed through my spine and sending me forward and deeper into Aylwin. He thrust once more and he hit my prostrate. So that’s how it feels like. And fuck! Hit me another! And Another! And another!<br />
<br />
I went deeper into Aylwin and at the same time, two other men are getting their fair share of depth.<br />
<br />
I could feel it. The penultimate sensation that preceded the rocking my world. I could feel it coming. My neck craned as I tried to contain the pressure building up from the base of my balls. I grit my teeth but the pressure is getting stronger and stronger the more I fucked the boy in front of me. But like the Apollo II spacecraft, everything great could explode in extraordinary ways. My warm slick seed gushed forth like a power washer. It filled Aylwin’s ass with every drop of semen drained from my balls. At the same time, Arthur and Carim flushed their own seed in the bowels of my ass and mouth. Arthur filled me with an earthy taste that of which I swallowed every drop. Carim covered my insides with warmth and tender loving care with I used to kiss him in the mouth. He didn’t care when Arthur’s semen touched his lips. Rather, he was fond of it. His tongue invaded mine and licked the niche of my teeth while coiling around my tongue in-between moments.<br />
<br />
Then suddenly, I was back in the forest. My dick is hard, throbbing and wet with semen. My face is wet with tears and blood. I looked around and saw Carim with his flaming sword activated in his hands. <br />
<br />
“Wh- what happened?” I asked. One moment, Carim and I were kissing while I’m fucking Aylwin’s possessed body, the other I’m in a forest with a beheaded creature in front of me. Its blood put out the flames and the only source of light is the torch in Aylwin’s hand.<br />
<br />
“A succubus sucked your energy,” Carim replied.<br />
<br />
“And by energy, he meant your dick.”<br />
<br />
I looked down at my groin and there it was, a head of a handsome succubus wrapped around the shaft of my dick.</p>
