<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy&#39;s existential crisis was suddenly disturbed by the guy groaning as he stretched out his athletically built body--which wasn&#39;t that hard on the eyes, even if he had left a bucket full of semen all over her nether regions--and slowly opened his green eyes--which looked both familiar and unfamiliar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, I must have partied too hard last night to get this killer headache,&quot; mumbled Matt as he rubbed his temples and eyes with his palms. His fraternity&#39;s brothers had really gone all out for a graduation party last night. His last night before he&#39;d graduate then hello LA and a film career. He then opened and locked eyes with a very clearly pretty co-ed with decent sized tits and a bit of a belly--but in a tight kind of way that was kinda hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you look familiar to me, and yet I feel like I&#39;ve never seen you before in my life?&quot; asked Matt.<br />
<br />
Amy took a deep breath and stood up and handed Matt the video camera. It took Matt a few seconds, but he found the play button and he watched as what could only be described as an older brother who looked a decade or more older than him fucked what looked to be this pretty coed&#39;s older sister... first in a field, then in a bus... and then suddenly they were in this room--in this very set up and he heard conversation on film:<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem. As I was saying. I am but a mere spirit, unmanifested guardian so to speak to fulfill your desires.&quot; said a disembodied voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. So make me and my wife 20-year-olds thanks.&quot; said the old man while flicking his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can fulfill that kind of a wish. You either have to express if you want to--.&quot; The voice responded back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop the video!&quot; yelled Amy over the recording and after a bit of fumbling Matt obliged.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say those words, the room responds,&quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What words?&quot; asked Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Progress or Regress,&quot; answered the disembodied voice from all around them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit... is this some kind of prank show? Am I on Punked?&quot; asked Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Play the video, but put it on mute,&quot; suggested Amy.<br />
<br />
Matt, deciding he&#39;d continue to go along with all of this, obliged the girl and watched only to see the older couple slowly begin to get... younger and turn into them?! Definitely a prank show.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool special effects, did you do it in Adobe Premire? Where are the other cameras?&quot; said Matt, trying to laugh it off. The girl however wasn&#39;t laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are no other cameras. I am the Age Room, where you can either Regress or Progress to whatever age the three of you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three of us? Even in the video there were only two of us who came in,&quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;And because you progressed after engaging in intercourse, you&#39;ve both brought a third life into being,&quot; said the voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pregnant... you got me pregnant!&quot; said Amy as she started to hit Matt, who put up his arms to deflect her rather vigorous attack before she crumpled in on herself and began to cry on the floor, leaving Matt not knowing what to do. A prank show would have ended this a while ago, that meant that this all might be... real. Shit. Matt bent down and tried to assuage Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... hey... I&#39;m sorry, but if it&#39;s any consolation... it seems like we got married... in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Married... to a pervert who can&#39;t help but film us having sex in random places!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pervert?! Look, you seemed to be enjoying it as much as I did--will--do in that video. And you were the one in the camera frame when it first turned on with me in the back corner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m supposed to graduate and become a doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m heading off to LA tomorrow to make it big in Hollywood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clearly our lives didn&#39;t turn out the way we wanted them to... if we&#39;re making cheap sex tapes,&quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... what if we decided to do something different?&quot; asked Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm... spirit or whatever you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Regress or Progress?&quot; asked the voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would happen if we walked out of this room like we are, right now?&quot; asked Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then reality would become fixed to accommodate for your new ages and conditions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... so essentially a second chance to start things fresh?&quot; asked Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps, depending on what choices you made this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, so, we know for a fact we didn&#39;t come in with you pregnant--do you still want to keep carrying it around for the next six months I&#39;m guessing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five months, fifteen days, seven hours, two minutes and thirty-six seconds,&quot; corrected the voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we can make it so that she&#39;s not pregnant, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We just have to... get a few months younger, right?&quot; asked Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, if you don&#39;t mind, I say we--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to keep it,&quot; said Amy suddenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know why... but something inside me is desperate to keep this baby,&quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps... in that future you really wanted a baby, and that&#39;s why all the sex?&quot; suggested Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don&#39;t want to carry it either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we could always get a little older by a few months and pop the baby out of you--&quot; said Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Progress a month a minute,&quot; said Amy without letting Matt finish. And Matt watched as Amy&#39;s curvy body grew even more so. She looked absolutely radiant and so... hot. His penis had no trouble showing his thoughts on the matter. As Amy grew larger, she had trouble keeping herself up, so Matt immediately positioned himself behind her to let her lean on him and his boner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep that thing in check. I don&#39;t want to end up with more than one,&quot; said Amy as her belly and breasts swelled even larger yet again as she entered her third trimester and was growing sore and a bit grouchy. At this point a strange tingle on their fingers occurred with wedding rings appearing on Amy and Matt&#39;s fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess that makes it official,&quot; whispered Matt into Amy&#39;s ear, who was feeling far more comfortable with him now.<br />
<br />
One moment Amy was looking beyond fully nine months pregnant, the next instant two squalling infants were resting on her somewhat deflated belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop!&quot; yelled both Amy and Matt simultaneously. The babies continued to squall and Amy maneuvered the twins--one a boy and the other a girl into each of her arms, who then pawed at her breasts until they latched on. Looking at her two children, Amy felt a wave of different feelings and emotions wash over her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we got more than one even with me keeping myself in check,&quot; joked Matt, and Amy gave a little laugh before turning her head to look Matt directly in the eyes. He no longer seemed as fresh-faced as he had a few minutes ago. Now he looked tired with rings under his eyes and a bit of stubble on his chin that still managed to make him look handsome despite looking tired.<br />
<br />
&quot;What shall we name them?&quot; asked Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I dunno... I never put that much thought into it,&quot; admitted Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean to say in the last three months we&#39;ve been married and prepping for them to come you didn&#39;t once think of what we&#39;d like to call them?&quot; asked Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s been more three minutes than three months given this room, but truth be told, I wanted to hear what you thought, first,&quot; said Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s sweet, but frankly... well, actually that&#39;s not that bad of a name. What about Frank for the boy?&quot; asked Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;As short for Francis or Franklin?&quot; asked Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like Franklin better, truth be told,&quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so this little guy is Franklin Thomas Reece.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You pick our daughter&#39;s name then,&quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isolde,&quot; said Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;That came quickly for someone who hasn&#39;t been thinking about it. Why Isolde?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can call her Izzy for short, but it&#39;s from an old legend that got turned into a movie that I really remember liking a lot. And it&#39;s not something too common like Megan, Jennifer, Olivia, or Emma. It&#39;s something that can just be hers and hers alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, so this little girl shall be Isolde Lillian Reece, then,&quot; said Amy.</p>
