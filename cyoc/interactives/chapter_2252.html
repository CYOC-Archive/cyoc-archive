<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Coach was a little slow getting to the showers this afternoon.  Practice had been rougher than usual, and it took him longer to put stuff away.  He could have asked Laird to do it, but the kids wanted to hit the showers and go home, so he stayed on the field a few extra minutes.  Coming into the office, he saw Matt working at the desk as usual, and the team was mostly finished with their showers.
<br />

<br />
Coach pulled off his shirt and sat down in the chair, watching as Matt seemed to be doing the stats a little slower now that his hairy chest was exposed.  Coach knew what was up.  Matt wasn't the first gay kid he'd had involved with the team over the years.  Bending over to untie his shoes, Coach knew he was being watched and while he wasn't gay, he did like the attention.  He had always had a great body, and he knew it.  Guys and girls both wanted a piece of his ass.  Kicking off his shoes and socks, he stood up and yanked down his sweats.  Matt's pencil paused, but he didn't look up.  'Good kid,' Coach thought, quickly wrapping up in the towel so-as not to be indiscrete.  It was just a tease; he wouldn't be molesting anyone.
<br />

<br />
The kids were mostly out of the showers by the time he got started, but the showers were only separated from the rest of the locker room by a little half-wall, so he was able to keep an eye on everyone, should there be any discipline issues.  Some kids stole surreptitious glances, but he knew they didn't really mean anything by it.  Coach probably put on a little for them, taking a longer shower than he strictly needed, because the kids seemed to be looking a little longer today than usual.  He turned off the water and grabbed a towel, smiling at somebody and trying to think of something to say to break the tension.  Nothing came to mind, and in a second he was roughly drying off his head, face, and shoulders.
<br />

<br />
When he moved the towel down to his chest, he knew the kids were looking at him.  It was a lot more blatant than usual.  Coach was torn about this -- pleased at the attention, but a little concerned because this was so unusual.  Quickly, he bent over and dried off his legs, crotch and butt.  He gave them a little extra time to look away before straightening up to see if they were still watching him.
<br />

<br />
Now they weren't just looking at him, they were staring at him.  Most of the kids had left for the day, but three or four of the guys were a little slow getting dressed and now they were all looking right at him.  Coach wrapped the towel around his waist and noticed that it was bigger than the usual gym towels, but didn't really pay that any mind.  Covered up, he said, &quot;What?!&quot; to no one in particular.  While he loved the boys' attention, he didn't like the freak-show aspect of being stared at.  All the same, he felt his dick starting to inflate.
<br />

<br />
One of the boys came towards the half-wall and asked, &quot;Coach, are you feeling OK?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Coach felt the towel loosening around his waist.  The damn thing was loosening already!  His cock was starting to bulge out against it, which was embarassing and exciting at the same time.  He cinched the towel up tighter.  &quot;Yeah, I feel fine!&quot; he said.  &quot;Now get out of here before I punch your face in for staring at me.&quot;  He looked over at the other three kids, &quot;You too.  All of you.&quot;
<br />

<br />
They backed down quickly, and in ten seconds they had cleared out, although as he left, the quarterback seemed a good sight taller than he should have been.  Coach had turned his back on them as they left the room, freeing his fully-hard boner from the towel and trying to wrap up again.  He wasn't sure what to do about Matt.  Maybe their relationship could be improved by a confrontation on the whole &quot;gay&quot; thing.
<br />

<br />
Turning around again, Coach walked quickly back to the office.  On his way, he noticed that the half-wall also seemed much too tall.  In fact, the benches were higher as he passed them.  What was going on?  Was this some kind of trick?  And what was with his cock all of a sudden?
<br />

<br />
He turned the corner into the office where Matt was still working and saw his team manager seemed to fill a lot more of the office than before.  In fact, the whole room seemed wonky somehow.  He was starting to feel a little light-headed as he could feel blood rushing into his head.  The towel was slipping -- again!  He could hear his heart beating in his ears, and feel his boner throb with each pulse.
<br />

<br />
Turning his back to Matt, he tossed the cursed towel aside and yanked the bag with his clean clothes out from under the chair.  It felt too heavy, but he also felt the hot flesh of his rod push up against his furry belly when he bent over.  Unthinking, he used one hand to rub the tip while unzipping his bag with the other.  Rummaging around for a moment, he pulled out his underwear, keeping one hand on his prick at all times.
<br />

<br />
He held his underwear up in front of his face and knew immediately that they would never fit.  They were WAY too big.  Not a few sizes too big, but inches and inches of extra material.  He looked down at his bag and saw his dick standing at attention.  What was going on, and why was he so fucking horny?  He tossed the underwear on the chair.  Wrapping his erection up in his fist, he started gently stroking it while he bent over to retrieve a sock from the bag.  It was also way too big -- more like a christmas stocking than something he'd wear.
<br />

<br />
Why were all his clothes so big?  He was jacking off at full speed now.  He looked at the chair, and it seemed big now too.  The bag seemed too big.  He turned slowly around the room -- EVERYTHING seemed too big... everything except him.  He realized he was shrinking, and while that was definitely something he needed to deal with, his sex just seemed so much more urgent right now.  Turning around now, he noticed that Matt was no longer at the desk.  With a click, he heard the office door close.  Quickly turning the rest of the way, jacking off at full steam, he turned to see Matt as a giant standing at the door.</p>
