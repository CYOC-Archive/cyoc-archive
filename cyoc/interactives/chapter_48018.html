<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Horst and Carter hounded Vinnie all day.  It seemed that one or both of them were in each of his remaining classes. It sort of made sense as they were all seniors. At last the final bell rang, and Vinnie was ready to go home.  Ryan was more trouble than he was worth, he was tempted just to take the jock off in the restroom and dump him in a trash can. But that would be like murdering him, of course, what was turning him into a jockstrap like. <br />
<br />
Maybe it would teach Ryan a lesson. Vinnie fingered his medallion as he contemplated how he had done this to Ryan and how he might be able to undo it. He thought as he walked. He didn't have long to contemplate.  Carter had been in Vinnie's last class, and had been asked by the teacher to stay to discuss something, but his other shadow showed up breathing hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's a long way from shop class to the flag pole,&quot; Horst said.<br />
<br />
A moment later, Carter showed up, &quot;Hey, Vinnie, why didn'tcha wait?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen guys, about Ryan...&quot; Vinnie began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know you're teaching him a lesson. Fine. He can be a big jerk sometimes. We gotcha. But he's our bud, and we're sorry for what we done to ya. So how about we have a pizza party. Our treat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinnie thought it might be an earnest act of goodwill, and maybe things would be better after all this. He said yes.  He had no idea that when Ryan, Carter and Horst had a pizza party it meant a keg of beer for the three of them and six large pizzas.  But he did have a good time. He learned more about Ryan in vignettes told by Carter and Horst, and he got to know the two jocks better too. They really weren't so bad.<br />
<br />
It was close to midnight, when they staggered over to Ryan Standish's home. The TV was blaring, and there was a violent argument being shouted over the noise of the TV. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's just Ryan's pa and bro Dylan,&quot; explained Horst, &quot;We usually climb through the back window. You can leave Ryan in his bed, and then when he wakes up tomorrow. He'll think he just tied one on and had a really bad dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure, I'll leave the jock in his bed and he'll change back,&quot; Vinnie said but his mind added the words silently, I hope.<br />
 <br />
The three climbed through the back window and worked their way quietly down the hall to the third door on the left. Ryan's room was a pigsty. <br />
<br />
&quot;He shares it with his two older brothers,&quot; Horst explained by way of the crowded room with clothing everywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;But there's only one bed,&quot; Vinnie protested looking at the fullsized bed crammed in the corner. He was stripping down to take off his jock. He blushed when he realized he'd taken off his shirt and jacket too. Totally unnecessary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Ryan and his two big bros share it. I think they sleep in shifts or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a loud ruckus in the hallway. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, Dylan's coming. Quick hide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't we go out the window?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, it's nailed so it won't open more than six inches,&quot; Horst explained disappearing into the closet.<br />
<br />
Carter shoved Vinnie into the bed, grabbed Vinnie's clothing and slid under the bed. The doorknob turned, so Vinnie just pulled the covers over his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doofus, sleeping with the light on?&quot; said Dylan.  He punctuated his slurred speech with a belch. He was drunk. He turned off the light. Vinnie could hear clothing landing around the room as Dylan stripped.<br />
<br />
He climbed into bed. Vinnie felt the warm cock slap his butt and realized Dylan slept in the nude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scootch over, Ryan, we gotta make room for Paddie. They changed him to dayshift, so it's three on a mattress again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinnie swallowed hard and played that he was sound asleep.  He was smaller than Ryan, how couldn't his brother notice? Guess, he was really drunk, or maybe it was like that trick of the mirror earlier. Maybe the guy really saw Ryan instead of Vinnie lying next to him.<br />
<br />
As soon as he was asleep. Vinnie yawned.  He didn't normally drink beer, and realized he was pretty wasted himself. He dozed off.<br />
<br />
He woke when the third brother arrived in the room. The guy slammed the door and turned on the light. Vinnie almost sat up, but Dylan's muscled arm was lying across him. They had slept in the spooning position, but now Dylan's cock was rock hard. So was Vinnie's for that matter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sheesh, you guysh look gay. Well, move over, I can't believe they shanged my shift. Itsh punishment cause I got caught sleeping. You cansht sleep on the dayshift too many peoples. S'not fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
He tore off his clothes and flipped off the light.  The bed creaked under his added weight as Paddie joined them in bed. It must've been around 2 - just after the bars closed. Vinnie wondered about Horst and Carter.<br />
<br />
Carter discovered that when Dylan got in the bed, that the springs had sagged effectively trapping him under the bed.  He wasn't going anywhere until the bed was empty. Horst discovered that this was the closet that Ryan had been locked in as a kid. There was no handle on the inside.<br />
<br />
As Paddie shoved the two guys against the wall, Vinnie felt Dylan's hard cock wedge between his butt cheeks. Dylan started snoring, Vinnie hoped it wouldn't be a wet dream.  A few minutes later Paddie was snoring too. Then he started moving around in his sleep. Just what Vinnie needed a restless sleeper that weighed 250 lbs. It got worse. Paddie crawled on top of Vinnie and Dylan before he fell asleep. He was naked too, and his breath and skin reeked of alcohol.<br />
<br />
Lucky Ryan, thought Vinnie with a sudden pang of regret that Ryan had to go through this nightly. No wonder he was such a prick. Vinnie yawned and went back to sleep.</p>
