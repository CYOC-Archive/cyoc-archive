<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well at least now I don&#39;t have to worry about Ivanna&#39;s   birthday present. Now I have more time to get ready for the party. Ivanna really surprised me when she told me that her party was today ... Why didn&#39;t she say so in advance !!. If she wasn&#39;t a good friend of mine, I would have declined her invitation... Well, what&#39;s done is done. Now ... what should I wear ...<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Very funny Belle, but I won&#39;t fall for something like that, it&#39;s impossible for you to forget about me in such a short time ... right?&quot; It was the first thing that came to you mind, you knew that your sister&#39;s strength was not her memory, but it was ridiculous that she forgot you in such a short time.<br />
<br />
Belle spent a long time trying on a variety of dresses. Several hours later, she finished getting ready, so now she only needed to put the &quot;yoga pants&quot; in a gift bag.<br />
Belle picked you up from the bed and left her room.<br />
&quot;Mom, do you know where the gift bags are? I need one for Ivanna&#39;s gift!&quot; Belle said out loud for her mother to hear. You initially thought this was an annoying joke on your sister&#39;s part, but now you were starting to freak out.<br />
&quot;Yes, give me a moment and I&#39;ll take a few to your room ...&quot; Your mother replied back. Belle sat back on her bed and set you aside. A few minutes later, your mother came into Belle&#39;s room with several gift bags.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you so well dressed?&quot; Belle asked as soon as her mother entered the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well ... I had invited someone to dinner.&quot; Your mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So ... what do you plan to give Ivanna?&quot; Your mother said, quickly changing the subject, Belle simply pointed you out for your mother to see you.&quot;Yoga pants? When did you buy it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Belle thought for a moment to tell her the truth, but after thinking about it, she knew her mother would be mad if she told her it was an unused pair of pants she had in her drawer for some reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well ... I bought it in the morning. Do you like it?&quot; Belle replied. &quot;What? Belle, that&#39;s not true!&quot; You exclaimed in your mind when you heard that, after all you could not speak, the only thing you could do is hope that this was a joke or that at least if it wasn&#39;t, that your mother remembered you<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t look bad ... but for some reason I feel like I&#39;ve seen it before ...&quot; Your mother was silent for a moment, giving you a glimmer of hope, however, just as she was finishing saying something, the doorbell rang...<br />
&quot;Wait isn&#39;t this your...&quot; Ding-dong<br />
<br />
&quot;I think your date is here...&quot; Belle said after hearing the doorbell, quickly changing the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it can&#39;t be. I still haven&#39;t finished fixing my hair.&quot; Your mother panicked after hearing Belle<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. I already have what I need, so don&#39;t worry about me. My friends will be coming for me shortly. Go fix your hair fast, I&#39;ll tell him to wait in the living room&quot; Belle said<br />
<br />
&quot;O-okay Belle, take care.&quot; Your mother said as she ran to her room, completely forgetting what she was about to say.<br />
<br />
Belle greeted her mother&#39;s date and told him to wait for her in the living room for a bit. After that, she returned to the room and began to look at the options of bags that his mother had brought ...<br />
<br />
&quot;Not this one, not this one ... this one&quot; Belle said softly as she looked at the options. Then, she picked you up and placed you inside the bag she had chosen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just in time!&quot; Belle exclaimed to herself, the moment she said that, her phone rang. It was her friends telling her that they were outside waiting for her. Belle smiled and walked out with the gift in hand.<br />
After a while, they arrived at the party, Belle greeted her friend Ivanna with a hug and gave her her gift.<br />
<br />
&quot;Belle! Nice to see you did. Thank you so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you enjoy your gift. I know you will like it, after all you are interested in that stuff.&quot; Belle replied smiling happily<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to see what it is!&quot; Ivanna said, before placing you in a room along with other gifts.<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t believe what was happening, the only thing you could hear was the loud music from the party. From what it seems Belle had given you Ivanna, you didn&#39;t dislike her, but you didn&#39;t expect to get to know her better this way. Now it was highly unlikely that it was a joke, but you really hoped it was… <br />
<br />
The next day, in the afternoon. Ivanna began to open the presents one by one. When she opened the bag you were in she exclaimed &quot;So this is what you mean Belle! They are really beautiful, they are even my size from what I see on the label&quot;<br />
&quot;I hope you feel as good as you look&quot; Ivanna said as she lowered her pants and slowly began to put you on.<br />
As Ivanna was raising you, her figure molded you slowly, without tightening her too much, and even lifting her butt a little, you slowly enter between her cheeks, what would come to be your &quot;face&quot; was in the part from behind, so you could only feel the pressure that your body made on her butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, they are super comfortable!&quot; Ivanna exclaimed, before sitting down again to open the rest of the gifts, slowly crushing you with her weight...<br />
<br />
After opening all the gifts and leaving them in her room, she…</p>
