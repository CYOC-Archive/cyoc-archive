<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frank was staring at me with a devoius grin on his face. I didn&#39;t get why. I mean, I&#39;m not his friend but at least I didn&#39;t bully him in school like Darius. Maybe, he knows that I previously stole the gun and he was trying to punish me or something.<br />
<br />
As he watched, I kept my eyes on him too while I barely glanced at the other kids around us. Everybody looked scared, especially after Darius turned into a fat muscle middle age man. They didn&#39;t know how popular are daddy bears. At least, Frank seemed happy that he isn&#39;t the only adult there anymore.<br />
<br />
He was ready to shoot me, I know it, and I was assuming I would end up as old as my dad in a few minutes. However, without taking his eyes from me, Frank shot the gun to a bewildered guy next to him, Rick. I don&#39;t know much about him, I only know he&#39;s 12 years old, maybe in 6th grade. He has an average body in every aspect. Not very tall nor small, black hair and a squarish face. He kinda looked like a young Josh Hutcherson, IMO.<br />
<br />
As the ray gun hit his chest, all Rick&#39;s body started to glow green. The green light blinded us a little but we&#39;re able to see that it had started to change Rick&#39;s age. He tried to protect himself with his hands as he yelled at Frank. “Hey! What the hell?!”<br />
<br />
I know the transformation isn&#39;t painful but Rick seemed very displeased as he closes his eyes and groaned. His nose was tickling in a funny way, like if he was allergic to the beam. “Oh man! What is going on??” Rick yelled as we stared at him, except for Darius who was still exploring his new body. “Oooooo” Rick complained like if he was feeling sick.<br />
<br />
He got tired of his futile attempt to cover himself with his hands and he extended them over his head like if he was pushed by an invisible force. Everyone was startled by the sight of thick hairy and broad arms. It looked to resemble adult arms not kid&#39;s. Rick noticed it but before he could say anything all his body began to tingle.<br />
<br />
He looked down and noticed that he was getting taller. He stretched to about 6’ which was a big growth spurt for a 12 year old. “Ugh!!” Rick felt as his clothes began to feel tight from his growth spurt. His shoes tried to contain his growing feet but couldn’t resist the pressure that his growth was causing. His shoes bursted open letting Rick’s now size 13 feet free, except for the tight black sock still struggling to cover them. He clenched his large toes and the socks ripped off instantly.<br />
<br />
Just then Rick started to tingle again. “Oh no!” He was sweating uncontrollably. The now 18 year old Rick was about to go through a major transformation and he knew it. He crouched over in pain as his body began to grow a bit more. We heard his bones cracking and popping as his back and torso widened. He began to gain muscle all over. His thighs expanded greatly and his legs formed nice broad calfs.<br />
<br />
Rick was suffering despite I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t painful. He was intensely groaning as he started to scratch himself and I immediately realized that he was feeling itchy. He surely felt it on his face, arms, legs and in his tight underwear. “Ah!!” Rick cried out in a now deep voice. He put his hand to his throat and he felt a large lump. I knew exactly what it was, an Adam’s apple.<br />
<br />
Just then he felt his clothes getting even tighter. “Ugh!! What now??!!” Rick said clenching his fists. “No more please!” He pleaded. Just then his shirt busted open revealing large pecs and a muscular but large beer belly to match. He flexed his arms as they gained both fat and muscle. His body seemed to be adding a different type of mass this time.<br />
<br />
Rick&#39;s pants started to tear all over especially in the back. His ass was being pushed out quickly as it grew larger and thicker. Suddenly his waist was too big and the pants busted right off his body. His shirt was torn off by his large upper torso and all that was left of clothing were his tight Captain America underwear for children.<br />
<br />
Rick looked down at his tiny package waiting for it to catch up with the rest of his overgrown body but he suddenly groaned, no, he moaned as an immense sensation of pleasure took over him. “Uuuuuuugh!” Rick’s eyes rolled back as his dick began to lengthen and his balls began to expand. Rick moaned continously as his package caught up to the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
“Oooo man! Please!! I can&#39;t be as old as my dad!!  He&#39;s 40!” Rick pleaded to Frank one last time, but the adult counselor just ignored him as he watched the older man moaning uncontrollably. “UUUGH!! Ah!! UGH!”  Rick was in an orgasmic frenzy as he kneeled and tried to free his new manhood as it bulged obscenely from the Captain America&#39;s face in his tight underwear. “AAAAH! OOH! UGH!” Rick shouted as he released a thick white substance all over his small clothing.<br />
<br />
Rick was breathing heavily. He looked down at his new body and noticed that he was the same age as his dad. His body also resembled his dad’s. Rick was taking in his new body. He caressed every muscle. The only down thing was his stomach whose beer belly partially hide his feet when he looked down. “Aw man! At least I could end up without my dad&#39;s beer belly!” Rick shouted resigning to the fact that he was going to stay like this for the rest of the summer.<br />
<br />
“Who&#39;s next?!” Darius ironically said as he walked towards Rick and put a hand over one of Rick&#39;s big shoulders and told Frank. “I want one of those speedos that Mr. Turin offered us, please. Maybe you two could use them too. Those bulges are obscene and disgusting!!” Both Rick and Frank looked down and noticed that their huge manhoods were poking out of their tiny undies. They blushed and agreed with Darius whose dick was poking out of his tight boxers too.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;ll change your clothes after everyone gets older” Mr. Turin said as he came back. “I don&#39;t want you to miss the next transformations” He took the age gun from Frank&#39;s hand and glanced at Rick&#39;s wet crotch. “Richard, or I should say, mr. Robinson. I can see you couldn&#39;t control your new hormones.” Rick blushed in shame. “Well, thanks. I can confirm my theory that the growing up process is way more intense on prepubescent boys.” He stared at the rest of us. “However, we need more test before we can conclude it.”</p>
