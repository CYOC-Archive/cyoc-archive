<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron was breathing heavily, he had never run so fast in his life, not all the times he played football under the lights on Friday nights or when he was running track in high school. None of those times was life or death on the line or remaining human. The college junior had been at the nearby local university helping with the evacuation of the town as the Military had announced they would be pulling back from the major city in a few hours and their town would be without protection from the animal human hybrids spreading there. <br />
<br />
He had been helping along with many of his friends, when suddenly a large group of the creatures came out of the nearby woods. The cops, armed civilians and the military personal tried to hold them back but it became pure chaos as people began to be either killed and eaten by the creatures or turned into creatures themselves. <br />
<br />
“Run!” yelled his girlfriend in his mind as one of the creatures bit her arm as she tried to help someone else. “RUN AARON LEAVE ME!”<br />
<br />
To his shame he had left her and more then a few of his friends behind as he ran back into town but once he did look behind him and he thought he saw someone or something following him. As he did, he saw that the town itself was falling, there where creatures in houses as he ran down the streets. He saw blood trails on the street and the sound of gunfire was now constant. A roar filled the air as a fighter jet flew overhead before dropping a couple bombs on a nearby neighborhood which quickly turned into a firestorm.<br />
<br />
He ran onto his street passing abounded cars but for the most part his neighborhood seamed peaceful. His own driveway, the SUV his parents were preparing to leave in was still there. He had to tell them to get out now, maybe the backroads the highway would be clog he figured. <br />
<br />
He ran past the SUV and into the garage before going in the backdoor leading into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
He was about to yell for his parents and siblings when he stopped in his tracks. <br />
<br />
From the large open kitchen, he saw the dinning room table and into the living room, the dinning room table was covered with bags ready to be loaded however the back door was busted open. There lying on the couch facing the TV was his parents…or what his parents had become.<br />
<br />
His father had become a massive bear man, his beer belly turned to solid muscles as short brownish black hair covered his body. He had to have grown at least two or three feet and while he couldn’t make out his face he figured it was still semi human a lot of them where. He couldn’t see his face because his parents where busy doing it on the coach. His mother was moaning in pleasure as she finished transforming. Her body shifting as her cloths fell away, her body becoming larger however her neck was growing much longer as her skin shifted to the color and pattern of a giraffe. As he watched horrified, he couldn’t help but think his parents looked younger, there were stories of age regression and even gender change among the victims of the virus. There had been a lot of documentation cases of inter species relationships even after the humans in the area had disappeared, some weird people online actually debated if a child could be born from an inter species union. None of that mattered at the moment. Lost in pleasure neither of his parents had noticed him.<br />
<br />
“Do you want more tea Mr. Hopper?” said a sweat voice from the formal dinning room to his right as Aaron looked to see his little sister, the baby of the family who was only 6 years old nearly twenty years younger than him or his other sister. She was the whops child, but everyone loved her. She was sitting with her back toward him, she hadn’t noticed him either. He was about to call for her when he noticed two rather large bunny ears poking out of her long blonde hair. Her skin was a yellowish fur and while she did wear clothing it was clear she wasn’t human anymore. He recalled stories that the very young and very old creatures did wear cloths, maybe it was some lingering human formality that the very young and the very old should be covered. <br />
<br />
“Why yes.” Said his little sister in a slightly different voice as she moved and poured a very red liquid, clearly blood into the teacup of a stuffed bunny. A freshly killed man, his neighbor was lying on the table. She was playing tea party with her stuffed animals like she always did as a human but now using human blood.<br />
<br />
Then a roar filled the air, coming from almost straight above him…that was his twin sister’s bedroom. She had stayed to help their parents pack while he went to help at the college. The sound of music followed, the music she tended to listen to whenever she was pleasuring herself. That along with the roar meant she was a creature to, unknown what kind but she was one too and she may not be alone up there.<br />
<br />
So far none of them had noticed him, that gave him a few options.<br />
<br />
He could back out of the house but if any of his friends or his girlfriend followed him, they would be waiting for him. The keys to the SUV was on the table only a couple of feet away, he could get in it and go but they would hear him start the engine for sure and they would be after him.<br />
<br />
He could sneak past his little bunny sister and try to make it downstairs to the gun safe. That had his fathers’ larger guns which he could possibly use to held defend himself. These monster…his family where hard to kill but not unkillable but downstairs he would have no way out if they trapped him down there.<br />
<br />
He could sneak past his parents still lost in their love making and head upstairs, he had a smaller pistol and a few knives in his room. They would be less useful but upstairs he had a better chance of getting away if discovered. Still, he would have to get past his parents and his sister who was upstairs but he had read stories about how people got past creatures lost in pleasure...but how many didn’t and ended up getting caught.</p>
