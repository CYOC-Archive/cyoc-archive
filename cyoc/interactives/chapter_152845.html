<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon’s heart rate shot up as he felt it pounding in his chest as he suddenly lost balance and fell backwards into the water. He hadn’t gone too deep, only up to his waist but it was deep enough as he disappeared totally under water. He looked straight up and he could see the light from the full moon coming through the surface. He attempted to hold his breath, but he couldn’t and he prepared for death however he kept breathing.<br />
<br />
“Just relax, everything will be ok.” Said his movie as she rested on the soft sand beside him. “The Change will take a few minutes, but your real self will be finally out. You have spent almost 18 years living a lie, now it is time for your real self to come out.” <br />
<br />
Damon couldn’t relax as he felt so strange, his entire body felt like it was shifting as and strangely the pressure he should have felt from being under water lessened. <br />
<br />
“Just relax.” Said his mother as she reached out and brushed her hand over his cheek and as she did some of his hair came into sight. However before his eyes it changed from a brown to a dark red color. “Ah…your hair is the same color as your sister and your grandmother.”<br />
<br />
“Sister?” inquired Damon his voice sounding so strange underwater.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I should have explained the reason you lived so many years on land with that man was because I am the third daughter of the King of the Ocean you call the Atlantic. I was wild child when I was younger and meet your father and had you.” explained his mother “However as a princess I was to marry one of the dukes of the Sea and my father wouldn’t let me keep you so to hide you from my new husband he took you from me and gave you to your father changing you, preventing you from being who you are. However now my Father is dead and so is my husband and your siblings wants to meet you, to bring you home.”  <br />
<br />
“Siblings.” Said Damon as he tried to move again, only to find that he now could move his head and he could move his fingers but not his arms yet. He lifted his head up and looked down and felt his heart stop, instead of his normal flat chest two large mounds where growing out of his chest. <br />
<br />
“Your becoming such a beautiful mermaid, Scarlett.” Said his mother as she moved behind him and helped him up resting him against her chest letting him see what was happening to him. His mother kissed the side of his face and through his eyes he could see tear like bubbles forming around his mother’s eyes. One of her hands was going through his hair was another helped keep her steady. “Yes, Scarlett that is your real name, my beautiful missing daughter. Now just relax.”<br />
<br />
Damon didn’t answer his eyes where transfixed on the changes as it worked his way down his body and up his arms. His chest was filling out to at least C cup breasts even as his sides narrowed and his hips widened. He still had a tone stomach but now it was feminine instead of the near six pack he had had only a few minutes ago. His arms lost muscle tone but became more slender and graceful, even his fingernails which where normally chip from working at his part time construction job became perfectly manicured and web skin formed between his finger joints. <br />
<br />
Damon watched in horror as his manhood grew small and tiny, before with a pop it disappeared into his body, he was now a she and it was a horrifying idea, he has a girlfriend who he loves and was a source of light in his dark life with his father. Then he noticed his legs had lost all the hair and had seamed to elongated. He watched as his legs seamed to be pulled together into a single mass. The gap between the legs disappeared as he felt the leg bones seam to merge together into a single bone group with a large amount of muscles around it. He could still see his womanhood, an idea he never thought he would have and then he saw dark red scales begin to appear over his new tail. The bulk of his tail became covered with red scales but he had some golden scale mixed in and a few strips of golden scales. All the scales stopped around his hips but not it wasn’t a clean line but instead he had a few up by his belly button but none beyond that. His feet turned to the side and became a long fluke with semi clear red membrane.<br />
<br />
“There, Scarlett your finally home, your finally where you belong.” Said his mother as she kissed his forehead. “My daughter, is finally back. Welcome home.”</p>
