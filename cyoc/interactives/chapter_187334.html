<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Queen stroked over her gravid swell as she stood behind the curtains to the council room, smiling down fondly at her belly, she then let out a moan as she felt her Prince within roll and kick within his new prison, and yet even though the queen felt grate sorrow that she would never hold her son again, she couldn&#39;t help but be turned on at the thought of being this round and full untill the end of time, She let out a groan as she let her hand slip to the underside of her belly, her fingers now brushing lightly at her clit, but she knew she had to compose herself if her conquest was to be a success.<br />
<br />
The Queen then straight herself up, now resting her hands atop her belly, folding them neatly on its peak before stepping out into the council Chambers, the room was silent, every witch and warlock gazing wide eyed at their queen&#39;s new form, the queen payed them no mind as she stepped infront of her throne before spreading her legs and easing herself down, letting her belly fall between her legs as she stroked over its surface, suddenly Adam, the warlock of the Eastern dunes stood up from his seat and aproched the queen, the room was silent as everyone watched him accent to the queen&#39;s side, she watched him with amused curiosity as he reached her side before he got down on one knee and placed his fist over his chest, looking up at the queen with devoted admonition &quot;my queen, I would like to congratulate you on your future child, I do not know nore care how you became so full with child so fast, but it is a blessing not just alone you but all of our nations that your line will continue&quot; said Adam as he placed his hand over his forehead before pressing his fingers against her wombs surface, a blessing to expectant mothers in the Eastern deserts.<br />
<br />
The Queen smiled down at Adam and bowed in thanks for the gift he had bestowed upon her son, unfortunately it would be a gift that would never be used, for his gift was that she would have a successful birth, yet she didn&#39;t want to spoil her most loyal followers act of love and compassion by telling him that, so she simply let out a light moan as she certessed her belly, feeling her son now sleeping within, it was only then that she realised that Adam&#39;s hand was still on her belly, his hand now drifting to its underside as the Queen smirked and arched her back, letting her belly out further.<br />
<br />
Adam then looked around the room, and as much as he wanted to show his undying love to his queen, he couldn&#39;t destroy her image infront of all if her followers, so he simply retrected his hand, watching as a small pout apeared on the queen&#39;s lips, before bowing and returning to his seat.<br />
<br />
It was then that the queen put her new plan into action as she heaved her pregnant form from her throne, cupping one hand beneath her large round belly and the other stayed on her swells peak as she gazed around the room, knowing that in a few moments only a select few would remain as they are, the queen once again fashioned collars of her own magic, she steadied her breathing and tensed her muscles, ready once again to strike, and she did, to everyone&#39;s shock their queen let her collars fly accross the room, each wrapping around their targets necks like snakes.<br />
<br />
Veins of the witches and warlocks magic became visible over their skin, the pulse of their magic visible in the glow of vein like lines accross their bodies, the pulsing all being drawn to the collar as their limbs and body erupted into pink mist, leaving only their collars rattling to the floor, now only five out of the original twenty witches and warlocks remained, with Adam being the only warlock and Willow, Ruby, Rose and Lilac being the only remaining witches, all of them jumped back from the table, staring in shock at what was left of their fellow council members.<br />
<br />
&quot;My queen?, why would you do this to them, they lived to serve you as much as I&quot; said Adam as he looked up at the queen with horror in his deep brown eyes, his blonde hair falling down above his brow from his sudden retreat, the queen gave him a gentle look as she walked down her steps to her throne &quot;we are entering a new age my people, an age of prosperity, an age of power&quot; she said as she then looked down and placed her hands over her swolen womb &quot;an age of life&quot; she sighed as she then looked up at her chosen few &quot;in this new age the gifted and strong will survive, to rule and unite the fey world, and some day soon, concour our jealous human rivals accross the border, but first we must make you all strong and fertile to begin our rain&quot; said the Queen as she flicked her wrist and all of the collars chose a target and wrapped themselves accross their bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;My queen please I sware my loyalty to you, I always have but please you can&#39;t make us disappear as well&quot; Cried lady Rose as she frantically tried to remove one of the collars from her forearm, but the queen only chuckled as she waddled over to Rose and stroked accross her cheek, wiping one of her tears away &quot;Don&#39;t worry my princess, soon you will join your siblings and give mommy the strength to proceed to bring our new age to reality&quot; cooed the queen as suddenly the four witches vanished in puffs of pink smoke.<br />
<br />
Now only she and Adam remained, both on either side of the round wooden table, the queen then began to walk around to him, the pink smoke flowing at her heals as she waddled, her hand brushing along the tables surface as she seductively waddled, letting Addam drink in her pregnant sexy body, she then groaned as she then began to crawl along the table towards him, her belly and hips swaying as she did so, her milk filled tits hanging heavily from her chest while her creamy milk drip to the table as she whent before lying on her back in the center with her legs in a birthing position waiting for Adam to make his move.<br />
<br />
And move he did as the magic from the collars began to gush into his tissues, his body began to grow, his skeleton becoming larger and more solid, his ribcage being replaced with a solid bone plate to act as a natural armour, his dark skin became richer and more soft to the touch, yet gaining a strength like dragons scales, hi muscles began to gain mass as he made his way over to his queen, his robes now too small to contain his new form as they ripped from his body, which now resembled that of a spartan warrior, his body now looking like it had been carved by the gods themselves, every muscle defined and firm as he now knelt between his queen&#39;s spread legs, now gazing in awe and hunger at her slightly agape pussy, never before had he seen something so beautiful and so stimulating in all his life as he then moved closer to his queen as she looked at him aproch with a lustfull smile on her face.<br />
<br />
Adam then placed his hands either side of the queen&#39;s body, his face in line with her body as he leaned down and kissed its surface gently, as if trying to kiss every inch of its surface, he loved his queen with everything his was and everything he was yet to be, and the queen knew this as well, she had wanted him since the moment she had met him, yet because of his small territory and influence the council had deemed him unworthy to merge his line with anyone else, oh the irony, as now he stood over her, stronger and more powerfully than every one of the council combined, the ultimate of his kind, and soon to be her future king...</p>
