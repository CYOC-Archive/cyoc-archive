<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the aliens looked on at the girl strapped to the operating table they seemed to be arguing rather loudly in a language that she could not understand.<br />
<br />
In a panic, her eyes darted back and forth around the room the unfamiliar surroundings were very concerning to her and further exacerbated her panic, she was not actually strapped down she found out it was more like the light above her was increasing the gravity to the point that she couldn&#39;t move. Try as she might she was not able to move making the thoughts of escape moot as she realized there were no straps to break or anything she could do to get away from the light the held her steadfast in place.<br />
<br />
As Jen tried to work on an escape plan to get out of this she heard cheering from the four other occupants in the room. She looked over and saw a display showing what looked like a fighting game character running and jumping around the screen the aliens looked at Jen with enthusiastic looks in their dark black eyes as they pointed at the character.<br />
<br />
They were talking but Jen still had no idea what they were saying. She watched as the character moved around the screen when her assets grew. She kept running and fighting but the now her boobs and but were erratically bouncing with every movement, when she stopped there was a delay on when they would calm down in to a “resting position” where they still bounced but more subdued.<br />
<br />
Confused by what the Aliens were attempting to communicate to her she looked at the screen and said “yeah, that is a fighting game from earth. If you want I can get that for you. Just let me go and I will do it.”<br />
<br />
they smiled and nodded. Three of them went over and began pushing buttons while one stayed back and reached into the light. It turned Jen over onto her side away from the screen.<br />
<br />
She knew this was not a good thing and began to fruitlessly struggle against the alien. Once on her side it began rubbing a cold gel on her exposed butt cheeks then it walked over still smiling and began rubbing the gel on Jens exposed breasts.<br />
<br />
They were going numb where the gel touched began to tingle, it never died down, it actually increased she looked down with the limited movement she could do and watched as two suction cup like devices were attached to her boobs and she felt similar things being attached to her butt.<br />
<br />
“please stop, I don&#39;t know what is happening but please stop!” she cried out to her abductors in a last ditched effort to stop whatever they were going to do to her. <br />
<br />
Her cries fell on deaf ears as she felt a hum coming from above her and the cups activated, it was unreal how good this felt. Jen cried out in pleasure and shut her eyes tight.<br />
<br />
unbeknownst to her the light changed and lowered the presure on her so she began floating, with this increase in movement she began humping the air. <br />
<br />
She has never experienced pleasure like this it just kept building.<br />
<br />
In the back of her head she could hear screaming that this is wrong but was getting lost in the pleasure and began moaning with each pulse from the devices attached to her.<br />
<br />
Finally she came, after the massive build up in what was the most pleasure she had ever experienced. The devices released with a hiss and dropped to the table, Jen remained floating basking in the afterglow of what was by far the best orgasm she has ever experienced.<br />
<br />
As her mind cleared she looked down and dread filled her mind.<br />
<br />
Her boobs were the size of watermelons with similar results to her butt cheeks. She tentatively reached around and realized how difficult it was to grab her other arm.<br />
<br />
She drew her arm back quickly and was shocked by how much movement that action produced, they were both bouncing all around like physics did not apply to them.<br />
<br />
She was able to calm them down by holding them in place but as she let go they still moved around casually. They were like giant round water-balloons with to much elasticity.<br />
<br />
That is when she realized that was what the aliens were saying, they were asking if that was something she would be willing to have done... and they did it.<br />
<br />
They smiled to her and waved at her.<br />
<br />
She was confused but realized they were getting blurry. Soon her head dropped and she was asleep.<br />
<br />
When she wakes up...</p>
