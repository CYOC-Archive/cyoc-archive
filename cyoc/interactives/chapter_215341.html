<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Though... I should note that my dad doesn&#39;t know about me being a werecat now,&quot; Rachel spoke up, remembering one of her answers and thinking she hadn&#39;t clarified it enough, &quot;it was more finding out that I was a lesbian that he didn&#39;t like... but as I said, with my mom and my sisters. I&#39;m happy... and I wouldn&#39;t want them to change who they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others nodded and gave an approving nod, which Rachel took with some relief. It was all part of a meeting that was moving forward and giving Rachel a level of comfort around other weres that she didn&#39;t feel she&#39;d ever had before. It was something that was advancing things and made her feel better, and to a degree even raised some of her curiosity at eventually joining a pride, but she wasn&#39;t going to make any decision on which, yet. After all, Angela&#39;s pride was likely only one of several in the area and Cynthia had already made the offer to introduce Rachel to the other prides. It thus would make sense to take Cynthia up on her offer and not commit to any one pride until she&#39;d at least met the leaders of those prides.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still a good family,&quot; Jessica said to Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ultimately looking to join a pride?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ultimately...&quot; Rachel said slowly, &quot;meeting all of you and getting answers to some of the bigger questions I&#39;ve had... about myself actually goes a long way to putting things at ease.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good to hear,&quot; Maggie commented with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, for the moment, I wouldn&#39;t know on which pride to join,&quot; Rachel said slowly, &quot;you&#39;ve all been nice... and helpful... but you aren&#39;t the only werecat pride in Moon Lake, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct,&quot; Angela agreed, &quot;there are only about five or six werecat prides active in Moon Lake, though their sizes vary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a friend at the college who&#39;s invited me to meet those prides,&quot; Rachel stated, &quot;I was thinking on taking her up on her offer before making any decision on which pride to join.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would make sense,&quot; Angela nodded, &quot;and you can tell this friend you&#39;ve already met the Richards&#39; pride... or at least most of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel found herself smiling and nodding in agreement. She hoped that Cynthia wouldn&#39;t be to upset about her meeting one of the prides before anything formal could be worked out. As, she didn&#39;t think that Cynthia could have known about Isabelle being sent to meet with her. It would make a lot of things come off as a pleasant surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;The one thing that might have me nervous is the fact that I&#39;m new... and that any pride that would take might have to provide some... help,&quot; Rachel said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That should be no problem,&quot; Linus spoke up, &quot;both Mrs. Richards and my pride accepted me. And she accepted Julia as well. A lot of times, weres will get curious over new arrivals, and with a rather small town here, people will have a fairly friendly attitude. Regardless of whether or not one is a normal human or a were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There might be some degree of concern and worry... as you are from outside Moon Lake,&quot; Julia nodded, &quot;but a lot of that might be eased by the fact that you are already a were. And most of the concerns and worries that may be had will relate to protecting Moon Lake. But since your family was technically already compliant with the Mandatory Were Law when you moved into town, a lot of that won&#39;t be an issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not so sure on everyone,&quot; Rachel said slowly.<br />
<br />
She got a strange sense of trust from Angela and Julia, perhaps it was because they were mothers like her mother was, and she was still new enough to Moon Lake that not everyone would be the same. After all, she remembered the run in with Mace while Cynthia was running the D and D game at the Freshman dorms. He hadn&#39;t been cruel or evil, but he was definitely protective and suspicious and gave the commentary that people from outside Moon Lake were &quot;weird.&quot; Now, Mace ultimately came around and understood things after she explained Leslie&#39;s raping of her and he was apologetic for his earlier actions, but he did represent the potential for someone to be a bit territorial and protective. Though from the raised eyebrows from Linus and the other women there soon raised the thought that they didn&#39;t accept that very well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean... there could be some that may worry about how I would behave or be there for them,&quot; Rachel said slowly, &quot;and... a lot of what happened to me does hurt, and I&#39;m to see Doctor Suyin Chen on Friday. Wouldn&#39;t other prides have some concerns on that? I mean, some other weres I&#39;ve met have had some of that concern... at least at knowing that I was new to Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just going to be some defensive side of things,&quot; Julia commented, &quot;and I don&#39;t think any of the werecat prides have anyone of that issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I certainly don&#39;t,&quot; Angela nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that goes for all of us,&quot; Maggie commented and looked to Linus, &quot;and you&#39;ve been quite helpful whenever we&#39;ve had something big come up at these meetings and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Linus answered and then looked to Rachel as she chewed on one of the side dishes that had been with the dinner provided, &quot;and that shows on where the acceptance can go. Now granted, this is the pride my wife joined... but they did accept me as a werewildcat and it all works out. Some other prides and groups might be defensive and suspicious at first, and I won&#39;t lie and say that you won&#39;t have to explain some things that happened to you... BUT once that happens, they should accept you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s been our experience,&quot; Julia spoke, &quot;but most weres are generally pretty accepting. Not just werecats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
Linus and Julia both nodded to that, and to a degree, that was all that was needed.</p>
