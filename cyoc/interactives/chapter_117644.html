<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff checked the kitchen to see which piece of food would become a hot sexy woman.  He went from the fridge to the pantries to find something far suitable.  After a bit of searching, he spotted something that he could use.  On the table counter is a box of yellow marshmallow Peeps in the shape of baby chicks.  Those peeps were left there a few weeks after Easter and no one hasn’t eaten them yet.  But since they don’t expire much, they would still be edible to eat, or in Jeff’s case, good enough to change.  Seeing this, he knew what to choose.  “A peep to an actual chick?” he asked himself, “That would be perfect!”  He soon picked up the box of peeps and hurried upstairs to try the Chronivac out on them.<br />
<br />
Quickly returning to his room, he closed and locks the door so he would have some privacy and placed the box on his bed.  Opening the package up, he picked up one of the Peeps and return to the computer that still has the Inanimate to Human package on the Chronivac.  Looking at it, he wondered how to start the changes.  “Now let’s see…” he said to himself, “This Chronivac said that you have to turn any inanimate object into a human.  But in order for me to change this little Peep into a full-blown hottie, I need to make sure that it’s accurate.  Otherwise, one mistake could lead to me turning all the Peeps into women.”<br />
<br />
Looking to the program, he could see a button in upload pictures, preferably the inanimate object that the user wants to turn into a human.  Seeing this, he decided to try it that way and picked up his camera on the desk.  Placing the peep on the table, he took a good picture of it and headed to the computer to hit the Upload button.  Searching through is picture files, he spotted the picture he took and clicked on it.  Soon enough, the picture was uploaded and it showed the exact same picture he took of the Peep and was pleased with what he did.<br />
<br />
Scrolling down, he spotted all the information of the type of human a user would turn an inanimate object into.  Everything from gender, age, race, IQ, occupation, status, sexuality, even a clothing option that the inanimate object turned human would have clothing that matches what the newly created human use to be.  There were other options too on the choices you make, like if the human is female, there will be breast size, or male for muscle definition.  And at the bottom of the options is the duration of the change, and returning the human to its original state, with the option next to it and says, ‘Permanent’ or ‘I’ll change it for later’.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to the list of things and was amazed at the sight of it.  He can make so many options out of this Peep in his options are limitless.  Still, he’s main goal is to turn this little Peep into a super sexy woman.  So with intent, he started to put together the information he needed to create this woman out of a piece of marshmallow treat.  Once he typed everything together, he looked to the list and skimmed it to see if he didn’t miss out on anything.  This is what he typed down.<br />
<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Age: 25<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
Body Type: Voluptuous<br />
Breast Size: CC<br />
IQ: 150<br />
Occupation: None<br />
Status: Single<br />
Sexuality: 50%<br />
Clothing to Fit the Change: Yes<br />
Mental Changes: Yes<br />
Awareness: Yes<br />
Duration of Change: 1 Minute<br />
Time to Change Back: I’ll change it for later<br />
<br />
Looking to all of this, he was pleased with what he did.  With all of his options, he could see that he will make a hot babe into a piece of marshmallow sugary candy.  He scrolled down and saw the ‘Begin Change’.  But before he could do that, he decided to do one more thing.  Taking the Peep off his desk, he placed it on the middle of the floor, as he knows that keeping it anyplace else would be a bit uncomfortable for the soon to be human.  Once he got it down, he returned to the computer and clicked on the begin change icon.  By then, there was a warning that appeared that says…<br />
<br />
‘Warning: By accepting the change, the Chronivac isn’t responsible to the damage or death of the changed target.  If anything happened to this said target, the changes would be permanent and the target won’t return to normal.  Do you wish to continue?’<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to this option and could tell that there will be some risk involved.  But it is on a piece of Easter candy, so he knows that there are no consequences.  With that said, he clicked on the ‘Yes’ button and another message appeared that says…<br />
<br />
‘Thank you for choosing the Chronivac 4.0.  We hope you will enjoy the changes.’<br />
<br />
Looking at the message, it disappeared and the countdown timer appeared starting with a minute.  Soon enough, it started to countdown from 1:00 to 0:59 to 0:58 and ticking away.  Knowing it started, he turned to look at the little Peep to see if there were any changes yet.  So far, he didn’t see anything as of yet, but then he noticed that it started to tingle a little bit.  Almost immediately, he could see the changes starting.<br />
<br />
The first thing that happened is that the Peep start to grow in size, as it grew big enough to become a beanbag.  As it was growing, she could see the Peep starting to loose it’s shape and molded around to a slightly taller from.  Four little nubs appeared on the sides, two of which on the close to the shifting head and two as the bottom.  These said nubs started to grow and stretch to make the growing yellow blob taller.  During the changers, a few rippage on the sugary yellow substance started to show on the neckline and the four growing nubs at the upper parts, showing the white marshmallow part and slowly spreading.  In fact, the white spread up to the head that the white stuff surrounded the brown dots that’s suppose to be the eyes.  Jeff watched on and was amazed at how fast it was changing.  So much so that it looked less like a Peep and more human like.  But it was just the beginning as the changes accelerated more and more.<br />
<br />
The stubs started to gain mass and toned into female like proportion.  The top front started to explode out and rounded into a huge globe while it split in the middle forming what looks like a pair of breasts.  The lower back ballooned out as well and made a bubbly butt, while the middle curved out and the sides expanded, turning into a slim and shapely hourglass.  The white marshmallow substance started to darken a little bit into a light peachy substance as it gone soft and smooth, almost looking like human skin.  Her insides started to hollow out completely as organs and bones grew in to keep her both alive and standing.<br />
<br />
The yellow sugary coating then changed next as they were turning into pieces of clothing.  The big yellow stuff around the feminine body turned from sugar to silk like as it grew tightly around it to form some serious cleavage around the breasts while the bottom part grew down to reach the mid calf, turning into a yellow, skin tight, strapless tube dress.  The yellow parts on at the ends of the stubs grew up to the feminine biceps and the texture turned to latex.  The pointy ends of the started to split in five little nubs and became thin and dainty, looking like hands and fingers while the yellow stuff turned into long and elegant gloves.  The same yellow substance at the bottom stubs grew up to above the knees and that too turned into latex as well.  The pointy stub started to go into a triangle shape and the rest formed into a feminine foot.  The back end started to rise up and formed a cork heel that goes up to three inches, forming into a high heel boot.  Jeff was in awe as the body was that of the woman she envisioned, but the head was a bit of a Peep like creature.  But that would soon change as the final ten seconds begin the last of the changes.<br />
<br />
The top part of the Peep’s head was molding around as it took a female like look.  First of all, the head shapened into an oval structure and frames itself in a face of a wound woman with two brown dots.  A neck soon started to stick out, as multiple holes appeared on the sides, above the brown dots, one more below the two.  Soon enough cartilage started to grow from the holes and formed specific parts of the face.  The two on the side grew out and rounded into an oval like shape with additional growths on the inside, forming a pair of petite ears.  The skin in the middle grew out and got pointy, forming into a thin nose as the woman started to take a deep breathe into her newly developed lungs.  The hole below the nose started to grow wide as Jeff could hear light moaning coming out of it, as she was developing some vocal cords.  He could see the inside of her mouth changing as he could see the uvula forming and a tongue growing out of the changing mouth, moving around by itself.  Gums were starting to form as a row of pearly white teeth grew out from top to bottom.  And finally fat grew in to form a set of puffy and kissable lips as yellow lipstick was magically applied on them.  The two brown dots then stretched out into two thin lines and begins to deepen around them and what looks like eyelashes were growing out.  He doesn’t know it, but he knew that her actual eyes were being created behind those new lids.  Just then thin lines of yellow hair grew above those eyes, forming what looked like eyebrows.  And the remaining yellow sugar on top of the head turned into a buzz but of blonde hair as it grew out and down her neck, shifting style into a short cut that is similar to Raven’s from the Teen Titans.  Finally, a brain started to grow in her head as she was feeling human knowledge seeping in from walking, to eating, to driving, to education all the way to college, and even understanding sex.  She moaned loudly one last time as the changes were finished.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked on and was completely amazed.  What was once a marshmallow Peep to eat for Easter, has turned into a hot and voluptuous woman in a super sexy outfit in about a minute.  This newly created woman took a breather and slowly opened her eyes, which are still brown just when she was a piece of candy.  She looked around the room and started to process what has happened.  But then, she looked down to Jeff who was still fixated in the whole change entirely.  He blinked a little and didn’t know how to respond.  Finally, he lifted his hand up and uttered just one word.<br />
<br />
“Hi…”<br />
<br />
The woman tilted her head and blinked along as well.  Finally, she lifted her hand up and waved back, saying, “Hello…”<br />
<br />
Jeff was amazed at how sweet and soothing her voice is with a hint of lady like class.  He decided talk to the former Peep candy and said, “How are you feeling?”<br />
<br />
Her response is looking down to herself and looking to her newly created hands.  Opening and closing them, her response was, “I…  I never left so… so… alive.”  She then caught notice of her huge breasts and instinctively grabbed them with her hands, squeezing them to feel their softness.  She felt an electric jitter, as she never left anything like that before.  “My word…  Those are real!” she said, “I can’t believe that they feel so soft and squishy.”  She soon turned to the full-length mirror close by and was shocked by her own body.  “Is that me?” she asked herself.  She soon slowly approached it and decided to get a good look at herself in every angle.  “Amazing…  This body looks really exquisite.”  She soon got a closer look at her face and traced her fingers on her cheek.  “And this face…” she continued, “It look so, beautiful.”<br />
<br />
Jeff watched on and was surprised that her reaction was somewhat calming.  It’s almost like that she was excepting this new body and felt like she didn’t want to go back to being a piece of marshmallow sweet.  Still, he needs to make sure that she was fine with it.  Approaching from behind, he asked her, “Do you remember anything before becoming what you are?”<br />
<br />
The Blonde Peep woman heard him and turned around answering as much as he could.  “All I could remember is that I was just a little Peep wanting to be eaten.  Then suddenly, I started to feel something warm and felt like I was growing taller.  I could feel thoughts entering my head that I never felt before and a certain drive that makes me want to live.  When I came to, I have become a human being.  Please tell me, young man, did you do this to me?”<br />
<br />
Jeff was amazed that this woman remembered what she once was before being turned into a human.  It was like that peeps have sentient thoughts, or some form of it that makes them believes that they are destined to be eaten.  Now it looks like she deserves more then a snack.  Clearing his throat, he decided to speak to her the truth.  “Yes.  It was me.”<br />
<br />
The woman was taken back by this and asked, “How did you turn me into a human.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s response is to show her the computer program he has and explained about it.  “With this.  The Chronivac.  It’s a program that can turn myself or anyone I could choose into whatever I want.  One of the packages can make me turn an inanimate object into a human being.  I thought that if I could turn a certain food item into a sexy woman.  And when I choose you, I never thought that the results could be so promising.”<br />
<br />
The woman heard this and was happy that he did that for her.  Approaching him, she grabbed his hands and lifted it up to her, with a smile and the boundless happiness that she has.  “Thank you for giving me this new life!” she said with hope, “At first being eaten was my destiny.  But thanks to you, I am free to do whatever I want!”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled and said, “Ah…  It’s no big deal.  I was just testing something out to see if it works.  My name is Jeff by the way.”<br />
<br />
The woman nodded and said, “Nice to meet you Jeff.”  Then she realized something else.  “Wait…  I need a name.  I can’t be going around this world with no name to go by.  Who should I call myself…”  She rubbed her chin as she was contemplating on a name.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched her think could tell that she was starting to adjust to this new life of hers.  Knowing that she needed a name, he came up with one and said, “What about…  Peepette.”<br />
<br />
She looked to him and said, “Peepette…?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it is name after what you once were, a Peep.  The ette part is like a Southern last first name and makes you sound like a fair woman.  So it is fitting to who you are.” he explained.<br />
<br />
The woman heard it and realized that he does have a point.  “All right, Peepette it is then.”  The now called Peepette bend over to him and said, “Thanks again for giving me this new life.  Is there anyway in repaying you?”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard her ask that and rubbed his chin.  “Well…”</p>
