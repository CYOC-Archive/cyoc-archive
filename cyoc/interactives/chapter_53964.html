<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Nick had gotten away from the haunting House of Wax that had kept him as a figurine, he had ran straight home. His parents had been relieved to have their son back home safe and sound. He had been gone for so long. They shared a tearful reunion. Unconsciously, Nick made sure that the petrified bodies of Mitchel and Jay were in one piece during the family hug. He kept them in his pockets as he talked to the cops.<br />
<br />
He never told them where he was the entire time. He doubted they would believe he had been turned into a figurine and kept in a wax museum of horrors. Instead he told them he had been held captive in a warehouse. He told them he didn't know who his captor was, which was true. He didn't know who had kidnapped him. He didn't know why he had been turned into a figurine and put on display. Hopefully it would never happen again. <br />
<br />
After all the official business, Nick had gone to his room. His dirty, messy room. Oh how he missed it. He was about to flop down onto his bed when he remembered he had two other occupants with him. Pulling out the figurine turned boys, Nick examined them both. They were both gray in color. Both boys had their arms to their sides, their muscles defined in smooth, waxy material. Jay was a little taller than Mitchel's statue. Both boys had smiles on their petrified faces. In addition, they were both nude, however, both brothers had their genitals removed. There was nothing but a smooth mound were their penises should be. <br />
<br />
nick stared at the figurines, wondering if this was how he looked when he had been petrified. He didn't know how to free them from their prisons. Then a strange thought occurred to him. He looked over to his desk, where some left over gold paint from a school project was resting. He stared at the paint, and then at the figurines. Then back at the paint and once again at the figurines. His mind was made up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I might as well. I don't think I can fix you. And I always thought of you as a trophy boy,&quot; Nick said to Mitchel's figure. He walked over to the paint. he found two flat disks, sort of like thick coasters, and some hot glue. He started with Jay first. gluing the shrunken adolescence to the coaster, Nick let it set before he took the golden paint and started painting Jay. He brought the brush down onto Jay's chest, sweeping the gold paint down the smooth figurine's chest and torso. The brush smoothly ran around Jay's petrified body, covering the gray color with shiny, shimmering gold. Within thirty minutes, Jay was a golden trophy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad. I wonder where this artistic behavior is coming from. Maybe the museum messed with my head. I know this isn't right...but...they look so nice as a statues.&quot; he looked down at Mitchel. &quot;Especially you buddy. Sorry, but at least this way you'll look nice for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
What Nick didn't know was that mitchel was still conscious under his waxy prison. His shrunken body was been covered in wax. he had been parazyled as his body slowly petrified. He could still hear, feel, and see. He had felt Nick pick him up, the feel of his friend's rouch hands caressing his frozen body felt so good. The paint was cold as it touched his body. It sent waves of cold through his body. Unfortunately, the golden paint only further trapped him. He could only see everything in tinted yellow. Still, he got a good look of Nick.<br />
<br />
nick, satisfied with his new trophies, decided it was time for bed. Mitchel watched from his spot on Nick's desk as the blond stripped down to his, or rather Jay's, boxers. Nick's lean, muscular body slid underneath the covers and the boy was out.<br />
<br />
Nick had plans to move on with his old life. However, neither him or his trophy boy would've expected what would happen tomorrow.</p>
