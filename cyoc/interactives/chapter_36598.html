<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When they had returned to the house Dru's parents led her downstairs into the basement. There in a secret room Dru saw an altar.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't want to show you this until you were older&quot; Stacy said. &quot;But circumstances have changed that. I need you to hold onto this kit for a little bit while we start working the magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going on?&quot; Dru asked.<br />
<br />
Stacy chuckled and said &quot;Well since this kit no longer has a family she's going to become part of our family. You're going to have a sister Dru.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dru was stunned. How could the vixen kit become her sister? Her mother handed her the kit and then took out a book and looked through it.<br />
<br />
After awhile Stacy said &quot;I found the spell. It's not exactly what we need but I can twist it to suit our needs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's great hun&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;What do we need to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well first we need to make a potion using three drops of our blood&quot; Stacy said. &quot;After the potion is done we put the kit on the alter and pour the potion on her while chanting the spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't sound too difficult&quot; Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is one catch that I can see&quot; Stacy said. &quot;In order for the transformation to be complete we'll have to be in our human forms when we add our blood to the potion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long will it take to make the potion?&quot; Jeremy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The rest of the night&quot; Stacy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;When do we add our blood to it?&quot; Jeremy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until the very end&quot; Stacy said. &quot;The moon will be down by then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's great then&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;We should have a new daughter by the time I go to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not as easy as that&quot; Stacy said. &quot;The spell has to be completed on the night of the full moon. Preferably when it is waxing or full.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we wait until tonight&quot; Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once we start chanting the spell we need to be in our human forms&quot; Stacy said. &quot;That means all of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could be a problem&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;Dru hasn't learned to control her change yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Stacy said.<br />
<br />
Dru could see the disappointment in her parents eyes. She would only get a new sister when she learned to control her transformation. She didn't want to disappoint her parents so she became determined to control her change. How was she going to control it though? She figured that maybe if she concentrated on her human form that that might change her.<br />
<br />
Dru concentrated on her human form visualizing it as best she could. Just when she thought she wouldn't succeed tonight she felt that familiar tingling she felt when she was transforming before. She concentrated even harder and the tingling grew even stronger. She felt the changes begin to happen.<br />
<br />
Dru's fur pulled in while her feet shortened to human proportions. The claws on her feet became toenails once again while the ones one her hands became fingernails. Her ears moved down her head and became rounded. Her muzzle shrank to form her human face again and her eyes moved back to their original position. Her tail shrank and disappeared. Finally her hair grew out of her bald head and down to her shoulders like it was before. She was human again but the tingling remained and she was afraid that if she let her concentration slip that she'd change back into a were-fox.<br />
<br />
Jeremy said &quot;Well we may get another daughter tonight after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My little vixen pup has learned to control her transformations&quot; Stacy said. &quot;I'm so proud of you Dru.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel aww tingly&quot; Dru said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's natural&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;The moon is still up and your body wants to change. Go ahead and let your body change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dru did as her father said and in no time she was a were-fox again. She was surprised that the vixen kit remained calm during her transformations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you put Dru to bed while I start the potion&quot; Stacy said looking at Jeremy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright hun&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;Come along Dru. The kit can sleep with you. She seems to have bonded with you already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Otay daddy&quot; Dru said as she followed him up to her room.<br />
<br />
Once in Dru's room Jeremy tucked her in and kissed her forehead. The vixen kit curled up on the foot of Dru's bed and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems she knows that she's safe here&quot; Jeremy chuckled. &quot;Good night Dru, sweet dreams.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Night daddy&quot; Dru said and then yawned. She quickly fell asleep.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Dru honey wake up&quot; Stacy said gently shaking Dru awake.<br />
<br />
Dru slowly woke up and looked at her mother. It was definitely daylight and she was back to her human self. She felt a pressure on her bladder and she knew she needed to go to the bathroom. &quot;I need to go potty mommy&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright honey&quot; Stacy said. &quot;Hurry up though. I have a friend coming over this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Otay mommy&quot; Dru said as she slid out of her bed and made her way to the bathroom naked. Once she was done her mother helped her get dressed. Today Dru was wearing a pair of pink panties with &quot;PRINCESS&quot; written in glitter on the front, a pink sun dress, and pink sandals with pink and white plastic flowers on the top.<br />
<br />
Dru's mother took her and the kit down to get some breakfast.<br />
<br />
Just as Dru finished her breakfast the doorbell rang. She went with her mother to answer the door.<br />
<br />
The woman at the door said &quot;Stacy, it's been so long since we last saw each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that the last time we saw each other was at graduation&quot; Stacy said. &quot;How are you Lisa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm good&quot; Lisa said. &quot;How are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm good&quot; Stacy said. &quot;Have you heard from Ryan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's just now starting to come to terms with what happened&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't want him to find out like that&quot; Stacy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you didn't&quot; Lisa said. &quot;It was just a shock to him to see you become your old male self for a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't fun for me either&quot; Stacy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can just about imagine&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I still haven't figured out why you changed like that instead of going back to your original reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That reminds me&quot; Stacy said. She reached into her pocket and asked &quot;Where did you get this Dru?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dru saw the ticket that she had received yesterday. &quot;I found it in da bafwoom&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Stacy smiled and said &quot;Don't want me to know what you wished for then. I'll tell you that your father and I had made a wish that we would have a daughter. Now we have you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wished to be a girl&quot; Dru said blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you satisfied with your wish?&quot; Stacy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh&quot; Dru answered.<br />
<br />
Just then the vixen kit came out of the kitchen and Lisa said &quot;Oh, you have a fox as a pet. I would have thought that you wouldn't have one as a pet considering that you're a were-fox.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She isn't a pet&quot; Stacy said. &quot;In fact she's the reason that I called you. I know that you're busy but this kit is going to become my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you're going to fully transform it?&quot; Lisa asked. &quot;You know that that's very tricky to do. Changing an animal into a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know but her whole family was killed by hunters last night&quot; Stacy said. &quot;They had her in a cage and they were going to kill her too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's terrible&quot; Lisa said. &quot;So what do you need me to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We need you to get us the proper paperwork&quot; Stacy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be difficult to get the paperwork on such short notice but I'll see what I can do&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Lisa&quot; Stacy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to know something&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Why didn't you continue with basketball after high school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After Ryan dumped me I just didn't feel like continuing&quot; Stacy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you change it if you could?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I wouldn't&quot; Stacy said. &quot;I'm happy with Jeremy and he accepts me even when I told him that I was a male in a different reality. Though I suspect that him having been female before has something to do with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm surprised he took your last name&quot; Stacy said. &quot;How is he anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's fine&quot; Stacy said.<br />
<br />
They chitchatted for a bit and Dru learned a little bit about her mother. She learned that not only had her mother been a male before and a basketball player in high school but how she came to be female. She had found a potion in her locker one day while she was changing for practice when she was still male. The note with it said to drink it if she wanted to take her team to state so she did. It ended up making her female in a different reality. She had gotten<br />
into magic at first to receive her memories that she was missing. After that she continued hoping that she could find a way back to her old life. By the time she found it she was happy and used to being female. When she met Jeremy and learned that he was a were-fox she researched how she could become a were-fox too.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Later that night after supper Stacy said &quot;It's about time. Let's get your clothes off Dru.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Dru asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we don't want to take the chance that your clothes will be ruined if you transform&quot; Stacy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Otay mommy&quot; Dru said as she started to take off her clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's get downstairs&quot; Jeremy said once he was naked.<br />
<br />
Dru carried the vixen kit down the stairs and into the secret room. Suddenly Dru felt the tingling that signaled her transformation. She focused on her human self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep in human form Dru&quot; Stacy said. &quot;The moon is up. It's time to make this kit a member of the family. Give her to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dru did as her mother told her. She was worried about the kit. Would she feel any pain from the transformation? How old will she be?<br />
<br />
&quot;Dru, you don't have to chant with us&quot; Stacy said. &quot;You just need to stand in the circle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dru looked at the floor around the altar and saw a circle etched into the floor there. She stepped into that circle as her mother put the kit on the altar.<br />
<br />
Stacy picked up a bottle and started pouring it's contents over the kit while chanting some words that Dru didn't understand. Jeremy was also chanting.<br />
<br />
The first change to happen to the kit was her fur receded into her body. Then her body started growing and her ears became rounder. Her muzzle shrank and human features formed. Her paws became hands and toes. Her legs gained some fat and muscle forming human arms and legs. Her tail shrank until it disappeared. Finally sandy brown hair grew out of her head and down past her shoulders. The kit had gone from a fox to a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's done&quot; Stacy said. &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange&quot; Dru's new sister said. &quot;Thank you for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome&quot; Stacy said. &quot;We couldn't just leave you to fend for yourself. Now we need to give you a name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee&quot; Dru said as she remembered a friend she had had when she was a young boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee Fox&quot; Stacy said. &quot;I like that. Thank you Dru.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Kaylee it is then&quot; Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to wear clothes?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you will&quot; Stacy said. &quot;It's a human law. On our property you really don't have to but it would be best if you do. That way you can get used to wearing clothes and you won't have to scramble to put on clothes when we get visitors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Kaylee said.<br />
<br />
Dru noticed something and said &quot;Mommy, I don't feel aww tingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come to think about it I don't feel like transforming either&quot; Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because we won't be able to transform until the next full moon&quot; Stacy said. &quot;It was part of the spell to give Kaylee time to adjust. Also the transformation used our transformation power and it needs to rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we have a month before we can transform again&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;Too bad. I wanted to go for a run tonight and tomorrow night. Oh well we have another daughter and that makes up for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now we need to find somewhere for Kaylee to sleep&quot; Stacy said. &quot;We could give her the guest room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can she sweep wif me?&quot; Dru asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please let me sleep with Dru&quot; Kaylee begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it will be ok&quot; Stacy said. &quot;After all you're only two years apart in age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Den dat means Kaylee is five&quot; Dru said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't be that old&quot; Kaylee said.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you were a fox you weren't&quot; Stacy said. &quot;Now that you're human you are five years old. We'll show you the house and then you can go to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Kaylee said.</p>
