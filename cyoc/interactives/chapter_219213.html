<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Irene put the bags down on the counter. It was odd, she swore that they were heavier when she got them out of the car, but now they felt rather light and easy to carry. She hefted the bag back up, watching as her bicep popped as she curled the 10-kilo weight a few times. It was practically weightless to her. She shrugged and put it back down, and went to unpack the groceries. Everything seemed normal, though the fridge and freezer didn&#39;t seem to be as cold as usual. Then, she got to the last tins in the bag and sighed. These were the ones that belonged on the top shelf, a place where she couldn&#39;t reach very well. She stood on her tiptoes, trying to stretch herself out a bit. With each passing moment, her hand grew closer and closer to the top shelf, until finally, she placed the groceries where they belonged. She nodded, satisfied with her work. Then, she looked down at herself.<br />
 <br />
Irene usually wore quite conservative outfits, all jumpers, and long t-shirts that left everything to the imagination. But she couldn&#39;t for the life of her remember why she chose to wear the one shirt that she could barely squeeze into. Her tan sweater rose above her midriff, showing her toned six-pack, clinging to her large breasts and stretched thin around her muscular upper arms. She was wearing her shortest sweatpants as well, which were only three-quarters in length rather than the full-length pants she usually wore. <em>What is going on with you, Irene?</em> she thought to herself. <em>You&#39;re 43, not 21.</em><br />
 <br />
Feeling cramped in her undersized shirt, Irene stretched up towards the ceiling, extending every vertebra in her spine until she felt her hands touch the roof. Somehow even more uncomfortable, Irene gave a furtive glance around to make sure that Jeff wasn&#39;t anywhere nearby, before trying something she&#39;d always secretly dreamed of doing. She bent her body down into a crab pose and focused on flexing every muscle in her body. They all burst to life, exploding in size, growing bigger and bigger until...<br />
 <br />
<em>RIIIIIIIP!</em><br />
 <br />
Not only her shirt, but her tight pants, were torn to shreds by her immense muscles. She stopped flexing, admiring her amateur bodybuilder physique, before looking at the tatters of her clothes on the ground. How she&#39;d even managed to get into them this morning was beyond her, but at least she&#39;d lived out one of her wildest dreams. Unfortunately, that had left her only in a threadbare bra, barely clinging to her huge chest with the last of its elasticity, and what once was her panties, now thin strips of fabric pulling tight into her pussy. Irene thrust her chest outwards, clenching her pectorals to push her breasts forward until the bra snapped off, freeing her chest from its prison. However, there seemed to be no way for her to get the far too-tight material out of her ass. Her panties were so tight they dug into the skin, and there was no way she could slide even a fingernail under it. She thought for a second, then decided to try and flex her ass and vagina. There was no hurt in trying, after all.<br />
 <br />
Irene focused intensely, pushing her glutes out larger and harder, feeling the muscle grow denser as she did so. Unfortunately, all that did was push the tight fabric between her brick-like buttocks. It was all down to her pussy, then. It was odd, trying to clench and flex her pussy outwards, but the longer she tried, the easier it seemed to get. Her vagina swelled, growing more and more muscular and creating a huge, bulbous mound as it did so. Finally, it grew so big that it stretched the fabric to the limit and shed her last scrap of clothing, leaving her stark naked. Irene patted her rock-solid boulder of a pussy. &quot;Knew you could do it, girl.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Unfortunately, just as she was admiring her handiwork, she heard the front door open. It was Jeff. Irene stared down at herself in horror. Her little Jeff couldn&#39;t see her like this! She had to escape, and quickly, but there was only one way out of the kitchen, and Jeff would be coming through it soon. She&#39;d be seen for sure. She ducked behind the kitchen bench and closed her eyes, praying that Jeff wouldn&#39;t see her like this.<br />
 <br />
Jeff walked through the door. &quot;Hey Mom, I&#39;ll just leave these on the kitchen counter, alright?&quot; When there was no reply, he shrugged and walked away. Irene breathed out a sigh of relief as her skin changed color, to a light pink for her embarrassment. She hated using her camouflage to hide from Jeff, especially after some of the incidents it had caused her in the past, but there wasn&#39;t any other option.<br />
 <br />
She sighed. After all the exhilaration of the afternoon and the erotic way she&#39;d shed her clothes, Irene couldn&#39;t help but feel a little horny. Down below, she felt her vaginal muscles clench and quiver, growling for attention. She smirked. She could definitely go for some alone time right now. The only problem now was how was she going to get to her room without being heard.<br />
 <br />
The stairs to the upper floor of the house were notoriously creaky. If Jeff heard, there would be no escaping his gaze. She needed another way to get there. If only she could fly… Except, of course she could, her leathery wings were perfect for it. Beating the black appendages, she easily lifted herself to the second floor, avoiding making any noise at all. Her large, strong wings folded onto her back as she crept inside her bedroom and shut the door.<br />
<br />
She laid down on the bed and plunged a hand into her needy snatch. Her thick muscle clenched tight around her hand as she teased her clit, thrusting her fingers in and out of her cunt. Her skin turned a deep purple from the lust. However, she wasn&#39;t satisfied. Her muscular breasts were completely ignored, but her nipples ached for attention. She squirmed and clenched her thick muscles until her second pair of hands came up to tweak her nipples and squeeze the hard flesh of her muscle boobs.<br />
<br />
As Irene fondled herself, she couldn&#39;t help but tease her clit out, pulling on it, gasping as it extended to its full foot-long length. She fondled her balls behind it, feeling the grapefruit-sized testicles slap against her thighs as she humped into the air with her 18-inch cock. Her nipples too, were teased to their full length, 12 inches of dick attached to her breasts. Precum began leaking from them, running down her pecs and through the grooves of her brickwork abs.<br />
<br />
With her hands now busy stroking her huge cock, Irene&#39;s pussy was still aching to be filled. She focused on it as she bent her prehensile tail around and lined it up with her entrance. She began lancing it in and out, the thin end of it sinking deep into her snatch. Hot cum spilled out, the smell was intoxicating to Irene. Her phallic tail struck again, the shaft of it so thick and girthy it made her cry out as she pounded her pussy again and again. Everything felt so good, every part of her filled to the brim with her cock tail, her mind filled with lust and erotic images. Her pheromones hung in the air, making her even hornier, and she couldn&#39;t hold it in. She moaned and shook, beating her wings against the bed as she fucked herself silly.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile…<br />
<br />
Jeff waited outside with the bags for a few minutes, to let the evolution proceed, then peeked back in to see how his mother was going. But, she wasn&#39;t in the kitchen. Nor was she in the living room, or the office. He was just about to call out when he heard some noises coming from upstairs. Muffled thumps and yelling echoed through the house. Cautiously, Jeff crept up the stairs. &quot;Mum?&quot; he called softly. &quot;Are you there?&quot;<br />
 <br />
As he got to the top, it became apparent that the noises were coming from his mother&#39;s room. Slowly, he stepped closer and closer, his calls becoming more tentative as his mind created terrifying and incredible scenarios about what could have happened to her. He opened the door. Whatever he had imagined, this wasn&#39;t it.<br />
<br />
His mother was splayed on the bed, two dark wings outstretched, her skin a vibrant purple that covered her thick, muscular frame. Four pairs of hands fondled herself, two for her breasts with nipples that looked extraordinarily like dicks, and two for her shaft that protruded just above her pussy, which Jeff realized dwarfed even his. All the while, a long, prehensile tail fucked her powerful, muscled vagina without mercy. Irine craned her head to look at her son and blushed, a light pink dusting her cheeks. &quot;O-oh, sooooorry dear,&quot; she moaned. &quot;I was just- oh! So pent up…&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff rushed back to the Chronivac, and looked at the settings. He wanted to slap himself. While he&#39;d set the transformation to 5000 years, it was 5000 years per second, accelerating her evolution massively. Not to mention, the environmental factor was only at 75%, meaning the rest of that 25% was controlled by her own thoughts and desires. He pressed stop quickly and rushed back to his mother.<br />
<br />
Cum had now painted every surface, and its pungent smell assaulted his nose the second he stepped into the room. Irene, who seemed unaffected by it, stood up to greet him, her skin back to a healthy human pink. &quot;I&#39;m sorry you saw all that, my dear,&quot; she murmured and brought Jeff in for a hug. With her new height, however, she just ended up squashing him between her muscle breasts. &quot;I&#39;m just always so horny, you know how I am. Tell you what, to make it up to you, I&#39;ll do anything you want for the rest of the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything?&quot; Jeff whispered. Irene nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, how about…&quot;</p>
