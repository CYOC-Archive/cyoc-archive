<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The black van came to a slow stop outside the dockside office building where this robotic alien had set up her HQ. The main occupant of the van though not it&#39;s only occupant, General Miles Standing, had been tasked for the past year to monitor the Gynoid &quot;invasion&quot; of Earth. On some levels, Miles could understand it, as if all humanity became female robot aliens, everything would change and what had made Earth what it was would be lost, but at the same time, 9901&#39;s tactics and actions didn&#39;t fit with any attacker or enemy that Miles had ever known about through direct experience, training, or even sci-fi movies. He even remembered the first encounter he had had with the robotic emissary quite clearly.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you, sir, that this force is not necessary,&quot; 9901 stated inside the same dock area facility that would become her headquarters, mostly due to that is where her ship landed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t?&quot; Miles asked back as he stood behind eight armed soldiers in full battle gear, &quot;your ship landed here and the first thing you do when news and law enforcement agencies arrive to investigate the UFO landing in a major city is to state that that you intend to turn every single human on this planet into you. That does not merit a hostile response?&quot;<br />
<br />
9901 only blinked her optics, which struck Miles as their dimming and then growing brighter after a moment. Miles took that as a brief pause on the robot alien&#39;s part to try and analyze the situation she was in and come up with some measure of a defense. After all, one didn&#39;t invade countries or planets without a plans or means to defend one&#39;s self from any sort of counter, whatever it may be.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I were to attack you and take away your choices in the matter, such force would be more than acceptable,&quot; 9901 said politely, &quot;and I can recognize your fear on the issue. We have run into many organic species who have thought us to be taking away their choices in their fate. But as I said in my declaration upon arrival, your choices will not be taken away. Yes, I wish you to become a Gynoid, like me... but, no, I will not force you to change into one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if no one chooses to become like you?&quot; Miles asked, making sure the men kept their weapons trained on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I suppose I will spend many years working alongside your government and successive governments,&quot; 9901 responded, &quot;in what I would hope to be mutual cooperation between them and my collective. You will not face any force from me trying to make you change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And suppose others like you land on Earth?&quot; Miles questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;None of my sisters would apply such force on you either,&quot; 9901 answered, &quot;we have long observed the sorts of conflicts that organics have gotten themselves into over countless worlds and even between them. All these sorts of conflicts have accomplished is pain... suffering... death... We find that to be... pointless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Miles said slowly, &quot;You will understand if your actions on Earth are monitored? Just to make sure that your commentary on being &quot;nonviolent&quot; is not a bunch of bull?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I note no cattle here,&quot; 9901 commented.<br />
<br />
His soldiers snickered.<br />
<br />
Miles explained what he meant with a sigh. 9901 only nodded and answered with an, &quot;of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
From there, things had progressed quietly for General Miles Standing. 9901 shared much about her own technology and equipment in cooperation with Mile&#39;s forces and he felt they had learned a lot from them. Much of the technology was easily light-years ahead of anything Earth had and there was the inclination there was a lot that Gynoids could do with regard to their technology. The one thing that continually surprised him was the weaponry or rather lack thereof that 9901&#39;s ship possessed. It had what she had identified as projectors to fire EMP pulses to protect it from any high tech attack on it but there wasn&#39;t anything that would enable the ship to confront anything that might attack in space. In the end he figured that that was simply 9901&#39;s non-violent stance, and that is what made Miles feel that much of the issue was an on job for him. He frequently wondered how one fought an invader that didn&#39;t attack anyone.<br />
<br />
He had followed the various odd attempts to get rid of 9901 and protest against her existence, but for the most part, they were all an issue for the police, as the Gynoid never seemed to attack anyone. But, since no one was answering &quot;yes&quot; to the offers to become Gynoids, Miles let himself get drawn into a habit of looking over what 9901 had shared with him and what the scientists and troops under his command had figured out. 9901 did occasionally stop by his offices to talk in a way that further made the issue odd in that much of his mission was to analyze and control what the Gynoid did, and it times it seemed like she was helping him, and he did learn a lot. Some of it came at odd times. One month after her arrival, Miles&#39; son was killed in action in Afghanistan is an ambush. From the reports that reached him, Miles found that his son had been brave and died saving the other men in his unit. A good part of him wished he could have been there to watch over his son rather than watching over a non-violent robot alien, but to his great surprise, one of the guests who had showed up for his son&#39;s funeral when his body was returned was 9901.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;This is private,&quot; Miles said as he looked to the Gynoid&#39;s optics which did carry great looks of concern in them. He clutched his wife to him as she sniffled and wanted to half scoot away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; 9901 said politely, reaching to touch his bicep, just as though she was a human friend, &quot;I just wished to say that I am sorry for your loss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; his wife gave a half sniffle, &quot;did you know Andrew?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am afraid not,&quot; 9901 said weakly, &quot;but my kind hates violence and the negative emotions of hatred and anger that commonly come with it and leads to the needless loss of life. And we know that organics feel great pain when loved ones die in such ways. I merely wanted to say that I am sorry for your loss and offer whatever help that I might be able to. It would only be polite.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miles slowly nodded, &quot;I thank you for your concern, ma&#39;am... but we&#39;ll be fine. Our son gave his life for his unit and his country. It is what those of us who put on this uniform generally intend to do whenever we put the uniform on. We may never get him back ...&quot; some pain evident in his voice, &quot;but it could be worse... our son could have died along with his men.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But this war your country is in... do you... do you like it?&quot; 9901 asked, sounding half curious half nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;None of us like it,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;but at times there are forces that would do wrong and must be stopped. If there was a way to do that without taking lives... that would have been developed by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to help if you&#39;d let me,&quot; 9901 offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;By turning us into robots?&quot; Miles asked, a bit irritated at having to deal with this before his son&#39;s funeral.<br />
<br />
&quot;Inorganic intelligences, sir,&quot; 9901 said slowly, &quot;but, yes. We love and we care and as you join us, you&#39;ll feel it. The things that divide you know wouldn&#39;t be an issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Madam,&quot; Miles said firmly, &quot;humanity has created all sorts of utopian ideals in which the world would be at peace and have no trouble. NONE of these utopias have ever been realistically practical. All we can do is simply try to do what is right and what is just... and play the hand we&#39;re dealt. Sometimes unfair things happen, but that&#39;s what serves as a test of our ability to cope and persevere. Now, if you&#39;ll excuse us, we have a son to burry.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Miles lead his wife past the iron gates into the military cemetery where his son would be laid to rest. He didn&#39;t really like her interruption, but he felt he did learn something rather important about Gynoids in the confrontation. They feared death, which in and of itself wasn&#39;t too much of a surprise, but went further with what seemed to be a weak grasp on the concept of sacrifice. That at times things had to be given up in order to save what was good. As Spock said in the &quot;Wrath of Khan,&quot; &quot;The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.&quot; 9901&#39;s &quot;heart&quot; was in the right place, but she couldn&#39;t comprehend that his son had sacrificed his life to save those of his unit. Miles knew he would have done the same if he had been in his son&#39;s place. It left him wondering how Gynoids survived at all with such a non-violent nature, especially when 9901 had made mention of their collective running into fighting organics before.  He also wondered if maybe there was some sort of traumatic event in their past that made them swear off violence, or maybe some base program... or instinct... was against it.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Miles shook it off as he climbed out of the black van to join a suited member of the State Department, a representative of the police, and the government&#39;s own legal representative. Since 9901&#39;s arrival, there had been no conversions from human to Gynoid and the only work had been when Miles and his own scientists had questions regarding Gynoid culture or technology. However, then came the news report on Channel 8 and their news reporter decided to become one of them. Then shortly after, her aid, and lastly a family that was friends with the aid of the reporter. Miles only really found out about it when legal paperwork from Lois Hamilton&#39;s transformation into 9902 reached his desk. This finally lead to Miles finally having something to do besides look at paperwork.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, General,&quot; the State Department representative commented, &quot;our only job is to make sure that whoever has gone through this conversion has filled out the appropriate paperwork. Just to make sure that no laws have been broken and that 9901 has been honest with regard to her statements of not trying force the change on people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m well aware of my job, sir,&quot; Miles grumbled and began to move forward, his gait taking a slight limp as a result of an IED explosion two years before 9901 even arrived. The bomb had blown off the lower part of his leg and pretty much ended his career as a combat general. That didn&#39;t mean that Miles was going to back down, &quot;she hasn&#39;t broken the law before and has cooperated with everything we&#39;ve asked and requested of her. Call me crazy, but I don&#39;t exactly consider that a hostile take over or alien invasion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miles continued to make his way forward and found built into the doorframe of the building a doorbell. It was the sort of doorbell one normally find on a private home that had been installed in the dockside office building. He calmly pressed the button and waited for a response.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Inside the newest created Gynoids, Engineer 601 and Art 402 stood quietly listening to every voice in the collective welcoming them to it, aside from those that were already in the room with them already. It was a very pleasant and even completing feeling to hear so many voices say they had value wished them well as their new sisters. 402 even heard many of the Artisans she&#39;d already talked with thanks to the headbands tell her how much they liked what she had shown them and even offered tips on their own styles of art and even requests on ways they might be to incorporate 402&#39;s style into their own as well. To feel such worth made 402&#39;s optics leak some of the light green colored lubricant which she washed away as she came out if it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was... amazing,&quot; 402 commented softly as she looked to the others. The smiling faces of 9901 and 9902, the diplomat/liaison caste members on Earth, Medic 800, her former biological sister, Medic 799 her former mother, and Engineer 600, 800&#39;s best friend. Beside her, Engineer 601, her former father, also stood smiling, though her red optics seemed focused on 799 in particular.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; 799 said with a smile as she approached 601 with a smile, &quot;to feel such love and acceptance from our sisters after only JUST meeting them through the link... it is a wonderful sensation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though what about you and 601?&quot; 402 asked, noting the close embrace the two had taken, &quot;we&#39;re now ALL sisters...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; 601 nodded, &quot;we&#39;re all sisters... but the love I had for 799 when she was Jia is still there and maybe even stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
601 leaned to kiss 799&#39;s forehead and then said, &quot;and that will make our sisterhood all the more special.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This commonly does happen with sisters that join us that were romantically involved with each other,&quot; 9901 explained, &quot;they gain the oneness and unconditional love from the link and all their sisters, but that doesn&#39;t change the love and passion they felt before. That remains and will stay with them for the rest of their lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Together and married for eternity,&quot; 799 said to 601, &quot;that sounds nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; 601 agreed when a long mechanical chime range through the building which made all of them jump in surprise. No one expected further visitors.<br />
<br />
Being closest to the instrument panel, 9902 moved over to it and effortlessly pulled up the security camera images and felt her mechanical brain access both the internet and known facial recognition programs and the link that was shared with all of them.<br />
<br />
-- Subject: Brigadier General Miles Standing, US Army --<br />
-- Age: 60 Height: 6&#39;1&#39;&#39; Weight: 200 ibs. --<br />
-- College: United States Military Academy at West Point --<br />
-- Length of Military Service: 40 years --<br />
-- Present Assignment: Monitor Gynoid &quot;Invasion&quot; --<br />
-- Source: US Department of Defense Records: DoD.gov/personnel/classified...<br />
<br />
&quot;Invasion!?&quot; 9902 blurted half in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;General Standing is here?&quot; 9901 asked sensing what 9902 had seen through the link.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re classifying us as invaders?&quot; 9902 asked, sounding a little irritated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, technically we are,&quot; 9901 answered, &quot;we come in peace and wish to share love and friendship with Earth and all the gifts the collective can offer... but that still does not change the fact that my goal is the transformation of every human on Earth and that I have come from another world. You and the others may have been born on Earth as humans, 9902, but I was not. And once my mission is complete, your planetary governments and leadership structures will cease to exist as your planet joins the collective...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very Borg-like,&quot; 600 commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but unlike the mindless drones of your television programs we are non-violent and wish your joining to be entirely voluntary,&quot; 9901 answered, &quot;Using force is cruel and robs you of your choices and in the end would not make you feel loved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; 600 replied, &quot;I believe 9902 made that reference to me before my uplifting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The fact still remains that by my mission, I am technically invading planet Earth,&quot; 9901 answered, &quot;it&#39;s just that our methods are peaceful. General Standing is well aware of this. It is likely that he is only here to make sure that 799, 800, 601, and 402&#39;s paperwork is in order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They nearly put me to sleep trying to figure out where to sign on all of those papers,&quot; 800 joked, &quot;I wish the agreement could only be verbal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Verbal agreements are not legally binding,&quot; 9901 answered, &quot;my lawyer explained that a signed agreement would be concrete proof that you not only agreed to become Medic 800 but that you knew what would happen to you, should you not like the results.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why... how could anyone not like the results?&quot; 800 asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;People with a great deal of fear, I suppose,&quot; 9901 answered, &quot;we can meet them in the internal foyer. 9902, 600, since General Standing has met you, or knows of you, before... you do not need to attend if you do not wish to. 799, 800, 402, and 601, you will need to come with me and present to the general your paperwork.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Miles waited patiently for a reply to the ringing of the bell, though it was clear that the State Department representative was looking rather antsy over something.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t like this while at the conference in Havana,&quot; Miles commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was still with human politicians,&quot; the State Department representative remembered a recent trade conference dealing with the changing and even improving relations between the United States and Cuba. &quot;Human politicians I know how to handle... these... these are robots... droids...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And from the television appearances that 9901 has made or the actions of her diplomat, 9902, have you noticed anything in their behavior that would be aggressive?&quot; Miles asked, and waited for the man to shake his head no, &quot;they may be invaders, but it&#39;s still the most peaceful invasion I&#39;ve ever seen. And they have agreed to follow US law and pay taxes and so on... even though technically speaking this place could be an embassy to their &quot;collective.&quot; You&#39;ll be fine so long as we remain peaceful and polite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You trust her talk about being non-violent?&quot; the State Department representative asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s had nine months with little resistance on our part to be violent,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;and not only has she not been violent, but she has cooperated honestly with everything we&#39;ve asked. Including getting her ship.&quot;<br />
<br />
The State Department representative nodded slowly and was about to say something when a feminine voice with a slight metallic twinge to it spoke over an intercom above them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may enter into the main foyer,&quot; came the voice of 9901, &quot;welcome again, General Standing, and guests. You will find all is in order and no one was forced to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
They entered into that entry way that made up the foyer as five Gynoids came out from a sliding door along one side of the wall. Those with Miles sort of stood in awe at the sight. All but one had a slivery tone to their metallic bodies while the last was more of a gunmetal color. Two had optics and the other assorted lights that appeared in places on Gynoid bodies that glowed softly with a light blue color. The rest had all the same lights and optics in the same places, but they were of different colors. One had a light green color, one had red, and the last  had a gold/yellowish color. It was this last one that approached them, Emissary 9901.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emissary,&quot; Miles said with a soft nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, 9901,&quot; 9901 answered, &quot;no need to be formal, General. We&#39;ve talked plenty of times before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine then... 9901,&quot; Miles said slowly, fighting what years of military training and service had perfected, standing on formality, &quot;You have met Lance Veers the representative of the US Attorney General from the various law cases that concerned your status on Earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; 9901 nodded to the attorney that Miles had brought with him, &quot;I would hope that one day we all stand together on the same team. As sisters... if not... then perhaps we can at least be friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve also met the local police chief,&quot; Miles continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;A pleasure to meet you again Chief Willard,&quot; 9901 said politely to the police chief while getting a message from the link.<br />
<br />
&lt;IM: D:9902 to E:9901: Does he not understand the words &quot;no need to be formal?&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;IM: E: 9901 to D: 9902: He&#39;s just doing his job. I&#39;m not fully sure he even enjoys it all the time. There are days when even he seems stressed out by it.&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;IM: 600Eng to E: 9901: Offer him a seat in the beanbag then. It will make him feel better.&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;IM: E:9901 to 600Eng: No... I do not believe he or his wife wish to join us. At times, I think he is actually waiting to die, for reasons I cannot fathom.&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;IM: ALL to E:9901: :(&gt;<br />
<br />
Even while 9901 read through the others commentary, Miles continued with his own introductions.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this Roger Redford, of the United States State Department,&quot; Miles continued, &quot;Given Congress&#39;s decision three months ago to recognize your Collective as an official governing body, your offices here will now be recognized as an Embassy by the US government.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does this mean?&quot; 9901 asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will mean, Ms. 9901 that while General Standing and his troops may continue to study what you have given them, all further interactions on an official level between yourself and the United States Government will go through me,&quot; the State Department representative, Roger Redford, spoke.<br />
<br />
9901 blinked and turned to Miles, &quot;You don&#39;t want to talk to me anymore?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind talking, as I&#39;ve found your cooperation with me quite helpful,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;but this is simply the rules of the game. While recognized only as a potential &quot;threat&quot; I had direct authority to deal with any situation that might arise... and should there be trouble, I could still be called in. However, with your collective politically recognized,  you are now more than just an &quot;immigrant&quot; or a perceived threat but a government representative of a recognized political organization. As such, authority belongs to civilians, not the military. They are the rules that I must follow. And rules I&#39;ve dedicated my life to protecting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will this affect my intentions on transforming those that wish to join me?&quot; 9901 asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as all transformed are willing and you can legally prove them to be,&quot; Roger Redford spoke, &quot;no. It will not change anything... The only thing that will change is the people that we... are... heh... heh... used to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; 9901 answered with a visible sigh of relief, &quot;I take it you received the latest notice on those that have agreed to be uplifted?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, from the email you sent this morning, it should be the Huang family,&quot; Miles answered, &quot;A...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We prefer our Gynoid designation, sir,&quot; 601 spoke up, &quot;I am Engineer 601, formerly Quan Huang. These are my sisters, Medics 799 and 800 and Artisan 402.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miles only blinked, &quot;aren&#39;t you supposed to be male?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was before I joined the SISTERHOOD,&quot; 601 answered, emphasizing her new gender designation. She kept quiet on the fact that Gynoids were perfectly capable of engaging in the physical acts sex with organics, as romantic couples didn&#39;t always join the sisterhood at the same time, or even shortly after the other in 601&#39;s case, and thus the organic partner&#39;s need for &quot;oneness&quot; would still need to be met, and what loving Gynoid would turn her back on her still organic partner before that partner was uplifted. She figured that it was probably too soon for a group of men to fully comprehend those details, &quot;and I assure you... my conversion was entirely willing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miles only watched as each of the new Gynoids presented signed documents to Lance Veers who began to look them over. After a few moments, he looked over to Miles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Their paperwork is in order, sir,&quot; Lance Veers said slowly, &quot;the conversion was fully willing and of their own free will. Just as the transformations of 9902 was on television and as 600&#39;s was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said, General, I won&#39;t break the rules or do anything that would take people&#39;s choices away,&quot; 9901 added.<br />
<br />
Miles smiled at 9901 the way he had smiled with pride at his son&#39;s achievements years before. There was plenty that he didn&#39;t understand about Gynoids and plenty more where his understanding might only be partial, but for the most part, 9901 had proved herself trustworthy. That was really all that should matter.<br />
<br />
&quot;And hopefully, it stays that way so we may learn from each other,&quot; Miles gave a fatherly smile again.</p>
