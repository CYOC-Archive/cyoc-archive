<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took time but eventually James began to understand where his new vague sense was coming from. First, he realized that he only had the <br />
sense when he wore the bike shorts. Second, it began to seem like a communication of some kind. He couldn't fully understand it because it <br />
was like listening to someone shouting from far away. But he did begin to understand a little bit.<br />
<br />
He was freaked out at first but then decided that he had gotten some special bike shorts and as soon as he could find his brother, he wanted to <br />
find out how John had gotten ahold of such shorts. But John had disappeared and no one knew where he went.<br />
<br />
The family had panicked and the police did an investigation. At first, the theory was kidnapping but the cops couldn't find any evidence of foul <br />
play. Instead, the evidence looked like John had just decided to travel. He hadn't left any note or clue where he was going but it looked like he <br />
had packed and sold some of his possessions before he disappeared. James felt a little angry that John would leave without saying anything but <br />
James figured that he'd come back eventually, wherever he was.<br />
<br />
As for the shorts, James grew to enjoy the vague sensation of communication from the bike shorts. It had caused him headaches but only <br />
because he had tried to shut out the noise. When he listened, it wasn't so unpleasant. He even began to understand what the shorts said. He <br />
didn't hear words of course but he began to recognize that the shorts sounded a certain way when they were dirty and they made a different <br />
sound when stretched abruptly. So James assumed that the bike shorts were equipped with some sort of sensing equipment. James only wished <br />
he hadn't thrown the instruction manual away because the shorts often made noise that James hadn't learned to understand yet.<br />
<br />
From John's perspective, he had gotten used to things for a while. There wasn't anything he could do anyway. He figured that he may as well <br />
support his brother as best he could while he was stuck there. His brother's jack off sessions had taken the longest to get used to but John had <br />
even accepted that. At first, he had tried to manipulate his brother's cock to prevent the problem but his efforts only made the problem worse. <br />
Then he allowed it to happen and found that he was beginning to enjoy it some. His own cock was constantly between his brother's ass cheeks <br />
being rubbed with each push of a pedal so whenever James went riding his bike, John got an orgasm too. (James thought it strange that some <br />
cum kept showing up on his ass under the shorts.) Finally one day when James was really working out, John relaxed and let the cock in.  It <br />
wasn't till later that John realized where his brother's cock was. James seemed to want to repeat the experience and tried different ways to get <br />
his cock in the right spot in the special bike shorts until finally John got used to this regular invasion as well.<br />
<br />
James went off to college and met his new roommate.<br />
<br />
Tom said, &quot;I already know who you are. How do you like the bike shorts?&quot;<br />
<br />
James asked, &quot;You know about them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom answered, &quot;I helped arrange to make a Merry Christmas for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
James said, &quot;Thanks, they're wonderful. Do you know what happened to John?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom answered, &quot;As a matter of fact I do.<br />
<br />
James accused, &quot;Why didn't you say anything sooner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom said, &quot;Relax, I'll explain. John is perfectly fine and you can talk with him anytime. He joined a club that required him to keep silent for a <br />
while but that will soon change.&quot;<br />
<br />
James asked, &quot;Well, where is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom said, &quot;He's closer than you realize.&quot;<br />
<br />
James said, &quot;Enough with the riddles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom said, &quot;He's on your ass right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
James looked at Tom for a moment and then blurted, &quot;You're sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then John began to change back part way. He turned skin tone in color. He began to thicken and grow hair. James felt a cock thicken in his <br />
crack and flesh form around his cock. Pretty soon a bulge formed on the front of the bike shorts and became John's head.<br />
<br />
Tom said, &quot;Next Christmas, you'll have your brother back under the Christmas tree as your Christmas present. He'll be naked of course and as <br />
soon as you plunge your cock in his ass, he'll be your bike shorts again. You will let him spend a few moments with the family before you wear <br />
him again won't you. He won't get to be human very much for another five years. But if he's not on your ass, I'll have to find someone else to <br />
wear him.&quot;</p>
