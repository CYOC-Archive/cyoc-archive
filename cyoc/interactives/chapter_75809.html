<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Let’s go to a bar!” Colette suggested.  “One of those trendy, hard to get into places.  You can always wish <br />
us in if there’s a problem.”<br />
<br />
I liked that idea.  “Sure, why not?  Maybe we can read a few thoughts while we’re there,” I said.<br />
<br />
Fortunately we appeared like a normal couple.  Our fangs were hidden and before we had left the castle I <br />
finally remembered to wish my fingernail back to normal.  I sensed that Colette wanted to use her fangs, so I <br />
had to keep a sharp wit to make sure nothing drastic occurred.  <br />
<br />
We found our way to a place called “Studio Blue.”  We’d both heard of this place from other people.  It was <br />
rumored to be the place you just had to be if you were hip.  There was a huge line waiting to get in.  The <br />
door to the place didn’t appear to be anywhere in sight.  “Oh, Chris, it’s so crowded,” Colette pretended to <br />
whine.  “Now what are we going to do?”<br />
<br />
I looked at her and rolled my eyes.  “Don’t overdo it too much,” I said.  “Someone might think you’re weird.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not concerned about that,” she said.  “Once they see me, I’m pretty sure they’ll be distracted.”  It <br />
didn’t take much to know what she meant by that.<br />
<br />
We bypassed the huge line in search of the bar’s entrance.  We found it and, sure enough, there was a bouncer <br />
at the door with a list in his hand.  He allowed a few people in who were apparently on the list.  The line of <br />
people behind the rope looked more and more annoyed.  He saw us and just asked, “Name?”  I guess he wasn’t <br />
impressed by Colette’s outfit.  <br />
<br />
“Chris Grant and Colette Niven,” I said.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw Colette with a questioning look on <br />
her face.<br />
<br />
The bouncer scanned over the 3 pages of his list.  “Not here, man, so you’ll have to get in line,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, man, are you sure?” I asked in a pitiable voice.  “I wish we were on the list.”<br />
<br />
“Well, you’re not, so come on, stop holding me up,” he replied.<br />
<br />
“I wish you’d look again,” I said.<br />
<br />
The bouncer looked both annoyed and confused.  “Fine,” he said.  He went over the list again.  He was on the <br />
second page when he did a double take.  “Chris Grant and Colette Niven?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“That’s us,” I said.<br />
<br />
“I know your names weren’t here a minute ago, but now they are,” he said.  The look of disbelief on his face <br />
told me that he questioned his eyes.<br />
<br />
“I wish you wouldn’t worry about it,” I said.<br />
<br />
The expression on his face normalized and he opened the door for us.  “Step right in,” he said.  <br />
<br />
“Thank you,” I said.  Colette took my arm with a smile and we walked in.  We soon found out why this place was <br />
called “Studio Blue.”  The lighting in the place was entirely blue.  It made everything look blue.  It was a <br />
little odd to my eyes.  The place was also thumping and pounding with the overly loud sound of bass coming <br />
from the speakers.  “Can you hear me OK?” I asked Colette in a raised voice.<br />
<br />
“What?” she asked, her voice also raised.  I was about to ask the question again but Colette’s smile told me <br />
that she was joking.<br />
<br />
We were shown to a table that was close to one of the corners of the entire bar.  That was fine with me since <br />
it allowed us to be away from some of the loud speakers.  It also allowed us to somewhat oversee the entire <br />
bar.  After a couple of minutes, a waitress approached us.  She also had to raise her voice in order to be <br />
heard.  “Hi, I’m Rose.  What can I get for you?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, gee, I don’t know,” said Colette.  “Is there a menu or something?”<br />
<br />
The waitress looked a little confused.  “You haven’t been here before, have you?”<br />
<br />
“No,” I answered.  “Tell you what.  Can you just bring us two glasses of your best red wine?”<br />
<br />
“No problem,” she said.  “Can I just see your ID’s?”<br />
<br />
It occurred to me that we didn’t have our ID’s with us.  Time to simplify things.  “Oh, I wish you knew that <br />
we’re over 21.”<br />
<br />
“Never mind, I know you’re OK,” she said.  “Be right back with those.”<br />
<br />
“Quick thinking,” said Colette.  “But, Chris, I don’t know if I like red wine.  I’ve never had it.”<br />
<br />
I smiled at her.  “Neither have I,” I said.  “Just trust me,” I said with a wink.<br />
<br />
“Did you notice anyone looking at me when we came in?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“No, sorry, can’t say that I did.  Too distracted by…well this whole place,” I said as I gestured with my <br />
hands.  “What’s the appeal of a place like this?”<br />
<br />
“It’s built by someone who’s popular,” said Colette.  “So anything that person does is trendy.  You get into a <br />
trendy place like this, you just have to be cool.”<br />
<br />
“So…it’s all bullshit?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She shook her head.  “If you think like that, sure,” she said.  “But if you believe that stuff, then this <br />
fulfills a lot of your ambitions.”<br />
<br />
“Something tells me that you like this place,” I said.<br />
<br />
“A little bit,” she said.  “It’s too loud and too big.  I like places that are more…intimate.”<br />
<br />
At that point Rose returned with our wine.  “Here you two go,” she said.  “Need anything else?”  We shook our <br />
heads.  “I’ll be back to check on you.  If you need me, just yell and hopefully I’ll hear it.”<br />
<br />
Colette just looked at her wine.  “So what’s you’re game?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“I wish that our wine was actually blood, but that it would still appear to be wine to everyone but us,” I <br />
said.  Instantly we could see the wine change in color and texture.  Colette eagerly picked up her glass.  <br />
“Whoa, whoa,” I said.  “You can’t just gulp that down,” I warned her.  “You have to sip it, slowly.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” she asked.  “No wonder people make fun of wine drinkers.”  She did as I instructed, however, slowly <br />
pulling up the glass to her lips and sipping it.  She took a few sips and then carefully placed down the <br />
glass.  “Wow,” she said.  “This sounds so fucked up, but that is so good.”<br />
<br />
“Now you understand why I had to wish for control over bloodlust,” I said.  “It’s a taste that you acquire a <br />
bit too easily.”<br />
<br />
“That reminds me,” Colette said as she took another sip.  “Why didn’t you give me that power to shape shift?”<br />
<br />
“Um…” I said since I didn’t have a better answer.<br />
<br />
“I mean, you said we’re equals, so why didn’t you give me that power?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Honestly,” I said.  “I don’t know.  Fear, I suppose.”<br />
<br />
She gave me an odd look.  “Afraid of what?  Me using that power?” she asked.<br />
<br />
I shrugged my shoulders.  I said, “I guess.  I mean, I wasn’t sure how you might react to it.  I don’t want to <br />
have control over you, and I didn’t know if you might do something rash.”  She did not appear to be satisfied.  <br />
“Look, do you want that power?”</p>
