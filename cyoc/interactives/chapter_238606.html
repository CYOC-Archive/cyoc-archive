<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the pressure of someone else in his arms he noticed first, James comfortable in the greater mass by now and instead opening his eyes to look down. His view consisted of his huge pecs, Miles cuddled up in his cannon of an arm, and furthest down one of the worst cases of morning wood he&#39;d ever had.<br />
<br />
However long they&#39;d been asleep had let the sun start to rise on what was looking to be a beautiful Sunday. James gave a stretch and squeezed Miles gently, getting a smile out of him just like their last waking before he delicately gets up, able to set him down with ease where he curled up into the warm space James had left in the sheets.<br />
<br />
James slipped into the closet to look for something to cover his manhood, his eyes going around before spotting a robe dangling from a hanger and yanking it off, getting it on and tightening it up, pivoting to get a look of himself in a mirror set up in the closet in a bit of surprise. The robe he&#39;d picked was what Miles had been wearing on their first night.<br />
<br />
Gently cupping a pec before his grip went more aggressive and pulled at his nipple, a deep moan came from the big man. It was so much of a rush to see and feel the whole thing until James blinked and saw the ring on the hand he&#39;d been feeling himself up with which he focused on for a bit before slipping it off. He looked back to Miles still snoozing in bed in thought before looking back into the expansive closet.<br />
<br />
It took a bit of rooting around for a satisfying hiding place until he found an opened unoccupied safe concealed behind a rack of dress pants. Probably for valuables, James thought, impressed at the door&#39;s thickness and weight, swinging it back a few times to test it.<br />
<br />
Figuring for the sake of avoiding anything like last time that this was an acceptable place for them to stash it, he set the ring inside and set the safe shut, spinning the dial a few times to be sure it was good and secure, giving the handle a few good yanks.<br />
<br />
Satisfied the ring was safe, the big hand actually felt a bit off without the accessory, driving James to keep looking through Miles closet, coming across different suits and shelves within drawers he must have collected over the years without putting on so much as once.<br />
<br />
One of the drawers was full of heavy accessories like chains and rings, one particular band looking reasonably similar to the swapping ring sans emerald which James slipped on and made a fist, undoing his robe and returning to the mirror to get a look at himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn...,&quot; James couldn&#39;t help but saying upon seeing himself in the mirror, his huge case of morning wood still out in the air, the ringed hand heading straight back to get a grip on his pec. The grip only got his wood worse and his breath shallow, but instead of trying to relax he just rolled one of the sleeves up to flex the bicep in the mirror, making a pose and flashing a grin. The muscle monster was getting way too off on himself at this point, his free hand getting a grip of his cock&#39;s base and giving a hard squeeze, pre oozing out like a faucet.<br />
<br />
James snorted and milked up his healthy equipment to get all the clear goodness out and onto those big hands, bringing them up to lick them clean, still tasting as good and salty as they had from his old body&#39;s mouth. Getting his grip back on his cock out of reflex, the horned up beefcake kept looking himself up and down in the mirror, wanting to try flexing his pecs again.<br />
<br />
The first flex took a similar amount of effort as the first time he&#39;d tried it, having to move the muscle slowly with immense concentration. Getting it flexed though, he relaxed and tried the other with similar results. This had to be repeated a few times over a few slow minutes, but James eventually figured out the actions and the how. Soon, he was giving himself a perfect popping pec dance and smiling widely, mesmerized by his huge muscles and getting better with his mind muscle connection.<br />
<br />
Whether he&#39;d admitted it to himself or not, he&#39;d already been hooked on this body when he&#39;d woken up. Now it was this body&#39;s turn to get hooked on him, that manhood starting to throb and express a vein with no grip on it whatsoever. He was so jazzed he almost missed the sight of Miles leaning on the door frame with a smile, enjoying the show, seizing up instantly after spotting his boss.<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh.... I.....&quot; James stammered, swallowing and turning around as he turned red. &quot;Lookin&#39; big, sir,&quot; Miles said with a smirk. That three letter word again was all it took for that fluster to drain back out, James puffing his chest back out and stepping over, radiating heat and reaching over to run his fingers through Miles ginger locks. Miles&#39;s eyes fluttered and he leaned in to James chest to take a contented sigh before burying himself deep to get a good whiff of his body&#39;s scent. Picking it up from another point of view was so much easier, Miles&#39;s throat getting tight the deeper he breathed it all in.<br />
<br />
James shivered in response, letting Miles breathe deep and rub his face on his chest to get that whiff of his man stink, stroking his hair and squatting down to hoist him up by that bubble butt. &quot;Think we&#39;ve still got a shower to take, shamrock,&quot; James said, Miles being the one to tense up this time after being addressed in such a way. James gave him a kiss on the cheek before hoisting him over his shoulder and kicking the bedroom door open to strut back down the hallway, returning to the luxurious bathroom they&#39;d shared just hours ago.<br />
<br />
Getting princess carried through his own house was definitely something new that Miles could go for at least a few more times, getting a good view of James back and ass while draped over his shoulder while also getting his own rear groped up. Even if they were playing parts, the bodies they were in were taking to it all like fish to water, the matter of them being in each other&#39;s bodies not even registering. Miles was in a flustered awe at the beast of a bear handling him like he weighed nothing while James leaked pre with every step at the thought of his eager little twink getting pumped with his power and virility.<br />
<br />
Eventually returning to the bathroom James took a squat to get the hot water running once more without even putting Miles down. Not that James had any plans to, happy squeezing and playing with that butt slung over his boulder shoulder, getting wriggling and restrained laughing from Miles. He was getting tickled and teased by a man that would be getting even rougher soon. While Miles wouldn&#39;t have taken that treatment for a second weeks ago, all he wanted now was more. That little intern he&#39;d wined and dined at the start of all this was getting more stud like by the second, and Miles couldn&#39;t be happier being all his.<br />
<br />
James meanwhile seemed to be looking around for something, dropping down to go through the cabinets and eventually returning with a bottle of oil that he popped open and drizzled on his cock. Pumping himself a few times he made sure to spin so as to let Miles have a look at what he was up to before he brought that same hand up to his rear, slipping past and fingering with the aim to ease him up. Miles hadn&#39;t been expecting that much prep this soon but he didn&#39;t struggle, letting his rim get pushed and worked by those thick fingers, shivering and getting harder himself while he&#39;s prepped.<br />
<br />
Steam filling the room indicated the water was hot enough, James relaxing his fingering and getting Miles back on his feet who stumbled a few times. Stepping up behind him and getting his arms around him, James gave his biceps a flex at Miles&#39;s sides with his hands snug against the twink&#39;s front, grinding his lubed up cock to let him feel the time he was about to have, getting a gasp from Miles with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;S....sir....&quot; he said with a bit of genuine timidity, able to get a hand on his. &quot;Shower. We&#39;ve got some things to take care of,&quot; the big man said to his little partner, who nodded before walking forward into the shower.<br />
<br />
The water was at a warm and soothing temperature, getting a contented sigh from the bottom who closed his eyes for the several seconds he had before his dominant lover joined and got his hands back around his waist, lining that lubed up cock into that tight ass, one hand going further to spread on a leg while the other went up to push on his lower back. The hairy mountain was breathing slow in contrast to the shuddering throb his meat was pushing, trying to be patient while his needs roared on the inside to get on with it. ALL of this was his.<br />
<br />
&quot;No swapping this time. This load&#39;s all yours. Just like how you&#39;re all mine, shamrock,&quot; the beefcake said low and seductively, the smaller man swallowing with wide eyes, his breaths getting shorter, biting his lip. &quot;Please,&quot; he was able to say, his hungering body wanting too much of that bigger body, needing the bigger stronger male too much now.<br />
<br />
The big guy started pushing down on his bottom&#39;s lower back and tightening his hold of his waist when he started pushing himself past his edge, continuing his patience with the intent of letting his bottom savor every second without bringing one bit of harm.<br />
<br />
The warm water felt hot and the air felt heavy with the steam rising while the smaller man stumbled, feeling himself getting stretched and penetrated by this monster, waving his hand about and able to grip a shower rail, the other one finding the wall, his toes curling out while he groaned.<br />
<br />
Once the surprise subsided, he started to push back, wanting more. It was everything he&#39;d visualized and then some. But the big man&#39;s grip was stronger, not letting his twink push and escalate.<br />
<br />
&quot;So eager for your man?&quot; the brute teased, squeezing his thigh and rubbing the hand spread out on his lower back in a massaging circle, getting a whimper from the catcher. &quot;If you&#39;re gunning for a raise you&#39;re off to a good start.&quot; The twink&#39;s cock shivered and dribbled pre at the treatment, needing to swallow and try pushing again only to fail again at the big man&#39;s strength.<br />
<br />
The huge meat only kept its slow advance in while the big guy made himself at home up his bottom&#39;s ass, giving his manhood a teasing flexing the further he gets in there. The smaller man moaned and arched his back from the shivers that advancing length put through him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;ve been good so far. Guess I can give you some slack,&quot; he eventually said, taking a deep breath. There was a third of a way to go, until the one in control gave a raw drive and dropped the rest of himself past, vanishing up his twink&#39;s hungry rear, this last penetrating hump quickly joined with a sharp spank.<br />
<br />
The two in tandem got the twink to shout and fire off into the running water immediately, his head spinning from the sensation. His ass burned and stung, his body felt weak in its subservience, and he was an animal in absolute heaven, firing again, too overstimulated to give a reply.<br />
<br />
The muscle man hadn&#39;t cracked once during all of this, prodding and playing his toy&#39;s body like an instrument for his own amusement. &quot;Mm.. good boy,&quot; he says, the thinner man whimpering and smiling from the shivers the statement sent up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for you big man&#39;s sugar, shamrock?&quot; he asked, giving a slow hump when he asks. The bottom can only manage a nod and what might be a stammered &quot;G...gently,&quot;, water running down his head by now, that small body a wrecked mess of pleasure by now.<br />
<br />
The mountain takes a breath, looking like he doubled in size before he gives that ass of his its first driving pound. The huge cock deep inside is just where the heat starts, taking up so much space the smaller man feeling it hit his skin in an instant, his eyes widening while he stumbled slightly forward, the side of his face making contact with the cold shower wall.<br />
<br />
The driving bigger man was just getting started, using the wall contact to get faster with his humps, getting both hands on that delicious rear to squeeze it together around himself as he gets more aggressive, his needs getting worse while the bottom moans and even drools into the running water.<br />
<br />
In a frenzy the hairy beast relaxes his grip in order to let out a double handed slap to the ass he&#39;s aggressively driving around, the owner yelling and moaning again before he gives off another hands free shot into the running water.<br />
<br />
The beefcake moans back what might have been another bout of degrading were it not for how bad the pressure had built by now, skin red with tension and hot water before one hump runs with a rush of heat, finally overflowing.<br />
<br />
The top unloads with his own broad back arching, feeling like a stream of heat spreading up the bottom whose eyes rolled into the back of his head at the feeling, the dreams and fantasies unable to compare to even one drop of the other man&#39;s load filling him up. What was only about thirty seconds or so felt like eons for both men until the flood relaxed to a trickle, the session they&#39;d both been secretly imagining finally coming to a close with the warm water still running.<br />
<br />
Needing at least a bit of time to recover without even separating as they caught their breaths, James was eventually able to get his hands back on Miles&#39;s butt and squeeze them together, squeezing himself of anything lingering until he popped free, not spilling a drop. Miles nearly collapsed forward were it not for James reacting and sweeping him back up, swinging him into a cradling. Miles looked dazed as James pushed wet hair out of his face to smile back and squeeze him close, not short on stamina as he could see his still full sized cock throbbing below. Miles however seemed to be passing out, his small body awash with pleasure, cuddling up to James&#39;s pecs and nuzzling, his innards warm with the load he&#39;d been hungering for. It was all his.</p>
