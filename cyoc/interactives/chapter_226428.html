<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few months ago, Emma had found an old archive of her grandmothers photographs. They were well-preserved, and it filled Emma with joy to see someone she looked up to looking so much like herself. She cherished the photos, coming back to them often.<br />
However, one day while looking through them, she found that some dates were missing.<br />
Intrigued, Emma made her way up to the attic and searched around, until she uncovered a small envelope. It was sealed and had a peculiar weight to it, but on the front were the exact dates that were missing.<br />
Emma brought the envelope back to her room, where she carefully opened it. She founds collection of photographs tied up with a bow, and a small vial of what appeared to just be… water?<br />
There was a small note written on the collection of images, which read,<br />
“Photographs from the Great Wishing Spring, and a Bottle of the Spring’s Water (don’t use all at once)”<br />
<br />
Emma wondered whatever this could mean. She decided to simply untie the photos and take a look.<br />
Upon folding over the first image, her eyes widened. It was of her grandmother standing in a beautiful Water Spring… but she was over eight feet tall! Standing beside Emma’s grandfather. It was bizarre.<br />
She turned over the next photo to find her grandmother having grown even taller, towering over her fiancé. She continued to look through the photos.<br />
They all featured her grandmother, or her friends in all kinds of transformed states. One of them all with large pregnant bellies, then next where they were all tall, then all with hourglass figures, then all tiny, and even one with them all transformed into men!<br />
Emma was fascinated, continuing to look through these photos over and over, becoming obsessed with the idea of a magic spring that could supposedly grant wishes!<br />
Then she caught the glimmer of the small vial. She smirked, grabbing it quickly, pulling the cork off the top and staring at the water inside. It appeared normal, but she was unsure of how to ‘use’ it.<br />
She placed her hand on top of the bottle, turning it over to let the water touch her hand. She then flipped it back over, allowing one drop of water to cascade down her hand. It felt soft. Silky.<br />
<br />
Staring at it, Emma muttered, “I wish I was bigger.”<br />
She watched the water as it quickly sank into her skin. She felt the same soft travelling all over her body, letting out a deep sigh of comfort before quickly her body started to stretch. She wasn’t growing taller or wider, indeed she was simply growing larger! She quickly stood off her bed, standing on the ground, seeing the world shrinking the tiniest bit as she got bigger! She was loving it… until it stopped.<br />
She looked down. Her tank top was slightly tighter, revealing her cute midriff a tiny bit. Her baggy shorts were still baggy, but a little tighter. She must’ve been at least four inches taller.<br />
She took the vial again, using the same technique she watched as the bead of water ran down her arm. It was so satisfying to watch, “I wish I was bigger again!”<br />
Again, her body started to grow, getting bigger in all directions. She watched as her room got smaller, her clothes got tighter, and she felt more and more aroused. She looked up, noticing how the ceiling was getting closer. Her room wasn’t the tallest in the world, and at this rate she wouldn’t even be able to stretch comfortably. She kind of hoped it would stop somewhat soon. She grew and grew until her head was at least a foot away from ceiling… a few more inches before eventually it stopped. <br />
She looked around, everyone looked so tiny. Her desk chair could hardly fit her body, let alone her hips. She smirked at the thought. She looked down, her shorts were completely hugging her lower half, and her tank top looked more like a crop-top hugging her breasts. She only noticed now that the pleasure was gone, but her bra was remarkably uncomfortable. She reached around and unhooked it, causing it to ping back. She held it up, noticing just how much smaller it was. She giggled excitedly.<br />
<br />
Emma bent down and grabbed the vial. She repeated the same manoeuvre, but this time a few extra drops of the liquid ran down her arm. She smirked as she made her wish, “I wish I had a curvy hourglass figure!”<br />
She watched to her surprise as all three drops sank into her skin. She almost moaned with pleasure as they all travelled inside her body.<br />
Immediately her waist narrowed, then her hips began to widen. She felt her bones stretching along with her skin. Her ass started to grow as well, finally causing her shorts to split right down the middle, revealing panties. Her thighs seemed to swell too, splitting the shorts a little more.<br />
But while this was happening, Emma was more focussed on what was going on up-top. She let out a sigh of pleasure as she felt her breasts swelling. Not only that, but her nipples seemed to be getting a little bigger (and more sensitive) too. Her breasts swell from their original B Cup to a C, then a D. They became fuller and rounder as well as larger, causing her stretched tank-top to act as support for them. They stopped around a large D cup, appearing quite large.<br />
Emma looked down, seeing her body having swelled to the voluptuous, curvy, hourglass shape she would’ve never believed remotely possible.<br />
She smirked, excited to see what her Boyfriend would think about this absurdly sexual body. <br />
<br />
She leaned down to grab her cell phone, but in doing so she managed to knock over the vial!<br />
“SHIT!” She yelped, watching the water quickly spilling onto the carpet below. Her hand dashed to try and catch it, only managing to grab save a small handful of the liquid. All the water that had spilt onto the ground evaporated almost instantly, a quick cloud of white steam appearing before quickly disappearing.<br />
Emma began to panic, her hand dripping small amounts of the water onto the floor as she stood there. She couldn’t hold it forever, and the vial was too small to pour the water back into with just her hands.<br />
She had no other choice than to use it…<br />
<br />
She didn’t know what to wish for… she couldn’t figure it out. If it made sense, the amount of water in her hand was more than enough for just one wish… so maybe she could wish for more than one thing. But then if she was wrong, then she’d have wasted one wish. She didn’t know what to do! Then she had an idea. Something simple.<br />
“I wish I knew what to wish for!”<br />
The water in her hands seemed to glow very slightly before it went back to normal. She felt the same sensation of the water travelling inside her body. It wasn’t as powerful, so she assumed it only used a little bit of the water. But then she was hit with her wish. What to wish for!<br />
<br />
“I wish I knew the exact location of the Great Wishing Spring!”<br />
<br />
The remaining water in her hands quickly vanished. The feeling was unreal. It was as if thoughts and knowledge were travelling all over her body! Emma closed her eyes to let out another pleasurable sigh before they opened. She was immediately blessed with the exact location of the Great Wishing Spring where her Grandmother had taken those photographs. She could picture it in her mind perfectly.<br />
She quickly grabbed her phone, finding her boyfriend’s number and called him.<br />
<br />
“Hey? You okay?”<br />
“Tomorrow, we’re going on a road trip!”</p>
