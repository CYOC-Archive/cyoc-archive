<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Very funny mom. But seriously, its weird thinking that you could almost be my older sibling, and a little unsettling that the first thing you do is remove the entire timespan I existed and then some from your personal history. Should I be worried?&quot; Jeff tried to play it off as a joke but he was shocked to see what his mom had done, and was a little nervous.<br />
<br />
Jamie looked shocked and hurt for a moment but thought about what Jeff was saying. &quot;I&#39;m sorry my appearance concerned you and you&#39;re absolutely right. I&#39;m not going to be focused on finding a 45-50 year old man looking like this and a 23-27 year old probably wouldn&#39;t want to be the step father of a 16 year old.&quot; Jamie bit her lip considering her words before continuing. &quot;I guess, I owe you a big thank you for pointing out what I was doing. I didn&#39;t see it till you said something but its actually really obvious now, and no, you shouldn&#39;t be worried, I love you and we are family!&quot; She said with a light chuckle lightening the mood. &quot;There will always be room in my heart for you! Hold on and I&#39;ll change things around again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff breathed a huge sigh of relief as Jamie turned to go back to his computer. He was fine that she didn&#39;t say &quot;turn things back to normal&quot; Jeff didn&#39;t want to stop her from having fun and making changes after all, he just expected them to be geared more towards family goals than personal goals...<br />
<br />
Around 30 minutes later Jeff had retreated to the couch and had been absorbed by an app on his phone. Jamie sauntered in looking every bit the radiant beauty she had been the first time, but now her wardrobe had been upgraded to an extravagant dress that bedazzled with every step she took. &quot;My god, Mom, You&#39;re breathtaking.&quot; Jeff stammered in shock. Jamie blushed, &quot;Aww, thank you Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff collected himself, &quot;I thought you were going to go back to being a little bit older... you know... to find someone that could help complete the nuclear family. What did you take so long changing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie looked quizzically at Jeff, &quot;Oh? Oh definitely not! You were so right in pointing out that I truly didn&#39;t want to be a mother right now. I wouldn&#39;t have realized it without you having pointed it out but you always do see through me, just like your dad did! Besides, I said we were taking turns so these changes were all about you. So I went with the ideas you pitched, I set it up on a 5 minute timer so we could discuss it as the changes happened, I thought that would be more exciting.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blood drained from Jeff&#39;s face, &quot;If you don&#39;t want to be a mother where does that leave me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie looked at Jeff&#39;s look of terror and laughed, &quot;Oh Jeff, don&#39;t worry so much, you&#39;re so up tight! This is going to be fun! I made sure of it.  You brought the idea up and it really seemed to fit with what I was going for so I just went with it. You&#39;re going to be my older brother, I was thinking of making you a younger brother, but thought that if you were older, your circle of friends might be cute and would be a perfect age...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be older than my mom and I don&#39;t want to set you up!&quot; Jeff began to plead but stopped short when he shuddered as the beginning changes rippled throughout his body, it felt intoxicatingly good and he let a tiny moan of pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m tired of taking care of a teenager! So it was this or you become my 50 year old uncle who lives 5 states away... I thought you&#39;d prefer this.&quot; Jamie said with a smirk. Jeff had already finished growing to his adult height and due to the reality change setting his clothes had shifted with him. Jeff&#39;s body was now bulking up with muscle, Jamie gave him the same treatment she gave herself to give Jeff movie star level good looks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you aren&#39;t prepared to jump into the life of a 27 year old as is, obviously.&quot; Jamie rolled her eyes, &quot;I&#39;ve already been 25 but you have a lot to learn... lots of &#39;experiences&#39; to have that will mellow out that outrageously annoying tendency you have to immediately judge everything and quite often be negative about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why exactly do you expect me to be happy about someone else deciding that my life and apparently my personality aren&#39;t good enough and forcing changes on me?&quot; Jeff asked getting anxious, another pulse washed over Jeff, he moaned louder and was a little disoriented for a second after.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jeff, life changes whether you are ready for it or not, and if you are doing your job to be a good human, your perspective changes and grows over time. All I did was make sure a few things happened to guide how your perspective grows, like any good parent would.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What &#39;few things&#39; are you talking about?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh lots of stuff, girlfriends and dating, finishing high school, going through a number of jobs with different companies, working through college, going to and even throwing parties, struggling to stay in your budget, buying this house with your sister, picking up new hobbies and pass-times... Lots and lots of stuff. I did specifically throw in that you would embrace the idea of work hard, play hard. I made sure you were just as handsome as I am beautiful and I made you a little bit of an adrenaline junkie.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I don&#39;t like this. I&#39;m going to stop it.&quot; Jeff stood up unsteadily, unprepared for his new weight distribution and height.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, if you step foot in your room while the changes are occurring, they will complete immediately and you will forget ever having been my son.&quot; Jamie said icily. &quot;Now I think its time you grew up a little and learned how to make the best of things...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff staggered as the mental changes accelerated. &quot;Woah.&quot; Jeff said as he sat back down in his chair. Jeff shuddered trying to collect himself for a minute as he began assessing his new thoughts and feelings. &quot;You&#39;re turning me into a jock?&quot; realizing he fondly remembered playing football throughout the last two years of high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite, more of an athlete which will tie into you&#39;re active hobbies and maintaining your physique.&quot; Jamie said...<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! You... I&#39;m huge and slutty...&quot; Jeff said as he recalled all the times he used his generous endowment.<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled, &quot;I think you mean, endowed and experienced.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! That&#39;s...&quot; Jeff didn&#39;t know. He knew how he would have felt seconds ago, but memories of parties and hookups and casual encounters of all sorts flooded his memories. &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Jeff recalled getting intoxicated with booze and drugs and doing all the types of things he never would have done... and he didn&#39;t hate himself. <br />
<br />
Jamie beamed in response to Jeff&#39;s reaction. &quot;Finally!&quot; she exclaimed with relief. &quot;Your puritan-esque sense of moral superiority was bland at best and needlessly infuriating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was trying to process years worth of data in seconds and suddenly it was over just as quickly as it began. Wait, that&#39;s not quite right. His mental history just caught up to his current physical age, as he continued to transform new memories and thoughts crept in, he just started a new job... several months ago, no a year ago and he&#39;s hoping for a promotion soon. Every second that passed was around 2 weeks of experiences. &quot;I&#39;m a model?&quot; Jeff asked with a quick grin finding it hard to focus.<br />
<br />
&quot;For a side hustle, yes, I made sure you were very handsome and realized you might as well capitalize on it.&quot; Jamie said with a smirk. &quot;Fitness, underwear, swimsuits, clothes, I think you even posed for an art class once or twice. If I get bored I may even turn you into a movie star, just to see what its like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up easily, his body had changed drastically but it felt normal now that the mental changes were in time with the physical ones. He went to the bathroom and turned on the light. He was muscular and lean, his face was much more angular and lost the youthful appearance of a high schooler. He looked around 20 and was able to see his physique grow if he watched closely. <br />
<br />
Jeff worked hard and played hard. extreme activities thrilled him as did wild parties and sex. Jeff the quiet introverted 16 year old was becoming quieter and quieter in the back of his mind, yeah he wouldn&#39;t have liked the situation but his new life is pretty amazing and he has the mentality to actually enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Jeff returned to the kitchen, now 22, &quot;So, how&#39;s this going to work sis?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled, &quot;We are going to have a blast but let the transformation finish, it will probably answer most of your questions. Just remember to only invite cute rich guys into your circle of friends so I can have my pick of them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff cringed not liking the idea of his little sister possibly getting hurt but he remembered his mom set this whole thing up, and besides, who doesn&#39;t like a good fuck every now and then? &quot;Eh, whatever.&quot;</p>
