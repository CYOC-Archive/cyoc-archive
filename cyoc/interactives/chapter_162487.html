<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boats were only for two people, so Annetta and Giana were alone on the ride. <br />
<br />
The boat was propelled along the flume, it moved slowly towards a lift hill that will take them on a winding course in the water-filled trough.<br />
<br />
“Giana this is wrong!” Annetta whined. “Something isn’t right here!” Giana rolled her eyes, the boat began pulling up the hill. <br />
<br />
“Maybe it is, but it’s too late now!” Giana laughed. They began to creast the top of the lift hill. “Here it comes!” And down they went. Giana and Annetta were lifted up by the force of the fall as they went almost straight out making a splashdown. Then up again as the water flume took them closer to another lift hill, this one bigger than the first one. <br />
<br />
Annetta bounced up and down with her friend. And her worry began to disolve. Soon she was laughing along with Giana. She was finally feeling like she made the right choice when they did an exciting drop and an enormous splashdown. This splashdown was too big that both girls took a mouthful of water. They wiped their eyes off and began to laugh harder. The boat now rumbled around the inside of the mountain.<br />
<br />
“Yeee-haw!” Annetta called out. <br />
<br />
Giana began to cry out, only to freeze. Her throat briefly looked like it was vibrating.“Heeee haw!” Giana brayed. Her hands leapt up to her mouth. Annetta turned to look at her wide-eyed friend.<br />
<br />
“What was that?” She tried to yell over the water moving noise. Giana just shook her head. The water ride began to pick up speed. They entered now a pure dark tunnel. In the dark neither Annetta nor Giana could see each other. The cold air whipping through the tunnel about froze them. And it made it harder for them to feel what was happening to them at that moment. <br />
<br />
Giana’s ears felt funny. Her entire body was cold from her drenched clothes and the wind, but her ears felt like they were burning up. Giana was now convinced they were on fire. If Annetta or Giana could have seen their ears, they would have seen them reshaping. The tops of their ears were being pulled up, pinched on top by invisible fingers.<br />
<br />
All of this went unnoticed by the two as they emerged from a tunnel, only into a wall of mist. “I don’t feel so good.” Giana yelled out.<br />
<br />
Annetta looked over at her friend, only seeing some of her outline through the mist. “You-something’s not right.”<br />
<br />
Giana opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out. Her hands grabbed at her stomach, which was bubbling and raging. Annetta kept talking but Giana didn’t respond. Her stomach began to burn now. <br />
<br />
Giana threw her head back.“Heee haw! Hee haw! Hee-haw! Hee haw!” Giana gasped and collapsed against the boat’s deck, as they came out of the fog. <br />
<br />
Annetta pointed a trembling finger at Giana.“Your ears!” Annetta cried. Giana looked up at her.“Hee haw!” Giana brayed again.<br />
<br />
Before Annetta could scream, the water flume jerked them around a tight curve. The boat began to shake back and forth as the two girls rolled towards their end. <br />
<br />
And then they felt something brand new, something neither of them had felt before. “Owwww!” Annetta groaned. Giana let out a soft bray. Behind them, two bulges began to press out against their panties. Tents pushed up from just above their butts, held in place only by their very tight waist bands.<br />
<br />
“What’s happening....” Annetta moaned now, her tongue lulling out the side of her mouth. Her new growth was driving her insane. It just kept pushing out. She could feel her underwear ripping, but her pink sleeveless dress kept it closed. Annetta could see something similar happening to Giana.<br />
<br />
“Hee-haw!” Giana brayed out, now as her pants began to expand further. Annetta’s tail felt like a trapped animal, wrestling against the back of her dress. She tried to scream out in terror, screaming for anyone who would listen.<br />
<br />
Giana could feel her tail trying to break through the back of her pants. Then, two brand new donkey tails streamed out behind the girls. Annetta pushed her head up to look back at her. It was rigid, hairy and longer. It was coated in brown hair, except for the thick brush of blond hair at the end, the same color of her hair. <br />
<br />
Annetta’s tail smacked into Giana’s sending a shiver up both girl’s spines. Annetta managed to grab her tail though the end kept being whipped back by the force of the wind.<br />
<br />
“Oh no! I have a fucking tail!” Annetta cried out. Giana brayed at her. “I grow-I grow a tail too!” <br />
<br />
The boat now began pulling up third lifthill again, slowing things down a bit. Annetta continued to examine her tail. Giana meanwhile just slumped against her chair. “We-we… HEEHAW! We are doomed!” <br />
<br />
Annetta shook her head, trying to get her voice back. “We’re turning into donkeys.” Giana was panicked and turned towards her.<br />
<br />
“No, no! Please, Annetta! Don’t let me be a donkey! I don’t want to be an ass! Heeeeeee haaaaawww!” Giana brayed, ears folding back. “Hee-haw hee-haw hee-haw!” Giana couldn’t speak anymore, Annetta growled at her.<br />
<br />
Giana continued to bray and now began to slap her tail against the boat’s bow. Annetta’s own tail began to curl up.<br />
<br />
The boat began to approach the top of the water flume. Giana now got in Annetta’s face, still braying. Annetta snorted.“Hee haw!” Annetta brayed back, screaming at her. “Hee haw! Hee haw! Hee haw!” The two now brayed like the animals they were, and brought on the latest change in both of them. The girl’s teeth began to expand, or rather most of their teeth. Their canines were slowly crushed into nothing by growing mollars. Their teeth were reshaped into big blocks, designed to grind and crush straw and grass. While their teeth grew, neither of their mouths had grown yet. Their teeth now stuck out outside of their mouths. It wasn’t certain either girl could fully close their mouths now. But that was far from their minds.<br />
<br />
And now the boat crested the lift hill. The two girls turned around just in time to see they were rolling at breakneck speed now. “No no no!” Annetta cried out, her human voice returning as the wind and water shoved her against the seat. Then there came another big splashdown. As the first one, a strong amount entered to Annetta and Giana’s mouths. Drinking the cursed water of Pleasure Island turned everyone into their real form, for example into donkeys symbolizing their bad behavior. <br />
<br />
The water shook back and forth the boat as the girls rolled into yet another tunnel. This tunnel, unlike the other one, had stripes of light coming through the ceiling. Annetta could see Giana’s face for brief snippets in the darkness. Now she could see their changed teeth and their big tails flapping in the wind. <br />
<br />
Annetta pointed at her, but Giana didn’t look up. Annetta began now to be banged against the deck of the boat. She tried pushing herself back but the force of the boat made that impossible. Her hands kept banging against the boat, sending waves of pain up her arms. And slowly making them go numb.<br />
<br />
The light seemed to come in shorter flashes but Annetta was finally able to catch something in one beam. Her fingers looking bruised up. Actually, her hands looked more than bruised but rather gray, like the color was being sucked out of them. And her nails were a shiny black in color. <br />
<br />
Though Annetta couldn’t see it, Giana’s hands were the same. Annetta’s wrists felt like they were growing narrower, while her palms were expanding outward. And her fingers now began to curl up, into a disk like shape. The deep gray of her nails now began to expand over the fingers. Annetta’s fingers melted into each other, with her thumbs expanding out to form the base of her new hooves. Her palms meanwhile expanded to meet the new hooves, growing into more of a cone like shape.<br />
<br />
Even through the cold air on her body, Annetta could feel a pricking coming through her skin. It went up to her wrist and the sensation matched one Annetta had felt across her tail. In the back of her mind Annetta knew this was fur. <br />
<br />
Finally the boat emerged into light again. And Annetta could see her arms crowned with two new hooves that banged against the deck. Giana had a matching set. <br />
<br />
“I have hoofs!” Annetta cried out. “I have… Hee Haw! Hee Haw! Hee Haw!” She screamed, trying to get the bray to stop. No such luck, another bray escaped Annetta’s throat.<br />
<br />
The two girls slammed into the boat wall. The shockwave rattled through the girl’s chests, setting off the next round of changes. Annetta and Giana’s shoulders began to expand in unison. Their chests expanded and their ribs began to barrel out. Human ribs and muscles would no longer due, a new shape was required for their future as pack animals. Annetta could feel her shoulders and back thickening up as the transformation weaved new muscle under the skin.<br />
<br />
While Giana’s pants and Annetta’s dress held together still, their top clothes were not so lucky. Their bras were ripped as these new muscles emerged. Annetta’s pink long-sleeve shirt and Giana’s green blouse were the next to break in several pieces. Then, their shredded clothing began to float away.<br />
<br />
“Come back!” Annetta cried, trying to grab the scraps of her shirt. Sadly there was no way to grab them with hooves. “Hee-haw!” <br />
<br />
The boat started coming down again. And all Annetta could do was cry out as it did. But strangely Giana had stopped crying. She no longer disliked the idea of being a donkey, in fact she was beginning to like it.<br />
<br />
Giana’s were closed and ears pinned against her skull, each bray she made causing her body to shudder. <br />
<br />
Annetta wanted to clock her but found she was having trouble adjusting her arms. In fact Annetta couldn’t move her shoulders as well as before. She could move her arms back and forth with relative ease. But side to side was proving...difficult to Annetta. What she couldn’t see where her shoulders readjusting for a quadruped stance. A donkey has no need to stand on two legs. And the legs were what now began to feel funny for Annetta. <br />
<br />
She couldn’t see them, her Mary Jane shoes were still on for now, but her toes were beginning to morph. From the base of each a dark gray substance sprung from beneath the skin. It emerged like oil, rapidly encasing her extremities in a hard shell.The new hooves didn’t just encase her toes, they replaced them.<br />
<br />
Annetta could feel her feet growing more and more numb as the hooves consumed them. And then she noticed her legs were growing causing her body to move further away from her shoes.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!?” Annetta screamed. Before she could react further a shoe hit her upside the head. Giana laughed and kicked her now hoof topped legs, sending her other shoe flying out of the boat. Giana was now enjoying her transformation.<br />
<br />
Before Annetta could say anything to Giana, her attention was pulled back to her stretching ankles. Her pink dress meanwhile began to rip as her thighs and ass exploded with muscle. Annetta brayed in irritation, as her dress finally ripped to shreads. <br />
<br />
Now all that remained on Annetta were dress scraps and her shoes. She kept pinned to the foot of the boat by force. As the boat entered to a water flume shaped as corkscrew turn though all these things were thrown away. The force of the turn threw Annetta into Giana, and Annetta’s shoes off of her feet. The remaining clothes was finally tossed off by Annetta’s tail.<br />
<br />
Now Annetta was completely naked. A part of her was glad to no longer have those irritating, confining garments on her. “And I shouldn’t have them on me” Annetta thought, “because they’d just get in my way. They’d making grazing harder...wait no...”<br />
<br />
Annetta attempted to rub her eyes but succeeded only in hitting herself in the forehead with her hoof. “Damn it!” She screamed. Then she started to cry. “I don’t want to be a donkey!”<br />
<br />
Giana just shook her head. Giana had lost her speech early on. And now her thoughts were starting to dim. But she had enough thought to see what foolishness this was. Giana was ready to not think anymore, just spend her days braying and grazing. It was time for Annetta to join her. <br />
<br />
The boat entered the mountain again, the final stretch now. The chairs began to fold backwards into the boat itself. This had the end result of dumping Annetta and Giana face first into the front of the boat. They both stood, now on all fours. Giana brayed and grinned. Annetta just continued to cry. Her big teeth and ears, her long tail and hard hooves, none of this made her seem human. She was no longer human. She was a donkey.<br />
<br />
The boat was going slower now and approaching a wall of water. Annetta tried to take a step back, but that didn’t work. There was no real room to maneuver in this boat. Annetta kicked at the back wall with her hoof, trying to slow it down more. Maybe even stop it. No such luck. <br />
<br />
They crashed into the river of water full force. Annetta screamed, which only meant her mouth was open. Now came one big mouth full of water. “Bleh!” The water washed over both their bodies, and in turn it washed the humanity off of them. <br />
<br />
First went the hair on their heads, or most of it. On the left and right sides it was washed away like dry grass in a flood. All that remained was a long stripe of hair. And then new hairs that began to sprout down their necks. The hair that remained grown much thicker and longer. It stood erect for the most part, much more bristley than what the girls had known before. Annette’s hair was still blond, and the Giana’s one was still red too. And it seemed to collect all the remaining water, which then slowly flowed out from it. Now where the water went, brand new fur sprouted. It was brown in most places, very fine and thick to coat. <br />
<br />
“I am not going to be a donkey.”Annetta closed her eyes and grit her teeth. She began to feel a pressure in her face. Giana was breathing much harder now. And then she began braying again.“Hee haw!” As Giana brayed her face began to puff up. Her nose and lips began being pulled forward, her nose collapsing into her upper lip. Giana’s nostrils expanded as her nose collapsed, allowing her to take much deeper breaths. “Haw! Haw! Hee haw! Hee haw!” Every bray made Giana’s face push out a little more. This didn’t stop her from braying though. <br />
<br />
“I am not going to bray”. Annetta grit her teeth harder as she felt her face expanding. She didn’t need to see it, the feeling of water and air running across her larger head told her everything. <br />
<br />
“Oh no!” A mass of light gray with deep brown at the base greeted her. “No no no!” Annetta opened her mouth and stuck her huge tongue out. She ran it across her hairy nose, feeling and tasting her brand new nostrils. “No no no!” Annetta screamed.</p>
