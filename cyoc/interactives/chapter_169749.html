<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After yesterday I was so confused about what to do about school. I mean I didn&#39;t want to be bombarded with... offers. But then again I kind of did. My inner short-dick definitely wanted every one he could get, but I still had classes, sports, friendships. I wasn&#39;t just a short-dick in need of a large-dick donation! Mostly.<br />
<br />
My alarm went off at 6 as usual for a Monday and I slowly sat up and stretched. I clambored out of bed and headed to my drawers to put on some clothes. Looking out the window I saw Mr Jenkins returning from his round the block walk. Mmm... I think it&#39;s time for breakfast!<br />
<br />
He looked up at my window and waved, reaching down I could see him shake the huge long shape hidden in his trousers from here. Bounding down I headed into the crisp morning and leaping the fence stood before him, not even a little out of breath. &quot;Good morning sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning my little one, ready?&quot; He was unbuckling immediately and I was already starting to kneel. I dove on his cock as soon as the head squng heavily free. Fuck I loved this cock so much. Not just cause it was the biggest, well the biggest so far, but it was perfect! I knew all it&#39;s features now, the way the head bulged out from the shaft, the foreskin bunched up at the base of the head, loose enough to pull back and forth easily, but not too loose. The way the slit had these little, almost lips that were a little puffy, sticking forward from the head, the shade of red, with the tiniest hint of purple. Then the shaft, the silky feel of the skin, taut and still looking, no doubt, as good as the day he transitioned. The thick vein on top that snaked from a couple of inches under the head swerving to the right for an inch or two then falling back in dead centre all the way to the base. The way the shaft was straight with the tiniest upward curve, the smoothness of that curve.<br />
<br />
And his balls! Fuck they were so heavy, oval and smooth to the touch, they hung so low, the skin thinner there and you could tell they were sensitive. I swear if you held one up and was quiet you could hear those baby makers churning up. No wonder he still had his lower abdominals protruding, a common sign of large-dick heft, like the body is weight training those muscles every day in order to support such a mammoth structure.<br />
<br />
Yes, definitely this was my favourite cock. I worked it effortlessly now, knowing all the spots that make him spurt that sweet pre into my mouth to trickle down my throat. And one spurt of pre, easily a good shot glass worth, and it had a nutty, honey like taste to me. I could feel him tense and widen, pulling back so his cock head was in my mouth I began to tongue his piss hole. I could hear him moan above me. I know how much he loved this.<br />
<br />
And after a good 30 seconds I snaked him back down my throat to deposit a massive load in me. Gasping and giddy I pulled off him, kissing his sweet massive cock, from shaft to head in little kisses. Then I licked the head clean of any drips or cum and tucked him back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young one...&quot; he gasped... &quot;such a lovely young one.&quot; He stroked my cheek. &quot;Same time tomorrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait.&quot; I really couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
An hour later I was dressed for school, Chris and I were in my little car and we were on our way to his school.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you went with the falsie then?&quot; Chris noted nodding at my crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, I guessed it was best, at least for now.&quot; I had struggled with the idea but it was necessary to protect myself. Ian wouldn&#39;t reveal my secret, and based on what he said about George, he would protect me too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably best....&quot; Chris trailed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;You OK there?&quot; I asked concerned, trying my best to ignore the enormous bulge in his slacks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea... I was just wondering...&quot; Chris looked a little shy, something you would never think of for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re worrying me Chris...&quot; he shot me a pouty look &quot;I mean sir. What&#39;s wrong?&quot; I was genuinely worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now you&#39;ve come into, well now... I mean do you need? Fuck it, I want... no I&#39;m gonna be your feeder!&quot; He shouted jumping up in his seat as he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yea, &quot; I chuckled, &quot;I mean I just assumed you were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did?!&quot; Chris said open mouthed.<br />
<br />
I did, he was my first, both ways. And his cock was magnificent! And I trusted and loved him. &quot;Sorry I should have said. Yes sir, you are one of my feeders. I was thinking evening meals and midnight snacks duty? If that works for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He had to push it. &quot;Hmm I guess that could work. And why did you assume I would? What about me makes me the best feeder for you boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
I had to stroke his ego, I wanted to stroke something else. And suck it. And ride it actually.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because my little brother has the biggest penis.&quot; I lied, a little white lie, well little is the wrong word, you know what I mean! &quot;Because no matter where I am, if you&#39;re there, you will always be the biggest and have the best cum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn straight!&quot; He agreed, patting his partially engorged bulge before folding his arms. &quot;Shame we&#39;re here already, I wanted to give you a ride before you went to your school.&quot; My heart fluttered. I wanted that too now and I was staring right at his cockhead, bulging through the thin fabric of his slacks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d like that wouldn&#39;t you short-dick? Maybe I should pull you out the car and fuck you front of my whole school, let them all see what a large-dick I am and how lucky my short-dick brother is to have me?&quot; My nub was throbbing rhythmically now, I was so close to blowing.<br />
<br />
I heard him unclasp his buttons and shuffle back in his seat. &quot;Oh but I&#39;m not going to. No no no. Instead your gonna sit there and look.&quot; He lowered his trouser flap down a little, the thick base on display, sunlight through the windshield warming it in a yellow light. I moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it big bro, look at the base, it&#39;s thick isn&#39;t it, shall I show you more? Lower it further?&quot; I nodded mutely. &quot;Really, but what if anyone sees? What if someone sees this, they would know you&#39;re a small-dick then wouldn&#39;t they?&quot; I flushed, gulping, my heart racing, mouth watering. He did lower it, showing at least 8 inches of shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t care right? I mean if you got to suck this cock? Huh? Little-dick? Would you?&quot; I was shaking my head, I could only hear his voice and see his cock, nothing else mattered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; and then he pulled the fabric back up. &quot;I&#39;m a good brother and know that you don&#39;t actually want that.&quot; I whined, loudly, watching him reclasp his trousers. His cock was still hard. If he stepped out now, they&#39;d see it. They&#39;d get to see the large-dick man my brother is.<br />
<br />
He leaned over and whispered in my ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to remember little-dick, I can have you on your knees, on your back, anytime I want. Next time you assume something, make sure you tell me first. Now, off you go to school.&quot; He unclicked his door and jumped out. Turning back he smiled at me, I looked dazed and confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;One last thing.&quot; I made eye contact with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck your dick is tiny.&quot; I shivvered as I came in my trousers right then and there. Thank go my falsie was there to siphon it away.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you at home.&quot; He said closing the door and walking away.<br />
<br />
I sat in the car park for a good 5 minutes, trying to sort my thoughts out and get myself ready for my first day back since the longest, bestest weeekend ever.</p>
