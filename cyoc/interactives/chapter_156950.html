<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>You know those times when you’re just so inspired that you want to write another chapter the same day you write the first one? Yeah, that’s what happened here. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex woke up the next morning to find that he was drenched in sweat. The young man sat up in bed and pulled the comforter off his body, revealing that the entirety of both his tank top and his boxers were completely soaked with his sweat. Disgusted, Alex got out of his bed. He glanced over at Sam’s bed to see that the blonde haired boy was still fast asleep, which made Alex a little envious. Ignoring his feelings of jealousy towards his sleeping friend, Alex quietly walked over to his dresser and pulled out a fresh pair of boxers and a new tank top before walking into the bathroom to take a shower. <br />
<br />
When Alex finished his shower, he dried himself off with the towel and walked over to the sink so he could brush his teeth. As he grabbed his toothbrush, he noticed that the back of his right hand had an abundance of brown hair on it. At first, the 18 year old was confused as to why there was so much hair on his hand. Then he remembered the events of yesterday. <br />
<br />
“Shit...it’s already starting…” Alex muttered to himself. The young male proceeded to move away from the sink towards the large full body mirror that hung in the bathroom. Maybe there were other changes?<br />
<br />
As Alex stood in front of the mirror, the first thing that he noticed was how his body was much different than it was the previous morning. For starters, his muscles were a bit larger than before. His biceps were slightly larger and his abs were much more visible than before. His shoulders were a bit broader, and he also felt like he was a few inches taller. <br />
<br />
The next thing that Alex noticed was the abundance of hair on his body. His chest, arms, and legs were practically covered in brown hairs. Out of morbid curiosity, Alex found himself feeling the hair, surprised at how different it felt. It didn’t feel like hair at all! In fact, it felt more like...fur…<br />
<br />
As he continued to examine his body, Alex noticed a number of other smaller changes. His fingernails and toenails had grown longer and started to darken in color. His teeth seemed to be getting sharper, and his ears had elongated and now had a bit of a point to them. <br />
<br />
Eventually, his gaze drifted downwards towards his nether region, examining the area for changes. To Alex’s surprise though, his sexual equipment looked significantly different. His dick had changed into that of a canine’s, complete with a red tint to the organ and a large, bulbous knot. Not only that, but his dick was larger and thicker too, standing at a good 7 inches while flaccid. His balls were also slightly larger, and like the rest of his body, they were becoming covered in brown fur. As Alex examined his equipment, a slight smile formed on his face. <br />
<br />
“Not bad…” he said to himself. “Not bad at all…”<br />
<br />
Alex stopped admiring himself in the mirror and began to put on his new clothes. As he put on the boxers, he noticed how tight that they now felt thanks to his larger cock, which was making a large, well defined bulge in his boxers. Once he put on his tank top, Alex took one last look at himself in the mirror before walking out of the bathroom. <br />
<br />
As he walked out of the bathroom and back into the bedroom that he shared with Sam, Alex noticed that Sam was now awake and sitting at the foot of his bed. The young blonde haired male had taken off his shirt, and he was currently examining his arms, presumably looking at fur. <br />
<br />
“Any changes on your end?” Alex asked, getting Sam’s attention. <br />
<br />
“Huh?” Sam asked. “Oh! Yeah, I...uh...I’ve got a few changes.”<br />
<br />
Alex sat down on the bed next to Sam. “Like what?” <br />
<br />
“My arms, legs, and chest have a bunch of blonde colored fur on them,” Sam said. “I can feel that my teeth have grown longer and sharper, and there’s this large bump on my tailbone that I can only assume is the beginnings of my tails. How about you?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I’ve got fur growing all over my body,” Alex said. “My teeth and ears have changed too, and my body has bulked up a bit.”<br />
<br />
Sam chuckled. “Coach is going to flip out when he finds out that his star player has been turned into a werewolf.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but will that be a good thing or a bad thing?” Alex wondered. <br />
<br />
“It’ll be a good thing,” Sam assured him. “I know it will be.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…yeah! You’re right!” Alex said, wrapping his arm around Sam and laughing. “The team is going to be better than ever once we finish transforming!” <br />
<br />
As Alex wrapped his arm around Sam, Sam found himself blushing furiously. He had always liked Alex...but as nothing more than a friend. Yet for some reason, feeling Alex’s arm wrap around his shoulder and pull him closer to the large muscular male made Sam’s heart race. What was going on?! <br />
<br />
Sam’s gaze unknowingly began to drift down towards the large bulge in Alex’s boxers. As much as he wanted to look away and avoid being caught, the young male was practically mesmerized. <br />
<br />
“Wh-what about...d-d-down...th-there…?” Sam stuttered, unable to control his speech. <br />
<br />
Alex finally noticed where Sam had been looking for the past few minutes and let out a chuckle. “Oh, you noticed,” he said. “Yeah, my dick is bigger than it was before. It’s completely canine now too.”<br />
<br />
Sam finally averted his gaze away from Alex’s massive bulge, only to lock eyes with Alex. His friend had the most beautiful green eyes...and such a gorgeous face too...he just wanted to…<br />
<br />
Before Sam could react, Alex quickly leaned in and began kissing Sam. Sam’s eyes widened in shock. What the hell was Alex doing?! Why was he kissing him...and why did he like it? Despite the voices in Sam’s head screaming for him to push Alex away, he wrapped his arms around Alex, closed his eyes, and let Alex take control. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Alex broke the kiss and Sam opened his eyes. The two stared at each other in silence before Alex asked “What just happened?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure…” Sam responded. “One minute you and I were just talking, and the next we were kissing...and I liked it! Oh my God, I liked it! But this doesn’t make any sense! I’m straight! I’ve never been attracted to men!”<br />
<br />
“The doctor did say that sexuality changes were common,” Alex said. “Maybe...we’re gay…”<br />
<br />
Sam just stared at Alex in disbelief. “But I’m not gay,” he said. “I’m just not!”<br />
<br />
“Neither am I!” Alex exclaimed, putting his head in his hands. “And yet I was just kissing you passionately after you were staring at my dick! I should feel disgusted, but…” <br />
<br />
Alex trailed off, not finishing his sentence. <br />
<br />
“‘But…’ what?” Sam asked. <br />
<br />
Alex lifted his head, turning to look at Sam. <br />
<br />
“But I want to do it again…”<br />
<br />
Sam quietly thought to himself for a minute or two before sighing “Fuck, so do I.”<br />
<br />
Alex didn’t waste a second, wrapping his arms around Sam and pulling his friend into a passionate kiss. Sam gave in almost instantly, letting Alex take control once again.</p>
