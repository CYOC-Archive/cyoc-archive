<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{SERIES NOTE: These are a different group of Jenkins than the ones featured in our companion <i>Moon Lake, Andersons</i> stories.}}<br />
<br />
While Melissa Jenkins has been contemplating at least her immediate future over our previous two episodes...<br />
<br />
Harold Jenkins slowly awoke to a new day.<br />
Everything was still relatively new to him, having only recently become a weretiger.<br />
The first thing he noticed was the heady scents in the air.<br />
One was the distinct smell of cedar. This was a familiar odor, considering most of the furniture in what would be his den if the new house he just bought in Moon Lake had enough room for one.<br />
The rest were a mixture of aromas that made both his heart and new tigerhood stir. An unique combination of passionate sex and his mate.<br />
<i>Mate. Now there&#39;s a wonderful word,</i> he thought happily.<br />
Then he became aware of the soft form cuddled next to him. The seductive curves of her furry body. The gentle rise and fall of her chest as she slept soundly next to him, with her head nuzzled under his chin as she rested within the crook of his arm.<br />
Harold Jenkins stared at the sleeping form of his new fiance Virginia McCoy and couldn&#39;t help smiling.<br />
His longing for his deceased wife was over. Replaced by something different, but no less important than the love he felt for the woman who shared many years of her life with him, giving the happy couple a beautiful daughter named Melissa and a plethora of wonderful memories before the dark cloud of the initial cancer diagnosis foreshadowed the end of that stage of his life.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, even with the move to Moon Lake in hopes of finding a fresh start for both him and his daughter, finding love again was the farthest thing from his mind.<br />
But life had other ideas for Harold Jenkins.<br />
He knew there was interest, at least on her part, the moment Virginia first knocked on his door.<br />
In hindsight, he did feel an attraction to her, even before finding out she was a weretigress, because the Jenkins family wasn&#39;t too happy finding out about the Mandatory Were Law, and the ensuing pressure for one of them to become the family were.<br />
Yet fate intervened when Harold got too close to the &quot;cat fight&quot; between Virginia and Alice DeCrux and wound up being scratched by McCoy; although the Moon Lake Police Department still has some lingering doubt as to whether this was a true accident or part of some sneaky plan on Alice&#39;s part.<br />
Either way, now Harold Jenkins was a weretiger.<br />
At first, the only positive thing about this appeared to be the pressure being off his daughter. <i>Yet if Mel is falling in love with that boy Trevor, she&#39;ll become a were in time too.</i><br />
But Harold soon discovered something more important.<br />
Whether or not she was a were, he WAS falling in love with Virginia McCoy.<br />
Now the two were engaged and planning to spend the rest of their were-extended lives together.*<br />
<br />
Harold Jenkins looked down at the wonderful woman in his arms and gently gave her a loving kiss on top of her furry head.<br />
An action that stirred Virginia awake.<br />
&quot;Good morning, my wonderful Harold,&quot; she said with a smile on her muzzle, before kissing him.<br />
&quot;Good morning to you too,&quot; he said, after their lips reluctantly parted.<br />
&quot;How long have you been awake?&quot; she wondered, while slowly running a taloned finger across his chest fur.<br />
&quot;Not sure, but it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m right where I want to be, with who I want to be with,&quot; happily replied Harold, before kissing her again.<br />
&quot;You know what? So am I!&quot; happily declared Virginia, before swinging herself around to be on top of her man. &quot;Any plans for today?&quot; she asked, seductively pressing herself against him.<br />
&quot;Whatever you want,&quot; replied Harold, while wrapping his arms around her, although Virginia had no intention of leaving. &quot;Although at some point I should at least check on Mel.&quot;<br />
&quot;Something we&#39;ll both do a little later. After all, she&#39;s going to be my stepdaughter,&quot; pointed out Virginia, while rubbing her nose against his, the way Eskimos are supposed to kiss. &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about things though.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? Like what?&quot; wondered Harold, while running his paws along the luscious curves of her shapely form.<br />
<br />
&quot;First off, I know I originally suggested waiting till next summer to get married so we can have time for a honeymoon, but I don&#39;t want to wait that long. How about we tie the knot over the Christmas/Winter break this December?&quot; she asked, while moving her body in such a way that her breasts were rubbing against his chest as her moist tigress cunt was edging ever closer to his growing spear of tigerhood.<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me dear,&quot; replied Harold, while reaching underneath Virginia to cup her ample breasts.<br />
&quot;If she&#39;s agreeable, I would like Mel to be my Maid of Honor,&quot; announced Virginia, before she started moaning as Harold began teasing her hard nipples.<br />
&quot;All you have to do is ask, but I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be flattered,&quot; said Harold, as he felt an erotic moistness start to caress the head of his stiff penis.<br />
&quot;When we can think much more clearly, we&#39;re going to have to do some serious planning. After all, what are we going to do with two houses?&quot; wondered Virginia. &quot;I own mine free and clear while you&#39;ve just started buying yours, but neither is totally big enough for our extended family, even without John Sebastian Jenkins.**&quot;<br />
&quot;Sell both and buy a new one, together?&quot; suggested Harold, as he felt the tip of his cock start to enter something warm, moist, and tight. &quot;But you&#39;re not going to get pregnant now, are you?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; said Virginia, stopping everything to look at him. &quot;Oh. No. Don&#39;t worry dearest. Not until we&#39;re officially married and everything&#39;s settled. I took today&#39;s weretigress birth control pill when I got up earlier to answer Nature&#39;s call while you were still asleep,&quot; she revealed, before leaning forward to kiss Harold again.<br />
&quot;Now then, where were we?&quot; asked the future Mrs. Jenkins, before she resumed her seductive conquest of Harold&#39;s cock.<br />
&quot;Right there,&quot; said Harold with a smile, as he felt Virginia take more of him inside her.<br />
&quot;Oh, that feels so good!&quot; she declared, feeling his tiger barbs start to stroke her love canal.<br />
&quot;I- I- t-totally a-gree,&quot; said Harold, unable to hold back a shudder of joy and erotic happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is one thing I would like to ask you dear,&quot; said Virginia, stopping everything to stare at him.<br />
&quot;Now?&quot; asked a confused Harold, feeling his cock twitch deeply within her.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I would never take advantage of the man I love,&quot; promised Virginia. &quot;I&#39;m not like that were-raccoon bitch,&quot; she added, referring to Alice Decrux.<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Harold wanted to know, even as he tried to raise his hips to further enter his fiance.<br />
&quot;I noticed all that lovely red hair you used to have grew back when you became a weretiger,&quot; said Virginia, staring at him, &quot;but have you ever thought about growing a beard?&quot;<br />
&quot;A beard?&quot; asked Harold in return. <i>Eliza always wanted me clean shaven, saying whiskers were too rough on her skin,</i> he remembered.<br />
&quot;Yes, a beard,&quot; said Virginia, leaning forward to stare at him eye to eye. &quot;Trimmed, of course. But that way, I have some sexy fur to love and caress, no matter what form we&#39;re in,&quot; she added with a smile, while running her paws seductively across his muzzle.<br />
&quot;The only promise I can make you is to try, my dear.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; she said, before taking him completely within her and initiating a new erotic dance between them.<br />
