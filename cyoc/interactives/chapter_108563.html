<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephen kept stroking his massive dick till it exploded a quart of cum onto the counter. He whipped of his dick and decided to go outside. He didn&#39;t put on a shirt thinking that every one should see Andre&#39;s( The name Stephen didn&#39;t seem right for his body) ripped body. He grabbed his phone and wallet and locked his apartment. He exited the building to find that he lived very close to the beach. He started to walk down to the boardwalk when a police cruiser rode by him. The cops gave him a condescending glare and seemed puzzled too. <br />
&quot; Those ops think everyone is running dope I swear&quot; he thought to himself as the cruiser left him and went down the street. <br />
He started to walk down the boardwalk. It was a nice day about 80 degrees but a nice breeze kept most people from sweating. Even though Andre had taken his shirt of it still was a crime to cover up this body. Andre went over to one of the vendors and bought a speedo. He went to the public bathroom and changed. Now nearly naked with his &quot; sword&quot; almost falling out of his speedo he walked down the beach. Andre could feel the girls looking at him. There eyes glazed over with lust. There mouths slightly drooling, there pussies wetting themselves just in case. Andre took a dip into the ocean. Walking into the surf was easy with this new body. Andre floated for a little bit before there was a tugging in his speedo. Andre ignored it at first but after three minutes it got his attention. He sat up and found that there was a white beach bimbo sucking at his dick. Andre was a bit startled but said something before his mind could catch up with his mouth.<br />
&quot; bitch if your gonna keep on sucking actually put some effort into it &quot; he said<br />
The girl nodded and after Andre had closed his eyes again floating his came deep into the girls mouth. In return Andre started to finger the girl in all the right places. Her pussy seemed to get a lot smaller as he finished but Andre didn&#39;t pay any attention to it as she orgasmed. They then walked back to shore. She held his hand through the big waves. Her hand seemed to get bigger to but that was prohebly the sun affecting his brain right? Andre needed to get some water. By the time they reached the sand a few girls were crying small puddles. Many more shouting and yelling &quot; damit&quot; &quot; but he was perfect &quot; and &quot; why are all the hot ones like that&quot; at first Andre didn&#39;t know what they were talking about till he looked over to his left at the former beach bimbo.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In her place stood a muscular black man. The salty water made his body glisten in the sun. Then he understood the girls thought that he was gay. And the worst part was he was holding Andre&#39;s hand still!!!!<br />
&quot;Get the fuk off me you fag!!!!!&quot; Andre yelled at him. &quot; I&#39;m not a gay cocksucker like you. I don&#39;t want your dam AIDS&quot; he shouted again.<br />
<br />
 The former girl must&#39;ve steel not been completely gone because the man started to tear up and walked away.Andre felt a little bad but went back on the board walk. He didn&#39;t have a towel so instead of buying one he stole one from someone&#39;s chair. He dried himself off he kept on walking. He passed by an ally way and saw the black man from the beach fucking one twink in the ass and fisting another. Andre moved on thinking about what could&#39;ve happned. Was there something in the water was it a weird fish. Was he always a man and Andre hallucinated the beach bimbo part. He was still contemplating the situation about how a white straight girl could turn into a gay massive black man. He didn&#39;t even notice two police officers swoop in right beside him. <br />
&quot; Sir you are under arrest for the robbery of the Arthur Street, Seven Eleven Last week.&quot; <br />
&quot; You bitches have got it wrong I never did that shit&quot; Andre protested as the cops put the handcuffs on him.<br />
&quot; the judge can be the judge of that&quot; the male cop said <br />
&quot;Not today&quot; Andre said as he kicked both cops and started to run Away. But froze in Place after sprinting twenty feet and then fell down. A third cop had stunned him with a tazer. He fell asleep and when he wokeup he was in a jail cell. <br />
Over the course of the next few days Andre pleaded for his phone call but then he couldn&#39;t remember anyone to call. More criminal history and dirt was found as the police looked threw his phone. Then his atourney came to see him. The lawyer told him that when they looked threw his phone that connected him to three more robberies, sevencar thefts, procession of cocaine, procession with the indent to distribute, resisting arrest three times, seven reported accounts of assault, failure to show for jury duty, and tax evasion. The atourney told him its best to plead guilty in the following court cases. But he could give the police information about drug and gang acrivity for a reduced sentence and better prison conditions Andre refused becuase he didn&#39;t want to rat out his brothers for his own personal gain. At the trials Andre pleaded guilty as suggested and the judge sentenced him to  eleven years in federal medium security prison. Which he will be sent to in one days time. Andre thought about where the chrovonic was maybe that could help him all he had to do was find it.</p>
