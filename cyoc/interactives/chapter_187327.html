<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty just remained at the beach, swimming and sunbathing as it was a beautiful day. A few people were there, and Ty was just soaking up the sun. He had merged a few people together using his awesome powers, and he felt very satisfied with that. <br />
<br />
About an hour or so after he had performed his last trick, a large male figure walked up to Ty’s lounge chair. It was Brandon, the result of Ty’s last merge. Brandon sat down in the sand, stretching out his long, muscular legs and arms. <br />
<br />
“Hey, big guy, how are you feeling?” Ty asked the large teen. <br />
<br />
“Gosh, I gotta get used to being so big! But it feels amazing!” <br />
<br />
“I bet it feels awesome having four other people fused into your body, including yourself, huh?” Ty asked him. <br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah! I can almost feel their thoughts and feelings. I have their personalities, too. It’s like they are all inside of me! I just wish…” Brandon sighed. <br />
<br />
“What?” <br />
<br />
“I’m just curious to know if there is any way you can make me any bigger than this?” the big boy asked Ty.<br />
<br />
Ty raised up his head and removed his sunglasses. <br />
<br />
“For real? Dude! Do you know how BIG you are now?” <br />
<br />
“Uhh, yeah… I just wanna feel what it’s like to grow even more, now that I got you here at the beach, knowing that you have the power to grow me more…” Brandon said shyly.<br />
<br />
“Ohh… You wanna be REALLY big, huh?” <br />
<br />
“You’re not angry at me for asking, are you?” <br />
<br />
“It’s your body, dude! If you don’t mind walking around like a giant, then it’s fine by me!” Ty smiled, as he stood up from the lounge chair. <br />
<br />
“Heck yeah! Make me into a giant!” Brandon grinned widely, standing up to his over 7-foot height, all muscle. <br />
<br />
“I can find more people to fuse you with or fuse you with someone else who is already BIG…” Ty pondered. <br />
<br />
“Ohh yeah! Do you know other people like me, who are merged together?” Brandon asked him.<br />
<br />
“Yes! I got Madison, who is a resulting fusion between Mason and Allison! We can start with him!” Ty smiled as he snapped his fingers. Suddenly, another teen appeared out of nowhere. He wasn’t as big as Brandon, but still, he was bigger than the average teen. <br />
<br />
“Whoa! How did I get here?” Madison wondered. <br />
<br />
“Hey Madison, do you mind if I fuse you with Brandon over here? You will make him even bigger than he is now!” Ty explained. <br />
<br />
“Oh, sure, why not? The more the merrier, right?” Madison smiled. <br />
<br />
Brandon just laid down on the sand, flat on his back. Then Madison just went to lie down on top of him when Ty concentrated on his powers. Very slowly, Madison’s body became absorbed by Brandon’s larger frame as Madison quickly sank into Brandon, making Brandon slowly grow bigger, wider and taller. Madison wasn’t a big guy so Brandon didn’t grow so much, but his big jawline grew a nice stubble as a result of the merge. <br />
<br />
“Ohh, whew!” Brandon groaned as he slowly got up. “I feel a bit bloated!” <br />
<br />
“Well, you just absorbed two more people named Mason and Allison, big guy!” Ty grinned. <br />
<br />
“Wow! What an incredible feeling! It feels so cool to merge like that! I can’t get enough of that!” Brandon grinned, looking at Ty. <br />
<br />
“Uhh… Wanna do it again?” Ty shrugged. <br />
<br />
“Heck yeah! One more time! Please!” Brandon smiled. <br />
<br />
“I know of one more person who is a result of a big fusion between seven people! He’s big, muscular, tall and very hairy! So, how about I merge you with Eddie over here?” Ty suggested as he snapped his fingers, allowing a huge, hulking man with a beard to appear.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Ty! Ohh, wow! What am I doing here on the beach?” Eddie said, as he checked out the surroundings. <br />
<br />
Eddie was even bigger than Brandon since he was the result of Ty merging himself with Kelly, Amy, Vanessa, Richie, Fiona, and Sandra. He had a big, bushy beard and he had hair all over his body. But he also had the sweetest personally since he was the merge of five young ladies. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Eddie! How would you like to be merged with Brandon over here? That way, you guys will form one huge giant of a man who will end up roaming around the beach for a long time! You’ll end up as the biggest guy around!” Ty grinned. “It will be my biggest fusion ever!” <br />
<br />
<br />
“Sure, I’d love to become pat of the biggest man on the beach! Let’s do this!” Eddie smiled. <br />
<br />
Ty instructed Brandon to lie down on his back in the sand one last time as Eddie lay on top of him. Ty focused his powers on the two large men as Eddie’s big body began to absorb into Brandon. The two large men began to form together into one large fleshy blob for a few seconds with the end result being a very large, tall and muscular male human being lying in the sand. The resulting figure had lots of facial hair, but he also had a coating of hair on his arms, chest and legs. The man was very big and muscular!<br />
<br />
When Brandon opened his eyes and got on his feet, he was standing around 10 feet tall! He was huge! <br />
<br />
“Oh, whoa! This is big! Really, REALLY big!” Brandon bellowed as Ty quickly adjusted his clothing, so the giant was still wearing his swim trunks and tank top, adjusted for his astounding size. <br />
<br />
“Well, you are now the result of me merging you with Mason, Allison, Kelly, Amy, Vanessa, Eddie, Richie, Fiona, Sandra, Tina, Jenny, Brandy and Lisa! Fourteen people merged into one being! Whew!” Ty grinned as he walked up to the teen giant, who was almost twice as tall as him. Ty barely reached up to the giant’s waist. <br />
<br />
“Thank you so much, Ty! I’m so happy now! This is incredible!” Brandon cheered, as he easily lifted Ty up with his giant hands. He hugged Ty briefly before setting the smaller teen down. Everybody just seemed so much smaller for the huge hairy giant, who towered over everything and everybody now. <br />
<br />
“Tell you what I’ll do, big guy! I’ll give you a small portion of my powers so you can change people only in ways that will help them, so you can increase their age, their size or their muscles! Got it?” Ty explained, snapping his fingers and bestowing a small set of powers upon the towering giant. “You can only change people in ways that will benefit them, not hurt them!” <br />
<br />
Brandon was more than happy with that and from that moment going forward he became known as the giant guardian of the beach. Ty still visited the beach often, so he was always around to help his big buddy out. In the meantime, Ty was always on the lookout for more people to fuse, since all his fused people were gone. They had all been merged together into one giant of a guy named Brandon!</p>
