<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having chose his dad and going over all of the options, Jacob decided to make a few small changes to see what exactly would happen to him and his dad based on the next choices he&#39;d make. For as long as Jacob could remember, he had been a huge fan of werewolves and transformation, plus ever since he hit puberty, which was two years ago at the age of twelve... he couldn&#39;t help thinking about how sexy his father was and was curious what it would be like to be with him sexually. He saw his father naked before, which made his own cock stir and was what made Jacob realize he was gay. However, with all of the stray thoughts and the innocent, but playful gropes of his own meat, Jacob never made a move to try anything. The thoughts were pervasive and always at the forefront of his mind when he was home and Jacob really wanted to act on his thoughts, desires, and fantasies, but at the same time that&#39;s what Jacob ended up leaving them as. He didn&#39;t think he&#39;d be able to go through with it... after all... this was his own father, but Jacob also felt nothing could hurt just fantasizing, which was exactly what he kept doing. That was... up until now. Now with this reality altering game, Jacob just figured that he could make the changes to his father and let things play out from there.<br />
<br />
The first thing that Jacob did was delete the parameter: &quot;human&quot; and changed it by typing in &quot;werewolf&quot;. The next thing Jacob changed about his father was his alignment, deleting that parameter of: &quot;Neutral Neutral&quot; otherwise known as &quot;True Neutral&quot; and typed in: &quot;Chaotic Evil&quot;, just to increase the chances to have his father make all the moves, which got a rise out of Jacob, loving the idea of being submissive to his father. He changed other parameters as well, like: build to powerlifter; cock to soda can thick and the length to a nice seven inches circumcised; precum production to leaky faucet and cum production to excessive, not really wanting to specify an exact quantity, which could limit the results. Then Jacob noticed other parameters like: the target being aware of the new reality, which he entered no; the target being aware of what he was, which he entered yes because he wanted his dad to know he was a werewolf... he thought it&#39;d be more fun that way;  and finally the target being subject to angelic or demonic transformation based on the target&#39;s choices, which he changed from no to yes. That last one sounded even more fun and more interesting since Jacob already changed his dad to be chaotic evil.<br />
<br />
Just to make sure everything was how he wanted it, Jacob read over the parameters a couple times and then took a deep breath as he clicked around to save the changes because he wanted them to be the same without changes made. Jacob had no idea if any of the changes had worked yet or not because it was his father that was changed and his eyes had been glued to the computer screen. However, the moment he sat back, Jacob noticed that everything was different. His room, his computer, his attire... everything had changed. Instead of the old computer that he had as a hand-me-down from one of his cousins who got a new computer for college and gave the old one to Jacob, he had a brand new Apple iBook that was thousands of dollars to purchase. Curious to see what was there, Jacob scanned the application bar at the bottom and saw all sorts of cool, but very expensive software. His eyes went wide and he panicked when he didn&#39;t see the reality changing game. Quickly Jacob did a search on the computer for the files associated with the game and saw that they didn&#39;t even exist. Immediately he pulled up Google Chrome and did a search for the game, which he found no results for. At that moment the panic subsided and he simply shrugged his shoulders, thinking: &quot;oh well... I wanted this to be permanent and now it is, but I wonder why the game doesn&#39;t exist... all I did was change what species my father was and a few tweaks for him to enjoy his sexual exploits more.&quot; Then, just as suddenly, it hit him. In that moment Jacob remembered that his father, before the changes, worked at a computer software company which specialized in alternate reality video games. It must have been why things were different, he must&#39;ve never worked for that company and thus never made the game. Satisfied with his own conclusions, Jacob closed the browser and smiled as he looked at the image that was on his desktop... which he didn&#39;t notice before in his panic. It was a pornographic image of a burly, decently hairy and muscular guy going through his changes into a werewolf. As he looked at the image for a few more seconds Jacob realized the image was of his own father! He smiled at the fact that his change to his dad worked and he was sexier than ever, but he also wondered how did it get there in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Jake...&quot; A familiar, yet different sounding voice said as Jacob turned in his computer chair and stared at the muscular behemoth of a man in nothing more than a pair of athletic shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey dad! Morning to you.&quot; He said a bit scared and worried, not knowing how his father would take the image so largely displayed on the very large computer screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why so bashful Jake? Don&#39;t like the picture I put on your computer as your fourteenth birthday gift?&quot; His father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y... you put that there? Really...?&quot; Jacob asked astonished and beside himself, wondering exactly how much he changed just by what he changed about his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup! I sure did! Look... I know you are gay and I know you have had the hots for me ever since you started going through puberty, even though you never came out and said it. I mean... how could you, right? How could you tell your own father that you are sexually attracted to him? I noticed all the glances, the lingering stares, the look in your eyes and face when you thought I caught you looking... I knew what it meant and it doesn&#39;t bother me one bit.&quot; He said as he walked closer to where I was sitting in my chair. &quot;I also wanted you to know what I was... I figured since you were old enough you should know. As you can see... I am a werewolf.&quot; He said smiling, showing off his perfectly white and slightly sharper than before lower and upper bicuspids.<br />
<br />
&quot;For real!?! That&#39;s not photoshopped... that&#39;s really you?!&quot; Jacob asked, playing along being the only one to know the previous reality with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, pretty cool right? I figured you should also know what you had the potential to become.&quot; He said walking even closer to Jacob, allowing him to see his thick beer can for a cock pressing against the fabric of his shorts. Jake blushed at the thought, having only stated for a soda can thickness... not beer can, but that was even better! Cans of beer, especially ones that his dad drank, were some of the thickest and widest cans out there, which must&#39;ve been why the computer applied those changes because of what his father was known to habitually drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah, it is! Though... what do you mean by &#39;had the potential to become&#39;?&quot; Jake asked inquisitively but also confused... not that he was even complaining.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you eyeing my monster down there... nice... isn&#39;t it?&quot; He asked with a predatory grin. &quot;However, to answer your question, I have to explain some things. First of all, me being a werewolf doesn&#39;t mean you would become one. Yes... it&#39;s already automatically in your DNA, but it isn&#39;t necessarily active, though I suspect it is in part because of your attraction to me and your affinity for werewolves. We are thought only to exist in fiction, but the truth is, we do exist... rather a werewolf exists. Lycanthropy is a generational thing in males in our family... my father made me a werewolf at your age, on my fourteenth birthday as his father did to him and on through our ancestry. We have existed as the only werewolves in existence, in secret, because we were too afraid to increase our numbers. Now... I am the only werewolf because I have other plans and I slaughtered all of my male predecessors that were still alive, engorging on their hearts in my wolf form. Unlike what movies and mythology books state about werewolves, none of it is true. We can change when we want. We pass on lycanthropy through sexual means... not a bite or scratch... that would be too messy and too hard to control. We are also immortal, to a point, but we can be killed by our own kind.&quot; His father, Logan, explained deviously grinning from pointed ear to pointed ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you killed them?!&quot; Jake asked, his voice full of arousal and not disgust, like one would normally expect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh... you like that don&#39;t you Jake?! Turns you on thinking about slaughtering your own family for the sake of your personal glory?&quot; Logan asked as his cock throbbed in his shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck... I... I do...&quot; Jake moaned, &quot;but I&#39;d never slaughter you if I were like you.&quot; Jake added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s fantastic news Jake because I&#39;d never become weak like them... leaving our kind to live in obscurity, never taking our species where we belonged... at the top of the food chain. No... ever since my father turned me, I have had different plans and once I was strong enough to kill them all... I did. This is why when you asked what happened to your grandparents, I simply told you they were dead. Before you ask, yes... that does mean I had sex with my father at your age to become what I am. As you will when we have sex... which I know you&#39;ve wanted for a couple years.&quot; Logan said grinning as he stepped away from Jake and went to sit on his bed, legs opened, his hands placed on his thighs just looking at his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... that explains what happened to my grandfather... and I guess other grandfathers before him, but what about my grandmother and my mother. You never said where my mother was.&quot; Jake said feeling aroused and so turned on by everything he was learning, not caring that his father was a true monster. He did make him chaotic evil, after all, and he didn&#39;t like the idea of werewolves being weak, cuddly beings that some in the media made them out to be... like in &quot;Twilight&quot;. The werewolf, to Jake, is and always has been a monster. Seeing that he made that true was all the more arousing to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother, your grandmother, and all the others before are killed by us when our male children are born. No female survives the birth of our own children. Now, let me explain that too. When we werewolves mate, to have children, we do so with a human female. We cannot mate with a female werewolf because they don&#39;t exist. Genetically, when lycanthropy is introduced into their blood stream to turn them through them swallowing our semen first, it begins to kill them from the inside out... kind of like what you see with Ebola. So... they cannot be made into werewolves before the pregnancy. Also, when we impregnate a woman, the genetic instructions in our semen make for a human baby, which is always male, with lycanthropic genetic markers. Just that little bit of lycanthropic genetics introduced into a female through insemination begins to kill them, but a lot slower because of how the semen is introduced. Over the course of the pregnancy, which is shorter than the human nine months because of what we are, their bodies become sicker and sicker. When we are born, it basically looks like the woman is dying, the baby is born prematurely, but with no health issues. Once we, as infants, are out of the female... they are on death&#39;s door because of the toll our births take out on them. To put them out of their misery, it is our job as the male and as a werewolf, we turn and kill them. With your birth, I am sure you&#39;d be happy to hear... I didn&#39;t just turn and rip her throat out as the rest of us did... no... I slaughtered her and fed on her body. That is how a true werewolf feeds!&quot; He explained with a sinister grin on his face and his eyes taking on what looked like a crimson glow.<br />
<br />
Jake couldn&#39;t help to admit, but hearing what his own father did to his mother turned him on more. This was strange, but not unwelcome, since before the alterations in the game that never existed in this made up reality... Jacob would&#39;ve been shocked and frightened by all of this. Instead... in this reality... it was all natural and the chaotic evil in his father must&#39;ve transferred into Jake. It was something Jake didn&#39;t plan for... hell... he didn&#39;t plan for any of this, but at the same time... how could he. He made his father a werewolf, never specifying when, which the program took and ran with it creating this new reality. Jake couldn&#39;t have been happier because, in this reality, he was getting exactly what he fantasized about. Jake was going to become a werewolf. Jake was going to have sex with his father, which in the end would result in his becoming a werewolf. All of it was perfect and Jake wouldn&#39;t have things any other way.<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot; Jake paused, not knowing what to say or how to say it, though the arousal coming from him and his own hard, throbbing member should have been answer enough.<br />
<br />
Seeing how his son reacted to the truth, Logan grinned again as he stood and walked toward his son. &quot;I know that turned you on, didn&#39;t it son? To hear I slaughtered our weak family. To hear I tore your mother to pieces and ate her. That&#39;s all making you hot and bothered, I can see it... and I am sure you can see it too!&quot; He said getting closer as Jake could see that the cock in his shorts was even thicker somehow. &quot;Yeah... you do see it. See... since I slaughtered everyone, which was actually forbidden among our people to prevent what I have become... I took on their individual power, which meant that the more aroused I am, the thicker I am down there. I bet you want to see it... don&#39;t you son?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I... do... I really do!&quot; Jake said breathing heavier as he became more and more aroused. &quot;Just... what did you mean, what you&#39;ve become?&quot; Jake asked as his right hand slowly moved down to play with his genitals as his left moved up to tease and toy with his erogenous nipples.<br />
<br />
Logan grinned as his eyes flashed crimson again, this time his eyes taking on more of the same crimson hue... not just a glow. &quot;See... I have become something my father and his father told stories of when each of us were your age. The story of &#39;The Dark One&#39;. Basically, a long, long time ago... werewolves were the dominant race on the earth. We lived on a large continent, all of its own, where we ruled over humanity. No one would come to our island continent unless ordered by us. No werewolf would leave to live with the humans, but we would leave and come back in order to make sure everything was going as our race had intended. We would, however, take on new human men to turn and add to our ranks every now and then because human population was growing as well. However... that all was because of one werewolf who the others feared... simply known as &#39;The Dark One&#39; whose actual name was Agamemnon. He did what the others had always talked about, but never had the guts to actually do it. He slaughtered hundreds of his kin, werewolves who had the same vision Agamemnon had and looked to him to make come true, to become a demonic god in order to put humans where they belonged. The details of everything else was lost to time as my ancestors... the surviving members of that time... had handed the story down verbally before the written word became a thing... thanks to humans thriving unchecked. However... the other detail that survived was that Agamemnon&#39;s evil was too great for the rest of werewolf kind to endure and thousands rose up against him till one werewolf... my lineage... took advantage of Agamemnon being overpowered in number and ripped his throat out. Thus it brought about the end of his rule... which all of the surviving werewolves were happy about and continued to live the way Agamemnon set forth. However, another detail survived, which was that in time without Agamemnon to be there and lead our people... werewolves became complacent and stopped putting humanity in check. Humans who knew of werewolf kind existing set out to find a way to kill us... to exterminate us. As I said before, no werewolf can be killed by any other means than one werewolf killing another. One werewolf, also a part of my lineage, told humans how to kill us and then showed them it was possible by sacrificing himself, sinking his own claws into his throat and ripped it out. Then, with the instructions he gave them, one who was the first hunter cut off his arms from the elbow down, hollowed out the flesh so that he could wear my ancestor&#39;s flesh like a suit and then eventually caught another werewolf off guard and killed him, thus allowing another human the means to kill us. Eventually, they killed every last werewolf, except for my surviving ancestor who went into hiding as the coward that he was. However, his cowardice and his story telling have all led up to this point... the point where the werewolf would rise in triumph again. Now... now that I am like Agamemnon... there is only one detail and that is where you come in, son. If you have sex with me, which I know you want to, my dark seed will make you a dark werewolf as well.&quot;</p>
