<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For Kellies friends it was perhaps the most surreal day of school any of them had ever experienced. No one seemed to notice that there were now two Katies attending school. As the school day ended the girls decided to they should all sit down to talk at Kellies.<br />
<br />
Merlin was lazily sitting in his easy chair reading as the girls bounded into the house. Narrowing his brow he stared at his jubilant apprentice and another Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything ok,&quot; he asked cautiously as the large group of teens entered his home.  Kellie smiled warmly as she guided Alt Katie towards the ancient wizard. &quot;Everything is fine,&quot; she said happily. &quot;Katie is just visiting, she&#39;s here to help us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin looked between Katie and Kellie giving the two a questioning look. &quot;Okay,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;Just...be careful, were crossing into rarely ventured magical territory. Whatever you two do try not to interfer too greatly in the others universe.&quot; Kellie and Alt Katie happily nodded as the girls made their way into the living room.<br />
<br />
As the girls settled in Kellie introduced Alt Katie to Mary Elise and Karen. As she explained she was from a different timeline, one in which Kellie had not made a universe altering mistake. Alt Katie was now here to help Kellie, not only because of her deep connection to Kellie but also out of fear for her little sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait in you timeline I&#39;m your kid sister,&quot; Lisa exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No not exactly,&quot; Alt Katie said sheepishly. &quot;In my timeline....your my aunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa&#39;s jaw dropped as she looked between Kellie and Alt Katie. &quot;Your aunt,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;How the hell did that happen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alt Katie shrugged, causing Kellie to step forward. &quot;It&#39;s true Lisa,&quot; Kellie stated. &quot;In my original timeline you were Katie&#39;s aunt and Kumiko was your best friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa now gawked at Kumiko who gave her a nod. &quot;Yeah apparently we were all grown-up in her timeline,&quot; she said. &quot;You ans me apparently worked in the fashion industry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How the hell could you not tell me this Kumi,&quot; Lisa yelled. Kumi frowned as she now glared back at her best friend. &quot;Seriously like you would of believed me if I told you straight up?!&quot; Lisa opened her mouth before quickly closing it, Kumi had a point she wouldn&#39;t of believd it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Lisa sighed shaking her head. &quot;So, Im your aunt. Im gueasing that means your mom is alive and had more kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Alt Katie said sadly. &quot;My mom died wgen I was born. It was...you..that took care of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa went pale as she took this information. &quot;S..so,&quot; she stammered. &quot;I...I have a daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Step daughter,&quot; Alt Katie stated. &quot;Her name is Gloria Turner. Shes the one in possession of the Ring of Age now.&quot;<br />
<br />
It took Lisa a few moments to process the name after hearing it. The name sounded so familiar. Soon though it dawned on her what this Katie was saying.  Lisa&#39;s eyes went wide as she stared at Alt Katie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; she whisperd. &quot;Gloria Turner, is that...is that in any way related to Jason Turner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alt Katie smiled as she looked at the stunned teen. &quot;Yes Lisa,&quot; she giggled. &quot;My Gloria is the daughter of Jason Turner. Congratulations it was a beautiful wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa swooned slightly as she took this in. I. That other reality not only was she an adult she was married to her current boyfriend and was even a step mom. &quot;I...I need a drink of water,&quot; she croaked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you freaking out,&quot; Kumiko giggled. &quot;At least you know you and Jason make it. Id be thrilled about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa gave ger friend a sideways glance as she tried to collect herself. Alt Karie toom this in, smiling impishly at the Asian teen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know your married too Kumi,&quot; she grinned.<br />
<br />
Kumiko stopped dead as she stared at Alt Katie. &quot;Whaaaa!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its true,&quot; Alt Katie said impishly. &quot;In fact not only are you married you have a baby now too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it was Lisa&#39;s turn to giggle as the color drained from Kumiko&#39;s face. Kumiko frowned as she pushed her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;So who is she marries too,&quot; Mika asked, gazing at her twin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny you should ask Mika,&quot; Katie grinned. &quot;Because it just so happens to be one of Claudia&#39;s brothers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia, Mika,  and Kumiko now gawked at one another. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it Derrick,&quot; Kumiko whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually its Cole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cole,&quot; the three girls exclaimed, cauaing Alt Katie to laugh.  Kumiko now pictured Claudias older brother Cole. She had met him on a couple if occasions and had not even considered him anything special. Kumiko remembered him as a towering guy with a crew cut who was way too serious for her. She wondered how even an alternate version of herself could of settled for someone who seemed so straight laced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Katie Ive think youve freaked them out enough,&quot; Kellie giggled. Alt Katie sighed, smiling and nodding. &quot;Okay Kel your right,&quot; she said. &quot;Besides we have more important things to discuss. But before I do hope you don&#39;t mind me changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded as Alt Katie touched her necklace once more. The girls watched as the teen began to grow once more. Alt Katie grew slightly as her face matured while her curves began to fill out once more. On only seconds the girl was once more in her 20s. Smiling in satisfaction she ran her hands over her body, noticing the teens in front of her gawking at her mature appearance. Alt Katie couldn&#39;t help but grin mischieviously at the uoung teens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; she said devilishly, trying to get the girls to focus. &quot;As much fun as it is telling you about your alternate selves, what I really need to do is help Mary Elise.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls now slowly turned noticing the grumoy looking redhead sitting on the couch. &quot;Ugh,&quot; she groaned. &quot;Why am I that important that you would cross over dimensions to help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not so much you Mary,&quot; Katie said flatly. &quot;Its your ring and more specifically the sorceress that gave it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan le Fay,&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
Alt Katie nodded. &quot;Yeah her. I have a theory that she may try to go after Gloria. She&#39;s young and still doesn&#39;t have alot of experience with the ring. If I can cross over to see you, chances are she can do the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls now looked from one other slowly begining to grasp the seriousness of Alt Katie&#39;s concerns.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you want us to do,&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
Alt Katie rubbed her chin thoughtfully as she gazed at the teens. &quot;Look,&quot; she said calmly. &quot;I..I know things are different here than where I&#39;m from but I do kniw that you are stronger together than apart. Mary, Morgan la Fay will try to turn you towards your darkest impulses. You have to resist. If you use your ring maliciously you coukd not onky destroy this world but mine as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise remained quiet as she listendd to Alt Katie. She didn&#39;t kniw if she ciuld handle this much reaponsibility. Alt Katie could see the concern in her eyes as she approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know its alot to handle,&quot; she said, hugging the girl. &quot;You may not believe it but the girls here in front if you arr your greatest strength. They may be slightly different from the ones I know but thwir still somw of the best people I have ever met. You just all have to give eachother a chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alt Katie now looked the teens over as they gave eachother uncertain looks. She appeared ro have made a break through and hoped that by giving them a nudge the girls would come together, for the sake if both their worlds they needed to.</p>
