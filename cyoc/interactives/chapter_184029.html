<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Got it,&quot; John announced as he walked into the house. His wife was busy making lunch while the kids were running around doing something else. He leaned in and gave her a nice peck on the cheek. &quot;Still lovely as always.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm-hmmm,&quot; Amanda smiled softly. A shiver had gone down her spine but she tried to ignore it. John was just about always ready for sex, but they couldn&#39;t do it all the time. Even as his strong hands traced up and down her smooth body, she knew she had to resist her urges. Though the occasional sound would come out. That seemed to be enough of a &#39;win&#39; for her husband and he backed off after giving a second kiss to the nape of her neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Later?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Later,&quot; she confirmed. However, even as he went out the back door, she had to touch herself ever so gently as another shiver ran down her spine. It was the least she could do to try to get that feeling to go down. Even if it was only momentarily.<br />
<br />
John headed outside to his shed. He pulled out the lawnmower and a few tools to help change the spark plug. &quot;There we go,&quot; he said. A sense of satisfaction ran through him as he finished the job. &quot;Now it&#39;s just time to cut the grass.&quot; Looking over his rural home, he never expected to be able to have such a large yard. But since they had moved fairly far out, he and his wife were able to afford a pretty nice place. It was just a bit of a hassle to keep up with all the yardwork. <br />
<br />
However, looking next door, he couldn&#39;t imagine how Dave was able to keep up with everything that he did. There were potters placed in perfect rows along the side walk. And his grass was always trimmed and mowed like a professional was doing it. Not to mention how he seemed to keep the siding of his house from looking old or any of the wood on his deck or terrace from rotting. John might not have ever really noticed if not for Dave&#39;s bragging.<br />
<br />
It was never upfront or direct, but there were small jabs. Things like, &#39;looks like your grass could be cut,&#39; or &#39;you know if you ever need help with anything, I&#39;m right next door.&#39; Yes, it&#39;s the sign of a nice neighbor. It would have been a welcome saying from anyone. But, when it came from Dave, it always seemed to be implying something else. Something like John wasn&#39;t good enough at taking care of his house. Or that John couldn&#39;t actually do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Howdy neighbor,&quot; Dave waved over to him. His large body waddled over to the fence. Despite being so meticulous about his yard, somehow Dave never seemed to stay in shape. He leaned his hefty body down against the chain link fence. &quot;Wasn&#39;t sure if you were ever going to get your grass cut. But it&#39;s a good thing that you&#39;re doing it today. Weatherman says it&#39;s supposed to rain.&quot;<br />
<br />
The chuckle in the other man&#39;s voice only drove John even angrier. &quot;Yeah. Just needed to get a new spark plug. Old one went out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Too bad. You know I have a few extras. I could have given it to you if you needed it,&quot; Dave offered. &quot;Never hurts to be prepared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; John grit his teeth, trying his best not to take it personally. There were just always those little tiny jabs, intentional or not that dug deep at him. &quot;But I didn&#39;t want to be a bother. Besides, it gave me a reason to go out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything not to look after those kids, eh?&quot; Dave chuckled again. <br />
<br />
John didn&#39;t know if the man was just socially inept or actually thought he was funny. Either way, John didn&#39;t like it. &quot;Anyways,&quot; he asserted. &quot;I need to get this done. Before the rain.&quot; Then pointed up to the sky as some clouds were starting to form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Dave smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t let me hold you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; John said through gritted teeth. However, Dave didn&#39;t go inside. Instead, he took a seat in a lawn chair. One that was pointed directly towards John. &#39;Is this some kind of fetish for him?! My God!&#39; John screamed inside his head. However, that seemed to give him an idea. Normally John would pull out his phone and just start listening to music. Even with someone like Dave watching him, he could still zone out and think about something else. But now he could have a little fun.<br />
<br />
John started typing away. &#39;Dave only ever wears a poser around the house.&#39; He hit enter, watching the neighbor&#39;s clothes slowly disappear. John was thinking that he would remove his shirt and clothes. But instead it was just like he&#39;d never been wearing clothes to begin with. His large unkempt body was on full display. The heavy set belly and massive moobs were in front of him while his flabby arms rested in his chair. Dave wasn&#39;t even wearing shoes. The bottom of his feet looked a bit rough. <br />
<br />
&quot;Having trouble?&quot; Dave asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, just can&#39;t find the right song,&quot; John said. A smirk filled his face as Dave didn&#39;t act like anything was different. His entire body was on display and he was acting as though it were any other Saturday. But John wasn&#39;t done yet. &#39;Dave actually has a 9% body fat while still weighing the same. His cock is just merely 2 inches long but incredibly easy to turn on and release. His favorite masturbatory material is watching me do anything.&#39; John snickered at the thought, &#39;At least now he would have a reason to watch me all the time.&#39;<br />
<br />
As Dave sat in his chair, the makeup of his body started to change. The heavy amount of fat that he had garnered over the years was tightening up into dense muscle. And at 270 pounds, that was really saying something. Now instead of being bloated with heavy amounts of fat, he was bloated with unbelievable amounts of muscle. His arms were absolutely massive slabs of meat. The soft chest that had rested on his belly now tightened into two strong slabs, though with how much they pushed out, any sort of movement would still make them bounce. His belly tightened up against his body forming 6 solid blocks. But it wasn&#39;t completely flat as it looked far more like a roid gut than thin abs.<br />
<br />
Dave had to widen the way he sat at his thick quads would have crushed anything between them. He&#39;d still have to walk with a bit of a waddle, but now it was because the dense muscle would be rubbing up against each other. Down just below them were diamond shaped quads and feet that looked far too large to fit into a normal shoe. He&#39;d probably have to get them specially made as they had to be massive to hold up his massive frame.<br />
<br />
John tried his best not to look to obviously. But he couldn&#39;t believe his handiwork. Dave barely fit in the chair he was sitting in before. Now, he somehow looked even bigger. However, John still had to mow his lawn. He pulled the rope to start it and it started right up. <br />
<br />
One of Dave&#39;s hands went to his crotch. It was large enough to hold 100 pound weights with ease. But with such a small thing to hold onto it was rather hard to deal with. His thumb was bigger than what was between his legs. That didn&#39;t seem to stop Dave in the slightest. He pawed at his crotch, absentmindedly as John mowed his lawn. &quot;Oh gawd...&quot; he moaned. The longer he watched John mowing the lawn, the more aroused he became. It was impossible for him to think of anything else.<br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s muscles flexed as he writhed in his lawn chair. Each one bulging with incredible power. Yet he was too weak to stop. His body craved the attention. The joy he got from watching the other man take care of his yard was incredibly. He couldn&#39;t look away. His toes curled up in his perfectly trimmed grass, flexing as he tried to keep himself from finishing. But it wasn&#39;t much help. Dave&#39;s head flew back as his dick released inside of his poser. It always felt like torrents of cum flooded out of him, but it was barely even a drizzle. Women would always be so impressed with his massive body, but then not so much when they&#39;d see the rest of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay over there?&quot; John stopped mowing his lawn for a moment, waving at Dave. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; Dave called back. Though a clear stain was showing through his poser. John didn&#39;t seem to react. Only a bit of a smirk showed from the side of his mouth, then he went back to working on his lawn. Dave felt the arousal fill his body again. &#39;This was better than any of those women,&#39; he thought as he continued to please himself several more times before John finally finished.</p>
