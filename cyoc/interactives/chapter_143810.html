<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh what about them,” Ann said excitedly. Jackie turned to where Ann was pointing, a small smirk spreading across her face. “Perfect,” she said.<br />
<br />
The two teens gazed at a group of six seniors around 70 years old occupying a lane nearby. As the girls watched they could see that the six were obviously married and enjoying a night out. Ann and Jackie watched as the elderly men now bowled while two elderly women sat and watched, occasionally taking a sip of beer from the bottles they had nearby. The two men seemed to have been friends for quite sometime as they chatted, not payin particularly close attention to the game. Finally the two teens noticed the third couple that were sitting quite close to one another, lovingly staring at one another.<br />
<br />
“Bet they were a lot of fun back in the day,” Jackie said. Ann nodded as she continued to watch. “Definitely,” she said. “Especially that couple sitting at the table. That’s so cute that they act like that at their age.”<br />
<br />
“What do you think they were like 50 years ago,” Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
Ann smirked as she could only imagine how the romantic couple acted in their youth. “They probably acted in a way your to young to see,” she giggled. Jackie playfully shoved her girlfriend giving her a faux annoyed look. “Oh look at you tryIng to act all mature. In case you hadn’t noticed were the same age right now.”<br />
<br />
“True,” Ann smiled. “But my birthdays coming up in the summer. You just had yours, meaning I turn 16 before you do so nah.” Ann playfully stuck her tongue out at Jackie, causing the brunette teen to laugh. “Brat,” she giggled. “Now let’s see what they looked like in their 20s before I change my mind and turn you into my kid sister.”<br />
<br />
Ann nodded in agreement as she snuggled up next to her girlfriend as she made her wish. The teens watched as the elderly couples now began to age backwards.<br />
<br />
The two elderly men shivered as they began growing younger. The first man was a heavier man with white hair and a thick beard while the the second man was thinner with glasses and wispy grey hair. As the two aged backwards Ann and Jackie watched as they changed. The heavier man began to lose his beer gut as his hair began to brighten in color. The girls watched as his white hair crept forward, filling in as his small bald spots were erased. By the time he hit his 50s the girls could see he was a barrel chested man with light brown hair. The mans friend transformation was equally interesting as his body strengthened. The mans body began to become more muscular, while his grey hair became coal black.<br />
<br />
As the two men continued to age backwards they watched as their bodies continued to youthen, becoming stronger and less aged. The heavier mans gut had almost vanished completely as he reentered his 30s while his friend looked like a lean yet muscular man. The men’s faces smoothed as wrinkles and age spots vanished. The dark haired man took off his glasses as he was now able to see more clearly without them. As the men crept through their 20s the girls watched as their faces became more youthful and energized. By the time the two men became 21, Ann and Jackie were surprised to see two handsome college age men. The heavier man now was a beast of an individual with light brown hair and a beard that appeared to have thinned slightly from his elderly years. The other man was now a tall, dark haired man with a youthful and handsome face and an athletic looking body.<br />
<br />
The men’s wives also went through an extraordinary change as they youthened. The heavier set mans wife was a smaller woman with grey hair and glasses. Ann and Jackie had noticed the woman seemed to be a bit more energetic than her friend, who Ann and Jackie could see was a quieter woman who the girls believed to be the typical grandmother who would knit blankets for her grandchildren. As they aged backwards they watched as the women began to become more energetic. The smaller woman’s air bega to regain its color going from grey to honey blond while her friends hair seemed to regain a luxurious chocolate brown that glowed as she grew younger. By the time the women hit their 30s they noticed the more energetic woman begin to talk quite loudly as she encouraged her husband to win. The other woman seemed to laugh playfully with her friend as she buried her face in her hand, surprised by her energetic companions actions.<br />
<br />
The two women seemed to become more energetic as they grew younger. Ann and Jackie could see that the honey haired woman was a bit of a live wire in her youth and a bit of a jokester as she playfully chucked peanuts at her husband (now boyfriend) as her brunette friend laughed and tried to tell her to stop. As the two women became 20, Ann and Jackie beheld two college beauties. One an energetic honey haired prankster and the other a dark brunette beauty who was trying to control her friend. “They look like a lot of fun,” Ann smirked as she watched the two couples bowl. “Yeah but take a look at them,” Jackie said as she pointed to the romantic couple.<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie had watched the couple as they regressed from a loving elderly couple to young college coeds. The woman’s natural black hair color slowly replaced the the grey while the mans hair gradually returned having previously been bald. By the time the couple reached their 40s the mans hair was now full and blond while the woman’s hair had become fuller and healthier. The couple were now also more energetic as they lovingly kissed each other. As they dropped further in age the teens watched as they began kissing each other more passionately as the man pulled the woman closer to him. When the two had finished regressing the two teens beheld two 21 year olds who were obviously very passionate about eachother.<br />
<br />
The young couple were actively making out with eachother. The man had pulled his young girlfriend into his lap with one hand cupping the girls ass while his other hand freely roamed ovr the rest of her body. The girl for her part returned her boyfriends passion, nibbling on the mans ear while she dug her nails into his back. The young lovers gazed longingly into eachothers eyes. Ann could tell that the couple were obviously anxious to find a more intimate place and end their bowling night very soon.<br />
<br />
“Wow Those two are something else,” Jackie stated in awe. “Their practically dry humping eachother right in the bowling alley.” Ann could only giggle as she looked at her girlfriend. “Guess their just passionate,” Ann chuckled. “But it’s cute in a way. Nice to know they love eachother so much.”<br />
<br />
Jackie nodded in agreement as she squeezed her girlfriends hand. While she wa nowhere near as flamboyant as those two, she felt just as passionate about Ann. “So angel,” Jackie asked. “What should we do now?”</p>
