<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake panted, exhausted and terrified from trying to rip the hair off his body.  He continued to stare into the full-length mirror.  How could the best thing that ever happened to him turn into such an irreparable nightmare?  <br />
<br />
He realized what a fool he'd been in trusting the djinn to grant his wishes.  Anything he said would be taken to the extreme.  <br />
<br />
He thought of the genie's unfeeling eyes.  Drake had figured it out.  The djinn would tempt him with his heart's desire, then, once the wish had been granted in the most grotesque manner possible, the magical creature would hover over him and sanctimoniously condemn him for harboring these secret desires to transform his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't make any more wishes,&quot; Drake thought.  &quot;Who knows what the genie will do to me?  I've got to try and fix this on my own.  I've gotta HIDE this.&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes looked past the full-length mirror into the closet. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can do this.  I can do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake reached inside and pulled out a pair of slacks and a button-up shirt and blazer.  With great difficulty, he managed to slip both feet inside the slacks.  Due to the new amount of hair on his legs, pulling the trousers up was next to impossible and extremely uncomfortable as the hairs were pushed &quot;against the grain&quot; as one pant leg, then another was pulled up.<br />
<br />
Hair spilled out over the waist of his pants.  Drake used his hands to tuck it in as best he could.  He mostly succeeded, then thoughtlessly zipped up his trousers.<br />
<br />
&quot;OWWWWW!&quot;  A big clump of hair from his arm and stomach were painfully tangled within the zipper.  Drake doubled over immediately to give the hair more slack and slowly, carefully pulled the zipper back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have to deal with that later,&quot; he thought.  Drake's heart was still racing at the prospect of being permanently hairy, but he was trying to remain as calm and casual as he could manage.  He sucked in and ONLY JUST managed to button the slacks.<br />
<br />
A quick glance at his freakishly hairy body in trousers gave Drake a swell of discouragement, but before he really studied his clothed body and passed judgment, he decided he'd better go ahead and finish dressing.<br />
<br />
The button-up shirt barely fit.  The threads of the sleeves made little popping noises as he crammed his arms down the sleeves and stuffed the excess hair in after them.  <br />
<br />
Hair dangling in his face, Drake buttoned up the shirt.  The buttons almost wouldn't go.  He found himself pressing firmly down on his thatch of stomach hair so he could get the buttons through their respective holes.<br />
<br />
Finally, Drake lifted his beard up and out of the way, resting it on the back of his arm so he could finish buttoning.<br />
<br />
The neck had always been a little tight, but now, it was utterly impossible to button not just the top button, but the second button as well, thanks to the hair of his neck, chest, and beard.<br />
<br />
The blazer was last.  Like the shirt and slacks, Drake could barely get the jacket on.  It was as if he had gained fifty pounds, only the mass he gained was entirely in HAIR.<br />
<br />
Dressing complete, Drake looked in the mirror.  <br />
<br />
Hair was pouring out from everywhere.  From his pant legs.  From his zipper which was still down, from his waist, from the space in between every button on his shirt--not that THAT mattered too much.  His humongous beard covered most of his torso anyway.  His hands weren't much better and the hair on his wrists sloppily sprung from his cuffs.<br />
<br />
Drake felt drained.  He just stood there.  His vision became blurred.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God.  More hair?&quot; he thought.  But it wasn't hair.  It was tears.<br />
<br />
He had tried to conceal the hair that was growing all over him.  He had hoped beyond hope that maybe putting clothes on, the hair would be less noticeable.  He might even be able to LIVE this way.<br />
<br />
It was becoming increasingly apparent that a normal life was going to be impossible.  What's more, it was hot.  He hadn't counted on that.  He lifted up his beard to try and give his neck some air, but to no avail.  There was no skin TO air out.  Only hair.  <br />
<br />
He felt suffocated.  Emotion began to swell inside of him.  It wasn't fair.  He hadn't asked for this.  He had been tricked.  Fear and desperation gave way to anger as Drake...</p>
