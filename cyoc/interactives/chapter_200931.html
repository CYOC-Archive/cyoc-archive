<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In that morning with his member still covered in cum he walked out of the stall and shook his mane of all the straw that was in his hair. He descended quite a ways to get to the houses where he was greeted by his father who said.<br />
Paul! This is your lucky day, you might not have to plow the land after all. We have received an offer by the bakery to have you pull their flower from the mill to the baking house.<br />
Paul:  Snort..... Pufff<br />
OK let&#39;s go.<br />
You know what father, I think I&#39;ll take Paul to the bakery, said Mark. We have a lot of stuff to discuss.<br />
As Mark said that he placed a rug type material on Paul&#39;s back as he lead him out of the grounds and out of the front gate.<br />
He got on Paul back and started a light trot towards the bakery making Mark jump up and down on Paul back.<br />
So, you are finally getting closer to rhe bakery, how do you feel?<br />
Paul whickered as he understood what he was talking about.<br />
He picked up the pace and in no time he was at the bakery where he was greeted by David with a towel filled with flower.<br />
They said their welcomes and got down to business setting the hourly wage.<br />
David realised that he forgot something and grabbed his head with his hands.<br />
I forgot the flour this mourning, I&#39;m going to need to strap Paul up to the gringing crate.<br />
Mark was happy to say yes on his behalf and Paul was brought to the grinding mill in which he was strapped immediately. As David was strapping the gear onto him he puffed in sign he was ready for work.<br />
Both Mark and David left him to spin in circles grinding the wheat grain into a small powder.<br />
As he was spinning and spinning, he only heard his hooves clopping on the soft dirt around the grinder getting easier and easier as it went his mind wondered to other thoughts and his member became fully errect. A few seconds later a &quot;zing&quot; sound was heard and he saw Madame Illusia on one of the side benches in the mill staring at his errection.<br />
Well Paul it appears that you are doing your duties as a draft animal however, by peering into your mind I see that you have other type of aspirations brewing inside of you, she said looking at his member, am I right?<br />
Paul nodded silently. You see, I made you a stallion, however you heve aspirations of being mounted despite this, am I right?<br />
Paul nodded again while looking down at his front hooves with the shadow of his errect member poking in between them as he stopped spinning.<br />
There is no problem with this, it&#39;s just that horses are at the end of the day animals and they need to reproduce. Your DNA is rather a special one because you were human and it would benefit the equine race quite a lot.<br />
Now we&#39;re were we? Oh yes!<br />
Madame took out a staff and pointed it at the shadow of his errect member in between his forehooves. We can make it as such that this shadow disappears if you catch my drift. Paul was increasingly hard at this point and listened carefully.<br />
We can also make it that a certain David receives this same shadow that you lost in between his legs.<br />
Paul was breathing heavily at this point marking his increase in heart beat.<br />
Of course it would mean that you would&#39;t be the big and hung draft horse anymore, David would.And your position on 4 legs would become permanent even while mating.<br />
Paul was trobbing at this point and Madame saw that he was very close to cumming, while smiling she said.<br />
All you have to do to submit to him is to transfer your male essence to him by cumming on the wheat you are crunching beneath your 4 hooves. He will consume the tainted wheat as bread and your metamorfosis will be passed onto him, residing your 4 hooves to be on the ground 100% of the time. <br />
Madame smiled while saying: Come on Paul, I know you want it, you are on the edge of the biggest orgasm you ever had just by imagining yourself under that stallion. <br />
Madame grabbed his member and felt how much blood and how fast it was flowing through his member and whispered in his ear. <br />
At the end of the Day Paul who do you think could use this member at its full potential, you or him? <br />
Wheeeeneeeedeehiiihhhhiiiiiieeeeeee huf hufff neeeeeeehiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeiiieeee, nickering, nickering huf huf............. <br />
At that precise moment Madame felt Paul Member tensing up and a jet of cum started flowing through it that revirberated through his member. <br />
She started guiding the stream into the batch of whole grain wheat that David was going to consume while she was simultaneously patting his side saying: Good girl!...Pat Pat.<br />
As he was still cumming his member started to become more flaccid as it started to move further down until positioning firmly under his tail. <br />
His nickering started again as his member started to quiver and suck itself into his body bit by bit and he was huffing intensely, at some point the continuous sliding motion as his member retracted in combination with his vivid imagination of what he was getting in between his legs triggered another orgasm which rocked his body, Madame amplifiing it just for the kicks of seeing his struggle as he was pumping his pelvis forward, while saying:it&#39;s a bit late for that, don&#39;t you think you should let others do that to you? <br />
As she said that his balls were sucked into his abdomen and his remaining member retreated bit by bit into 2 folds situated firmly below his tail. <br />
Paul was still huffing very hard however as he tried to move he didn&#39;t feel his member swaying from side to side at the thaught of being mounted. <br />
Madame smiled and started to rub her hand on his belly where his member should have been causing his to shudder at the realization that she was scratching and patting smooth skin. She also opened up the blind which brought the light back in between his legs however the protruding shadow that was there just a few minutes earlier was nowhere to be found. <br />
Paul started mixing the grain again to cover his tracks and whan he completed a revolutionadame was gone. <br />
Eventually Mark and David came back and disconnected Paul from the mill setting him free. <br />
David paid Mark as he mounted Paul to go home the agreed rate while saying:Fine horse you have there Mark, although I could have sworne it was a stallion. My mistake then.<br />
David patted Paul on his nose and said: you beautiful mare, you&#39;re going to get all the stallions. <br />
Mark quickly left out of reflxs to conceal the errection Paul would have generated. <br />
A mare, said Mark, how did you pull that off? It was that lady again wasn&#39;t it? <br />
Paul nickered while being jumpy on his way home realising what was in store for him without that member swinging in between his legs.</p>
