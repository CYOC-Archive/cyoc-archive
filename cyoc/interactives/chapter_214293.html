<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nathan had a big day ahead of him. The 22-year-old finally has a real job, sure it was just an assistant position, but it was with one of the biggest companies in the state. Tech Frontiers, from mobiles to internet modems, to weird and niche devices that make life just a bit easier. It has a good reputation, plenty of chances for promotion, and is the best start Nathan could hope for. He sat on the edge of the bed, setting his alarm, and talking to himself. He was the only person living in his one room apartment, but he kept it to a whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I got this. Just get dressed, catch the bus. 501, remember it. 501. Then we&#39;re good, easy day, and it&#39;ll only get easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
After taking a gulp, he wrapped himself in his blankets, and tried his hardest to sleep. It was a good hour before his body relaxed enough to doze off, but he got all the sleep he needed. Waking in the morning with the birds chirping outside his window, his phone buzzing with alarm going off, 8:00 am. Everything&#39;s going just fine. Nathan getting up and going to the shower. Washing up his rather ordinary self. Thin, standard proportions, and wavey blonde hair. He never could grow a beard, and he needed glasses by 15. Looking nerdy and having some of his interests match the imagine. Loving games, tabletops, and films. The young adult wondering if the other guys at the company would share his interests, it&#39;s a tech place so... maybe. He hoped so at least as he dried up and put on a blue buttoned shirt and black pants. Grabbing one last thing before leaving the apartment and locking the front door, the ID card that was sent to him when the application was accepted. Nathan putting it in his wallet, and then going to the bus stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;500, just remember it&#39;s the 500.&quot;<br />
<br />
He repeated to himself, seeing the 501 pass and then finally the 500. Nathan getting on, nervousness taking over as he accidently taps his ID card on the ticket scanner, before getting out his bus pass and sitting down near the front. Breathing in and out as he looks out the window, and watches as the bus goes in the opposite direction he planned. Nathan starting to panic as he pulls up his phone and looks through his typed notes. Why is he- 501. Oh no, why didn&#39;t he catch the 501. Now he was going to be late. On his first day too. Great way to make an impression, great way to lose your new job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tech Frontiers, right? You&#39;re going the wrong way for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sultry voice greeted Nathan, sitting by his side was a woman around his age. Dressed in a red blouse and blue jeans, brown hair tied back in a ponytail, and eyes looking to his wallet. Did she see his stuff up from earlier? His cheeks went bright red, and he did his best to recover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah haha. Whoops. I&#39;m gonna get off at the next stop. Then just... walk from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Walk? Hah, that&#39;s a good one. You would be walking for an hour before arriving. But, my cars near the next stop. Why don&#39;t I drive you over, hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Why she was offering to drive him didn&#39;t come to mind. Nathan too focused on the fact that this might mean he reaches work on time, and also, he gets to talk to this woman a bit more. He&#39;s never had someone interested in him, maybe she is? The two get off on the next stop and walk to a nearby carpark. A brief introduction exchanged by the two as they make hurried steps to the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Nathan, thanks a heap for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Veronica, and it&#39;s my pleasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
She helps him into the passenger side, getting in the front and starting the car. Driving off, dealing with the morning traffic. Nathan checks the time, 8:40. He&#39;s probably still going to be late, but it&#39;s better than walking. The new starter trying to think of any conversation to have with Veronica as she drives him to work. But she is the first to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, have you worked at Tech Frontiers for long?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it&#39;s um... it&#39;s my first day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Well, we certainly can&#39;t have you being late. They would surely fire you for being late on your first day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... um, but I won&#39;t, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the traffic is pretty bad around here. Maybe a few minutes late, I hope they won&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a taunting tone to Veronica&#39;s voice, and a feeling of failure in Nathan&#39;s being. He really screwed up, one little screwup and that&#39;s it. He&#39;s going to lose the job and have to start searching for work from square one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless of course, you accept a little help from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Help? What sort of help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say me and my friends are very interested in that company of yours. We would love to make a few deals with it, but the CEO is a notorious bore. If you scratch my back, well, you&#39;ll also be scratching your own back.&quot;<br />
<br />
This sounded back. If there&#39;s one thing he knew about corporations like this, it&#39;s that you don&#39;t want to be working for several at once. Was this woman part of a rival company? What was it she was after anyway? Files from them? The CEO&#39;s secrets? Whatever it was, it couldn&#39;t be good, and how could it even help him keep his job?<br />
<br />
&quot;Gone silent, Nathan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry! I just don&#39;t know if I can trust you!&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t mean to say that, but Veronica took it with a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s alright. If you&#39;re going to be fired anyway, why not give it a try?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don&#39;t even know what you want, and I&#39;m pretty sure I could lose a lot more than my job if I steal company secrets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stealing? No, why would I have you steal? This is going to be far simpler, and far more profitable for the both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathans phone went off. 9:00. He was now certainly late, but thankfully only a few streets away from the office. Still, Veronica continued her offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Open the glove box, you should find a small suitcase inside. Take it with you, and use what&#39;s inside on your manager while they scold you for being late.&quot;<br />
<br />
With nothing else to do, Nathan follows the instructions. Opening the suitcase to peer inside and see a row of 20 vials of various colours. From primary, to secondary, to a mix of shades. All neatly arranged, and Nathan seeming confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to poison my manager...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Poison wouldn&#39;t let you keep your job. Let’s just say this makes them more agreeable to the both of us, changes them for the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;U-um... okay. But what one do I use? What do I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Use whatever one you want, and all you need is a little drop. Just a smidge of what&#39;s in those vials needs to be ingested. Through food, drink, or anything else. Now it&#39;s time to get to work, Nathan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Veronica pulls up on the side of the road. The 25-story building right in front of Nathan, his new workplace, and where he&#39;s about to get chewed out for being late. He checks his phone, 9:05, then goes to say thanks to Veronica. But by the time he has turned around, she&#39;s already speeding off down the road. Leaving him with just the suitcase, and a rising sense of dread. Maybe it won&#39;t be too bad, he repeats to himself. Stepping into the lavish lobby with red carpet sprawled across the floor. Guiding himself to the elevator up back, tapping his ID card and going to floor 15. Entering into the small hallway outside the rows of offices, and immediately seeing his manager pacing back and forth in the hall. Henry Dawson, the older man in his late 50s, keeping in good shape with a strong build, muscular physique shown thanks to his rolled-up sleeves. Though his gut is rather large, and beard bushy.<br />
<br />
&quot;NATHAN! Late on your first day!&quot;<br />
<br />
Straight to the point, Nathan locks up and lowers his head. Following the ranting man into the main office blocks. Past the glass spaces, and to a back room. Henry&#39;s office, with accolades lining the walls, and a fine wooden desk towards the back. Out of sight of everyone else, as the two take a seat, and the manager continues to complain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had high hopes when I saw your CV. You&#39;re young, determined, and just the type we needed. But you couldn&#39;t even get here on time! You know how many candidates we have, Nathan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hundreds, and I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t all be late!&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry takes a sip of his coffee, putting it back down, and standing up to look out the window. Seeing the city ahead, and Nathan thinking to the vials Veronica gave him. He has no clue what they would do, but they really would get him out of this bind, wouldn&#39;t they? He just needs a drop to be drunk, and that coffees a good target.</p>
