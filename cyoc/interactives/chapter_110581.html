<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shelly suddenly felt dizzy as the weight of everything was suddenly lifted from her shoulders. She had to sit down, which she did, very suddenly, startling her family. She looked at their faces.<br />
<br />
“You OK?” asked Carrie.<br />
<br />
They looked more like her sisters or her BFFs than her parents and her ex-boyfriend now girlfriend. Somehow, she thought she could make it work with Carrie. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, this is just a lot to take in.”<br />
<br />
Shelly knew that she was bi-curious even before the Great Change, but didn&#39;t realize that everyone was now full on lesbian. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is Myspace still a thing?&quot; Shelly asked innocently, being cut off from all news for an entire decade. Carrie gave a quiet chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of. It still exists, but literally nobody uses it. It hasn&#39;t been relevant in years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Facebook?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s lame now because everyone uses it, and they invade your privacy out the wazoo. People nowadays mostly use Twitter, Instagram, or Snapchat, but there&#39;s a lot of others too.&quot; Carrie saw her girlfriend look confused and giggled again. She sat down next to her. &quot;It&#39;s OK if you don&#39;t know what those are, you&#39;ll get used to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did Harry Potter end?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry ended up being the last horcrux. He sacrifices himself, goes to the afterlife and meets Dumbledore. Then Voldemort accidentally kills himself. Ron and Hermione get married in the future, as do Harry and Ginny. There&#39;s a new book out called the Cursed Child that&#39;s about their kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OMG!&quot; said Shelly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; laughed Carrie, enjoying this trip down memory lane.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Heroes, is that still on the air?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Every season except the first one sucked, so they canceled it. Sylar ended up becoming the new Mr. Spock in Star Trek, and was on the first couple seasons of American Horror Story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; asked Shelly dismissively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s awesome! It&#39;s a horror series, and in the second season, he&#39;s so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But maybe you shouldn&#39;t watch those&quot; said Carrie abruptly, thinking back to the second season where the actor played a vicious kidnapper and serial killer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, I just realized that you&#39;ve been gone for so long that you missed the Twilight Saga, The Dark Knight, all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, and...shit. Do you know that Trevor Mariner was gay, and he got married to Garrett Greenridge?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said Shelly incredulously, thinking back on the two masculine seniors at her school the year she went missing with a bemused smirk. &quot;How is that possible? Did they move to Canada or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Shelly, how much I have to teach you...&quot;<br />
<br />

Mandy was finally finished with her homework, which she had been forced to complete by her mistress Kira. “After all” said Kira, “My paddle is nothing compared to the torture that is learning chemistry”. Mandy respectfully disagreed. She&#39;d much rather be in Kira&#39;s sex dungeon/bedroom right now getting paddled to Hell and back, but Kira&#39;s word was god, and so Mandy was compelled to do what the mistress wanted. It wasn&#39;t so bad. Mandy was a pretty good student anyways. Her mother would be on her ass if she wasn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
Now that she had nothing obligatory left to do, Mandy started working on her next project, which was installing some cameras in her room. Earlier she had told Kira about this idea and how turned on she was by voyeurism, which in retrospect probably applied to why she had been a basketball player back when she was Manny, but I digress. The mistress had been weary about going down that road since she was worried about peeping tom laws, but Mandy wasn&#39;t planning on releasing this footage. It would have to wait until they were both over the age of consent, which wasn&#39;t too far away admittedly, Mandy would turn eighteen in a couple of months. In the meantime however, Mandy could get the exhibitionist thrill of at least PRETENDING that she was being watched by her dominating lover. She had an enormous grin as she wiggled her ass to the camera. <br />
<br />

<br />
Millie&#39;s confession had been a huge weight off of her shoulders. She had talked to people after her father had been in jail, but never to a friend like Juliana, let alone a lover or soon to be wife like her. <br />
<br />
Juliana wasn&#39;t sure how to respond. Her family was very large and close knit, and while maybe a few of them were a little rowdy, and her Uncle Esteban in particular was a debaucherous and dirty old man(In the lovable way), nobody had ever had the temerity or the cruelty to rape their own children. Standing by and letting it happen, too, was just as heinous. Juliana just couldn&#39;t imagine such a nightmare of a childhood, no wonder Milton had been so closed off during her tenure. She had so many questions to ask of Millie, but didn&#39;t want to be interrogative. She wanted to support Millie, and knew the truth would come out in due time.<br />
<br />
“Millie, honey, I&#39;ll do anything that you feel is the right thing to do. If you want to locate your parents right now, that&#39;s cool, but if you never want to see them again for the rest of our lives together, I&#39;d personally slam the door in their faces if they ever stopped by.”<br />
<br />
“T-thank you” said Millie, holding Juliana firmly.<br />
<br />
“So” said Juliana, trying to lighten the mood once again, “I guess we have a wedding to plan.”<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
“So how was your booty call?” asked Dani to her grandmother Julia, skating together in the park. Julia had to keep reminding herself that Dani and her, while technically the same age biologically now, were decades apart in actual age. Julia was known for being quite forward for a lady in her day, but Dani seemingly had no care in the world for boundaries like talking about casual sex with her elders. <br />
<br />
“She was delightful. Her name was Sabrina.”<br />
<br />
They both let go of one another for a second, each traversing to the other side of the asphalt path as some clueless girl lost in a book blocked their skating excursion. When they passed her, Dani and Julia rejoined their familial embrace hand in hand.<br />
<br />
“Think you might want to give it a second go?” asked Dani again. <br />
<br />
“I just might. What about you. Do you have a special someone at school?”<br />
<br />
Before the Great Change, Dani had suitors lining up to date her, or more accurately, try to score with her all around the block. As a short, very busty Asian chick, she had of course attracted all types of boys interested in her, and like the tease that she was, Dani spurned them all. Now that they had all transformed into young ladies as cute and busty as she was, well, she could see now much of a prick she must have been like to be so close yet so far on purpose. Dani was beside herself in the sea of femininity and beauty, wanting to try every single one of them out, but now that she was just another face in the crowd and the market far more competitive and hyper-sexualized, those suitors had dwindled to nothing.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ve been looking” she said.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Maria Sevilla spent that evening fuming over the Presidential debate going on, which partisan politics aside, was another wanton display of lesbian pride and disregard for the Bible. The two candidates, both of whom were in their late sixties or early seventies, were both currently bombshell objects of sexual lust, more appropriate to be judged at a pornography convention or a beauty pageant than to be the leader of this great country. Maria had been especially angry at the born woman who had been running for president for not transforming back into her older state like Maria had wanted her to. Maria thought it would have shown integrity on her part, to sacrifice a chance at youth in order to show that she was willing to do anything for the public, but most people were not Maria, and they had embraced the new appearances of the candidates. They, too, of course were more concerned that one of candidates was competent and sane and the other one was incompetent and insane. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which, one unfortunate side effect of the Great Change was that it was now much more difficult to pin accusations of sexism or misogyny on someone now that everyone was of the same female gender. The new woman candidate had been accused of blatant misogyny for her many comments all throughout the two year long campaign cycle. After the Great Change had commenced, many of her supporters argued that it all could now quietly be swept under the rug, with the new woman candidate claiming “Well, I&#39;m a woman now, and now I know what it&#39;s like to be judged unfairly...blah blah blah”, despite not having actually learned a thing. In fact, all this person had done with her new gift of womanhood was orgasm in front of the mirror twice every morning. Blonde cutie or not, she was still the same chauvinist pig deep down inside. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
<br />
Regina and Aziza and James watched as reality melt away in front of them. <br />
<br />
“What&#39;s going on now?” asked Regina.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know” said Aziza. She turned to James, who shrugged. “I can only guess that the games have finally begun.”<br />
<br />
The three sorcerers, as well as the multiverse machine, were transported to what appeared to be a dying, decaying planet.</p>
