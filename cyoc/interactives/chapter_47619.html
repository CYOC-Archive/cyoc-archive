<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>It had been nearly two hours gone by in the victorian home when Erick's brother John knocked on his door.  At the first attempt, he thought nothing not getting a response.  If Jeff were upstairs experiencing a hangover and had locked the door, of course he would get no answer.  However, John returned to the downstairs just long enough to see that Erick's car was still in the driveway.  Confused, he returned upstairs to the bedroom door.</p>

<p>This time was a different story, however.  As John began to knock on the door, he heard some kind of knocking and moaning sound.  His eyes narrowed a bit as he considered someone might be pounding one out, but then realized the sound of two bodies moving together.  John had left explicit instructions that neither Erick nor Jeff were to have unwelcomed female friends over due to damage caused by the last ones.</p>

<p><i>What if it is Erick </i>and<i> Jeff,</i> John wondered as he started to bang on the door.  He was a large man who would have worked out all the time if he didn't work construction almost constantly.  It was good work, and he'd made enough money to buy this house in the first place.  Still, if there was one thing he <i>didn't</i> need within earshot of his three-year-old it was <i>sex</i>… especially if it happened to be two <i>men</i> having sex.</p>

<p>There seemed no break in the sound as John smashed his fist against the door, and when he still did not get a reply and had hear the groans and slaps go on for nearly twenty minutes, he turned and headed a ways up the hall.  Taking a few long steps back towards the door, John leaned forward like he was taking on the defensive line, and slammed his shoulder hard into the door leading into Erick and Jeff's shared room.</p>

<p>The door slapped inward, wood flying from the doorframe as the lock broke free.  Instead of finding two humans having sex, he found two dogs, both male.  Not only that, but it took a moment to realize that they were identical as was the third dog that seemed to be cleaning itself off with its tongue.  They were all Bruno, the animal that he'd told his brother to keep inside so as not to seed the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The three animals continued what they were doing, oblivious to John as he shook off his dumbfounded look at the situation and glanced up at Erick's computer screen.  It hadn't gone to screensaver which meant it had been active doing something, and it was that thought that took John passed the dogs and over to the computer.  He sat down, tilting his head a bit to the side as he tied to understand what it was he was looking at.</p>

<p>"Four Subjects… Name: John Gruber, Age: 28, Height: 6'3", Weight: 239 lbs., Gender: Male, Sexual Preference: Hetero, Hair Color: Blonde, Eye Color: Blue, Body Fat: 9%, IQ: 120…" he said to himself.  "Yeah, that's me," he thought as he glanced at the other three subjects on the page that all had the same exact statics.  The same, except, that their names were listed as Bruno, Erick Gruber, and Jeffery Wilson.  "No way," he said to himself, looking back at the dogs.</p>

<p>Not believing the situation, but thinking it too strange to pass up, he selected 'All But User' for the changes he was about to type in, assuring that every one of the subjects in the Chronivac's range would change and not himself.  If Erick and Jeff had turned themselves by mistake, which he hoped, then he didn't want the same to happen to him.  As it was, he didn't know which dog was which.</p>

<p>John changed the dog's sex to hetero, just for starters.  He hated gays.  Secondly, he looked under advanced options and chose the open for 'Human Language' then checked the history tab for previous changes.  It looked like the highest IQ of the bunch was Jeff's 105, so he made that the new IQ for the preset.  Sure, it would make Bruno smart, but it was the only way he was going to get a straight answer out of them without making them all dog-smart humans.</p>

<p>Before hitting 'Save Changes', John looked over all the options just to be safe: "Species: Canis Lupus, Breed: Irish Setter," he said, looking over to what he'd always thought was an ugly dog.  He hated just about everything about Erick and what he did, but this dog was now just an extension of that.  However, John's son John (Junior) seemed to have enjoyed the time playing in the park with a friend's Husky, so John smirked and changed the breed.</p>

<p>"Breed: Husky," John continued to read aloud, "Sexual Preference: Hetero, Age: 4 (Dog Years), Status: Not Fixed, Colors: Blackish Blue and White, Body Size: Average, Speech: Human, English, IQ: Human 105" he looked up closer to the top of the screen to see that 'All But User' was still selected.  He slid the mouse pointer over to the 'Save Changes' button, but hesitated.  Instead he clicked 'Save as Default' since it was better than the old 'gay dog' default.  Satisfied with his changes, he clicked on 'Save Changes'.</p>

<p>As John watched the a blue loading bar appear at the bottom of the screen, he saw that a new listing had slid up under the three other dogs of Bruno, Erick, and Jeff.  There was a fifth name on the screen, and it's details appeared as if they would also be affected by the change that was still loading.</p></p>
