<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jared had witnessed his father being greedy. Friend Carl was as well greedy for wanting to experience the lifestyle of a farm or herd sire kept busy breeding. He had propositioned Mr. Morrison, and knew too much about the powers of the Medallion, and of Jared being lucky to live as a stallion during any weekday, or when leased to breed, mate a mare.<br />
<br />
Horny lusts brought Carl to agree, and became then as a brute Devon breed bull. As after a six hour nap, when Carl awoke, he became immeadiatly excited, as genitals aroused, and began to bellow as moo, feeling the raw urge to be in rut.<br />
<br />
Happily, Carl boarded the livestock trailer and made not a sound as Mr. Morrison drove his new bull to where during four weeks of sexual frolicking, the youth named Carl would willingly cease to exist. The devilish bull named Satan would take full control of his bull body and the mentality of Carl would fade into a beastly sexual oblivion.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Morrison knew of what her husband did by the powers in the Medallion. She and her son Jared when changed back to being his human self, did argue about Carl, as if he remained a bull past fourteen days, the transformation would be then as a permanent situation.<br />
<br />
Mr. Morrison was more than willing to doom-damn Carl to being permanently as a bull, he was a danger that through the Medallion, Carl became an asset to the profitability of the family farm.<br />
<br />
Jared talked with his mother and they deised a scheme to give Carl a better chance to return to him being his human self, and let his experiences of bull lifestyle become a fond memory.<br />
<br />
The eleventh day since Carl became a Red Devon breed bull, and Jared with the Medallion in his shirt pocket went to the Bensen Farm, he wanting to see there Satan the bull.<br />
<br />
Mr. Bensen knew Jared and told him to be careful as to approaching a herd bull while during mating time. As Jared told a story of him and Satan as a 4-H project, and the bull was when around Jared, acted like a 1500 pound puppy.<br />
<br />
Jared went then to the pasture gate and yelled, calling of Satan to come. He felt sacred that from his calling aloud the name of Satan, the Medallion could direct the real Demon Satan to meet with Jared.<br />
<br />
One happy as bounding horny big red curlly furred bull pushed past the cows milling around him, as he took to a galloping run toward where jared stood outside the pasture fence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Medallion Spirit, I wish to speak with my friend Carl, he being what you changed of body to being a Devon breed bull!&quot; Jared said as boldly, and he having the Medallion in hand, it obeyed its present Master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carl, Carl, friend can you understand my words?&quot; Jared said, as Satan the bull came within ten feet from the fence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moo, ah, ah..., ah-huh, Ca... Carl, yes that is me; hello Jared!&quot; Carl&#39;s mentality awoke slowly from deep within the dark beast-mind confines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Carl so good to talk with you, are you having fun being a bull?&quot; Jared asked, as did not know what to expect Carlmight say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, well yes, but it did take some getting to appreciate, no not that, as like not that either, my being a bull took some erotic turns I never expected.&quot; Carl said, as much still baffled by his living as a herd sire bull for just eleven days and ten nights.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time is the issue, as my dad planned for you to reside here being this bull animal as your bodily self for for weeks; is that what he told you?&quot; Jared asked of Carl as the bull began to walk in slow circles, he trying to think, recall, and decide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Carl replied, &quot;Your Dad got a phone call and then offered me to live a fun fantasy, me being as a bull. As much I would wish he came with you here, because I do like being a bull!<br />
<br />
Like I said, being a bull is rather an erotic lifestyle. Mating with cows, well they are dirty, vile, sour smelling, and whimsical about being bred. Learning how to graze was a challange, as is the anger and jealosy the cows have for each other and me.<br />
<br />
Mounting a cow is awkward, and to my surprise my cock does its own style to spurt-thrusting, and no pelvic action like you do when as a horse. My hopes are...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Carl, Carl listen to me and try to understand why I came here to visit with you. My dad feels that your knowledge of me becoming as a stallion is a danger to our family and farm. He coaxed you to want for becoming as a bull, and told your it would be for four weeks. Four weeks surpasses the deadline of fourteen days, as if you remain a bull another three days beyond today, the bull body will be as your body, and like permanently!&quot; Jared announced, he said as with the passion he felt to save a friend from making a terrible mistake.<br />
<br />
Carl flcked his ears and snorted, he then took to walking in circles as he began to think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three more days and if when I awake come the fifteenth morning I must stay a bull, me becomings as Satan..., hmmm..., being a bull ain&#39;t all bad, now that I know how to capture and hold a cow under me!<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t like the flies as they are a bother. I have no sense of personal hygiene, my mom would be disgusted with me about that, for sure!<br />
<br />
It is hard for me to decide, as Satan he likes being alive rather than as a dead animal devoid of his spirit. Satan is overbeing, he presses my mind back into a far corner of our small brain. I don&#39;t know what to say, as being a bull has its pros and cons, but to my thinking the pro of being a bull is my sexual freedom.<br />
<br />
Okay, thanks for coming, but I think I want to stay being a bull!&quot; Carl said and to the astonishment of Jared.<br />
<br />
Jared stepped back and away from the fence as he took hold of the Medallion. &quot;Medallion Spirit, hear now me, as my good friend Carl, he is now a Red Devon bull and has grown to liking his being an animal. As he is a friend, I want to gift him a life of long longevity, as he is the equal of a 2 year old bull, I ask he shall never show his age, feel always as young, being contantly virile, as healthy, alert, he being the driving mentality of his bull mind. Let him live as a bull for... is a hundred years as a herd sire enough for you Carl, okay then that was agreed, Carl shall live being a bull for at least the next hundred years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carl turned and running, he bounded back to his circle of heifers and cows, and ignored Jared standing outside the fence.</p>
