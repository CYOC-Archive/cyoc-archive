<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The itch in his face started about a week, week and a half after he&#39;d lost the capability to go about on two legs. Forced down on four legs, to move about truly like the dog he&#39;d become eventually, Jeff didn&#39;t give it much thought at first. When he did think about the annoyance he felt, how it was centred around his nose for the most part, but sometimes went down into his jaw, he considered that it was likely due to having to stick his whole face, which was still very much human, like the rest of his head, into the bowls of water and food he ate and drank from, or anything that he had to suddenly feel the urge to investigate.<br />
<br />
When it started to spread to the rest of his head, he grew a titbit concerned. Asking himself, &quot;Am I sick with something,&quot; as he rubbed at his face and head with his paws, much the same way a dog would, he wondered if maybe he had caught something due to not being canine from the neck up.<br />
<br />
It was only when the sensation went down into his body that he at first grew worried, then figured out what was happening. As his nipples grew more sensitive to stimuli, followed shortly by what he could only describe as a buzzy, tingly, electric feeling inside and around his vagina, that he was soon clued into what was happening. Understanding that he was again changing, that more of his former humanity was being stripped from him, Jeff grew scared. Not wanting it to happen, yet also not the least bit concerned that if it didn&#39;t happen he&#39;d be stuck looking like a bitch from the neck down, whilst his head was still that of a teenage boy, he tried to fight against it. When the need to hump his bedding, to lick his swollen, needful female sex, he hurried outside and sat in a snowbank, finding the cold against his vulva helped to lessen the need, though did nothing to relieve him.<br />
<br />
Days drifted by in torment, and Jeff wasn&#39;t sure which was worse; the itch in his face, or the near overpowering desire to masturbate. Sleeping less and less in the laundry room, he kept himself outside as long as he could, going inside only when the cold became too much, at which point he lay down on the kitchen floor until he was shooed out of the kitchen. Avoiding his dog basket in the laundry room, he found himself wandering through the house one day after his human mother coaxed him out of the kitchen so she could prepare dinner. Wanting to find a place to lay down, to maybe sleep, and a way to ignore the both ends of his body, Jeff found himself in the bathroom for the first time in some time. Peering at his reflection, he at first thought it looked the same, a shrunken human head of a teenage boy stuck to the body of a female dog, but then he uttered a soft whimper as he saw after a moment that he had changed yet again, despite how he&#39;d refused to give into any of the biological needs.<br />
<br />
Unsure of when it had happened, he was alarmed by what he saw. Turning his head one way, then another, Jeff found there was simply no way to deny what he saw. Having flattened at some point, his human nose was gone, whilst his nostrils had gained a slight width between themselves. And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, Jeff noted what had used to be the tip of his nose had gone from the pale pinkish-white hue of his normal skin tones to darkening to what he could tell would be a black dog’s nose, which already had a moist look to it. Whimpering at the sight before him, he uttered, &quot;It&#39;s not fair,&quot; before he could stop himself.<br />
<br />
The words coming out as a serious a barks, Jeff whimpered again and took a couple steps back away from the mirror. Staring at his reflection, upset that even though he hadn&#39;t given in to the needs and wants of his new biology, he&#39;d still changed, he was started when the door swung open and his human father&#39;s voice could be heard saying, &quot;Well what&#39;d you do? Did you get yourself stuck in the here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he was able to stop himself, Jeff started to bark playfully and bound about. His dad laughing and reaching down to pet him, Jeff listened as the man said, &quot;Come on, Nikki,&quot; as he scooped Jeff up.<br />
<br />
Carried through the house, Jeff found himself still overcome with the sense of hyperactivity. Desiring to play, he squirmed about, tried to lick the man&#39;s face, was told to hold still, and before he was able to fathom what was happening, he was placed outside with the words, &quot;Outside, Nikki. I&#39;ll play with you after dinner, okay,&quot; and with a finality, Jeff listened as the backdoor was shut behind him.<br />
<br />
His first instinct was to whimper, to cry, to howl. Resisting the urge, much as he resisted so much, Jeff paced back and forth, before, unsure what to do, he trotted down the cement steps. Taking to wandering the back yard, stopping to sniff at specific areas, to squat and mark spots, he wasn&#39;t aware he was doing so, but as he focused more and more on what he knew was to ultimate outcome, he gave himself more and more over to the bitch he was becoming until, as he came to a spot a rabbit had burrowed under the fence, Nikki took full control. Letting forth a series of woofs, she went to work with her front paws as she dug.<br />
<br />
This, it seemed, was the last thing Jeff recalled. He remembered the scent of the animal, the want to go after it, how he placed his front paws and started to use them, and then he drifted away, much in the same way he&#39;d done so when he lost his masculinity and ended up covered in fur. Some part of him knew he should fight against this, much as he knew, and wanted, to fight against the change that was chipping away at him. Yet, it was so hard, and when he was able to reassert control, it was to utter confusion.<br />
<br />
He had no idea how much time had passed, nor where exactly he was. Dimly staring at the snow covered land, the trees around him, his first thought was he was at the park. But then it was driven from him as he realised there was something heavy on top of him. Focusing his attention on it, he suddenly wished he hadn&#39;t, as with the knowledge of what was on him came the understanding of a thrusting sensation behind him. And with each rapid, hard push, he became aware of something hard poking at him. Startling, everything coming into focus, he wanted to get away from what he knew was about to happen, but his body betrayed him. Trying to step away, he instead positioned himself better for what was to happen, and attempting to tense up, he found he was unable to, as his body wanted what was to happen. And then it did.<br />
<br />
With sharp forward thrusts, Jeff felt the canine penis penetrate his vagina, and at first he tried to howl out that he didn&#39;t want this. But as the movement became more assured, he was alarmed that not only did he want this, but he was enjoying it. Thinking, &quot;Oh, shit. I&#39;m being mounted like a bitch, and I actually like it,&quot; the thoughts were driven from him as Jeff was witness to what has happening to his face.<br />
<br />
Pounded harder and harder, with each sharp jab, the inevitable change that he&#39;d struggled to keep at bay sped up as his face began to elongate. Lower jaw jutting more and more outward, the area that used to be his nose followed suit as the black, moist end grew more noticeable. Teeth falling out, replaced by those normal for a dog, Jeff could only stare in horror as his muzzle grew in, with the final changes he was witness to was the white fur that covered the lower portion and the front half of the top, brown fur coating the back half of the top, and whiskers. Whimpering, Jeff  lowered his head as he gingerly reached up and ran a paw down the muzzle that now dominated his face. Emitting another series of cries, not so much for what had happened, but at the sensations he was feeling at the other end as the other dog finished and became knotted in place, Jeff for the first time wished he could give himself completely over to the dog he was becoming and didn’t have to bear witness ever time he lost a bit of who he used to be.</p>
