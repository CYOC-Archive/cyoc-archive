<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dannie Smiled nervously as she was led into the boardroom under Mr. Simpson’s strong embrace in her bare arm. Dannie had made so many reports to these men and women of high stature over the years that her feelings at that point should have been nothing but ease and relaxation bordering on bliss. The difference this time around for Dannie was that she was not the executive with a high position and earned respect but a scantily-clad secretary brought in to serve drinks and act as eye candy to wandering male eyes. The difference was stunning to her and anyone closely studying her. Dannie’s nervous smile badly hid an extreme anxiety and shame as every eye in the room immediately fell upon her and then began working their way down to lower regions of her new body that Dannie had never really gott4n used to in the first place. Danny found herself beginning to use her free arm to cover her breasts and her hand to shield her open midriff but a quick arm jolt and angry stare by Mr. Simpson quickly ended that attempt at modesty. The buxom boardroom babe began to slowly breathe in through her nose and out her mouth to calm down and prevent herself from hyperventilating as all the males  in the room gazed lustfully at her body. Dannie didn’t want any of this “I’m heterosexual dammit, I like women…..wait that didn’t sound right” she thought as she mentally cringed at her predicament.<br />
<br />
Soon the male gaze lessened and the meeting began as the board members took their seats around the oval table and looked towards the CEO Joe Sullivan at the forward podium. Mr. Simpson took the rapidly breathing Dannie and placed her behind him standing up against the middle-sidewall as he took a seat. Joe gave a friendly smile to everyone including Dannie before the meeting began. Throughout the lectures of everyone up to Mr. Simpson Dannie wasn’t given even a second to give her own opinion on a project, everyone in the room was given a chance to critique another set of work but as soon as Dannie raised her hand either Joe or the lecturer passed over and ignored her or if Mr. Simpson observed her attempting insurrection a quick death stare by him immediately caused her hand to shoot back down. The humiliation was getting unbearable as during Mr. Simpson’s lecture he had Dannie come up to the podium with him and be the pointer for his power-point presentation. Armed with a thin stick Dannie had to reach and point, bend over, and stretch her body in all planned erotic ways to reach the graph points and numbers indicated by Mr. Simpson’s speech. Dannie was forced by survival and necessity to smile happily as smirks went up in every male face in the room but the widest of course came from Mr. Simpson her former best friend. Even before this erotic humiliation began Dannie nearly passed out and had to steady herself as the power-point presentation turned on and up on the screen in big letters was HER report in all of its glory but the horror reached home when she saw that the stated author was in fact Peter Simpson. All of the points, sentence structure, and references were all typed and researched by her and that she remembered but Mr Simpson was the author. “I wrote that report I Danielle Travers no wait I Dani, Dani, Danielle Travers, Dammit to hell!” Dannie mentally screamed as she gazed up at this self-imposed horror before her.<br />
<br />
Mr. Simpson finished his report and followed Dannie in front of him back to his seat where he sat back down. Just as Dannie turned back around to head back to the wall Pete couldn’t help it and gave her a hard slap on the ass causing her to yelp and jump in her high heels. Chuckles and laughter sprang out from everyone in the room as a heavily flustered and stunned Dannie looked back at him with daggers in her eyes as she pranced back to the wall and turned to face the room. The humiliation was at its peak when Dannie was asked to go to the kitchenette in the side-room and pour champagne and deposit snacks in bowls for every board member. The former executive couldn’t believe her change of fortunes at this point as she begrudgingly began carefully pouring champagne bottles into glasses in the kitchenette and sprinkling nuts into small china bowls before placing everything on a server tray to be brought out into the boardroom. Dannie died inside when she realized that she didn’t know how she was going to balance the tray in heels and serve everything flawlessly to everyone. Turns out her fears were misguided as she expertly scooped up the tray and swiftly strode out into the boardroom with a big smile on her face in a way that she didn’t know she could as she actually enjoyed the feeling. Coming out of the swinging door Dannie was concentrated on her task but did see for a split second Mr. Simpson pick the golden pen off a piece of paper and place it back in his inner coat pocket then give her a hard stare as she went about her duties. Dannie expertly served the drinks and snacks to all the members bending over reach time and unintentionally giving them all a birds eye view into her cleavage which she just had to deal with as when she realized what was going on the fact was that there was no other way to serve at the table without giving that opportunity out. Several members took the opportunity as she was bent over to grope her butt and take their time with it to the cheers and laughter of the other members. Dannie was deeply ashamed and saddened by this behavior but she had no choice for the position she was now in there was no room for confrontation. Dannie got no champagne or snacks of her own for Mr. Simpson forbid her from taking part in the ending celebrations, she was told to go back in the kitchenette and clean up the area. In the kitchenette Dannie placed her hands on her face and began to sob at what she had done to her life.</p>
