<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I saw everything, Kevin.&quot; Kristoff entered the room and closed the door. There&#39;s the annoying smirk he always did whenever he caught Mark and his siblings doing wrong. &quot;Or should I say, Mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I– I can explain,&quot; Mark stammered. Being caught like this turned him off instantly. Once he was feeling the comfort of Kevin&#39;s young body, suddenly the room&#39;s coldness seemed encompassing. His legs shivered, and he had to sit on Kevin&#39;s messy bed to support himself. &quot;There was this printer and—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew about the printer when I passed by your room. There was a batch of stickers on the paper tray that looked similar to what you stuck on Kevin&#39;s back. It didn&#39;t take me long to piece two-and-two together. You have these printers that can let you possess people.&quot; Kristoff peeled a sticker from his palm and swiftly stuck it on Mark&#39;s chest. Mark tried to dodge with his shorter legs but wasn&#39;t quick enough. He braced himself, expecting something to happen when the sticker touched him, but nothing happened. He opened his eyes and saw Kristoff already peeling the sticker off. &quot;It seems this would not let me occupy an occupied body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell, Kristoff?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I had an idea and tested it out. I&#39;ve only been gone for a few months, don&#39;t tell me you forgot how I operate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember how crazy you could be sometimes.&quot; Mark reached into Kevin&#39;s pile of used clothes and wore something baggy to cover himself from the cold. He couldn&#39;t be picky about which shirt to wear, even though they all smelled. He had been caught red-handed and was being watched closely. &quot;Are you going to tell the others about the printer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My nosy side of me tells me hell yes. I could only imagine how livid mom would be once she learned you possessed Kevin&#39;s body, and if I was assuming correctly, you were going to jack off with Kevin&#39;s cock. However— that doesn&#39;t seem like a fun decision so why the hell not. I won&#39;t tell you in exchange for giving me some of those stickers. You can jack off with Kevin&#39;s pubescent dick for all I care.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure you won&#39;t tattle to mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m an adult Kev– I mean, Mark. I wasn&#39;t the same kid that tattled on you when you took a shit on Aunt Gertrude&#39;s living room and blamed it on the dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she was a bitch but you don&#39;t have to remind me about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was. Anyway, just print me a couple of those stickers of yours and I&#39;ll keep you to yourself. I won&#39;t possess you in case you&#39;re worried about that. Well… unless you want me to.&quot; While they might look just about the same, Mark was a complete downgrade compared to Kevin. Lowering himself by possessing Mark&#39;s body seemed like a waste of a sticker. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh… no. I&#39;ll give a bunch of stickers but keep your hands off my body. I&#39;ll do the same to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a deal. I better return to my room and fix up my things, while you return to whatever you were doing with Kevin&#39;s body.&quot;<br />
<br />
With Mark alone in Kevin&#39;s room again, he couldn&#39;t return to jacking off with Kevin&#39;s cock. He was still too freaked out after being caught, and dinner was drawing near. He spent the rest of the hour printing and preparing Kristoff&#39;s stickers. He made plenty of 1-hour stickers, then he made ones that can last 12 hours and up to a week. There were enough stickers to possess an entire town of bodies once he finished. <br />
<br />
As the duration of the sticker on Kevin&#39;s body neared its end, Mark returned to Kevin&#39;s bed and left his body there. Leaving was as swift as entering. He woke up beside the bed and found Kevin stirring from his sleep. He tapped him on his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up, twerp. Mom said to dress nicely and come downstairs. Dinner is ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- I was just pla-&quot; Kevin looked around and stared at his inactive computer. He glanced at the clock, his face twisting in confusion. &quot;Did I just fall asleep?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were already asleep when I came in, so yeah. Well, hurry up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dinner with Uncle Finn and Cousin Richie went as it usually would. He spent half of it complaining about politics while gorging himself with potatoes and gravy. The rest were him complaining about his divorce, his booming gym business, and roping Mark&#39;s dad into his ginger ale side hustle. Cousin Richie ate quietly in the corner before slinking back into the living room to play with his portable console. Mark&#39;s mom egged Mark and Kevin to hang out with their cousin, but the two stealthily climbed upstairs to do their thing. Mark knows Richie prefers his own company, and he has better things to do. When he entered his room, Mark already found Kristoff admiring his batch of stickers.<br />
<br />
&quot;You made plenty for me, thanks.&quot; Kristoff said as he stuffed his bag with the stickers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you using those stickers, anyway? You have everything a person ever wanted. You&#39;re handsome, smart, charismatic. If anything, people should be possessing you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never thought you saw me that way. I&#39;m proud of you for admitting that. But that last statement was a rhetorical statement, right?&quot; Kristoff grinned mischievously. <br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t possess you because I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll retaliate back, but I didn&#39;t lie. You&#39;re gifted in everything, and it seems like you&#39;re lowering yourself by possessing somebody else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me start by reassuring you that I won&#39;t possess you unless you ask me to. If you&#39;re interested in possessing me, I&#39;m open to negotiation.&quot; Kristoff said. &quot;I think you overestimate my achievements. I&#39;ve had my fair share of negative experiences — It&#39;s just, I don&#39;t complain about them too much. And lastly, I&#39;ll possess people to have fun, not to compete in some tournament of qualities you cooked up in your head. I want to know what it&#39;s like to be someone else – older, younger, a different gender or sexuality. They said it&#39;s airy to the crotch when you have a pussy or a smaller dick. I am curious about these things, and you know I go to great lengths to sate my curiosity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was quiet for a moment. In truth, he always felt inferior to his older brother, and seeing his ideas of becoming someone else felt absurd. It felt like he took his achievements for granted. To hear his explanation was a wake-up call. He wasn&#39;t lowering himself, he was trying to experience more than himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; Mark sighed. &quot;You&#39;re right. I feel so dumb now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were pretty dumb, but that&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So… whose pussy are you masturbating with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Depends on which ex I meet first after I eat out in town tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
They spent the rest of the night talking about Kristoff&#39;s list of old flames in town. He initiated most of them, which was an easy task given his charisma and handsome appearance. But most were just quick relationships, the shortest one lasting no more than a week. He listed which ones gave him the best fuck, and theorized they might give him the most satisfying masturbation when possessed their bodies. He also had a lengthy bi-curious phase and admitted most of the baseball team had either sucked or got fucked by his cock. He lost touch with that side of him once he got into college, but he&#39;s curious if he&#39;ll get back to it if he possessed a gay guy&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
Mark was surprised to see this side of his brother and listened intently. He wanted to know more but their mom called them to sleep since it was already in the middle of the night. Kristoff was an adult, and Mark just became one but they were still being treated as if they were kids. Nonetheless, she was right. Kristoff never had a moment of rest ever since he came to town and he needed plenty to possess several bitches tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Mark left Kristoff&#39;s room and returned to his own. He still had plenty of one-hour stickers. He could finally finish what he started when he and Kristoff had resolved their issues. He entered Kevin&#39;s messy bedroom and discovered the slob sleeping half-naked on his bed as usual. After peeling a sticker, he stuck one on Kevin&#39;s shoulders and found himself waking up in his little brother&#39;s body. His eyes felt heavy from being woken up mid-sleep, but that didn&#39;t deter him from what he was about to do.<br />
<br />
Mark hooked his fingers on the bands of Kevin&#39;s shorts and underwear and pulled them off his legs. Lit only by the faint shine of the moon, he saw the glistening outline of Kevin&#39;s uncircumcised cock. It wasn&#39;t as big as his original, but it was smoother and cuter. He wrapped his hands around the shaft and slowly jerked himself off. <br />
<br />
The coldness of the room skittered away as the warmth from his body encompassed every inch of his flesh. He used both hands to jerk off his dick but retreated his non-dominant hand to bring the smell of Kevin&#39;s member to his nose. It smelled damp and rank, and the aroma clung tightly to his uncut fingernails. It seemed Kevin didn&#39;t take a shower as their mom ordered, and he had to thank him for that.<br />
<br />
&quot;For one, I was glad you&#39;re stubborn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hazy breaths and hushed moans filled the room. He was drawing close to release, and he saw how cutely his cock throbbed. Just before the moment of release, he grabbed a used shirt and wrapped it around his cock. He flipped over and bucked his hips as if he were fucking the fabric. And soon, he was ejaculating into it. He made shot after shot, moan after moan. It was more intense than he expected and shook him down to his core. <br />
<br />
As the last semen dribbled out of his cock, Mark pulled the sticker and woke up back as himself. Before Kevin wakes up, he quietly sneaks back into his room with the experience of jacking off as his younger brother. This was just the start. As long as the printer had ink, he could have fun for as long as he wanted. </p>
