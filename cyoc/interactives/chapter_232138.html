<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The lock was installed so Zoe could rest easy knowing no one could get in without a proper unlocking spell or a key if she didn&#39;t want them to get in, but she had convinced Loveheart to let the lock on the other side of the door stay. She felt like if it was removed it&#39;d destroy this room in a sense. It was an escape room after all. Now all that was left was... private lessons. <br />
Loveheart&#39;s illusions let her keep a tight schedule. If she knew where you were a modified spell and a skill or two let her just put her nearly anywhere in the school... least anywhere any normal wizard could get to. Such as inside of Zoe&#39;s room. Loveheart was smiling as she heard Zoe say she got the [Apprentice] sub-class and even gained a skill from it. After all Loveheart could show and describe an only slightly complicated spell like [Numbness] in her spellbook, describe it a bit, and then Zoe could puzzle out the rest allowing her to cast numbness on herself and realize she couldn&#39;t feel anything... It was... weird and made her feel like she was piloting a body instead of moving herself. Still that let her cast [change species] somewhat easily into the succubus form that Loveheart wanted to teach Zoe all about... or at least use to let Zoe understand other concepts easier. Pointing out how her body mana flows, how to concentrate and slowly increase the mana channels to increase her ability to cast spells, all sorts of types of mana that could potentially be used... mostly horny mana which was a thing that existed for some reason. And that now she was actually locked in her room. Turns out it&#39;s pretty easy to tell someone to just lock a random door in a hallways barely anyone passes through. <br />
<br />
That was the deal... Someone would come with two meals a day... and she&#39;d have to figure out how to unlock her door herself, or she&#39;d be late to the freshman trial and get booted from the island. It also meant she couldn&#39;t sneak out to see Solrss, and that felt the hardest part to her. She&#39;d have her classes with Loveheart and occasionally some [Tutor]... Eat some food that felt more like rations... and feel her [Lover] class clash against her heart as if it were breaking from being trapped away from Solrss. It was a new class, low leveled, not worth much, but she wanted it... She&#39;d speedrun this escape room. It&#39;s not like she couldn&#39;t do the other puzzles, but she had to find a way out. She leveled alright thanks to the [Tutors] and Loveheart&#39;s general magic lessons, but the thing that pushed her was Loveheart&#39;s Special lessons~ A few little spells and innate magical tricks most Succubi could intuit, and thanks to that multiplier she leveled considerably... and she noticed something about her [class] the [P.P. Enchanter] was now just the [P.P. Enchanter] again once it crossed that threshold and despite there not being a skill attached... her aptitude was growing. It was easier for her to see the way the puzzles went, to see how you may make a puzzle, to inscribe spells that may activate within an object, how best to enchant a dildo with [flesh mimicry] and [hea-... Zoe had a feeling she was leveling crazy fast thanks to that horny multiplier and loveheart&#39;s instruction but... It felt wrong to what Zoe originally was. <br />
<br />
It took 2 weeks for Zoe to find the unlocking mechanism to her door, and then she had finished her task. She turned back into plain human Zoe, and walked to the cafeteria where the [puzzlers] would be puzzling over something... Solrss wasn&#39;t with them, but Zoe had a lead. With the questioning of a few Draco [Wizards] she ended up at the [wizard] dueling arenas which weren&#39;t all [Wizards] casting fire stuff since there was a lot of magics that you could &quot;duel&quot; with... But Solrss was dueling the traditional way... and he seemed to have been doing it for awhile. His posture was slouched and poor, his robes were singed, torn, and slightly frozen in places, and he seemed at his limit for the day. This arena was mostly a thin rectangle. Solrss&#39;s opponent was some... humanoid ball of hair that was poofing out as if... electrified... They aimed a wand and a bolt of energy surged towards Solrss who just leaned to the side and fell of the stage. Some chuckles went out, and Zoe felt a little angry as she went to Solrss. The Draco was worse for wear, some of his scales were missing revealing some discolored flesh, and he seemed wearing and sad about letting Zoe see him in such a state. <br />
The poofed out fluffball asked &quot;Anyone else want to try to challenge me?&quot; Zoe raised her hand letting her [hide emotions] cover her anger. After helping Solrss to the bleachers the fluffball asked &quot;You know the basic rules you [puzzler]?&quot;<br />
Zoe said &quot;If you go out of bounds you lose, if you forfeit you lose, if you die you lose but try not to kill each other. That about right?&quot;<br />
&quot;More or less. I&#39;m feeling sporty. Feel free to cast the first spell.&quot;<br />
Solrss on the bench wondered what Zoe would do... What kind of path she was on. She seemed different, and a few weeks under Loveheart with aid from Avram? Most of her spells would be illusion though right?<br />
&quot;[Conditional Force cage: Puzzle: The Lock]&quot; Zoe muttered wand raised and a force cage bound by the arena appeared around the Fluffball with an obvious door with an obvious puzzle lock on it. Zoe had designed the puzzle, and wondered how long someone would take to solve it. The Fluffball tried blasting the walls itself with lightning, and while Zoe imagined the [Force cage] wasn&#39;t strong enough to withstand anything... this Fluffball would have better chance with the lock... probably. In the meantime Zoe levitated a book out of her self-made Bag of Holding and then looked to a special silver bracelet on her right wrist. With her wand she started scribing something on the bracelet she had found in the puzzle room while hearing the Fluffball cursing [Puzzlers]. A few minutes later Zoe was done inscribing something on her bracelet and then put her book back in the bag of holding. She could sense the Fluffball was almost done with her puzzle, and she dismissed the [Force cage] <br />
&quot;DAMMIT! I ALMOST HAD IT YOU!&quot; The Fluffball cursed as he saw Zoe shove her right hand at him as a stream of fire went towards him... and his fur which was particularly flammable at the moment as he dove off the stage. There were murmurings in the crowd. It wasn&#39;t a great spectacle, you couldn&#39;t follow along with the puzzle or really make out what Zoe had been inscribing... but you could tactically make some inferences and the more strategic members of the crowd nodded at the tactic with the caveat that it wouldn&#39;t work in a real fight most of the time. <br />
Solrss sighed as he muttered &quot;you are a [puzzler] at heart aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
Zoe said to the crowd &quot;Anyone who wants a duel... I guess Fluffball over there can take it.&quot; Zoe then imagined her [Emotional Empathy] really only worked on Solrss, she also imagined that she wasn&#39;t dense enough to sense that Fluffball really hated her guts, and that she didn&#39;t care what Fluffball felt if that really was his real name. Some mages wanted a talk, but not enough to interrupt her and Solrss leaving to have a more private discussion. <br />
<br />
In Solrss&#39; dorm room the two sat together happy and talking with each other as they shared a meal taken from the cafeteria. The [Lovers] class had been an inspiration of sort to Solrss. He had been stagnating in his 2nd year of studying magic, and felt that... If he couldn&#39;t be a great enchanter like Zoe he could at least have enough combat magic to protect them both. So he took a combat course and started dueling as much as he could to get some combat instinct going. The day was getting late, Zoe probably should&#39;ve headed back to her room. They slept in the same bed, and Zoe could&#39;ve used any number of spells or features... The two merely fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms. <br />
<br />
[Lover] Level up: 7<br />
Skill obtained: [Just how you like it] <br />
<br />
and Zoe felt like that level up was sweeter than all the others that she was remembering now for the sake of the readers<br />
