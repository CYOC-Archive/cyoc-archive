<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The room that the ceremony was to take place was very well decorated. Flowers of various kinds, though many of them plastic, judging by the lack of a floral scent hung on many parts of the walls. Many of the flowers were specifically Digitalis, or as many refereed to the plant, Foxgloves. There were rows of folding chairs set in straight lines along the central area of a very well polished wood floor. The shine was brilliant, and William thought he could see the reflection of himself and Martha in the wood, as it was that well polished. There were three rows of chairs set up at the moment, though the formation of all the chairs was different. In the front there were only four, and William could easily see Jenny and Harry sitting together. Directly behind them was a much longer row where a couple of normals, who smelled similar to Harry, but not quite, were presently leaning over to talk with Jenny and Harry. Given that the talk sounded friendly,  William assumed that they were Harry&#39;s parents. The last row had a few occupants in them, all with the scent of werefoxes, and likely were those who had come to see the event. All were dressed in the finest clothes they had.<br />
<br />
At the front was a row of folding chairs that were arranged in a sort of half circle where a few other werefoxes, all in their human forms, were seated. The central seat was not occupied, though Akane Tachibana was slowly making her way in that direction as the Anderson family made their way toward their appointed seats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Mr. Anderson,&quot; Jenny said to him politely as he and Martha approached, &quot;ready for the big night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for the formal welcome,&quot; William replied, &quot;I trust things are well and the two of you have your wedding plans down to a tee, complete with smiles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is still in the works, but we have the basic ideas down,&quot; Jenny smiled, &quot;Even with the odd things from my parents... we have plans to make sure they can&#39;t ruin everything if things do go south. Harry and I have some planning to do over the weekend... among some other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded as Martha moved to shake Jenny&#39;s hand. As they did so, William began to introduce his family.<br />
<br />
&quot;My wife, Martha, werecat, and a honorary member... the love of my life, even when I was too blind to see it,&quot; William spoke.<br />
<br />
Jenny and Harry didn&#39;t fully understand the end of that line but they did recognize he werecat they&#39;d met at Awareness while buying clothing for Jenny to wear that would fit her. They shook her hand with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;William told me about what he&#39;s offered you,&quot; Martha said to Jenny, &quot;if you ever need anything... anything... don&#39;t hesitate to ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry raised an eyebrow, as Jenny nodded. He didn&#39;t know about William&#39;s offer that if the Harpers completely rejected Jenny, that he and Martha would step in as surrogate parents should Jenny want or need the help. William meanwhile continued to introduce his family to Jenny and Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;My oldest son, Nate, werewolf and probably a were&#39;s biggest fan, before or after,&quot; William spoke, allowing Nate to give a polite wave and then ushered Eric to come forward, &quot;and my youngest son, Eric, weremer... probably the smartest guy I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a pleasure to meet you,&quot; Jenny answered and looked curiously to the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex Ramsey, ma&#39;am,&quot; Alex said politely, &quot;werewolf and Nate&#39;s boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you happiness,&quot; Jenny said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie Stovall, weremer,&quot; Julie introduced herself, &quot;I&#39;m Eric&#39;s girlfriend. This is my mom, Melissa... my dad couldn&#39;t be here, as he&#39;s busy with a family mater.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trouble?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only that his mother doesn&#39;t like having to pretend she&#39;s healing at the rate a normal human would age at,&quot; Melissa gave a chuckle, &quot;It&#39;s nothing, really.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Anderson&#39;s guests moved to take their seats while William and Martha kept a warm smile fixed on Eric and Julie. They might prefer that Eric had been able to wait, but so long as he was loved and happy that didn&#39;t matter. Both privately made the mental note to officially welcome Julie to the family at some point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such a large gathering for a formal welcome,&quot; Jenny gave a friendly smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is actually on the small side for most Skulk events,&quot; Harry said softly, &quot;Trust me on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
While his older brother had become the were in the Jenkins family when they moved to Moon Lake, that didn&#39;t mean that Harry hadn&#39;t picked up a few things, especially from those he worked with or met before going to college. One of the members of the fire department was a werefox who had taken a liking to Harry as a kid when he showed up for their parades on the Fourth of July, various tours of the fire hall, and so on. From him, Harry had learned a fair bit about how big certain ceremonies for the Skulk could be.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid we don&#39;t have as many people to introduce,&quot; Harry gave a soft shrug, &quot;My older brother had an emergency come up with his work and was too tired to come, and thus I haven&#39;t gotten the chance to let him meet Jenny, yet... but my parents are here.  This is my mom, Lisa, and my father, Henry, both are normals, but have done well and raised me to be respectful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Henry Jenkins spoke, &quot;Hopefully this will put all the things revolving around the rogue&#39;s actions to rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amen,&quot; William and Martha agreed.<br />
<br />
With that they all sat down as Akane moved to sit down in the central chair. William carefully looked around to see that the doors that they had come through into the room were now closed and that two of Akane&#39;s grandsons stood sentry at the doors, which made sense. William hadn&#39;t heard much about Jenny&#39;s parents beyond what she had told him directly, but from what she had said, they didn&#39;t quite sound like the sort of people who would be rather understanding. That made entirely possible that they could cause trouble when they arrived in Moon Lake. He then turned forward again to wait and see how the ceremony would go.<br />
<br />
After a few moments as Martha, William, Jenny, and Harry looked forward to Akane as she then stood up from her seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Konbanwa (Good evening), members of the Moon Lake Skulk, Den Leaders, and honored guests of the Skulk and our new members,&quot; Akane spoke clearly and firmly, but yet lovingly as well. It was a strange combination that created the sensation that there was a great deal of personal care for everyone there, even if the Skulk leader didn&#39;t know everyone personally.<br />
<br />
Harry politely took Jenny&#39;s hand and gave it a soft loving squeeze. Martha and William both looked forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;All of us in Moon Lake are always eager to see normals join were society to see that we are not the monsters we are depicted as, at least not by nature,&quot; Akane continued, &quot;But we always operate by tradition and by our own laws, be they Skulk... Moon Lake... or any other were community. We do not bite, scratch, or rape anyone and the normal must always enter were society in a way in which they feel welcomed.&quot;<br />
<br />
An air of silence filled the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;And when a were breaks these rules, there is great shame that comes down on us all, because the rogue has behaved exactly as we try not to be and the new were is often scared and afraid of themselves,&quot; Akane continued, &quot;and when the rogue is a member of our own community that is even worse... and it now falls to us to welcome our new brothers and sisters and assure them that we are not all like the rogue that so wrongfully clawed them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane turned her head to where Martha, William, Jenny, and Harry were seated.<br />
<br />
&quot;To William Anderson and Jennifer Harper,&quot; Akane spoke to them, while raising her hands, which urged them to stand.<br />
<br />
Harry let go of Jenny&#39;s hand as his fiance and their English professor slowly stood up in response to the movement. Harry returned his looking to Akane as the Skulk leader continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have our sincerest apologies for the actions of Yvette Smith and we assure you that not of all of were society and certainly not all of the Skulk is like her,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;and we&#39;d want you both to know that you are both welcome to join the Moon Lake Skulk, should you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha sat by quietly. Some of this was a repeat of the things that had been said her by various weres that they had met, including the at the in service. When they learned that they learned that she was William Anderson&#39;s wife, every one apologized for Yvette&#39;s actions. William had gotten many of the same sort of apologies, particularly from other werefoxes that he had met at the college. He bowed politely to Akane and spoke in answer to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have met other Skulk members at the college,&quot; William spoke, &quot;they have been most welcoming and friendly. And being a werefox has provided benefits on many levels that I appreciate greatly. I would be honored to join the Moon Lake Skulk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been most kind and helpful to me, Mrs. Tachibana,&quot; Jenny bowed, &quot;I may not have been born in Moon Lake or asked to be a werefox, but you&#39;ve all proven Yvette Smith wrong. I would be honored to join the Moon Lake Skulk.&quot;<br />
<br />
They completed their bows and remained standing. Akane gave a very warm smile and then nodded. She then continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;That brings us great pleasure and great happiness,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;Happiness we&#39;d wish to share with all that touch our lives closely. For as foxes, our loves are an extension of ourselves. Bonded eternally and so strong that nothing may break it. Nothing may break that bond. Not new friends, not old mistakes...&quot; Akane paused and shed a lone tear for her own departed lover, &quot;Not even the loss of the partner may ever break that bond. It is what binds us as werefoxes together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha noticed Akane make raising gestures with her hands again and she stood up beside her husband. Harry also stood up beside Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harold Jenkins, your willing to give your all and do anything to aid your fellow werefox and joining werefox society in the process demonstrates great love and the formation of a firm bond that we have long noticed in all, regardless of their were species or if they are normals,&quot; Akane spoke to him, &quot;We would be honored to have your love for Jenny as a part of the Skulk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My family came here when I was very young... to young to join any were society and my older brother agreed to the Jenkins family were,&quot; Harry spoke with a bow, &quot;yet, Moon Lake has always been welcoming and friendly, and my love for Jennifer Harper was firm even before she became a vixen. I would do anything for her, and from what I&#39;ve personally experienced with werefoxes before recent events... I&#39;ve found nothing to negatively judge the Skulk. I would be honored to join the Moon Lake Skulk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane nodded and turned to Martha to continue, &quot;Love is one the most beautiful emotions and bonds can demonstrate the things that make love beautiful. Not all loves will always be foxes, BUT if the love and bond is there, THAT is all that mattered. And not all foxes love and bond fellow foxes, but because the bond is there, we have been open to welcoming honorary members. Weres other than foxes who have earned the love and formed a bond with a member of the Skulk. Martha Anderson, as a werecat, with William&#39;s bond to you, we offer the option of honorary membership.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;William has always been my one true love and there has been much good between us,&quot; Martha took William&#39;s hand, &quot;and while we may have had some rough times that we both brought on each other... becoming weres has been one of the best things we&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s strengthened everything in William that drew me to him and helped me deal with several private matters of my own. I cannot leave and will not leave my pride... but to be by William&#39;s side... to have him beside me... I would be honored to accept honorary membership in the Moon Lake Skulk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane again smiled as the others that were seated in that half circle then stood. Nate and Eric also gave a bit of a surprised gasp when they heard the sound of the chairs moving slightly against the wood. They glanced curiously to see the werefoxes in the third row who had come as guests for the event had all stood up as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guests may stand now, dear,&quot; said a vixen from Nate and Alex. Her voice was soft so not to interrupt Akane but to let the guests of the Anderson family and Jenny and Harry know that it was okay. The collection of guests then politely stood up No one noticed but Eric and Julie held hands tightly as they stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then with that,&quot; Akane spoke clearly, &quot;we close the chapter on Yvette&#39;s shadow over the Skulk as far as those present this evening may be concerned. Though we may ask a series of broad and direct questions...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First, to all new Skulk members, will you honor Moon Lake&#39;s laws regarding when and where you may transform, and be respectful for every were society in Moon Lake and THEIR rules we would demand they respect ours?&quot; Akane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; came the answer from the four new inductees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you promise to stand by a pledge to the principles all werefoxes stand for?&quot; Akane asked and then listed them, &quot;intellectualism... cunning... good humor and fun... family... and excellent performance in bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do,&quot; came the answer from the new inductees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do those of you that are foxes pledge to be here for every official Skulk meeting to discuss what we may do for Moon Lake on New Years Eve, the night before April Fools Day, the night before Halloween, and on Valentines Day?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry and Jenny both blinked as they would have their first official meeting as Skulk members on the night before their wedding, but they did join William in answering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; William, Jenny, and Harry said together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Anderson, we will not steal you from your Pride and ask that you attend as many meetings as your pride or any family events may allow,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;And you need to provide a written or emailed note to explain your reason for absence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will do my best,&quot; Martha answered, and knew that Pride meetings wouldn&#39;t be much of an issue. Frances and Samantha told her at her welcome into werecat society that her pride typically only met once a year and did most of its business via email. The meeting to let her meet her pride and welcome Jen Decker to it was a special one. She figured she could handle it fairly well.<br />
<br />
&quot;And with that,&quot; Akane spoke holding her arms out wide, &quot;Welcome to the Moon Lake Skulk, my our new brothers and sisters live long and love well.&quot;<br />
<br />
What followed was a series of claps and cheers as the Moon Lake Skulk formally inducted its newest members, even if one was only honorary.</p>
