<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kendall woke up early the next morning, deciding to dedicate the whole of her day to finding out who did this to her boyfriend. Sure they weren&#39;t exclusive, but monogamy was SO overrated these days. Just because she and Connor weren&#39;t exclusive didn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t love him. They were the quintessential duo - the head jock and the cheerleader. And it often seemed to fall to her to be the brains of the outfit. Everyone always thought Kendall would be the &quot;bimbo&quot;, everyone, even her own mother. But she was a straight &quot;A&quot; student, not that she told anyone.<br />
<br />
Kendall was no nerd, after all.<br />
<br />
There had to be some explanation. Men didn&#39;t just turn into women. It was no secret that she and Connor had a lot of enemies among the...shall we say, social undercaste. <br />
<br />
She had no idea Allen hadn&#39;t exactly done as she&#39;d told him, as she expected him to listen to her and do as she said. So when she saw some angry texts from Connor that morning, she immediately rationed out what happened - Connor had been approached and hit on by that ignoramus. &quot;And I thought Asians were supposed to be smart...&quot; Kendall mused to herself. She guessed this meant consequences were in order for Allen.<br />
<br />
Definitely no on the side sex for him from here on out. And possibly more. She had an arsenal of rumors and heresay about him she could use. Pity he&#39;d been an utter buffoon with his eye on sex.<br />
<br />
Kendall got to school early, and heard the security guard voice some surprise at this, &quot;Wow, Ms. Kendall Keener, here early?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, Bob.&quot; She said in a dark tone over her shoulder. She wasn&#39;t here to be sweet and maintain her alliances and make politick. She was here to find whoever got it in their head to magick her boyfriend into a girl, and make sure they turned him back. Kendall looked around the usual hangout spots for the socially outcasted, getting some glares, but she was used to that. Before she built her brand, nobody had the time or the patience for a girl who thought of herself as anything beyond just another girl.<br />
<br />
No, Kendall knew from the time she saw Connor Black running around without his shirt on in Eighth Grade that he was the one. The one that was going to, together with her, bring them to prominence. She&#39;d had everything planned out so well. And now some...some LOSER comes along and---<br />
<br />
Kendall paused mid step in the library, having heard that from inside one of the &quot;study rooms&quot;. Which, really, were more like safe spots for the school&#39;s nerdy population.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Are you sure it&#39;s done?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, the transformation should be finished by now. Pretty quick. I&#39;d hoped it&#39;d be done in a week, not a few days later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall wasn&#39;t exactly the raging monster her boyfriend could be. She was very well capable of being sly, careful and waiting for her opportunity. She resisted the urge to run in there screaming and accusing them. She knew what she heard, and knew it couldn&#39;t be anyone else. Approaching and looking in from the side, holding her body against the wall. She spied inside...<br />
<br />
...And saw Jenna and Josie. So that was who it was who was taking her boyfriend from her. Certainly explained some things. Jenna never got over being just a squeeze and then dropped like a hot pile of garbage, and Josie was just always kind of on the out and out.<br />
<br />
Kendall thought about her options, thinking about all she knew about Jenna and Josie and how to make use of that to her benefit. You don&#39;t get to be the Queen, Kendall thought, without getting good at knowing how to play people like a record.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Josie left the meeting with Jenna looking conflicted. She didn&#39;t know it&#39;d be done and done so fast, and Connor was looking visibly shaken the whole day as far as everyone saw. And then there was the confrontation that apparently happened between him and Allen. Josie didn&#39;t wish Allen&#39;s ways on anyone, even someone like Connor. So when Jenna had made fun of it, Josie hadn&#39;t taken that even from her friend. She had principles, dammit!<br />
<br />
And then she stopped when she saw Kendall walking over, looking completely distraught. &quot;Kendall? Uhh, is something wrong? You&#39;re not...looking like you&#39;re in your typical spot...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me,&quot; Kendall asked in a tearful, desperate tone, &quot;Am I going crazy? Connor...my...my Connor&#39;s been turned into a woman, somehow. And...And it just scares me...I think I might be going crazy...&quot; She was very audibly sobbing throughout that whole confession. &quot;I&#39;m---I&#39;m so sorry, that we were always so antagonistic, and I think Connor feels the same way...I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just...so mentally messed up by this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall dropped her backpack as if to accentuate this.<br />
<br />
Josie for all that she knew Kendall was smooth and dangerous couldn&#39;t see this and not feel like she played a role in this mental damage. She didn&#39;t understand doing this would have this kind of an effect on Kendall. She just always saw her as the powerful, cruel Queen of the School. &quot;I---I...Kendall, you&#39;re...you&#39;re not going crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall looked up, tears in her eyes, &quot;I&#39;m...not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...I&#39;m...I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; Josie said, looking down. She couldn&#39;t look at Kendall in the face and say what she was going to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...what are you sorry for? Are you---?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Josie said, in a regretful tone, &quot;I&#39;m the one that changed him. I just...I hoped that changing him would change how Connor behaved. You have to have seen what he did to all the other girls, his behavior, his attitudes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall seemed to withdraw from her, shaking and paling at the implication, &quot;D-Don&#39;t hurt me, please, we&#39;ll...we&#39;ll leave you alone, please...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to change you, Kendall. I&#39;m not...&quot; Josie looked at her with a surprising amount of pity. &quot;...The device we used, the Chronivac, I-I can change Connor back. But you have to promise me...promise that you two won&#39;t hurt me, Jenna or anyone else here at school any more. Understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall nodded frantically, shaking and sobbing again, &quot;Oh yes, please. We won&#39;t hurt even a single one of you poor girls...I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m so sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie put a hand on Kendall&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Then don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll see when I can change him back. Most likely in about four days time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall muttered some thanks and then ran off to go clean herself off. She didn&#39;t look back at Josie, and Josie swore she saw Kendall stumble a few times during her run.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Well, Kendall thought, she bought it. Hook, line, and sinker. But this did confirm to her that unless they could take the Chronivac out or make use of it themselves, Kendall and Connor would need to, ahem, play nice during the last of their time here. Thankfully, both were Juniors going on Seniors. So very little time left before heading off to be sovereigns of an even bigger stakes game.<br />
<br />
Kendall had gotten good at playing sad and desperate, it helped her survive the largesse of even crueler girls during her time as just another aspirant to the &quot;Queen Bee&quot; position. Now she knew all she needed to know, so she headed to class. Most likely Connor wasn&#39;t gonna show, and she didn&#39;t blame him. Suddenly turned into a petite girl, he was probably gonna be in a bad spot as long as this lasted.<br />
<br />
And hopefully, it would not last much longer. Four days huh...she hoped it wouldn&#39;t be a long four days. How much could go wrong in that amount of time?<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Connor woke up later that morning and, after sending some furious texts to Kendall over the whole &quot;trying to recruit fucking Allen&quot; thing, he relaxed into getting some food and watching some TV. It hurt him deeply not to be able to workout as hard or as strong as usual. He still completed his morning fitness routine, but at greater difficulty and it left him needing to take a shower after. For fucks sakes. Working up this much sweat and tears from push ups.<br />
<br />
Connor found himself shivering as he stepped under the water. Hot damn, his skin was sensitive like this. He moaned as he slipped his hand to his groin, and then his hand shot back up. He was NOT gonna let himself get acclimated to his genitals being like this. No matter how he changed, he was a MAN, first and foremost. And he was not gonna---<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, that actually does feel kind of nice...&quot; Still, he was a man after all, and he liked feeling good. Sex was a day to day thing for Connor Black, and he was not about to skip out. Even with his body changed like this.<br />
<br />
His finger lightly flicking his clit, Connor almost stumbled over in the shower, aching legs unable to hold him up so well due to the sheer intensity of the erotic sensations. Damn, was this how a girl&#39;s body felt? Ohh yeah. Connor slid right in, letting himself experiment with sensation. He WOULD never get to experience this again after they got him changed back.<br />
<br />
Might as well indulge while he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;God DAMN am I wet...&quot; If Connor was fucking the girl he&#39;d turned into, he&#39;d suggest this much wetness said she was a slut. And really, considering Connor&#39;s sex habits...maybe that was just about right.<br />
<br />
He finished up in the shower, and even still found himself experimenting, taking a satisfaction in watching the quick breaths and gasps emanating from the girl in the mirror. Even when that girl was him. How Connor wished he could experience this even more. If he could just have his male self here to---ohh wow, that was an arousing thought.<br />
<br />
Connor almost came right then and there, seeing the drip drop of his wet pussy on the towel on the floor...<br />
<br />
And his sexual experimentation was rudely interrupted by the sound of a knock at the door. Looking around, Connor hurriedly got dressed in some old clothes that even then were still pretty big on him. He hoped it was Kendall with some information despite knowing she was at school...and his sigh was audible as he checked and saw it was Allen Howard. <br />
<br />
Dressed in a stringer tank showing off his incredible physique, the Asian Adonis had obviously worked out before skipping and heading over to Casa De Black. He was wearing shorts that showed off his tight bubble butt, and had that audacious little smile on his face as usual that said &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m up to no good. Wanna do something about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor realized before long he was having a curious reaction to the muscular young man outside. Maybe it was his female body, maybe it was some facet of his change, but he was...he was yearning for sex. Almost as much as he did when he was male physically. Connor found himself sliding the door open, but keeping the security door in front of the actual door shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want, Allen?&quot; He squeaked, hating how his voice was so demure and...and yeah, sexy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, Connor, I know I acted in a way that wasn&#39;t exactly friendly, and we&#39;re bros. Been so since 7th grade.&quot; Allen was not used to apologizing, that much was obvious. He looked down, &quot;I was so bored and horny, I went right for you like that. Saw you as a novelty item. And I&#39;m...I&#39;m sorry man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor opened the security door and said, &quot;Come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allen entered, locking the doors behind him, and looked around, noting Kendall was absent, and Connor was once again dressed in ill-fitting clothes. Damn. Poor guy must be missing his muscles, Allen thought to himself. &quot;So, uhh, always did think you had a nice place. Parents always away, huge, pool in the back for parties...&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor couldn&#39;t stop staring at Allen&#39;s chest. He---He wanted to feel those muscles. See if they were as tight and strong and masculine as they looked. &quot;It...it&#39;s all good, Allen...just...uh, why are you always such a freaking horn dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...&quot; Allen looked down, &quot;It&#39;s the Asian thing. Everyone expects me to be a model minority. To be smart and shit. To be responsible and rational and logical. But that shit just ain&#39;t me. So I went the other direction. I discarded all that. I wanted to be just like the macho dudebros that run around here. And fuck, I am!&quot; He flexed his arms, showing off the impressive eighteen inchers.<br />
<br />
And Connor couldn&#39;t help himself but touch them. He reached out ad touched Allen&#39;s arm. Both halted and Connor pulled back.<br />
<br />
Allen surveyed the situation and asked, &quot;...Are you okay, man? Because ever since I got here, you&#39;ve been acting even weirder. Are you uhh...&quot; Allen scratched the back of his head, not knowing how to say that right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Connor said in a defeated tone, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m...I think it&#39;s my body. I&#39;m...I&#39;m into you. And I...I want to do you.&quot; He couldn&#39;t help but blush afterwards, and waited for the ridicule. The &quot;lol you&#39;re so homo&quot; nonsense.<br />
<br />
Instead, Allen said to him, &quot;You&#39;re...you&#39;re sure?&quot; He crossed his arms in front of his chest, &quot;You&#39;re sure you wanna screw around with me. I just want to make sure before going forward. You&#39;re not under any fucking spell. You&#39;re not obligated to sex, or mentally hit. You&#39;re...choosing this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes Allen!&quot; Connor said, in a desperate tone, he was feeling weak in the legs from how needy he was. And with Allen right here and definitely the type to provide? He couldn&#39;t help himself, &quot;I...I consent. I consent the whole way. F-Fuck me silly, Allen.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of Allen&#39;s shirt being thrown off of him drew Connor&#39;s attention to his masculine physique. Allen wasn&#39;t kidding when he called himself the Asian Adonis. He was built, on every single muscle group, and Connor was loving that so much. And right now Connor was beyond control. He licked and tasted at Allen&#39;s muscles, drawing a moan from the stud when his tongue tasted the guy&#39;s nipple.<br />
<br />
Connor got the treatment himself as Allen helped him out of his shirt, and then guided him over to one of the long couches, kissing at Connor&#39;s breasts, dragging out long, gasping moans from the changed Junior. Connor took off his pants and underwear, giving Allen full access...just in time for the stud to start kissing at his pussy.<br />
<br />
Allen delighted obviously in the screaming that ensued; &quot;OHHHHH! OHHH ALLEN I LOVE IT! I LOVE YOUR TONGUE AND---OHHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
As new as Connor was to the female body, he was obviously attuned to what felt good. The sound of Allen&#39;s shorts hitting the floor followed soon, and Connor found himself looking headlong at Allen&#39;s cock. Just another stereotype Allen disproved - the man&#39;s dick was huge. Almost made Connor both scared and shake with anticipation at how it would FEEL going into him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it to me, Allen.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sounds of the two lovers, over the course of the next thirty minutes, filled the empty house.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Allen got dressed after the sex was done, and DAMN what amazing sex it was. He was almost tempted to start chatting up his bros at school about how great a lay the new female Connor was...but he remembered what happened and consciously decided against that. &quot;Damn you were great for your first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-Thanks,&quot; Connor replied, &quot;You were...you&#39;re amazing. Your body is just...so buff. I swear, how did I never notice you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh,&quot; Allen said, stretching a bit as he fitted his shirt back on him, &quot;It&#39;s cuz I&#39;m just in general an awesome fuck. Call me up...&quot; Allen put a slip of paper on the couch by the still nude Connor, &quot;If you want another hot hookup with me. And don&#39;t worry about me and my big mouth. I&#39;m not telling anybody at school about you and your problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor found himself sitting there, alarmingly content as Allen left. He admitted, he liked the way Allen treated him. Liked being fucked. Liked how big and strong Allen was. Connor still wanted to go back to being a man but...well, now there was a definite hangup about it. Going back to being a man, he&#39;d never experience that again. How intense it was. And Allen probably wouldn&#39;t want Connor as a man.<br />
<br />
Just more, Connor thought as he turned on the TV and pulled a blanket over himself, to think about.</p>
