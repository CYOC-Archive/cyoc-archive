<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Jess” rolls her eyes, she then sighs once again, “So, What Do You Want To Do?” She asks.<br />
<br />
Mason Says &quot;Let&#39;s Go To The Mall&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I Don&#39;t Want To Go To The Mall,&quot; &quot;Jess&quot; says.<br />
<br />
Mason smiles, &quot;Come On, It&#39;ll Be Fun,&quot; He says, &quot;We Can See The New Movie, &quot;The Darkest Hour&quot; I Know You&#39;ve Been Dying To See It.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess&quot; scowls at her friend, before finally sighing, &quot;Fine But Only Because I&#39;ve Wanted To See That Movie, So Let&#39;s Go,&quot; Jess says, &quot;But If I Am <br />
Not Enjoying Myself, Then We&#39;re Leaving!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mason chuckles, &quot;I&#39;ll Make Sure That You Have A Good Time Then.&quot; he says, &quot;I Promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess&quot; rolls her eyes, &quot;I Doubt That, But I&#39;ll Give You The Benefit Of The Doubt Since You&#39;ll Be Paying&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
Mason Chuckles And Leads His Friend Towards His Car.<br />
<br />
Mason Opens The Passenger Door Of His Black 2013 Lexus IS-F Coupe, Allowing Jess To Get In. Mason Walks Over To The Driver&#39;s Side And Gets In. They Drive To The Mall In Comfortable Silence. Upon Arriving At The Mall, Mason Leads Jess Inside. They Walk Around Till They Arrive At The Movie Theatre But The Next Movie Isn&#39;t For 2 Hours So Mason Offered To Take Jess Around The Mall While They Waited For The Movie To Start. Jess Agreed.<br />
<br />
Jess And Mason Walk Around For A Little While Before Deciding To Go To A Clothing Store. As They Are Looking Around, Jess Sees A Limited Edition Hoodie, It Is Black With The Words &quot;My Hair Color Is Natural&quot; In Hot Pink. Jess Looks At It And Smiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;See Something You Like?&quot; Mason Asks Jess, Seeing The Smile.<br />
<br />
Jess Nods, &quot;I&#39;ve Always Wanted One Of These Hoodies But They Sell Out Fast,&quot; She Says<br />
<br />
&quot;You Can But It And It&#39;ll Probably Transform Like The Rest Of Your Clothes Did When You Change Back...?&quot; Mason Says<br />
<br />
&quot;No... It&#39;s Way To Expensive...For A Single Hoodie, You&#39;d Have To Be Rich,&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
Mason Pulls Out His Credit Card, &quot;Here, Buy It.&quot; He Says<br />
<br />
Jess Scowls, &quot;Why?&quot; She Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause, I&#39;m Your Best Friend And Your Doing Me A Huge Favor So I Don&#39;t Mind Doing One For You, So Just Shut Up And Take It,&quot; Mason Says With A Chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Mason,&quot; Jess Says Happily, Taking The Card And Walking To The Checkout Counter. She Buys The Hoodie, Puts It On, And Returns Mason&#39;s Card To Him. They Walk Around More Jess Was Now Happy In Her Hoodie, Mason Then Brought Them To A Photo Booth, &quot;Get In&quot; He Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Why?&quot; Jess Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause, We Are Taking Photos To Remember Today By,&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I Don&#39;t Exactly Wanna Remember Today...&quot; Jess Says And Gets In, Mason Joins Her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I Do So Please?&quot; Mason Begs <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine... But Only Because You Bought Me The Hoodie&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
The First Picture Is Of Mason Wrapping His Arms Around Jess.<br />
The Second Is Of Jess Kissing Mason&#39;s Cheek. (A Fake Pose Which Mason Begged For)<br />
The Third Is Of Both Of Them Smiling.<br />
The Fourth Is Of Jess Making A Weird Face And Mason Sticking His Tongue Out.<br />
The Last Picture Is Of Both Of Them Kissing But Actually There Was A Gap Between Them As It Was A Staged Picture Since Jess Didn&#39;t Actually Wanna Kiss Him...<br />
<br />
After That They Left And Walked Around Some More Till It Was Time For The Movie. They Went Inside Got Popcorn And Started To Watch The Movie &quot;The Darkest Hour&quot; It Was A Horror Movie And While Jess Really Loved Horror Movies She Got Scared Very Easily So She Absolutely Refuses To Watch Them Alone...It Was Around The Half Way Point Of The Movie When Jess Gets Scared, She Looks Around To See That No One Is In Their Row So She Hides Her Head In Mason&#39;s Shoulder, Mason, Knowing She Was Scared, Wraps His Arm Around Her. Which She Hold On To Somewhat Tightly.<br />
<br />
 Later During The Movie That Jess Realizes What She Is Doing And Let&#39;s Go Of His Hand, &quot;Sorry,&quot; She Says Blushing, She Hadn&#39;t Realized She&#39;d Been Holding His Hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t Be, You Were Scared, I Understand.&quot; Mason Says Smiling At Her.<br />
<br />
They Continue Watching The Movie, Until Jess Gets Scared Again Badly This Time Instead Of Hiding His Arm, She Hides It In His Chest, Holding His Shirt Tightly. Mason Wraps His Arms Around Her Once Again Making Her Feel Secure, She Doesn&#39;t Let Go Until After The Movie Is Over, Mason Leads Jess Back Outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;That Was Scary,&quot; Jess Says<br />
<br />
&quot;You Shoulda Been Scared, You Looked Terrified Half The Time.&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut Up,&quot; Jess Says Poking His Side<br />
<br />
&quot;I Don&#39;t Know Why You Love Horror Movies So Much If You Get Scared So Easily.&quot; Mason Says Teasing Her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut Up,&quot; Jess Says Again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I Don&#39;t Think I Will.&quot; Mason Says, Jess Glares At Him, &quot;Okay, Okay, Fine But Seriously?.&quot; Mason Says Chuckling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why Do People Enjoy Rollercoasters? Or Haunted Houses Or Anything Similar They Are Designed To Be Scary... And Thrilling In A Way <br />
That You Can Enjoy It Safely, Kind Of Like How A Book Or Movie Does It,&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
Mason Grins, &quot;Whatever You Say, Come On,&quot; He Says, Starting To Walk Reaching Out His Hand<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Where Are We Going?&quot; Jess Asks, Walking Next To Him And Grabbing His Hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back Home, Cause That&#39;s All We Can Do.&quot; Mason Says<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Please Can&#39;t We Stay Here Just A Little Longer?&quot; Jess Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve Already Been Gone 3 Hours&quot; Mason Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Come On Please,&quot; Jess Begs, Pleading With Him.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Why Aren&#39;t You The One Itching To Change Back...?&quot; He Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Cause 3 More Hours As A Girl Won&#39;t Kill Me And Today Has Been Fun So I Would Rather Not End The Day Just Yet...&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
Mason Sighs, &quot;I Don&#39;t Think It&#39;s A Good Idea, We&#39;ve Already Been Out Too Long.&quot; He Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Another 30 Minutes Please,&quot; Jess Begs Again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jess... No, I Don&#39;t Think It&#39;s A Good Idea...&quot; Mason Says Firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Come On, Pretty Please I See An Ice Cream Shop Let&#39;s Just Head There Eat Then We Can Go Home&quot; Jess Begs Pouting.<br />
<br />
Mason Finally Sighs, &quot;Fine, But Only Cause Think You Won&#39;t Relent Otherwise, We Can Get Some Ice Cream Then I&#39;m Taking You Home, Deal?&quot; He Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal,&quot; Jess Says With A Smile Knowing She Was Gonna Win<br />
<br />
They Go To The Ice Cream Shop, Mason Gets A Strawberry Cone Which Is Jess&#39;s Favorite Flavor, While Jess Got Chocolate. They Sat Down And Ate Jess Was Quick To Finish Her Cone But Couldn&#39;t Stop Eyeing His Which He Was Very Slow At Eating. Jess Then Moved Over To Sit By Mason As He Continued Eating His Cone Then She Licked His Cone Making Him Freeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Are You Doing?&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eating Ice Cream.&quot; Jess Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;With My Cone?&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is There Another One Somewhere?&quot; Jess Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no,&quot; Mason Says, Jess Smiles And Takes Another Small Lick From His Cone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was Yours Not Enough?&quot; Mason Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;It Would Have Been But... Strawberry Is My Favorite And Your Eating It So Slow... Your Practically Begging Me To Steal Some...&quot; Jess Sticks Out Her Tongue For Another Lick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Almost Done With It&quot; Mason Says, Taking A Large Bite And Gets An Ice Cream Headache. &quot;Ahh&quot; He Says As Leans Over On To Jess&#39;s Shoulders... He Then Tries To Say Sorry And Get Up But Jess Held His Head There, Running Her Hand Through His Hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Don&#39;t Move Your Still In Pain, Here Let Me Help,&quot; Jess Says, Mason, Tilts His Head Up, Jess Places A Hand On His Forehead Her Warm Hand Made Mason Feel Immediately Better, And He Wraps His Arms Around Jess And Kisses Her Lips Before Jess Breaks It Off Really Unsure About Her Feelings...<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, You Taste Like Chocolate.&quot; Mason Says<br />
<br />
Jess Smiles, &quot;And You Taste Like Strawberry...&quot; She Says, <br />
<br />
Before Mason Kisses Her Again, &quot;Let&#39;s Go Home Now, Okay?&quot; He Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Jess Says While Blushing, And Standing Up And Helping Mason To His Feet,<br />
<br />
&quot;I Can Walk You Know.&quot; Mason Says<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah But What&#39;s Wrong With Me Helping You?&quot; Jess Asks<br />
<br />
Mason Sighs, &quot;You&#39;ve Been Doing That A Lot Today...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I&#39;ve Been Doing What A Lot?&quot; Jess Asks, Confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Helping Me, You&#39;ve Done So Much For Me, And I&#39;ve Only Done Little For You And Why Have You Been Acting This  Way We&#39;ve Kissed Twice And You Haven&#39;t Said Anything!&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Being The Girlfriend You Want Me To Be Right? You Wanted Someone To Hang Out With Who Wouldn&#39;t Bitch And Complain...Right? Since You Were Paying, Bought Me This Really Expensive Hoodie And Were Such A Gentlemen During The Movie The Least I Can Do Is Kiss You A Few Times And Have Some Fun... Plus Today Was So Much Fun A Lot More Then We Usually Have So Why Not?&quot; Jess Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Just Surprised You Were So Cooperative... I Thought You Would&#39;ve Bitched More.&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
Jess Giggles, &quot;I Would Have If I Today Wasn&#39;t Gonna Be As Fun As It Ended Up Being.&quot; She Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;And What Made Today So Fun?&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause I Got To Play With A Boy And Kissed One!&quot; Jess Says Smiling. Teasing<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha... No I&#39;m Being Serious&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your So Annoying, Fine, Today Was Fun, Because We Did Something Different, I Liked Spending The Day With You Like This, Cause Despite Us Being Friends We Usually Just Hang Out In One Of Our Houses And While I Enjoy Those Times Today Was Special And It Really Felt That Way, Like We Were On A Date.&quot; Jess Says, Looking At Her Feet Blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... That&#39;s Why...&quot; Mason Says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Now Come On, Let&#39;s Go Home,&quot; Jess Says As They Made Their Way To Mason&#39;s Car.<br />
<br />
Mason Begins Driving The Long Way Back To Jess&#39;s House And Jess Falls Asleep In The Car, When He Arrives, Mason Carries Jess Her To Her Room When She Wakes Up... &quot;Mason I&#39;m Home?&quot; Jess Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, You Feel Asleep In The Car So I Carried You Into Your House Were Almost At Your Room... You Ready To Turn Back?&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I&#39;d Love To... But First&quot; Jess Then While Still In Mason Arms Bridal Style Wraps Her Hands Around Mason&#39;s Neck And Kisses Him, Mason Smiles Into The Kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Was That For?&quot; Mason Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I Just Had Too A Little Goodbye From Jess... But Now It&#39;s Time To Say Hello To Jeff.&quot; Jess Says, As She Gets Let Down From Mason&#39;s Arms And Sits Down At The Computer And Turns On The Program... Mason Whispers Goodbye &quot;Jess&quot; And Jess Went To Hit Enter...</p>
