<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jasmine's sped to the door was thwarted by her tail being grabbed. 'Blast that useless <br />
thing!' Jasmine cursed as the pain went straight though her spinal cord.  She was quickly <br />
followed by one of her legs at the ankle, both her arms at the wrist, and finally a switch <br />
over from the tail to the other foot. <br />
<br />
Jasmine turned her head to see Roberta had recovered much faster than she should have <br />
ever been able to. Bits of sand came in from almost nowhere to fill in the holes made by <br />
Jasmine's shots. 'Cheap trick!' But her attention was drawn away from this the shiva vixen <br />
grew a third pair of arms! Both new hands held a scimitar that would cleanly cleave her in <br />
two if they both connected with her waist. Jasmine wasn't about to give the puppet a <br />
chance however and sent a -massive- electric charges through her body and into <br />
Roberta's, forcing the nerves to react involuntary and releasing the Arab messenger. <br />
<br />
In a split second Jasmine did a summersault taking advantage of her body's limber form <br />
and kicked the shiva vixen in the chin knocking Roberta back multiple yards.  Jasmine <br />
landed perfectly on one foot and twirled around, forming body armor on her form in the <br />
same motion, including her tail, she wouldn't be caught unprotected twice.  Neither it <br />
seemed would Roberta be caught off guard again. <br />
<br />
Jasmine's spiritual sight could actually -see- Roberta's nervous system rearranging itself <br />
to prevent Jasmine's trick from working twice. <br />
<br />
Net, spear, spiked shield, and diamond hard gladius formed from sand that the palace was <br />
made from, the atoms of the silicon rearranging in ways that would have alchemist dying <br />
from the sheer illogic. Then again, kitesune magic was never known for being too <br />
consistent with itself.  <br />
<br />
Gathering herself however, Jasmine was pleased, 'Good, Tamthis is feeding more and more <br />
power into his guardian, okay baby girl, if you want to prove your parents weren't fools so <br />
badly, I've give you the chance. What the? The others in the great hall, they're all, going <br />
somewhere else? Where? Hmmm. Good. Less distractions for me means less distractions <br />
for the newbie.' Jasmine felt no regrets, Vicki and her sisters were all soldiers now, they <br />
knew what they were signing up for. <br />
<br />
Akira sat underneath the table munching on his leg of lamb, 'Dang! Wish I knew enough <br />
about electronics to summon up a tape recorder. Good thing those guards didn't look too <br />
closely at my faux techno-toys before... I could make a real fortune selling this fight to the <br />
news networks.' Akira had been a direct victim of forces he didn't think had existed until <br />
he was one of Karther's love puppets, he had no desire to see those things remain hidden <br />
even if he was now one of them. 'I need to relax more.' In a puff of smoke Akira was Anna <br />
again, 'I still think Akane would be a good name for this form.... wish this leg of lamb <br />
didn't have a sandy taste to it.' <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Keiko looked at the fox and wolf people, their preset programming disrupted by the huge <br />
battle breaking out in the palace, they were now winging it, after all they had been told the <br />
attack would come from the outside not inside. 'Oddly, this makes them more like people <br />
than when they were just happily playing their role. I like oddly.' Keiko thought giggling to <br />
herself. She had never really appreciated the freedom of thinking that kitesune had, logic <br />
was an acquaintance, reason a long distance friend. That wasn't to say she couldn't call <br />
them up when needed, but she no longer felt a need to be close to them. That made her <br />
think, (which kitesune were actually fully able and completely willing to do despite what <br />
some thought). <br />
<br />
&quot;You feeling any more crazy or furry from snacking on my blood?&quot;<br />
<br />
'No, not really. I've been alive a very long time, and I've learned to take precautions. If I was <br />
your average Joe, I'm sure I'd be feeling some 'interesting' side effects. But the same <br />
immunity I've created to protect me from were-beast and undeath curses work very well <br />
against the much less aggressive but much more sly magic traits in your blood.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Dissapointed?'<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw. Just amused. Unlike just about any other kitesune on the planet save for Anna/Akira, <br />
I can laugh at myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I'm impressed.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Never waste a good laugh, no matter the source.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Many would disagree with that.'<br />
<br />
&quot;They're note kitesune.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Neither were you until a few days ago.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Point...With all these people panicking, it's time for some fun I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Coming here was so not a good idea.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, the battle is in the palace... what could go wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
'Famous last words. And please, don't turn into a dijinn or something of the like, you'll <br />
have loyal subjects attacking you from every which way. Or people trampling other people <br />
to death in their desperate attempt to flee from you.'<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you my conscience? ... &quot;<br />
<br />
'Just the voice of common sense, which could have prevented the very sticky end of many <br />
kitesune I've run into over the centuries.'  He quickly added, 'And seriously, I don't think <br />
the kitesune species can afford to have you end up a throw rug.' <br />
<br />
A fennec bumped into the japanese kitesune, took one look at her and said, &quot;Out of my <br />
way Jap!&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio could taste Keiko's blood boil, 'Don't do it. You won't prove anything, and you won't <br />
solve anything either, besides, these people have been programmed to be this way. Your <br />
sisters are busy taking out the cause, you came here just for some fun and games right?'<br />
<br />
Sigh sighed, &quot;Right.... &quot;<br />
<br />
'Just be careful, mixing magics is dangerous remember? You zap these people into <br />
anything you'll make it that much harder for them to be restored to humans later.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please~.... you think I don't have any magic tricks besides poofing people into other <br />
things? I am much more original than that.&quot; 'Guess that crosses off turning the men into <br />
wives and the wives into men.' <br />
<br />
'Oh and one VERY big warning here Keiko, you maybe too distracted to feel it, but I can <br />
feel it, or rather, I can SEE the patterns. This city, it'll assimilate anyone whose not already <br />
part of the setting. Be careful little kitesune or you're going to get turned into just another <br />
character in Tamthis' arab fairy tale setting.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Traitor! I don't want or need your pity!&quot; Kathy screamed as she quickly sprang to try and <br />
claw Alexandra's eyes out. Alexandra however had been a working woman, not a pleasure <br />
pet, and easily enough able to keep her at bay. <br />
<br />
As the truths continued to pour into Alexandra's brain, she shuddered as deeper truths <br />
began to worm their way into her brain, she couldn't stop them now, she had opened the <br />
door, and they would not be stopped now. 'No! Nononono! Those are just dreams! <br />
Dreams! They aren't real! They can't be real! No! No! No!' Alexandra grimaced. <br />
<br />
'A pop-ad came up at his screen, odd since he had protection against that sort of thing. <br />
He moved to close it when he noticed what it said, and figured since he was dumping this <br />
computer soon anyway it didn't matter if it caught a virus. It was 'Do you want to be a fox <br />
girl?' Finding it amuse he clicked yes. 'Would you be willing to leave your current live <br />
behind?' Thinking about it, and not having that high an opinion of his own life he clicked <br />
yes again. 'Would you be willing to leave the person you are behind?' Again, not thinking <br />
too much of himself, he clicked yes again. 'Would you be willing to learn a new culture?' <br />
finding it an unique challenge and knowing this was just a spam trap anyway he clicked <br />
yes one more time. 'Do you not want to be lonely.' He clicked that one on instinct. 'Are you <br />
sure?' Dang this was an odd pop-up ad, must have gotten a nickel for every click or <br />
something, he clicked yes one last time. <br />
<br />
With the first click, the tails had formed, then the fur, then the gender, then the whole <br />
species, and finally, the entire mind-set. 'What an interesting dream I am having.' Said the <br />
new kitesune vixen. She had walked to the dream room's door, and opened it to the <br />
waking world. She discarded the clothes from her dream, burned them, and put on the <br />
clothing waiting for her in the waking world. She saw the most handsome sage kitesune <br />
she had ever seen, exposed and wearing nothing but a cape. She fell to her kneels and <br />
said without a first thought, 'My prince, command me.' <br />
<br />
'Rise.' He commanded.<br />
<br />
She did so. Dang, was he just hansom! <br />
<br />
She asked what brought her prince here, he informed her he simply wished to see how his <br />
favorite servant was doing. 'I'm his favorite!' She thought with glee.<br />
<br />
He asked as a test what her duties all were, which she easily answered. He seemed rather <br />
surprised when she kept inching towards him. Satisfied he left, saying under his breath <br />
something about 'too slow' and 'stupid rules.' '<br />
<br />
The absolute truth struck Alexandra's mind. 'I asked for this.... I did this... to myself...' <br />
That was when reality came back and she realized Kathy had her hands around her throat, <br />
she had taken advantage of Alexandra's flash back. Reality didn't stop just because you <br />
were dreaming. She quickly struck the points that women hurt at, and got her off herself. <br />
&quot;I don't want to hurt you Kathy!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You want to murder our king! That's good enough reason!&quot; <br />
<br />
In the blink of an eye Erica was front of Kathy and gave her a punch so fast and so hard to <br />
the gut it almost buldged on the other side, Kathy fell on the floor quite unconscious. <br />
&quot;That didn't feel good... not at all...&quot; Erica muttered in almost dissapointment. She looked <br />
at Alexandra, &quot;Sorry, but I had a feeling she wasn't going to calm down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's... okay...&quot; Alexandra muttered. 'But... what is the point of her? And what is the point of <br />
me?' <br />
<br />
Lisa meanwhile was thinking, 'If not for Jasmine and her dijinn I might be able to make her <br />
whole right now.' Sadly, that had not been the case, and Jasmine's pushing of the deadline <br />
had left Lisa, like her sisters, refined into fighting machines. Lisa still knew some basic <br />
healing techniques and how to use them on others. She could speed up the healing <br />
process while not damaging the person's life span, 'but regenerating destroyed limbs is <br />
going to take more than what I know.' The legs were easy to heal. But the shiva's vixen's <br />
lost four arms were not so easily revised. <br />
<br />
Jennifer however was oblivious for at least a few more seconds on her missing body parts, <br />
Karther had made her immune to pain and system shock after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you remember?&quot; Vicki asked the shiva vixen, &quot;Do you remember where you are? <br />
Do you remember who you -really- are?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at the angel vixen in some level of confusion and growing dread, but <br />
managed to answer anyway, &quot;Sergeant Gene V.C.  10293847.&quot; She on reaction from years <br />
of conditioning. &quot;And... I can feel it comin' back... you were all runnin' from who she used <br />
to be.&quot; She tried to move her arm again and simply looked in Kathy's general direction. <br />
&quot;And I was supposed to stop ya... then one of you darlin's went all crazy-er.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did Karther kidnap you from?&quot; Erica asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;He didn't... kinda... some orange haired man with an odd hop in his step came by the war <br />
vets home... and he asked if any of us would be interested in -doing- something with <br />
ourselves rather than sitting around waiting to die.  My son hadn't visited me in a year <br />
since I along with a couple others wanted some more details. He said he wanted people <br />
with all our combat experience... so she shoved a contract under our noses with a bunch <br />
of legal bla-bla-bla. Yes I know I should have known better! Don't give me that look! Yes a <br />
couple of our friends said this guy had to be a con artist or something.... after we all <br />
signed it... turns out it was 'or something...' and damn what a something... &quot;<br />
<br />
Luna had to ask, &quot;How old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I came all here? Sixty-Nine. Now hurry up and give me back my winkles before I <br />
start thinking that boobs and fur aren't a bad trade off for an extended-lease from the <br />
grim reaper!&quot; <br />
<br />
The angels vixens all looked at each other, only Luna cringed, the idea of being in <br />
Jennifer's helpless position scared her. Lisa said, &quot;I'll try, and my sisters will too.&quot; However <br />
there was one part of the shiva vixen's story that frightened the angel soldier very much, <br />
&quot;Do you know where the contract is that you and your friends signed is?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; The amputee grimanced, &quot;I don't.&quot; She finally looked at the right angle, she finally <br />
saw the two stumps on one side, and the two stumps on the other. Snap, crackle, pop.  <br />
<br />
&quot;My arms? MY ARMS! I GO FROM TWO TO FOUR TO ZERO! Heheh! MY ARMS! Bwahah! Can I <br />
get six with interest? Or do I get four breasts next? Hehehehh!&quot; One clonk on the head <br />
later, Jennifer was as silent as Kathy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Luna!&quot; Vicki snapped at the angle vixen soldier holding one of the shiva vixen's limbs she <br />
had just used to knock her out with. <br />
<br />
&quot;... saw it in a movie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You watch too many movies!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;They're coming!&quot; Lisa's pools of blood widened in alarm as she felt them, &quot;Lucy, Natalie! <br />
Others! They're coming!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What we didn't need!&quot; Vicki said, &quot;Lisa, you look after Alexandra, Jennifer, and Kathy, yes <br />
Kathy! Luna, Erica, you watch each other's backs and keep Natalin and the rest occupied! <br />
... I'll try my hardest to subdue Lucy.&quot; <br />
<br />
The three other angel vixen nearly nodded in acknowledgement. That was when they felt <br />
the hot desert wind, and the howls and snarls coming up from below. <br />
<br />
She formed on the marble railing of the harem house's massive balcony and window in <br />
plain sight of the angel vixens. Erica and Luna felt sick, Lisa felt pity, and Vicki just felt <br />
horrorfied. She LOOKED like an angel to mundane eyes, but that was all. 'It's like... she's, <br />
her soul is a patch work doll.' <br />
<br />
Those orbs of obsidian met Lisa's orbs of crimson. &quot;Lisa, the rest of you... you've come <br />
home... and ... you all feel so powerful... I felt a threat and found you... come.. let's go <br />
protect our new Amir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; Luna said, too tired and too burned out from everything life had thrown at her to <br />
play a part. &quot;You're sick Lucy! And we're here to help cure you, Natalie, and yeah, even that <br />
new king of yours!&quot; 'It's what Janice would have wanted.' <br />
<br />
 &quot;Heh. We are not ill, we are free of such things now, but I see that you lot are all not quite <br />
right in the head, don't worry, our Amir will have your head back on straight soon <br />
enough.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Sorry Lucy.&quot; Vicki said calmly walking towards her, tossing aside the shawl and <br />
forming her body armor around her. With a hand motion she willed a halberd into <br />
existence. &quot;That's not going to happen. But I will save you or die trying, that is a promise.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't make promises you can't keep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not. I'm going to either save you or die in the attempt...&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna and Erica would have joined their eldest sister, but they had been given their orders, <br />
and would trust that Vicki knew what she was doing. <br />
<br />
That was when the door smashed down, and a huge wolf beast covered in muscles, and <br />
similar creatures behind it but with fang like horns between their legs. The lead wolf beast <br />
howled and growled at the angel clothed in vixen bodies. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah Natalie you're here!&quot; Lucy said cheerfully. &quot;Let's put our sisters back in their right state <br />
of mind so they can help us protect our Amir, doesn't that sound nice?&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie nodded and growled. Yes that sounded like a very good idea. <br />
<br />
&quot;Natalie...&quot; Erica said in pure dismay... 'Please please let her be in there somewhere!' <br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to say you, all of you.&quot; Nicki said holding her crucifix.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's the evil thing that clouded all our thinking before!&quot; Lucy pointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;... It is not evil... it is love and self sacrifice... of one's own free-will!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Natalie had heard enough, she snarled and leapt at her her misled siblings, they would <br />
become with the sand she was... <br />
<br />
Lisa grabbed the three mundane vixens in the pillow infested room and brought up the <br />
best defensive barrier she could. She looked at Alexandra... who seemed to be in a state of <br />
shock... 'At least she looks like she's still thinking. Luna, Erica, Vicki, and you too Kyriel, <br />
may God be with you sisters.' <br />
<br />
Several seconds later, the room exploded as the powerful forces collided, Vicki and Lucy <br />
into the sky, with Luna and Erica landing with Natalie and her pack in the streets below. <br />
And Lisa, doing her best to keep the non-combatants from dying. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
'Okay Kyriel, what do you do now?' She thought to herself. 'If I try hard enough, I'm sure I <br />
could blast Tamthis to atom and come out of it with this body still alive. But that would kill <br />
Tommy in the process. Hey! ... I can remember his male name! Janice/Jake was freaked out <br />
that she couldn't! Or remember her own male name for that matter! Cool!' Kyriel folded on <br />
her legs as a sand stone fist the size of a semi-truck flew over her head. 'Ugh! Not going <br />
to make keeping me alive and finding anything left of Jake in there any easier! This is so <br />
stupid! Tommy was the new comer! Jake had been Karther's slave for much longer than <br />
that!.. In fact... it was Jake... who suggested Tommy be added to the harem...' Kryiel shook <br />
her head and took flight as the ENTIRE floor near and around her exploded into jagged <br />
spikes! 'Stop it Kryi'! Now's not the time to feel Jake/Janice's guilt right now!~ Besides she <br />
was brainwashed, she would have never done that in her right state of mind! Now move-<br />
move-move!' Tamthis tried to bisect Kyriel with a scimitar twice as long as he was, the <br />
weapon forming of the sand and dust even as he sliced with it and wedged itself in the <br />
throne room's stone floor. Tamthis instantly discarded it and the weapon returned to sand <br />
as quickly as it was called form. <br />
<br />
Kyriel had to do a corkscrew spin to avoid the chains and bondage gear that formed out of <br />
the ceiling even as she did her best to avoid the spikes on the floor. 'This isn't working. <br />
And he's being infinitely more imaginative than Karther was when he fought T'. So ... how <br />
do I win?'  A memory came up in Kyriel's head, a cheap kung-fu movie that both T' and <br />
Jake had once watched ironically enough. T' watched it to try and understand human <br />
subculture better, and Jake cause he had nothing to do that afternoon.  'Win... by not <br />
fighting...' <br />
<br />
'Mom, dad, you two so owe me for this one.' Kyriel blasted the stone spikes to dust and <br />
landed and ignoring Tamthis assumed a semi-meditative pose. <br />
<br />
This was enough to make Tamthis hesitate in confusion for a few seconds. Which was all <br />
Kyriel needed to order her body to give up the ghost. Tamthis and Jasmine BOTH started at <br />
this, costing Jasmine an ear by Roberta! Kyriel's body simply slumped over and hit the <br />
sandy ground with a thud. <br />
<br />
Tamthis' limited spiritual sight never saw the angel leaving her meaningless shell behind <br />
dove right into Tamthis' head. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
Kyriel landed softly, looking around, it was pitch black. 'Great, now where am I?' <br />
<br />
Spreading her wings slightly she saw a traditional American living room carpet... with a <br />
great need for vacuuming with all the sand everywhere. <br />
<br />
Kyriel didn't question when she was suddenly in a maid outfit doing exactly that with a <br />
'777Miracle' model vacuum cleaner. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woman! Who commanded ye to remove my precious sand!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyriel turned around, and did not curtsies as a she normally would and a maid should at <br />
seeing the person before her. He was a muscular fox, tall, MANY tails, only wearing a cape <br />
and his manhood exposed. It wasn't Karther. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good sir, I am removing your sand for the TRUE master of the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;--I-- am the true master of the house servant!&quot; <br />
<br />
The kitesune man was sitting on a royal European throne with the made from sand and the <br />
rest out of red velvet gold and jewels, rising high above the couches and coffee table in <br />
the living room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rape her!&quot; Said a massive male humanoid wolf also adorned with many tails chained to <br />
the throne on one side, &quot;Rape the maid!&quot; Half of his body was made out of clay. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eat her!&quot;  Said a massive female humanoid wolf also adorned with many tails chained to <br />
the throne on the other side, &quot;Eat the maid!&quot; The opposite side of her body was made from <br />
clay, and had the same glowing green eye. <br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Said a sultry voice behind Kyri' the angel fox maid turned to see the epitome of <br />
womanhood laying on a couch like a roman queen. She had glowing yellow eyes, long <br />
wavy black hair, and was managed to have a flawless figure without her proportion being <br />
absurd.  &quot;Let us give the maid pleasure, then have her give but pleasure, so pleasure be all <br />
that she knows and does, for pleasure is the only real goal of living after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please...&quot; Said a fox woman who looked very much like the first but with fewer tails and <br />
with a slightly more sane figure, but still had the aura of magic about her, in fact, <br />
something of her felt slightly familiar to Tabra's memories. She was sitting rather than <br />
laying on a couch next to the first woman. &quot;Miss Maid, have you seen Karther? Have you <br />
seen my loving prince Karther? I am his betrothed but I can not find him anywhere... please <br />
little maid... where is the prince of all kitesune that I am destine to marry?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyri' looked down at herself, and again didn't question when she found her biological age <br />
had been cut in half and her maid outfit had shrunk to match her new size and shape. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marry?!&quot; Said a kitesune lass with some more muscle on her bones and with a less <br />
fantastic figure but somehow a bit more absurd.  She lepted onto the couch's back edge <br />
and tittered back and forth on it like she was on a permanent sugar rush.  &quot;That's silly! <br />
Who wants to -marry-?! Just have sex! Who cares about any of the rest! It doesn't matter <br />
who you have sex with as long as you do. It's not like we have any other purpose in life <br />
anything.&quot; Kyri then noticed the plastic sheen and little too uniform nature of her fur. The <br />
lass' eyes moved and looked but they were made from glass or plastic. She reminded Kyri' <br />
of a doll. 'Not that... I've ever had a chance to play with any...' <br />
<br />
Kyri' felt something soft in her arms and didn't need to look to see that it was the plush <br />
foxy stuff animal she owned. She dropped her vacuum cleaner. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! How about letting ME join in the fun already?! I agree with most of your guys as it! <br />
Well, the ones who are guys! Let me have some of the fun too already!&quot; Said a male crude <br />
and rude voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Most... illogical... your joining in there actions would result in your elimination as a <br />
separate part of the awareness and only add to their natural presence.&quot; Said a proper <br />
spoken and very calm voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here's a question-who care?!-&quot; Said the crude and rude voice again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey little girl! Yeah you! You're not from this house hold are ya?! Ya said you want the <br />
proper own back right? That's me! Or at least I think that's me--&quot; Said a voice that <br />
sounded very familiar a set of memories not Kyri's. <br />
<br />
Kryi' turned around, still holding her toy and still in her maid outfit, she saw three people <br />
chained to the wall behind the throne and blind folded and gaged, so how they were <br />
talking felt Kryi' curious.<br />
<br />
The one on the left speaking in a rude manner was somewhat muscular in appearance and <br />
whose expression seemed to change every few seconds. He also had wolf ears and a tail <br />
but was otherwise human. <br />
<br />
The one on the right was.... a Vulcan? And dressed when he belonged on a Federation Star <br />
Ship. He was the one speaking in the calm and proper voice. Seeing him caused something <br />
in Kryi' to stir.<br />
<br />
The one in the middle... Jake's memories screamed to the surface... it was Tommy... only <br />
now sporting fox ears and a tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;It would appear,&quot; Said the vulcan chained to the wall, &quot;That your spiritual presence is <br />
being treated as a new idea to this mind or spiritual scape, whichever it might be. And like <br />
any new idea introduced to a mind for the first time, it is attempting to... assimilate you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kryi's eyes widened as she turned around and fired the phaser rifle that had been her <br />
plush toy at the borg drone right behind her. It quivered and fell over backwards, it then <br />
dissolved into green light. <br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive my poor choice of words.&quot; Apologized the vulcan. <br />
<br />
Kryi' looked at the weapon, tossed it aside like a dead thing, and picked up her toy again. <br />
<br />
Kryi' looked at the rude man, &quot;The Id, or as Sigmund Freud original put it 'The It?' &quot; She <br />
looked at the human man chained in the center with fox ears, &quot;The Ego? Or rather, The I?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And that would logically make me the Super-Ego or 'Over-I' as was the original <br />
translation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake didn't think Tommy was into that sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is not. But but it was mentioned on a fansite when trying to figure out the relationship <br />
between the Borg Queen and the collective.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kryei slowly turned in a full circle at everyone in the living room, now seeing the grassy <br />
estate through one window, an endless star scape through another, and an endless desert <br />
through a third window. There was also a locked closet door labeled 'Subconscious' that <br />
something occasionally kept trying to bang out of. <br />
<br />
&quot;The technically correct term is unconscious mind.&quot; Kryi' said remembering more of Jake's <br />
memories. The closet sign refused to be altered. <br />
<br />
Wasn't there something important she was supposed to be doing? Something very <br />
important? Something to help a very dear friend of her mommy and daddy? What was it <br />
again?<br />
<br />
'Be careful T', sometimes you will be forced to enter a living human's mind or soul, and <br />
remember while there you're on THERE territory and you have to play by their rules. But <br />
the most dangerous part is that SINCE you're in effective their reality, you're going to find <br />
yourself pushed and pulled into something to FIT that shape... you need to remember to <br />
hold onto at least the core of yourself or you'll LOSE yourself.' <br />
<br />
Kyriel gasped and dropped the stuff toy. She remembered Michael's basic warnings and <br />
instructions for when T' had chosen to be an Angel to walk among humans... 'Have to hold <br />
onto the core of myself... have to hold onto the core of myself.' <br />
<br />
She looked at all those present. 'The It, The I, The Over I.  Tamthis, the Wolf Beast King. <br />
The Wolf Beast Queen. Queen Tammia. Lady Tammia. And Tammia...'<br />
<br />
Kyriel looked at the three aspects of Tommy's mind behind Tamthis...'Only the Vulcan <br />
looks completely unaffected.' <br />
<br />
She also realized between her and the Id, Ego, and Super Ego, was Tamthis and the Wolf <br />
Beasts... Her little girl body shook. She shook her head. 'Hold onto the core of yourself <br />
Kyriel. Remember, you are Kyriel!' <br />
<br />
Queen Tammia looked at this with amusement. Lady Tammia in curiosity and a strange <br />
concern. Tammie, just wanted to see what fun and games were about to begin. <br />
<br />
'Remember T', no matter what form you're put into inside someone else's mind scape, no <br />
matter what role your made to play, as long as you're able to remember what you need to <br />
do, you can still win.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Uncle Mike, I'll remember.&quot; Kyriel said.</p>
