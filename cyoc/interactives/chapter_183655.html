<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lynda opened the door a bit too fast while Tim was thinking about his job interview. The door hit Tim and suddenly the watch activated and he was in a different location. He recognized this office he was in as the one in which he had had his primary interview. He must’ve swapped roles with prospective boss!<br />
<br />
Looking around at all of the pictures in the office, Tim noticed that his face had replaced every instance of his boss’s face. He unbuckled belt, unzipped his dress pants and relieved to find pubic hair on his body once more. He also noticed that this man, Mr. Tucker wore white briefs. That’s a little old fashioned, thought Tim.<br />
<br />
“Wait if I’m in Mr. Tucker’s life, that means that he’s my— Tim’s new wife!” Exclaimed Tim.<br />
<br />
He had to think fast. He told his secretary to cancel the interview with Tim and tell the man that he had gotten the job. Once she had made that quick phone call, and Tim was sure that it was over he thought about his original role and the watch activated. His wife’s body would now be in the role of Mr. Tucker, and Tim would be in his original role.<br />
<br />
Tim looked outside and saw his wife’s car pull in. He went out to greet her. She got out of her car in the body of Mr. Tucker, and thinking nothing of that fact. Mr. Tucker was a fat but muscular Italian man. His curvy body was spilling out of the active wear which Tim’s wife had worn to the gym. There was a particularly large bulge at the crotch.<br />
<br />
Tim’s wife, Heather, had never been openly homophobic, but she made negative comments about feminine men and the idea of same gender attraction. This had caused Tim not to come out to his wife as bisexual. Now he could have sex with his wife and see what it’s like to be with a man’s body. She wouldn’t even know that Tim was thinking of it as gay sex, because she still thought of herself as a woman, as did everyone else except for Tim.<br />
<br />
“Hi babe,” Heather kissed Tim, tickling him with her beard and mustache.<br />
<br />
“Hi sexy,” Tim said, rubbing her bald head. He could hardly believe his luck. The sexy man that had given him his primary interview the other day was now his wife! Only his body of course, but Tim wasn’t too interested in Mr. Tucker’s personality.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go to the bedroom, I’ve been so horny for the last hour for some reason,” said Heather, who was chubbing up in her athletic pants. His wife’s first boner. She must’ve now had Mr. Tucker’s libido because she normally never wanted to have sex.<br />
<br />
The two went inside their house and went up to the bedroom. The two stripped down. Tim’s body was slender and tall(6’0”), without much muscle, fat, or body hair. His hair was dirty blonde and spiked up in the front, 90s style. His eyes were blue and his face had short stubble. His dick was average, 3.5in flaccid, and 6in hard.<br />
<br />
His wife’s new body was 230lbs of man. Since his wife only shaved her lower body, her new body had a dense forest of hair everywhere but below the belt, which was perfectly smooth. It made her eight inch boner look ever bigger having no pubes. Her new eyes were brown, her facial hair grey, and her body hair black, and grey in areas.<br />
<br />
“Eat my ass baby,” said heather, turning around and spreading her man cheeks, revealing a beautiful hole.<br />
<br />
Tim did as was requested, having the time of his life. He hungrily ate Mr. Tucker’s ass, and jerked the huge dick on the other side of his wife’s body. He ate her for a good half an hour as she moaned for more.<br />
<br />
Heather got on the bed and on her back, lifting her muscular and smooth legs up, showing off her primed man-hole. Tim needed no further prompting, he lubed up his cock and his wife’s ass. Penetrating her was surprisingly easy. Probably because she wanted it so bad.<br />
<br />
“So this is what fucking an ass is like,” thought Tim. His wife had never let him do that. He guessed that with her new body it seemed the most obvious path.<br />
<br />
The two fucked for a good hour, and Tim shot his load while making out with Heather and thinking about how hot it was that she had no idea that she was in a man’s body. Heather also busted a huge nut while her husband was in her.<br />
<br />
The two showered together, ate dinner and watched some tv before going to bed. Tim asked his wife to be the big spoon. He wanted to feel her huge cock pressed against him as he slept. She agreed and it was heavenly.</p>
