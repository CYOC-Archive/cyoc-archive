<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Sierra got home her mom forced her to strip down to her underwear so she could make sure all the hair had been removed. Pleased with the result and not at all concerned with her daughters distress Donna dismissed Sierra with a wave of her hand and went to prepare dinner.<br />
Sierra ran upstairs almost in tears, but managed a half smile as she saw her sister Blair looking at her out of her bedroom door.<br />
Once back in her room Sierra stood before the ornate full length mirror. She ran her hands over her smooth body, feeling her calves, her thighs. Cupping her large breasts before moving down to her bald pussy. Her skin was still a little raw from the treatment earlier in the day.<br />
Her eyes alighted on the bulge in her coat pocket. Eagerly she removed the bottle and pulled out the cork, careful not to spill any of the precious liquid. She put three drops into the half full glass of water left by her bedside from the night before. Then she went to her bathroom to retrieve another glass, stopping at the sink to add a little water. She added two drops to this glass but then, after a short pause for thought, she added a third.<br />
Sierra dressed for dinner, all the time her eyes were on the two glasses. She remembered Circe describing the potion, it&#39;s effects. How they were permanent, and if someone drank to much they could start to become beasts. Strangely the thought of being a hairy beast with fangs and claws was exciting Sierra, but could she really do that to her mom?<br />
Sierra downed one of the glasses in a single gulp and took the other down to dinner.<br />
<br />
Two hours later, with a full belly, Sierra stood again before her mirror. All through the meal with her family she had been running her fingers over her arms and legs, hoping to feel her beautiful hairs starting to regrow. No one had commented, and she had barely partaken in any of the conversation around the table. But her mother scolding Blair for some minor incident had made up her mind what to do with the other glass. After dinner she had cleared away the dishes and offered to make coffee. Sierra had added the second glass of water to the boiling kettle, and was satisfied when she saw her mom drink two cups. She was slightly worried when Blair had  taken cup too, but that couldn&#39;t be helped now. Disappointed at the lack of changes on her own body, Sierra crawled into bed and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
As the moon arose and lit up the night sky Sierra began to dream. She&#39;d had erotic dreams before, but nothing like this. She was running through a forest, first on two legs, then four, then back to two. As she ran she became aware of other people hidden in the darkness of the trees. They reached out to her and their fingers brushed her naked body as she ran past. More hands touched her and she slowed her run, naked men and women surrounding her, feral lust in their eyes. Hands groped all over her body and she noticed that the other people were not people at all, but mixtures of man and beast. A man growled showing wolf like teeth, while a women reached out, her arms shaggy with dark fur and her fingers tipped with dark claws. Another woman stood  directly in her path, coarse grey hairs sprouting between her heavy breasts and forming a shaggy coat down her lithe belly until they reached her thick pubes. The woman reached out and pulled Sierra into a kiss. As Sierra was enjoyiong the sensation of the womans wiry hair rubbing over her own taut stomach, other hands reached out and grabbed at her shoulders, her ass, her breasts. Some of the hands smooth, other coarse with hair. She felt nails and claws dragged across her flesh. Tongues licked the side of her face. All of a sudden she was laying down on the mossy floor of the forest, being pleasured over and over...<br />
<br />
Sierra played with herself in her sleep. Her own hands performing the actions of those in her dreams, squeezing her breasts. Two fingers sliding in and out of her wet, aching pussy. As Sierra pleasured herself the changes she&#39;d been hoping for ever since seeing Meadow&#39;s magical brush finally began to appear. Thick red hair sprouted all over her body. It began on her face, her eyebrows becoming scarlet bushes that almost met in the middle. The hair on her head grew even longer, but also wild, pushing out in all directions. It continued to grow down the side of her face and the back of her neck, the beginnings of a beautiful red mane. Her breasts remained hair free, but wiry red hairs sprouted up around her belly button, marching downwards to form a magnificent treasure trail. Her pussy was almost completely hidden behind a thick cavewoman bush that continued right down her thighs, thinning at the knee before thickly covering her lower legs.  Her feet also remained smooth, but her pits exploded with long luxurious hairs that continued to grow thinly around to her upper arms and then longer and thicker down the backs of her forearms to her wrists. But those weren&#39;t the only changes. As Sierra continued to writhe in pleasure the muscles in her arms and legs gained a little definition and her belly grew taut with the beginning of a six pack. Her hands clutching at her sheets started to leave little tears as her nails grew ever so slightly and sharpened at the tips. Not really claws, but not fully human either. Finally her lower set of canines pushed upwards a little and formed points. Not quite fangs, but enough to give her face a slight feral cast. As the changes reached their peak Sierra finally orgasmed, her body thrashing and trembling before settling once more into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
Hours later Sierra was awakened by twin screams coming from her mother&#39;s and sister&#39;s rooms.</p>
