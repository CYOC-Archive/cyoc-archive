<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madame' and Stven walk slowly from the stage as I creep between the benches. Stven argued about the ruthless change done to a man who had no contempt. It was the greed of money for which the man stand's now a buck goat awaiting sale. This strange happening seems to far from the truth to be real, and for that reason I continue to poke my nose into this affair.<br />
<br />
The anguished burbled whines and bleated screams continue to echo the theater as the human thoughts strain to make communication to a world gone so very wrong. As then the witch and her nephew close the door to her changing room I make my way up and over the stage.<br />
<br />
The huge black ram's bleating slows as he see's someone he'd known coming toward him. &quot;Easy buddy! Help is on the way!&quot; I call to him in a soft voice.<br />
<br />
At last I stand along side the aside his pen's fence. The hearty fellow comes close and stands next to me sniffing me as a goat might. My hand reaches out to instinctively pet an animal and scratch his floppy ears. &quot;Easy, we got to get you out of here! That Witch and her nephew will come to terms once you are not in the clutches. I will help you escape and try to work out a plan for the Madame' to change you back to human form.&quot; <br />
<br />
The goat seemed to be listening, as I unlatched his gate he began to bleat wildly. As my hand reached to try and calm him less we be caught a hand touched my shoulder.<br />
<br />
Scared, I turned to see Steven standing behind me. &quot;Hey stupid, if the ole' girl see's you doing what your planning she will have two goats for sale!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I know him he's a friend of mine! I can't just walk away and say ho hum he's a goat now! If that ole' Witch Madame' Illusia wants to sell goats, or animals to make her living she need not make them out of nice people, like him!&quot; I argued back and pointed to my friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steven, I hear voices, what's on the prod?&quot; calls the Madame'<br />
<br />
Steven looks a mean look at me and answers Madame', &quot;Nothing Auntie' I was talking with one of the Park's stage repairmen. He stopped over about the spot light not working all that well!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, all right but make it quick I want to contact the Pleasure Island Farms about our big buck!&quot; the Madame' states her plans.<br />
<br />
Steven looks back at me, &quot;She's not stupid, if you take from her she will have her spirits find both him and you and the Devil only knows what she might turn you into. Now leave and put him out of your mind, he is a goat and over the next few days the instincts of beastial form will wipe away all human memories and thoughts. A big billy goat he is an will remain till she get's another money making idea about him again.&quot;<br />
<br />
A soft and in pained mind bleats at us with the last of his understanding seeping away. The animal starts walking in circles as a beast does when uncertain about what it's doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, he's forgeting the animal mind is taking over! Just think, had you taken him he'd be a goat in mind and body before you got out of the Park. Then a security guard or a Coachman would catch you and return the goat. The Madame' would drop charges and have you delivered here to meet the fate she would choose. You like other's before you have mettled in her business and now give of themselves in humping females or being milked! Now get out of here!&quot; Steven threatens and I listen well this time.<br />
<br />
As Steven walks to lock the rear door to the theater I made a foolish mistake. Walking up to the Madame's dressing room I knocked at the door. The grumbling sounds of the old woman getting up as to answer the knock.<br />
<br />
The door opens quickly and the pudgy form of a woman half dressed stands before me eye to eye. &quot;Yes, and who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, I'm Kevin Rooste and that black goat over there was two hours ago my best friend!&quot;<br />
<br />
An angered look comes over her face as she looks past me to the small pen where her victim stands. The running feet of Steven coming closer turns her gaze and then back eye to eye with me. &quot;So your best of friends aye!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I know what your probably thinking but please hear me first. He did not earn the life of being a goat! Every person has a fantasy, some nice, some erotic, and some just plain evil. Since he had done nothing to you or your nephew I wish to buy him from you with a condition.&quot; I bargined.<br />
<br />
A smile came over the old woman's face, &quot;Yes sonny go on you interest me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How much did you expect to gain from the sale of him to that breeding farm?&quot; I asked in a business sort of way.<br />
<br />
&quot;$700. dollars silver!&quot; the Madame replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I will pay you $700. dollars in silver for him and add to that another $7,700. dollars as a bonus if you let him stay a big buck of a goat for one full year. Then at the end on the year he is to return to himself as he was here two hours ago, except he will have all the memories of his year as the erotic goat! On his transformation back to himself I will pay you a payment of $4,200. now what say you to that?&quot; I said standing with arms folded and looking her in the eye.<br />
<br />
You could see the mighty dollar figures running totals in her head as she looked off to Steven standing nearby. &quot;I agree, but with one provise'o, if he after one year wishes to remain a big billy goat and mount nanny goats as his life's work, then he should remain a goat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No deal there he must, I repeat must be returned to a human as he was and that's my deal!&quot; I demanded as my heel stomped the wooden floor board which echoed the theater.<br />
<br />
The Madame' smiled and said, &quot; Alright I accept, come inside and we shall write out this contract and seal the bargin.&quot; <br />
<br />
As I walked inside and she shut Steven outside the door she turned to me and scowled. &quot;You will pay me tomorrow, yes? If you make a fool of Madame' Illusia your friend's lifestyle will be far better than yours!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me!&quot; As soon as I said it she smiled and raised her hands high in the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh young man trust is a two way street! I will trust you but only with the mark of things to happen if you make me the fool.&quot; She then began to walk about me in a circle and mumble those terrible words she had damned my friend to a life of beastial service.<br />
<br />
I watched in horror as a small cloud of blackness swirled around my hips and legs.<br />
<br />
Then she stopped suddenly, her arms went to her sides and she again smiled. &quot;Now we can deal and trust will be mutual! Look at yourself well from the waist down behind the screen there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The horror of the blacken mist made me jump behind the screen and drop my pants. There I stood, my belly and legs covered in a thickcoat of dark colored bristles. My heels looked more like hocks as feet and cloven hooves attached made me realize I was part hog now!<br />
A prick of pain made me turn to see my new pig's tail jut out above my ass and worst of all two softball size testicles hung out behind too. My groin now sported a sheath of a large boar and with little doubt the penis of such inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's this!&quot; I yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust young man, trust! If the silver be not here tomorrow then you shall be looking for a sty and a sow the next morning!&quot; she said with a grin. &quot;Oh and try not keep your self virgin as if you dip into swine lust and tonight or tomorrow would mount a sow the change shall continue till I recieve an additional payment, or else!&quot;<br />
<br />
The contract was written with great difficulty as one hand was always jammed down into my pants to rub the sensual sheath below.</p>
