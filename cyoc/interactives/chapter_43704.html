<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trevor was a fourteen year old boy. He was well aware that many would consider him a bit of a geek. He had to admit that he was short even for his age and rather scrawny. He also wore glasses and had a nervous disposition. A flaw not helped by that fact that a certain sixteen year old bully, Dave Laury, was frequently stealing his lunch money and had only that very morning flushed his head down another toilet.<br />
Dave was an asshole. Taller and overall bigger than Trevor, he enjoyed pushing him around. He also thought he was a stud, chatting up girls relentlessly. It was a source of annoyance to Trevor that Dave got plenty of the hot sixteen year old babes in his year to date him.<br />
The medallion spirit had only recently started to get involved in human affairs for the positive, but was beginning to like it. With the magic powers at its command it could foresee the actions of Dave that would, after several more years of abuse, lead to Trevor being injured beyond recovery and left in a wheelchair.<br />
The spirit knew this was not only unjust, but would prevent Trevor from accomplishing his aspirations to become a world-renowned doctor. Something had to be done, so later that night the spirit floated into his room and gave Trevor a dream.<br />
Trevor awoke feeling odd. He had a very lucid dream, being visited by a vast floating and swirling cloud that told him his voice now had the power to make things come true. The only control was a phrase he needed to use before the power altered reality. &quot;I believe you will find...&quot;.<br />
Trevor thought no more about it until he reached the bus stop and found that he had not enough money left from the last day, to pay for the journey today.<br />
'Sorry kid, you've not got enough change.'<br />
'I believe you will find i do'. Said Trevor, not really thinking it would work.<br />
'Oh ye...sorry kid. Get on.'<br />
Odd! Surely that couldn't be right? He decided to maybe do another test. He wasn't a credulous person but he was always willing to believe the world had a little magic left.<br />
He really couldn't decide how best to test such a thing, so he had to take a wild stab at something that would be amusing and exciting.<br />
After a time he came to a conclusion and approached Louise, a very attractive blonde sixteen year old girl in Dave's year. She was wearing a form-fitting tanktop and a pair of spray on denim shorts. He wandered over to her, taking a deep breath just before saying. 'I see you are not wearing a bra today, Louise.'<br />
The girl spun around, looked utterly furious. 'What the hell are you saying, you little sleaze? Of course i am!'<br />
She moved to slap him and he stumbled back a bit. 'I believe you will find that you are not wearing a bra today, Louise.'<br />
She stopped for a second, looking mildly confused and then looked down without lowering her raised hand that was ready to slap him. Sure enough, she noticed with horror that her white tanktop was sporting two dark blotches where here nipples were visible through the flimsy material.<br />
'Oh my god!' She screamed and ran away from the bus stop to her home, persumably to get a bra.<br />
Trevor was utterly beside himself with joy. He, somehow, was now a master of reality. He had a good few ideas where to start.<br />
<br />
Trevor managed to round up several of his friends who were also geeks. Liam and Giles were sometimes victims of Dave as well and would be interested to see what was going to unfold. They hadn't believed him until he had convinced Mr Slater that he was actually needing to rush home and bake a cake then go out into the garden and strip naked, before sitting on the cake for an hour.<br />
Following his departure, the two other boys were eager to see what was going to transpire. They had decided that the revenge should take the form of a reminder to Dave of the people he had hurt and why.<br />
Dave was over chatting to a girl in the lunch hall and she was giggling away. It took a little effort to get close and listen in but they were not surprised to hear it was going well. <br />
'I wish he wasn't so good with girls.' Said Liam, frowning.<br />
'I think we can arrange that.' Trevor stated confidently. 'Do you guys remember that kid who moved away? Tyler something?'<br />
'The one with the stutter?'<br />
'That's the one. What letters did he find hard to say again?'<br />
'I think it was P and S.'<br />
'I remember how Dave mercilessly took the piss out of him. I wonder how Dave would take the piss when we can't even say piss?' Trevor chuckled at his own wit. 'I believe you will find that Dave is moving from these two girls to chat up Patricia and Susan. I believe you will find that Dave now has the same problem Tyler did with saying P and S.'<br />
The three slowly followed Dave as he broke off conversation with the girls he was working at getting with, then wandered over to Patricia and Susan. They waited as he wandered over. Rolling up the sleeves of his green rugby shirt he revealed his muscular arms and smiled at them. 'Hi babes-s-s.' He stopped for a second and then continued. 'What do they call you?' <br />
The girls looked at him seemingly not knowing who he was. They probably didn't as they were new to the school and were both wearing some very attractive halter tops and minis, Patricia in fetching purple and Susan in a light blue.<br />
'I am Patricia and this is Susan.'<br />
'Hi there P-p-p-p-.....p-p-p-p-atricia.' Dave looked stunned as the two girls glanced at each other and started to smirk. Dave bravely pushed on, shaking his head and willing this odd slip of his tongue to get lost. 'Hi S-s-s-s-s-s-s-s...s-s-s-s-s-s......sssssssss u s-s-s-s...'<br />
The girls burst out laughing. 'No offence, man, but we don't have all day. Laters l-l-l-l-oser.' She did the l sign and mocked him with a fake stutter as they walked off.<br />
The three boys were in hysterics, hardly notcing as Dave spotted them and stalked over. He looked ready to pound them all into squashed geek, but Trevor managed to sober enough from his laughing enough to say. 'Hang on there, Dave. I believe you will find you are pissing yourself.'<br />
Daves face fell and he raced out of the room, clutching his shorts as a dark stain started to appear on the white fabric.<br />
Once the boys had calmed down a little, Trevor looked at his two companions smugly. 'I believe you will find that whatever girl Dave talks to from now on, he will stutter at least two letters in her name but have to keep using it.'<br />
'Shot down!' Yelled Giles.<br />
<br />
Dave was on the war path the next day. All throughout school the three avoided him, ready for the big confrontation that Trevor had magically stated would happen. Somehow, all would find themselves in the locker rooms after school. And that is where Dave would get his comeuppance. The three could hardly wait.<br />
When the time came around, the three had effortlessly sneaked into the locker rooms and grabbed some spare keys. They saw Dave wandering around outside and whistled at him, once they were sure all others had gone. He raced towards them and they fled into the showers. He thought he had cornered them.<br />
He was dressed in his usual rugby kit, green top with the sleeves rolled up and some white shorts with blue and yellow socks and black rugby boots. He looked quite intimidating but the boys were not scared any more.<br />
'Hi Dave. I am glad you came. I think you've been nasty enough to a lot of people in the school, not just us. I think it's about time it stopped. Don't you?'<br />
'I am gonna break your scrawny neck!' Dave screamed and ran forward.<br />
'I believe you will find that you can't actually move.'<br />
Lo and behold, Dave froze in place. Still cursing and yelling at them.<br />
'Now, where were we? Can you remind me of some of the crimes Dave has done Liam?'<br />
Liam thought for a moment. 'How about that time he beat up Chris because he couldn't play football?'<br />
'Oh yes! Dave! Shame on you. I believe you will find that you cannot play football either, you don't know any of the rules and if you try to kick the ball you will always fall over.' Trevor took the ball that Giles had went and got from the sports room and rolled it at Dave. 'I believe you will find you can move again but only to have a go at kicking this ball'<br />
Dave fell flat on his ass after a terrible attempt. Which brought a little chuckle from all three.<br />
'What is next? This time, Giles'<br />
'I remember in these very showers being laughed at by Dave. You too. For being too short and skinny.'<br />
'Nasty, very nasty. E	specially considering! I believe you will find that Dave is shorter and skinnier than any of us.'<br />
Dave swore loudly at them but he was stuck on the ground. His shorts and green rugby top looked the same but instead of being taken from the adult section he now remembered having to go to the junior section to get them to fit. He was wearing the rugby kit of a thirteen year old. His sleeves were still rolled up but were now folded several times at the end of the sleeve to stay up on his skinny arms. He flexed his right bicep and nearly cried when he saw nothing change on his tiny arm.<br />
'What the fuck have you done to me? Where is my real body?'<br />
'That is your real body. Now. Oh, and while we are at it. Remember little Bobby? The one you got the whole school calling Bobby Baby Dick? I believe you find that he has your good size cock, whilst you have is and your new nickname is Davey Baby Dick.'<br />
'Show us, Dave!' Cackled Liam.<br />
'I believe you will find you have to show us.'<br />
Dave stood up and with a horrified expression pulled his junior size shorts down. His tiny little dick hung a pitiful one inch. A little stub sitting upon a small set of almost hairless balls.<br />
'I believe you will find that you are getting an erection and that, sadly, it only grows another inch when heard.' Trevor grinned.<br />
Dave's new cock twitched and grew up within two seconds. It stood a mere two inches tall and almost an inch of this was the purple helmet, with the shaft an inch itself.<br />
'Poor Dave, that really is small! With your stuttering and that little thing, plus your totally geeky body, you will find it hard to get dates. Oh ye! This probably will not help but...I believe you will find that upon seeing any bare boobs you will immediately get a hardon and cum within five seconds.'<br />
'Nnnnnoooo!' <br />
'Don't worry. It's not all bad. I believe you will find that your new favourite hobby of nudism is very good for you. I believe you will find that every weekend you head off to the nearest nudist beach or resort and enjoy full nudity. Unfortunately that means plenty of awkward incidents when you see topless women. But not to worry! You outwardly enjoy nudism but of course, inwardly you know, everyone is laughing at your tiny, tiny dick.'<br />
'Have a nice life, Dave!' Chirped Liam as they all started to leave. As he passed the now smaller boy he pulled something from his back pocket. It was a page three model, topless and smiling.<br />
Dave grunted as he saw her, his limp one incher twitching to life, growing to two and spraying a tiny little spurt of cum as he sobbed.<br />
Trevor looked behind him and laughed. 'You might want to clean yourself up, Dave. I believe you will find that you are walking home nude today past the catholic girls school.'</p>
