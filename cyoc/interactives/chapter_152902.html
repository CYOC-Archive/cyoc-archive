<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So our choose is to become either Merpeople or Die?” inquired Cindy as Damon nodded his head and looked at his three friends, the three of them had been best friends for years. He and Jon since third grade with what some people they know joking called the “merger” when Cindy and Sarah who had been best friends since pre-school joined them to form a tight four group friends. No one was surprised when Cindy and Jon started dating or when he and Sarah started dating as well. They would only ask if they would have joint weddings when the time came. Yes they all had other friends but the four of them where super tight. <br />
“Not really much of a choose.” Confirmed Jon as he looked toward Damon’s mermaid mother and back at his jeep judging if he could get away or get at the mermaid. His mother must have noticed this and with one powerful kick she sprinted to be between them and the beach. <br />
“So leave our family, our lives or die?” inquired Cindy again as she let out a heavy sigh before looking at her boyfriend and her best friend. Jon sighed as well and nodded his head. “I would rather not die.”<br />
 “Me too.” stated Jon “Damn, we shouldn’t have pulled over to see why you didn’t make it to swim practice.”<br />
“So we have two that will change, what about you Sarah?” inquired his mother<br />
“Can I have a moment?” inquired Sarah still thinking, she had more issues to deal with, her boyfriend was now a mermaid on top of the choice of life or death.<br />
“Certainly we will start with Cindy and Jon, so do you wish to stay the same genders or change?” inquired his mother<br />
“I believe we will stay the same.” Stated Jon as Cindy nodded her head.<br />
“Very well.” Stated his mother “You will have to remove your cloths, merpeople don’t wear cloths and they will only get in the way.”<br />
“What they don’t wear even sea shell tops?” inquired Cindy as his mother looked down to her own bare chest. “I’ll take that as a no.”<br />
Slowly, almost painfully slowly Cindy and Jon began to undress, Cindy blushed a bit at being nude infront of Damon, she and Jon had slept together a few times so she wasn’t blushing about him and she and Sarah had been changing in front of each other for years in the locker room before and after swim class. However Damon hardly took notice of her nudes he was still coming to grips that he now had a pair of breast of his own. Jon was slightly faster but that may be because the water was high enough to cover his manhood. <br />
“Please stand together.” Ordered his mother as his two friends moved to stand together, Sarah had yet to say a word as the water around her friends began to glow as Damon’s mother began to sing again. Then with a splash both of them fell backward away from the shore. Reacting on instincts Damon went under the water only to see that like him both of his friends eyes where wide and had a panic look on their faces.<br />
“Don’t worry, your make it.” Reassured Damon as Jon and Cindy both turned and looked at each other in the eyes as the changes began. None of them where changing genders but still there where changes, he saw slits open up along the sides of their necks as gills came in. When he saw that he moved his own hand up to his neck and felt his own gills. Then he noticed that the blonde hair of Cindy seamed to change slightly turning from a sort of dirty blonde into a pure golden blonde, webbing grew between her fingers which themselves where also golden. Jon’s changes where about the same as his dark hair turned into an almost pitch black as webbing grew around his fingers, which where a blackish blue color. <br />
The real changes happened on both of their legs, their legs where pulled together and merged into a single limb. Even as this happened their legs seamed to elongated by a foot or two as their feet turned to the side and elongated as well. For a brief moment their news tails where perfectly formed only fleshed colored and then scales began to grow in. First in ones and twos and then whole groups. A deep bright purple mostly for Cindy with lots of yellow highlights while an almost blackish navy with royal blue highlights formed on Jon’s legs. And like that it was done. <br />
Damon watched as Jon rolled over and looked at Cindy, his eyes locked on her eyes not looking at what he or she had become. He gently placed a hand on the other side of her face.<br />
“You alright?” inquired Jon<br />
“I think so, this just feels so weird.” Stated Cindy as she looked at him. “So we are merpeople now.”<br />
“I guess we are.” Confirmed Jon as he looked down at Cindy and then himself. “You are the most beautiful mermaid in the sea.”<br />
“And you are the most handsome merman.” Added Cindy to him as the two of them kissed underwater. With that Damon lifted his head up to find Sarah had finally made her up her mind.</p>
