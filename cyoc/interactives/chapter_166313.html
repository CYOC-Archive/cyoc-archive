<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Me.&quot; Paul said, standing on top of his chair to gain some height and at least an appearance of dignity. &quot;I am so sick of being a stupid little girl. I want my age back, I want my dignity back, and I want my weenie back!&quot; He growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weenie?&quot; Rick snickered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up! This stupid camera won&#39;t let me curse! I just want to be me again, but even if I don&#39;t get fully back I&#39;ll take being older at least.&quot; He retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait Honey, would you mind if I go first?&quot; Olivia asked. &quot;This thing is starting to grow again and it feels... weird.&quot; She said, adjusting it awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s no reason we can&#39;t do both of you at the same time.&quot; Emily suggested. &quot;Would you like to go together?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely.&quot; Olivia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as I&#39;m back ASAP, I&#39;m down for anything.&quot; Paul agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, why don&#39;t we just all go at once?&quot; Rick suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, remember this thing changes reality. If we all got a bad change, then we&#39;d be screwed. Plus, at least you can&#39;t change if Mom is going to change since if she becomes a kid we&#39;d need you to stay in charge.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Rick sadly agreed. &quot;If Olivia becomes a baby or something then I&#39;m the only adult who&#39;s aware.&quot; He grumbled, lifting and then dropping one of his boobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s Mrs. Smith to you kid.&quot; Paul grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is a baby a possibility?&quot; Olivia whispered to Paul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, look at me!&quot; Paul sarcastically curtsied. Olivia giggled and lifted an annoyed Paul off the chair and onto the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I guess we&#39;re ready.&quot; Olivia announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... good luck.&quot; Emily said quietly. <br />
<br />
Rick sat down, hoping they&#39;d get close enough so he could try next. Emily braced herself, worried about a possible bad change which would cause her parents to further freak out. She didn&#39;t even want to think about how grounded she might be after all of this was said and done. She aimed, and then took the picture.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
Paul blinked a few times, surprised by just how bright the camera&#39;s flash was. He hadn&#39;t actually transformed while aware, so he wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. He soon realized that he could not move. Try as he might, he found himself unable to budge at all. He could still see, but his sight was warped... almost like everything was stretched awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m young again!&quot; He heard a soft voice from behind him. &quot;But, I&#39;m still a boy!&quot; The child cried out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Olivia? Is that you?&quot; He wanted to yell, but also found he couldn&#39;t talk.<br />
<br />
Olivia gasped, and suddenly Paul found himself being stared at by a little boy, no older than seven, but was towering over him. He tried to move, but couldn&#39;t. He examined the boy and realized it was definitely Olivia, as she even looked like  younger version of her manly counterpart. <br />
<br />
Olivia held out her finger, slowly moving it towards Paul. Paul wanted to ask what she was doing, but could only watch as she poked him. Her finger went further than he thought, pushing deep into his body. What the hell was he? As soon as she moved her hand away, Paul felt his insides surge back towards where she poked him, with a scratching sound filling his head.<br />
<br />
He felt as if he drank too much water and his insides were slushing around before he finally middled out again. He saw Rick and Emily walk over, both looking as equally concerned as Olivia looked. Finally, Emily spoke up.<br />
&quot;Shit, I knew it was a possibility, but I hoped we wouldn&#39;t get it.&quot; She sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?! That can&#39;t be Paul!&quot; Olivia pointed at him. &quot;He&#39;s... he&#39;s a bean bag chair?&quot; She asked confused.<br />
<br />
Paul would&#39;ve gasped if he had a mouth. He wanted to scream to undo it immediately, but he couldn&#39;t even move. Rick watched the sack with slight humor. It was just a big, yellow bean bag. The color was slightly reminiscent of Paul&#39;s hair color, but beyond that most would just mistake it as any old crappy seat a kid would keep in the corner of their room. &quot;Serves him right for being a dick to me.&quot; Rick thought with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that&#39;s Dad.&quot; Emily sighed. &quot;Inanimate is a possible option, but I was hoping we&#39;d get lucky and get you guys close to back.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well that didn&#39;t happen.&quot; Olivia pouted. &quot;Just hurry up and... Rick, when did you change?&quot; Olivia suddenly asked.<br />
<br />
Emily turned to face him while Rick looked down, equally surprised. He was dressed like a typical soccer mom. He had an oversized, girly sweatshirt on which hung loosely off his large breasts, and a scarf which warmed his neck. He was wearing shades, hooped earrings, and his curly red hair was tied in a tight bun. He looked down and saw sneakers and slightly ripped jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh... that&#39;s weird.&quot; Rick scratched his head, only to accidentally scratch himself with his long nails. &quot;Ow...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s why Mom.&quot; Emily realized. &quot;Look at what you&#39;re wearing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Olivia looked down to see she was dressed in a soccer outfit. It was a white shirt with blue stripes, light blue shorts and fleets to match. She ran over to a mirror and saw her dark black hair was shorter than ever, combed nicely to the side. Even though she was still a boy, her younger age made her look surprisingly similar to how she actually looked decades ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, I look so precious!&quot; She giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess reality just adjusted is all.&quot; Emily speculated. She looked over back at her father and noticed a cooler, two beach chairs and an umbrella sitting on the table next to a soccer ball. &quot;Ah, I guess you&#39;re on a local soccer team Mom.&quot; Emily chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I never figured cute old me would&#39;ve been the sporty type if I was born a boy.&quot; Olivia laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be the MILF type if I was a... wooooman!&quot; Rick joked, making his voice extra breathy on the last word. The three laughed at the situation, finally having a little rest after the stress of having their memories stripped and then reapplied.<br />
<br />
Paul, meanwhile, was furious. They had completely forgotten about him! He tried to scream at them to remind them that he took priority over fashion changes, but he still couldn&#39;t make a peep. After all, he was just an object. The feeling of that fact hit Paul strongly in that moment. He didn&#39;t have a body anymore, but if he did it would have had chills. <br />
&quot;Wow, I&#39;m just an item.&quot; Paul realized. &quot;That&#39;s... crazy.&quot; He thought. &quot;Never thought I&#39;d miss being a little girl.&quot; He joked to himself.<br />
<br />
His thoughts were soon interrupted, however, and his intrigue soon turned to panic. He could hear a car park outside. While they were busy yapping, someone was about to interrupt, and Paul did NOT want to stay like that longer than he had to. He tried to roll, shake, bounce, do anything but the bean bag just sat there, internally frustrated. He heard footsteps approach the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok seriously though.&quot; Emily chilled. &quot;Let&#39;s focus Mom. We don&#39;t want you to stay like-&quot;<br />
<br />
DING DONG<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit.&quot; Emily whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick! Change us back!&quot; Olivia aggressively whispered, pointing at Paula and gesturing at herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t risk it. It could be a worse situation if  that&#39;s your new father or something.&quot; She quickly explained. &quot;Rick, Mom, just play it cool and act like how you look.&quot; She growled, before walking up to the door and opening it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hello Emile! I didn&#39;t know you were coming to watch you brother&#39;s game.&quot; The woman smiled at Emily. <br />
<br />
Emily, meanwhile, was panicked at who was at the door.<br />
&quot;Uhh, yeah, Mrs. McGuire.&quot; She grinned awkwardly. &quot;I was just... in the mood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. McGuire walked in, and Rick&#39;s jaw dropped. It was HIS MOM. What the Hell was she doing here? Were they family now? &quot;No that couldn&#39;t be, She didn&#39;t object to Emily calling her that. Maybe it&#39;s a half sibling thing. Ugh, who am I even married to now? What do I say to her? How do I-&quot; His train of thought went derailing before a snap from his mother brought him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello! Earth to Becca! You okay there girl?&quot; She asked with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Rick was shocked. His mother was usually such a hard ass on him, but she seemed so... bubbly. Nothing like the serious stick in the mud she was with him normally. &quot;I guess that&#39;s the perks of moving from son to gal pal.&quot; He thought with an internal scream.<br />
&quot;Ha, thanks Mo- Jennifer! Jenny, I mean... I&#39;m good.&quot; He smiled, trying to pose the best he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah sure.&quot; Jennifer snickered. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, three kids ran inside, all wearing identical clothes to Olivia. Olivia was overrun and surrounded by boys her age... or at least her current age. They were all joking, talking at once, and one even gave her a slap hard on the back. She wanted to tell them to buzz off, but remembered it wasn&#39;t fair to be rude since they remembered her as their pal. Emily went to help her mother and once she was gone Jennifer leaned in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen Becca, I know what&#39;s wrong.&quot; She said with a whisper. &quot;I get it, Mark&#39;s on a business trip so no sex for another few days is rough right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick could feel his face turning red with each second passed. This was the LAST conversation he wanted to be having. <br />
&quot;H-ha. You got me?&quot; He bluffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Figured. I get it, two boys to look after alone is rough. Thanks again for helping me chaperone the team for my husband. He&#39;s &quot;Mr. Coach Dad and all but let me tell you he needs us ladies to help&quot; She laughed. &quot;How about this, I&#39;ll take your supplies and Oliver, and you can let Emile play a game and you can masturbate for a bit.&quot; She gave a wink. &quot;Meet me there soon though ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick just stood there flabergasted. His mother walked over to the group of boys and yelled &quot;Okay, bring the stuff to the minivan everyone! The game&#39;s starting soon!&quot; Olivia looked to Emily with a help me stare but Emily shrugged. She tried to walk away to Rick to ask him for help with an excuse when Jennifer interrupted with a grip on the arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way mister I need the biggest, strongest man to lift that cooler, got it?&quot; She said with a teasing voice which embarrassed Emily slightly. She found herself obliging her request and soon everything was loaded into the truck and Olivia and her peers were off. Emily walked back inside to find Rick still standing still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick, what the Hell was that? You didn&#39;t even try to help!&quot; She groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, um, sorry, i just had the weirdest talk with my mom...&quot; He said batantly. &quot;I&#39;m also starting to think I was a bad son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now don&#39;t say that.&quot; She responded gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I mean, she&#39;s at least a ton more relaxed if I don&#39;t exist.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll make it up to her when we fix all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit.&quot; Emily gave him a hug, awkwardly backing off when her face met his massive tits. &quot;Eh, sorry babe, this is kinda weird with who we technically are...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I get it.&quot; He laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of getting back though.&quot; Emily said, raising the camera. &quot;Thanks for letting your mom drive off with my mom. I don&#39;t want to bring the camera out in public so we&#39;re gonna have to wait til after her game.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I was distracted by my mom and my weird new relationship.&quot; He chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick, I don&#39;t want to hear it. The other day I was my own mom&#39;s mother and married to my... DAD!&quot; She gasped, spinning in place.<br />
<br />
The bean bag chair that was her father was missing, taken as just part of the supplies into the minivan. Meanwhile, in the trunk of the car, Paul was internally creaming every curse he knew, praying to every deity possible that his family wouldn&#39;t forget him, and vowing he&#39;d burned the damned camera when this was all over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Emily groaned. &quot;We cannot lose track of him Rick, we have to go now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright definitely!&quot; He agreed. They both started to run to the door when Rick spotted that Emily was bringing the camera. &quot;Uh, didn&#39;t you just say it was too dangerous to bring out in public?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it is, but we gotta fix this mess... and I don&#39;t want to lose track of him at any point.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it. We go in, change your dad, change your mom, and then hopefully be able to leave the game with no problems.&quot; He agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; Emily yelled, running to the car.</p>
