<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick was absolutely blown away by the way his body had just spontaneously it seemed changed literally overnight. There was no way in hell he could go back to sleep now. Not when his body was looking and feeling like this. He didn&#39;t even know how old he was now, though his impulse told him that he was at least over 18. A grin began to grow on his face. His hands began to roam. Touching his newly minted tight and toned pectorals, roaming south over his svelte, sexy abdominal area, and then to the cock that seemed longer, more sensitive, and more alluring than anything he&#39;d ever seen.<br />
<br />
He had to...he had to touch himself. But he couldn&#39;t afford to make a sound right now. Not with everyone asleep. So he brought one hand up to his mouth as he gulped, edging closer to pulling his heinously tight boxers clean off his body. His sense of sexuality demanded reprieve from this needy state. <br />
<br />
Just when he got them half off, the back end pulled just half over his voluminous glutes and his cock half visible,  Nick swooned at the sight of it. He was so used to being regarded as the girly one. The unimpressive man. The guy who everyone seemed to think was gay. But now, now Nick felt hot. He gasped into his waiting hand when his uneasy fingers rubbed at the middle point of his manhood.<br />
<br />
<i>Ahh yes...yes...fuck yes!</i> Nick propped himself up on his bed, one leg, twitching and shuddering with the results of his pleasure as it was, stepping up on his bed. Nick had to...get off. And as he went about awkwardly fondling himself, choking down his louder moans, grunts, and gasps, he found himself wistfully wishing he could&#39;ve shared this kind of pleasure with someone else. With Natalie. She was still front and center in his mind.<br />
<br />
Especially in his sexual fantasies. Nick could see himself pushing his newly girthy, longer cock into her pussy. He could feel her breasts under his hands at long last. She would react to his newly toned body, his boyband pretty face, and she&#39;d think he was fucking hot. &quot;Oh...Natalie...&quot; Nick whimpered to himself as he bit his knuckle, trying to avoid the awkward confrontation with his folks over the fact their son had suddenly become so much older.<br />
<br />
But as he was trying to find his rhythm of thrusting into his hand and at the same time rubbing his manhood, Nick could see something going on outside. There were some lights. It looked like a flashlight. Someone was out, walking at this hour. Who...? As much as it pained him - the idea of blueballing himself - Nick grunted as he stuffed his cock away in his boxers. Fuck, but with how horny he was it stung to just ignore his throbbing erection.<br />
<br />
But he licked his lips as he looked out the window and his brief scowl shifted into a wide grin.<br />
<br />
There she was, with her friend Clara, and one of the jocks from school, a smooth-shaven, muscular blond with wavy hair named Greg Jacobsen. Usually, Nick felt smaller than Greg, and intimidated by him. But now it seemed like the scales had shifted. Nick was actually just going by his instinct about an inch or two taller than Greg, and the slim and tight-bodied runningback wasn&#39;t quite as impressive as some of his bigger cohorts.<br />
<br />
Nick knew just going by the atmosphere there seemed to be - they were chatting, taking a while, talking, chuckling - they were probably going somewhere. A---A party. He remembered at school as he headed to class - he heard one of the popular senior guys talking about somewhere out near the river - there was gonna be a party there. <br />
<br />
His hand rested on the window. His mind drifted to thoughts of finally going out with friends. Of escaping the cycle of go to school, come home, study. He could...party. He could have fun. He could...<i>get laid.</i><br />
<br />
Just thinking about that brought Nick traipsing over to his closet, tearing through his clothes for something that would fit him. He found something deep in his closet - bigger pair of black jeans, meant for him to &quot;grow into&quot;. Well, it seemed like he grew into these sooner than his folks might&#39;ve intended. He then looked around for a shirt - and when he pulled on a formerly loose black tank top, it instead fit him more like a showy black belly-shirt made to show off his body.<br />
<br />
And why shouldn&#39;t he show off? He had a body now worth showing!<br />
<br />
Nick pulled on some socks, and then headed out. He found a pair of his dad&#39;s shoes resting by the front door as he snuck downstairs. He made sure that everyone was still asleep, didn&#39;t make much if any noise while moving, and slipped his dad&#39;s shoes on before heading out. They were a reasonable fit - not the best, but not the worst either. The idea of putting on his old shoes was a total nonstarter. He needed to get out there!<br />
<br />
They were just about walking down the street toward the edge, waiting for a light to turn...<br />
<br />
Nick hurried along, rushing out and wincing at the feeling of the night air on his skin. Maybe, he thought to himself, he should try and get some more temperature-conscious clothes. As he tried to keep himself cool and good to go, as to not seem too overeager, he found that they were looking at him. Greg seemed kind of weirded out by the guy approaching them from out of nowhere, but Clara was staring in a different way.<br />
<br />
As he approached, Greg asked, &quot;Dude, are you like, someone&#39;s plus one for the party? I...don&#39;t remember you from around school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Greg, don&#39;t worry about it...&quot; Clara started, and Nick could hear Natalie chuckling a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nick started, &quot;I&#39;m ah...I do like, boyband stuff. Nobody famous yet, we&#39;re just operating out of the garage.&quot; He said it as it seemed the most natural explanation. Not that he could tell that some further changes were coming in as he explained himself. Adjustments to smooth things over - he couldn&#39;t after all tell that everything going on was observed by his peers utilizing the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Nick found himself remembering several songs and covers he&#39;d done, even though he just meant that as a cover story. How weird. Well, maybe there was more going on here. Though he wasn&#39;t exactly concerned as of yet.<br />
<br />
Clara outright squealed with joy at the confirmation, &quot;I think I heard your music once or twice! You are like, so gorgeous! I love that someone invited you to the party!&quot; <br />
<br />
Nick hadn&#39;t exactly been into Clara, but the idea of a fangirl tickled him in just the right spot. He&#39;d wanted to be more than just the plain, effeminate face staring at Natalie. Natalie herself wryly commented, &quot;Okay Clara, you can jump his bones at the party. We gotta get going.&quot; Natalie herself then said something that almost made Nick&#39;s heart pump faster, &quot;...though if you don&#39;t mind me saying, I really get the appeal, pretty boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Clara thinks I&#39;m GORGEOUS!</i> Nick thought as he promptly joined them on the road to their party. He still remembered who he was before these changes, but he could more than appreciate the work they&#39;d done on getting him looking and feeling like this. Maybe he could even try his hand at singing at the party.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t have much experience with that, but there was something now with him. This strange sense of new experience. He could draw on something new, something foreign, that he had grown into so suddenly. The idea of being on stage, of handling a mic, it felt so much more natural than it had any right to be.<br />
<br />
Nick also found himself noting that Greg was staring at him some more.<br />
<br />
He had no idea why that might be, but he figured he needed to focus on the party - and hopefully, having some fun tonight. There was a thrilling sense there of possibly being part of the entertainment tonight. All eyes on him. It made his dick fucking <i>pulse...!</i></p>
