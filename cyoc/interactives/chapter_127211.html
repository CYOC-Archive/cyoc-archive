<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty listened to the loud music coming from his foster brothers room.  He could tell that Dustin was working out in there, trying to get the body he once had back.  Ty hadn&#39;t known what he was doing when he had wished Dustin down to his 13 year old size.  Ty wished Dustin back to his previous size, and wished Dustin to have no memory of the event ever taking place.  Though he couldn&#39;t see it, he assumed that the changes took place.  Ty wanted every one of his moves to be planned out to exact the most pain, shame, indignity and to make it last.  Ty heard Dustin leave his room and head into the bathroom.  Ty decided to do some snooping.  He wasn&#39;t allowed in Dustin&#39;s room, he never had been.  Dustin made it clear early on that he would beat Ty to a pulp if he ever went in.  Ty wished that he was invisible and watched as he disappeared before leaving his room and going into Dustin&#39;s.  <br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s room was considerably larger than Ty&#39;s.  It was clear now that he was in Dustin&#39;s room that Ty&#39;s room was actually two rooms. Mark and June had had the wall removed between them to give Dustin more space.  The room Ty was now in was a walk in closet that had served one of the two rooms.  They had converted it into a room for him.  Ty explored the room.  Dustin had posters on the walls of sports teams and bikini clad women. He had a king size bed, a large TV, a sound system, various video game counsels, a computer, the list went on.  Ty had a bed, a desk, a chair, and a dresser.  The disparity in the two rooms was striking.  Ty felt his anger rising, he was distracted enough that he didn&#39;t hear the shower shut off and Dustin leave the bathroom.  Dustin entered his room and Ty froze.  After years of being terrified of just this scenario Ty&#39;s heart was racing.  He had to remind himself to start breathing again.  Dustin closed the door behind him as entered cutting off Ty&#39;s escape path.  Ty considered bolting to the door, opening it, and running to his room but decided against it.  He would just have to wait it out and it might even give him some material to work with.  <br />
<br />
Dustin had no reason to suspect that his invisible foster brother was standing frozen just feet from him when he walked into his room and shut the door.  Ty watched, slowly making his way out of the center of the room to stand next to the desk, as Dustin dropped his towel and headed over to his dresser. Dustin was tall for 16 at 6&#39;.  He had blond hair and blue eyes.  He had the makings of an impressive body, four small but defined abs peaked out on his stomach.  He had fairly impressive biceps and pecs, they had always intimidated Ty.  Ty couldn&#39;t remember seeing Dustin naked other than this morning.  He was more than disappointed to see that Dustin had been blessed in other areas too.  What Ty hadn&#39;t realized how much Dustin&#39;s penis had shrunk by the time the towel had fallen off.  Now that it was back to its former size, Ty couldn&#39;t believe it.  Dustin had at least 6&quot; of thick soft dick between his legs.  It looked like a flesh coke can with two golf balls beneath it.  Dustin had finished picking out an outfit to wear and stopped for a second.  Ty was certain that he&#39;d been discovered.  Dustin looked around the room before heading towards Ty.  Ty was just about to start begging for forgiveness when Dustin sat at his desk and woke his computer up.  Ty stood motionlessly afraid to even breath, he was so close he could reach out and touch Dustin.  Though he couldn&#39;t see what Dustin was doing, it became clear pretty soon.  The enthusiastic moaning of women soon filled the room. &quot;Fuck yea&quot; Dustin grunted, before starting to stroke his cock. Ty watched as it engorged adding at least 3 inches in length and some in thickness as it started to drip precum.  &quot;Yea you&#39;re a dirty slut,&quot; Dustin said to the screen, &quot;you need this huge dick in you, you&#39;ll do anything for it.&quot;  Dustin stood up stroking his boner faster and faster, Ty watched as Dustin clenched his ass, flexed his hips and then shot rope after rope of jizz all over his desk just missing the computer screen.  <br />
<br />
Dustin cleaned up his mess quickly, shut down the computer, and got dressed before leaving the room.  Ty didn&#39;t waste any time leaving the room and getting back to his and wishing himself visible again.  Ty didn&#39;t know if what he had seen was useful but at least he knew what Dustin&#39;s room looked like now and that he can make himself invisible.  He was still processing everything when Dustin came barging into his room, &quot;Dad wants you to clean the bathroom before my friends spend the night.&quot;  He left as quickly as he came in, leaving the door open.  Ty waited until he heard Dustin go down the stairs before wishing the bathroom clean.  The sleep over would be the perfect opportunity to start getting back at Dustin.</p>
