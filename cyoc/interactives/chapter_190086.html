<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wes had stripped Nick and Clark of their stained shirts during the cleanup process, leaving the pair of two-year-olds in nothing but their diapers as they cuddled up on the couch and held the phone together, each boy gripping one side of the device with a set of stubby fingers. Though the focus of both boys was on the wacky, colorful cartoon they had chosen to watch, both unconsciously moved nearer to one another as the silliness unfolded on the screen before them. Soon they were so close that their skinny shoulders and plump soft thighs were touching, both Nick and Clark emitting a barely-audible whimper as each boy&#39;s warm, baby-soft skin slid against that of the other. Though they tried to concentrate on the cartoon, both boys began sneaking glances at one another as they snuggled ever closer. This had been the first real moment Nick and Clark had had alone since their demotion to toddlerhood, the first chance for either boy to appreciate just how adorable the other was.<br />
<br />
Nick and Clark smiled and blushed when they caught each other peeking at the same time, crinkling in unison as they fidgeted shyly in their plush seats. As bashful as they were feeling, once their eyes met neither could take their gaze off the other. The adult features that had attracted them to one another were still there but in cherubic form. Clark&#39;s chiseled jaw had given way to a round dimpled chin and Nick&#39;s wavy hair had become a too-cute crown of golden-brown curls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dere, cutie pie.&quot; Clark giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey yourself, wugwat.&quot; Nick offered his little boyfriend a smile but could only hold it for a moment. &quot;What, um...what happened wif you an&#39; Weth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...don&#39; wanna talk about it.&quot; Clark&#39;s own expression darkened a bit. &quot;He jus&#39; went cwazy for a sec, dat&#39;s all...I dunno what got into him, but it wooks wike he got it out of his system. I fink we&#39;re gonna be okay.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The cartoon was now all but forgotten as Nick and Clark looked deeply into each other&#39;s eyes, hearts leaping with the affection and love the men turned toddlers had for each other. Instinct spurred them to lean in close, to softly bring their lips together into the sweetest kiss either had ever experienced. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hope I&#39;m not interrupting anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick and Clark jumped in their seats and turned beet red as they looked up to see Wes standing over them, the snogging toddlers so caught up in their kiss that they didn&#39;t even hear him return to the apartment. The man grinned as he plucked the blushing babes off the couch, balancing a boy on each of his hips with a canvas bag of supplies strapped over his shoulder. He carried Nick and Clark into the bathroom and set their bite-size feet down on the bathmat, the toddlers looking up at him curiously as he began filling the tub.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you think I meant by getting cleaned up?&quot; Wes chuckled as the boys&#39; eyes widened in realization. &quot;Hope you like lots of bubbles!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...w-we don&#39; need a baff...&quot; Nick cringed at how whiny his protests sounded but he pressed on just the same. &quot;...we&#39;re not <i>dat</i> dirty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s for daddy to decide, don&#39;t you?&quot; Wes knelt and grabbed the front of Nick&#39;s diaper, pulling it clean off in one quick motion. The two-year-old squeaked in indignation and reflexively shot his tiny hands downward to cover his tinier wee-wee, not realizing how silly he was being until Wes snickered at his show of modesty. The glow returned to Nick&#39;s chubby cheeks as he pouted and crossed his pudgy arms, a petulant posture that was mimicked by Clark when he was similarly stripped of his Pampers. Luckily, neither had to stand with their nubs out in the open for very long, as both were plucked off the bathmat and placed bottom-first into chest-height water positively rife with bubbles. Nick and Clark wriggled their tushies against the porcelain as they made a show of getting comfortable amongst the suds, neither wanting to admit how soothing the soak in the warm water actually was.<br />
<br />
&quot;The two of you play nice while daddy gets you all squeaky clean, okay?&quot; Wes cheerfully instructed as he soaped up a pair of fluffy rags. The boys frowned up at him before turning their attention to the bubbles, neither really sure what to do with them until Nick, struck by a childhood memory, gathered up all the foam his teeny hands could carry and mashed it into his jaw. Clark giggled at his little boyfriend&#39;s bubble beard, adorning his own dimpled chin with a fuzzy clump of foam as the baby boys shared a laugh at their silliness. Immediately caught up in their fun, Nick and Clark barely noticed when Wes took the rags to their silky soft skin. The man tenderly scrubbed behind the toddlers&#39; ears, then ran the rags along their slender shoulders and rubbed their backs in gentle circles. After that he moved to their plump arms, flabby chests and soft tummies, both boys looking up from their play for a moment to smile at Wes in gratitude of his tenderness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such good babies, not making any fuss as daddy gives them their bath.&quot; Wes cooed at his young charges. &quot;Could my favorite little guys please stand up so I can get them clean all over?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick and Clark did just that without even thinking about it, both boys giggling at the way the bubbles clung to their tiny naked bodies. Neither could focus on that for very long, though, as Wes&#39; rags - which had started at their ankles and scrubbed their way up their pudgy legs - were now lingering over the round, pillowy cheeks of their cute little butts. The smiles disappeared from their lips and the blush returned to their cheeks as Nick and Clark whimpered at the intimacy of the touch, any thought they had of piping up in protest disappearing as their babyish bodies trembled from head to toe at the how lovely it felt for Wes&#39; big, strong hands to explore such a supple and private area. That feeing only intensified when the man threaded the rags between Nick and Clark&#39;s legs, rubbing the fluffy soapy fabric against their smooth little sacs and along the miniscule length of their tiny rock-hard stiffies. The two-year-olds whined and groaned as they thrust their peepees into Wes&#39; palm, both knowing they were far too young to achieve climax but far too caught up in the overwhelming ecstasy of the moment to care.<br />
<br />
&quot;Annnnnnnnnnd all clean!&quot; Wes announced as he suddenly took his hands away from Nick and Clark&#39;s miniature, overstimulated privates. He chuckled at their needy groans as he wrapped them up in warm, downy towels and plucked them from the water, playfully drying the boys from head to toe as they blushed and pouted at the way their half-stiff weenies waggled between their milky thighs with the slightest movement. Those weenies were once more wrapped up in diapers but a minute later, though, as Nick and Clark were laid out on the bathmat after being dried so Wes could efficiently powder and Pamper them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just one last step before we go beddy bye...&quot; Wes declared as he bundled the boys back up in his arms. &quot;Do my favorite baby boys want to get dressed in their cute little jammies? Or are they okay sleeping in just their dipees?&quot;</p>
