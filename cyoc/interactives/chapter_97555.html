<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">over the years the cat girl turned human adapted into her role as Anna. After a few months of adjusting she starting fitting into who Anna was which was somewhat easy. Anna was a little girl who had very little to her due to the lack of her age. She was a kind girl, she loved her parents, she watched some T.V, and she played with Dolls. Sure  there were differences but the differences were explained with explained away by the trauma and brain damage Anna must&#39;ve went through. <br />
Anna&#39;s sister Courtney often cherished Anna since apparently she had accidentally caused something that had killed the real Anna, but she was glad that Anna apparently was alive. After a year Anna was brought into school where she managed to do alright and make some friends in her human school system. In the area there were very few people who weren&#39;t human except for a few pets or the occasional traveler. She made friends and kept them while making some pretty good grades. Her life was working out pretty well and  then she started getting some headaches as the drugs the scientists gave her was starting to wear off 7 years latter. <br />
One day Anna woke up to her alarm clock and dragged herself out of bed, and despite a splitting headache she dragged herself out of bed and got herself dressed. At the breakfast table Courtney was talking to her mom about something while some eggs and bacon were on the table. Anna asked &quot;Hey, what are you two talking about?&quot;<br />
Courtney simply said &quot;Oh, we were just talking about school and stuff. You alright you&#39;re still clutching your head.&quot;<br />
Anna nodded and said &quot;Yes i&#39;m alright. There&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot; <br />
Courtney looked to her mother who nodded and said &quot;Dear... We are worried about you and your head. Maybe we should go to a doctor, your headaches are getting worse and worse and... maybe it has something to do with that incident.&quot; <br />
Anna said &quot;I&#39;m fine, They are just headaches. I&#39;ve just been thinking a little harder than usual now so...&quot; <br />
Their mother said &quot;I&#39;m still scheduling a doctor&#39;s appointment just to be sure... now eat your breakfast and go to school.&quot; <br />
<br />
At school Anna&#39;s headache got better, and she handled the workload fine for her first few periods. At lunch she went to the cafeteria and got lunch with her friends. A small salad, a meat patty, and some fries were what Anna and her two other female friends got. The one boy named Troy who seemed to follow them got a burger and some tater tots and sat down. <br />
Anna asked &quot;So Sara how was your trip to your relatives.&quot; <br />
Sara responded by saying &quot;My relatives were fine, but the amount of non-humans were amazing. I swear you would see an elf or a vampire more than you would see a human... I had no idea how to talk to most people.&quot; <br />
Troy said &quot;A lot of non-humans speak English. Just use human courtesy and there shouldn&#39;t be any hard feelings.&quot; <br />
Nora said &quot;Don&#39;t share garlic fries to vampires though. They generally don&#39;t like that.&quot; <br />
Anna chuckled and said &quot;I wish I could travel around a lot more... But no.... My parents are apparently worried about my head... Oh yeah did you see any interesting breeds Sara?&quot; Anna ate one of her fries. <br />
Sara said &quot;there were these beast people here and there. My relatives even got a beastman... More like a cat boy though. Those cat people are-&quot; At the mention on cat people Anna grimaced in pain and held her head. Sara asked &quot;You alright Anna?&quot; <br />
Anna said &quot;Yeah i&#39;m fine... I just haven&#39;t been eating en-&quot; Anna&#39;s head started hurting more and more. Then the girl fell faint and collapsed on the cafeteria table. Anna could hear someone scream out of surprise or terror at a peer collapsing on a table and then fell unconscious. When Anna woke up she saw she was in her bed at home and was put in her pajamas. She felt a little strange under her shirt and raised it too see what felt so odd. As she lifted it she saw that she had some odd growths on her belly, but then realized they were additional nipples with small training bra breasts under them just like her original two. She shoved her pajama shirt down and then she started hearing something. <br />
<br />
her ears perked up as she heard her sister Courtney say &quot;I hope Anna just wont blame me for what&#39;s happening to her. She seemed so healthy afterwards but that incident must...&quot; <br />
her mother said &quot;Stop blaming yourself. What happened was something no one would be able to guess would happen.&quot; <br />
Wondering what was going on you got out of bed and after you got to the door and opened it to find your mother and sister talking further down the hall than you had expected.<br />
Courtney turned her head and she said &quot;Anna! Are you alright, is your head hur-...&quot; her eyes then went wide and she approached you and then asked &quot;Are your ears ok?&quot; <br />
You asked &quot;what do you mean?&quot; <br />
Courtney now next to you reached above your head and grabbed something above your head which you felt and then you giggled a bit as you felt a kinda tickle sensation. Courtney said &quot;... your ears are now... on top of your head... like a cat.&quot; <br />
your mother said &quot;I am making a doctor&#39;s appointment. you cannot say that that something like this can&#39;t be overlooked.&quot; <br />
You got courtney to stop touching you ears and then said &quot;That may be a good idea... I think I may get some more rest the-...&quot; You fell down again as you felt faint again. when you woke up.</p>
