<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A young proud man, a young man who was pretty much raped in all his sexual changes in the cabin, and a young man who was searching for a way out of this Cabin in the Woods; Now James was hot, naked, horny, and had just fucked a donkey that was once a man/women like him. James&#39;s downfall was already bad enough, but now he wanted more, more and more! This was the corruption of James and even though James hasn&#39;t noticed it yet, for the rest of his tenure in the cabin he will be weaker willed mentally and will struggle more often with temptation! It&#39;s one thing if you get raped by an animal, but to actually be the the dominant one and fucking an animal was a cardinal sin in the cabin. More you Act like an animal the more you Feel like an animal, James will need a really strong willpower if he wants to be the final survivor in the Cabin in the Woods! <br />
<br />
&quot;I should really name you something shouldn&#39;t I?&#128149;&quot;, James looked up to the donkey with lust in his eyes, He was lying on his butt and was staring at the donkeys vagina lustfully. Of course it was hard to think of a name &quot;Alex&quot; &quot;Dave&quot; &quot;George&quot; &quot;Carla&quot;, all those in the end were silly to James because he had no idea what the donkeys gender was before entering the cabin. James continued to think of a name, and then it hit him! He thought of his favorite Nfl football player Dakota Dak Prescott who played for the Dallas Cowboys. That was his favorite team back before they got in the cabin, Dakota seemed like a great gender neutral name. &quot;I think im going to name you Dakota&quot;, as James said this he started to stand up and his current objective was to fuck Dakota again!<br />
<br />
Dakota lowers its head down to the ground, wanting to be ploughed and fucked by this human again. Now fully standing up James grabbed  Dakoa by the tail and was going to put his large needy horsecock in that large slick slit of Dakota, but..... he hesitated when he saw his new mounds on his chest. Normally in the cabin the change would have been smaller like A cup sized breasts and worked it&#39;s way up. Acting like a naked horny animal had accelerated his changes. His breasts were about C cup size and were the same size off his mom&#39;s before they got here. Seeing these new breast&#39;s had made him hesitate, but not for the reason you would think!<br />
<br />
He felt emotions that he never felt before, fuzzy, ecstasy, Feminine, He wanted Dakota in another way. As james&#39;s started to fantasize his cock shrunk down to normal size, this was the first time he hadn&#39;t had an erection in what seemed like forever. His body almost rejected his advances and forced him into another &quot; what if...what if Dakota fucked me? I have breasts now, I could even be a mother&quot;, When fighting the cabins lust the most perverted thoughts will plague your mind, but you have to  be strong enough and resist it! James in a panic slapped Dakota in the ass and yelled &quot;Get out of here now!&quot;, James almost went on all fours, almost let Dakota nuzzle his naked body, almost gave in and he probably would have gotten a large moist slit like Dakotas, but James&#39;s own willpower prevailed. Dakota ran off and James was left standing in this warm weathered woods all to his lonesome. <br />
<br />
After narrowly avoiding a gigantic change to himself physically and emotionally; James began to wander in any direction knowing that no matter what it would lead him back to his new home. As james was walking back he couldn&#39;t help but feel disgusting for his actions, his hooves actually felt really good like a basketball player who just got their favorite pair of Nike shoes. His own ears being able to hear from long distances, furry tail swinging almost seductively, and above all else his milf sized breasts that would sway and jiggle everytime he moved his body. The areola on his breasts were as black as an ebony woman&#39;s, which would make them more visible to anybody near him and also would be wonderful if somebody sucked on them. This complacensy is what James hated the most, and how good it felt being naked...... <br />
<br />
The surrounding area of the cabin was really interesting. Around the cabin was basically plains and wide open area, no trees which meant  no real cover. James was already ashamed enough for his actions/feelings and would preferably not want anyone seeing him in his current state. As he wandered he found the opening out of the woods to the wide open property leading to the cabin. &quot;I quess there is no point in walking any further&quot;, James deduced that it would be better to just make a mad dash to the cabin and if anyone noticed him he could just say he got raped again &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be the first time&quot;, muttered James. James was facing the back of the cabin which was definitely better than the front.<br />
<br />
He would enter the only door in the back, which would lead right into the kitchen &quot;shouldn&#39;t be anyone in the kitchen right now&quot;, James said aloud trying to speak this statement into existence. James ran as fast as he could, hoping and praying he wouldn&#39;t be spotted. His breasts and horse cock kept on slapping him and jiggling as he booked it. Halfway there and James was sure this plan was going to work out, but of course things would not go so smoothly. As he ran he saw something that he didn&#39;t see before, James might have horse hearing, but he still only has human eyesight. There was someone standing right by the kitchen window, James wanted to slow down but without cover there was no point. Determined James continued to run and just hoped it was his dad since he can&#39;t transform incase anything got dicey.<br />
<br />
James got near enough to the door and he got an eyefull of what truly was by the door. Do you know how it feels to get pure adrenaline pumped into your body from arousal? That was like this for James, to see someone completely naked made his heart skip a beat, especially with him already running causing his heart to be already racing to begin with. James could see a naked figure standing by the kitchen window peering in, James could  only look at that thick ass and behind of the obvious woman. It had to be Joan and never in his whole life did he see his mom naked like this. Joan turned around from the kitchen window and saw James and couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing. James had no choice and finally reached his original destination, and  a naked/already horny Joan. Irony in this situation both were naked, and one had goat udders, the other had just got milf sized breasts!</p>
