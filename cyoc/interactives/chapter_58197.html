<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Why don't we become gorillas?&quot; said Connor. &quot;That could be really cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be awesome.&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go!&quot; said Jeremy. The boys snuck over to the gorilla exhibit. Fortunately, the gorillas were sleeping, so there was nobody there. Unfortunately, there was tall glass surrounding the enclosure. There was no way to get in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great.&quot; said Ryan. &quot;How are we going to get in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's too bad we couldn't become slugs and go under the glass.&quot; said Jeremy.<br />
<br />
Connor looked at the base of the glass, and noticed that there was a hair-thin opening between the bottom of the glass and the ground. Connor also noticed that there was a puddle of water next to the ground, which gave Connor an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys,&quot; said Connor. &quot;We could change into water, slide under the glass and change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm willing to try it.&quot; said Ryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; said Jeremy. The boys took off their clothes and hid them behind a bench.<br />
<br />
The brothers bent over and stuck their fingers in the puddle of water and concentrated, feeling the tingling feeling throughout their nude bodies. The boys began to feel very warm. Sweat began to form all over their chests. The boys groaned with pleasure as their feet liquefied, causing the boys to fall over onto the ground, on top of each other. <br />
<br />
Connor, Ryan and Jeremy were melting into a puddle of human skin colored liquid. The boys' chests began to dissolve. The brothers groaned as their bodies slowly melted into each other until there was a puddle of skin-colored water in their place.<br />
<br />
With sexual pleasure, the brothers began to slide their liquid bodies across the pavement, moving in and out of each others' forms. Connor, Ryan and Jeremy were in a state of sexual bliss, loving every moment of sliding through their bodies. Their liquefied states slid under the glass panel with ease and onto the grassy terrain of the gorilla enclosure.<br />
<br />
The skin-colored liquid stopped, resting within blades of grass. The liquid brothers concentrated and their puddle began to bubble. Out of the skin-colored liquid emerged assorted body parts. Ryan's arm stuck out first, and grabbed the ground, pulling his body out of his brothers' liquid forms as his body reformed. Connor's foot stuck out, growing and extending as it moved farther and farther away from the bubbling liquid mass that was the brothers changing forms. Slowly but surely, the brothers completed their transformations, lying in a circle. Ryan's foot, Jeremy's head and Connor's arm still emerging out of the now-smaller puddle of skin-colored liquid. The boys laid there, mud covering their naked bodies as their transformations were completed.<br />
<br />
The brothers just laid there for a few moments, stunned by their transformations. After a while, the brothers got up, and stretched their naked, mud-covered bodies. Suddenly, they heard an intercom message.<br />
<br />
&quot;Attention all Zoo Patrons.&quot; said the Announcer. &quot;The Gorilla exhibit will be opening in 2 minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The brothers suddenly snapped out of their trance-like states.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap!&quot; said Connor. &quot;We have got to hurry!&quot;<br />
<br />
The naked, mud-covered brothers ran over to the gorillas, who were still asleep. They picked out three males and the brothers each placed a hand on the gorillas, feeling the familiar tingling sensation. The boys ran off to different parts of the enclosure. The boys felt their transformations begin.<br />
<br />
Connor ran behind a tree and groaned with sexual pleasure as his shoulders expanded, squishing and cracking to form a gorilla's massive shoulders. Connor got down on all fours as his legs began to shorten, as they shortened, Connor's human legs widened, layers of muscle forming, changing his human legs into hairless gorilla legs. Connor watched as his chest bulged, his pecs growing and his human nipples growing into gorilla nipples. Connor groaned again as his human belly pushed outwards, forming that of a gorillas'. <br />
<br />
Connor's face elongated, and then bulged out. Connor's nose squished into itself and widened. His brow defined itself more. His face began to contort and shift into the skin of a gorilla's face, although his body remained his human skin tone, still hairless. Connor groaned again as his arms began to lengthen, growing larger and larger as his arms grew massive muscles, like barrels on his arms. Connor's ears flattened and shrank to become a gorilla's ears. <br />
<br />
Connor's gorilla body was mostly primate, except for his hands and feet and that his body was hairless and still human skin-colored. His penis suddenly bulged, growing from a human penis to one that matched Connor's expanding frame. Connor stretched his hands out as his thumbs shrunk and his fingers lengthened. His fingers became longer, but the tips became more stubby. Connor groaned louder as his feet cracked. His feet shortened, and began to resemble hands. His big toe slid down to the middle of his half human foot/half gorilla hand. Connor's other toes elongated, forming a gorilla foot.<br />
<br />
If anybody had seen Connor, they would have probably screamed. He had the head, body and hands of a gorilla, but his skin was still human and he had no fur. Suddenly Connor's skin began to darken, turning grey. Next, gorilla hair began to sprout all over his body. It was short on his face, wrists and legs, and longer everywhere else. Connor's human eyes were the last to change, turning into the gorilla's brown eyes. Connor's transformation was complete, he was a gorilla. He turned around and saw his new feet, now hands. He wiggled his toes, now fingers. Just as Connor walked out on all fours from behind the tree in his new gorilla body, the crowd came to the gorilla observation place. Connor looked over and saw Ryan and Jeremy in their gorilla forms, happily enjoying their new bodies. Connor did the same, loving the power he felt in his gorilla body.</p>
