<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How about you become Tomato?” She said to him.<br />
<br />
“Hm… Alright! So you are going to include me in your shake?” He responded back to her.<br />
<br />
“After you transform, I am going to take you, and will head home with me. When I arrive, I will decide on how I would eat you…” She said to him.<br />
<br />
“I can’t wait!” He said while getting even more excited.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure about this? Oh, and by the way. What did you set the duration to?” She anxiously said to him, worried on what will happen.<br />
<br />
“Well, Yes! I set the duration until Monday, after the weekend!” He confidently said to her.<br />
<br />
“Alright, but know this! No matter what, I will treat you like any other piece of food I will be having. You won’t be human throughout the weekend. My body will give you no mercy, and you better enjoy the ride!~” She said to him, while rubbing her grumbling tummy.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I think everything seems good! I will start transforming… NOW!” He said to himself after checking his settings, and then pressed enter, starting his transformation from a human to a tomato for his girlfriend!<br />
<br />
At first, nothing seemed to be happening. But after a few seconds, he felt a weird tickling sensation all over him, pacifically his crotch region. Within moments, his wiener had grown, and hardened at an extreme level. He then start to notice his own hands, and his arms starting to loose it&#39;s shape, wilting, and absorbing into his upper torso. But for some strange reason he can still feel them, felling them in his lower region. He looks down at his own wiener, noticing that it looks bigger, all the mass that is or was his arms, is now becoming a part of his own wiener. He then feels both of his legs doing the same thing, being absorbed into his own wiener, making his wiener grow at almost half the size his body. He are now just a head, and torso with a giant wiener, but that will soon change. As his whole torso starts to loose definition, shrink down, and absorb into his wiener, giving it extra mass making it become even bigger! Now all that is left is his own head, which is starting to melt, and absorb into his own wiener like the rest before. Except his hair, which will act as the stem of the tomato he will eventually become. He still has all of his senses; he can feel/touch, he can smell, and taste as whole a through his own wiener’s body. He can’t talk, nor he can move, he will become like any ordinary ripe tomato after all. Now with his hole vision, he can see at all angles, a 360 degree view of all of his surroundings. Once that phase was done, he is now just his own disembodied wiener! But big! Now for the next phase...<br />
<br />
He then start’s to feel his whole body becoming more soft, becoming more moist. Jenny’s probable guess that he is starting to melt and mold into a tomato shape. His wiener body is starting to mold it’s self, starting to mold into a bare tomato like structure. His wiener body is now done being shaped like any ordinary bare tomato. He then start to feel another sensation that is happening to him. His body’s skin color is starting to change to a more red color, while also dissolving his supposed organs, skin, etc. to become to tomato-like. But he can still feel every part of his body melting, molding, and rearranging. While his girlfriend watches his own boyfriend turning into the ingredient she needs for making her breakfast shake. The tomato that is also Jenny’s boyfriend is now complete, he is now completely at the bare bones a tomato, but at the size of his whole body. In reality, there’s no such thing as a tomato the size equivalent of a human, but the machine will soon fix that with it’s final touches. So the giant tomato that “was” once Jenny’s boyfriend, starts to shrink down to the size of the very “fruit” he have so destined to become. The machine finished it’s job, and as for the result he is now nothing more then a mere tomato for his girlfriend. For him everything has gone black for a moment, but then eventually regained all of his senses. He can see, feel, smell, and taste! He can see at all angles, a 360 degree view of all of his surroundings! He realized he can&#39;t move nor talk, which makes sense for being what he is now currently. He looks around using his new “fruit-like” body, and dazzled on how the world from this perspective looks so huge!<br />
<br />
Jenny then walks over to the tomato which was her boyfriend. She looks down at her prey, with a chuckle. He looks up at the 19 year old red haired beauty, towering on top of him at the size of a skyscraper, realizing how insignificant he is. Reality came back to him as the giantess’s hand lowers down towards him, and effortlessly plucks the tomato off the floor, which was her boyfriend. She raises him up to her beautiful face to inspect his delicious self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Jeffy, you&#39;re the real deal!&quot; The tomato didn’t respond, as she then gives him a lick; &quot;You even taste like it!&quot; She said surprised, as he also got a sensitive sensation over her lick. “Alright, time to head out! I am going to put you, and your clothes in this empty backpack so enjoy “this” ride until I get home.” She said to the tomato that was her boyfriend, as she places him on his own bed. She grabs the bag, while he watches his girlfriend stuffing his clothes inside the bag. She then plucks him, and stuffs him in the bag with his clothes. Then he watches her zipping the bag while inside, leaving her tomato boyfriend in darkness. She then grabs the bag’s long strap handle, and hangs it on her shoulder as she departs from Jeff’s house. He hears, and feels her crashing steps from the outside of his bag prison. Getting all excited on being eaten by a female, that is also a year older than him.(Screw you pedos! LOL!) Jeff always has the hots with women that are older than him, also liking to be dominated, or teased by one. He is lucky to have a women like Jenny.<br />
<br />
When she arrived her mother called. “Jen! Are you home!?!” Her mother said out loud from upstairs. “Yes! It’s me mom! I am back from the mall with my friends!” She yelled back at her mom. “Good, and I hope you didn’t lie and messed with any guys while you were out!” She yelled at her daughter from upstairs. “God! Don’t worry, I did not!” She countered back to her mom out loud. “Alright! I am just doing this for your own good! I want you to have a real healthy relationship in a year or 2, when you are 21! Not some relationship where you-” She said out loud from upstairs, while getting cut off by her own daughter. “BLA-blabla-bla-BLA! I get it already! Sheesh! I am going to make myself something before we go out to the gym!” She responded back to her mother out loud. “Alright, it better be quick! Because we have to leave in about, 15 minutes! I am in the bathroom currently, so I’ll be out in a minute or two!” Her mother responded. “Alright!” She said back to her mother.<br />
<br />
While she walked over to the kitchen, she opened the bag and plucked the tomato out of the bag. “Alright, Jeffy… I am going to leave you here on this kitchen counter for now. I need to hide your clothes in my room before my mother notices me carrying them, or she will get suspicious. Don’t worry, I’ll be right back…~” She whispered to him with a nice tone, giving Jeff a sense tremble, as she quickly dashes upstairs to her room. Since Jeff never got to see what his girlfriends mother looks like, this will probably be a great opportunity to do so, and hopes that she doesn’t notice him while at it.</p>
