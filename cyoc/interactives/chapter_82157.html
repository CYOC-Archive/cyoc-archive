<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he dropped Jason off at the bar he tied him to a table and went to the bar tender. They had a little <br />
conversation and he left.<br />
<br />
The first few guys went up to Jason. One at his mouth the other at his ass. When they came they went over to <br />
the bar tender who took payment for the use and they ordered a drink.<br />
<br />
Over and over again this scene played out. It wasn't as though Jason disliked the events. His increased libido <br />
made him crave the attention. His cock was encased in a chastity device but still tried to get hard. As he <br />
laid on his back he head hanging over the edge of the table in the right position for anyone to come and stick <br />
their cock in and fuck his mouth he got more and more bloated. His legs were tied down so that they were next <br />
to his torso. Max didn't want them to get in the way as men used his ass.<br />
<br />
It could have been minutes or hours or weeks before the UPS man came and untied him. Having been tied up all <br />
day long he was unable to use his legs. Being thrown over the UPS man's shoulder he felt the pressure of his <br />
cum filled belly. His ass, although taking all sizes of cocks snapped shut and held that cum inside of him.<br />
<br />
So how did we do? Max said to the bar tender.<br />
<br />
Not bad for a first timer Max. This was the first time that Jason had heard the UPS drivers name.<br />
<br />
There were a couple thousand dollars that the bar tender handed to Max. Jason watched as he counted it and <br />
handed the bar tender his cut.<br />
<br />
He will be back Friday night.<br />
<br />
This was Monday. Jason was wondering why such a long time before he was back.<br />
<br />
When Max and Jason got back to Max's house Max took Jason to the bathroom took him to the shower and stuck a <br />
hose up his ass. Filling up his ass his abdomen bloated. He filled him and emptied him and filled him and <br />
emptied him. His abdomen stretched with each filling. With the last filling he stuck a plug up his ass and sat <br />
him down next to his bed. He put a harness over his shoulders holding him down and had Jason open his mouth. <br />
His stomach was going to be harder to bloat. He put in a funnel and filled him with water.<br />
<br />
Jason stayed filled all night long. <br />
<br />
When Max woke he emptied Jason and filled him again.<br />
<br />
This went on all week long till he was so bloated from the fillings. Max emptied him and he looked like a <br />
deflated balloon. Max took him to the bar strapped him down and told the bar tender he would be back sunday <br />
night.<br />
<br />
And the fillings began.<br />
<br />
Over and over again Jason took the fillings willingly. He hadn't cum since last monday and hadn't had anyone <br />
cum in him, not even Max so he was needing the attention.<br />
<br />
Sunday evening Max returned.<br />
<br />
Unknown to Max he wasn't the only one to be checking up on Jason. Jeff was there too. <br />
<br />
He saw the complete glee on the face of his brother. He had never seen such a look of ecstasy on his brothers <br />
face before and he knew some how that he needed this and would keep his brother this way but Jeff wasn't happy <br />
at how the UPS man was treating him.<br />
<br />
When Jeff got home that night he pulled up the profile of Max. He saw an option for inanimate and clicked on <br />
it. There was an option box that opened up when he clicked on the inanimate option and he typed in composting <br />
toilet. And he put duration to 6 months.<br />
<br />
When Max got to work the next morning and went to the bathroom he changed into the composting toilet. The <br />
toilet he was in disappeared and his head began to change. His body fed through a hole in the wall and all <br />
that was visible was his toilet head. Someone had to clean out the compost depending on how much he was used. <br />
The first week not many used him so it was a week before he was cleaned out. Someone went to the chamber <br />
behind the wall and pressed his belly button which was now an outie and his belly opened up. A shovel was <br />
shoved into the lower abdomen and he was shoveled out.<br />
<br />
This continued for the six months. Occasionally being forgotten to empty and Max, because he was set to <br />
consciousness, felt the back up in his belly. When the six months were over he changed back to human but his <br />
belly was so bloated from the shit he had eaten and he had a need for shit, piss and cum that he had never <br />
known before. He had always been the dominant one but not now. He needed to be used.<br />
<br />
Jeff noticed that Max was now out of his prison and saw the scene on his screen. He changed Max into a gas <br />
filled balloon. He floated off and found himself landing in the winter quarters of a freak show. Being the <br />
largest man they had ever seen he was billed as the fat man. But being filled with gas he was so much lighter <br />
than a similarly sized fat man. He had two openings at his ass. One exuded methane which the freaks plugged up <br />
with an inflating butt plug with a hose that tapped the gas and they used for power and heat. The other hole <br />
in his ass exuded compost. The freaks had the most lush garden in Arizona due to his compost. And since he was <br />
unable to move a hose was hooked up to his cock and he sat there and consumed more than and elephant. The <br />
bathrooms were emptied for him since he had now developed a taste for their contents and he lived out his life <br />
being used just as he had planned for Jason.<br />
<br />
But Jason took control of Max's apartment and struck a bargain with the bar tender and found a well paying <br />
life of male prostitution being sold to the men in the bar on the weekends. He didn't need to work during the <br />
week from the funds he made during the weekend.<br />
<br />
Jeff noticed his brother was now really happy.</p>
