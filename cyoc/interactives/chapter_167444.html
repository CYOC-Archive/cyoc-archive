<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Was there even any point in being cautious about this? She&#39;d already had some rich lunatic give her an entirely new body. What the hell was going to be the harm of an extra addition, or even a few? She&#39;d probably have to consume most of these eventually.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it. All at once, let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Catherine raised an eyebrow. &quot;Quite the bold choice.&quot; Her tone was oddly approving - she supposed that being so forward and direct about this was probably appealing to her client. That, or Allison had just committed some sort of genetic suicide, and she was preparing to watch her death with amusement.<br />
<br />
The various liquids formed into a rainbow as Zhang mixed them into a beaker, bubbling and reacting with each other. Immediately Allison thought of a great joke comparing it to a witch&#39;s cauldron at a pride parade, but kept it to herself. No need to piss off the woman who was about to serve a freaky mutant cocktail.<br />
<br />
The blonde remained silent as she handed Allison the contoction, merely keeping up an amused smile. She was silent in turn, examining the beaker&#39;s contents for only a moment before she threw it back, intending to drink the stuff in one go.<br />
<br />
It was like sandpaper on her throat. Every hard liquor she&#39;d ever consumed, even absinthe that one time - it didn&#39;t hold a candle to the burn of this stuff. She could barely get the whole thing down before she slammed the beaker back onto the table and coughed violently. &quot;Oh fuck!&quot; God, that was painful. A hand came up to her throat, trying to massage the agony. &quot;Holy! Shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Doubling over the table, she leaned her elbows against the surface, just in time for a wave of pain to hit her in the arms. She thought at first that she might have slammed some nerves into the metal or something, but it wasn&#39;t that sort of blunt pain. It was a sharp sort of agony, searing from one end of her arms to another. She growled, trying not to scream at how much it hurt - it almost felt like her arms were each being ripped in half.<br />
<br />
She thought that might be the case when she hear a tearing sound, and felt the pain double in its intensity. A breathless cry came out as she couldn&#39;t help but bring her hands up to check on them. They came into her vision trembling both of them - all four of them.<br />
<br />
All... what?!<br />
<br />
Her gasps of shock seemed to draw a satisfied reaction from Catherine as she looked down at her arms. Her two pairs of arms, a new pair having emerged from her torso right below the previous ones. The pain in all of them, mercifully, subsided quickly, replaced by the alien sensation of twenty fingers grasping at her body. &quot;What the fu-&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison&#39;s obscenity was cut short as she felt the pain return, this time in her chest. Well, right below her chest, to be specific. Her lower pair of arms flew to the spot, and as she feared, something was emerging, as if being pulled out of her body right through her flesh. More arms, she wondered - no, no, they were so... soft. So.. round... just like... just like what was above them.<br />
<br />
Nearby, a mirror allowed her to confirm what she had begun to suspect. Another pair of breasts, every bit as perky and generously-sized as the existing pair, had emerged, perfectly aligned with her new arms. She was in shock, struggling to even process the sight before her, let alone the sensations now filling her mind. They were every bit as sensitive as the originals - and all four, she realized, were growing, gaining in size. Her back muscles strained at the tremendous increase in weight, as four new globes of flesh each as big around as her head dangled from her front.<br />
<br />
She wanted to scream and demand to know what kind of monster Catherine was turning her into, but she was distracted by the burning as it spread through her whole body. She screamed, the agony forcing her to stand upright - and she realized in her fog of pain that the weight seemed to have lightened. For a moment, she hoped that her chest had shrunk back down, but the four mountains remained. It had merely become easier to support them... not surprising, as she watched her slender frame gain definition.<br />
<br />
No bulk or mass, no, she was still quite graceful in that regard. But she could see the minimal fat on her body giving way to muscle, her biceps and thighs becoming athletic marvels that still kept their feminine beauty. Her stomach tightened, hints of a six-pack becoming just barely visible as she ran a hand over the taut muscles. So much strength rippled through her, power that helped her to grit through the next changes.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t hard to guess what it meant when her legs began to feel as if they were being ripped apart. She leaned against the table, keeping her lower limbs straight and apart as they agonizingly split, another pair of legs emerging from her backside along with another pert, rounded ass. Her torso stretched, giving the back legs some distance from the front, and between them, she gasped as another entrance was ripped open. Her lower hands almost instantly shot down towards the slit at her front, as the heat from her arousal mixed with the agonizing heat of the change to become an ovwehelming mix of pain and pleasure.<br />
<br />
They were in a perfect spot to feel out the final addition made to her body. A lump of flesh, just above her clit, that began to rapidly push out in a long, narrow shape. It reached what must have been a foot in length before halting, the formless mass quickly taking on a definition that she couldn&#39;t fail to recognize. Her brain tried to deny what it was, but the emergence of two more hard lumps, dropping near the base of the shaft in a single sack, solidified the reality. Her lower hands gripped the new member in disbelief - she had held plenty of erect rods within her hands, but never had she imagined grasping at her own. The pleasure of rubbing her hands up and down its length briefly sent her eyes rolling back before she forced herself to let it go, eyes trailing back up to Catheine.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell did you to do me?!&quot; She pleaded. The pain, it had all faded now, and in its place was arousal well beyond her control. Every part of her, every inhuman new addition, ached to be touched. She gasped as Zhang approached, whimpering slightly at the feeling of a single finger pressed against her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve made you into something incredible,&quot; the other woman replied in a hushed tone. &quot;I know - you must think you&#39;re some kind of monster.&quot; She reached up to wipe the tears from Allison&#39;s eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I can see how beautiful you really are.&quot;</p>
