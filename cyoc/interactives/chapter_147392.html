<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having seen how successful his first test was, Jeff was inspired to try other things. His thoughts ran wildly along with the power this could potentially bring to him. The only issues that arose at this time was having to be at his computer and knowing who his target was... If only there was a portable version of the Chronivac. Then he could do whatever he wanted with whoever, wherever he was. <br />
<br />
While Jeff sat puzzling out this problem of his, his little sister Kelly had listening to the noise coming from upstairs. Once it had died down she decided to wait just a bit longer so she didn&#39;t interrupt her mom. She loved sticking it to Jeff whenever she got the chance and today gave her another chance. Giddy with herself she made her way to Jeff&#39;s room to give him some trouble of her own. If Mom asked about it later she&#39;d just tell her Jeff started it, worked every time. <br />
<br />
As Jeff exited his ex-mother&#39;s info, he saw that it had been saved as a file for later alterations. Not that he planned to make any liking her just as she was. He opened a fresh page just as Kelly poked her head around the door frame. Ordinarily this would just be the beginning of further grief in his day but, with his toy dribbling away on his desk, he was less concerned. In fact, he pretended not to have seen her yet hiding his grin. Opportunity knocked once in a lifetime unless it was in the form of two nosey bitches. He entered Kelly&#39;s name into the statistics and watched it fill out as before.<br />
<br />
Name: Kelly<br />
Race: Human<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Age: 12<br />
Hair: Auburn<br />
Height: 4&#39;6&quot;<br />
Weight: 83 lbs<br />
Bust: A<br />
Waist: 22 inches<br />
Gluteus: 24 inches<br />
<br />
Jeff hadn&#39;t expected much as far as these stats were concerned, what could he expect? If she were a bit older than maybe... Without a second thought he adjusted the age field from 12 to 19. He marked the change awareness field as unaware just to see the results. He clicked enable as she rounded the doorway.<br />
<br />
Kelly spied on her idiot brother from his doorway and was satisfied seeing he hadn&#39;t noticed her yet. Really, when he was on that computer he made it too easy for her. She finally came out from around the frame as he typed away. <br />
<br />
Kelly: &quot;I heard Mom really giving it to you this time.&quot; She said in an impish tone. &quot;You think you&#39;re so smart getting things delivered while she&#39;s not home. Not on my watch!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kelly pressed her hands to her hips, at this moment the change had begun to take effect. She didn&#39;t seem to take notice to any of them as she grew thicker and taller. Not even to her clothes tightening and riding up her frame not changing along with her. She did however pull at the shirt collar as it tightened causing the elastic to break and hang loose. All through the changes to their end, she continued to mock Jeff as she always did after Mom left. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the screen noticing the changes seemed to have halted.<br />
<br />
Name: Kelly<br />
Race: Human<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Age: 19<br />
Hair: Auburn<br />
Height: 5&#39;6&quot;<br />
Weight: 132 lbs<br />
Bust: C<br />
Waist:24 inches<br />
Gluteus: 28 inches<br />
Change Awareness: Unaware<br />
<br />
Jeff looked on in amusement at the all too tight children&#39;s clothes looking as if one false from tearing away. That aside, this at least gave him an idea of how his ex-mother would&#39;ve looked at this age. He had to say to himself that she wasn&#39;t hard on the eyes as she once had been. Now he turned back to the computer much to a huff from Kelly, who wasn&#39;t used to this calmness he was portraying. As a &quot;mercy&quot; to his sister, he had the Chronivac remove her old clothing. No need to replace them as she wouldn&#39;t need them anymore anyway.<br />
<br />
When Jeff turned away from Kelly once more she paused for a moment. He&#39;d never been able to ignore her prodding before, what had changed? That was when Kelly noticed the puddle reflecting her on the floor. What was that puddle? She visually probed around the room for a clue or two and found one in the form of white lace panties stuck against the wall. Walking over to them to get a better look she noted Jeff was still ignoring her. Making it to the panties, she saw that the were very wet, soaked even, causing them to stick in a careless bunch to the wall. The heady scent permeating them also hit her like a physical force causing her to recoil away. <br />
<br />
Kelly: &quot;Oh, Oh that&#39;s sick... Are these Mom&#39;s? Did... Did you jack off with them? What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; She shuddered as she spoke with derision.<br />
<br />
Jeff mentally reprimanded himself for what she was saying. Not because she was right, technically she wasn&#39;t right at all. He hadn&#39;t used them to masturbate, he used their ex-mother, herself. The latter of which had made another even more potent puddle on the desk next to him. Having said that, the puddle had nearly stilled as her twitching slowed to the occasional stray gust of breath. His reprimanding was based on his callousness of tossing them away instead of &quot;deleting&quot; them. Oh well, Jeff thought to himself, nothing to be done about it now. Might even keep them as part of the whole set. <br />
<br />
Kelly: &quot;So? What, you couldn&#39;t get a girl on your own so you grabbed the next best thing? What a loser of a big brother you are.&quot; She cackled and saw Jeff turn toward her again. &quot;Got your attention did it? Good, because I&#39;m not eve...&quot; <br />
<br />
That was when she caught sight of the toy leaking all over the side of his desk. It looked so real, like she could swear she saw it move. What really caught her eye though was the size of the puddle it had made and that Jeff didn&#39;t seem to care about it. She caught a mix of white and clear on the desk and shuddered. So that&#39;s what he had delivered then, Sicko.<br />
<br />
Kelly: &quot;Oh wow. Panties weren&#39;t enough huh?&quot; She started talking again to get her nerve back. &quot;So you got a toy to do it with? What&#39;s the matter? You&#39;re hand not putting out anymore?&quot; She snickered as she fell back into her groove.<br />
<br />
Jeff however had prepared himself for this after his own inner monologue. Why not just be honest, he thought to himself. After all, honesty is the best policy they always say.<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;No, I didn&#39;t buy it, you brought it to me.&quot; Jeff couldn&#39;t help but grin as he thought out his words. &quot;You see, I got tired of you and IT always ganging up on me. So, I decided why not finally get my just desserts? Mom, just feels so good now that she&#39;s become what she was always meant to be. A small, fleshy, wet, hungry, cunt ever-willing to please. Isn&#39;t that right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff snatched the toy from its resting place causing it to flop furtively. The lips spasmed with the sudden rough treatment dribbling once more. Placing his forefinger and thumb on either side of the lips, he moved them open and closed as he spoke.<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;That&#39;s right, Jeff. I was ever so wrong to treat you like I did. Now that I&#39;m being true to myself, I can please you all day long, if that&#39;s what you want.&quot; <br />
<br />
This crass puppetry proved to be too much stimulation as the toy squirted out a couple of times. One of the squirts came out with enough force to land squarely on Kelly&#39;s exposed chest. Who in the shock of it, only smeared the mess as she tried to wipe it off.<br />
<br />
Kelly: &quot;Y-You really are sick, you know that? There&#39;s no way that&#39;s Mom, it&#39;s impossible!&quot; She called out into the hallway for their mother. &quot;You&#39;re really going to get it this time! Mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff just shook his head dropping the toy on the desk again causing a splash of new and old fluids. He started typing into the inanimate fields having gotten idea while Kelly ran her mouth. Maybe he could MAKE a portable version on the program. He did have a smartphone and a less than willing target to try this out on. <br />

<br />
It was worth a shot he thought as he wasted no time clicking enable. He turned to his phone buzzing, he hadn&#39;t put it on vibrate... He regarded his phone as a thin blue line faded into view from the skin to Kelly&#39;s feet. He stared in minor awe as he watched the change working. His annoying sister was being downloaded into his phone.<br />
<br />
Kelly had moved to take a step out of the room but, felt a pull on her feet. She looked down in time to see her feet change from solid to intangible blue light. She followed it with her eyes over to its source, Jeff&#39;s phone. She frantically grabbed the door frame to pull away but, it was too strong. By now, Jeff&#39;s face had gone from surprise to an evil smile. What he had said about their mom... She looked at the dribbling object on the desk with fear. By now the light and consumed up to her waist eliciting a coiling moan as it pulled her womanhood away. <br />
<br />
Kelly: &quot;H-Hey, there&#39;s no reason to do this. I can stop, I can do whatever you want. J-Just stop this, please!&quot; She started sobbing softly just as another moan rattled out while the phone consumed her breasts. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be like Mom, I don&#39;t want to be a toy!&quot; She gave Jeff unknowingly the same pleading look as her mother.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched with wicked amusement as Kelly begged and pleaded. Finally, she was getting hers and he&#39;d be rid of her too. The grin on his face widened as her pleading was interrupted by pleasure when certain &quot;bits&quot; were pulled in. She really was disappearing &quot;bit by bit&quot; He didn&#39;t suppress his laugh as he watched the light reach her neck.<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;Just like I told my first toy when it begged. You&#39;re going to be pleasing me any time I want from now on.&quot; He sure his grin was as wide as it could be when the change finished. Where Kelly had stood there was not even a trace of her. However on his phone he saw a new app marked with a pink and purple K. His once sister&#39;s favorite colors. He tapped the app and it came up with &quot;Kiri brought to you by Chronivac&quot; A moment later and Kelly&#39;s nude huddling form appeared on the screen. Seeing him, Kelly banged on the screen as if only trapped on the other side. In the upper left corner was a menu button, Jeff tapped it and watched as Kelly slid to the side and froze in a default pose. <br />
<br />
He went through the &quot;avatar&quot; options, playing around as he warped Kelly&#39;s form in various ways. Her breasts swelled and and shrank, her body widened and stretched, interestingly it had a slider for orgasm levels. He decided as she was now at his disposal he would set it to max just to see. He closed out of the menu to observe the effects it would have. As the menu slid away Kelly unfroze from the default pose and immediately fell to her knees. She moaned and screamed so loudly it was as if she was still in the room. Much like the toy had, fluid flooded out of her vagina in spurts and constant flow. She grabbed her left breast kneading it as she unnecessarily teased her sex with her right hand. <br />
<br />
Like a soldier&#39;s second wind, Jeff found his own member standing firm with the stimuli. It was a good thing he had help so close by. He sat the phone arched against the monitor to watch the show as he plunged his member into the toy. He&#39;d gone for 2 rounds and felt exhausted from the effort, including the previous spur of the moment test run. He tossed the toy on the floor, letting it splatter for yet another mess to clean. Opening the menu again, froze &quot;Kiri&quot; back to default, he settled on keeping the bar on low. Couldn&#39;t hurt to keep her constantly aroused for his own humor. He also noted the costumes option, just in case he did care about her in public. Now he&#39;d test the rest of the change, closing out of the menu again. &quot;Kiri&quot; laid out on the voidscape panting heavily looking as worn as he felt. <br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;Kiri.&quot; He watched as his former sister snapped up almost inhumanly quick. <br />
<br />
Kiri: &quot;Yes, User?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;You will address me as Master from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiri: &quot;Yes, Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;Good, open the Chronivac program.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a nod, Kiri splayed a menu from her hands. Sure enough, it was in fact the Chronivac or at least it looked like it. Scrolling through he found his Ex-mother and sister&#39;s folders. Opening his ex-mother&#39;s had revealed everything was the same. He wondered if it would work, it occurred to him that people would notice them missing eventually. He didn&#39;t think he could change them all either so he entered in a field called World Awareness, non-existent except to him. Afterward, he backed out to Kiri again for the next test.<br />
<br />
Jeff: &quot;Kiri, search for Sharon, our... my mother.&quot; Kiri seemed to be mulling over the request for a moment.<br />
<br />
Kiri: &quot;No such person found...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff paused to take that in, as far as the world was concerned his ex-mother never was. This revelation meant he could get away with everything he did. During his revelation, it seemed being left so long let &quot;Kiri&quot; become Kelly again. <br />
<br />
Kelly stared at her &quot;Master&quot; in terror as she knew being part of Kiri what he had done. He had completely reduced their mom to a dirty toy. She had never been anything more than that. She saw the toy laying in a new pool on the floor in the rear camera. Kelly would have shed a tear if the next menu search hadn&#39;t brought her back to Kiri.<br />
<br />
Jeff went into his ex-sister&#39;s folder this time. He had done the same thing in her folder, World Awareness: Non-existent except for him. He backed out and made Kiri search for Kelly this time. The news came as satisfyingly as the last. &quot;No such person found.&quot; This time he waited purposefully for Kelly to return. With glee he regarded her horrified expression as she now knew that she only existed to serve Jeff. Before she could say anything Jeff closed the app causing her to disappear with it.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat his phone on the dry part of the desk and laid out on his bed. Tomorrow he&#39;d go out and play with his newest toy to make yet more. Until then, he was spent from the use of the first and went to sleep.</p>
