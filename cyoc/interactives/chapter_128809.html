<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay walked down the stairs, and was quickly greeted by her mother as she entered the doorway to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning darling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
She rubbed her eyes quickly, trying to get the sleep out of them. As she reopened them, she could see everything a bit more clearly. Her mother smiled at her, whilst making breakfast. Her father looked up from this morning&#39;s newspaper, handing his daughter a stern look, but also a small nod as to greet her.<br />
<br />
His eyes were focused on the paper again, and Jay turned to her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for having let me stay this weekend. It was fun having seen you again,&quot; She looked at the kitchen table, and all of the delicacies on top of it. Her mouth started to water. That&#39;d be a typical English breakfast. Glancing at what her mom was making, she saw her baking some brown beans. &quot;Is it okay if I join breakfast as well, before I head back to my dorm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure hon, but please help me out with it then. Could you make the bacon and eggs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay shrugged, &quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, the bacon is in the fridge, you&#39;ll have to walk to the chicken coop outside to gather some eggs for us three.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood,&quot; Jay said as she grabbed her coat from the hanger. Putting it around her shoulders, she stepped into a pair of flip flops (presumably from her father, considering the size of them) and headed outside.<br />
<br />
There was a mild breeze, and it was drizzling, as predicted by the weather forecast yesterday. The house her parents lived in was surrounded by fields, yet still close enough to the city Jay now lives in for studying, that it only takes a 30 minutes drive using public transport. Her parents themselves didn&#39;t own a field to grow crops, they just lived there, as it was situated in a peaceful environment. Despite that, her parents still had their own ways to produce food. The back garden was big, so they&#39;d bought several sheep to let them live there. Besides the sheep, as said earlier, Jay&#39;s father had also bought a chicken-run and owned 5 chickens and a rooster.<br />
<br />
Knowing she was too clumsy to carry the eggs in her arms, Jay grabbed a basket filled with straw and brought it with her to the chicken coop. Entering the small pen, a few chickens lifted their wings, startled by the intruder. The quickly calmed down, as they assumed she wasn&#39;t a threat. The cackling went on.<br />
<br />
Most of the chickens stood up from their nests as Jay brought her hands towards them, most of the chickens would occasionally lay eggs, often once a day. She had quickly gathered the needed three eggs for breakfast, and still needed to look in the nest of Becky. That chicken had been the most productive, having never missed out on laying eggs at least once a day for the past few months. In some more exceptional cases, her mother, as she&#39;d told Jay, found 3 eggs in Becky&#39;s next.<br />
<br />
Jay reached out for the nest with her hand, but the chicken didn&#39;t feel like moving. Jay retracted her hand for a moment, but then attempted moving Becky elsewhere with a couple of mild shoves. Making contact with the feathers somehow made Jay shiver. She got goosebumps on her arms, but she thought the least of it. The chicken finally stood up, and all was normal again in a couple of seconds. Becky stepped out of her nest, as Jay looked inside.<br />
<br />
Oh, nothing.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s both normal and odd for the same time. It was definitely more unusual for Becky though.<br />
<br />
Jay stepped out of the pen, and jogged back to the house. She closed the door behind her and hung her coat back on the hanger again. The clock showed 8 in the morning. In about an hour she had to be in college for the first class. The bus would arrive at the nearest busstop from her parents&#39; house in 25 minutes. The pan was already on the furnace, the bacon strips strategically placed in the center of it by her mother. Jay shoved them a bit more to the site with a spatula to have them and the eggs parted from each other.<br />
<br />
A quick breakfast and hurrying to get ready later, Jay waved goodbye to her parents as she stepped out of the house. She ran to the busstop and was just 2 minutes early as the bus arrived.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Jay silently grunted as the professor kept rattling about the subject he was teaching. His lecture would go on until twelve o&#39;clock. She gave a quick glance at her smartphone: &quot;11:51&quot;. She stretched her arms by her sides and let out a silent yawn. She made a face with it, but everyone was tired as well, so nobody noticed. And if they did, they wouldn&#39;t be bothered by it whatsoever.<br />
<br />
The grunting from earlier was from the stings Jay felt from time to time, in her underbelly. She must&#39;ve eaten something wrong, but she couldn&#39;t bring to her mind what that &#39;wrong&#39; must&#39;ve been. Having eaten too much was probably best conclusion to be made. She&#39;d thought of salmonella poisoning from the eggs, but it didn&#39;t hurt too much, yet. Besides, the eggs had been closer to burnt than to being eaten raw.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed, and Jay felt the need to go to the toilet. The stings had faded a bit, but there was still the pressure of needing to go. She&#39;d started fidgeting, nobody paid attention to the back row she sat in. Just hang on a little longer, the lecture was almost over. Not that it mattered too much, but she didn&#39;t want to bother the professor with leaving early. She could just wait it out, couldn&#39;t she?<br />
<br />
The bell rang, and the students in class stood up and hurried out of the room. Jay was still busy with packing her bag. The nearest toilet was almost directly opposite to the classroom. She&#39;d only have to pass a couple of lockers and she&#39;d be there. All students had left the room, and her teacher had gone through another door leading to a storage space. Hearing the cursing and sound of objects falling, he wouldn&#39;t reenter the classroom anytime soon, as he was busy picking up some stuff.<br />
<br />
Jay had her knees make contact with each other, keeping her legs close together and trying not to make too many movements. She brought the backpack around her shoulders and started walking.<br />
<br />
She stopped at her tracks after making a couple of steps.<br />
<br />
At the first step, Jay felt as if something was being released out of her abdomen, or somewhere else.<br />
<br />
At the second step, she felt how muscles pleasurably contracted, shoving something through the tube from her birth canal.<br />
<br />
At the third step, it sounded *plop*, and an object fell down upon her panties. Jay was quite late with noticing it.<br />
<br />
At the fifth step, she heard the sound of something cracking, whilst a liquid exploded inside her pants. That was where she stopped at her tracks. <br />
<br />
The liquid was slimy, and quite a lot of it seeped down her legs. A couple of shards with sharpish edges were located in the middle of her panties. She felt them grinding against the skin between her legs.<br />
<br />
*Shit! That wasn&#39;t normal.*<br />
<br />
Jay cupped her crotch with her hands, feeling the alien liquid run over her fingers. Behind her she saw how some of the liquid had dropped to the ground in large globs. Her hands cupping her crotch caused the shards to be pressed against her skin a little harder, and the cracking noise returned for a moment as well.<br />
<br />
She heard the noise from her teacher in the storage room.<br />
<br />
*I need to get out of here, to the toilets fast!*<br />
<br />
The classroom door was still open, and Jay peeked outside to see if anyone was there.<br />
<br />
Nobody was, most had already gone off to another class, and there weren&#39;t often many lectures in this part of the building. She crossed the hallway, and pushed the door to the women&#39;s bathroom. There were two girls chatting to each other while looking in the mirror. They were too much focused on themselves and their eyeliner to pay attention to her. <br />
<br />
Jay hurried past the two students and ran into one of the bathroom stalls, locking it behind her. She examined her pants.<br />
<br />
Although they were black, they still looked like they had a faint stain on it. Running her hands over the fabric, she felt how some of the liquid had run almost down to her knees. Besides that, a couple of globs of it had dropped down to the floor underneath. She cupped her crotch again. The liquid seeping out from that region was being caught by her hands. It was oddly slimy. It was weird to compare it with her own juices, but what else could it have been? She hadn&#39;t felt like she&#39;d orgasmed though.<br />
<br />
She grabbed some toilet paper and ran it over the wet area, also cleaning her hands with it. The liquid had felt warm to the touch. The worst of the slime was gone.<br />
<br />
Jay now pulled down her pants and panties. She bit a nail at the sight. <br />
<br />
Jay&#39;s panties, completely ruined. A large yellow stain in the middle of the white fabric. A little bit more of the liquid was sliding down from the outsides of her crotch, into the toilet bowl beneath her. She heard the two girls from earlier walk out the bathroom. She was now all by herself.<br />
<br />
She grabbed another piece of paper, and ran it alongside her labia. Carefully feeling inside of her, she found her inner walls were dry. That was weird. That would mean she hadn&#39;t orgasmed after all. Then there were the shards, some of them had slid out of her panties onto her legs, sticking against them thanks to this slime. The shards, if you would call them that, seemed broken. Jay&#39;s first impression had been shards of glass, but the idea of them suddenly ending up inside her panties was nearly impossible. Better yet, anything suddenly ending up there was weird to begin with. She picked up one piece, and recognized it very quickly. <br />
<br />
*Egg shell? Have I just laid an egg?*<br />
<br />
The timing was perfect, as she let out another groan. This time it was much quicker. She hadn&#39;t noticed that the pressure in her lower belly hadn&#39;t faded, thanks to the distraction. Another *plop*, and something splattering against inside the toilet bowl, confirmed her thoughts.<br />
<br />
She just laid another egg...<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, no fucking way!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay&#39;s mind couldn&#39;t cope with this experience, it wasn&#39;t naturally possible for a human female to lay eggs, just like that. How&#39;d this even happen? The pressure seemed to have faded, she noticed, but tears had formed in her eyes in the midst of the panic. She was having a panic attack. How would anybody react to this. It felt like witchcraft. This is impossible!<br />
<br />
Jay quickly cleaned up the worst of the mess, and pulled op her panties and pants again. She headed to the Secretariat of the college, and called in sick. Now was not the time to think about school. She ran out of the building, and went straight home. She went by foot, trying to avoid as many people on public transport. The dorm wasn&#39;t more than 10 minutes away from college anyways. Most people would be working by now, there was no time for a walk for them. Jay breathed in some air through her nose, almost gagging in the process. She reeked of eggs, but wasn&#39;t exactly hungry for anything, more so she was very nauseous.<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s just hope she wouldn&#39;t come across anyone she knew on her way home.</p>
