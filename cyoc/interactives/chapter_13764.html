<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking about the Genis preyed on those who would see their lives as something of a mistake. Each person seeing themselves as a worthless being without any real value to those around them. <br />
<br />
This is when the Genie finds his favorite prey. A wish offered or two or three it is his pleasure to watch those puny humans grovel in the dust of the earth.<br />
<br />
Some ask for riches untold only to find those around them become murderously jealous.<br />
<br />
Others ask for to be in a different time and place thinking that there they might find acceptance and peace.<br />
<br />
Then even more foolhardy are those like Ken who would ask, no beg to become as some animal. As did Ken ask for the delighted life of becoming his past pet a dappled gray stallion Welsh Mountain pony.<br />
<br />
In this wish the Genis saw a human baginning away his very being and all the attributes which seperated humans from the beasts. His was to seek a simpler way of life and thus without the burdens of responsibility his would then be a life of pure enjoyment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fools!&quot; grumbled the Genie.<br />
<br />
Ken found that for him the first fourteen days was his only true paradise. During this time of learning he had watched what was his moral human lifestyle fade into the careless life of the animal.<br />
<br />
To care for the consideration of others around, being human or other animal this was all gone. Ken did as he saw fit doing whatever act or reaction came to mind. He thought with his gut instinct and lost what reasoning powers he knew as a man. <br />
<br />
His sensual pleasure was now that of standing about sniffing the breeze and wishing to be mounting a mare. A fond wish one might think accept his was to be a male and only called to being one when a mare who in need was willing and just there. Instead as with his pet he was trapped inside a barn, his stall, his small confined little world.<br />
<br />
Pleasures he might imagine were out there but bridle, stall, and fences kept him at bay. A saddle animal was he now and used for the pleasure of his owner and master. His was to be a life of personal freedoms only now he was again held in check by bonds placed there by other humans.<br />
<br />
True it was for those fourteen days as he swung his huge cock about. He liked the feel even if he could not now see or touch what had been his one big thought of beastly pleasure. Indeed to stand and masturbate himself into a wild frenzy was now his only manner of self expression.<br />
<br />
This wild desire to mate was his to know and with wilder yet hope he wish to find bestial love. His lust for masturbation soon dwindled as it lacked a final sort of satisfaction. He did it four to six times per day as his lust and instincts went wild for making love beast style.<br />
<br />
As with being human and those morale restrictions placed upon all who be human, were even in beastly form a constriction to his own free delights. <br />
<br />
If just to be naked and covered in blackened hide and dappled gray hair was not enough for Ken his was also to experience that which was to be the very essence of life in beastly of form. Cold, damp or wet, hot and sweating, dusty and dirty without anyway, thought, or ability to bathe, this was his life. The built up semen encrusted in his sheath even made him feel of filth. Let alone his laying down in a stall cleaned but once a week had him wallowing in his own manure and urine.<br />
<br />
Screaming his discomfort did little to help as humans knew not what his constant grumbling meant. Ken's only way to tell his thoughts was a body language he was just then learning and a few sounds he could muster out past lips made like of rubber.<br />
<br />
All the things which alured him into the thoughts of sensual pleasure seemed now vague. His tail was now a covering to keep nasty flies from crawling over and around his filthy unwashed asshole. His occasional loose stools made his rump a large delight for the flies! His tail swished and flicked in a never ending and constant need to ward away pests.<br />
<br />
Ken's massive pony stallion cock too had it's pleasure in being, hanging, swaying, and time after time of erections and or with masturbation. No way to stroke his delight! No way to see it! He stood looking out at whateven delighted his sight and felt what is was to be  held and contained inside this animal form. In fourteen days and as he ultimately found to be true his was a stallions life only five times in the next thirtysix coming years as a pony.<br />
<br />
Now his mane was there only for like his tail to ride him of pests. A hairy body with mobile skin he could flick it to again drive away pests. To shake the length of his huge body from head, neck, back, butt, and legs with a shudder to only alite the flies and having them return in a minute later or less. His was a life made now of personal protections from pests that licked or bite him into an itching horrid terror.<br />
<br />
Naked he was to all who might come and see him parade with his young rider. Ken felt the desire for privacy yet but as the end of those fourteen days came to and end so alos did any thought give a care to him for those around. He would sniff his female owner's personal scent. He had his own building animal instincts which bade him react with erections for almost everything and just anywhere.<br />
<br />
Hearing and understanding during those fourteen days of pony existence he knew of what people said. His was a time of embarressment and being made the fool for acting as he had long wished to be. Children would poke and prod his body as some would grab at his long hanging pony's cock. What was his and kept in private was now there for all to see and say what they wished.<br />
<br />
As his humanity waned and the end came of his human intelligence by the fourteenth day as a pony and stallion, Ken was willing to lose all rather than go on being the Fool!<br />
<br />
The Genie won once more over those who would have him bottled up. Now was his time to put mankind in their place and remind them if only for fourteen days that they had it the best when they were human.</p>
