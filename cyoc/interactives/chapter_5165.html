<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Wait a minute… how can I be so sure about all this is true? What if you’re just an crazy lady with some major malfunction in her head? If you are into magic, then would you mind giving me some proof of that?” The zoo woman’s smile disappears and her face becomes angry. “Proof!? I’ll show you some proof!!!” An invisible force grab you and throw you against the wall. You feel a sharp pain as your head bump into the wall. You sink to the floor and groan. “Now do you believe, that I’m able to use magic?” You rub the back of your head and nod slightly. “Yes, well either that or you have some kind of psychokinetic power…” The zoo woman’s face becomes friendly again, or at least friendlier. “So, how will it be?” You slowly get up on your feet. “I-I don’t know” The zoo woman’s smile now almost become impish. “Maybe this will help you decide…” She snaps her fingers. Nancy suddenly appears right in front of you. She’s wearing a nightgown and it looks like she’s in the middle of brushing her long brown hair. She freezes, and she gets a ‘what’s going on?’ expression on her face. She first looks at the zoo woman and then she sees you. <br />
<br />
“Joanne? How did I get here? Who is she?” Nancy nods in the direction of the zoo lady. “I’m your mistress, Nancy! Your friend Joanne, have just doomed you to a life as a dog” Nancy is lifted into the air, she grasp in chock and drops her hairbrush. “A dog!?” Nancy blurts out. Her nightgown is almost pulled off her body, leaving her hovering naked in the air, exposing her breast and brown pubic hair to everyone to see. “What the hell!?” Nancy looks down at herself and tries to cover her more private areas. She falls down on the floor with a thud, leaving her on her stomach on the floor. She groans as she’s able to get up on her hands and knees, but she can’t go up any further. “Joanne? What’s happening? I can’t move! I can’t move!” Nancy begins to become desperate. The Newfoundland begins to wag his tail and give his mistress a quick look to see if it’s ok for him to claim his mate. A simple nod is enough as a signal as he walks up behind the immobilized Nancy on the floor and jumps up on her back. <br />
<br />
“No! What are you doing doggie!? Bad doggie! Bad doggie!!” You feel helpless as you watch you friend desperately trying to make the big dog go away. A tear run down your chin as you know what must be done. You reach back behind your back and unbutton your bra, then let it fall to the floor. You look down at your breasts for a short moment. But Nancy’s cries remind you that you don’t have much time. The zoo lady watches you as you pull down your panties to your feet and kick them of. You quickly get down on your hands and knees in front of Nancy, just as the dog is about to claim his mate. “Come here doggie” You call, with a sad voice, on the brink of crying. The dog jumps off Nancy and walks over to you. Nancy looks at you, sad, scared and a bit surprised. “Joanne, what are you doing!?” You feel the weight of the dog on your back. “No… Joanne… you don’t have to do this…” Nancy says sobbing. “I can’t let this happen to my friend” You answer honestly as the dog tries to enter you. You close your eyes and pray to god that the whole thing will be over quickly.<br />
<br />
Nancy continues to watch her friend being humped by the dog. Without even noticing it she sits down and buries her face into her hands. After a few seconds she realizes that she can move again, stands up and puts on her nightgown. She watches her friend’s breasts sway from the thrusts and see that Joanne is beginning to sweat from the performance. “Why are you doing this?” Nancy asks the zoo lady without even looking at her. “Let’s just say that I breed different dog breeds and I need a Newfoundland bitch so I can get some Newfoundland puppies” Nancy continues to watch the mating with horror filled fascination. “So you mean Joanne is going to give birth to Newfoundland puppies? How is that possible?”<br />
<br />
The Zoo lady sighs. “She’s going to become a Newfoundland bitch… don’t you listen? I mean you could have been in Joanne’s place right now” Nancy tries to get a grip of the new information she’s getting and to forget what’s happening to her friend. “Why don’t you just use normal dog? Why do you destroy people’s life, by transforming them into dogs?” Nancy looks the zoo lady with upset eyes. The four eyes meet each other. “Because puppies that come from two transformed humans are smarter then normal puppies, transforming humans also helps rare breeds by giving them new gene material” Nancy take her eye’s from the zoo lady and focus her eyes on the brown Newfoundland instead. “You mean, he was a human before?” The zoo lady nods and smiles as if she suddenly remembers a happy memory. “Yeah, his name is Riley. He is… or was an ordinary 18 year old boy when I found him. He had somehow sneaked into the kennel where I work during the night. When started working the next morning I found him, sleeping on one of the sofas with some of my dogs. He pleaded me not to call the police. He had escaped from his foster family and he did not want to go back. So I offered him to stay with me and accepted without a second though. But of course I didn’t say anything about transforming him into a Newfoundland at that time. But that didn’t matter, he told me he loves dogs and he didn’t seem to mind becoming a dog when it was time to change him. And now he’s one of my favorite dogs!”<br />
<br />
The zoo lady points at Joanne and Riley as his thrusts begins to become more frequent. “Look! Soon he will be done and when he squirts his seed into her. She will change so she will be fitted to be the mother of his puppies” Nancy curses herself, why haven’t she done anything to prevent it? She has to do something and fast. Just as she’s about to rush forward and try to stop the male from humping, an extraordinary force throws her to the other side of the room, knocking her unconscious. The zoo lady smiles a superior smile and looks at the unconscious Nancy “Bad move, Nancy…”<br />
<br />
Your back is beginning to really ache from the weight of the dog on top of you. His pumping begins to quicken making your body heat to go wild. You know in the back of your head that he’s soon going to release his seed and you prepare yourself for the end. You watch your breast sway of the thrusts and they almost hit your face because of the dogs powerful thrusting. A loud thud startles you and turns your attention away from meeting his thrusts. You see Nancy lying unconscious on the other side of the room. But this quickly passes your mind as it’s consumed by the pleasure filled horror you’re experiencing. Suddenly it all ends as he makes a final powerful thrust and shudders slightly and you can feel his muscles tensing. Something warm spreading inside of you. He relaxes again, lying panting on your back. You feel that your breathing is faster then normal and it’s both because you’re exhausted and because of your fear of what’s about to come. The zoo lady walks up next to you, but she’s obviously not interested in talking, at least not with you. “Are you done Riley?” The dog looks up at his mistress face and pants rapidly. He looks satisfied enough. “Good, then I’ll help you to get out of her so she can get some room” You weakly look up at the zoo lady, she look back at you with a contented smile on her face. She walks up behind the two of you, you try to look back and see what she’s doing but you can’t get a good view of it. You can feel your Riley’s shrink inside of you and he begins to pull out. Riley whines softly as he begins to back away and get ready to dismount. You feel relieved he’s out of you, pulled out with a last yank and you are even more relieved because of the weight that has been taken off your back as he dismounts. <br />
<br />
You collapse on the floor, you stop your head from hitting the floor by resting it on your arms. You feel your breasts being pressed against the parquet floor of your apartment. You breathe heavily, waiting for anything to happen. You don’t have to wait for long. An electrical pulse rush through you, you watch as it makes every hair on your body stand erect. No, they are not just standing up… they are growing… and new ones grow besides them. You get up on your feet, but you can’t get your eyes off your arms as you’re fascinated by the black pelt of hair that now covers your arms and hands. You put down your arms and let them rest along your sides. “No…” You whimper and cover your mouth with a hand as you discover the same growing amount of fur on your chest, stomach and your legs. “Look Riley! She’s growing fur! You’re going to be a daddy! I’m so PROUD of you!” The Zoo lady praises Riley as if she was rewarding him for doing a trick. At the same time you begin to feel an invisible force pull the end of your spine, and as if it were a rubber band you feel it become longer. You don’t even look back as you don’t have to be an Einstein to figure out what has begun to grow out of your body. A few seconds later someone begins to pull out your mouth and nose, you also feel the bones inside your nose crack as it becomes more upright to make it easier to smell and track. Something grabs your ears and pulls them, making them longer and slowly raising them higher up on your head. You are amazed of the speed of the changes. You grab your breasts with your stiffening, shortened and chubby fingers. They feel as you expected them to, they feel flatter and not at all as big and soft as they used to be. You slowly run your hands down your furry stomach and feel the two rows of nipples below your breasts. You look back to take a quick look how the growth of your tail is going. <br />
<br />
At first it hard to believe that you have a tail, but the truth becomes obvious when you are able to wag the furry extension of your tailbone growing just above your furry ass. You suddenly realize that your muzzle has grown so long that it has begun to block your view. You put your hands to your face with some difficulty as they have begun to become much less flexible then before. You hold your hands in front of you and shudders at their resemblance to dog paws. Your thumbs belongs to the past and your nails looks more like small black claws now. You begin to feel your face to see if there still is something human about it. But the search is fruitless, as it almost feels like any other dog face. To make the whole thing even worse you feel that your fingers have grown soft pads, adapting them so they can be used for walking. They feel kind of nice but, not very human. Without really noticing it, your posture has changed to a more forward leaning position. “If you want to say goodbye to your friend, you should do so before your vocal chords becomes adapted for barking” Advices the zoo lady. You decide to follow her advice as begin to feel that you don’t have a lot of time as a human left. You understand this because you feel your skull being squashed and remolded and your upper lip have begun grow downwards. As you walk towards Nancy with uneasy steps your upper lip grows so long that even cowers your lower jaw and lip. You begin to doubt that you have any resemblance with the human you were just a few minutes ago. <br />
<br />
The balance change, throwing you more or less involuntary onto all fours in front of Nancy. The landing also helps your ears to tip over and fold so they can become normal Newfoundland ears. You look back at your body and see that you still have some more changes to go, your hind legs are unnaturally long for a dog, making your lower body stick up into the air. Maybe there still is time to say goodbye. You try to call her name, but the tongue in your mouth is no longer the tongue of a human but the large tongue of a Newfoundland making it impossible to form words. You are not even able to get out a vaguely recognizable word. But still, you have to say goodbye… somehow. Without really thinking about it you give Nancy a couple of wet licks in her face. She groans and begins to regain conscious, she looks at you with half open eyes and you feel a single tear roll down, making a wet path trough the fur on your chin. Her eyes slowly open. “Joanne? Is that you?” She asks weakly. You try to say yes, but it ends up as a whine. “Oh, my god… what has she done with you, Joanne?” Nancy asks in shock and in sorrow. She gets up on her knees and hugs you and you join her in a sitting position. She buries her face in your fur and cries. You carefully put your paws on her shoulders, trying to hug back as much as possible.<br />
“It’s time to go now Joanne…” The zoo lady says. Nancy suddenly realizes to her surprise that she’s hugging air. “Where did Joanne go!?” Nancy cries out. “She has gone home along with her mate. Now it’s time for you to forget about everything you that has happened. Then I’ll be on my way too” Nancy’s sorrow begins to be replaced by anger. “FORGET!? How can I forget that my…” She trails off when she tries to remember what she couldn’t forget and how the hell she got into Joanne’s apartment and why have she only got a nightgown on her? “Joanne?” Nancy calls out. She desperately begins to search the apartment, but she’s nowhere to be found. “Where is she?” Nancy asks herself as the only company she’s got is an empty apartment.</p>
