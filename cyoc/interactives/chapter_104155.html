<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite of Joshua&#39;s embarrassment, the dick size contest began. But, Vincent thought it was unfair for Nick and Kenny to compete against him, Luke and Randy. Joshua&#39;s new tool was enough big to compete and although Raul&#39;s dick was still in a kid&#39;s shape, it was too big anyway.<br />
Ok... Let&#39;s do this quickly! Luke said. I don&#39;t feel comfortable doing this.<br />
Don&#39;t try to fool us&quot; Randy said. I know you had a girlfriend last year! Don&#39;t say me you didn&#39;t fuck her!<br />
Hey! Don&#39;t speak like that in front of the kids! Luke complained. And to your information. I didn&#39;t<br />
Well... If you didn&#39;t, at least I&#39;m sure you masturbate. Vincent said. Everybody does!<br />
Yeah! Kenny said. I do! Jezz Joshua, I wish I had your body to do it right now!<br />
You didn&#39;t say that if you had to deal with this embarrassment! Joshua said. Damn! It was too unexpected that I don&#39;t know what to do!<br />
Hey! Randy said. You must be happy! I had to wait for years to get this amount of body hair and you get it in a few minutes! You won&#39;t have to worry about puberty... but I think we&#39;ll need to talk about another things...<br />
Come on! Raul yelled. Let&#39;s do this and move on to something else. I&#39;m sick of this!<br />
Of what? Randy grinned. Of us? or yourself? Maybe you&#39;re scared of becoming like Josh.&quot; He took Joshua&#39;s left arm and he lift it up. Look these bushes! I bet you&#39;ll have your own soon!<br />
Hey! Joshua replied. Don&#39;t do that! He lowered his arm. I&#39;m tired of showing my armpits at every time you want.<br />
Ok! Randy said. I can show this instead. He said and pulled some pubes from Joshua&#39;s crotch. Joshua cried as he had never felt something like that before and it was too painful. I can lend you some of my underwear but I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t be able to hide this wildness if you don&#39;t shave it! It&#39;s a mess!<br />
Kenny looked at his own crotch wishing he could have some pubes too.<br />
Ok! Vincent said. No more talking. Let&#39;s do this! You know what to do, right?<br />
Yeah, yeah... Luke said. To get our dicks erect and then measure them.<br />
Randy and Vincent started almost at the moment they said the competition began, Luke and Raul gasped and then they began too. The only one who wasn&#39;t sure about doing it was Joshua who was looking at his dick instead. It&#39;s huge,  Can I hold it with my hands? Will it feel different?<br />
What are you doing?!! Kenny cried. Do it, Joshua! Or you will lose!<br />
Joshua saw at Kenny&#39;s direction. He was way smaller than him now. Joshua was sure he can&#39;t even reach his shoulders height. Then, he looked at his arms, they were bigger, stronger, different, unconfortable but not unpleasent. His hands were bigger too, enough to handle the salami he had on his groin. He saw at his brother, he was almost full erect. His dick looks like a horse&#39;s dick. Would his own get that size too? He started to touch his pole, it was flaccid but firm like rubber it was long as a pipe, he needed to move his hands up and down way longer than with younger dick. And then, he began to feel it. Blood pumping through the dick, making it harder as time passed. This feeling was familiar to him, he had felt it before but never as intense as now. It was a complete ecstasy. Now, he understood why his brother liked too much to fuck girls, it must be way more better inside of a warm pussy than this cold water.<br />
Ok, now all of us are ready. Vincent said but he saw that Joshua was lost in his own. Hey kid! It&#39;s enough!<br />
When Joshua heard Vincent calling him a kid, he recovered himself. He was right, he still was a kid. A very hairy, tall, muscled and manly... But a kid in mind, were those older guy&#39;s feelings taking control of him? He didn&#39;t want that happens.<br />
I&#39;ll be the judge. Kenny said. At least I could feel how meaty are your penises.<br />
It sounds so gay. Randy said. But, I like you so I&#39;ll ignore that. I&#39;m sure that you would be a way more fun dude than Joshua. He can&#39;t handle growing up.<br />
Nick smiled and he began to measure each dick. They were as long as his arm, from shoulder to middle finger tip, but nothing of them were bigger or smaller than that.<br />
They are the same... Nick said. Except for Raul&#39;s. Sorry, pal but you&#39;re some inches smaller.<br />
Sorry?! Raul said. I wish it will be way more smaller!<br />
So? Luke said. No one won?<br />
I told you! Nick said. Your dicks are the same. Maybe it&#39;s because of their unnatural provenance.<br />
This is bullshit! Randy yelled. At least it will catch some chicks. Joshy, I&#39;ll give you a few too, so you&#39;ll be more accustomed to use your tool.<br />
Joshua just gasped, red face as his stiff dick becomes soft again.<br />
Ok. This is over. Luke said. I&#39;m tired of all of this. I want to get out of this pool.<br />
But I think you love pools! Vincent said.<br />
Yes. But, to swim. Luke said. Not being naked, freaks and with mutations... I want to go home.<br />
Ok, then go! Randy said. But I&#39;m not sure if you can drive your bike without clothing and with that bouncing salami with you.<br />
Then, lend me something to wear! Luke said.<br />
I don&#39;t know if I have something that big, but we can look for it. Randy said. Hey? Why don&#39;t you stay with me and Vincent? He&#39;ll stay here all weekend and I don&#39;t care to see you going around with that dick uncovered.<br />
I&#39;m not sure. Luke said. I prefer to go home. But, thinking about what you said I think it&#39;s better that I stayed at least until tomorrow.<br />
Yeii!! Kenny said. Teacher will stay! We&#39;ll have a good time together!<br />
Together? Randy said. I don&#39;t want kids around me. You can have your own place but I won&#39;t you near to us, to the grow ups!<br />
Kenny was dissapointed but Randy&#39;s look was too intimidating to argue.<br />
Then, let&#39;s get out of this pool! Joshua said.<br />
All guys got out of the pool. They didn&#39;t take towels so they walked back to the house completely wet. Randy, Vincent and Luke went to the right and Raul, Nick and Kenny were going to the left. But Joshua was standing in front of the pool.<br />
Joshua? Raul said. What are you waiting?<br />
Everybody turned back to look.<br />
Come on, bro! Randy said. You must be with the big guys! He flexed his arms and his armpits were revealed.<br />
Joshua saw himself. His body was similar to his brother&#39;s one, big, muscled, hairy... but he wanted to stay with his friends. He wasn&#39;t sure where to go. He took a big sigh and then he decided.</p>
