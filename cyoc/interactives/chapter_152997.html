They had made enough money that all their relatives back home were well and Madame Illusia herself went back to the land she came from.<br />
<br />
But Stephan, now 25, wasn&#39;t ready to return home. He liked the city-life and got an apartment. He still did magic acts to pay his bills but he didn&#39;t show off his magic so blatantly anymore. Now, most of his shows were just common stage magic type stuff but every once in a while, he did a special show in which he held nothing back, in which he let the audience know that he was a real magician. He only did these special shows in select places, places that were not open to the general public so Stephan could ensure that no little kids or bigoted assholes could get in.<br />
<br />
See when Illusia was around, Stephan felt stifled. Yea Illusia attracted gay men but Illusia herself was neither male nor giving gay men what they really came to see, hot, sexy, naked men. Stephan wanted to change all that.<br />
<br />
Tonight was one of Stephan&#39;s special shows. He had a small stage in a bar that held maybe eighty people. Although it was a gay friendly bar, people didn&#39;t have to be gay to enter. They just had to be gay friendly. The place was relatively classy. It had a Spartan aesthetic as there were no fancy or expensive decorations but the colors were light blue and white not black and the place was well lit as they usually had male strippers.<br />
<br />
After the bartender introduced his act, Stephan came out on stage wearing his stage magic outfit. &quot;Thank you, thank you all. Now gentlemen and others, some of you may be groaning to see a stage magician instead of your usual stripper. I can assure you that you will still be entertained. Let me begin by showing you that I have nothing up my sleeve.&quot; With that, Stephan ripped the sleeves off his arms and threw them into the audience. He raised both his bare arms showing them off. This had worked to get the audiences attention. They still weren&#39;t sure if they would be entertained or not but seeing Stephan&#39;s bare arms suggested that there might be more to see in this magic act.<br />
<br />
Stephan then just kind of danced around doing minor tricks like pulling cards from behind his ear until as he expected, the audience began to lose interest. &quot;Are you still not convinced that I&#39;m doing real magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
One man shouted, &quot;It&#39;s just like any other magic show.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephan decided that man would be his target. &quot;What do I need to do to prove that I have nothing up my sleeve? Can&#39;t you see that I have no sleeves covering my sexy bare arms?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man shouted, &quot;You still have your shirt on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephan said, &quot;Why so I have. I better remedy that.&quot; and in one swift motion, he yanked his entire shirt off and threw it at the man leaving himself bare chested. Then he went back to doing simple magic tricks but focused on doing magic around his shoes.<br />
<br />
Someone else caught on and started shouting, &quot;Lose the shoes. Lose the shoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephan pretended to be flustered and said, &quot;I&#39;m busy doing magic. Would someone volunteer to help me with my shoes?&quot;<br />
<br />
A young man ran forward to grab the shoes. Stephan&#39;s socks naturally went with the shoes but Stephan pushed the man back before he grabbed Stephan&#39;s pants. Instead, Stephan put his hands in his pockets and used his feet to do some magic tricks for the audience. He had the audiences full attention now and the bartender signaled that people were staying for the show and buying more beer.<br />
<br />
Stephan turned back to the man he chose to target. &quot;Now are you convinced that I am a real magician?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not a magician. You&#39;re just a stripper doing stupid parlor tricks. You&#39;ve got stuff hidden under your pants so lose them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephan said, &quot;Now really, I am a respectable gentleman. Are you really going to insist that I prove my magic to you by taking my pants off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephan got the crowd started in a chant saying, &quot;Take it off, take it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephan said, &quot;Very well&quot; and yanked his pants off to reveal a very skimpy thong with a big bulge. He went back to dancing and doing basic tricks.<br />
<br />
The bar usually didn&#39;t strip further than this. The bar owner established that full monty should be a rare treat but he wouldn&#39;t advertise if a stripper would go full monty so that the crowd would always wonder if they would get some full monty tonight or not. So Stephan stayed in his thong dancing until he saw that the crowd had given up their anticipation.<br />
<br />
Just before people started to leave, Stephan announced, &quot;Oh silly me, you aren&#39;t impressed by my simple tricks but if I want to do bigger magic, I need my wand. Now where did I put my wand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephan pretended to bumble around looking for his wand for a moment before announcing, &quot;Of course, how silly of me to forget. My wand is right here.&quot; and he yanked off his thong and threw it.<br />
<br />
However, everyone was puzzled because they expected that a big cock had been making that big bulge but what they saw was a teensy, tiny little cock.<br />
<br />
While everyone was still puzzled, Stephan asked, &quot;What happened to my wand? It shrank? Maybe I should have used it so vigorously last night. Also, doesn&#39;t it feel a little chilly in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few people chuckled.<br />
<br />
Stephan said, &quot;I suppose I better fix it. Xonalite Nanalite Operalite Boot.&quot; This was just gibberish to sound like magic words that Stephan spoke as he held his hands out like he was casting a spell. He vibrated wearing nothing but his collar, belt, and gloves. The audience didn&#39;t want him to actually be naked. They just wanted to see his big wand and his wand did grow big. It didn&#39;t just grow from an erection which Stephan willed himself to have. It also just simply grew until it was sixteen inches long. His balls grew too.<br />
<br />
For those who had never seen his show before which was most of this crowd, this was the moment they became amazed because there was no way for his cock to grow that much. They began to applaud.<br />
<br />
But Stephan wasn&#39;t done yet. He yanked his cock off and waved it in the air saying, &quot;Thank you, thank you.&quot; The crowd was stunned to see that Stephan stood there with his balls between his legs but no cock attached.<br />
<br />
Stephan than brought a few boxes from back stage and announced, &quot;For my next trick, I need a volunteer.&quot;</p>
