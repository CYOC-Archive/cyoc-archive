<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha let the air she&#39;d been holding in since she and William had arrived at the hospital. Neither of them knew Huck personally. They were too new to Moon Lake to have ever needed construction options that would have brought them into contact with Huck, but the connections through the Skulk and through Jenny and Harry had been more than enough to get both of them willing to check on Jenny and Harry to make sure that they were okay. Martha might only be an honorary member, but despite the Skulk&#39;s more formal attitude toward many of its actions, she also agreed with the care that its members seemed to give each other. She&#39;d also seen the love that Harry and Jenny had and wanted to see the two of them be happy forever. That had made her more than willing want to see things get better for Harry and Jenny and for the Jenkins family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad everything will be fine...&quot; Martha said slowly as she opened the passenger door to the car.<br />
<br />
William sat down behind the steering wheel and nodded in agreement, &quot;the idea that Henry Jr. and Ms. Betty realized they loved other was also nice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way... but it&#39;d better if they didn&#39;t have to do so in a hospital,&quot; Martha pointed out.<br />
<br />
Again William nodded in agreement, but commented, &quot;maybe, but better late than never.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha really couldn&#39;t contest that as William began to drive back home. She watched as buildings and trees and lamp posts past by as he drove along. William continued as they drove along.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the big thing is that this agent was caught and is cooperating,&quot; William commented, &quot;that&#39;ll give Harry and Jenny a shot a happy wedding... or at least having less interference.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there is that,&quot; Martha again agreed but found herself shivering slightly at the memory of what that agent had done that morning. She cared greatly for Harry and Jenny and was glad that things worked out for the Jenkins family, but she couldn&#39;t shake the fear that she&#39;d felt when the Middle School went into lock-down. Memories of the news reports on places lie Columbine or Sandy Hook or even Virginia Tech kept flashing through her mind where troubled students or troubled people went into these schools and shoot up the place for revenge or something that not even the best psychologist could ever figure out. It was something that she never wanted to experience as she was fearful she couldn&#39;t protect her students and that she wouldn&#39;t know how to tell parents that children in her care had been killed. Martha had thought she&#39;d gotten over all this shock and fear, but the fact that this agent of Dieter Wilhelm had been the cause of it was enough to bring it back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha?&quot; William&#39;s voice suddenly, to Martha&#39;s perception, asked her. She looked over to see him fully focused on her and that the car was in park. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
By this point she looked around to see that they had made it back to their own home. She&#39;d been nervously thinking of her fears the whole way home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m okay,&quot; Martha sighed after a moment as she moved to climb out of the car, &quot;this whole think with the Jenkins... it... it reminded me of the whole incident at the school today...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, of course,&quot; William nodded as he walked around the car and placed a hand on her shoulder. He felt that her shoulder muscles were very tense, just from the touch, &quot;the school took its safety steps when the agent fled by the school and was caught in the area. Thankfully, he did no harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Martha said, &quot;But it still scared me...&quot;<br />
<br />
William glanced to his wife as he opened the door and he seemed to feel her fear and tension radiating off of her over the issue. He understood her having some fears, but at the same time he couldn&#39;t let his mate go to bed feeling tense and stressed because of fears of someone invading the school she was in. That was something that he would have to be fixed in the only way William knew. He shut the door behind them as they entered and then locked the door behind them. Once the door was locked the two moved up the stairs and toward their bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things will get better,&quot; William said to her as they made their way toward their bedroom and began to rub her shoulders. He could feel the tension there and made him focus on that that at first. &quot;And you were safe...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if he&#39;d come in the school?&quot; Martha asked as she looked over her shoulder to William, liking the massage he was giving her as they entered the bedroom. &quot;What if he&#39;d made direct threats to the students... and what if I couldn&#39;t protect them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would never happen,&quot; William answered and he rubbed her shoulders and then lifted her arms up from underneath to give Martha some look at her own toned biceps. They were no where near Kat&#39;s size, but they were bigger than they&#39;d been before she became a werecat. &quot;My werecat is too strong for some lunatic trying to sneak into the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha looked back and soon felt William kiss and nibble at her neck and as William&#39;s hands wrapped around her. His fingertips were first to set on rubbing her belly, and that soon to get other sensations going.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmmmmm,&quot; Martha gave a low moan, &quot;William...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve seemed stressed and frustrated,&quot; William answered as he began to transform, his eyes going from brown to his red werefox eyes, &quot;and needlessly. You&#39;re strong and beautiful and no child would ever be in danger with you there to look after them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha watched as William&#39;s fur grew out on his face, most of it being the typical red orange color the Red Fox. She also watched as his ears became triangular and moved to the top of his head. She could also feel the soft caress of his claws growing out from his fingertips as he continued to massage Martha&#39;s body, even if through her clothing. He also continued to slowly nibble at her neck and shoulders, more to tickle her than anything else and since his transformation into a werefox, Martha found that his actions were quiet pleasurable. She found herself rapidly beginning to grow wet.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is how you fight stress, my werefox?&quot; Martha asked and began to transform as well. Her arousal was growing rapidly and she knew she wouldn&#39;t be able to fight it soon, even if she wanted to.<br />
<br />
Her body grew warm as her own brown fur began to cover her. To protect against &quot;overheating&quot; she began to walk forward and disrobe, even as her fingernails lengthened into recurved and sharp claws. She felt rather lucky in that she didn&#39;t do any damage to her clothing as she transformed. She kicked off her shoes and noticed that William was doing the same as they rose up onto their lengthening feet that made their digitigrade stance as weres.  She watched William smile with his narrow vulpine muzzle, which soon brought a smile to her own rounded feline muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; William came toward her and caressed her breasts as they came together and Martha gave an aroused moan as he freed her E cup breasts from the fabric prison that the sports bra she was wearing was. She watched as his long white tipped red orange tail grew out behind him and swayed behind him. Martha also licked her muzzle in anticipation as William had already removed his pants and she could clearly see his huge erection standing tall between his legs from his sheath. He continued to smile to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve felt tense and nervous over what happened this morning,&quot; William continued to say to Martha, &quot;and I&#39;ve found that this has made my strong and sexy wife happy and confident.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two closed for a kiss, which they managed with their muzzles. William reached up with his hands to softly massage her breasts as they compressed between the two of them as they met while Martha moved to pull down her panties as her long brown furred tail blossomed out behind her, twitching quickly as she felt the pleasure build in her until she quite literally meowed in orgasm from the stimulation he&#39;d given her. It was something she&#39;d really liked about William becoming a werefox was that he seemed to instinctively know every little trick needed to get the most pleasure out of her, and in a way it did exactly as William had just said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Martha smiled and nuzzled her muzzle to William&#39;s, &quot;it certainly does make me happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two kissed again as William lay Martha back onto their shared bed, and shortly after, Martha felt William&#39;s erect member painlessly slide into her vagina. It only stopped when he got to his knot, but even there, Martha knew what was thrust into her was longer what normal human men could attain and was thicker than what normal human men could attain. That made her purr in happiness and contentment as she brought her own thrusts to counter her husband&#39;s as she could feel her body building toward another orgasm. She was fairly certain that the stress she felt was loosening.</p>
