<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty heard the heavy footsteps thudding on the stairs and turned sharply to stare in panic at his barricaded door. He had willed 2x4&#39;s, nails, and a heavy lock onto the door. The handle turned, he gasped desperately as he finished getting dressed and threw the last of his belongings into a backpack.<br />
<br />
Something slammed heavily into the door and it barely budged. Ty removed his window screen and felt himself breaking into full blown panic.<br />
<br />
The wood on the door, the lock, and what was holding it vanished in a blink. The door flew open and Ty screamed before he could jump out the window.<br />
<br />
A pissed off seven foot tall raptor woman stood in the doorway and shot daggers toward Ty with her slitted reptilian pupils. Her eyes narrow, she snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Please!&quot; Ty whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t even dream of what you just tried to do to me.&quot; June whispered. Her speech was perfect, her strange undeveloped dialect was gone completely. Her mind had raised back to human intelligence and comprehension.<br />
<br />
Ty stood up beside the open window and eyed it nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead.&quot; June motioned, waving a claw dismissively, a diabolical smirk on her snout. Her tail swung behind her slowly.<br />
<br />
Without a thought, Ty grabbed the window frame and catapulted himself out. He slammed face first into a solid brick wall that had just appeared and fell to his bedroom floor in a heap. As he saw the brick, he willed it to vanish. It didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t reverse or alter anything I do. Or me. Ever again.&quot; The raptor smirked wider.<br />
<br />
Ty turned suddenly, livid, and willed her to shrink in size. The raptor put her hand on her hip and smiled with full teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t even feel it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty tried harder, giving it everything he had, and willed June to shrink!<br />
<br />
The raptor crossed her arms over her now shapely chest and tapped her foot. Nothing. Not even a feather out of place.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder, though...&quot; June raised a hand and tapped her snout mockingly. &quot;Have you learned how to do the same thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty gasped and stood up again, about to plead for mercy as he felt a hard jolt rock his body. From his perspective, the raptor and indeed the world itself grew in size. He had shrunken! He was shrinking! Ty raised his hands up and looked over himself in absolute terror as he found he had lost humanity. He was becoming a velociraptor fast! With another jolt, he tried to scream and try to reason with his former step mom. He could only manage grunts and screeches as he found it harder and harder to even form words in his mind.<br />
<br />
NO! NO! He tried to hold on desperately, looking up at June&#39;s satisfied grin of razor teeth, and found he was completely helpless. Whatever she had learned to do in her last moments before she changed back into a full dinosaur, Ty had no ability to do himself.<br />
<br />
He felt his mind shrinking. Experienced memories being torn away and forgotten. He let out a screech of agony, completely helpless, and knew he was moments from losing everything that made him Ty. He was dumbing down, losing his intelligence, his reason, his ability to think. His self. In a horrible final moment, Ty felt regret and remorse. He just wanted it to stop. He shuddered, feeling all of his identity slipping away, and felt sudden gut wrenching terror as a new self began to form. One run by primal instincts and the need for survival. He was overcome by ancient reptilian urges. Eat. Run. Hunt. Fuck. Eat. Run. Hunt. Fuck. Ty was lost.<br />
<br />
June relented. Her smirk grew wider. Ty felt himself flood back and staggered as his body returned to human, cinching up his saggy clothes as he refilled them with his original form and shooting back up to his pre-dinosaur self.<br />
<br />
He collapsed to his knees panting and felt the hot flush of sweaty fear and shame overtaking his face.<br />
<br />
The raptor growled and nodded. &quot;So you see what it was like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, June!&quot; Ty staggered, crawling forward and throwing himself at her ankles, grabbing the exposed scales and crying hysterically. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s only one problem.&quot; The raptor knelt down, grinning. &quot;I&#39;m not June anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty managed to look up through the tears and the sting of his bloodshot eyes and gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, your step mother is well and truly gone, just as you intended. As is your step father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What do you...&quot; Ty wiped his eyes and fell back in exhaustion. The fresh feeling of losing his entire self, his entire ability to think, his comprehension, his consciousness, his very thinking human mind... it was still horrifying.<br />
<br />
&quot;June and I have become one. When I returned to this body I took back all of her memories and knowledge. I&#39;m just the dinosaur now. June doesn&#39;t even exist. Neither does Mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My God.&quot; Ty whispered, staring up at the dinosaur in awe. &quot;So...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the consequences of your actions.&quot; June crossed her arms again and snorted defiantly. &quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere, and I&#39;m so much more now than what you intended me to be. Take a few minutes to clean yourself up, Ty. Then come downstairs and the four of us will have a little talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The four of us?&quot; Ty realized. Oh shit! She meant Dustin! Er, Darcy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like Mark and I, Dustin no longer exists either. I released him from what you did, too. You&#39;ll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
June turned, grabbed the door handle with her tail, and slammed it behind her. Ty was alone to his thoughts.</p>
