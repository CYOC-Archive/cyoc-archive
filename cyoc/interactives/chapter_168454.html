<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time midnight rolled around and Leah&#39;s mother returned from her shift at the hospital,  Lead and Eric had erased all traces of their games together. Leah was passed-out in bed and Eric panned out on the couch, exhausted.<br />
<br />
Abigail, Leah&#39;s mother, worked in the same hospital and shift as Eric&#39;s own mother; the two mothers had been friends since starting work together, and it was how the two families knew each other.<br />
<br />
Once home Abigail thanked Eric and he made his way back home.<br />
<br />
His room looked messy when he entered it, but he was so exhausted and drained he just collapsed on his bed and fell asleep within moments.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Eric awoke with a grunt the next morning. Groggily he sat up and and rolled over, finding a patch of wet, cold bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; He wiped his hand on it and brought it to his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurk...&quot; he whipped it away. It reeked of cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw fuck... must have had a wet dream last night&quot;. He sat up hands feeling the wet mattress again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus... there&#39;s loads. And I don&#39;t even remember a dream.&quot; He frowned. This horsecock clearly had a mind of it&#39;s own, he thought, not knowing it was rat cum he was sitting in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfff&quot; he blew out, &quot;better clean the lot... and get rid of this thing&quot; he looked down at the horsecock dangling by his leg.<br />
<br />
It took Eric a good half hour to strip and wash everything from the bed, and to scrub the stains everywhere. <br />
<br />
Sweating he finished and said. &quot;Right. Time to make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again!&quot;. He turned to the chronivac...<br />
<br />
...only. Where was it!? There was his desktop, and where was the chronivac?<br />
<br />
His stomach dropped through his pants as he looked around, not seeing it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again to Lisa&#39;s script, anyone looking for the chronivac would only see a desktop computer and think it was Eric&#39;s. To Eric, this translated that somehow, the chronivac wasn&#39;t there anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck...&quot; he moaned after some frantic searching.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
&quot;Just gone?&quot; Leah repeated, incredulous. &quot;Vanished!?&quot;. She threw her hands up in a magicians *poof* gesture.<br />
<br />
Eric buried his face in his hands, mortified. &quot;Yeah...&quot; he mumbled, &quot;the Chronivac has disappeared.&quot;  Leah made a grimace in response and sat back on her crossed legs. <br />
<br />
Several days later, Eric&#39;s first back babysitting Leah while her mother&#39;s worked, and no sign of the Chronivac still; or, more accurately, Eric still couldn&#39;t see it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what. You just have to wait for. Ehm. That...&quot; Leah waved her hand at his general crotch direction, &quot;...to wear off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s mouth twisted, &quot;That&#39;s the thing Leah, I&#39;m not sure it does wear off...&quot;<br />
<br />
She snorted a laugh, then caught herself. &quot;Sorry. So you have to get a new one? They expensive?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nonplussed responded, &quot;Sort of a one time thing. They don&#39;t send multiples. If you lose one, that&#39;s it. They don&#39;t send more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that means. You&quot; she bubbled a laugh, snorting again. &quot;Sorry sorry! But you. My boyfriend. Has a horses wiener for the foreseeable future.&quot; She stated.<br />
<br />
Eric looked her dead in the eye, their gaze held for a moment until Leah&#39;s face cracked into a grin; then she laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahahahah! Horse wiener!&quot; She pointed, rolling aroundnin laughter. Eric&#39;s face fell, clearly unimpressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww&quot; she stopped, still grinning and stifling giggles. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Eric! But... it&#39;s a little funny, you have to admit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not...&quot; he harrumphed. She snickered, &quot;It is a bit though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is not!&quot; He responded, a bit more forceful. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is too!&quot; She wasn&#39;t going to let him sulk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is not! How are we supposed to be together if I can&#39;t...&quot; he caught himself and stopped.<br />
<br />
Leah caught the tone and stopped laughing, instead, gently and lovingly asking. &quot;Can&#39;t what, Eric?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This thing&#39;ll never fit! With you I mean. How&#39;s that going to work...&quot; he lamented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey...&quot;she started. Reaching out and taking his larger hand in her small one, squeezing it. &quot;I don&#39;t care if we can&#39;t do that. There&#39;s plenty else that we can do.&quot; <br />
<br />
She stood up, grasping his cheeks, leaning down and giving him a big, over exaggerated kiss on the mouth. &quot;Like using that mouth of yours on me again!&quot; She winked, stepping back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about what we did all week!&quot; She was talking fast and nervous as she began fumbling with the buckles of her dark blue pinafore.<br />
<br />
*clack*<br />
<br />
&quot;How it felt! I&#39;ve never felt anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
*clack* the second buckle came loose. And with a *fflumph* the pinafore slid from her hitting the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean I&#39;ve felt tingly before. But never, that.&quot; With skinny dark legs she stepped out of the pool of dress. Her tone betrayed her excitement talking about what they&#39;d done.<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried it myself during the week, with my hands, but it wasn&#39;t the same. Couldn&#39;t get it right!&quot;<br />
<br />
She wiggled her fingers, then used them to pull her yellow tee over her head, revealing the flat chest and puffy nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been looking forward to you coming over all week!&quot; She grabbed her panties and bending over dropped them down to fully strip.<br />
<br />
Standing up she grinned at the doofy look on Eric&#39;s face and put her hands behind her back, sticking out her hips, swinging from side to side.<br />
<br />
Eric was practically drooling. How quickly Leah had become comfortable with being naked in front of him, the confidence of youth he figured. He wondered if she harboured an exhibitionist streak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weeeelll&quot; she sang, &quot;are you just going to stare at me!? Or are you going to get busy?&quot; She raised her eyebrow, seductively, placing her hands on her hips and thrusting her pelvis out again.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s funk was quickly evaporating. This sexy little minx clearly wasn&#39;t bothered by his unfortunate development, and she was begging him to have some fun. <br />
<br />
&quot;How could I refuse!?&quot; He smiled at last. Closing the distance, her legs trembled in excitement and she wobbled a little as she spread her stance.<br />
<br />
Eric stopped then and offered. &quot;You know Leah, you can lie down on your back if you want. It&#39;d help take the load of your legs and gives me better access.&quot;<br />
<br />
He could see a run of embarrassment run over her face from her obvious inexperience. &quot;Yeah? Okay. If you think it helps...&quot;<br />
<br />
She sat then lay down on the floor perfectly flat staring up at him. Eric snickered, kneeled beside her, gently kissing her lips and pulling back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lift your legs babe&quot; one went straight up in the air and he gently caught it and shuffled around to her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Like this.&quot;  Carefully he brought her knees up and then spread her legs wide. As he did he could feel the warmth of her again, and her scent tickled his nostrils; skin and a trace of sweat and urine. He still hadn&#39;t had a talk about hygiene before sex, but now was not the time, and to be honest it wasn&#39;t as strong as last time, and it really didn&#39;t bother him.<br />
<br />
Instead he marvelled at how her slit, even with her legs spread like this, was completely hidden by her fat labia majora. <br />
<br />
&quot; It feels really spread!&quot; She laughed. Eric grinned &quot;It&#39;s actually still closed babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; She responded crunching up to look. &quot;Wanna see inside?&quot; She grinned up at him, he nodded enthusiastically.<br />
<br />
With dark hands and pink palms her long fingers arrived either side of her slit and sinking into the fat folds, pressed in, then apart, spreading her pussy wide open.<br />
<br />
Finally Eric saw pink, though it was only in the centre slit, in her most private place, her vagina a small pink hole nestled between her now visible dark inner labia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow...&quot; Eric was stunned, to which Leah giggled a chocolate laugh from deep in her throat. &quot;Want to kiss it?&quot; She asked. He nodded and got into position. The heat now was almost unbearable. But he took his time, grabbing her leg and kissing it, slowly making his way, kiss by kiss down her inner thigh, each one bringing him closer and her breath get deeper and deeper.<br />
<br />
The world hung on a moment as he finally hovered over her, then softly leaned into it and melded his lips to her inner vagina. The taste and sensation of the silky slick, hot flesh drive him wild, and he kissed again, harder this time.<br />
<br />
Leah gasped, letting go of her lips and grabbing Eric&#39;s head, fingers curling into his scalp and pressing him in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Eric. Kiss it! Kiss it harder!&quot; She begged. &quot;It tingles!&quot; She whined. Eric brought his arms around her legs and using his thumbs spread her pussy wide open again.<br />
<br />
With full view he could concentrate properly. He began kissing her, licking up and down her labia minora and gently tonguing the entrance of her vagina. He also made sure to occasionally lick and give attention to her chunky hooded clit.<br />
<br />
He enjoyed the squeaks, moans and twitches that came from Leah, she seemed more comfortable making noise and occasionally telling him, &quot;Oh that feels goood!&quot; Or &quot;do that again!&quot;. She was definitely getting into it more this time.<br />
<br />
By the time her talking subsided and was replaced with laboured breathing, he could feel the slickness of her sweat from her legs as the alternately clamped his head and swung wide open.<br />
<br />
He concentrated then more around her vagina, probing deeper and deeper with his tongue. Each probe met with an involuntary thrust of her hips, as if she wanted him deeper.<br />
<br />
She let out a ragged, &quot;goooooood... eeerrric!&quot; And curled her toes into the carpet panting. He redoubled his efforts then. Poking and prodding and blinding speed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Oh god. Tingly... good. ggOOOOOD!&quot; she whined, giving herself over to the orgasm. She let out 2 deep throaty growls before Eric changed tactic and switched to her clit, wrapping his lips around it and sucking hard.<br />
<br />
That made her ass jump and grind into the ground, but he hung on and kept sucking.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH! OH! OH! HNNNNNGGHH&quot; she began to shake violently, eyes rolling back into her head, face grimacing, nails digging painfully into Eric&#39;s head. Finally her breath caught and with a loud &quot;haaaaaa&quot; she fell back, legs closing and pushing Eric away.<br />
<br />
He pulled back to see her big eyes gazing up at him, full of love. After a few moments, her heartrate coming down, she said, &quot;I love you! Still can&#39;t believe you&#39;d stick your face down there where I pee! Must be yucky.&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all!&quot; Eric grinned, &quot;smells and tastes beautiful, like you!&quot; He licked his lips for emphasis.<br />
<br />
Leah laughed, &quot;You&#39;re such a dork.&quot; She relaxed and looked down. Then without ceremony dropped a hand, swiping between her pussy lips with a little grunt and pulled it to her mouth. She sniffed it and made an unenthusiastic face, then slipped the finger in her mouth, licking it clean. She rolled the taste around her mouth for a moment or two then shrugged. &quot;Meh. Not yucky, but I wouldn&#39;t say beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric chuckled. &quot;Well I think it is!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s a girl/boy thing?&quot; She suggested. &quot;How do you mean?&quot; Eric responded. &quot;Like I taste good to you, and you taste good to me?&quot; She offered. Eric raised an eyebrow. Intrigued to where this was going. &quot;Maybe... can I kiss you? On your penis?&quot;</p>
