<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monica tried to speak again, but she could only bark -- and also whine, groan, and whimper a little. They were the only sounds she would be making for the rest of her life. Max perked his ears and the barks of his human mate, fascinated that she would be joining him as a dog. Her ears started swelling and deepening, growing taller and wider until they were just like the shepherd ears Max had.<br />
<br />
Monica was amazed by all that she was able to hear now, pivoting her ears around eagerly to pinpoint sounds that would have been too faint or distant for a human to notice. She couldn&#39;t believe she was going to be a dog! It wasn&#39;t the life she had planned, but it was a life she could share with her lover. And it was a life that could have new abilities and experiences waiting for her.<br />
<br />
Her eyes turned brown, and her vision turned wonky, and she wasn&#39;t sure she could ever get used to seeing how a dog sees. In time, she would, though. Regardless, sometimes sacrifices must be made for love. &#39;If we can&#39;t be together as humans, we&#39;ll be together as dogs!&#39; she insisted to herself. &#39;I&#39;ll be satisfied to see what Damon sees.&#39;<br />
<br />
The audience and Monica both saw nipples sprouting down her chest, but Monica had to feel it happening as well. It felt incredibly weird, but also somewhat arousing. Her human breasts were starting to shrink, giving her a more (albeit still blurry and discolored) line of sight to her new additions. That was the moment she realized that her dream of having kids with her boyfriend would have to mean suckling a litter. She reached down to explore her new nipples and found pleasure in the touch of her hands. Some men in the audience started tugging at their pants at the sight of a naked woman fondling herself in ways no human should be able to.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t much longer until the fur started to grow in. It started with a light dusting of brown on her arms, legs, and chest, but it soon became a shaggy coat of black, brown, and tan. Human hands felt even better on her body now that they could stroke her fur. She caressed her chest, her sides, and her belly like a porn star, arousing many of the straight men and lesbians as she did so. She didn&#39;t care that she was acting like a sex object. She knew she&#39;d never have to worry about hiding her body or her sexual prowess any more. She was discovering how enjoyable human contact could be for a canine, and she was going to provide herself with this pleasure as long as she still had enough humanity to do so.<br />
<br />
As the fur finished growing all over her, the audience saw her tongue stick out as she began to pant in front of the hot spotlights. At first, Monica didn&#39;t seem to be getting much relief from this, but then her tongue stretched out in front of her, giving her it enormous new surface area to drip and evaporate her saliva. She curled its new length and width, impressed by the amount of dexterity she had in it. It would turn out to be quite useful when she learned to eat and drink without hands.<br />
<br />
A deep lust was pulsing and throbbing within her, not just in her chest or in her mind, but between her legs. It got more intense and more tantalizing as the seconds ticked by, and a musky secretion started dripping from her feminine orifices. She wanted sex. She wanted Max. She wanted any male, for that matter, and could probably make due with a female under the right circumstances. Madame Illusia wasn&#39;t just reshaping Monica. Illusia was sending her into heat. Monica tried putting her human hands to use one more time, sending them down beneath her lowest pair of nipples to appease her counterpart to Max&#39;s waistline anatomy. Whistles came from the audience and salacious comments came from the Madame. But Monica was too absorbed in her own self-enjoyment to pay them any attention. What she couldn&#39;t ignore, though, was that after a few minutes, sharp pains started pricking her sensitive flesh. She removed her hands from the needy area and looked at them, discovering that she had already started growing her new claws. They were thick and pointed, and they were only the first sign that the gift of human hands was no longer for Monica.<br />
<br />
Monica&#39;s thumbs started to shrink, but the skin on her fingers and palms started to grow and darken. It was getting tough to move her fingers, but she would soon be able to bound across complicated terrain on all fours. &#39;Just hold in there a little longer, Damon,&#39; she thought silently. &#39;Soon we&#39;ll be together on equal footing--literally on equal footing!&#39;<br />
<br />
Her feet started stretching and growing pads and claws of their own, and soon it was getting almost impossibly to stay upright as her hips and spine changed. She fell forward and felt her forepaws catch her weight for the first time. Her claws clicked loudly in her massive ears as she did so. And then she felt her nose start itching forward, and then it wasn&#39;t just her nose. Her mouth was growing longer, stretching forward under her nostrils, filling in with new sharp teeth along the way. Whiskers sprouted, the tip of her nose moistened, and new smells started competing for her attention. She dropped her lengthening muzzle to sniff the stage. She raised it back up to sniff the air. Soon her wiggling nose had led her all the around in a great big circle to the space between her own legs, where her throbbing genitals were beckoning. She lapped at her own parts once or twice, taking advantage of her own flexibility, almost dizzy from the smell of her own pheromones. And then she got a whiff of Max, whom she had known as Damon. He was coming over to sniff, too, and when he got a decent whiff, the pointed tip of his new penis poked out from his sheath. She sniffed at it, sniffed at his fur and then under his tail. She memorized a scent that would prove unique to Max among dogs. And then she licked his phallus.<br />
<br />
The male dog shuddered and leaned in closer to lick her dripping hole. But something was missing. Monica needed a way to express her enthusiasm, and something about her new body didn&#39;t feel complete. She had lost what she was going to lose, but there was one more thing to be gained. Her tailbone snapped. And then it throbbed and stretched. And then it twitched and split, spawning new bones and muscles that flexed and flailed behind her. And then, at last, she could look behind her and see the tail she would carry for the rest of her days: long and shaggy, hardly different from the tail Max had, albeit a bit lighter in some areas and darker in others. And it was wagging ecstatically.<br />
<br />
The two dogs jumped and yipped, circling around each other and getting acquainted all over again in their new forms. The feelings coming from their hearts, and from their loins, were driving them crazy. Madame Illusia smiled at her creations and bowed deeply for the audience. They gave a standing ovation.</p>
