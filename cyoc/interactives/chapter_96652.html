<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><b>With</b> the success of every great invention comes the continuation of that success. Cellular phones had gone from grey bricks to nearly paper thin. Porn had gone from the pages of nudie mags to hundreds of millions of gigabytes of porn available at ones finger tips thanks to the glorious creation of the internet and personal computer. It only made sense that TransDem Labs did the same. Sure, their creation of the Chronivac system was revolutionary behind the scenes. Those few select people chosen out of the millions across the country to test such technology out in the privacy of their homes. To bring forth their deepest and sometimes darkest desires with nothing more than a portable emitter, a USB connection and a CD. Long before the creation of the popular video game, “The Sims”, Chronivac was paving the way of creating and controlling ones life from the tips of their toes to the very hair on top of their heads. But ultimately..they knew they’d have to do more. After the initial models were delivered to that very small handful of members within that control group, the scientists and researchers carefully evaluated their success through the very software provided to their so called customers. They learned what worked and what didn’t and ultimately found themselves on their way to yet another beta release. The Chronivac Q series. Far more superior than the original with a plethora of additional options to utilize in ones..ideals. Everything that was the core of TransDems success all condensed into a sole pairing of hardware for one lucky citizen to use at his discretion.<br />
<br />
The weather was unseasonal that cool September morning. It’d been raining for about 24 hours now and there were already risks of flash flooding throughout the area but somehow….it was business as usual there in the cozy township in Connecticut.  Cut to a rather stout figure, Charlie, moving quickly up the sidewalk of his home trying to keep from getting completely soaked under the torrential downpour. As quickly as he approached the front door on his porch, he pulled his keys free from his pocket and manipulated the various items in his arms around so he could unlock and push the door open allowing him to rush inside. Finally. He was home out of the rain. He’d have been home much sooner had it not been for noticing a package being soaked by the rain on his neighbors porch just next door. The Petersons were gone for the summer, so he’d been delegated to pick up their mail when it arrived and place it within the basket beside his front door for them to pick up upon their return. Just like always, he sat the pile of both his mail and the neighbors mail down on the side table, removed his coat and scarf, then turned to see what the postal service decided to grace his mailbox with today. Bills…Bills..and more bills. That was his stack. The second stack however seemed a bit more interesting. There were letters sure, but there on top was a small brown wrapped box with a label on top. The box itself was clearly soaked from the rain and the writing on the labeling had been all but smudged off in his grasp but he could still see an insignia in the top right hand corner; Trans..something. <br />
He tried his best to pat dry the box so it could begin its drying process there on the table but the moment he picked it up to pat him some of the water that had pooled there on the table, the tape on the bottom lost all security and fell loose allowing the contents within the fall free to the floor at Charlies feet. His attention dropped to the floor then and the wrapping was laid to the side while he knelt down to pick up the contents and examine them.<br />
<br />
“What have we here….”<br />
<br />
 The first item was a small crystal jump drive with circuits in the center. It sort of looked like the very jump drives he used himself as an instructor at the local high school but much more fancy. The second item looked almost like a webcam, also made from the same clear crystal with all of its circuits embedded within the center and a lens on the front. The black cable extending from its back was tied and secured to the base and had a small piece of paper attached. As he unfolded it there looked to be instructions, or at least he assumed, but they were all but faded as well from clearly having been sitting in the bottom of the box which was arguably the wettest. Charlie held both items in hand for a moment, curiosity slowly beginning to creep its way into existence and as he rose back to standing upright, he looked up then to the mac book positioned at his desk there in his office. It couldn’t hurt just to see what the item was could it? Within a few moments, he was there seated at his desk with the items there beside him and the soft glow from the screen highlighting his obviously aged features. He wasn’t but 38, but a stressful life and lack of consideration for his overall health made him look at least 50. The salt and pepper hair atop his head gave him a more regal look especially when he wore his glasses, but his body had long since lost the toned stature of his youth and instead held a much more cushioned foundation that put him just overweight enough to have consistent warnings from his doctor but not enough to care. The first item he plugged in was the jump drive. The moment it initiated with his computer, the drive itself lit up and began blinking green. On the computer screen, a sleek looking letter “C” appeared followed by a notification dead center that had only one request: “ Please Initiate Emitter “.<br />
<br />
“Hmm..”<br />
<br />
Charlie read the request a second time, reaching up to adjust the black rimmed glasses upon his face before looking over to the second item he’d retrieved from the floor; the clear sphere. Since there was nothing else, he carefully began undoing the metal clips holding the cable in place and carefully plugged the USB end into the side of his laptop next to the jump drive. At first, he expected something else to happen but it didn’t…then..it did. The blinking green from the surface of the jump drive stopped and a few seconds later turned light blue. The emitter seemed to whir to life itself then offering a slight vibration against the hardwood surface of the desk before falling silent. It too glowed light blue. On the computer screen, the notification vanished suddenly and the screen then went black briefly and a series of selections appeared on the screen in place of the usual desktop. Running vertically from top to bottom, there were several fields where information had to be input as follows:<br />
<br />
-Height<br />
<br />
-Weight<br />
<br />
-BMI<br />
<br />
-Age<br />
<br />
-Eye Color<br />
<br />
-Hair Color<br />
<br />
-Shoe Size<br />
<br />
-Waist Size<br />
<br />
When he reached the last section, he let out a slow exhale and an assumption. He knew his neighbors to be vegan health nuts so immediately his mind went to this being some sort of health nut computer program and his interest dropped slightly. Still, he had it up and since he knew the answers to all of the information provided anyway, he began filling out each of the fields. One by one, his information was populated into each line until he reached the last selection. The moment he typed out his answer in the last field, a small indicator loaded quickly across the bottom and a small arrow pointing to the right appeared. He clicked. A new set of fields appeared then but this time they were much more..personal. That made his brows raise slightly and inspired a slight clearing of his throat as he read each of them and slowly began filling them in as well. The main ones that caught his eye were;<br />
<br />
-Penis Length<br />
<br />
-Penis Girth<br />
<br />
-Circumcised or Uncircumcised<br />
<br />
-Body Hair<br />
<br />
-Build<br />
<br />
-Sexuality<br />
<br />
-Personality<br />
<br />
-Attractiveness (1-10)<br />
<br />
Charlie’d be lying if he said he’d never measured his own cock. What man hadn’t? That made entering that information much easier than expected. 7 inches, uncut with a thick girth. His sexuality was..a bit more on the hidden side. He had an Ex Wife of course but the reason behind her being his Ex was very clear. Charlie liked men. The indicator blinked there on the line waiting for him to answer and he swallowed somewhat wondering if he should. As far as he could tell, this was anonymous right? It wasn’t even his package he’d picked up so who would know? Quietly, after even more hesitation, he typed in the word “Gay” and just like before an indicator loaded across the bottom. Instead of another arrow though, there was another field that popped up. “Save Name:”. Charlies eyes locked on the blinking indicator wondering what that meant before finally he opted to type something generic and without specification as to who’d filled it out. “Profile 1”. The information he filled in vanished from the screen again in a sort of fading animation and to his left, the sphere whirred to life. The lens on the front illuminated and the sphere itself pivoted on its base until he was aimed at him and blinked twice signifying it was active and no longer in standby mode. Obviously Charlie had no idea what this meant so the look of shock and mild amusement held across his features. <br />
<br />
Finally..something else appeared on the screen now. In the center, there was a figure of a man, all gray, with all the same measurements he’d entered put in place. He was impressed. The gray Claymation looking figure looked almost exactly like him when he was naked, sans the lack of skin tone or facial features. To the left and right of the figure however were other options to choose from. Instead of giving him the option to type in like he’d done before, there were sliders now beneath each selection that went either left or right. All of the selections before were present and at the bottom was a blue button animation, which was darkened at the moment. Slowly, Charlie went selection by selection down the list he’d filled out before. The more he played around with the options, the more he got the hang of it all. Everything he selected via the sliders adjusted via the clay looking figure in the center of the screen. By the time he’d finished, the form looked nothing like his current reality. Instead, it looked like what he wanted to be with an exaggeration on a few key areas. No longer was the form flabby and out of shape. Now it was quite toned, with not a lick of body fat, and body hair in all the right places. The younger he set the slider, the more defined the body became until he finally stopped it right at 18 years. The cock however was where the exaggeration, or so he thought, came in. Rather than the 7 inches it started with, it was now well over 10 inches and just slightly thicker than he already was. The balls hanging below were about the size of lemons and the pubic hair selected was copious but trimmed and limited to just around its pelvis. Was this his desired self? Maybe. It certainly caused a devilish look to form on his face as he leaned back in his seat and admired the changes he’d made to this…Game? <br />
<br />
Throughout it all, he still hadn’t figured out what it was or what its use was. After letting off a sigh, he finally looked down at the bottom of the screen again and noticed the blue button was now glowing blue much like the two pieces of hardware. It wasn’t glowing before was it? Slowly, he drug the pointer down and hoovered over said button and without hesitation, he clicked to see where this program would take him next. The moment he clicked, a timer appeared with 2:00 fixed at the center and another button beneath. “Initiate?” was inscribed across the center of the now blinking button from before and just like before, he clicked again. Just like it had before, the sphere whirred again and suddenly a bright light emitted from the lens. Charlie watched silently for a moment when he felt it. There was a sudden rush of warmth over his body that made him stand up quickly from his seat and take a few breaths. <br />
<br />
 “W..whoa…What’s..”<br />
<br />
The timer began counting down now and the closer the clock got to zero, the warmer his body got. He snatched his glasses from his face and tossed them to the desktop then gripped the edge of the desk as he tried his best to get ahold of himself. Something was definitely happening, and the longer he stood there the more he could feel his body reacting to…something. His arms seemed to get much more defined right before his eyes, and down lower, he could feel his thighs tightening against the fabric of his khakis. The fat that originally layered around his legs had been replaced by sheer muscle and that muscle flexed every time he moved causing the hem of his slacks to rip slightly from the new pressure. Around his crotch he felt even more tightness as his original 7 inches of cock swelled to a new length of 10 inches and the thickness added to the pressure of his left pant leg as the thick muscle grew downward and halted just above his knee. 0:03…0:02….0:01…0:00.<br />
<br />
It was over. Finally. The warmth began to subside until finally he felt normal again. The sensations he now felt however were still there though. Moving his arms…gripping the desk. Flexing. Everything was much more sharp and defined. Quickly, he undid the buttons along the front of his shirt and ripped it open to reveal the new cut 8 pack that replaced the former pliable gut he had there before. The tightness of his belt and waistband prompted him to quickly undo the belt and try to undo the button of his pants which promptly popped off and hit the desktop in front of him. He had to unzip them and pull them down even further then until finally he was standing in nothing but his boxer briefs where that thick length now hung just beneath the thin fabric.<br />
<br />
“Ohshit……what the fuck…whaaaat the fuck….”<br />
<br />
 Both thumbs hooked into the waistband of said boxers and after shoving them down past his knees, he stayed there..hunched over..staring at his new cock and balls. It was gorgeous. Uncut, the head peeking just slightly from beneath that beautiful foreskin and every vein dormant, just waiting for a reason to fill with blood and bring his new monster to life. Everything about his body had changed and when he looked up to the now blinking indicator on the screen he could see that…everything there…was now everything about his body. “Complete” blinked for a few more moments then the screen went back to the selections he’d chosen and left him to revel in the look of his new…self. Both shoes were kicked off and he struggled to get both his pants and underwear off completely so he could run from his place there at the desk to the large mirror there in the main hallway. Everything was exactly how he’d chosen in the program. He looked like he did when he was 21, only much more toned, with hair swathing across his pecs, abs and pelvis flawlessly. When he turned, he saw his ass was just as toned as the rest of his body. Now he knew what the items did..and that was why he looked back toward his desk slightly unsettled…but strangely satisfied. The look in his eyes changed. The worry was quickly being overcome by the devilishness he now felt thanks to his new, inadvertent gift. Standing there almost naked in his hallway, he went back to checking himself out in the mirror. The sleeves of the short sleeved dress shirt he wore tightened against his flexing biceps and flowed freely with no pants to be tucked into as he turned back and forth. This…was definitely something he could get into..and it was then that he knew he would NOT be passing the device off to its originally intended owners. He was 18 again, and effectively hotter than he&#39;d ever been during his first go round. This..was definitely something he could take advantage of. His self-admiration was soon cut short then when he heard a sudden knock at his door via the door knocker, and three rings of the <b>doorbell…..</b></p>
