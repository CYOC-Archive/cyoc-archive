<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat had put Dans cage on her desk and headed over to Jens house, with the plastic box that once held Dan inside to take her to the vets. As Dan heard the two girls leave she came up from under the bedding to explore the cage again in hope of an escape of what wad to come. <br />
<br />
It had been about an hour since the girls had gone and Dan was getting use to life as a pet mouse trapped in her cage with no way of escaping as she heard the girls return through her sensitive mouse ears. Kat and Jen both entered the room with the small plastic box which now contained a small brown mouse. Dan was terrified she knew what was about to happen and dug herself under the bedding to try and get away from her fate. <br />
<br />
Kate placed another spell on mike the mouse to change his mind into that of a normal mouse whilst changing Dan so that not only did she keep her human mind but was then in heat. Dan felt her mouse nether regions start to tingle then felt a soft warm goo start to drizzle from it, she didn&#39;t know what to do but hopefully hide underneath the bedding hoping that Mike the male mouse wouldn&#39;t find her. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately as Mike mind had been reduced to that of a normal mouse his senses were heightened and could smell the terrifies female mouse that was I&#39;m heat and he started squeaking unable to wait for his prize. Jen picked Mike up out of the box by his tail and dangled him before her for a bit examining her brother that had been turned into a mindless small rodent. She then spotted a tiny stub which was producing tiny spills of white liquid Jen then suddenly realised that it was the mouses tiny penis and laughed at the site of it, it was no less then about 4-5 millimetres in length. Kate had a loom to see what her friend was laughing at then giggled herself &quot;haha what a pathetic waist of a penis, looks like he&#39;s excited anyway&quot; Kat said with glee. <br />
<br />
Jen whilst still holding Mike the mouse in the air by his tail opened the lid to the cage that Dan was in the lowered then tint dangling hormonal rodent into the cage that was occupying Dan. The next thing Dan knew she felt a presence behind her then she felt something penetrating her rodent vagina and squeaked at a high pitch. Once mike had got inside of Dans vagina the rodent started to pump her as hard as he could not knowing what he was doing, whilst Dan was brought to tears in her eyes as she was being pounded by this small creature that once would of ran away at the size of her if she was back in her human form. <br />
<br />
Whilst the two mice were going at Jen and Kat just watched &quot;Hahaha awww it looks like little Danni mouse is enjoying her treatment&quot; Kat and Jen both said in unison. Dan wanted to shout at the but couldn&#39;t as all he could do was squeak everytime Mike the male rodent was pumping into her, this went on for about five minutes before Mike had finally given up and was satisfied with his work. Jen then grabbed Mike by his tail again and deposited him back into the plastic box. &quot;right I&#39;m going to go home now and give Mike his mind back his done his mating duties but since I&#39;ve seen that Dan enjoyed her experience I think I&#39;ll change Mike into a female and get a couple of male mice for him to mate with, let me know how Dan gets on and how the litter are, see ya&quot; with that said Jen was out the door and took Mike home. <br />
<br />
Dan was exhausted with what she had just experienced and rested on the cage floor trying to gain her breath back. Kat then opened the cage door again and grabbed Dan by the tail and lifted her out the cage so she was dangling there. Dan was that exhausted that she didn&#39;t even try to run and just dangled haplessly while her witch sister held her in her grip. Kat inspected her mouse and noticed much more white goo dripping from Dans mouse fanny which was the cum from Mike dripping out of her. &quot;Looks like he did a good job on you, well have to do this more often&quot; Kat said with a huge smirk on her face, although Dan was exhausted she managed to squeak in anger at Kat for doing this to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;hahaha aww don&#39;t be mad just think in a weeks tike you&#39;ll have a litter of baby mice to look after before I can sell them for money, you&#39;re going to make me rich!! I&#39;ve got a great idea I&#39;ll keep you like this and breed you every month!! What do you say to that Danni girl?&quot; Dan used all her might to try and wiggle free from Kat grip but it was to no avail as her tiny paws just pin wheeled in mid air as Kat was dangling Dan by her tail so Dan just squeaked for ages at her in anger. Kat had l, had enough and lowered her new pet mouse back into its cage, &quot;well danni girl since you&#39;re going to be my pet mouse from now on its only fitting that I name you, I know what snowy how does that sound?&quot; Kat said laughing to herself. Dan just squeaked in discuss at the name she had been given and buried herself under the bedding sulking as to what her life had now become a pet mouse for her sister to breed whenever she liked how was Dan to cope as a mouse and would she ever get used to her new life as a pet rodent?</p>
