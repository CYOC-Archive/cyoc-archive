<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria stared in shock at her mother and aunt, she had never seen them so young.<br />
<br />
Ann was now a skinny preteen with long blond hair descending to her lower back while Lisa was now just a small child of 9. Lisa now found the counter tops chest high to her, turning the young girls bottom lip began to tremble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god mom,&quot; Gloria cried as she hugged the young girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria listen,&quot; Katie said calmly. &quot;I want you to take Ann and mom into the living room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria glared at her sister as she continued to look at their grandmother.  &quot;Katie this is too much,&quot; Gloria growled. &quot;Mom and Aunt Ann are freaking out we have to help them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats what Im trying to do,&quot; Katie sighed. &quot;Look.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gloria could see Katie pointing towards the living room. Looking she could see her father and grandfather calmly watching t.v. A confused look now spread across her face. &quot;Wait,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Dad and grandpa didnt change this last time. They&#39;re....they&#39;re not getting any younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; Katie said. &quot;The spell isnt affecting them anymore. My theory is the spell is only affevting these three now. Take Lisa and Ann inti the living room away from here. If you have to use the ring to keep them from getting any younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Although still unsure Gloria nodded as she now guided Ann and Lisa into the living room. With Lisa and Ann safe for the moment Katie now looked back to see Marilyn sitting at the table, calmly looking at her granddaughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie if were going to eat today I need my daughters assistance,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma,&quot; Katie replied. &quot;Enough if this, Lisa and Ann are just children now. Leave them out if this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that their children Katherine,&quot; Marilyn retorted. &quot;Its a dream come true, I have my little girls back. Lisa is back to an age where I was her whole world while Ann has finally moved past the dark time if her life. Finally I can take care of my girls once again.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two women now cooly looked at one another Katie noticed anothee ripple pass through the kitchen. Maeilyn shivered as she began to grow younger once more. Katie watched as the womans face became smooth while her body began to firm up. Marilyns d cup breasts seemed to vecome perkier as she reached the prume of her life. When the ripple passed Marilyn was only 25, quickly Katie looked back towards Ann and Lisa, smiling. The latest time skip had left Lisa and Ann unaffected.<br />
<br />
&quot;What gives,&quot; Marilyn asked. &quot;Why did I grow younger again so quickly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you grandma,&quot; Katie smirked. &quot;You are going to grow younger faster now. Its only going to speed up now too since Lisa and Ann are being protected by Gloria.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn frowned at Katie, sighing she stood up, examining her youthened body before returning to her cooking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Protecting Ann and Lisa,&quot; she scoffed. &quot;Thas my job as a mother. Cant you see what a blessing this is? After feeling useless for so many years I can finally be the mother my children need once more. This time I can avoid the mistakes I made as a parent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my mom, can you fix that as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn paused as she looked back at Katie. &quot;No,&quot; she whispered. &quot;But like I said that was my greatest mistake as a parent. Your mother....your mother was a very strong willed woman. We may have gotten along well but when she made up her mind she was impossible to sway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So its always about control then,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;Like your mother controlled you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn grit her teeth as she smacked her hand in the counter. &quot;No its not like that, &quot; she grumbled. As Marilyn now looked at Katie another ripple passed through the kitchen. Marilyn shivered as she once again grew younger. Katie watched as Marilyns face became younger, more innocent. The shocked woman looked over her body as it continued to firm up, her curves decreasing slightly. When the ripple finally passed an auburn haired girl of 20 now stared back at Katie.<br />
<br />
Marilyn ruahed to the hallway mirror, gasping at her youthful appearance. Grasping her long auburn locks she stared back at Katie. &quot;Im...im still getting younger,&quot; she whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes grandma you are,&quot; Katie nodded. &quot;Right now your barely old enough to be a mom. If things keep going pretty soon you&#39;ll be so young youll be looking up at Lisa and Ann.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn grunted in frustration. Stomping to the table the young woman now sat down, crossing her arms as she frowned at Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma I need you to tell me about my mom, thats the only way this is going to end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already told you Katie,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I was stubborn and so was she. I already regret that I told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Theres more though,&quot; Katie said quietly. &quot;Otherwise the spell would of ended, so let me know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn sighed in frustration as she looked at her granddaughter. She realized she was going to have to bare her soul if she wanted to remain an adult. &quot;Ugh fine,&quot; she sighed.<br />
<br />
Marilyn now looked at Katie groaning. &quot;Okay your right,&quot; she said. &quot;My mother always tried to dictate how to raise my children. I would try my best to fight back but...she...well, she would win the day. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who doesn&#39;t want to please their mother,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I tried my best to raise my girls. Your mom was old enough that she saw what was happening back then and called me on it. My...my pride wouldn&#39;t accept that. I loved your mother dearly but no one ever likes having their faults exposed especially by their own daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn and Katie now stared it eachother in awkward silence. Marilyn sighed as ahe now sadly looked at Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;The last convwrsation I had with your mother was about you and her sexuality,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I was shocked to say the least. You would think a mother woould know who her daughter loved. I...I didn&#39;t want to believe it. I tried to convince her that she didnt feel like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie gaped at the woman as she began to wipe her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was stupid,&quot; she moaned. &quot;To be honest I just worried about her future. Kellie had a promising law career ahead of her. I worried that a baby and her sexuality would hamper her career. I..I told her she should give you to me so she could focus on her career.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked at the  mournful expression on her grandmothers face. As she was about to speak another ripple spread through the kitchen. <br />
<br />
Marilyn shivered once more as she grew younger once more. Katie watched as Marilyns face became more innocent while her curves began to vanish. The young teen frantically looked down at her chest as she watched her breasts shrink from d cups to c cups. When the wave passed a 17 year old girl now stared wide eyed at Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what the hell,&quot; Marilyn exclaimed in a youthful tone. &quot;Im like feeaking apologizing why am I a freaking teenager again?&quot; Marilyn paused, something didnt seem right. Cocking her head slightly she now gazed at Katie. &quot;Um Katie,&quot; she asked. &quot;Why am I talking like a freaking teen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well grandma,&quot; Katie said calmly. &quot;You are a teen right now. You.may have your adult memories but your emotionally a teenager.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that just super sucks,&quot; she grumbled, before sughing in frustration. &quot;Ugh talking like this makes me sound sooo immature. I mean I like apologized for being an old fart why am I still turning into a kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost apolgized,&quot; Katie corrected. &quot;Your building to that, whiich reminds me I dont know if I can call you grandma when you loom like this. You want mw to call you Mari or Lynne?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn frowned as she saw thw playful smirk on Katies face. &quot;So not cool,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Obviously you inherited you moms sarcastic sense of humor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Katie chuckled. &quot;So just one more question. Do you have a problem with homosexuals?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like no way,&quot; Marilyn exclaimed. &quot;I mean when your mom told me all those years ago I was like a little grossed out but Ive like evolved in my thinking. If your my family I love you no matter what. It was my mom who was like puritanical and stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie considered what Marilyn said carefully before nodding. From what she could tell her grandmother was being sincere. She didnt detest homosexuals and had changed her opinion, despite her age. Slowly Katie approached he, placing her hand on the teens shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgive you grandma,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Marilyn smiled, hugging her granddaughter tightly. &quot;Thanks Katie, &quot; she sighed. &quot;I was like such a hardass. I let my mom have too.much say in my life because I wanted her approval. I should of like known better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I get it,&quot; Katie said quietly. &quot;No matter how old we get our mom is still our mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two now stood quietly as they looked out towards the liiving room. &quot;Ugh Im going to have to apologize to Lisa, Ann and Martin,&quot; she groaned. &quot;I like always sycked at apologies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; Katie smirked. &quot;But why grandpa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Martin knows Im a hothead and stubborn and he still stood by me all these years,&quot; she said, dreamily looking at the old man. &quot;I like cant believe hes been so patient with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be true love,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Now lets go apologize before you end up Lisa&#39;s little sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyns eyes bulged as she now looked at Katie. &quot;Wait Im still getting younger?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably grandma,&quot; Katie grinned. &quot;So make it a good apology. Pretty sure tgis isnt over just yet.&quot; Marilyn groaned in typical teenage fashion as the two now approached their family.</p>
