<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drew and Derrick locked eyes as Derrick seemed to be contemplating something to say, until a large movement behind Drew caught his attention.<br />
<br />
As Derrick eye&#39;s refocused and darted to something behind him, Drew turned his shoulder to see a massive shadow of a Minotaur hulking over him.  &quot;Uhhh.... hi there big guy&quot; Drew blurted out.  He looked and sounded exactly how the Faun had looked, hoping that perhaps the Minotaur wouldn&#39;t attack.  It was then that Drew heard weak laughter to the side of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;...eheheh...&quot; the previous Faun now tiny dicked ginger stable hand chuckled weakly.  &quot;..You&#39;re going to get it now...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Minotaur leaned over Faun-Drew and took in several deep sniffs.<br />
<br />
From Drews perceptive, his magical Faun form gave him a new whole spectrum of vision.  Looking up at the Minotaur, it&#39;s like his cock and ass were almost highlighted in his vision, he seen them clearly and knew exactly what they were capable of.  Between this influx of information, and the fear of the Minotaur, he stood still as the bull smelled him.<br />
<br />
Then, he leaned over towards Derrick, and took a a deep sniff of him as well before shaking his head and then looking over to the newly transformed ginger.  He took one deep sniff at the weakened stable hand on the ground and gave one nod as the bull&#39;s mighty cock slowly came started to come to full mast.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  What are you doing...&quot; cried the weakened ginger, as the Minotaur helped him to his feet.  He was much larger than his previous Faun form, but the Minotaur has no trouble lifting him up at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  He took my form!  I can&#39;t be stuck like this...  wait!  UHHH, OMG&quot; he yelled.  As he was talking, the Minotaur lined him up with his mighty Minotaur cock that had somehow been lined with three prepuce rings; most likely a magical alteration.  Then, as the ginger stable hand weakly struggled, the minotaur impaled him with his cock.<br />
<br />
The ginger might have been newly transformed, but the cum and previous lube was still smeared all over his ass.  As the Minotaur slowly drove his cock into him, the ginger winced in pleasure as each prepuce ring made it&#39;s way past his anus.  His protests changing to moans as his eyes rolled back as he bit his lower lip in absolute pleasure.  Before he knew it, he felt the Minotaur&#39;s balls resting against his ass; gingers were made to be the perfect bottoms, and the 16&quot; of Minotaur cock filled him completely.<br />
<br />
Drew and Derrick (who now masturbating again) couldn&#39;t tear their vision away as the Minotaur seemed to form a brief smile upon his snout as he finally was able to get his entire cock into his lover.  As he vigorously had his way with the previous Faun, the silence of the Minotaur was offset by the loud grunts and moans of the new ginger before he suddenly screamed.  His own dick, a mockery of a equine cock that reached only 5&quot; in length, spit out the tiniest amount of cum as his own belly started to distend; a lone grunt coming from the Minotaur as he shot his load into the stablehand below him.  As his belly distended from the torrent of cum, the stablehand tried to grasp his own cock to increase the pleasure, but his large meaty hands could barely grip onto the tiny thing.<br />
<br />
Satisfied, the Minotaur then effortlessly lifted him off his still mostly erect cock, causing a Champaign like flow of cum to eject from the gingers ass.  Then, gently putting new ginger back on the ground, he wiped his dick into the ginger&#39;s face as he nodded, then slowly walked away.  The ginger on the other hand, lay on the ground in anal bliss for a few moments before coming to his senses; his dick still limp.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Why?!?&quot; he demanded weakly, indicating towards his own tiny cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you have to ask that, you wouldn&#39;t understand&quot; replied Drew, his voice full of distain as he stood up and walked over to him.  &quot;You better start crawling back towards the stables, because unless you start your work in the morning, you won&#39;t get your meal.&quot;  As he came over, the ginger&#39;s eyes glazed over as the musk of the Faun took over his nostrils, and reached up towards the Faun&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Drew on the other hand took a firm grip of his new goat dick, then began to piss over the ginger (who opened his mouth and gleefully accepted it).  &quot;I have access to your memories, you have been doing this to people for...&quot; he paused for a moment, &quot;for almost two hundred years!  You arrogant cocky shit.  You&#39;re going to stay in those stalls forever if I can help it; I made that dick of yours so desensitized you&#39;ll be the stable cockslut.&quot;  Then, raising a hoof, he kicked him backwards onto his back before turning to go help Derrick.<br />
<br />
Getting him to his feet, the two walked back in the direction of the previous Faun&#39;s room, leaving the weakened stable hand on the ground in a pool of Minotaur cum; Drew was eager to see his new abode.</p>
