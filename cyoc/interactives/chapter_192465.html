<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Before the Lust Wave earlier...)<br />
<br />
It took a moment to work up the nerve - for some reason, Matt was feeling a lot more abashed about removing his shirt so easily in front of people like he did before. But when he did Gary gasped at the sight. Matt&#39;s formerly muscular chest was indeed still strong, broad and impressive - but in a totally and entirely different context.<br />
<br />
Large and voluptuous but visibly tight and well formed breasts rested upon the jock&#39;s chest, and his shoulders - while remaining broad and powerfully built - now had a slight shift in their form and appearance. His hands daintier while remaining strong and retaining their callouses. Matt&#39;s face was now a vision of feminine beauty twisted into the visage of oh so masculine gloating show-boating. Because even as the basic structure changed, Matt&#39;s body had remained distinctly powerfully built, rippling, and muscular. <br />
<br />
The heavy clothes of a footballer had simply concealed what rested underneath, due in part to the structural changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still think,&quot; Matt spoke in a rather androgynous tone, not quite female but not male either - achieved with some effort by Matt, &quot;I&#39;m all soft and girly, Gary?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never said you were,&quot; Gary could hardly keep his eyes off of Matt&#39;s breasts, and neither could Graham...or Clara, who distinctly felt a sense of odd envy despite the fur that extended up from Matt&#39;s stomach in a line and wrapped about his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just said you were a hot girl.&quot; Gary commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Matt flexed a bicep, &quot;Well, I&#39;m not. Still a guy over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt...&quot; Graham breathed, looking at Gary&#39;s enrapt interest and thinking about what happened between Gary and Monique out in the woods, &quot;I think you should keep your shirt on. You...do look a lot like a woman where it counts. And I just think---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You saying I should &quot;present&quot; as a woman, Parker!?&quot; Matt was suddenly aggressive, and Gary realized that as much as his form changed, and as feminine as he looked, Matt&#39;s innate nature did not in fact change much if at all. Though a somewhat perverse inkling started its way in his mind about whether Matt had his unit at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No...not at all.&quot; Graham defended himself, &quot;I&#39;m just saying...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, <i>I&#39;m</i> saying I&#39;m still a guy. Doesn&#39;t matter what this fucking place does to me. I&#39;m a man and that&#39;s that.&quot; Matt crossed his arms under his chest. He then looked at Gary, noticing the tail awkwardly placed in Gary&#39;s pants. An idea started to come to Matt. One coached in his old life as the ur-jock. <br />
<br />
The sorts of masculine contest that he distinctly remembered he and his friends participated in. They lacked workout equipment here, but he figured body weight would be fine. &quot;How about we settle this male / female thing? I can prove I&#39;m still by far manlier than you, Gary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Gary stepped forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;A contest,&quot; Matt stated, &quot;A simple contest. You and me. 90 seconds to see who can do the most of some exercises. If I win, you accept I&#39;m a man&#39;s man even with these knockers on my chest. You win...well...I&#39;ll let you touch em.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...For real?&quot; Gary felt a sense of confusion at that offer. Matt was very much still an overmacho douchebag. A regular machismo-laden jock bro type of the sort he usually didn&#39;t exactly hang out with all the time for a reason. But at the same time, the fact was aside from his muscles, Matt did indeed look like a woman. A very very appealing woman, if one with more muscle than him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m game, then.&quot; Gary saw no reason to refuse at this rate. He could reconcile his heterosexuality with this if he won...and he saw no issue if Matt ended up triumphant. &quot;Hey, Graham, could you uh, keep track?&quot; As Gary said this, he pulled off his own top, and despite his own vaunted sense of jock &quot;no homo&quot;, Matt found himself staring at the lean, tightly muscled and visibly in shape Gary&#39;s chest and stomach. He could fucking trace every single abdominal muscle there...fuck...<br />
<br />
No! No no no! <br />
<br />
Matt was here for one reason right now. And that was to prove that he was every bit the macho male he was - and is! &quot;A-Alright, man, we&#39;re gonna start with push ups. Hope you&#39;re ready to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I am!&quot; Both Gary and Matt started prepping for it, and then as they got on the floor to start, Graham began to get ready to start his count.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go.&quot; He said with a sigh. Graham couldn&#39;t believe that with all this going on, these two were settling this kind of an issue. But he supposed if they couldn&#39;t find their way out, there were worse things that could be going on.<br />
<br />
Immediately Graham watched as the two muscular specimens on the ground started doing their push ups. Gary was taking a slight lead due to Matt dealing with the added weight on his chest, but it was pretty obvious who was in better shape between the two as the 90 seconds went on. Gary&#39;s endurance obviously was great, but Matt&#39;s speed and strength had not abated with the changes. In fact it seemed if anything the deer transformation lent him a slight edge in endurance in line with the deer&#39;s capabilities.<br />
<br />
Matt was starting to pull up on Gary.<br />
<br />
The 90 seconds went on, and Gary started to realize as they belted out their numbers that Matt was really not just gaining on him, but also just as well exceeding him as it went on. He started trying to go faster, but his shoulders and elbows protested at the increased strain. It was clear who here had trained for strength and conditioning versus who trained more for looking good and endurance.<br />
<br />
As the ninety seconds ended, Matt&#39;s total was at 67, Gary&#39;s at 58.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kicked. Your. Ass.&quot; Matt rested on his laurels for a moment and looked at the sweat-stained body next to him. He choked down a response he didn&#39;t want to think about. His new, wet organ under his heavy balls ached with need...need he tried to ignore. Gary was objectively attractive - and Matt felt a desire to both plant his manhood despite his straightness right into that ass, and have Gary delight his new organ resting betwixt his legs.<br />
<br />
It was a frustratingly queer thought that made Matt bite his lip and try to think of other things. Things like continuing the contest, even as the ebb of the Lust Wave began, a trickle that would lead to a tidal wave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s---Let&#39;s uh, do some squats now.&quot; Matt breathed, a heavy and hot breath that clouded the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing. If there&#39;s one area I&#39;m pretty sure I could have you beat, it&#39;d be legs.&quot; Gary taunted him, and got up. The well muscled young man stood there, his new tail helping him quickly rebalance after his push ups. He guessed there were *some* perks to this sort of thing. Both started to get in position, hands up behind their heads - Gary&#39;s position exhibiting his well muscled chest, Matt&#39;s making a display of his breasts.<br />
<br />
And this display made poor bisexual Graham feel a tight sensation in his pants he tried to ignore even as he concentrated on the task at hand.  &quot;I-I uhh...I...are we sure this is wise? Uhh...&quot; He gulped, and said, &quot;You guys ready? Steady? Go.&quot; He started counting the 90 seconds as both Gary and Matt began their squats, which might be quite a questionable choice in exercise in a place associated with such a sexual curse when one considered the display that might be associated with such a movement.<br />
<br />
Gary gulped as he felt his tail wavering around during the movement, noting as he did the way it steadied and aided in his movements in its own way. He could see Matt having the same experience with his own - the feminine jock grinning despite himself and powering through rep after rep even as Gary moved to keep up.<br />
<br />
Monique for her part having kept quiet wisely during the boys&#39; macho posturing kept a watch to try and make sure nothing happened. She didn&#39;t need Gary getting any more bestial. To tell the truth she didn&#39;t know how good she was with this. With any of this. It felt almost dream-like - or, in terms of Gary&#39;s changes, slightly nightmarish. Her boyfriend now had the masculine unit of a fucking canine. How was she supposed to have sex with that? Was she supposed to just overlook it in---in... she breathed and kept her mind on the present rather than on nightmare scenarios.<br />
<br />
At least it seemed like the boys were dealing with this relatively well.<br />
<br />
Gary gulped as he felt his ass and legs slick against his cheer outfit bulging against it in one of his squats. None knew what was to come, and as he looked over at Matt he swore he could see the plump little nipples on the jock&#39;s boobs. He couldn&#39;t let himself get sidetracked, they were pretty neck and neck with the squats. He wasn&#39;t just gonna let Matt have this one...<br />
<br />
And with what was to come, Matt made a relatively crucial and rather poorly informed choice in an attempt to get Gary off of balance. He could see the cheer boy seemed like he was sneaking glances at Matt&#39;s breasts. So the jock just grinned and said, &quot;What...? You like what you see? You like this?&quot; He moved his hand over a breast, &quot;You wanna touch my boobs, little guy? Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary could feel his manhood gorging with blood, and awkwardly enough due to the way squats were done - all the way up and all the way down - he felt his cheeks grow flush as he realized the tight material on his uniform meant that very little was left up to Matt&#39;s - and his friends from outside&#39;s - imaginations. Graham gulped and fought down a reaction as lust welled up inside of him, remembering that this---this was a student he was looking at.<br />
<br />
Graham growled and tried to leave, only to find Clara staring at him. &quot;N-No...No...No.&quot; He gruffly told her, shaking in his place and trying to make his exit from what was becoming an increasingly sexualized competition. Gary leaned into it, letting Matt see his cock - hard and lupine - taking up so much of the front of his uniform. He didn&#39;t know why - but when he saw the supposedly so hetero jock staring, he knew why.<br />
<br />
Matt probably really did have quite a wet little pussy in between his legs in addition to his manhood. Which, speaking of, was growing just as erect as Gary&#39;s. 90 seconds came and went, and Monique realized what was going on. &quot;Hey---Hey you two...I uh, I think it&#39;s done...&quot;<br />
<br />
And thus, Gary and Matt stood there at the end, staring at one another. The awkwardness only lasted as long as it took for the starting ebb of the Lust Wave to turn into the full force crest of it all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Matt...Gary...&quot; Monique tried to stand in the way of it. Function as a rock amidst the waves of lust rampant over the changing people present in the area. Clara was needily pining for Graham, though as she looked at Matt and Gary, she was obviously starting to consider going for them...but her lust for Graham prevailed - and she charged off after Graham. Monique shouted after her, &quot;Clara...Clara don&#39;t!&quot;<br />
<br />
And when she looked away, it failed. Her move was broken by her lack of concentration.<br />
<br />
&quot;...<i>Fuck...!</i>&quot; Matt said in a breathy feminine voice, abandoning his attempts for now at pursuing a more masculine vocal alignment. Before long in the midst of the Lust Wave, Matt suddenly crashed forward against Gary - and the two were passionately and overwhelmingly making out. Gary&#39;s hands cupped Matt&#39;s breasts, drawing a loud moan out of the jock...<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, Gary...that feels so good...keep going! I want---I want...!&quot; Gary for his part barely even noticed the rock hard erection poking up in the front of the pants of this busty, muscular &quot;woman&quot;, so intent was he on satiating his needs. Barely even noticing that his ears were starting to draw into longer, more wolf-like configurations - a long line of hair starting to grow down Gary&#39;s back as he and Matt continued their erotic interplay.<br />
<br />
Matt for his part couldn&#39;t stop himself from feeling up Gary&#39;s body and his manhood - that tantalizing and alluring thing pressing so readily up against the front of his uniform. Matt adapted to his new body&#39;s look and feel - pressing his curvy form against Gary, the male cheerleader growing increasingly urgent in his arousal. Matt himself adjusted and outright started pulling his pants off. And for Monique, she knew this was her last chance before her boyfriend and the lead bully jock-now-busty-hermaphrodite started literally fucking right in front of her.<br />
<br />
Monique moved in and outright started trying to pull Gary off of Matt, who was REALLY not taking that very well at all, &quot;Fuck!? What the fuck, woman!? We&#39;re trying to get fucking laid here!!&quot; He shouted, though he was so headily aroused in the moment he couldn&#39;t stop trying to get off. Before long his clothes were off...<br />
<br />
And Gary for his part growled at Monique almost like a wolf, and went back to making out with Matt. Monique realized she&#39;d need to go for something a little more extreme as she saw all this going on. Gary was continuing to feel up Matt, seeming to enjoy the way the jock&#39;s new body mixed the masculine muscles Matt had before with the new feminine traits - both completely overwhelmed by the mad, erotic power of the Lust Wave that now rushed over them.<br />
<br />
Monique then moved in and outright grabbed Gary by his wolf balls and <i>squeezed</i>.<br />
<br />
Gary let out a long gasp of all too familiar masculine pain in response to the attack on his most intimate part, and the situation between him and Matt more or less suffered a critical interruption. Gary fell to the ground whining and groaning from the painful interruption. Any hope of this getting more erotic - let alone Gary getting his cock into Matt&#39;s new female genitalia - was more or less dashed due to that groin assault.<br />
<br />
A seriously sexually frustrated Matt glared daggers at Monique, &quot;You...! You fucking...I was...I needed that! I needed some fucking relief! Look at me, I said look!&quot; Monique for her part tried to look away, but Matt moved up right in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I can&#39;t get blueballed from here, with both my cock and my pussy! What do you think that&#39;ll---&quot; Matt almost looked ready to cry he was so frustrated. Gary looked almost betrayed and hurt that Monique would do such a thing to him. For her part however, Monique stood fast and strong. She wasn&#39;t going to let some fucking curse, some sexual compulsion, make her boyfriend and Matt make animals out of each other. Even as she stood there she could see the ears on Gary returning to normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you go jerk off then, Matt?&quot; Monique asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t I just---fuck you, lady. Fuck. You.&quot; Matt groaned, &quot;You think it&#39;s that simple?&quot;<br />
<br />
By now, the Lust Wave was starting to abate - it was at its highest point before, and now it was ebbing, at the lowest, and slowly retreating away - returning to the distant places in the forest. The jock and the male cheerleader were starting to come down from the high of the experience. And as Matt and Gary&#39;s vaunted hetero sensibilities returned from the preference-blasting effects of the Lust Wave, both nude young men looked at each other with a horrified expression.<br />
<br />
Gary&#39;s expression of betrayal turned to one of understanding - though he was still wincing from the pain.<br />
<br />
Matt quickly started getting dressed again, and he glared over at Gary - not even wanting to think at this point about the fact he had just almost jumped Gary&#39;s bones. And how his new pussy had yearned so thoroughly for it, &quot;We&#39;re...not a thing, you got that? I&#39;m straight. I go for chicks. Girls. You got me? You got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Same, honestly. Whatever just happened there...oof...seems it kinda pushes us into...oww...&quot; Gary got dressed in short order as well. He was mollified by the realization he too had just almost leaped into Matt&#39;s bed so to speak. He didn&#39;t know now how capable he would be of staying true to that statement he said to Graham not too long ago. Whatever was going on here it was capable of overwriting even the most ardent preferences in the name of simply &quot;getting off&quot;.<br />
<br />
Matt for his part just kept his pants and t-shirt on at this point, &quot;Fuck...thanks, Monique. You uhh, you did ultimately save us there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...No problem, Matt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what the fuck is going on here!?&quot; And there was Coach Banks, having walked in at the end of the drama that had played out there. He could see Matt, Gary, Monique...and no Clara or Graham. &quot;You folks? Gary, Monique...where&#39;s Graham Parker? He&#39;s supposed to be your---&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary winced at the pain in his genitals remaining and realized with a wide eyed stare that as much as Monique had saved him and Matt from any further changes, Clara and Graham were nowhere to be seen. &quot;We gotta find them...they were right here when things went super fucking crazy - and I do mean that literally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go find them.&quot; Monique volunteered.<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the forgotten other student included in their clique for the evening, Mina, was still in the midst of her meditation, attempting to find a way out. And for her part, she was not used to this much of a picture being given. Her &quot;powers&quot; as they were were usually quite weak. And she had thought her mother was not exactly a powerhouse. But as she sat there, slightly levitating above the ground, she could feel something much stronger than usual. She could see the Cabin in the Woods not too far away from here now. She could see a little black book with information inside of it.<br />
<br />
She could see an anomaly in the world - a thing like a worm in the side of the picture of this area. It seemed like it was contained within James. She could feel something strange going on with that one. She could detect something ancient and terrible having happened at the location.<br />
<br />
A dark deed in the ancient past...advantage taken of a powerful nature spirit. But that...could that really account in all for the various spatial, temporal and other oddities in this area? No. No she felt. There was something else she could feel as she delved into the new and somewhat frightening powers being afforded to her. Coming into her own like this should be inspirational, a sort of moment of validation amidst the large and strange location of her familial home.<br />
<br />
Yet there was no explanation for why she would so suddenly come into much greater power...<br />
<br />
Other than something completely esoteric. She considered it. There was the possibility that in the temporal oddity of the place, a further along and more advanced Mina instance in some other, further along state might have influenced the current Mina in her power. And the synchronicity - through the temporal oddity of a place where people, animals and things cannot die by age or other means - meant that Mina was developing power she could not have otherwise possessed at this juncture.<br />
<br />
She was slowly lifting more off the ground. A glowing third eye began to show on her forehead.<br />
<br />
Andrew Farmiga. She could see that one not too far away. Changed...by a lot. She could see Gary and Matt, Monique...Clara and Graha---uh oh. She wondered if what she was seeing was right.<br />
<br />
And more to the point - she could see that somewhere along the line, the Nature Spirit&#39;s vengeance spell had been...altered. And in that alteration, it allowed the intervention of and enhancement therein from some sort of higher power outside of the immediate vicinity. She could not see who it was that undertook this sordid deed. She could only see black feathers, and a dim countenance, bleak and featureless. She found herself in her inexperience drifting back to reality.<br />
<br />
The glowing third eye vanished, and Mina stood back up from her spot. &quot;Where...where---no, when?&quot; She looked around. It seemed some time had passed. She was alone out here. And she knew that this was not a good place to be when it came to being there by herself. So hence she started on a jaunt toward the Cabin in the Woods.</p>
