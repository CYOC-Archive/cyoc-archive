<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The poster hung on the wall above Jake&#39;s desk, illuminated by the street lights outside as the yellowish-orange hue of the lamps invaded his personal space. Jake, an average-built young adult of twenty-one, sat at his computer looking at images and thinking up what he was going to do for his first Halloween now that he was of age to drink and buy alcohol in a public environment. Leading up to this very evening, he was originally supposed to go out with his friends and have a good time, but suddenly out of nowhere, plans changed and he was left to his lonesome. Jake sighed as he flicked through several images of werewolves, going on a bloody rampage and tearing prey limb from limb. Jake even considered putting on a werewolf film that was of the horror genre, considering he viewed werewolves as monsters. They weren&#39;t cute, cuddly, or oversized dogs to be tamed… no… they were uncontrollable monsters that wouldn&#39;t think twice about tearing a person apart, limb from limb. Once again Jake found himself fantasizing about transforming into a werewolf and murdering anyone and everyone he chose, but such things weren&#39;t possible.<br />
<br />
As he sat there and pined over the bloody imagery, the werewolf poster on his wall started to shimmer and ripple, as if coming alive. The poster depicted a werewolf who was seemingly ready to jump off the paper, ready to pounce on the viewer. If Jake had been paying any attention, he would have seen the vicious fangs dripping with thick saliva and eyes that glowed pure crimson, signifying its menacing and evil intent. Still, Jake was too lost in his fantasies to notice.<br />
<br />
“Man… what I wouldn&#39;t give to have an awesome werewolf transformation and become a true Apex Predator!” He cheered as he found a gruesome, yet very detailed comic that showed the transformation in slow, glorious, and vivid detail.<br />
<br />
As Jake remained lost in thought, the image of the werewolf changed, as it was now grinning with sinister delight and intent. Its gaze was directed slightly downward, and looking at him, the first recipient of his gift in a long time, was ripe for the taking. The werewolf knew Jake would appreciate his gift more than anyone, but at the same time, he wanted to have fun, as he hadn&#39;t been able to truly enjoy himself in such a long time. That damned warlock saw to that all those centuries ago, locking his spirit in that poster until the right place and the right time, something that has only happened once every few centuries since then. The last time the opportunity arose, the poster was rolled up and stored away somewhere. Now, it was October 31st, the night of the true full moon, where the moon was at its zenith and radiating its most potent source of power. Leaping off the poster as a disembodied spirit, the werewolf began to manifest himself in his well-built, burly, and rugged human appearance just outside Jake’s door.<br />
<br />
“H-help me…” He said weakly, nowhere near full strength to easily take a corporeal form.<br />
<br />
Jake nearly jumped clear out of his desk chair, completely surprised to hear another person in his house. There shouldn&#39;t have been anyone in the house, other than him, considering he lived with his dad, and he was out patrolling the streets.<br />
<br />
Spinning his chair around to confront the voice, Jake shouted, “Who the fuck are you and what are you doing in my… h… hhhooouuuuuussssssssseee?” elongating the last word as he saw the man standing there, naked and beyond attractive!<br />
<br />
The man that now stood before him in his doorway was a perfect specimen of the male body! He was at least six feet and one inch tall, handsome and yet rugged simultaneously. He had a strongman build; huge, pillowy pectorals, covered in short light brown hair that collected and pooled in the cleft between his pecs; the hair cascading down and over his muscle gut that didn&#39;t stick out too much, but was a prominent feature and size. Simultaneously his shoulders were the size of half-formed basketballs, going down to his biceps and triceps that were like huge rugby balls, tapering down to well-muscled forearms, capped off by a pair of decently large hands. His body hair was light, barely a dusting on his shoulders and upper arms until his elbows, where a forest of thick, dense hair coverage of dark brown hairs came flooding in, trailing off on his hands, giving him somewhat hairy hands and fingers. Placing his attention back on the man&#39;s torso, the chest particularly, which looked as thick built as a massive wine barrel, was adorned with the same light brown hair washing down to his pubic region revealing a slightly thicker, yet still trimmed and styled bush. Resting just below his beautiful bush was his rock-hard and throbbing six-inch long, beer can thick cock, with an above average-sized scrotum holding a pair of hen&#39;s egg-sized testicles. Jake&#39;s eyes trailed down the man&#39;s thick muscled thighs, which were slightly hairy, but gaining thickness and density as they went down to mid-thigh where the hair picked up in density, thickening to a veritable forest by the time it reached his knees. It continued to flow down with the same amount along his lower legs and meaty calves that abruptly ended at his ankles before reaching his decently large, sized ten feet. The man honestly reminded Jake of how his father looked the time or two he had seen him naked accidentally, not that Jake was complaining, because much like the stranger… Jake found his father to be incredibly hot and an example of what to strive for physically as a masculine man.<br />
<br />
Jake took a moment to compose himself, collecting his thoughts, but eventually, he started to stand and approach the stranger. He wondered how this person might have gotten into their house when Jake knew for certain that the house was locked. His dad always kept the house locked, entering and exiting through the attached garage. His dad, Chris, told Jake that he wasn&#39;t going to arm the security system in case Jake was able to make other plans and he was able to go out after all. It wasn&#39;t that Chris didn&#39;t trust Jake with the alarm code, because he did and Jake knew it by heart… it was more of a convenience to him in case Jake had to rush out in a hurry.<br />
<br />
With his attention focused, honed in, and interested in knowing what the hell was going on, Jake started asking the man questions, while going through the clean laundry he was supposed to separate and fold of his and his dad&#39;s but just hadn&#39;t gotten around to it yet, thinking of something he could give the man for some modesty. <br />
<br />
“Seriously buddy, how did you get in here?” Jake asked.<br />
<br />
Between labored breaths that seemingly conveyed to Jake that he was out of breath and out of sorts but in truth the short breaths only masked the stranger&#39;s predatory and horny desires, the man spoke in short words with his deep and slightly growly voice, “garage… open…”.<br />
<br />
“Well… that makes perfect sense! Here, throw these on…” He said tossing the stranger a pair of his dad&#39;s plain ‘around the house clothes’, consisting of a light blue pullover tee-shirt and gray sweatpants that were slightly baggy on his dad. “Dad kept telling me the garage door would sometimes stick, get caught during the closing cycle, and would reopen as a safety precaution because the motor wouldn&#39;t know if it hit a person, an inanimate object, or whatever else it got caught on. Go ahead and wear those, dad has several more like that and he won&#39;t miss one pair.” Jake said, not really thinking about why he just divulged a security flaw of their home to a complete stranger. <br />
<br />
The stranger, hearing the words Jake spoke as he sat back down in his desk chair, looked down at the clothes somewhat confused, which Jake mistakenly took as the man just not wanting to be any more of an inconvenience. “Go ahead, put them on! We can&#39;t have people seeing a fully naked man, a stranger even, walking around our house. What would the neighbors say?! Dad doesn&#39;t let me have friends over unless he&#39;s aware of them ahead of time… and you are definitely a surprise even to me. Not that I&#39;m complaining…” Jake said trailing off as he watched the man get dressed.<br />
<br />
As the man stepped into the loose-fitting sweat pants, then pulled on the shirt that clung closely to his body, accentuating the muscles Jake had already seen in their bare glory. His mind began to wander, imagining seeing his dad standing there instead. It was no secret that Jake was a bit of a pervert, having eyes for his dad, but he felt like no one could truly blame him. His father was a bit piece of eye candy that anyone would ogle and the only reason so many people were against incest was it was considered taboo. Sure… a kid and their parent shouldn&#39;t have sex, but at the end of the day… they are still two people with urges and desires that aren&#39;t exactly controllable. People can&#39;t help what or who they are attracted to… it&#39;s not definable… it just is. If only for a moment, as Jake stared at the stranger, the stranger took on his father&#39;s appearance, and knowing he must&#39;ve been hallucinating, he shook his head clear and the image returned to that of the stranger.<br />
<br />
Clearing his throat, Jake coughed slightly, “so… erhm… what&#39;s your name mister?”<br />
<br />
“My… name…?” The stranger, still composing himself a bit more, stood in the doorway looking confused and lost, as if these words and thoughts had been lost on him.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… your name… you know, what I should call you in order to help you better? Man… you must&#39;ve been hit over the head or drugged pretty badly with something because it&#39;s like you don&#39;t even know the basics.” Jake said a little rudely, not thinking before speaking like even he knew he was prone to do.<br />
<br />
“Yes… my name…” The stranger pondered, then it came to him out of the blue as information came to him from the movie poster he looked up at that was hanging on Jake&#39;s wall. “My name is Trevor Banks…” the self-identifying stranger revealed.<br />
<br />
“Trevor Banks, as in the character from the best werewolf movie as a true horror movie?! That Trevor Banks?!” Jake said as his eyes went wide, knowing that was a fictional character&#39;s name from his favorite werewolf movie.<br />
<br />
Trevor nodded as he walked a bit deeper into the room, getting closer to Jake who was sitting at his computer still after throwing him clothes from across the room. “The very same!” He finally said as his look became dark, evil, and sinister.<br />
<br />
Trevor smelled the air in quick, successive sniffs, creeping closer and closer to Jake without asking as Jake sat there, both confused and excited. Trevor could tell Jake was truly into horror and even more so werewolves. Trevor’s actions were getting more and more predatory by the second and, had Jake not been lost in everything that was happening, his danger sense would have been going off like crazy! Trevor&#39;s eyes, just outside of Jake&#39;s view, took on a hellish crimson glow like his eyes would in the movie while his teeth elongated and became more fang-like as the gum tissue broke and bled, washing his tongue with the coppery and metallic fluid he so enjoyed. However before Trevor fully looked at the man in the room, he reigned himself back in before the wolf got out a little too much. Trevor so loved the hunt and wanted this game to go on for a bit longer. <br />
<br />
“Wait… Trevor Banks is a character in the movie, played by legendary horror actor Ryan DuMont. Man… that blow to your head or whatever you were given really, really messed you up. Tons of people must be frantically trying to find you!” Jake said, realizing the gravity of the situation and immediately went to reach for his phone.<br />
<br />
In a flash, Trevor swiftly grasped Jake&#39;s forearm and stopped him from making any rash decisions. The werewolf in him wanted Jake to be his… his first convert. The longer he was in this world, he realized the world he knew in the movie wasn&#39;t the same as the one he found himself in, hearing terms like actor, movie, and so on. He didn&#39;t even know who this person Ryan DuMont was. He was Trevor Banks… mass murderer, serial killer, and monster werewolf who used his bestial side to help in his killing spree to not get caught. He wasn&#39;t sure of what was going on, but he knew one thing… his fun wasn&#39;t going to get spoiled before it even got started! “No… please… don&#39;t.” He said, playing up his role, playing on Jake&#39;s apparent love for the world Trevor knew he was from. “I… I don&#39;t remember much, but… what I do remember is that the ones who captured me threatened to kill my real family if the cops got involved. Please… help me figure out what is going on before doing anything.” He said, pleading with Jake, sounding genuine. <br />
<br />
“Ok… ok. We&#39;ll figure things out and go from there. What&#39;s the last thing you remember before escaping?” Jake asked, having learned from his dad to get all the details possible as early on before they left the victim&#39;s short-term memory. <br />
<br />
“Um… before finding myself in your garage and house… not much. Just blips and flashes…” He said as Jake turned in his chair, placing his attention on the computer screen in front of him.<br />
<br />
Now that Trevor had Jake&#39;s attention focused elsewhere, he let his wolf emerge more. He could feel the hunger growing, the need to taste human blood and flesh. The hunger to consume the man&#39;s heart made his mouth water as his fangs slipped out once again; his body growing tighter in the kids’ dad&#39;s clothes, filling them out more and just started stretching them. He started getting hairier and looking wilder; his ears started stretching, elongating slightly, gaining pointed tips; his eyes resumed their evil and sinister look; while his hands got a little thicker and meatier as his fingernails began to bleed as they were ripped up from the pure black claws that were emerging from underneath. Trevor&#39;s tongue grew more pliable and licked over his fangs, knowing that this was his moment to strike, willing all of his teeth to become more lupine to really break the gum line and bleed profusely in order to get his lycanthropic blood into Jake&#39;s veins before he lost his chance.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yes! I&#39;ve been waiting for this moment ever since I first saw you and knew you were greatly into werewolves! Seeing that desktop image of my transformation into my werewolf form before you opened the browser to start looking into my story only made me know my choice in you was well-founded!” Trevor said, catching Jake off guard, pinning his hands to the desk with his immense strength and keeping Jake from doing anything. “You&#39;re mine, PUP!” He said with an aggressive and dominant tone, audibly claiming ownership over Jake. <br />
<br />
Before Jake had time to realize what was going on, though noticing Trevor&#39;s clawed and more rugged hands now that it was too late, Trevor made his move! In a flash, Trevor opened his mouth wide, latched onto Jake&#39;s throat, and sank his fangs deep into Jake&#39;s jugular vein, clamping down and holding him there so Jake wouldn&#39;t dare move. Jake screamed in pain and shock, not noticing that Trevor sank his bloody claws into the veiny tops of Jake&#39;s hands and gave more access for Trevor&#39;s lycanthropic blood to permeate Jake&#39;s body. Squeezing his jaw around Jake&#39;s throat, causing the wound to grow wider from the thickness of Trevor&#39;s fangs as it tapered outward toward the base of each tooth, more and more the mixture of corruptive blood and saliva was allowed to flood Jake&#39;s body. Jake&#39;s heart was racing, which only made the situation all the more permanent, circulating Trevor&#39;s blood and saliva in Jake&#39;s body for enough saturation that there was no hope for Jake to retain his once-human existence. Just as quickly as Trevor bit into and clawed Jake&#39;s flesh, Trevor pulled off, licking his fangs clean, savoring the taste of the former human&#39;s blood. <br />
<br />
“Wh-what the fuck man?! Are you fucking psycho?!” Jake exclaimed as he clamped his bleeding hands to his neck, trying to prevent himself from bleeding everywhere. His thoughts still not on the very real fact that a real werewolf… something that was thought only to exist in fiction had not only bit and clawed him, but had infected him with lycanism!<br />
<br />
Stepping back and away from his victim, enjoying his handiwork, Trevor savored the moment and gave Jake a proper view of what he was and how he looked… that was if Jake could take in what was truly going on as his mind was racing. “Nope… just a werewolf claiming his first pup in a very long time…” He said with an evil grin.<br />
<br />
It was then that Jake&#39;s attention was brought forward to take in everything that was going on! The name, the initial appearance, him being naked, and even the things &quot;Trevor” said and did… it was all from Jake&#39;s favorite movie, but how was any of it possible?! Jake saw Trevor standing there, partially changed, looking like how he did in the movie when he wanted to have just enough of the wolf out to infect a victim to be his thrall. His more muscular body filling out his dad&#39;s clothes, the increased hairiness, and brawn, along with the claws, ears, eyes, and fangs… all of it matched how he&#39;d look in the movie!<br />
<br />
“Wait… no…” Jake said in a stupor of disbelief, “This has to be a dream. Werewolves aren&#39;t real. You aren&#39;t real. My blood and these wounds aren&#39;t real. I have to be dreaming!” Jake said, trying to rationalize things, but forgetting a key point… he felt pain and didn&#39;t snap out of his supposed dream. <br />
<br />
“Oh no… this is very real, pup. You&#39;re my first here…” he said as suddenly he disappeared before Jake&#39;s eyes, fading out of existence, but leaving Jake with very real wounds that he&#39;d need to attend to.<br />
<br />
“Ok… OK… this is a dream! It has to be! Shit like this, none of it happens in real life! Guys don&#39;t just partially transform into a werewolf and then fade from sight!” Jake exclaimed loudly, hoping he&#39;d be talking loudly enough in his sleep enough to wake himself. However, nothing happened. Giving himself a moment, Jake pinched himself quite hard, thinking that would wake him up, but nothing. Then he punched his right hand with his left and still… no jolt awake… only pain. “O… k… I… I guess I&#39;m not dreaming?!” He exclaimed as he bolted up from his computer chair, ran to the bathroom, and immediately started running water to at least wash the wounds and start whatever first aid he could.<br />
<br />
As the warm water flowed out of the faucet, Jake tested it with an unbloodied fingertip to make sure it wasn&#39;t too hot or too cold. “Perfect…” he stated to no one, but then grabbed a washcloth and wet it in a single bunched-up spot, making sure no blood was washed away in the drain. If everything was real, there was no way he wanted werewolf blood to be out in the wild, infecting the water supply and potentially releasing a lycanthropic pathogen uncontrolled into the world! Who knew what havoc that could wreak?! However, as he thought about it more and more, a dark and devious smile grew on his face, thinking about just how fun that could be. However, Jake slapped his face, snapping him out of the dark thoughts. “No… I have to be responsible. If I really was infected with werewolf blood and I&#39;m a werewolf now too… my gift can&#39;t just be out there for everyone to enjoy.” Jake said to himself as he carefully washed off the very real and dried blood on his hands, keeping to the spot he prepared, noticing that no wound was there. He quickly switched to his neck, doing the same and finding the same… there were no wounds.<br />
<br />
“Ok… there should be wounds for this much blood! Unless one of two things is true: I&#39;m either hallucinating all of this and none of it is real or he really was a werewolf and I&#39;m already healing very quickly. Either way… these washcloths I&#39;m using have to be destroyed! I&#39;m not taking any risks…” Jake said, talking to himself, dumping the one into the empty trash bag in the bathroom trash bin that was just recently emptied. With the second cloth, Jake left it dry and wiped his hands and neck, wiping up the water and what blood could have been there, then peered into the mirror closely, seeing no puncture wounds on his neck, then switched to his hands again to double check and yet again… nothing was there. Seeing nothing, Jake tossed the second cloth in the bag, then grabbed a Lysol wipe from the container underneath the sink, carefully wiping everything down, hoping the Lysol could at least weaken… if not kill… the already dried and coagulated blood that was on his body that may have got onto the counter. Being as satisfied as he could be, he chucked that into the bag as well, tied it, and went outside to the gas fire pit. Turning the valve and going through the steps to ignite the gas, the fire wooshed to life, flickering and dancing in the otherwise still air. Not hesitating, he threw the bag with the werewolf pathogens onto the fire and watched as it began to burn. The plastic of the bag was the first to dissolve with its noxious fumes as the fire burned green for the moment. Then, as the extra fuel to burn hotter was gone, it returned to the normal red, yellows, and oranges in between. The dry cloth burned up pretty quickly, turning to ash and falling into the pit. The wet one took a while, but it too had succumbed to the flame. “Alright… now that that is taken care of… I guess I need to figure out what the next step is…” Jake thought out loud, stooping down to turn the gas off and placing the lid on the pit to extinguish the smoldering fire in the pit.<br />
<br />
Sitting down in the lounge chair, Jake took out his phone and started Googling things involving werewolves, lycanthropy, and so on to see if there was any information he could find that he didn&#39;t know already. The funny thing was, even though Jake was still looking, he grinned as that dark presence in him emerged once more. He knew that since werewolves weren&#39;t a real thing… up until now… whatever he did come across was just going to be speculation. No one knew for sure… it was just theorizing and fan-boy debating on everything that could potentially be possible and arguing what was thought not to be. If he was infected with lycanism, Jake couldn&#39;t wait to see what would happen, what wouldn&#39;t, and start a werewolf society and be their leader… their Alpha… the first.</p>
