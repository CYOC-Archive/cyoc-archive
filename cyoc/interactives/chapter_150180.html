<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl smiled cruelty at the given information. So Jeff turned his cum-stained sock into his own twin with a time limit? That would explain why Carl remembered that the twin was originally a sock from what he knows about the chronivac.<br />
“Well, let´s take advantage of this situation.” So Carl started typing. After he was finished with his four part change plan he had to wait about ten more minutes before Jeff and his sock-twin returned home.<br />
<br />
The moment they entered the house again Carl hit the enter-key for the first time. It was a rather small change for himself, but would for now primary effect the sock-twin. He felt a small rush of power go through himself and waited for the two grinning.<br />
Coming in Carl greeted them: “Hi Jeff, sock.”<br />
Jeff looked surprised and greeted: “Hi Carl. What are you doing here and why call my twin sock?” He thought that nobody remembered him not being twins, and how was it Carl knows that the twin was former a sock?<br />
The twin instead grinned at Carl before greeting him. “ Hi, master Carl. You need to fill me up again?”<br />
While Jeff looked shocked at his twin, Carl answered: “Not for now, Jeff. And to answer your question, I just dropped by to use something here and awaited your return, sock.” He grinned at Jeff while hitting enter for the second time.<br />
The twin froze in place, his eyes turning blank and unseeing. At the same time Jeff noticed his feet felt incredible heavy, making moving around nearly impossible for him. He looked questioningly at Carl: “What have you done?”<br />
Carl was still grinning at him as he answered. “Well, I came here to use your masturbation sock and discovered it was missing from its usual spot. Then I found your chronivac and with it the missing sock. But I also noticed what I could make out of your own change. I made my own cum addictive to anyone who drinks some of it. So your twin is like a slave to me now. I just froze Jeff here so he won´t hear anything he isn´t suppose to know, sock.”<br />
Jeff was both disgusted and confused. Disgusted that Carl used his sock as well, but confused why Carl called the twin Jeff and him sock. “Stop calling me a sock, Carl. You know I´m the real Jeff. And it´s disgusting that you used my sock as well. Why would my twin be your slave?”<br />
Carl laughed and hit enter for the third time before explaining: “Well, with my cum being addictive for others, as a consequence, Jeff here has taken enough loads he is fully addicted to me. He would do anything to get more. And I call you sock because you will retake your place as it while Jeff lives his life, sock.”<br />
Jeff looked at Carl in shock. He should replace the sock? Should completely switch with the original sock, which got his life, only to be addicted to Carl? “You are sick, Carl. I thought we were friends. Get out of here, you are no longer welcome in this house.” Jeff hadn´t noticed that his hands started turning white.<br />
Carl laughed at him again. “What can a sock, a mere part of clothing, do to get me out? Or for the better question, how can a sock see something as its possession? And I´m friends with Jeff over there, even when he sees me as his master at the same time. Now be a good sock and strip out of this clothes. It´s laughable to see a sock wearing clothes.”<br />
Jeff was fuming in anger, but his feet were still to heavy to lift them. At this point the skin on his arms and legs had turned white, and it still spread further. Then he noticed that his hands started to take his shirt off. Looking down he turned pale when seeing his white skin. He remained in shock while his hands removed his shoes and socks by lifting one foot after the other, even when to Jeff they remained heavy. Lastly he dropped his shorts and boxers to the floor before taking one step forward, leaving them behind.<br />
Jeff now stood there naked while the white color covered the rest of his body. As the skin on his head turned white his hair fell out, vanishing before hitting the ground. The same had happened to all of his body hair as well without him noticing. After he was completely bald and covered in white skin the next stage started.<br />
Without any control Jeffs hands balled into fists and the gaps between the individual fingers filled out, leaving him with something resembling mittens. Then the bones, muscles and flesh inside vanished, leaving the mittens hanging useless to Jeffs sides. This continued up his arms until they hang immobile and useless down from his shoulders. That also woke him out off his shock. “Stop this already. I´m not your toy, Carl.”<br />
Carl grinned at the changing Jeff. “Stop complaining, sock. I just return you to your rightful place, only earlier then Jeff himself would have done. Now lay down and let the pressure get out of you, I need to use you.” Carl then stood up and took his shorts off, showing his boner to Jeff, which he then started pumping.<br />
Jeffs eyes widened in horror at seeing this. He let himself down to the ground, laying his head on his own boxers in the process, smelling the cum he had shot earlier in the sock. Some must have dropped down into his boxers. He looked disgusted by the smell, but could do nothing against it. Then he felt his own cock build up the pressure Carl had mentioned, and without any pleasure for Jeff his cock shot masses of cum out.<br />
At the same time his legs started merging together just below his cock and down to his feet. When they were merged together they like his arms slowly hollowed out and turning his skin into soft cotton, only increasing the cum he shot out. It dawned to Jeff that this cum was originally his insides, and the more he shoot out the further he would change.<br />
The hollowing continued upwards, leaving only his cock standing as it passed his crotch. He hadn´t noticed that his limp arms had merged with his sides already as he started to panic more. “Carl. Stop this, please.” He said again, but his voice got weaker.<br />
Carl looked down at him, still pumping his own cock. “You don´t need to plead with me, sock, I will fill you soon.” He moved over and sat down on top of Jeffs hollowing chest, placing his cock near Jeffs mouth. “Now open up, sock. Let my cum seal your changes.”<br />
Jeff wanted to scream at Carl to fuck off, but instead opened his mouth. Seconds later Carl put his cock inside. Jeffs first reflex was to bite down, only to realize that his teeth had already grown into soft cotton around Carls cock. He felt his head flattening under Carls hands as he grabbed his cock with Jeffs head wrapped around like he would have with the sock. The cotton covered his eyes and sucked his nose and ears inwards, leaving his head featureless.<br />
When he was flattened completely beside his cock his body started to shrink down. Not a minute later he was a mostly normal looking white sock, with only his own cock remaining. When the last bit of cum had left the cock it shrunk away into the cotton. Jeff was now fully a sock, only that he still had all his senses and could still think normal. Carls cum then shot into him and he absorbed it rather quickly into his body. While he was disgusted by that he also felt the need for more rising when Carl pulled him off. “I made you more absorbing than an ordinary sock would have been now, so you won´t turn as dirty as before, sock.” he explained grinning down at Jeff.<br />
Jeff was on a short high from Carls cum, already longing for more. “No, I have to resist Carls manipulations and his addictive cum.” thought Jeff when Carl laid him back under the mattress. It blocked part of his hearing and he couldn´t see anymore under the mattress. But it increased his smelling and tasting, primary of the cum he just absorbed, as well as his feeling of being pressed flat. <br />
Carl sat down at the chronivac again, still without his jeans. He hit enter again for the last changes to take place. Jeff had no idea what Carl would do now. First the mess Jeff had made while changing vanished. Carl simply had copied all of Jeffs memories and feelings into the sock-twin, overwriting the “memories” that belonged to the sock mostly. It wouldn´t remember being a sock, but Carls visits to use him changed some memories to him as Jeff giving Carl blowjobs. He would be addicted to Carls cum, but have no recollection of the last hours were the original Jeff “created” him. Instead he was out jogging alone and had just returned. With that the twins eyes refocused again. <br />
“Oh, hello master Carl. Have you waited long?” he promptly asked. <br />
Carl grinned at him. “No, I just came here about five minutes ago and decided to wait for you, Jeff. Ready to get your shot?”<br />
“Jeff” didn´t answer, just walked over and knelt before Carl, waiting with his mouth wide open. Carl just pushed inside and let Jeff suck him until he came again. After getting cleaned Carl turned back to the computer and programmed a password into the chronivac on Jeffs program while also sending a copy home to his own. There he could experiment further.<br />
“Now I will go again. See ya tomorrow, Jeff.” He had closed the chronivac and got his jeans back on before leaving a dazed Jeff alone at home.<br />
<br />
Later the new Jeff used his masturbation-sock two times, filling the old Jeff up with his cum. To Jeff the old socks cum tasted just as bad as the sock had smelled, not that he would have smelled it often. It was a mix of both his own and Carls cum, as well as the dirt that had been on the sock. If he could have he would have puked both times he was used. But he could do nothing.<br />
That was his new routine. The former sock would use him in the morning before replacing him under the mattress, squishing the absorbed cum into his very being. He would lay there while “Jeff” was at school and later jogging. Carl would drop by every evening while the sock was out and used Jeff at least once, sometimes twice before replacing him to wait for the socks return. Later he was again used by the former sock at least twice if not more times before he got to bed.<br />
And every time Carl used him it got harder for Jeff to fight off the need of more cum from him. He was slowly loosing the battle against the addictive substance.  He would never be the same when Carl finally returned him to his human form, if he ever would do so. Unwillingly he had started to think of Carl as his master after the first week, and after the second one he didn´t now why he had fought against Carl before. He was also slowly loosing himself, thinking he had been a sock for most of his “life” and being Jeff or rather his clone had been a dreamlike experience. Unbeknownst to both him and Carl the switch slowly proceeded, so if Carl didn´t change him back soon, he will be in the old mindset of the sock completely.</p>
