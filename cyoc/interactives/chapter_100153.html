<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When we got on the bus we weren&#39;t surprised to see that it was pretty much empty. It was pretty late by the time we got on the bus and not many people would be travelling anywhere tonight. The surprise was that aside from the bus driver there was only one other person on the bus. They were sat near at the back and we decided to sit near them.<br />
The back row had five seats and the other passenger was sat by the window on the right so we sat by the window on the left. Once we were sat down we looked at the other passenger. He was an older man, probably in his late 30s. He had the build of a bear, fat but muscular and covered in hair. He was pretty tall, probably around 7&#39; and looked to have size 13 feet. It was pretty clear that even while wearing me Runt&#39;s aura was still in affect as the guy&#39;s dick was nearly fully hard, and it looked to be about 8&#39;&#39;. He didn&#39;t seem bothered by his boner but he defiantly noticed us staring.<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s your name big guy,&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Mark,&quot; Runt replied in a soothing baritone. &quot;And what&#39;s yours?&quot;<br />
&quot;Jim,&quot; He replied. &quot;So where you heading, Mark?&quot;<br />
&quot;Chicago,&quot; Runt said. &quot;I&#39;m heading home after visiting my brother.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m heading to Chicago too,&quot; Jim said. &quot;Just came to New York for a builder&#39;s convention.&quot;<br />
&quot;Weird that they&#39;d have it so close to the holidays,&quot; Runt said.<br />
&quot;It was last week but I decided to use it as an excuse for a holiday,&quot; Jim said. &quot;To be honest I really attend the convention to find work.&quot;<br />
&quot;Unemployed,&quot; Runt asked.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jim replied. &quot;Lost my job about a month ago. Been living off savings while I looked for work. Unfortunately I&#39;m going home empty handed.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know the feeling,&quot; Runt said. &quot;I just lost my job too. Hoping to find something new soon. Is your family helping you any?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m an only child and my parents die 5 years ago, so no,&quot; Jim replied. &quot;I don&#39;t have any family or friends to help me and I live alone, so I have no one to help me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Runt said. &quot;My Dad passed away when I was little and I never got along with my Mom. She&#39;d wanted me to go to college but I didn&#39;t want to. When I moved out and got a place in Chicago she went ballistic. We haven&#39;t talked since. My brother&#39;s pretty much the only family I have left that I can count on but as he&#39;s got his own family to take care of I can&#39;t ask him for money.&quot; To my surprise apart from swapping the cities me and my brother live in Runt had used my own history for that part. Guess the wearer of a skin suit can draw on it&#39;s memories.<br />
&quot;Seems we&#39;re both loners,&quot; Jim said as he scooted across to sit next to us. &quot;And it seems we have similar tastes&quot; When he said that he grabbed at our very noticeable boner. Seems Runt&#39;s aura wasn&#39;t needed in this case. &quot;Seeing as there&#39;s no one else here who can disturb us, want to have some fun.&quot;<br />
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Runt said before grabbing at Jim crotch.<br />
<br />
Before I knew it we were kissing passionately and feeling up each others bodies. Then our hands found each others flies and unzipped them. Then we reached in and pulled out each others dicks. <br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; Jim exclaimed. &quot;I knew black guys were hung but that thing must be a record breaker.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not too bad yourself,&quot; Runt said.<br />
&quot;Yeah but yours is like twice the size of mine,&quot; Jim said.<br />
&quot;Well then I hope you not too tight,&quot; Runt said. &quot;Because I can&#39; wait to shove this up that big, beautiful, white ass of yours.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can take it all, but I&#39;ll certainly try&quot; Jim replied.<br />
&quot;Well first let&#39;s get some foreplay done,&quot; Runt replied before lying back against the window.<br />
<br />
Jim turned to face Runt and began stroking our dick with both hands. Runt only need one hand to stroke Jim&#39;s dick but he used the other to rub Jim&#39;s decent sized balls. Soon we were moaning in pleasure. Then Jim moved and started sucking our dick. It was amazing just how much of it he could fit in his mouth. Jim&#39;s mouth and tongue moved rhythmically up and down our cock. It was almost too much to take but he stopped just as pre started to dribble out of our cocks. I thought he lean back and try and get a blowjob from us but instead he pulled down his pants and hopped up onto our lap. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready for this,&quot; Runt asked.<br />
&quot;You bet your sweet ass I am,&quot; Jim replied.<br />
<br />
And with that Jim lifted himself up positioned himself over our cock. Then he began to lower himself onto it. He groaned as it poked as his rosebud but then moaned as he lowered himself more and pushed more of our dick inside. He kept going until he couldn&#39;t take anymore. Then he slowly began to lift himself up before going back down. He repeated this motion over and over again, getting faster and faster as he went. Then to both his and my surprise Runt grabbed Jim&#39;s legs and pushed him while lift us up until Jim was lying on his back with our cock inside him. Then Runt took control and starting pushing in and out of Jim. At the same time he was using one hand to give Jim a handjob. Soon we were all moaning in unison. And then without warning Runt jazzed inside of Jim.  But to my surprise Jim didn&#39;t jizz. Inside our head Runt said to me &quot;I can make it so that my sexual partners don&#39;t cum until I want them too.&quot;. Then Runt pulled out of Jim but before Jim could say anything, Runt wrapped our lips around Jim&#39;s dick and sucked him off. Runt kept going until Jim came in our mouth and Runt swallowed every last drop.<br />
<br />
But then something strange happened. Jim started to collapse, just as I had before. Soon he was flat and Runt turned him over and ran our finger down Jim&#39;s spine, thus opening him up and turning him into another skin suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you do that,&quot; I asked.<br />
&quot;I need a new skin suit and he was a perfect candidate,&quot; Runt replied. &quot;Think about. He&#39;s unemployed, has no friends or family that will notice he&#39;s gone and he lives alone. Plus we both like his body. When are we gonna find some one better?<br />
Runt was right about all that. Jim was a perfect choice, but I didn&#39;t know about doing this against his will. <br />
&quot;It&#39;s not really against his will,&quot; Runt said, after reading my thoughts &quot;After all, while I may be a chaos demon my mom was a succubus. Because of that I can sense the subconscious desires of others. And one of Jim&#39;s is to be worn like one of those morph suits.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; I asked.<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Runt replied. &quot;So if anything we&#39;re doing what he wants.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Runts ran his finger down our spine, which opened me up and he stepped out and returned to his normal size. Then he sealed me back up and blew into my dick to re-inflate me. And soon I looked as I did before Runt turned me into a skin suit.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna leave you as you are for now until we get off the bus,&quot; Runt said. &quot;After all the bus driver would notice if a passenger suddenly disappeared and another person took their place.&quot;<br />
After that he looked at the Jim suit.<br />
&quot;I like this body but I&#39;m gonna make one little change,&quot; Runt said. <br />
And with that he grabbed Jim&#39;s dick and stretched it to 12&#39;&#39; to match his own dick. Then he stepped into the suit and closed it up. And there stood Runt disguised as Jim. <br />
&quot;Wow he&#39;s really happy about this,&quot; Runt said in Jim&#39;s voice. &quot;Not only does he love the bigger dick but the fact that he&#39;s being worn by some one else is awesome.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m glad you&#39;re both happy,&quot; I said. &quot;Did you tell him the full truth?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah and he&#39;s excited about it,&quot; Runt said. &quot;He thinks that this will be way more fun than his old life. And the best part is that I can alter the suit while I&#39;m wearing it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well then I guess we should head straight to the airport once we get off the bus then,&quot; I said.<br />
&quot;Now hold on,&quot; Runt said. &quot;Nobody knows what we look like right now and they certainly don&#39;t know about Jim or his apartment. I say we stop off there, grab anything we can use. Then we head to the bank and get all of Jim&#39;s money, after all we&#39;ll need it to buy tickets. And then we head to the airport.&quot;<br />
&quot;And is Jim okay with that plan,&quot; I asked.<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Runt replied.<br />
&quot;Well then let&#39;s do it,&quot; I say.</p>
