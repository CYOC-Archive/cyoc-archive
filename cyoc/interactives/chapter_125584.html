<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isaac&#39;s headache subsided quickly. Enough for him to examine his new form.<br />
<br />
As Isaac examines his new body, he noticed the Choker of Purity around his neck was different from before. For one thing, it&#39;s bigger then before. Big enough to loosely  hang around his neck. If he is not careful, it could easily fall off from around his neck. To compensate for this, the choker is now magically floating around his neck to keep itself from falling. The choker also seems to have changed colors to pure white. It&#39;s color change seems to be the result of the power of purity radiating off of the choker. Isaac recalls that he described his choker as a Halo of Purity. That seems to be a fitting name for it now. It may not be floating above his head, but it definitely has the appearance of a Halo. <br />
<br />
As if the Halo listened to his thoughts, the Halo of Purity floated above his head. Isaac watched in amazement as the Halo now floats above his head. It seems Isaac now has a mental connection to the Halo now. It also seems that Isaac can now control it&#39;s movements and position as if it were a part of him. Perhaps Isaac can also use it in battle? That&#39;s something to try out later.<br />
<br />
It also seems that his pitch black armor is sucking in whatever light is around it. It also seems his Halo of Purity is radiating light around it. Isaac is not sure but he theorizes that his pitch black armor is sucking in corruption and his Halo of purity is slowly ejecting the corruption from him. That&#39;s something he needs to confirm later.<br />
<br />
As Isaac examines his new armor, he realizes that he doesn&#39;t have a weapon anymore. Well, except for the spikes on his armor and gauntlets. He then noticed that his  body is partially composed of air and clouds. It seems that he was able to absorb some of the air dragon&#39;s corruption. Though he is not sure if he was able to fully adsorb the air dragon or not. That is something he needs to ask Ilvir. It also seems Isaac somehow adsorbed his fluffy cloud shoes. Hence the cloud-like qualities on some parts of his body.<br />
<br />
Isaac recalls how the air dragon was able to change shape thanks to it&#39;s air-like biology. Perhaps Isaac can form as sword through the same method?<br />
<br />
So Isaac did just that, he held out his right hand and he felt a part of his metal gauntlet part ways as air, vines, and whatever material makes up his body extends out of his hand and into a blade. When Isaac gave as much material as he could, he cut off the blade from the rest of his body. The whole process was painful. It felt like Isaac was cutting his arm off. When the procedure was done, his dark gauntlet reformed.<br />
<br />
Isaac held before him a ugly blade made of granite, plant, ice, fur, fire, ectoplasm, succubus horns, and other such materials. Despite the miss-match of materials, the blade seems to be very durable and solid. To bad Isaac could only muster enough materials to make it as long as a short sword. It will have to do for now until his body can regenerate more materials.<br />
<br />
But Isaac could continue experimenting with his body later, there are more important maters at hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ilivir. What happened while I was unconscious? Were is the air dragon?&quot; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The air dragon is currently flying around and shredding the town with it&#39;s breath as we speak.&quot; Ilivir reported.<br />
<br />
Isaac cursed under his breath. So the Air Dragon defeated him... For some reason, it seemed more intelligent then most monsters he has encountered so far. The intelligence it displayed seemed different from the Basilisk he encountered. It acted almost like a human... Was he really imagining things when he heard Nathan&#39;s voice, or could that air dragon really be Nathan? It seems to know his name and it battled like a human in dragon form. Maybe Isaac is being too hopeful. Maybe the air dragon is another counterpart to Nathan or someone else entirely. Yet if Ilivir could still exist underneath his wild werewolf form then it could be possible that Nathan is somewhere in the Air Dragon. Unless he is convinced otherwise, Isaac must find a way to purify the Air Dragon of its corruption. However, Isaac has discovered that a creature can prevent itself from being assimilated if it is strong enough. Isaac must get strong in order to save Nathan. Isaac promised to himself that he will save Nathan if possible and plans on keeping that promise!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ivir. How long was I out?&quot; Isaac requested.<br />
<br />
&quot;No less then a few minutes.&quot; Ilivir responded.<br />
<br />
Whether Isaac gets a rematch with the air dragon or not, so long there is a chance to save Nat&#39;s town, Isaac will hold that as the priority.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! Let&#39;s go Ilivir!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Before Isaac could pursue the Air Dragon, Ilivir grabbed his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.&quot; Isaac couldn&#39;t help but notice the purple hue in Ilivir&#39;s eyes. The way Ilivir said that sounded so lust filled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything else you need to tell me?&quot; Isaac asked cautiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; When Ilivir said that, Purple crystals  began growing all over Ilivir&#39;s body, forming a kind of armor. <br />
<br />
Isaac was able to make Ilivir let go of his hand but not before some of the crystals reached Isaac&#39;s hand. Isaac examined his left hand and noticed that some purple crystals has grew on his gauntlet. They don&#39;t seem to be going away and Isaac was not sure if the Crystals were able to infect the flesh underneath the armor. Isaac definitely doesn&#39;t feel any different.<br />
<br />
Isaac watch with slight fear as Ilivir, fully clad in Purple Crystal Armor, walked slowly towards him. &quot;Isaac! It&#39;s high time that you and me become one! And this time, I will be the dominate one!&quot; Ilvir&#39;s voice seems  fully in sync with the demon&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Idiot! Isaac should have known that the demon was slowly gaining power within Ilivir. The signs were all there! The number of times Ilivir masturbated or showed lust for Isaac, that was the demon growing in power!  And now that same demon is trying to assimilate, possess, infect, corrupt, use or do whatever it wants with Isaac! It sure has picked a horrible time to reemerge what with the air dragon attacking the town!<br />
<br />
It seems that Ilivir has fully given in to the lust demon. It&#39;s funny. In a way, Ilivir represents what Isaac could have become if he gave in to the corruption of Calmach&#39;s Crypt. And now, Isaac fully regrets not doing anything about Ilivir&#39;s status as a spawn. He may have saved his life but he has taken away his freedom. Ilvir may have been undeserving of the Title of Paladin as a human, but at least he had his own free will. And now Ilivir is chained against his will to Isaac and Demon. Once Isaac defeats the demon, he must find a way to free Ilivir from being his spawn. <br />
<br />
But one thing at a time. Isaac will find a way to purify Ilivir but for now he must deal with the lust demon. Isaac readied his make-shift sword for battle.<br />
<br />
Demon Ilivir spawned his own sword made of purple crystal in response.</p>
