<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A shock of cold hit Ryan, making him shudder so badly he nearly fell down the stairs. He managed to catch the handrail with his right hand -- thank God it held firm -- and tried to hug himself with his other arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what... urrgk...&quot;<br />
<br />
He doubled over, clutching at his stomach as his guts flipped and flopped around inside him. Heat came with the nausea, and he paled, swallowing against the feeling that he would throw up. Thankfully the nausea subsided quickly, but the heat increased. Feeling weak, he managed to stagger down a few steps before being halted by a chill.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;ve you... done... oh God I&#39;m burning up...!&quot;<br />
<br />
The witch just cackled again in reply. Ryan grit his teeth and put his free hand to his forehead, feeling clammy sweat. He shivered again, knuckles tightening around the rail. He was so <i>hot!</i><br />
<br />
And not just with fever. An unnatural arousal began to bud, and he felt a stirring in his groin. Though it was... off, and not just because of the cramps in his belly. He felt weirdly... <i>impotent,</i> his cock twitching feebly. Panting, he dragged his hand down, half-consciously rubbing across his chest as he did so. His nipples were big -- inflamed, maybe? They felt so tender pressing against his jersey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... what&#39;s wrong with muh... my dick...&quot; His hand reached its destination, pawing feedly at the half-flaccid member. He shivered again, feeling the prickling in his flesh deepen. Obsessed with his inability to get it up, he didn&#39;t notice the growing daintiness of his hand or the black fur sprouting on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooog... ahhhhh...&quot; He did his best to grope himself through his pants -- which were starting to feel oddly baggy around the cuffs but tight around the hips as his muscles shifted into feminine fat. &quot;Ugh...&quot; He collapsed against the wall, barely holding on to the handrail. It almost felt like he was pushing his junk <i>into</i> him, but the more his cock and balls shrank, the hornier he became!<br />
<br />
Suddenly his face and back began to ache like crazy. &quot;Aaaurgh!?&quot; He shook his head, trying to crack his jaws -- and they cracked all right! He stared down, cross-eyed, as his nose expanded out into his vision, long and red -- a narrow muzzle, with a wet black tip. He slid his longer tongue out over sharper teeth, licking in surprise at the leathery pad around his nostrils. The rest of his face quickly followed, furring over in burnt orange and white, his blinking blue eyes shifting to a brilliant green-yellow, pupils dilating in <i>need</i> as his once-chiseled features became a mix of fox and female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooohhhh!&quot; But nothing could distract her -- him for long from the ache in his loins. His hand was starting to push insistently at his tiny, sensitive cock and tight balls, his rear wriggling. Pressure was building up back there, but it didn&#39;t concern him as much as the suction on his privates.<br />
<br />
Strands of lengthening hair fell in front of her -- his eyes, his head hanging as he panted, staring down in disbelief at his open coat being pushed aside by a swelling in his chest. Soon he lost sight of his hand fumbling with his fly, nascent claws scrabbling on fabric and zipper; but he did see soft white fluff poof out of his straining collar, marking the entrance to his... cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh? Noo... AAAAGH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her lusty moan of denial turned into a scream. With a stab of pain and a loud rip of seams, his long fluffy tail exploded through his pants! He -- she arched her back in response, causing her shirt to burst open as well as her white-furred breasts bounced free. She groaned at the cold cellar air on her erect nipples, the pops of her back and shoulders as they settled into a smaller, more feminine frame, the masculine mass shifted to better use in her breasts and hips. The sensations inflamed her lust, the suction in her belly increasing until --<br />
<br />
&quot;Auh... oohhhhhh!<br />
<br />
Finally she felt it, her gonads pulling up into her, leaving an <i>emptiness</i> inside, a hollow void that opened through a pair of vertical lips, lewdly swollen and wet with heat. <i>Heat!</i> So hot!<br />
<br />
<i>So hot! So...<br />
<br />
Horny!</i> <br />
<br />
Human identity shriveled away in vixen lust. Ryan straightened, panting; instinctively she ripped off her coat and torn shirt and shredded her soaked boxers. Letting her stand, a vulpine bombshell clad only in her natural coat of burnt orange and white, with sensual gloves and stockings of black. Blonde hair falling long and sexily disheveled around her back and heaving chest. Cunt dripping onto the stone steps.<br />
<br />
The wild desire, the <i>need</i> to fuck and breed consuming her -- every thought, every inch of her burning, aroused flesh; from her black-tipped ears to her white-tipped tail and padded paw-feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; taunted the witch, &quot;how do you feel now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hoooot...&quot; Ryan moaned. Freed of clothing, her hands began roaming her body, feeling her sleek, satiny fur, the give and heft of her breasts, the flatness of her stomach. Swaying a bit as she groped her pendulous globes, then slid her hands down to her crotch, desperate to get something in to fill the emptiness. She widened her stance, tail thrashing, as she fumbled with her new entrance, greedily pushing her fingers inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Need... to... fffuuuuck!&quot; She closed her eyes. <i>Oh God it&#39;s not enough! Why am I so <b>empty!?</b></i> Somewhere, buried deep beneath her rampant instincts, Ryan still had the weird sense that this wasn&#39;t how arousal should feel; that she should have a big fat cock and full balls, instead of this weird, hollow ache. But thinking about cocks just made her <i>need</i> one more!<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you do. But more importantly, you need to obey <i>me.</i> Isn&#39;t that right, my pretty little foxy?&quot;<br />
<br />
The truth of the witch&#39;s statement was clear in her fogged mind. Ryan opened her eyes, stilling her needy fisting as she focused on the old woman below her, and nodded her assent. The curse didn&#39;t just make her a werevixen in heat; it made her the obedient pet of the witch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I&#39;m all yours... m-mistress...&quot; she stumbled over the word a bit. It was unfamiliar on her tongue, but it seemed <i>right.</i> &quot;Your... your pretty... little foxy...&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
What does pretty foxy Ryan do?</h3>
