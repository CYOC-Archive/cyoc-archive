<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Soon after, Jenn left with Rex, bringing him over to little Chaddy, who was still deep asleep. “See this baby, Rex? This is Chaddy, and you are to “Protect” him, okay? Good boy.”<br />
Rex accepted his role as Chaddy´s protector instantly, like it was planned to happen. Rick, meanwhile was shocked seeing Chad like this. A big baby, covered in a pink, girly onesie, sucking on a pacifier while wearing a diaper. Jenn hadn´t lied, Chad wouldn´t play any football anymore. Just like he wouldn´t.<br />
Chad only woke up when Jenn kissed him on his forehead, as was implanted in the “sleep”-command he had been under. His eyes flew open, at first thinking this all had been a nightmare. But seeing Jenn standing above him, grinning, had him realize it was all true. Without any way to stop himself, Chad started to cry.<br />
“Shh little Chaddy, it´s alright. You are safe. No one will hurt you. Shh.” Jenn calmed him, and it didn´t take long for Chad to calm, and stop crying. That was also part of the “cry”-command. He would stop crying if either his reason for crying was settled, or, in a situation like this, he was calmed by someone.<br />
“See, all good now, Chaddy. Now, look here, I brought you a friend to “Play” with, who will also protect you, little one. Rex, come here.” Jenn said. As Rex came near, Chad looked at the human wearing a dog-suit in confusion at first. Who was that? His body acted without his input and happily giggled around his pacifier, reaching out to the puppy that was his playmate.<br />
Rex enjoyed being petted by his little pup, as that was what he saw Chaddy as, his little pup. He would protect his pup with all he had, that´s for sure. Rick was still in shock mentally, seeing his friend like this.<br />
It took another minute of Chad thinking before he realized who was in front of him, and was shocked seeing his best friend Rick in this degrading outfit. Well, calling it degrading was a bit much, as he himself wasn´t any better off right now. He tried to call his name out around his pacifier, but it sounded more like he had a hiccup.<br />
Jenn understood what he tried to say, and laughed. “Chaddy, meet Rex, our puppy. Rex, meet Chaddy, our little baby. And yes, Chad, that was your buddy Rick, but there is no Rick in there anymore. So, he is no help to you.” Jenn introduced the two officially.<br />
Chad was ready to cry yet again, but Rex, feeling how upset his pup was, nuzzled Chad´s tummy, making him giggle instead. Mentally, Chad was crying about the loss of his best friend. He had no reason to not believe Jenn´s word anymore, seeing how she had degraded him like this. What was to say that she had really erased Rick by making him into a dog?<br />
Rick, hearing Jenn say he wasn´t in his body anymore, would have protested if he could. He was still here, but unable to do anything. But then he realized that while she knew this, Chad would now believe him dead or something like that, loosing his hope for rescue through his best friend. Noting Chad was about to cry again, and how his body made him giggle instead, made it even more obvious to him. It also meant that Chad had no idea he could still free him, making him feel even more trapped inside his own body.<br />
After another ten minutes of Jenn watching Rex cuddle with Chaddy, she went out of the room to get the buggy for Chaddy ready. Soon, it stood in the hall before the room, and Jenn returned with a leash in her hand. “Now, Rex, be a good boy and come here.”<br />
Rex quickly moved to her side, and was put on his leash. “Good boy” Jenn praised him, making him happily pant a bit. Jenn tied the leash to the side of the buggy, before going back into the room, ready to move Chaddy over to the buggy next.<br />
Chad, seeing Jenn was about to lift him up, laughed mentally. No way this girl was strong enough to lift him. But much to his shock, she did so easily, carrying him over to the big buggy in the hall. “You haven´t noticed it yet, Chaddy, but over the last two months, you have lost some weight, you aren´t as heavy as you were before. It´s part of the reason you are so weak now, beside the hypnotic command, you just lost strength along with muscles and weight.” Jenn explained while she strapped him into his seat tightly, making escaping it impossible for Chad. <br />
It had also been part of their commands that the hadn´t realized the changes to the other, and only after Chad was told to remember, and Rick was renamed, had they become able to notice each other’s changes. Without “remembering”, Chad would see Rick in his normal clothes, acting like a dog. And without being “renamed”, Rick would see Chad in his normal clothes, acting like a baby.<br />
Soon, Chad was all clear to be outside, and Jenn untied the leash from the buggy before heading out. Pushing Chaddy´s buggy while holding Rex leash, who easily run along his mistress and his pup. “Let’s start your new life, little Chaddy and puppy Rex, okay?” She said as she closed the door behind them, and headed home with her two additions.<br />
To both Chad and Rick, this was mortifying. Everyone could see them like this. They saw a few people along their way, and while some ignored them, others had fun seeing them, laughing over the big baby and dog slave, as they saw them. But nobody stopped Jenn or asked about the two, as if it was normal.</p>
