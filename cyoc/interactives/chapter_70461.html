<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doug scowled. Kids these days, no respect! He tossed the empty trashcan back into its place on the ground and <br />
headed for the teachers lounge. When he entered, it was empty, and there didn't seem to be anything for him to <br />
do there, so he sat down in one of the chairs for a small break. That was when he noticed the rustle of paper <br />
coming from his pocket. He sighed, and removing the offending slip of paper from his pocket, he moved to throw it <br />
in the garbage - but something stopped him. Curious, he unfolded the paper, and noticed that it seemed to be a <br />
questionnaire. &quot;If You Were A Girl... Questionnaire&quot; was written across the top.<br />
<br />
Doug raised his eyebrow, wondering which student was playing a prank on him, and why there would even be a <br />
questionnaire on the subject. Glancing around, he saw a plain blue pen sitting on a table, and decided to fill it out <br />
anyway. It was an excuse to waste more time, and it was a subject he'd occasionally thought about.<br />
<br />
Question 1: If you were a girl... would your handwriting be nice?<br />
<br />
An odd question to start with, Doug thought. He didn't particularly care, and his own writing wasn't that bad, <br />
though he preferred to print, so he scribbled 'Same' down and moved on.<br />
<br />
Question 2: If you were a girl... would you like pink?<br />
<br />
Doug snorted. Pink was a repulsive color, and he couldn't imagine why anyone would like it. He knew most girls <br />
preferred it, though, so resisting the urge to write about how much he hated the color, he wrote 'Not particularly; <br />
prefer light blue', as that seemed like a feminine color as well. Unnoticed by him, the blue pen, originally a darker <br />
shade, lightened until it was almost white.<br />
<br />
Question 3: If you were a girl... would your hair be straight or curly?<br />
<br />
Doug much preferred straight, long hair on women, so he wrote 'Straight hair down to just below my shoulder <br />
blades'. Long, but not abnormally so. His once-balding scalp tingled, and he reached up and scratched at it <br />
absent-mindedly, already looking at the next question, when he noticed how long his hair actually was; in a few <br />
seconds it had grown down to his back, and some of it was in his eyes! My hair's never been that long! Okay, <br />
maybe the bangs, but not in the back! he thought, and then with a chill realized that his hair had grown to match <br />
what he had written down. He stared at the questionnaire, and noticed the pen's color change as well; then he <br />
glanced down at the rest of the questions, and noticed one of them had an age option. Then Doug smiled, and <br />
realized he could re-invent his life with this magical slip of paper; Doug tried to be a firm believer in hard work, ever <br />
since he had dropped out of high school when the work load had become too much for the lazy teenager he had <br />
been. With this, he could start over from where he'd left off, and finish high school, and maybe college or university! <br />
Doing so as a girl didn't seem like a bad trade. He looked at the next question.<br />
<br />
Question 4: If you were a girl... would you wear high heels?<br />
<br />
Ugh, no way, he thought; high heels seemed like a bad idea, and he didn't like the thought of learning to walk in <br />
them, and the tripping that would result from it. He scribbled 'No,' intending to write something else down, but then <br />
one of the interns walked in. Doug glanced up, and noticed the man staring at his long, feminine haircut. He <br />
cleared his throat, and the man looked away and sat down at a table across the room, pulling out some paper or <br />
other and getting to work on... something. He seemed to be trying hard to ignore Doug, rather than working on <br />
anything in particular. Doug soon realized he'd need somewhere more private to change, though, so he got up and <br />
went to the janitor's closet; it was more a small room than a closet, and he locked the door behind him. There, this <br />
should be private enough. He sat down in an old, worn chair, and continued the questionnaire.<br />
<br />
Question 5: If you were a girl... would you like ballet?<br />
<br />
Doug frowned. He knew what he was getting into when he'd decided to finish the questionnaire, but his male ego <br />
was offended by the question; he also knew that every little girl he'd met, either as a niece or when he was still in <br />
school himself, had liked, or at least not hated, ballet. He couldn't bring himself to write 'yes', but managed a 'not <br />
really', which was as close as was willing to go. Then he frowned, and read the question again; his earlier <br />
hesitation seemed ridiculous, in hindsight. He shook his head, and moved on.<br />
<br />
Question 6: If you were a girl... would you wear a skirt or dress?<br />
<br />
If the last question had offended him, this one made his cheeks blush. He knew he'd have to get over it; they were <br />
commonly worn by women of many ages, but he didn't like the idea of himself in one. Then he remembered he <br />
wouldn't be a him, he would be a her, and, taking a deep breath, he wrote 'skirts, yes, dresses, preferably not', and <br />
was immediately aware that his jeans suddenly didn't cover all of his legs - and were now, in fact, a knee-length <br />
denim skirt. He gulped, and forced his eyes back to the paper.<br />
<br />
Question 7: If you were a girl... would you wear jewelry?<br />
<br />
This question didn't seem so bad. He thought about what the teenagers today would wear, and wrote down 'Yes, <br />
some bracelets, and an ear piercing,' and immediately noticed a sharp pain in his ears. Glancing around, he saw a <br />
grimy mirror, half hidden behind various cleaning supplies in a corner, and wiped it off. He brushed his hair back <br />
(noticing the various bangles and bracelets around his wrist as he did so) and stared at the simple light blue <br />
sphere poking through his ear, for a second, then turned back towards the paper.<br />
<br />
Question 8: If you were a girl... what size would your breasts be?<br />
<br />
He grinned. It was letting him choose? He thought for a second, and then wrote 'C-cup'. An involuntary yelp <br />
emerged from his lips - noticeably higher-pitched than normal - as the fat on his chest surged forward, forming two <br />
large bumps. He cupped them in his hands, and then blushed and hurriedly let go when he felt his new, still <br />
sensitive breasts complain. Even as he looked down, his eyes were drawn back to the questionnaire - he picked it <br />
up off the floor, where it had fallen, and proceeded to the next question.<br />
<br />
Question 9: If you were a girl... what kind of underwear would you wear?<br />
<br />
At this, Doug's mind went blank. He didn't know what kind of underwear women wore! By now, he just wanted to <br />
get this over with, though, so he wrote 'bikini' and waited. His boxers seemed to melt underneath the skirt - an <br />
unpleasant sensation, even more so when some of the material crawled up his skin, leaving goosebumps, and <br />
settled around his new chest, forming a plain bra, similar in style to a bikini top, while the lower half formed a bikini <br />
bottom, which didn't fit well on his still quite masculine body. Uncomfortable, Doug hurried to the next question:<br />
<br />
Question 10: If you were a girl... would you prefer tampons or pads?<br />
<br />
Doug knew what this question would do, and he welcomed the relief from the pain on his groin the underwear <br />
caused. He barely read the question, once he knew what it was about, and quickly wrote down the first option. The <br />
pain in his groin suddenly vanished, providing the welcome relief, as his penis shrank into his body, forming a hole, <br />
and his testicles moved inwards, becoming ovaries. As the conversion was occurring, he realized what would <br />
happen next, and quickly scribbled down 'don't need at moment' even as the process finished. She waited, but <br />
nothing appeared inside of her, and she didn't feel any pain or cramps. Phew, crisis averted, she thought. <br />
<br />
Question 11: If you were a girl... would you shave?<br />
<br />
Of course! she thought, and wrote it down on the paper; instantly, all of her body hair disintegrated, leaving smooth <br />
skin. She rubbed her chin, where she'd had the beginning of a scraggy beard, and marveled at the smoothness <br />
she found there.<br />
<br />
Question 12: If you were a girl... what color would your hair be?<br />
<br />
Doug thought about this one. Her own hair, now that it was back, was grey, but she remembered once having a full <br />
head of dark brown hair. She'd never particularly like the color of it, especially now, and thought it a bit plain, so <br />
she wrote 'blonde, with light blue streaks', and watched in the mirror as the dry, grey hair lightened and became <br />
blonde, with the light blue streaks going from tip to about an inch before the scalp, where both colors faded to <br />
grey, and with a start realized the light blue streaks were natural.  Interesting...<br />
<br />
Question 13: If you were a girl... what color would your eyes be?<br />
<br />
Fueled by the knowledge the magic wasn't limited to what was physically possible, she thought for a second, and <br />
then wrote 'changes to whatever color I want it to be'. Then she looked in the mirror, at her unassuming brown <br />
eyes, and willed them to turn bright red. Nothing happened for a moment, and she started to turn away, <br />
disappointed, when her eyes started to itch, and then the irises turned a vivid shade of bright red. Grinning, she <br />
quickly cycled through most of the visible light spectrum, including pure white and pure black (both of which were <br />
creepy; she didn't linger on them very long), almost settling on light blue, but finally deciding on a shade of green <br />
that seemed to go with the hair color. <br />
<br />
Question 14: If you were a girl... what kind of shirt would you wear?<br />
<br />
Doug glanced down at the shirt she was currently wearing; it was a worn old plain black t-shirt, which had once <br />
bore the school crest on the left side; worn and faded, the last remnants of the crest had disappeared when her <br />
chest had exploded outward, distorting and stretching the shirt in ways it wasn't meant to take, even new. It fit <br />
poorly around not just the chest, but the waist and hips as well; her waist had shrunken inwards slightly without <br />
her noticing, and her hips and spread outward a little when her groin had changed, although she'd been a bit pre-<br />
occupied at the time to notice. She didn't want to wear something ridiculous like a tube top or a 'half-shirt', <br />
whatever it was called, that bared the midriff, so she just wrote down 'light blue top', and the shirt readjusted to her <br />
more feminine proportions, the wear and tear vanishing, making the shirt seem new, as the neckline formed a V, <br />
showing a bit more skin than the remaining male part of her would like. She didn't dwell on it too long before going <br />
back to the questionnaire.<br />
<br />
Question 15: If you were a girl... would you be into guys?<br />
<br />
Doug had been raised in an old-fashioned, Christian home, and while he had long since abandoned the closed-<br />
mindedness about sexual orientation such an upbringing usually instilled, she was still uncomfortable at the <br />
thought of being bisexual or gay, so she wrote down 'yes' without really thinking what it would mean. Suddenly, <br />
she found that her breasts no longer seemed so strange and wonderous, they were just... there. Curious, she <br />
thought about some of her colleagues, and realized the women no longer seemed so attractive, while she was <br />
disappointed her memory couldn't conjure up more than a hazy image of the male teachers. In particular, that <br />
intern that had walked in on her in the teachers lounge... She shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts, and <br />
moved on to the next question before she starting thinking of... other things.<br />
<br />
Questions 16: If you were a girl... what would be your intelligence, from 1 to 10? (1 being a blonde bimbo and 10 <br />
being a total nerd)<br />
<br />
She felt uncomfortable at the thought this little piece of paper could change how smart or stupid she was... but <br />
then, it could change everything else, couldn't it? All the same, she wanted to keep as much about herself the <br />
same as possible; she estimated herself to be around a 6 or 7, remembering she had dropped out moreso <br />
because of the amount of work high school had required than the difficulty of said work, and wrote '7' on the page. <br />
She didn't feel much different, and thought about a math problem she'd tried to solve the other day before erasing it <br />
from the board; at the time, he'd gotten stuck, and copied the equation down for later before erasing the question <br />
and his work. But now, though, another solution to one of the steps occurred to her, and pulling the scrap paper <br />
out of her bag, she wrote the alternate solution down, and checked to find it was right. It had still been hard, but <br />
not unsolvable to her; she grimaced when she realized she'd overestimated herself. At least I wasn't that far off, <br />
she thought, before crumpling up the paper and tossing it away.<br />
<br />
Question 17: If you were a girl... what would your age, height, and weight without clothes be? (Don't lie)<br />
<br />
Ah, finally, she thought, and wrote down '16, 5' 7&quot;, 120 lbs'. Her whole body erupted into goosebumps again, <br />
before shrinking in size, losing weight and years. The height change was negligible; she'd written what she thought <br />
her height was, and estimated a weight for the average 16 year old girl these days. Not all of the fat disappeared, <br />
though; much of what was on her stomach moved down into her hips and legs, completing the feminine figure that <br />
had started forming from the earlier questions. When the physical change was complete, her clothes readjusted to <br />
fit her new, much slimmer body, and she noticed the neckline deepened to show even more skin, while the skirt <br />
became slightly shorter. Looking in the mirror, she gasped; she seemed almost identical to her sister, from what <br />
she remembered of her when she was 16. The only real difference was the hair and eye color. Shaken, she looked <br />
at the second-last question on the questionnaire:<br />
<br />
Question 18: If you were a girl... how sporty would you be?<br />
<br />
Doug hated sports. She'd hated it in high school, she hated it now. She was an advocate of hard work, but <br />
exercising didn't appeal to her, part of the reason why the last question had removed so much fat. Then she had <br />
an idea, and wrote down 'Not very, but I'd be naturally skinny and muscle-y' Instantly, her muscles became more <br />
toned, and she could feel herself become stronger, although how she knew she didn't know. Two birds with one <br />
stone, she thought, and smiled; the smile turned into a grin when she saw how cute her reflection had become <br />
when she smiled. One last question, and I can start my new life, she thought happily.<br />
<br />
Question 19: Now that you're a girl... will you (and everyone else) remember you as a girl, or as the guy you used <br />
to be?<br />
<br />
She shivered, and wondered if the questionnaire's magic was strong enough to effect everyone she'd ever met, and <br />
herself, that extensively. Why not? It didn't seem to have any limitations so far beyond the restrictions inherent in <br />
distinct questions. She didn't like the thought of giving up who she had been for 57 years of her life, though. And <br />
then she thought of an alternative: She wrote the words 'Everyone else only remembers me as a girl, but I can <br />
remember being a guy and a girl'. She wasn't sure if this would work; but then information started flooding her <br />
brain, memories and skills a teenage girl would have but a old man wouldn't, and she still remembered her old life, <br />
although it seemed dim and less worth holding onto now. The bell rung, startling her out of her rushing thoughts, <br />
and she picked up her little light blue backpack off the floor and headed for what her female memories told her was <br />
her favorite class. Definitely worth it, she thought, and smiled at the paper; as she did so, she noticed more words <br />
appearing beneath the questions. She read them as she hurried down the hallway; her class was on the other side <br />
of the school.<br />
<br />
The words read: Very clever, miss 'Doug'. I'll let it pass, since you were willing to finish me without prodding. If you <br />
want to live a happy life as a girl, though, you'll pass me onto someone else, boy or girl, before the day ends.<br />
<br />
By the way, Doug isn't a very feminine name, is it?<br />
Question 20: If you were a girl... what would your name be?<br />
<br />
She almost tripped and stopped walking when the paper referred to both itself and her little trick with the last <br />
question. She wondered if the 'passing on' business was standard, or something especially for her; she wasn't <br />
likely to find out, though, so she took her favorite pen - no, the teachers lounge pen - out of her bag where she'd <br />
put it, and wrote the name from her female memories on the last line. The question disappeared, and all of the <br />
'Doug's on the page briefly turned to 'Susan's before the questionnaire wiped itself clean of her answers. As she <br />
stared at the empty questionnaire, a boy walking past her tripped on one of his shoelaces, and the pile of books in <br />
his arms spilled everywhere. She stopped, and helped him pick up his books; she noticed that he looked close to <br />
tears, and not from the fall. Deciding quickly, she slipped the questionnaire between two of his books as she <br />
passed them back to him, then smiled and went on towards her class.</p>
