<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>As Deckard sits at his desk, in his black leather office chair, he turns to look at Brad. Deckard had to admit that Brad was a very good looking guy. Deckard never really knew if he was gay or not, as he found women attractive, both in beauty and sexually, but he always found himself studying the male form, both in life and in pornography. Deckard looks Brad over, hoping that Brad would be oblivious to what he was doing, and it seemed that Brad was oblivious, as he read over the computer screen sitting on Deckard's desk. Deckard turned around in his chair, faced the computer screen and grinned. In his mind, he could see how they would be good friends as he knew that Lupin's were a loyal group that made friends for life. Something did perk an interest though, last minute as it was, as he recounted his observations of Brad's form. As odd as it may have been, Deckard could have sworn that Brad's eyes were luminescent, or glowing slightly, and his clothes all seemed a size smaller than what he should have been wearing. Deck, as he liked to be called, didn't have a problem with the extra showing of Brad's unseen features. Slowly, Deck's mind focused on the tightness in Brad's jean shorts, showing off what would have to be a very large package... then something Deck never experienced before made itself present in his mind, he could imagine himself playing with Brad's package, even having his way with Brad.</br>
<br>Deck found that his own package had swollen and he needed to adjust himself. Deck quickly raised up off the seat, jiggled and sat back down, all while hoping Brad wouldn't get suspicious of his actions. Deck shakes off the feelings and focuses back on the computer screen, reading the latest paper on summoning magic.</br>
<br>Brad walks closer behind Deck to get a better look at what he was reading, even though he could see it perfectly from where he had been standing. When Brad was right against Deck, Brad rubbed his chest, noticing a bit of tenderness, realizing he was close to change into his Lycan form, but for some reason, the change was remaining mainly dormant. This was the first time anything like this had happened to Brad, that he could recall ever since he began transforming. Brad knew that the moon had to be out, because he could smell the scent he put out to arouse those around him. Brad quickly sniffed the air, noticing that there were two different scents. One he could make out as his own, the other was coming from Deck. Brad's eyes widened, realizing that Deck could quite possibly be his "mate" or "life partner" as his species took.</br>
<br>Brad recalled hearing stories from his father about how he encountered this experience the first time. His father told Brad he could change when he wanted, into either form, but was forced to during the full moon, and during that time he would be able to find his "mate". During that time, everything about his three forms would be accentuated and bigger. Brad's father told him about the night he met Brad's mother. He was in the middle of a forced change, when suddenly, someone walked by the cave where he had been hiding. He told Brad that he could smell the scent of a woman and that his change had been halted. Curious to the occurrence, Brad;s father stalked the person that walked by, following her scent and when he finally came upon her, he just knew that she must have been the one. He told Brad that his mother sensed his presence there, turning around to stare him in the face, but instead of screaming like most humans would, she began to pet his head. From that point on, he changed her into his species and then she had Brad.</br>
<br>Brad knew this must be the same deal, especially since he felt a strange draw to Deck at the moment he first saw him. Brad had to know for sure, and he placed his hands on Deck's shoulders and began giving a massage. Brad could feel Deck's tense muscles melt with his touch. Brad leaned in closer, taking a quick look down Deck's front parts to see if his suspicions were true. Sure enough, Brad could see a bulge straining against Deck's pants. Brad wanted to take it one step further. Brad grabbed Deck's shoulders and spun him around in his chair, pulling Deck from his studies. During the spin, Deck became frustrated quickly, scoffing, but silence befell him as he stared face to face with whom he thought was still Brad inside.</br>
<Br>Deck saw, what he would guess, was a partial transformation. Brads face was pushed out slightly into a muzzle, his teeth were somewhat sharper than a Lupin's while in human form, there was a small amount of black fur on his exposed hands, arms, neck, and legs. Brad's chest was definitely larger, more defined, as were all his other muscles.</Br>
<br>"So Deck" He saidin his deeper, guttural voice. "Do you like what you see before you?"</br>
<br>"I... I don't know how to answer that! If I said yes, you could beat me into a bloody pulp because it's a queer statement. If I said no, I could offend you and the result would be the same... or even worse, you could eat me."</br>
<br>Brad smiled at the thought of eating Deck, instilling a fear in Deck when he caught on to the different kind of grin. "Well there is nothing to fear here Deck. My species, which you prolly don't know, mates with both males and females. There is no sexuality about it, it is just who we are. Some of my kind only mate with females, some only mate with males, a few will mate with both. So I will ask you again, since you have this new knowledge, do you like what you see before you?"</br>
<br>There was a long pause before Deck spoke, but his looks were more than enough of an answer, especially when Deck looked him up and down five times with a sheepish grin, bigger than the last, each time he started again. "Yes, I definitely like what I see... and that would also confirm the thoughts I have been having about myself lately. I am gay and with you, that's okay."</br>
<br>"Well... that is quite alright with me, as I knew I have always enjoyed the male form much more than a woman's. This is also a good thing to know about the two of us. I just have one more question for you, but I will preface it with some detail. On nights like this, during the full moon, my species is able to give people the gift of the Lycan and I was wondering if you would like that gift!"</br></p>
