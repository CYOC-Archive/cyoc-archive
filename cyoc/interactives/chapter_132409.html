<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zossie woke up thanks to the sun superheating her blinds and causing a sweaty and mucky feeling to overtake the room. She smacked her dry lips and groaned realizing she’d slept in. And by slept in that meant a solitary hour. It was eight in the morning and Zossie felt super rested and peeled herself off the sheets rather happily. It had been a good sleep and she wasn’t sore or stiff at all. Despite this she still did a series of morning stretches before silently exiting her room with feet so silent she had to be related to Haley. She entered the bathroom and the morning routine began. Showering, waxing her legs, doing her hair, getting dressed, and finally applying makeup. She then ate breakfast and sat down in the living room. She began to strum her guitar and hum to herself while the smell of damp air carried into the window. Mom and dad were gone so she had no worries about waking anyone up and it just so happened that Haley was already awake and reading in her bedroom.<br />
<br />
Zossie got to practice until well after noon had passed and by that point she was fully into her music. She probably wouldn’t have noticed Haley come downstairs if the two hadn’t developed the skills necessary to see ninjas based on their quiet footfalls. Haley probably just wanted water but Zossie decided to randomly call out to her.<br />
<br />
“And Haley take the mike!” Zossie shouted before continuing to strum and singing a love melody. Her sister blushed heavily but Zossie continued to stare at her so Haley walked up and began to sing quietly next to her. Their voices mixed but it was mostly Zossie doing the singing, or at least at first. Haley’s singing voice began to get louder and louder as flaws hammered themselves out. She went from awkwardly singing to closing her eyes and smiling. She was suddenly singing just as beautifully as Zossie and seemed to be into it. A glass of water appeared on the chair next to Zossie and Haley’s book went upstairs while the girl took a seat and they both thought they’d been there for hours. Music erupted from their mouths and their clothing began to change becoming finer and finer as Zossie’s clothing shifted into a neat summer dress and Haley’s changed into an equally neat one. Their makeup changed and became ten times better while their hair began to look professionally done. The plants in the living room began to move with the singing and change into exotic and large plants that wafted out pleasant smells. Furniture began to grow cleaner and newer while the floors lost scuff marks. The girls continued to sing and their singing just got better and better as the living room began to expand and split. The chair Haley was on became a solid black bench while Zossie found herself on a stool.<br />
<br />
The windows became wide and covered the area from the roof to the floor and the drapes became thin and flowing. The furniture in the room got even more stylized, expensive looking, and it even multiplied. Zossie suddenly held her guitar strangely and it began to expand and grow changing shape and gaining more strings as she began to play it differently. Neither girl reacted and the guitar had changed into a beautiful harp a few seconds later that Zossie was strumming expertly. Her playing seemed to get better with each passing second while her voice continued to change and get more and more beautiful. The girls continued to sing while the house expanded more and more with rooms changing and being filled with expensive decorations and small insects shuddering and halting.<br />
<br />
 A spider began to grow in size and lose legs as it took on a human shape. It’s eyes glazed over and it stood up straight while a suit formed on it and a masculine body shape emerged. It got older and became more stoic before transforming Into a butler. Mice in the kitchen began to grow taller and take on feminine characteristics as they turned into young cooks, maids, and servants. Outside a cricket transformed into a burly gardener and the house began to squeeze up against houses nearby choking them for space. The house got larger and larger and the floor in the music room changed into clean hardwood. Haley’s fingers began to move as dust collected below her and began to expand and grow into a massive grand piano. It began to tune itself and the music only intensified because of it. The sisters continued to sing as the outdoors got hazy and the wind gusting in got cold. The windows shut as a snowy landscape emerged on the horizon and the girls had their accents change. The English remained but suddenly they had beautiful French accents in their singing and their home continued to expand and shift until it was a massive mansion on a mountain in France. It did get warmer during the summer but snow always remained on the grounds. The girls continued to sing and their clothing changed to match their new environment. Both girls had their wardrobes shifted as they got more and more clothing and their closets became walk ins. Their beautiful voices changed their lives and in order to remain valedictorian at their new high class academy for girls Haley became incredibly smart. Able to do complex math without a calculator, memorize things easily, and write an essay so flawlessly that it had been published. She was still socially awkward and nervous but now had a singsong voice that only emerged when singing with her sister. Otherwise she just nervously played gorgeous melodies on the piano.<br />
<br />
Zossie also went through changes to her life and memories. Now she was the daughter of a billionaire CEO and had been trained by the best musicians in the world. She suddenly had knowledge of how to expertly play thirty two separate instruments, though the harp was her favourite, and had been invited to play in symphony orchestras for film soundtracks before due to her talent.<br />
<br />
The family had a multitude of homes around the world but they were currently staying in their home in France and both girls began to sing in their native French, though they also knew English just as well seeing as their mother was now one of the best English teachers in the world teaching at the university of Oxford and having taught royalty how to speak it. Their parents had met when they were both students and had an array of beautiful daughters. Veronica was the oldest and had already found herself as a doctor. Their daughter Jezelle wasn’t talked about much as she’d gotten pregnant several times and gotten into trouble with the law on multiple occasions. Dad had practically given up on her. Then there were Candice and Isabella. One was probably going to be an astronaut one day while the other was on her way to becoming a very versatile and great artist. This left Zossie and Haley who were both socially awkward shy girls who had a knack for music, though Zossie was the only one public about it. But they loved playing together and while Haley had a much greater interest in reading and school than Zossie she was practically as talented when it came to singing and it was rumoured that their duets made anyone who heard it more beautiful and altered objects so they were more successful and worth more. However that was just a rumour and had no solid proof.<br />
<br />
The girls concluded their duet and Haley excused herself to go upstairs. Zossie strummed her harp for a little longer feeling completely content while watching the snowy ground outside the windows. Archie, the butler brought her lunch around noon and she spent the rest of the day playing around with various instruments and original compositions.</p>
