<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, the doorbell kept ringing over and over and over again as the new maid impatiently waited outside for someone to answer it. But with no human being there to do so, things were already starting off on the wrong foot. <br />
<br />
It was up to Jen to answer the door, as Mistress was barking non-stop, and making enjoying the early morning quiet very hard to do. So Jen wheeled herself over and opened the door in a way that didn&#39;t reveal herself quite yet. The new maid just huffed and walked inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello? I&#39;m the new maid. Is anyone here?&quot; Shouted the new maid in the same bitchy-whining voice of an annoyed teen that Jen was all to familiar with. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Hellooooo? Like, what am I supposed to I do about the dog?&quot; Continued the maid as she started looking for someone to talk to. Jen finally saw who it was and her face lit up with delight. It was her former cheerleading captain who had graduated last year, as well as her first, best, and only serious lesbian experience to date. Olivia Statton.<br />
<br />
While Jen used to be known as the hottest girl in school before she made herself a sentient 2in1 appliance, she was actually second only to Olivia up until she graduated. Olivia had the golden ratio of bodily proportions, was fairly tall for a girl, and seemed to love and be loved by just about everyone that took the time to get to know her. But she was also a total stuckup bitch in the eyes of those who didn&#39;t do so. If Jen was the school&#39;s Queen, then Olivia was the Empress. And Jen already knew exactly what she would turn her into as well.<br />
<br />
Taking Olivia by surprise was easy enough, though getting Mistress to not try and run off with one of her limbs in her mouth was not so much. So Jen sent her Mom outside to play in the backyard for a while as it was enclosed in a tall, stone fence and out of the public&#39;s eyes. That being said, the public would soon be getting a great view of the house&#39;s newest addition soon enough. <br />
<br />
Jen recollected the drool covered body parts that Mistress has stolen and went to work by first removing the front door to the house completely. She also removed their door bell and knocker too.  <br />
<br />
It was easy to pop out the small glass window in the center of the upper half of the door, and Jen made short work of spreading Olivia&#39;s face over it and popped it back in place on the door. She then inserted the knocker into the backside of Olivia&#39;s tits and reattached them to the door as well. <br />
<br />
Jen removed Olivia&#39;s clit and turned it into the door bell button, while she molded the rest of her pussy around the keyhole. Which she then returned back onto her body&#39;s ass. Jen took the entire hips area of Olivia, from her bellybutton down to her knees, and pressed it against the front of the door so that it stuck out and spread her cheeks with her thighs placed while doing a split to either side. The &quot;keyhole&quot; and the &quot;deadbolt&quot; hole now pointed directly forwards and were unobstructed from sight.<br />
<br />
The door didn&#39;t need a handle anymore, as Olivia would be able to freely rotate on her hinges at will, if she was left unlocked. But Jen had some spare body parts leftover, so she stuck the arms and lower legs onto the backside of the door as reinforced bracing for when she was locked. If unlocked, Olivia would pull her limbs in, allowing the door to swing open through the door frame. But if locked, then she would extend them downwards, and brace herself using the floor.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Jen put the door camera inside of Olivia&#39;s left eye and the small security light into the other.  Then remounted her onto the door hinges and closed her shut. Jen then called out to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s so good to see you again Olivia!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen? Holy fuck, that&#39;s right! This you&#39;re house! What are the odds that I would be installed on your house of all places? Wait, just give me a sec.&quot; Jen then heard Olivia let out a loud moan as a clunk sound came from the door. Then Olivia swung herself open and looked down at Jen in delight. Wow, you still look good. I see that you even recieved an upgrade since we last saw eachother too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, nah, I&#39;m still the same. Just well kept is all&quot; replied Jen. <br />
<br />
&quot;True, you are half powerwasher after all. Ooh, I guess that means you&#39;ll be squirting all over my face once again too. God have I missed giving you your pussy juice fountain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen, a little embarrassed by remembering how intricate Olivia&#39;s knowledge was about how to make her body do things she herself didn&#39;t even know was possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, give me a squirt for old time sake. I think my keyholes and mouth need a good rinsing&quot; requested Olivia without even a shred of shame or hesitation. That was just how she was though. Unparalleled self confidence and no sense of shame when asking for something she wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m certain your holes are self cleaning, Olivia&quot; retorted Jen with a teasing smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up and just hose me down with your juices already!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine fine, I will&quot; conceded Jen. She rolled herself outside and got herself ready while Olivia closed herself shut. Jen then gave her a good cleaning, spraying down every inch of her. Jen then sucked up all the puddles and wet spots left on Olivia and also dried her off by reversing the air flow. <br />
<br />
When Olivia was all dry, Jen went back inside and Olivia stayed open so they could speak some more. After chatting for a good hour, Jen had to start her chores, since she yet again turned the new maid into some kind of furniture. But as no one lived inside the house, there wasn&#39;t a lot of mess to clean up. Just whatever mess Mistress made was really all she had to clean actually. <br />
<br />
She still had Olivia close herself and lock up, just to be safe. But only after Olivia mad her promise to spend some time &quot;deep cleaning&quot; her every few days or so. Jen finished with her chores and brought Mistress back inside and sent her straight to her husband for a thurogh bath, as she was all covered in mud. Brenda also helped to clean her hair, since it was all mangled and knotted. And of course Mistress helped herself to a refreshing drink from Susan afterwards, followed by Brenda giving Susan a flush so she could refill her pussy. <br />
<br />
The rest of the day went mostly uneventful, that was until Olivia&#39;s boobs were grabbed and slammed against her. Her clit was then pressed a few times, causing her to loudly moan out in a melodic little tune several times. Her keyholes were slowly being lubricated the more iterations of the same tune she was made to moan-sing. But of course, no one was technically home, so her moan-singing was never answered. <br />
<br />
Finally when the songs were over with, Olivia was able to ask her persistant ringer who they were, and what business did they have inside her house.</p>
