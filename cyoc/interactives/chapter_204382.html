<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the way back to class Aaron looked around at the other students returning with him expecting them to be staring at him as he felt exposed in his crossdressing attire, but nobody seemed to pay him much mind. Everyone looked perfectly happy chatting amongst themselves dressed in their own crossdressing attire. Arron was almost back to class when Rita came up from behind him and spooked him by tapping him on his shoulder. <br />
<br />
“I knew you were going to look good in the school uniform” said Rita as Aaron turned to see her<br />
<br />
“Don’t do that, you scared me Rita” responded Aaron as he took in her masculine uniform that mostly hid her modest breasts. Her hair was now much shorter than before the change and she can off as very androgynous compared to Aaron’s definitely feminine appearance.<br />
<br />
“Oh come on Aaron I just tapped your shoulder, don’t go getting your panties in a twist” joked Rita putting emphasis on the panties part.<br />
<br />
“This is a mistake Rita I shouldn’t be dressed like this” answered Aaron in an almost pleading voice as shame and panic started to build inside him. Picking up on the growing emotion in Aaron’s voice Rita changed her tone to reassuring and sympathetic saying <br />
“I’m sorry Aaron I was only teasing. I know that it wasn’t easy for you to follow me to St. Paul’s given the crossdressing policy but I swear to you that you will love it here”<br />
<br />
“You don’t know that Rita. I feel ridiculous in this outfit. I can’t believe nobody is laughing at me right now” retorted Aaron <br />
<br />
“What are you talking about Arron, have you seen yourself you look perfect in the uniform and nobody here would laugh at you even if you didn’t” answered Rita with a full confidence in her statement. <br />
<br />
“I need to go to the bathroom really quick. I’ll See you in class” said Aaron as the realization that he didn’t actually know what he looked like right then crashed over him. Rita reluctantly let him go as she still wanted to cheer him up and he zipped off to the nearest bathroom. <br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom Aaron spotted a sink and hurried over to it. On the wall above the sink was a large mirror and Aaron got his first look at his full appearance of his crossdressing self. It was stunning to Aaron how a few minor tweaks to how he did his hair and a little bit of makeup had made him almost unrecognizable from a girl. He couldn’t believe it at first thinking that the mirror had to be a window showing a girl in another room but no the image was of him. No wonder Rita was so confident, he looked amazing. Aaron would have stayed in the bathroom longer inspecting himself longer had the bell not then rung forcing him to leave in a rush back towards class. <br />
<br />
Rita had stalled for him and Aaron was able to get to class before role call had started and he wasn’t marked tardy. The rest of the class was normal to any classes first day with the teacher going over the classes contents and goals and all the students introducing themselves. Even though everyone in class was crossdressing the introductions didn’t seem flipped with the boys having girly interests and the girls having boyish interests, instead the interests of the students were a balanced mix. During the introductions Aaron had been nervous and gave only reading as a interest but when he was done the student next to him a boy named Sam who had said his interest was makeup and face paint art leaned over to him a quietly complimented Aaron on his makeup. Aaron immediately blushed at the compliment and took it as high praise from Sam who had impeccable makeup on at the time. <br />
<br />
Aaron and Sam would chat with each other for the rest of class making Aaron forget about his initial nervousness with his new predicament. In the next class Rita sat closer to Aaron but sadly Sam wasn’t in the same class as them. This class was uneventful with Aaron and Rita only chatting a little bit. The next class for Aaron was gym but Rita’s next class was math so they split ways leaving Aaron alone in the strange school. <br />
<br />
Aaron thought he would be alone until he met back up with Rita during lunch but was surprised to find Sam in his gym class changing into girl’s gym clothes alongside all the other boys. Sam waved Aaron over and the two talked a little while they finished changing. To Aaron’s surprise Sam finished his outfit off by stuffing his sports bra with two plastic B cup inserts. The inserts made the already cute a feminine Sam even more girly. Aaron could feel the beginnings of an erection start to form in his tight panties and bloomers and had to look away from Sam to stop himself. <br />
<br />
Aaron left the changing room first and Sam followed soon after. The gym class started with a few laps and Sam ran along with Aaron for the entire time. During the laps Aaron couldn’t help but notice the giggle in Sam’s chest caused by the inserts hidden their. Aaron wasn’t the only person that noticed it and after the laps the gym teacher stopped Sam and confiscated the inserts saying they were against the school’s rules and the they would be in the principal’s office after school. Sam complained about the confiscation to Aaron for the rest of the class arguing that now that the crossdressing policy was permanent the dress code should be expanded to allow for false breasts for the guys and false bulges for the girls. <br />
<br />
After gym was lunch and Rita rejoined Aaron to show him the cafeteria. Sam joined them as well and chatted with both Aaron and Rita. Sam even convinced Rita that she would look amazing with a false bulge denting her crotch. All three eat together and laughed and joked around like they had all been friends for years. When lunch was over it was time for the final class of the day. Aaron was alone for this class with both Sam and Rita having different classes at the time. Aaron was a little nervous without them but the class went fine with everyone being perfectly kind to him. <br />
<br />
With the final bell rung Aaron left his last class and remembered his phone was at the principal’s office. Once he was their getting his phone back was an easy matter. Just after receiving his phone Sam showed up to the principal’s office to get his inserts back and Rita had followed him knowing Aaron would be there for his phone.<br />
<br />
Opening up his phone Aaron was greeted by the app that had changed his reality. At the beginning of the change Aaron had wanted nothing more than to change everything back but after the day he had just had he wasn’t so sure he wanted to go back. Regardless of if he wanted to go back or not Aaron was still curious as to what can be done with the app so he picks a target and generates a new sentence </p>
