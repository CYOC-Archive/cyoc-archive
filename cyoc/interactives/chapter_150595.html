<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay pressed send on his angrily worded message on AeAeA&#39;s complaint&#39;s section of their website while waiting for his hook-up of the night to come back from the bathroom. What was supposed to be the next two-week&#39;s supply was now useless, built for someone way less gifted than Jay. Stupid AeAeA.<br />
All of Jay&#39;s friends always seemed to get exactly what they needed from the site, although Jay couldn&#39;t recall what his friend Michael wore before he ordered his six-armed shirt (an AeAeA exclusive) and had full mobility of all eight limbs. He also knew that Dennis in the Delta Phi House ordered his assless-chaps in bulk there, though it was rare Dennis would wear anything covering up that constantly slick asshole of his, especially around other frat guys. So Jay was sorely disappointed when he saw that &quot;100% satisfaction&quot; promise on the website and was delivered a massive box of condoms that could barely fit around his index finger. <br />
Jay bought the box to share between himself and his mates. The four of them made up the leaders of Gamma House, notorious for being the most fuckable on campus. And now they were down any protection (not that a lack of condoms had ever stopped them in the past).<br />
<br />
Jay was just about to close out of the email app on his phone when an auto-reply from AeAeA greeted him. <br />
&quot;We&#39;re sorry that you are unsatisfied with your order. In 24 hours we will send you a return label for free shipping back to our stores. When it is back in our stock you will get a full refund. Otherwise, feel free to keep the product and we will be happy to double your order next time.<br />
Best, <br />
C.C. Helios (CEO/Owner of AeAeA Men&#39;s Collection)&quot;<br />
Jay was happy to see he had won. If there was one thing that Jay hated more than being treated like a pussy, it was being treated like an idiot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jay?&quot; a voice cried from the hallway. Jay&#39;s roommate and best friend Nate stumbled in. He was scratching at his bare chest, tugging some sorority girl behind him. Her name was probably either Stacey or Tammy or Ronnie or something of that kind. Unless that was the name of the girl in the bathroom that Jay was waiting for. Nate reached out his hand and in a harsh whisper just said &quot;rubber, pleaseee.&quot; The smell of vodka wafted from Nate&#39;s breath. Jay, looking forward to having a joke at Nate&#39;s expense, handed him a handful of the extra smalls. <br />
&quot;Go nuts, Nate,&quot; Jay said. Nate nodded and walked back out of the room, closing the door behind him. <br />
<br />
Out from the bathroom walked Xxxxxxxx (Jay blamed the rum for forgetting her name), wearing only a bra and thong at this point. She lightly pulled her panties off as Jay watched, his cock throbbing. Xxxxxxx (maybe it was Jennica?) walked over to Jay and without saying a word pulled his boxers off. In the background, the music of the party downstairs grew louder but Jay didn&#39;t mind. Xxxxxxx threw her lips over Jay&#39;s erection, causing him to twitch instantly. <br />
Jay&#39;s proudest achievement was having the largest dick in Gamma. During his hazing ritual five years ago, everyone was amazed at just how much Jay dominated during the naked mile, not only running faster than everyone else but looking better doing it, too. On the only 6&#39;0 frame it looked even more massive. He grew a reputation, and ladies often tried to conquer the beast Jay carried around with him at all times. <br />
On that part, Xxxxxxx seemed to be doing a great job. It took a few attempts, but she had managed to get about halfway down the 11&#39; shaft without gagging. Jay was impressed. He leaned forward and whispered into her ear &quot;You on the pill?&quot; and the girl nodded. &quot;Good, my condom&#39;s don&#39; t fit. I&#39;ll pull out, don&#39;t worry.&quot; Xxxxxxx smiled and pulled her lips away from Jay&#39;s dick, sliding up his chest. She kissed Jay, and Jay licked at his own precum. It tasted slightly different than usual. When Jay looked down, his penis even looked a little bit different, perkier than usual. <br />
The girl mounted Jay, riding him as Jay laid on his bed. &quot;She must do yoga,&quot; Jay thought to himself, &quot;Impressive.&quot; The position that Xxxxxxx (Jay remembered a Mel, but was that last night or tonight?) found herself in would have been impossible for other girls, but this one was special. She rode up and down on Jay&#39;s erect cock, her breasts bouncing on her chest. Jay kissed her tits, leaning forward. The girl&#39;s expression changed, becoming a bit more quizzical. She shifted in her positioning and Jay looked at her. &quot;Hey, baby, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
&quot;I dunno...&quot; she said. &quot;I was just surprised that you seemed to slip out of me. Weird position I think.&quot;<br />
Jay reached down and felt the base of his cock, still making contact with her pussy. &quot;No, we&#39;re fine. Trust me, this is great.&quot; Jay kept kissing the girl as she made a grunt of agreement. The girl reached around Jay and gripped his ass, thrusting Jay deeper into her and spreading his asscheeks. And Jay felt that. Heavily. <br />
<br />
Jay came quicker than he may have ever done so in his life. He felt so much lighter like he hadn&#39;t cum since he was in 8th grade. He gasped, making a noise foreign to him even. The girl gasped and then pushed against Jay.<br />
&quot;Did you just finish inside of me??!!&quot; She screamed. Jay was equally shocked. He usually had much better control. He knew his dick better than he knew his social security number. Xxxxxxx again hit at Jay and stood up, shuffling off to the bathroom. &quot;You&#39;re a fucking pig, Jayson.&quot;<br />
Jay could barely even disagree. He felt so awkward, and while that wasn&#39;t the best sex of his life it felt like it could have been. Jay rolled over and grabbed some tissues, preparing to clean himself up. But when he reached down to his dick, he realized why everything felt so different. <br />
<br />
---- ---- ----<br />
<br />
8.2 inches. Hard. That&#39;s what Jay measured as soon as he had kicked the chick out of his room. Jay wanted to know what that equated to soft, but he hadn&#39;t gotten out of this level of horniness since he came. It was the scariest thing in the world. Jay looked at himself in the bathroom mirror with the tape measure still in his hand, and he saw how his balls were clearly the same size, and the girth of his dick wasn&#39;t much different. But his penis was obviously shorter. <br />
Jay tried to text his friend Mat, but he couldn&#39;t press the send button. Literally. It was like writing the message &quot;hey wtf my dick shrankk help&quot; was impossible to send. He tried to call 911 but didn&#39;t have the willpower to dial. It was so strange. Jay tried to talk about it, but nothing happened. <br />
Jay went back to his bed and turned out the lights, locking his door. He tried to sleep. Maybe he was just sick. But the smaller erection in his sheets still pulsated. The blood flow seemed not to have changed. Jay reached down and attempted to re-adjust his cock, although it was like a phantom limb that wouldn&#39;t move, especially as rock hard as he was. <br />
But with an accidental pull in the wrong direction, Jay set his cock off like a rocket once again. He spewed all over the sheet, again feeling like he was releasing everything he had inside of him. And staring down at the space where he had previously had a python, he witnessed his penis shrink. It was almost as if every extra thrust into his sheet took a millimeter off, and he was still cumming so much. Without examining it closer Jay thought he may be at only 4 inches now. In other words, he had lost more than half of his original dick size. Now it was thinner too, reedier. And still hard. <br />
In the darkness, Jay reached for his phone. But instead, his hand found something else: the box of condoms. Suspicious, Jay opened one of the condoms. He rolled it over his penis, finding it to fit perfectly. In fact, it might have been a bit too big. <br />
Jay fell asleep with the condom still wrapped around his penis, a block from any other stimulus. No silk sheets or accidental brush with his hand in his sleep. Jay just needed to rest and everything would be fine.<br />
<br />
---- ---- ----<br />
<br />
Jay woke up and discovered that everything was worse.</p>
