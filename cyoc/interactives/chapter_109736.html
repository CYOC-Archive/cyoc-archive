<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yes, you can turn us back to humans, undo all the things you had made and disappear forever.&quot; George said.<br />
&quot;mm... It&#39;s a possibility&quot; Loki said seriously. &quot;At least, I&#39;ll turn you back to humans. I don&#39;t like to talk with animals.&quot; Loki used his magic and both bulls turned back to humans.They were naked, so they covered their genitals with their hands. George had a notable bulge on his groin, but Thomas&#39; one was small and childish but that wasn&#39;t a surprise since he was almost a foot smaller than his brother. &quot;As bulls you looked almost identical. As humans you have some differences. But I...&quot;<br />
&quot;Run!&quot; George shouted before Loki was even able to said anything. &quot;Thomas, run!!&quot;<br />
They tried to run away but Thomas was way more slower than George who ran very fast from his football experience. They ran to a staircase and tried to descend as fast as they can but as time passed, Thomas and George&#39;s gap was increasing. After some time, Thomas was too far from his brother that he looked like an action figure.<br />
&quot;George...&quot; Thomas hesitated. &quot;I can&#39;t... I can&#39;t... I can&#39;t run as fast as you! Don&#39;t leave me behind!&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry! He won&#39;t!&quot; Loki said as he appeared in front of Thomas. &quot;He&#39;s just here&quot;<br />
Loki extended his left arm and picked the running George as if he was near to him despite he was far away. After doing that, Thomas realized that George had got the size he was seeing his brother for far away right in front of him.<br />
&quot;What did you do to him?!&quot; Thomas yelled. &quot;He&#39;s tiny! Like an action figure!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know! Cool, right?!&quot; Loki said with a big grin on his face.<br />
To be honest, it was a little bit cool, Thomas thought. He loved action figures and had a collection he had started a few years ago. Even, he had fantasized about having an action figure who resembles to his brother because he admired him so much. Eventhough, that wasn&#39;t right. There is nothing right in turning George to the size of an action figure.<br />
&quot;Turn him back...&quot; George said. &quot;Please..&quot;<br />
Loki heard some doubt in his way of talking. He hadn&#39;t yelled like had made before. He looked exhausted from all the running, but he wasn&#39;t too tired to don&#39;t yell if it was necesary. Maybe he wanted his brother in that way and that was a great opportunity for Loki to take advantage of the situation.<br />
&quot;You like action figures, don&#39;t you?&quot; Loki said. &quot;And you like how your brother looks like one now, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Thomas!&quot; George yelled in his tiny voice, he sounded funny like an squirrel. &quot;Thomas!&quot; He was shouting Thomas&#39; name but the boy was lost in his thoughts.<br />
&quot;I... do.&quot; Thomas finally said. &quot;I like action figures... I use to be bullied because of things like that... even George has made some comments saying it&#39;s a waste of time, but... but... I like to do it anyway!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow! That&#39;s the attitude, little brother.&quot; Loki said with a smile. &quot;I like you, you&#39;re really a good company and we can have a good time together. What do you think?&quot;<br />
It&#39;s terrible! Thomas thought immediately. But I can&#39;t defy a god, so I need to be way more clever than him, that&#39;s the only way we can leave here safely. &quot;Ok, Loki.&quot; Thomas finally said. &quot;I will play with you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Excellent!&quot; Loki said. &quot;And now... any suggestions?&quot;<br />
Thomas looked at his tiny brother trapped between Loki&#39;s fingers. Try to rescue him right now was a stupid idea, he needed to wait for a good opportunity, but that doesn&#39;t mean that he can&#39;t play with his brother like he was a regular action figure.<br />
&quot;What do you think if we play action figures?&quot; Thomas said. &quot;I have a few more in my house...&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. We can use Momo&quot; Loki said, at the moment they returned to the room where Momo was caged and Loki used his magic to reduce him to a doll size. &quot;I will use him, you can use your brother.&quot;<br />
Loki threw the human doll to Thomas&#39; hand who needed to be a good catcher if he don&#39;t want to hurt his brother.<br />
&quot;But he&#39;s naked.&quot; Thomas said. &quot;Why don&#39;t you give him some clothes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot; Loki snapped his fingers and a tiny cowboy uniform appeared in Thomas&#39; hands. He gave the clothes to his brother who used them to dress him but Loki didn&#39;t agree with that. &quot;Hey! He&#39;s your figure! You must dress him!&quot;<br />
&quot;But he can do it by himself...&quot; Thomas said.<br />
&quot;I need to do something about that.&quot; Loki said and snapped his fingers. At the moment, George became rigid like he was frozen.&quot;Now he can&#39;t move. Although you can move him like a regular articulated doll. And talking about dolls... He needs some other changes too...&quot; He snapped again and all George&#39;s body hair fell from his body leaving him with a smooth body like rubber. &quot;And another thing...&quot; Loki snapped a third time and George&#39;s dick and penis receded in his groin until they were completely gone. &quot;Now he is like any other action figure. Eventhough he still has his voice.&quot;<br />
&quot;What the?!&quot; Was the only thing that Thomas said. He wanted to yell at Loki but that could ruin his plan. &quot;Anyway... he isn&#39;t complaining.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s because his voice is so small.&quot; Loki said. &quot;Maybe I need to increase his voice...&quot;<br />
&quot;You fucking traitor!&quot; Was the first thing that George said when he was finally heard. &quot;I thought you&#39;re my brother! But you prefered to play with me to made your fetishes real! I knew you had some gay interest on me but I never thought you were capable of something like this!&quot;<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s better to reduce his voice again...&quot; Loki said and George&#39;s voice reduced as he was insulting his little brother. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Thomas. My big brother is such a jerk too. But, hey! You have me to play! Consider me a friend if you want!&quot;</p>
