<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zoe in Sally&#39;s body continued to hold Calvin in place as he briefly explained the remotes purpose. Sally&#39;s hotty tone trailed off as she pondered what she&#39;d just been told. Small questions began to buzz at the edge of her mind. Simple truths she&#39;d always accepted suddenly brought into question. <br />
<br />
She knew she was older then her body portrayed. All other women&#39;s breasts only produced milk, and only when they were pregnant. If Calvin was their mother, who was their father and how were they born to someone younger then them? She&#39;d never heard of other families using their dicks like tables.<br />
<br />
Calvin gulped as Sally&#39;s expression became that of intrigue and her hand retrieved the remote from between her icy breasts. She examined the device, furrowing her brow picking up on the someone simple buttons. <br />
<br />
She found a simple option and pointed it at her two headed MILF lover Zoe. With a pop her second head vanished and the original shifted back to the center of her body! <br />
<br />
She gasped and restrained herself from dropping the remote. &quot;It works...&quot; Was all Sally could murmur in stunned disbelief. Zoe looked puzzled but it wasn&#39;t at her own body her attention was cast too. &quot;Huh? What&#39;d you say? It works? What&#39;d you do?&quot; Zoe looked around her body now not aware of her missing second head. &quot;Did you make my ass bigger? It better not be my ass, I hate finding new pants!&quot; Zoe continued trying to find the change, completely oblivious to the loss of her head.<br />
<br />
Calvin looked back at his captor and was taken aback by the simple change as well as the reaction from Zoe in his once mothers body.<br />
<br />
Sally clocked the recognition in Calvin&#39;s expression and body language. Quickly Sally began questioning reality, more questions coming to mind and the remote holding the answer. Calvin finally looked back at his real mother in his girlfriend&#39;s warped body watching the emotional journey that ran across her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...&quot; She whispered at Calvin. Calvin knew immediately the jig was up. &quot;You little...&quot; She continued. &quot;Now Sally I know...&quot; Calvin stammered trying to jump ahead of the conversation.<br />
&quot;Oh I figured that out!&quot; Sally roared with Zoe&#39;s voice, a rather terrifying sound for Calvin. &quot;How could you toy with your own daughter&#39;s bodies like this?&quot; She paused looking back at the remote, noticing the role swap functions. &quot;Oh my god! Are you even my mother?&quot; <br />
<br />
Calvin tripped over his own words, half trying to find a starting point but Sally was having none of it. She pointed the remote at him and his mouth vanished. He prodded the smooth gap under his nose to try and speak but only muffled cries came out. &quot;Do you have any idea what its like to have a dick so big you&#39;ll never be able to use it?&quot; Sally began &quot; or be stuck to one room in the house and used like an object to be eaten off of? How about tits so cold your nipples are always so erect you could cut glass! Every second of every day? Not to mention the messes all this ice cream makes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally finally relented, catching her breath and composing herself. &quot;You&#39;ve no idea how troublesome this body is. But you will...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, Sally?&quot; Zoe questioned, what are you going on about?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sally didn&#39;t respond she only fiddled with the remote and pointed it at Calvin. <br />
<br />
Instantly his cock inflated like a blimp! Reaching the same proportions as Sally&#39;s its tip banging painfully against the wall and ceiling before flopping on top of Sally&#39;s now identical cock table. His balls also swelled and he felt his legs rise as his hips flared out painfully from the enormous girth of his unmovable prick!<br />
<br />
Next his shirt burst open as his pecs suddenly swelled with fat, he gave out a muffled painful moan from his sealed throat as the budding flesh became round and a light blue hue to them. It was quickly becoming clear as his newfound breasts reached G cup proportions that Sally had given him ice cream breasts like hers. His stiff nipples arching up as they became rock hard and oozing soft serve like a spout. <br />
<br />
Calvin reached forward rubbing the new mounds vigorously trying to keep them warm and sooth the stimulated nipples. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t!&quot; Sally remarked firing the remote again. In a flash Calvin&#39;s outstretched arms vanished, the tattered remains of his shit draped over his shoulders like a robe. The once normal boy was reduced to a near sobbing mess his body dominated by a massive useless cock and cold stimulated breasts. Arm-less and mouth-less, his legs too far stretched to even waddle, Calvin now found himself at the mercy of Sally. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sally! Babe! What&#39;s going on? Stop yelling at mom! You know she can&#39;t do anything!&quot; Zoe protested in defense of her perceived mother Calvin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Zoe think about this. If this remote were real, which it is, it would explain why the three of us are the only people in the world with weird bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoe seemed to question this for a moment. &quot;Sally we&#39;ve always been this way! That&#39;s just some silly scam thing you fell for and are trying to prank me, at moms expense to! Your being a bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally struggled for a moment trying to understand why she wasn&#39;t getting through to her like she had herself. <br />
<br />
Taking a drastic measure Sally punched in a command and presented the remote Zoe. &quot;Fine, if its fake then press this button here with the remote pointed at me and my prank will be finished.&quot; She said with a snarl<br />
<br />
Zoe put out her gargantuan hands index finger for Sally to set the remote on. Sally obliged making sure the remote was pointed at her. &quot;Gladly!&quot; Zoe said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
Her other hand&#39;s index finger gently glided over the remote, using the manicured nail corner to press down on the grain-of-sand sized button.<br />
<br />
Instantly Zoe was looking down a massive cock and freezing cold boobs. Her own MILF body and mattress sized hands standing before her with the remote and wearing an irritated expression. Sally had pre-programmed the remote to mind swap them back to their original bodies (not that either of them knew which was who&#39;s)<br />
<br />
Using the remote seemed to have broken the obscured reasoning induced by its effects as Sally watched herself&#39;s expression go though a thought journey of emotion like she had moments ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll?&quot; Sally asked in her original voice (unknowingly) <br />
<br />
Zoe turned her expression to Calvin who looked destructed by his own problems. &quot;You giant prick!&quot; She screamed at him, catching his attention. Looking at the twos death glares Calvin was receiving he realized both women had figured him out and now had the remote at their disposal...</p>
