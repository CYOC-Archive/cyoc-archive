I&#39;m always looking for feedback :) </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was dark when I woke up and it took me a moment to realize why: Apparently, I had snuggled up into Bruce&#39;s mighty armpit during the night, and it was now covering my eyes and nose. I could hear him snoring slightly and feel his chest rising and falling gently as he breathed.<br />
My immediate environment, his armpit, was damp from his sweat and smelling ripe and manly. I took in a deep breath of that smell and let it overpower me for a moment. I really liked the way Bruce smelled, and the thought that he would go back to shower every day in one and a half week made me a bit sad. On the other hand, that seemed so distant, so impossible even, to go back to that other life, that I cut off the train of thought right there. I took another breath and wondered if the smell would be even more intense, when I tasted it.<br />
I carefully extended my tongue to lick his hairy pit gently, just with the tip of my tongue. It tasted salty and like an essence of that smell. I licked again, with a broader swipe of my tongue now.<br />
That was a bit too much, as I felt his chest rise in a sigh that signaled me, Bruce was waking up. When he lifted his arm, I was exposed to &quot;fresher&quot; air of the tent.<br />
&quot;Good morning, Ryan&quot;, Bruce yawned in his deep and rumbling voice.<br />
&quot;Good morning&quot;, I croaked back. My throat was pretty dry, so I sounded sorry in comparison.<br />
Bruce sat up and gathered his senses for a bit, before he began to crawl out of the tent. It was really not easy for a man of his size to squeeze through the entrance, and he had to squirm with his broad shoulders until he got them out successfully.<br />
&quot;Are you coming?&quot; I heard his voice from outside and quickly exited the tent. He was taking me with him to his morning business, like he never did anything else in his life. I trotted behind him towards the bushes, admiring his muscular backside and firm ass that was clearly visible through his sweatpants. <br />
As he arrived, he took out his dick - I swear, it was even bigger than before - and relaxed, sending the first trickle of liquid into the leaves.<br />
Acting on a spontaneuos impulse, I dove down into the foliage, shoving my face right into his stream. Bruce stood there, with his legs apart and one hand on his dick, aiming his stream into the wild in one moment, and onto my face in the next. <br />
The pressure of his piss hit me with force, and splashed from my face all over my t-shirt and pants, quickly soaking them. The surroundings were also still wet, not damp, from his previous sessions, so Bruces piss surrounded me from all sides. But that was not enough for me, I wanted more.<br />
I opened my mouth wide, trying to catch as much of the waste liquid as possible. Bruce helped by aiming at my very widely open mouth. The yellow morning piss quickly filled my mouth and got on my tongue. Yesterday, I wondered if all piss tastes the same; definitly not. Bruce&#39;s piss was something entirely different. It was like nectar to me, like I never wanted to drink anything else again in my life. Greedily, I gulped it down as fast as I could, but I was no match for Bruce&#39;s bladder capacity and he was not holding back one bit. I spilled what felt like galleons down my chin and onto my body, showering me in his pee. Like on its own, my dick began to release my  own piss, only trickling because of how hard I was. It mixed with Bruce&#39;s and added to completely soaking my clothing.<br />
Bruce moved closer now, and shoved his dick into my mouth, sending his stream directly down my throat, without the need for me to swallow. I imagined my belly inflating from the sheer amount of liquid that was being pumped into it. <br />
I could feel his cock growing in my mouth, stiffening, as he grew an erection, at the same time, his stream was subsiding. I started sucking, partly because I did not want the flow to end, partly because I wanted to please Bruce. <br />
Now, being straight, I have never given a blowjob in my life, but apparently, I was doing rather well. After a short time, Bruce&#39;s cock was entirely solid and when I looked up, I saw his magnificient torso, his muscular chest and his manly face, with his 10 centimeter horns sticking out on top. He was moaning, shoving his rod in and out of my mouth, while I sucked and stimulated him with my tongue. When I started to gag because he overdid it, he immediately slowed down was more careful. My hands found his balls, massaging both them and the sensitive part between his sack and asshole. <br />
He didn&#39;t last long like that. With a loud cry that caused numerous birds to fly up, his balls contracted under my hand and he came right into my mouth. The sheer amount of cum was overwhelming. I didn&#39;t really have the choice to spit or to swallow, as my mouth quickly filled with the hot, delicious creamy liquid, forcing me to swallow it down quickly, before the next spurt erupted into my mouth. It came out of my nose and run over my chin, dripping on my chest. Bruce was panting hard, but still stood strong and manly. He lifted me up, and pressed his mouth onto mine, drawing me into a kiss.<br />
Bruce didn&#39;t care that I must have tasted like piss and cum, but he just kissed me, hard. I was melting. Of course, I had kissed my fair share of girls, but nothing even came close to this. His tongue that invaded my mouth was not delicate or small, but a strong, manly tongue, suprisingly broad and long even. My heart was pounding like I was a little schoolgirl and any resistance melted in me. I did not care anymore that this was the very definition of &quot;gay&quot;; I had absolutely fallen in love with Bruce.<br />
My dick twitched in my wet pants. With a muffled moan, still kissing Bruce, I came into my pants, without even touching myself. I had never experienced anything remotely as erotic as this very moment and I didn&#39;t ever want it to end.<br />
Of course it ended, though, when Bruce carefully let go of me, leaving me standing there dazed. I actually was too disoriented to decide how to proceed. Thankfully, Bruce seemed to have noticed and took my hand, leading me back to the campsite, where he put me in my camping chair. <br />
The bright sunlight beaming down had already began drying me up. If I thought of me smelling like a public restroom yesterday, the fumes raising up from me could only be described as the smell of that one really raunchy urinal that has not been cleaned for ages. That didn&#39;t bother me, though, quite the opposite:<br />
Being marked that way by Bruce signified a connection to him that made me feel butterflies in my chest again. Every pore of me smelled like him, it was like I was owned by him, his property. I liked that thought a lot, somehow.<br />
Besides, the association with a raunchy urinal was not entirely wrong either. I was certainly raunchy at the moment and well, I was drinking piss. That&#39;s more or less the definition of a urinal. That too felt not wrong, but good instead. It was difficult to describe, but I had the impression that being an uncleaned urinal was what I was supposed to be, the now newly discovered core of my being. I didn&#39;t see this as degrading one bit, more fulfilling.<br />
I decided to tell Bruce that I wanted to service him more in that regard.<br />
&quot;You know, Bruce, what we did just do in the bushes... I think I want to do that more often.&quot;<br />
Bruce looked up at me: &quot;Huh?&quot;, he made, not sounding overly clever in the process.<br />
&quot;Eh you know. Drinking your piss.&quot; I gulped, and added: &quot;Being your urinal&quot;. It was somehow harder to say than to think.<br />
&quot;Of course, what else would you be?&quot; he asked, sounding gentle and unsuprised. Another fact that came most naturally to him.<br />
<br />
We talked a bit more over the next hours, over different things, and our feelings. I did notice his sentences had gotten shorter, his choice of words a bit simpler. He was not talking like the intellectual he used to be. That did seem right though, and fitted his new body much better, if you ask me. It even made him a bit more attractive to me, if that was even possible.<br />
Another thing I noticed was, how Bruce was increasingly squirming in his seat during the day, often readjusting his sweatpants or shoes.<br />
It was early afternoon, when I asked him about it.<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure, it&#39;s just so...&quot;, he tugged at his sweatpants, &quot;uncomfortable&quot;.<br />
Indeed, he was filling out the roomy sweatpants pretty well now. I could see his muscular calves bulging under them, and of course, his loose dick that was clearly outlined down the left leg. Even his balls had grown to a size that I could make them out without much need for imagination. It did look like someone had stuffed two apples down his pants.<br />
&quot;You know, you could probably just take them off. I wouldn&#39;t mind.&quot; God, I really would not.<br />
Bruce looked like I had just invented a machine that could end world hunger. &quot;That&#39;s a very good idea&quot;, he blurted out, and, without hesitation, began to undo his shoes and socks before peeling himself out of his pants. I heard the snap of the rubber band, as he was seriously overextending its capacity, but the pants came down quickly, leaving Bruce totally nude. He obviously did not treat all of his property with the same care as me. <br />
&quot;That&#39;s so much better!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;m never gonna wear any of that shit again!&quot;<br />
Bruce seemed really happy, and I was happy, too. Not only had I been able to help Bruce in his predicament, I could also stare at his bare body all the time now.<br />
And there was a lot to stare. Bruce was really hairy, so much I had trouble seeing his skin at some points of his body. His frame was bulky from mostly muscle mass, but also some layer of fat here and there, giving him a very solid impression over all. Then of course, there was his groin, which was a story of its own: A heavy member, dangling from a plump ballsack, filled with testes the size of small apples.<br />
I subconsciously licked my lips from the sight.<br />
&quot;Ah, you know, I&#39;m gonna go for a run now and take a huge dump after that&quot; He grinned. Yep, definitely a lot simpler than before. I briefly wondered, if I should care for his dump too, but decided that this was not my task. Perhaps in an emergency, he might stuff that into my face... No, this was not an emergency.<br />
I just nodded and watched him run off, with his package swinging freely like a pendulum. I tried to jack off while he was gone, but found it just not the same when Bruce was not around. I could get hard no problem (in fact I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been so constantly aroused since I was a teen), but no matter how much I pumped, I wouldn&#39;t cum. That changed immediately, when Bruce suprised me by coming back. As soon as I heard his voice greet me - not reacting to the fact I was beating my meat furiously - I came in a few arcs of white spunk hitting my chest and belly.<br />
Bruce grinned broadly, as he proudly claimed: &quot;I just dropped off a massive dump!&quot; in a tone he used to use when he solved some difficult accounting problem. I didn&#39;t really know how to react, so I just said: Okay, great - I guess. So what now? &quot;<br />
&quot;Now I need to piss.&quot; he said and stepped closer.<br />
I understood. That&#39;s where I, his &#39;urinal&#39; came in. Despite the fact that I literally just climaxed, I already found myself aroused again, as I opened my mouth wide.<br />
I got to my knees and Bruce stepped closer, but this time, he didn&#39;t seem to intend to insert his dick into my mouth, but instead started aiming at my open hole and pissed from half a meter away.<br />
It proved ineffective at first, and more missed the rather small opening in my face than hit it. Determined to not let so much of that delicious piss go to waste, I tried to open wider and wider, to make it easier for Bruce to aim. Funnily enough, that seemed to work rather well. Every time I thought my mouth was as open as I could probably open it, I managed to get out another centimeter or two. Apparently it was wide enough after a while to enable Bruce to aim his stream safely into it. However, there was still the issue of swallowing. Every few seconds, I had to swallow, leading to more liquid spilling in the meantime. I tried to tilt my head back a bit and just let it flow through directly into my stomach. It took a few attempts, but I also managed to do just this, drinking down Bruce&#39;s piss now without interruption.<br />
When he was finally done, he just patted me on the head and said &quot;Thanks, urinal&quot; like that was my name. I was just about to reply how I liked it to be called that by him, when I found I couldn&#39;t. Where opening up my mouth incredibly wide had been surprisingly easy, closing it was surprisingly hard. To be exact, I found I could not move a single limb, but remained in the exact same position I was when Bruce used me.<br />
This was another case where I probably should have panicked, but was remaining awfully calm. I just watched Bruce turn around and walk back to his chair, letting himself slump into it.<br />
This time, the chair did not hold. With the sound of aluminum bending, it collapsed under his weight and send him to the ground. My heart skipped a beat. I just hoped that Bruce had not hurt himself. Apparently he had not, though, because he just snorted, kicked the remains of the chair out of the way and lied down on his stomach, catching some sun on his backside. <br />
I had a good view of his back, while I was kneeling there immobile with my mouth open. <br />
His horns had grown to at least 15 to 20 centimeters now, thick at the base and arched slightly as they extended up. The entire backside including his muscular legs and his firm ass were covered by his body hair, which had a brown color and was so dense in some places, that I could not see the skin beneath. Where I could see skin, it had tanned a fair bit, reducing the contrast to his hair further.<br />
There was something new as well. Right above his ass, on his tailbone, there was a small nub standing out, with a tuft of hair on it. It was only a few centimeters long, but when he moved his right arm to scratch his ass, it twitched on his own, so it was probably muscled.<br />
Slowly, I could feel movement returning to my limbs over the course of an hour or two. Before I could finally close my mouth again, some flies had flown into and out of it again, which produced an unpleasant tickling feeling on my tongue. That was the downside to the great outside - or being immobile.<br />
The next hours went on without much happening. Over dinner and after that, Bruce and I were talking again, about various topics. He did keep calling me &quot;Urinal&quot;, which seemed odd at first. I had the feeling that I had another name, which was of course nonsense, the longer I thought about it. Why should I, Urinal, have another name? That was just what I was, so that was what I was called, simple as that. The peaceful environment made me think about funny things for sure. <br />
I didn&#39;t have much appetite again during dinner, as opposed to Bruce, who wolfed down my portion as well. I did make sure to drink a lot though, as I was perpetually a bit thirsty. Not bad thirsty, but always ready for more liquid.<br />
Finally, it was time to sleep. As before, I cuddled up to Bruce and he laid his arm around me.<br />
While I was already feeling safe and ready to doze off, I felt his member, now uncontained by some piece of clothing, stiffen up against my sweatpants clad ass.<br />
&quot;Urinal?&quot;, Bruce whispered, &quot;are you already asleep? I&#39;m not so tired yet.&quot;<br />
His low rumbling voice was not really made for whispering and even if I had been asleep, he would probably have woken me up again, but I was actually wide awake now. Instead of an answer, I snuggled my backside up more against his growing erection which caused him to produce a low moan.<br />
&quot;Do you want to try it out&quot;, he &#39;whispered&#39; again and, as I nodded, added &#39;I&#39;ll be gentle. &quot;<br />
He turned me around first and drew me into another wet and sloppy kiss. I could not see it, but I could feel that his nose seemed somehow broader and flatter, and that his tongue had become even bigger.<br />
Meanwhile his big brutish hands slid down to my soiled sweatpants and underwear, and he slid them off, releasing a stinking cloud from my ripe groin in the process.<br />
He tried my t-shirt next, but failed to pull it over my head, because we were still locked in the kiss (he really wasn&#39;t very clever).<br />
I grabbed his hands with mine and guided them in a ripping motion. That he understood. The sound of him destroying my shirt like it was made out of thin paper made my dick twitch and reminded me of his immense strength. <br />
I was naked now, like Bruce, and our bodies - mine normal sized and his massive like a bull - rubbed together. Our very erect cocks where sandwiched between us, and the feeling of his massive tool on my medium sized one sent shivers down my spine.<br />
Finally, he broke the kiss and turned me around, his cock now lined up to my ass. With carefully controlled strength and greed, he tried to enter my virgin asshole, but regardless of how much I tried to relax, it wouldn&#39;t work: His tool was just too big in comparison.<br />
I heard him grunt in frustration. I had no experience in anal sex but I remembered one thing:<br />
&quot;We need some lube! Maybe spit on...&quot; I didn&#39;t need to finish my sentence. <br />
Of course, Bruce did not spit on his dick, but instead released some of his hot bladder contents on and into my hole. That made sense of course, I was his urinal after all. It did prove effective anyways, as with the added lubrication, he managed to penetrate my ass.<br />
If I had had any idea that being fucked felt so good, I might have questioned my heterosexuality much sooner. It hurt a bit, but that was nothing compared to the exciting feeling of his dick in me, stimulating my prostrate in ways I had never imagined.<br />
&quot;Oh yes! Bruce!&quot; I exclaimed, and shoved my ass further up his rod until my cheeks hit his loins and our balls collided.<br />
Bruce was obviously enjoying it. The sounds he made when he carefully started pumping his tool back and forth didn&#39;t even sound human, more like a low mooing.<br />
I grabbed my own cock with my right hand and tried to match his slowly increasing rhythm of him pounding into you.<br />
&quot;Oh God, Bruce&quot;, I couldn&#39;t help myself, I was moaning and yelling his name. If there had been any other visitors at the campsite, everyone would know what we were doing right now.<br />
The ride continued for some time, not nearly enough, when I felt his pounding getting more intense once more and his mooing noises getting louder.<br />
&quot;Oh yes! B-bull!&quot; I cried as I climaxed. At the same time, Bull cried out in a bellowing voice and I could feel his balls contact, shortly before he pumped his seed into me, probably painting my insides white.<br />
We both collapsed right after, totally spent. I could only cuddle against the warm body of Bull and drifted to sleep without him even pulling out of me.</p>
