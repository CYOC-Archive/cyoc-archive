<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harold sat in the darkness of his home as he thought about his situation.  He had no idea what time it was as the grandfather clock he brought in from Michigan wasn&#39;t set yet, and he didn&#39;t have a watch or a clock nearby.  Instead, he sat in the shadows of his room mourning, or rather, re-mourning the loss of his wife.  He had in his lap a picture book that he had of him and his wife.  He looked through the pictures that he took during their time together.  He smiled as looked at the picture of him proposing to her as she accepted.  This was followed by pictures of their dates together, their wedding pictures, including the traditional stuff each other with cakes picture.  He smiled as he looked through and remembered the time that Melissa was born, of her growing up learning how to talk and walk, and of the many many family trips they took together.  Honestly, those were the best times of his life.  He turned the page and happiness turned to sadness as he saw the last family portrait they took together.  It was after his wife was diagnosed with cancer, but before she was hospitalized.  The next few pictures were of her in the hospital.  His eyes swelled with tears as he saw the last picture of her alive.  Her head was bald, her skin was pale, and her face was placid.  Yet, despite what she was going through, she still had a bright smile on her face.  She&#39;d always been cheerful to the last.  He turned the page and tears started to fall from his eyes as he saw the last photo.  It was the last picture he took right before he and Melissa left Michigan to go to Moon Lake.  While they were in Michigan, Harold took the time to make frequent trips to his wife&#39;s grave.  Since he was moving far far away, he knew that he couldn&#39;t visit her anymore.  So, he took one last photo so that at the very least, he could visit her in spirit.  His fingers shakingly glossed over the pictures as tears fell from his face and on to the book.  His thoughts were interrupted when he heard the doorbell ring.<br />
<br />
He sighed as he closed the book and wiped the tears from his face.  He quickly got up from the couch and marched to the door, a scowl on his face that masked his sadness.  He flung open the door and yelled out, &quot;Ms. Decrux, I thought I told you...&quot;  He stopped midsentence as he realized who was at the door.  His expression changed as he opened eyes wide and grimaced a little.  He then said, &quot;Dean...Dean Myers, I&#39;m so sorry about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean gave a gentle smile and said, &quot;Quite all right, Harold.  I just came to check on you and see how you were doing.  Is everything all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold sighed and said, &quot;Sorry, it&#39;s just been a busy day.  Movers finally came and we got all of our stuff from Michigan in the house.  Just busy trying to get everything sorted out.  Would you like to come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean smiled as he said, &quot;Certainly.&quot;  Harold motioned for Dean to come in, and after noticing how dark it was, turned on all the lights.  Dean looked around and noticed all of the empty and yet unpacked boxes strewn about everywhere.  He also noticed the redness in Harold&#39;s eyes, but chose to not say anything at this time.  Harold motioned to the living room, and towards the couch, which the Dean took as an invitation to sit down.  Harold sat in a recliner that was nearby.  &quot;So, how are things so far?  Last we talked, you were still learning about the town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and so far, I think I have a bit of an understanding of what this town is and why it is the way it is.  Can&#39;t say I particularly like the laws here, but I can see why they&#39;re there.&quot;  As Harold said this, his mouth moved off to the side of his mouth as he sighed a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; Dean replied.  &quot;So, I take it that you have plans then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not me in particular,&quot; Harold said, &quot;but my daughter Melissa came to me last night and said that she&#39;d be willing to be the family were.  I&#39;m not happy about it, but at least she chose to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good, then,&quot; Dean said, looking visibly relieved.  &quot;Has she joined a group yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold shook his head and said, &quot;Not yet.  Last I talked with her, she&#39;s still trying to decide.  Although, I did have some requirements, such as letting me know and waiting a day.  I hope she at least keeps to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Dean said as he nodded and then asked, &quot;And have you experienced any other trouble?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Harold answered as he thought through his answer.  &quot;Although, I keep getting visited be a couple of ladies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Dean said as his right eyebrow went up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, one Virginia McCoy and one Alice Decrux,&quot; Harold responded.<br />
<br />
Dean took a minute to think, and then said, &quot;Virginia I know.  If I remember right, she&#39;s a teacher at the local high school.  History I think.  And she&#39;s still single too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold could have sworn his heart skipped a beat when he heard that but then he asked, &quot;And how do you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Dean said as he smiled, &quot;She&#39;s a part of my pride.  Nice woman, joined ten years ago I think.  If you want, I could introduce her to you.<br />
<br />
Harold chuckled a little and then said, &quot;We&#39;ve met already.  Now, the other one is Alice Decrux.  Don&#39;t know anything about her, but she&#39;s been rather persistent as of late.&quot;<br />
<br />
The smile faded from Dean&#39;s mouth as he leaned back and thought seriously for a moment.  &quot;Alice...Alice Decrux...the name sounds familiar, but I can&#39;t put my claw on it.  It&#39;s just...I&#39;d be careful around her.  I think I remember something about her, something bad, but I just can&#39;t get it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold&#39;s mouth pursed a little as he said, &quot;I see.  I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Dean continued, &quot;I know you&#39;re busy getting things set up and all, but when will you be back into work.  We&#39;ll need the syllabi for the classes that you&#39;ll be teaching next semester soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; Harold said as he remembered that he was still employed.  &quot;Well, I remember the warning you gave me about staying low for this week, and with everything that&#39;s been going on, I figured that I&#39;d be busy with this week.  I&#39;ll be back in on Monday and I&#39;ll start working on my classes then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean nodded as he said, &quot;That&#39;s fine.  Come in when you can.  And I&#39;ll look into this Alice girl for you.  There&#39;s just something I don&#39;t like about her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold smiled and said, &quot;I appreciate that.&quot;  With that said, he got up and said, &quot;Well, if you don&#39;t mind, I still have work that I need to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood,&quot; Dean said as he got up from the couch.  He held out his hand, which Harold took and shook it.  Harold lead Dean to the door.  Before Dean left, he said, &quot;Thanks for hanging in there, and stay safe.&quot;  Harold smiled and nodded.<br />
<br />
Once Dean left and Harold closed the door, he turned to the mess that was before him.  Before Dean&#39;s visit, Harold was in a funk about his deceased wife.  But now that distraction&#39;s over with, he could focus on the task at hand.  After taking a moment to check on the time, he noticed that it was getting late into the afternoon.  He was starting to wonder where Melissa was.</p>
