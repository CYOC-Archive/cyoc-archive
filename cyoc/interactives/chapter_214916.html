<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There where now eight mermaids and mermans sitting on the beach, of the eight of them seven of them where in a state of totally shock because only a few minutes ago the seven of them had been humans who hadn’t believed merpeople where real outside of movies/books.<br />
 <br />
“WHAT THE FUCK!!!!” yelled Lily as she freaked out about now she had a tail instead of a pair of legs.<br />
<br />
Everyone else was freaking out in their own way, Chloe was in a state of shock but instead of focusing on her own changes she was looking at everyone else. Her sister-in-law Lily was freaking out and cursing, her girlfriend Zoey was just sitting there wide eyed looking at her tail and touching it before moving it slightly. Chloe’s 8 year old son, was pressing his face into her side, not looking at anything. Her husband had his arms wrapped around her and their son protecting them. Her mother-in-law was yelling at her husband to get him to pull his now merman body toward them in order to be with his family.<br />
<br />
Then before any of them could get past the first stages of reacting to what had happened to them all of them where suddenly surrounded by purple energy. They where lifted off the sand, their tails falling down so that they brushed the sand, that is when they all realized how much longer their tails where compared to their legs. For a second Chloe guessed that she had added at least a foot if not two feet in length.<br />
 <br />
Then they where pulled out to sea, the wind blowing in their face hard enough to force them to close their eyes as most screamed.<br />
<br />
“MAKE IT STOP!” yelled Nathan as Chloe placed her head into her son’s hair pulling him closer, looking back she found that she had even shielded the baby she had only meet moments ago and who seamed to have caused all of this as much as she shielded her own son.<br />
<br />
Finally they where pulled into the water, the water should have been cool to cold but it felt pretty good and as they where pulled down. They all noticed that they didn’t have to close their eyes instead they could open them and see better then they could even have seen on land. The water was still there but it didn’t seam dense to them, instead it felt more like air.<br />
<br />
Finally, they came to a stop, and they weren’t alone. <br />
<br />
Before them or rather around them was almost twenty mermaids and merman, they all had the same general tail shape with the mermaids having only 1 fin at the end of their tails and membrane around their hips while the merman had Y shape tails with smaller fins across their tails. They came in all different colors and color combination. Some of them had very unnatural hair color, like Lime green and one had a rainbow color hair while others had what would be considered normal hair. Some had normal human like ears, some the short pointy ears and some extremely long pointed ears, that trait seamed to cross all genders and wasn’t limited to one. All of them where handsome and beautiful in their own way, the heaviest one looked a kin to one of those pacific island warriors and even had a face tattoo to match. <br />
<br />
All but one of them wore what looked to be a cross of medieval armor and police riot gear, metal breast plate with what looked to be a long sleeve chainmail shirt, however they all had gloves on and what looked to be a police like tactical vest over the breast plate. <br />
<br />
All of them had swords, spears or what looked to be a type of spear gun. <br />
<br />
All of them but one.<br />
<br />
She was in the middle, she was breathtaking beauty, with long black hair which fell down in curls that a Hollywood actress would kill to have naturally. Her long neck was elegant, and her skin was perfect. <br />
<br />
Unlike the others, she didn’t wear the armor of the others, instead she wore what looked to be a bronze bra made out of scales. A similar scale skirt surrounded her hips, but the armor looked more ceremonial in natural then practical.<br />
<br />
The thing that stood out was that down her arms and running around her collar bones before meeting below her throat was a series of tattoos which where still glowing in the same color as the energy which had taken them here.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck.” Said Molly “My God…I am breathing sea water.”<br />
<br />
They all where, they were breathing sea water…they were breathing underwater.<br />
<br />
“Who are you!” yelled her father-in-law as now freed from having to drag himself across the sand he was able to come to his family side. <br />
<br />
All of them where now moving closer together, with Chloe or rather Nathan in the center all of them wanting to protect him and unknow as well the baby.<br />
<br />
The mermaid said something to the older merman with a face tattoo in a language none of them knew before she extended her hand and began a short of can’t as the tattoos began to glow again and energy began to gather in a ball in her hand. <br />
<br />
What spell is the Mermaid mage casting</p>
