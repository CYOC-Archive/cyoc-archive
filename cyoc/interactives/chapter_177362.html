<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex woke when sunlight started streaming through the window. First thing he noticed was the warmth against his back. Evin hadn&#39;t snuck back to his room once Alex fell asleep but rather had stayed with him all night. One burly arm was wrapped around him, holding him close against the bull&#39;s chest. It was warm and safe and..<br />
<br />
And it had Alex laying there with his donkey cock at full mast. He hadn&#39;t really looked at it yesterday, but the thing was obscene, easily a foot long and thick as his wrist. The inhuman shape of it would also take some getting used to. As he shifted slightly, he felt something else rock hard pressed up against his back and resting between his ass cheeks. Was it just morning wood or was Evin enjoying this cuddle as much as he seemed to be.<br />
<br />
Alex shifted slightly, rubbing himself up against that rigid shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.. you&#39;re up.&quot; Came Evin&#39;s gruff voice from behind him. He felt a nose press up against the back of his neck, ruffling his bristly mane.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you.&quot; Alex said with another shift against Evin&#39;s cock. He felt a large hand come to rest on his own cock, giving it a long slow stroke. This world must be getting to him to just think of having his way with Evin. He barely knew the bull, and here he was naked in bed with him. But wasn&#39;t that how this world was? He could feel that his hole was already slick and ready. Something else he was getting surprisingly used to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure..&quot; Evin seemed to be reading Alex&#39;s thoughts.<br />
<br />
In answer Alex lifted one of his legs, reached behind him, and guided Evin&#39;s cocktip to his hole. He had to shift his hips, as Evin wasn&#39;t small, though Alex did seem to be the bigger between them. Evin didn&#39;t need much more of an invitation and slowly thrust inside of Alex. The bull snorted his pleasure against the back of Alex&#39;s neck. Despite the bull&#39;s size, Alex found himself taking it easily, moaning softly as he bulls hips pressed up against his rear.<br />
<br />
Evin began to thrust in earnest, his hips rolling in a fluid motion as he slid in and out of Alex, his hand moving in time along the donkey&#39;s thick shaft. Alex let out a little braying wicker as he felt that cock rutting inside of him, his eyes sliding shut as he let the bull have his way with him. Alex had already cum once through this half-donkey cock, but that was some weird side effect of a spell, this was.. different. And felt so much better as he felt his two heavy balls churning. He clenches around Evin&#39;s cock as he felt his own climax wrack through his body, his nerves jolting with electricity for a moment, especially where he touched the bull. A moment later he felt warmth flowing through his gut and felt as well as heard Evin let out a low, heavy moan.<br />
<br />
Even though they were already laying down, the two seemed to collapse against each other in the bed, panting heavily. Alex pulled himself off the bull once he felt Evin soften enough and sat up, then Evin sat up next to him. They locked muzzles, which was a new and ineresting experience for Alex, one he found he was quite enjoying as he felt the bull&#39;s tongue pressed against his own.<br />
<br />
After a moment Evin stood and got a rag from the closet, using it to clean up the rather substantial mess Alex left on the floor over the side of the bed. He felt his ears heat up. &quot;Sorry, I should..&quot; He reached out to take the rag, causing the bull to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I made you make the mess, I clean it up.&quot; He leaned forward and pressed his nose against Alex&#39;s, which had a similar feel to a peck on the cheek, before he stood up. &quot;C&#39;mon, it smells like Geff has breakfast ready.&quot; Alex sniffed at the air, surprised he could pick out the smell of stewing fruits and sweet honey. Evin didn&#39;t even go to get dressed before heading downstairs, and Alex didn&#39;t have anything to wear so he just followed.<br />
<br />
Geff smiled almost knowingly as his brother and Alex appeared. Unlike the two of them the fox had on some trousers, and was setting out bowls of oatmeal with that sweet fruit mixture Alex had been smelling. Sitting next to his bowl though was a small ball of very familiar looking green paste. He blushed a little when he saw it, popping it in his mouth and trying not to make a face and the astringent taste. Geff just looked pleased. &quot;I don&#39;t need any little bull calves to look after just yet.&quot; Evin didn&#39;t even look embarrassed, even if Alex felt his ears heating up again.<br />
<br />
While Alex and Geff ate slowly, Evin began to scarf down his meal, making excuses about running late to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Alex said, his ears drooping a little. &quot;I kept you too long, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evin set down his empty bowl and stood up. Walking over to Alex, he did another one of those nose to nose taps. &quot;Don&#39;t apologize, I wanted to stay with you. And I think we both needed that.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned to clomp upstairs, no doubt to get dressed for his job as Alex fell silent and turned back to eating his food. Geff was smiling like he was proud of what was going on, which only weirded Alex out a little. &quot;I guess you&#39;ll be helping me with a few things today?&quot; The fox said in a cheery tone, his ears wiggling slightly in excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, yes, I owe you for everything you&#39;ve done.&quot; Alex said between spoonfuls of food and a nod to the fox.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, consider us even. I haven&#39;t seen my brother in this good a mood for months. I feel like I should be bribing you to stay.&quot; Though Geff went quiet as Evin clomped down the stairs dressed in his guard armor, waved to the two other men, and bolted out the door. The fox laughed. &quot;Anyway, eat up, we have a shopping list and I want to get to the market before all the good stuff is picked over. Oh!&quot;<br />
<br />
The fox hopped to his feet and grabbed something made of cloth from where it was draped over one of the chairs and held it out to Alex. He took it and unfolded it, looking the pair of linen trousers up and down, he actually felt like tearing up but held back. &quot;Thanks. Sorry.. it&#39;s been a rough few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to share your story, but first, eat up.&quot;</p>
