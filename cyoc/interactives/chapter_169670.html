<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec stood there waiting, the pressure in his udders felt overwhelming. He really needed to be milked. &quot;Umm, when are we changing back?&quot; A different sensation also crept in, he felt a heat build up in his hindquarters.<br />
Vivian looked at him. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I know my curse is lifted, because I can think clearly again. I have no idea about the body you currently have. Maybe it&#39;s...&quot;<br />
&quot;Vivian!&quot; An unknown voice called.<br />
Both looked at the direction of sound. A naked woman came walking unto the field. Her skin was grey and had an odd slimy sheen. Her well defined muscles made it clear she was an adventurer as well. Honestly, if she hadn&#39;t been naked he might have confused her with a guy. <br />
Somehow, the way she walked made Alec think of a stern teacher he used to have. Her short pixie cut clung to her slimy skin. <br />
While she had legs, her arms were short and stubby.<br />
&quot;Andrea!&quot; Vivian waved.<br />
<br />
The woman called Andrea approached them, eyes focused on Vivian. &quot;I see my ward worked. You did it, you saved us. You look terrible though.&quot;<br />
&quot;I feel like shit, think you can do something about it?&quot;<br />
Andrea looked at her stubby arms with tiny hands at the end. &quot;I will try, but you may have to wait a little before my arms morph back for a proper heal.&quot;<br />
Her stumpy arms wriggled around. &quot;Heal.&quot;<br />
A green light sparked around her stubby arms and fluttered weakly to Vivian. The light enveloped her briefly before subsiding.<br />
She touched her leg. &quot;Well, better than nothing. Thanks.&quot;<br />
Alec felt like a little kid while two mothers kept yapping among themselves, but he really needed to go. More than going, the heat in his groin was radiating outward. He found his mind briefly wondering to a big fat bull cock before forcing his mind back to here and now. <br />
&quot;Sorry. I can&#39;t do more yet. My mana is restored, but with my arms like this I can&#39;t properly weave my magic. So take it easy with that leg, or it might open again.&quot; She surveyed the area.  &quot;You really had quite a party here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not my doing, that&#39;s all on Alec. He did most of the work.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alec?&quot; Andrea looked around with a confused expression before settling her eyes on the odd cow creature next to her.<br />
She looked back at Vivian, obviously expecting some sort of explanation or her usual joke face.<br />
Alec had no idea what to say in a situation like this. He felt lame, one of these days he was going to have a cool body and use a cool one liner when meeting someone. Today was not that day.<br />
&quot;Hi. Err, Pleased to meet you?&quot; He slurred through his thick tongue. No, today he was horny fat cow Alec who timidly responded with slurred speech. <br />
&quot;Fascinating.&quot; Andrea crouched, her brown eyes met Alec&#39;s eyes. &quot;Are you telling me this pitiful looking creature here helped?&quot;<br />
&quot;Who are you calling pitiful?&quot; Alec protested, though he realized the folly of his protests in his current form. Damn, he needed to be milked and maybe a good fuck while they were at it.<br />
&quot;Yes, well not necessarily that creature, but what&#39;s inside it.&quot; Vivian shrugged.<br />
&quot;Milk?&quot;<br />
Vivian snickered while Alec rolled his eyes. &quot;No, Alec. Short version, I found help from someone who can possess bodies. He&#39;s currently possessing this cow body and we were wondering why it&#39;s not turning more human when you showed up. Any ideas? Magic is more your thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;He?&quot; She observed Alec with bemused interest. <br />
&quot;Yes, moo..&quot; Blushing he cleared his throat, &quot;me is a he.&quot; Sometimes it feels like the universe wants him to make a fool of himself.<br />
&quot;Possession? I assume it&#39;s a skill?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;I thought so, possession magic is far to taxing to just use like this.&quot; She looked around the area again. &quot;It&#39;s safe to assume the real owner of the body is still inside considering I don&#39;t see any ghosts or any guys running around. So you didn&#39;t trade places.&quot; She got back up, giving him an excellent view of her bald grey slimy vulva. It didn&#39;t look very enticing currently. <br />
&quot;I figure either the host was too far gone when &#39;Alec&#39; took her so she can&#39;t turn back, or because he&#39;s in her body her intrinsic meta-morphological field is disrupted and can&#39;t reconfigure itself properly.&quot;<br />
For a short moment Alec actually felt like a cow, there were a lot of words there, but the meaning was lost on him. Did she say he was causing his host to be stuck like this?<br />
Vivian apparently picked up on that, &quot;He&#39;s not from around here, can you explain for him in English?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;Just for him, I&#39;m sure.&quot; Andrea cocked her head. &quot;Fine, your mind has a map of your body. It allows you to know that you just hurt the smallest toe on your left foot without looking. This map is also used by your...&#39;magical&#39; field.&quot; She made little hand movements with her tiny hands at the word magical. <br />
&quot;A curse disrupts that field, once the curse is broken, your body should take that map and you should reform. This is actually why morphing spells are hard, because the body resists the spell. The witch probably tethered the curse somewhere to keep providing it with mana. However, you have no idea what your host looked like before the curse, so she can&#39;t transform back.&quot;<br />
&quot;And if I just think really hard of a woman?&quot; Alec slurred, not that he could right now.<br />
&quot;Not the same. Thinking &#39;really really hard&#39; of your right toe doesn&#39;t magically make your left toe your right toe.&quot; Making air-quotes with her tiny arms, she threw a questioning sideways glance to Vivian.<br />
Alec started to regret helping Vivian save Andrea at least. <br />
Vivian just shrugged and said &quot;Where are the others?&quot; <br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I lost track of them when I was slithering over the ground. I would&#39;ve expected them to change back at roughly my rate. Even if not all of them had my constitution.&quot; <br />
&quot;Slithering around? So were you the snail creature I saw earlier right?&quot; Alec asked, he somehow felt dumb for saying this even before Andrea threw him an annoyed look.<br />
&quot;I was more of a slug creature actually.&quot;<br />
Vivian got up, she seemed taller already. Though that could also be him being down on all fours. Still her changes seemed to be reverting a lot slower than Andrea&#39;s.<br />
They looked around. Around them were some gasps and groans as some adventurers slowly retook their forms. Though certainly not all were so lucky. <br />
&quot;There&#39;s only women here.&quot; Vivian noted.<br />
&quot;I noticed. We should probably check to see if there are any active tethers left in the cabin before we do anything. While most of the magic went with the witch, some might still be working. Destroying them should help a few extra people.&quot; Andrea looked down on Alec. &quot;I know you&#39;re currently a woman and I&#39;m not very prudish, but I would appreciate it if you stopped staring at my womanhood.&quot;<br />
&quot;He can&#39;t help it, he&#39;s something of a closet pervert.&quot; Vivian said smiling.<br />
&quot;Truly. I think I can guess how you two met then.&quot; Andrea looked at them without smiling. &quot;You beat the witch, so you two go check the cabin first and claim your spoils. I&#39;ll go check on some of the other victims first.&quot; <br />
<br />
To his distress, Andrea started to walk away. &quot;Wait!&quot; He took one step after her, his hind legs rubbed his massive udder sending pleasure through his body. He felt his pussy twitch. &quot;Can&#39;t we go pick up my body first? This body sucks!&quot;<br />
She turned around and looked at Vivian again. &quot;You left his body behind in a swamp? Unattended?&quot;<br />
&quot;We were in a hurry. It should be safe though, I left it under the cloak you warded against swamp creatures.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, if you had that, why weren&#39;t you wearing it? Why did you ask me to look for snakes when you got caught if you had that cloak in your pack?&quot;<br />
Andrea sighed, while Vivian smiled and said, &quot;It keeps them away, it doesn&#39;t make them not exist. If I&#39;d hit or disturbed a snake it would&#39;ve still come after me. And at that point it wouldn&#39;t have fit me anyway.&quot;<br />
&quot;It should be safe under my cloak. Vivian shouldn&#39;t go into the swamp just yet. I may have patched her up, but that might not hold. While I could probably backtrack from your position, as you have clearly noticed, I&#39;m naked and don&#39;t have my arms. We&#39;ll pick it up when we recover some more.&quot; and with that, Andrea turned around and walked away.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like her.&quot; Alec said softly as he watched Andrea walk away.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just your full udders talking. She&#39;s actually really nice once you get to know her.&quot;<br />
&quot;I should just take her body instead. Po..&quot; Vivian moved in a blur and put her hand over his mouth before he could finish.<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t. There may be people around needing medical attention and you don&#39;t have any spell casting experience.&quot; <br />
&quot;Seriously? Can I then please use your body for a bit? These udders hurt like hell.&quot;<br />
&quot;You could, but you don&#39;t know what&#39;s what in a witch&#39;s cabin.&quot; <br />
&quot;You&#39;re not very well versed in magic either. I could just take you and ask Andrea to come along.&quot;<br />
&quot;You want her to come along? Now you&#39;re just not making sense.&quot; She suddenly flashed her mischievous smile and Alec&#39;s eyes went wide.<br />
Before he could respond she was at his flank. &quot;How about if I help you here first?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, Vivian, now is not the ti..hihihi&quot; He gasped as he felt a warm hand grab what felt like his dick, except much more sensitive. The grip was followed by a gentle squeeze and the feeling of something squirting from him. It felt like an orgasm without the build up, just the release. The feeling was less intense, but still very pleasurable. <br />
&quot;Ohh, you liked that?&quot; She was grinning from ear to ear.<br />
He looked at his flank, her hand was holding a teat from one of his udders. &quot;Y..no, just leaaa&quot; he gasped again as a second hand grabbed another teat and squeezed softly again.<br />
&quot;You already look better. Don&#39;t be ashamed.&quot; <br />
Alec gasped, he opened his mouth to protest, but two hands gave a gentle tug on his teats and a shiver ran from his overfilled udders through the rest of his body.<br />
She continued massaging his teats, milk squirted out at every tug. He slumped down on his udders as his knees became weak.<br />
The blissful cloud covered him for what felt like an eternity, even moving to different teats and udders. A pat on the flank woke him from his euphoria. The udders felt much better. He looked around his flank at her as she stood staring mouth agape.<br />
<br />
He followed her eyes, on the ground near his udders was the cutest little kitten he&#39;d ever seen. Short hair brown hair, two tiny tails playing around and an adorable little tuft of fur stuck from each of the triangular ears. <br />
She was lapping up the milk that Vivian had spilled on the ground. <br />
Unfamiliar feelings bubbled up from deep within his body. He needed to feed this little kitten and keep it safe. No I don&#39;t! His mind told him. That&#39;s the Nekomata, right? &quot;Is that the Nekomata?&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Yes. I can&#39;t believe she survived that. What are we going to do with this?&quot;<br />
The maternal feelings came rushing back. &quot;Why isn&#39;t she back to full size with the witch dead?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Maybe because it&#39;s a fresh spell or something?&quot;<br />
He could take that body instead of his current body. But could a Nekomata kitten talk? &quot;Can it talk?&quot;<br />
Vivian crouched and petted the kitten, causing it to purr. &quot;Can you talk?&quot; she cooed at the Nekomata.<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t seem hostile to you at least.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s the same as with humans and the hostility develops during puberty?&quot;<br />
&quot;Milk?&quot; a tiny voice asked. The kitten sat at the ready near one of Alec&#39;s large udders, large brown eyes fixated on the teats.</p>
