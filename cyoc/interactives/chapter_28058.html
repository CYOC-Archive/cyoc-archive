<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So that's how you came to be, is it?" Klondike asked.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah," Tabitha responded. "I guess that wand had the last bit of the genie's magic still in it."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klondike mused for a bit, resting her chin on her fist, then proceeded to bat at her bell around her neck.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So your name is Klondike, huh?" Tabitha asked.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bit long of a name, isn't it? Call me Di for short." Di said somewhat gleefully.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't seem to be taking it as hard as we did."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not at all, in fact. I'm loving this. It's a good change of pace from being a guy, almost like a learning experience."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what if we're stuck like this?" Jasmine spoke up. She had been moody ever since everything took place, speaking not a word as Tabby recounted the story.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then it's a <i>lifelong</i> learning experience," Di said in her cheerful manner.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think so at all," Jasmine marked. "I didn't want this. I mean, I had so much going for me. I finally made starting on the basketball team. I was making headway with that girl I was hitting on. I was popular for once in my life. Now it's all up in smoke! Not only are we going to be the laughingstock of the school, how are we going to get in?! The school won't believe we're three boys turned catgirls!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you remember the paper?" Tabby recalled. "It was a legal document. Chances are the school already knows."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See, one problem down, a few more to go. Lighten up already, Jazz," Di gave a playful nudge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And stop being so cheerful, Derek! Can't you show some dignity for once? You just became a girl!" 'Jazz' seemed to be recomposing herself.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's Di, and how am I not being dignified? You're the one being frumpy and immature."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine didn't respond, but simply crossed her arms and pressed against her pillow, pouting. Di gave a giggle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the trio heard movement outside. Jasmine's parents were home.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you got to go out and talk to them, now." Tabitha remarked.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have to do nothing." Jasmine seemed adamant on staying put. "I think I'll just skip school tomorrow, tell the parents I'm sick. They'll believe me with this voice."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what came next shattered notion. Jasmine's mom called out to her, "Jazz, we're home! Come out here, we need you to help us carry in your clothes."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine was in shock. "What" was all that came out of her mouth, as she made way, stupefied, to her room door.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh good, honey, could you get your clothes out of the car? You have to be ready for tomorrow. You can't wear your old clothes now, can you?" her mother said, as if nothing were wrong about the situation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever semblance of past life that existed in Jasmine's eyes, including the idea of returning it, came crashing around her like an abandoned building. "Bu-bu-but... You got clothes for me? How did---"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course we got clothes for you! Your old clothes won't fit you now, will they? Plus, you needed some new underwear anyways since you don't have any bras to wear, and some feminine care to keep you at your best for those times of the month..."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moooom!" Jasmine said in that embarassed kind of tone, mostly because it felt so strange that her mom was almost unfazed by her change, but partly because Di and Tabby were clearly in earshot.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, don't be embarrassed, they're growing girls too. They know exactly what you have to go through. Speaking of," she said, turning to the other two, "we met your parents while we were out. They weren't shopping as we were; they claim they had it all planned out and done with earlier. They helped us along with it since we never really had to shop for a girl. Give them our thanks when you get home."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will," Di and Tabitha answered in unison.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well well now, hurry up Jazz, it's getting late, and I gotta start dinner. See you later, girls!" And with that, she exited into the kitchen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there was ever a time Jasmine was rigid with disbelief, never could it have rivaled this. "I... I'm a girl," she said wearily. "My parents knew I was a girl. I'm legally known as a girl. My body is that of a girl. Even my friends around me are girls. Inside... am I a girl?" She looked about to faint.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should have mentioned that earlier. The parents have adjusted to you being a girl. Another problem down." Tabitha said. Di began to fan Jazz to cool her down.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I'm going to get my clothes now... Y-you guys go on home. Dinner will be almost ready for me, so you two should leave."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will you be alright?" Tabby asked. "I mean, even now it looks like you're worse than ever."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I-I'm fine," Jasmine replied with an uncharacteristic coolheadedness. "Everything's good. You two go on ahead now. Bye bye."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay..." Tabitha could see that Jasmine wasn't fine, but it was obvious that only she could make it better. "Don't break down, now."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seriously, I'll be fine. Goodbye." Jasmine said. She gave both Di and Tabitha a hug, then went out to the door to unpack the car.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So... that was fun," Di remarked.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, but I feel sorry for Jazz. She seems totally unstable now. I hope she doesn't break down."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, she seemed fine to me. It just took a while for her to accept that she is a girl."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I doubt she accepted that. Maybe she's just playing along. Maybe she still thinks it's all in her head."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, if so, then tomorrow will be a fun day at school, won't it?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tabitha couldn't stop worrying about Jasmine. Eventually the two met their breakpoint and headed different ways, back to their families who were well aware of what they became and welcomed it with open arms. Di took a bath, admiring her new form and taking in the bath salts her mother got for her. Jasmine, still spiritless, sat down to a good meal with her family, discussing her new life in detail with her parents. Tabitha got home, slipped into her fresh nightgown, and bundled up in her blankets. Tomorrow, indeed, would be a very interesting experience, as Di put it. She said a little prayer for Jasmine's sake, and drifted off to sleep.<br></p>
