<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Huh!?” William jumps up, startled, “Jesus Lila,” he rubs his eyes, coming back to his senses, “you want me to make a wish... now?” She says looking over at the clock on the wall,<br />
“I want that wish whether you like it or not, and I want that wish right now!”<br />
“Can we not wait until the morning?”<br />
“It is the morning... technically...”<br />
“The actual morning, it’s way too early, I don’t even think it will work,”<br />
“Well then try it and if it doesn’t work then you go back to sleep, seem fair,”<br />
“I mean it-”<br />
“I don’t care, you tried to make me a giant today so not buts!”<br />
“That would’ve been yesterday, actually,”<br />
“Shut up,”<br />
<br />
William and Lila stood up. William stretched as he sat on the couch,<br />
“Alright, I’m ready when you are. I’m guessing you want me to fix the problem I made yesterday?”<br />
“Hmm...” Lila thought for a second, “nope!”<br />
“Huh?”<br />
“I want you to wish that I had your daily wish power too. So we both have one wish every day,”<br />
“Umm... I’m not sure if I can do that,” William said, semi-nervously,<br />
“Why not?”<br />
“Well when I got the wish I got a little note, it said that only I have the power,”<br />
“Well...” Lila was stumped, “just try it!” She whined at him suddenly, “I’ll fix your little wish from yesterday with it and I’ll get the benefits out of it as well, it’s totally fair!”<br />
“Okay okay,” William said, “I’ll do it,”<br />
“Okay!!” Lila was very pleased, she sat with anticipation on her face,<br />
“I wish that not only do I get the Daily Wish, but Lila Parkin, also has the Daily Wish, and she is able to make one wish per day, the same way I do, the same rules, the same restrictions,”<br />
<br />
Lila sat there, waiting patiently, excitedly, for the wish to take effect.<br />
After a few seconds of silence, her face turned to a frown, disappointment all over her face.<br />
“Uhh... Lila. I think it worked,”<br />
“Huh?” Lila said, her face back to neutral intrigue, “it did?”<br />
“Well... there’s only one way to find out, right?”<br />
<br />
“Oh! Right.” Lila sat up straight, ready to make her wish,<br />
“I wish,” she began, she opened her mouth, but stopped, she closed it, she began to think, “Nevermind that!” She said out loud, “since you tried to change me yesterday, you’re gonna pay for it!” She snuck a little devilish grin at him, <br />
“What!? You said you were going to change the people back!?”<br />
“They can deal with big boobs and... massive... dicks... for a day,”<br />
“I’m so confused,”<br />
“Good.” Lila said, “I wish that William... becomes... ummm...” she thinks for a second, then an idea sparks in her mind, “like super fat!” She was ready to make her wish, “and...”<br />
“What the hell!!” William shouted, “this is so-” Lila interrupted him,<br />
“Also I become fat as well,” she finished her wish,<br />
“Huh?” He was confused,<br />
“Listen, I’m not having you get to be the only one being fat for the day. For one, I’m really skinny and I don’t plan on ever being fat, so this is a one time experience... and you for you... well you just have to be fat for the day,” she giggled.<br />
<br />
William looked down, it had begun. It seemed to him that he was going to change before Lila was.<br />
He saw his belly push forwards. It pushed his t-shirt. He watched as the t-shirt continued to move, he felt his expanding belly push at his jeans. He felt his jeans around the legs get tighter all of a sudden. He looked down at his thighs, seeing them very slowly fill up. As he watched, his vision began to get obscured as his belly got larger. He put his focus back to his belly, which obscured him from looking at his feet without bending forwards.<br />
He looked at his belly as it grew, he noticed that his chest had begun growing too. Moobs began forming, laying on his growing belly, though not huge yet.<br />
His sides began to grow, love handles had started to form on them. <br />
His arms were also growing at this point, thicker and thicker. They were now filling the whole t-shirt arms.<br />
<br />
William stood up, wobbling a little as he did, his body jiggled with his movements.<br />
Lila looked at him, she had a devilish grin on her face. Though as she watched him fill up, she started to question her decision to make herself fat, but too late now, she couldn’t back away from what was going to happen to her.<br />
<br />
William looked as his body grew. He felt more and more fat add to his neck as his developed his first double chin, easily visible to Lila who was watching, as he continued to point his head down to look at his belly. At this point he realised that his belly was starting to spill out of the bottom of his shirt, not before pushing harder and harder on his jeans.<br />
It grew and pushed until it finally...<br />
POP!<br />
The button flew right off his jeans, the zip unzipped itself as his thighs grew thicker and meatier around them. His jeans fell down to the ground, his thighs hadn’t quite got a great grasp on them for them not to fall. Lila looked with delight at his obvious embarrassment.<br />
His belly grew further and further outwards, as well as it grew further sideways. The sides of his shirt were filling with fat, spilling now slightly out of the sides and even the back. His white underwear, which was luckily just underneath his belly, was slowly being covered by it, the front of his belly had drooped down to touch his penis.<br />
Above the belly, his moobs. They had grown larger than before, flat but full. They spread on more and more of the ever expanding belly. His thighs were now bigger than his head. Not to mention his butt. Each cheek was the size of a soccer ball. William finally moved his arms to touch his body. His arms were around the size of his thighs before the wish was made. He grabbed his belly, attempting to lift it up. His fingers sunk into his flesh. He felt his belly continue to grow in his hands, it felt... strange, he didn’t know if he enjoyed the feeling or not. But one thing he knew, he didn’t like being this fat. And he knew he wasn’t done yet. He took his hands off his belly, it flopped down, jiggling. He cupped his slow expanding moobs, they were floppy, not as firm as his belly. He moved his hands over to his butt, barely making their way to it with how little area there was to move. He grabbed each cheek with each hand and squeezed. It was more pleasurable than his belly or moobs. But he did not enjoy it being that big. His hips had also widened considerably, to hold the massive cargo on them. He let go of his butt and moved his hands back to the front. He grabbed his thighs. After his belly, they were the fastest growing part of him. He finally put his hands on his double chin, or rather now his quadruple chin. His neck fat blended into his torso like nothing, it didn’t even look like he had a neck. Then all of a sudden he noticed his fingers, he held them out in front of him. His fingers were thicker, they were chubbier. Not huge, but naturally they all touched together.<br />
It was at this point that his body couldn’t change, only expands. He looked as his belly grew further out. It was beginning to cover up the view Lila’s feet. His belly grew, wider and wider. His butt was now the size of two watermelons. His moobs were the size of melons, some flat melons.<br />
His body nearly as big the single seated armchair that Lila was sitting in.<br />
Then, he felt his growth stop. The feeling of being filled up with flesh had ceased suddenly. He was stood up. His whole body was huge, it was thick. His thighs were massive, his belly broad, moobs massive, butt bulbous, neck non-existant. His face was so chubby he almost looked cute.<br />
Lila began to laugh,<br />
“It’s not funny,” William said. As he spoke, his chins rippled the tiniest bit, not enough for Lila to notice, but enough for William to feel it.<br />
“Give me a little spin,” Lila said, still giggling,<br />
“No!” William said, angrily,<br />
“Just do it! You deserve this,”<br />
“Ugh!” William began to move, he moved his legs, his bare thighs rubbed together. As he turned to the side, Lila saw how big his butt was. This made her burst into laughter again. He continued to turn, his body jiggling as he did it. His belly has spilled so far out of his shirt that his belly button was so far out his shirt. He finished the 360 turn, not before looking right at Lila as he noticed something.<br />
“What?” She asked him, smirking at the blimp in front of her. She looked down, “oh yeah...” she said, “my turn,”<br />
<br />
Lila looked down, as she was sitting, she saw her belly began to grow. Like William, it pushed on her t-shirt. It grew bigger, filling out the sides of her shirt too. As she was sitting, she saw her thighs begin to thicken too. She remembered Williams change and looked at her arms. They were thickening too. She looked at her fingers. Ever so slowly they grew, not easy to spot. She looked down at her chest, her A cup chest was growing. Not the first time. It wasn’t growing bigger, it was growing fatter. Luckily she didn’t have A bra on, but it was a different feeling than before. She saw her belly touch her lap, spilling on her legs. She realised that her face was getting chubbier, her double chin was beginning to form.<br />
Her belly grew more and more, spilling on her legs. Her boobs growing bigger and bigger, at this point they looked like C’s or D’s, just more flabby. Her legs were now thicker than her head. Her hips were also expanding more and more. Her butt was pushing her off the chair more and more, they were probably the size of soccer balls by now. Her belly reached two thirds of a way across her legs when all of a sudden.<br />
She stopped growing,<br />
<br />
She looked at herself. She felt her double chin, she grabbed her belly. She stood up. She grabbed her butt, her thighs, her boobs. She hadn’t even gotten to half the size of William, but she had stopped.<br />
“What!?” William shouted, birds outside the house were heard to fly away, “I grew to this big and you... you..!”<br />
<br />
They’d good in silence, until finally,<br />
<br />
“Bah haha!!“ Lila laughed, wobbling around as she did, struggling to keep her balance. She couldn’t stop herself from laughing. She managed to get a few words out, “I- I just- I just realised that I wished you to be super fat! And- and I wished myself to just be... FAT!!” she continued to laugh,<br />
<br />
“This is so unfair!!” William repeated, “I don’t want to be the fattest one here, if I’m fat then you-” William paused, his face gave the look of an idea in his head.</p>
