<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ric yelped as he woke up from fright. The panting, terrified man looked around; there was nobody there, not even his two sex dolls. Ric rubbed his now-moist face with his hands while trying to remember what happened. He remembered having the time of his life with Jelinda and Francisca... but then a feeling of dread had come over him, and he remembered feeling his skin shift and move and.... and...  <br />
<br />
Ric shook his head in confusion. Was it all a dream? After all, if something like that had happened he wouldn't still be himself right? Ric shook his head again, this time in an effort to shake out what remained of his confusion. He got up from his bed and grinned. &quot;Why should I be afraid of some dream?&quot; He said, not noticing his voice had slightly raised in pitch. Ric decided to go look for his curiously-missing girls as he was; sure he was completely naked right now... but the girls sure as hell would not mind something like that no? <br />
<br />
Ric reached for the door... and froze when he saw his reflection in the mirror hanging from the door. His body had been altered noticeably: he had aged from his late teens to his early twenties, but despite the age increase his body had actually stayed the same size and instead had become slightly more curvy and slender. On top of that his general frame looked somewhat more feminine and his slightly longer hair, while still primarily black, now had prominent red highlights in them. Ric just gaped at his reflection, completely shocked at what had happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;...So I see you like your changes, hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ric yelped at the sudden voice, but couldn't see who had talked to him. &quot;Don't bother looking,&quot; the voice said, &quot;I'm not in any place that you can look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you? Do you know what the hell happened to me!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez, calm down would you?&quot; The voice said, and with that Ric suddenly lost his will to shout and panic, &quot;There, that's better. Anyways, I'll answer your questions since there's not much for me to do: First, I'm the one who changed you like that, and the reason I could do that is because I took possession of your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ric's mouth opened to say something, but couldn't find any words to say. The voice giggled, &quot;I can see why you're confused... I managed to possess you through the book. I was sealed in there, but over the millenia managed to... &quot;influence&quot; the book and alter a person's mental and physical energy wavelengths to be suitable as my host.<br />
<br />
&quot;S..sealed?&quot; Ric barely managed to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sealed. I was originally a fox demon who acted just like any other fox demons, until a sorceror showed me just how awesome it would be to become a witch, especially when combined with the Fox magic I already have. Of course, I THINK I may have gotten a bit too power-hungry, hence why I was stuck in the book... until now&quot; The last part being said in a lustful, mischievous manner did little to calm Ric down.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice sighed again. &quot;Didn't I tell you I was possessing you? I'm going to make this body just like my original one. Problem is, I've been away for so long that my magic needs some recharging, and that can only be done by creating mana links with servants. Fortunately, there were two that you recently altered that already helped me improve my control over this thing....&quot;<br />
<br />
As if on cue, two girls completely foreign to Ric popped in with coy, mischievous grins on their faces. Ric had never seen them before - at least as himself - but he knew who the girls were thanks to the fox-witch's influence; the blue-haired girl was the now-nonexistent Francisca, while the other was the equally-nonexistent Jelinda. &quot;Ooooh, you look cute enough to eat,&quot; the blue haired girl said, licking her lips, &quot;Too bad master wants us to do other stuff... though we can play afterwards!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two girls leaped at Rick and pinned him to the bed with surprising strength. &quot;Wait, WAIT!&quot; Ric shouted, &quot;what are you girls doin-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told them to do that,&quot; the fox-witch replied in his head, &quot;I've recovered more than enough now, so I want to come out and play some more. Besides, maybe coming out will help me adapt to my new body!&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Ric could argue or struggle, the light-brown-haired girl formely known as Jelinda leaned down and gently brushed her hand up Ric's slightly-feminized chest. Ric gasped at the sensations he felt; he knew that this was not how he should normally feel from just a touch, but... Jelinda didn't stop, instead using both her hands to twirl around Ric's breast. Ric couldn't help but gasp again in pleasure, and felt his chest suddenly start to shift again. He fought against the urges, mentally pushing down the budding nipples... but his will power was weakened as the blue-haired girl formerly known as Francisca started to carress his lower sides and legs, resulting with Ric's pleasure increasing tenfold. His entire body started to shift despite his mental fight, and he quickly lost his battle as the body shifted more and more into the Witch's. Franciska starting kissing and licking Ric's pelvis, and continued her licking as Ric's manlihood completely sunk into him and became the female equivalent, allowing her to pleasure her now-in-control mistress. As the breasts increased, the brown-haired girl started carressing them, and the witch jerked forward in pleasure as the breasts grew slightly larger than before and her curves became more apparent. The witch eventually orgasmed, and her mental link with her servants caused them to stop what they were doing out of pleasure. After the three bathed in the afterglow, the witch got up and looked at her body; it was slowly becoming like her original one alright... though she guessed that it would still be a while before her gorgeous fox ears and tail would appear. She shrugged; the Witch wasn't that worried about it, since it woud come in due time. What she was excited about instead was how she now had several hours worth of transformation time, thus allowing her to go out and have her version of a &quot;fun time&quot;. She grinned mischievously at her servants, who grinned back despite still being out of it from the experience. &quot;Oh this will be a reallly fun trip,&quot; she said to herself.&quot;</p>
