<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty would take a moment looking at the girl who had just poured her heart to him. A girl that in his past has always been there with him through everything, but it wasn’t real was it? The memories, the feelings, the sense of belonging to a group of people who genuinely cared for him in his life as an orphan. <br />
<br />
“I would love to” Ty smiled the words spoke for themselves escaping his lips to his surprise as if his heart truly felt this way. “I would love to be your boyfriend Jill” he said again with more confidence knowing that this is really how he felt about her despite the fact it wasn’t all real. Jill blushed even harder as she looked to her first crush the very first boyfriend she has ever had and hopefully the husband of her future. “You…you really…” she stammered the words coming out shaky due to the emotions she has swirling around her body, her heart beating faster. <br />
<br />
Ty smiled knowing what she wanted to say “I do mean it” he said reassuring her that those were indeed the words he had meant. Jill leapt to Ty and hugged him tightly “ooof hey don’t kill me” he mocked as she squeezed him tightly so filled with joy and relief. She backed away from him “sorry sorry I just didn’t expect you actually want to be my boyfriend”. Jill brushed her hair loose hair behind her ear and smiled “ we should tell Eileen when she gets out of the shower” Jill stated to Ty who nodded in agreement<br />
<br />
Ty stood up from the couch and reached out his hand for Jill to grab on to. She did so reluctantly. “18” Ty said under his breath a new word similar to the words he used to have for himself and Eileen when they would explore his power. “Did you say something Ty?” Jill asked feeling an odd sensation go through out her body. “I did yes but you’ll see what I meant soon” he said smiling still holding Jill’s hand. Immediately Ty began feeling  the same sensation go throughout his 14 year old body ‘this must’ve been what Eileen and Jill felt when they got older’ he thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Ty had decided to make his two friends including himself 18 so that they may have the freedom to live their new lives without having to start all over. With his 18 phrase they would all grow to 18 years old with the rest of the world changing to fit along with their new ages. <br />
<br />
Just then Jill let out a soft moan “what is this feeling” she said being a virgin all over again with no real memory of her past she was unfamiliar with the sensation going through her 14 year old body. “Don’t worry Jill it’s not painful is it?” Ty said as he starts to slowly get an erection due to the pleasure going through his body. Jill shook her head slowly falling to the floor on her knees “it feels so good” she says as she bites her lip. The trio gained a year and our now sitting at the age of 15. <br />
<br />
Ty’s body was aging rapidly as he had already a shot up to 15 and only growing from there. Where he was now was standing at 5’5 with his brown curly hair surprisingly kept in good shape as it didn’t grow too much from what it was, his skin start to show signs of acne on his face and a little on his arms “this feels pretty good” he said his voice cracking slightly as his Adams apple was still in the process of being mature. The clothes he was wearing were starting to grow along with his body which was different than how his power used to work maybe due to his age increasing his power over his ability was also maturing. <br />
<br />
Jill on the other hand had also aged to 15 and was still in the process of growing she stood at 5’4 at this age with her blonde hair growing slightly past her neck to her shoulders. Her breast budding to a B cup as her body starts to grow slightly curvy her thin frame blossoming outward due to her rapid aging her thighs seem to grow wider giving her a more shapely design with more changes still to come. <br />
<br />
Upstairs you can hear moaning as Ty assumes Eileen is going through her changes as well “it’s ok only a little more to go” he says as his body shoots up another few years to the age of 17. As the trio change the home starts to change around Jill and Ty as Ty collapses to the floor from the sheer pleasure his body is being put through. <br />
<br />
Ty’s body has grown quite a bit since he was 15 a few seconds ago. He now stands at 5’10 his hair grown around his slimmer face as his jaw has become slightly more pronounced than it was when he was 15 with small amounts of facial hair growing around his chin and up his jaw. The acne that had plagued his face and his arms have vanished leaving him free of anymore blemishes. Ty looked to Jill who was now pleasuring her body as she had also aged to 17, he could tell her body was a lot more developed and mature at this age that seemed to carry well into her adult years as her breast were now D cup as her ass had grown shapely and round similarly to Eileen at this age. He noticed her hair was longer and more wavy the more it went down as it reached just past her shoulders. Her face started to develop some light freckles around her nose and cheeks. The glasses she had worn now seemed to change to better fitting lenses than the ones she had prior to the change Ty assumed this is before she started wearing contacts due to her lack of confidence in her appearance. Ty was none the less surprised that she still looked beautiful. Jill’s body had grown substantially taller than Ty as she stood at 5’11 which would be her height until she lost some in her late 30’s. <br />
<br />
After they finally reached their new age of 18 the feeling of pure ecstasy had vanished leaving two young adults on the ground coated with beads of sweat. “Ty” Jill said standing up slowly she turned to him surprised to see the young man standing before her “Ty oh my gosh look at you” she said adjusting her glasses as if what she was seeing couldn’t be real. “Yeah…I thought if we would date each other we should skip the awkward years” his laughed trailed. His new voice was free of any cracked or wavy pitch. “Oh Ty but what about your childhood, what about our relationship” she said starting to freak slightly not remembering ever growing up. “It’s ok Jill I haven’t skipped our relationship or anything for that matter I just changed everything around the three of us, we were always friends throughout our lives from the age of 6, you still had a crush on me since you were 12 and we all grew up naturally, our lives just took a bit to get to this point that’s all, everyone knows we’ve been here and  that you, Eileen and I are still friends”. Ty stated seeming very calm about everything knowing nothing too spontaneous happened “I still said yes to being your boyfriend but instead of it being when we were 14 it was instead a few moments ago we still have a lot of dating and first time things to try” he said holding her hand “I wouldn’t have skipped anything important” he looked at her. <br />
<br />
Jill felt calmer knowing she was important to him just as much as he was to her. She smiled slightly “thank you” she said as she leaned in for a kiss until Eileen interrupted “Ty you mischievous little boy” she smiled she was standing in a towel wrapped around that amazing body he loved so much “you two are going to be so cute together” Eileen hugged her two best friends Jill and Ty blushed</p>
