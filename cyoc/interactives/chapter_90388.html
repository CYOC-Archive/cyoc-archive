<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer decided to dry herself first, but couldn&#39;t find a towel of any sorts. &quot;Ah well, screw it! Its not like I&#39;ve never been wet and naked&quot; Jennifer said as she thought of forms she wanted to be in. Somehow, she felt more comfortable in forms that still retained her normal fleshy color, it kinda reminded her that she was just a human, but had powers that no one had. But she thought, &quot;If I were to taste that wonderful meat again, the raw flesh, I might as well start changing my skin color to blend in, helps with my hunting anyways.&quot; Jennifer really wanted to practice her powers so that she would be extremely comfortable with it, and could change her form in a blink of an eye, and do it as if it were second nature. She reminded herself that she needed to concentrate to shape her body, which could be a problem, since she didn&#39;t want time delays if she were to defend or kill something. She went back to the basics, and practiced on detaching herself. She willed herself to fall to pieces, and few seconds later, she broke down. She then concentrated on re-assembling, and few seconds later she was back in one piece. She practiced this for around half an hour until she was able to detach and reattach instantaneously. She then went onto smaller parts of her body, and  tried to crumble like sand. It took her quite a while, but she got the hang of it, and crumbled into tiny bits of flesh. She then reassembled herself, and put on a show. She whirled around, as if a wind was blowing, and condensed, and BAM, she was standing again. She repeated the process, but got the hand of it quickly, and did this with a simple thought, crumbling and reassembling in a blink of an eye. <br />
<br />
Jennifer then practiced on growing body parts. She knew that she won&#39;t be able to do this instantaneously, but she did want to speed it up. She grew an arm, and it took her quite a while to fully grow an arm, and she reabsorbed it, doing it slightly faster than growing it. She again practiced, and mastered the ability, and grew limbs quickly, even more than one at the same time. She was rather happy with her results, she was quickly mastering her body and powers! Achieving mind over matter was important for a body that required lots of work to do what she wants to do like hers. Jennifer then tried to grow out eyes, since she felt that growing eyes and getting used to them will be a more difficult task, and may take time to get used to. Jennifer started by growing an eyeball on her forehead. Suddenly, her vision expanded, but Jennifer didn&#39;t think much about it. She then added another eyeball, things got slightly disorienting then. She got used to it and walked around the room using her four eyes. Jennifer then absorbed her new eyes, and grew eyes on different locations on her body, until Jennifer felt that she can quickly adapt to the new point of vision she would have every time she changed the location of her eyeball. She thought the instance where her eyes were her nipples was pretty funny, her vision bouncing as she was walking, thanks to her generous growth hormones, granting her large breasts. Jennifer could now get used to her sight in an instance, but there was still stretching and melting to handle.<br />
<br />
Jennifer reverted back to her original form, and concentrated on melting just into a puddle. She focused her mind and took at most half a minute until she fully melted into a puddle. She felt this was too long, and reformed, which surprisingly took less that 3 seconds. &quot;Well, at least reforming is taken care of.&quot; Jennifer said as she practiced some more. With practice, she melted as quickly as she reformed, and her movements while in a liquid were very smooth. Jennifer then practiced on making liquid mass, she figured that this could be a good fighting tactic, since she can overflow her opponent with her own liquid flesh. She concentrated on her own belly, and waited until her belly started to grow and ripple, as if vines were writhing under it, until it burst into a waterfall of her flesh. But the rate of her flesh pouring wasn&#39;t quick enough do to real damage or to surprise the enemy/prey, so Jennifer reabsorbed again. She repeated this process until she was satisfied that she could instantaneously burst open on any part of her body, and pour her flesh out at tremendous speeds. She even surprised herself when she accidentally overflowed the cabin, and her flesh began pouring on the outer walls of the cabin, making her flesh coat around the cabin. This gave her a new idea of perhaps ambushing prey. She leaned against a corner, and pushed herself towards the corner, stretching upwards and her legs going downwards whilst doing so, stretching her whole body across the room, coving the ceiling, the walls and the ground. She saw that the room was literally made out of her flesh! She could manipulate every part of the &quot;room&quot; and could surprise enemies by doing so. She practiced so that she could do this quickly, which meant that it can also be a good hiding technique. But Jennifer realized that she was still in her fleshy color, which doesn&#39;t help in hiding, meaning that she had to also change her color to match the wall she is adhering to. She pealed a bit of herself off, and tried to mimic the color of the wall, which was a light grey. She saw her skin swirl with her skin tone, and then a grey color appeared, and she even mimicked windows! She was impressed by her speed! She melted off the wall instantly and reformed in the middle of the room. She then practiced stretching, but it was already very fast, and didn&#39;t require much practice for her to stretch in any part on her body, even her skin to create tentacles. Reshaping her hands to form weapons was easy, and her flesh from her wrists poured onto her palm and surrounded it, forming maces and swords. Jennifer knew she could form weapons on any part of her body, and felt that she was prepared. But she felt that there might be slight modifications needed to her body for hunting...<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at the mirror, and stared at herself. She knew that the hair was a hassle, and could be a disadvantage to her when fighting. She was reluctant, but absorbed her hair and grew fleshy colored tentacles in its place and colored it blond yellow, so that she could still blend in with society, but it could serve as defense of offense. She then made her hands form small hooks on her palm, same on her feet, so that she could climb walls to stay out of sight. But overall, if there were any changes required, she could do it instantaneously. Now its time for some fun! Jennifer stood back up, and detached her leg from her torso. She grew another set and detached those too. She did this until she had 50 pairs of her own legs. She then plucked off her breasts and regrew them and did this until she also had 50 pairs of breasts. She then grew a torso from her crouch, erasing her crouch whilst doing so. She then put her breasts onto the torso and put a pair of legs on its hips. She did this for 50 times until she connected all her pieces together, forming a human centipede! Jennifer was humongous, and needed to maneuver her large body quickly. She replaced her arms with legs, and just for gigs, added feeler on her forehead and ripped her cheeks apart, and grew her incisors into massive proportions, forming mandibles. The looked at the mirror, and the long body kinda turned her on, all of her forms turned her on! She didn&#39;t know why but it sure did. She walked outside of the cabin, and went into the lake, growing her gills again. She went to the bottom, and laid there. She circled her body around her, and formed a spiral, compacting her skin against herself. It felt very sexual, but relaxing and warm, and Jennifer went to sleep, in the bottom of the lake.</p>
