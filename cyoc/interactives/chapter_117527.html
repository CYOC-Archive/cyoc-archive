<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack’s eye lids flutter as he moans in pleasure. With his wife giving him head as they sat in the back of the limo; Jack was unaware that the intercom button was on, giving the driver an earful as to what is happening between husband and wife.<br />
“Fuck Kenya,” Jack panting; squirming in his seat as he feels his climax mounting. “I’m not going to be able to hold back soon.”<br />
<br />
Kenya doesn’t say a word as she continues to deep throat Jack’s stiff shaft. Bobbing up and down on it and using her tongue to tickle and stimulate his glans. Jack’s moaning and grunting was all she needed to hear to know how pleased her mate was. With Jack placing his hands behind Kenya’s head, helping to guide her as she provides the mother of all blow jobs; Kenya’s eye’s go wide as she tastes Jack’s warm salty cum explode and fill her mouth.<br />
<br />
“God dam,” Jack smiling as he enjoys the bliss he is in; “you sure know how to use that tongue of yours.”<br />
“It’ll be more fun,” Kenya slowly climbing up on Jack; “if we could go all the way.”<br />
“I’m game,” Jack smiling; “but sex in a moving limo can be difficult.”<br />
“But not impossible,” Kenya positioning herself; ensuring Jack’s still stiff member presses up on her pantie covered sex.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
 “This is Deputy Chase, in pursuit of the limousine. Last seen traveling down on Range Road just at the town line. Requesting back up; local and State!”<br />
<br />
Douglas Cooper snarled as he heard Deputy Chase’s request for assistance. In a foul mood as everything and everyone has so far successfully conspired to interrupt his were-wedding with Joan Morningcloud. But the fact that the vehicle with the suspects in question are already out of the town’s jurisdiction meant that all he could do was assist the State Troopers in taking down and arresting Jack and Kenya.<br />
“Forget having those appear before the elder council Tachibana,” Douglas putting his civilian car in gear; “State Troopers are going to take them to jail,” Douglas muttering to himself.<br />
“All units all available units,” Douglas speaking through his radio; “converge on deputy Chase’s last sighting and assist as requested. Dispatch contact the State Police and request assistance for a possible highway pursuit.”<br />
<br />
Putting the radio down, Douglas cell phone starts ringing as he was driving. Looking at the caller I.D, the sheriff glowers as he can see Tachibana was the one trying to get in touch with him.<br />
“Well this is one call I don’t relish to have,” Douglas activating his hands free device.<br />
“Yet I need an update on Jack and Kenya Crawford’s apprehension,” Tachibana answering.<br />
“They were last seen leaving in a limousine,” Douglas answering; “that limousine is by all accounts on the highway on the way to Seattle.”<br />
“That is not acceptable,” Tachibana responding; “they are to be present at the elder council building tomorrow.”<br />
“Well it seems they have other ideals,” Douglas retorting; “with the state police getting involved, Jack and Kenya will be languishing in one of their jails for the assault on Nate Anderson. Assuming of course the Crawford’s lawyer doesn’t manage to finagle the couples release before they appear before a judge.”<br />
“Who on the state police do you know is one of us,” Tachibana having to digest what Douglas just mentioned.”<br />
“Eugene Talbot,” Douglas immediately answering; “but he could be anywhere in the State of Washington at the moment. There are others,” Douglas adding; “but they tend to be discreet even with me. What are you getting at?”<br />
“The Luna brotherhood generally helps apprehend wanted were’s,” Tachibana responding; “but after what happened regarding Julie Stovall and your cousin…”<br />
“I’m aware,” Douglas pulling onto the highway to try and catch up with any deputies all racing after the Crawford limousine.<br />
<br />
Douglas Cooper lost his cousin Alyssa Cooper last year after Julie Stovall went rogue. The young wer-mer escaping the elder council and getting help from Alyssa in trying to get to Seattle and eventually Puget Sound. The two wer-mer’s were betrayed by Alyssa’s friend and apprehended by the Seattle chapter of the Luna Brotherhood. The same brotherhood killed Alyssa after Julie refused to play their game of being hunted like prey. Alyssa’s death resulted in the were-grizzly finding out his estranged cousin had a son named Darrell and a were-tigress friend that acted as a second mother and nanny. The death of Alyssa Cooper resulted in the chapter being dissolved and arrested after chasing Julie back into Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
“Tachibana,” Douglas taking a moment to think; “unless you are willing to break multiple state laws and risk exposing the existence of were’s to the world, Jack and Kenya Crawford will never be back in Moon Lake to answer whatever crimes the council is levying against them.”<br />
“They will when state police transfer them over to you to face charges,” Tachibana answering; “Nate Anderson and his parents will press charges i can see to that.”<br />
“Assuming of course,” Douglas snapping back; “that the Crawford lawyer doesn’t bury the case in motions and procedures. Throwing evidence out, requesting a change of venue,” Douglas wanting this call to end; “you know; all those tricks, lawyers do to keep their clients out of jail.”<br />
 “You’re forgetting one thing,” Tachibana sighing; “Benton Knight will have something to say about that. Those two have a history.”<br />
“Your problem,” Douglas feeling exasperated; “not mine.”<br />
<br />
Douglas disconnects the call as he races down the highway; getting closer to the group of police cruisers that have surrounded a black limousine.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
The limo driver was finding it difficult to ignore the noises of sex coming from the back of his vehicle as he was driving down the highway. Remembering that the Crawford’s were important clients for the car service he worked for; the driver was half smiling as he listened to Kenya screaming in joy in between her moans and sighs.<br />
“Horny couple,” the driver thinks to himself; unaware that Jack and Kenya were both were-panthers.<br />
<br />
 Unable to look through the rearview mirror without getting a good look of the half-naked woman riding her husband; the driver was unaware of the police cruisers that have now begun to follow the limo.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
“Oh Yeah,” Kenya screaming in joy; feeling Jack inside her and twitching. Spilling his seed in her as she helps Jack fondle her exposed breasts.<br />
“You satisfied,” Jack looking at Kenya’s eyes flutter as she enjoys her post orgasmic bliss.<br />
“Hmmm,” Kenya sighs; “for now. But I will want some more later on.”<br />
“After we get back to Seattle,” Jack looking at his cell phone for any messages; “until then, let’s just cuddle.”<br />
“Why are there a whole bunch of police cruisers following us,” Kenya looking out the rearview window after opening her eyes.<br />
<br />
Jack looking at Kenya in confusion gets up from his seat to see several state trooper vehicles and a few Moon Lake Cruisers all with their lights flashing.<br />
“Don’t tell me,” Jack thinking for a second before grabbing his phone; “those idiots must have screwed up. No wonder they haven’t contacted me.”<br />
“Who screwed up,” Kenya doing her best to make herself decent.<br />
“The two I instructed to rough up Nate Anderson,” Jack still unaware that the intercom was still on, letting the driver listen in to what was going on in the back.<br />
“You calling your lawyer,” Kenya looking back again as the police cruisers as getting closer.<br />
“Sir,” the driver speaking up, making Jack and Kenya’s blood run cold. “The police are back, and I doubt it’s in regards to the broken tail light.<br />
“Did you hear everything,” Jack scrambling to scrub his phone of anything incriminating.<br />
“From you two having sex to you mentioning about having someone roughed up,” the driver pulling over; “threats or no threats, I’m not risking jail.”</p>
