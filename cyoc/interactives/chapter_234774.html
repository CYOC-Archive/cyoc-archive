<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, after another exhausting workout that did little to stem his weight gain, he found himself hungrier than ever. Pablo, ever attentive, had prepared a large meal—steak, mashed potatoes, and a side of buttery vegetables. Without thinking, Juan dug in, eating ravenously.<br />
<br />
Pablo watched as Juan devoured the meal with a hunger he had never seen in him before. His once disciplined approach to eating had given way to an insatiable appetite. Pablo noticed how Juan’s belly seemed to swell slightly more after each meal, his body eagerly absorbing every calorie. The changes were becoming more rapid, and with them, Juan’s demeanor shifted. He seemed less concerned about the weight he was gaining, and more focused on satisfying his growing hunger.<br />
<br />
Later that evening, as they sat on the couch, Pablo brought up the topic again, hoping to ease Juan’s concerns further. &quot;You know, Juan, there’s something pretty amazing about embracing who you are. You’ve always been disciplined, controlled. Maybe… maybe this is a chance to let go a little, to see yourself in a new light.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juan, feeling the warmth of a full stomach and the comfort of Pablo’s words, leaned back, his hand resting on his belly. He still felt the unease of change, but Pablo’s encouragement made him feel a little better about it. “Maybe you’re right,” he said slowly. “But it’s hard to get used to. I’ve always been the fit one, the guy who keeps things under control.”<br />
<br />
Pablo smiled, sensing an opportunity. “But being fit doesn’t mean being thin or hairless. There’s strength in size”<br />
<br />
Juan thought about it, it was true that despite the unwanted weight gain, he has started to feel stronger than ever, and manlier. Maybe this was not as bad as he first thought, maybe he could one day accept his bigger and hairier frame. <br />
<br />
Juan chuckled softly, though his eyes still held some doubt. “It’s just… it’s a lot to take in. I’m not used to seeing myself like this.”<br />
<br />
“I know,” Pablo replied, leaning closer. “But I think you’re starting to like it, even if it’s just a little. And I… well, I can’t help but find you even more irresistible.”<br />
<br />
Juan felt a surge of warmth, both from Pablo’s words and from within. Maybe this transformation wasn’t something to fight, but something to embrace. It was a new version of himself, one that Pablo clearly admired. And perhaps, deep down, he could learn to admire it too.<br />
<br />
As the days passed, Juan couldn&#39;t escape the changes happening to his body, no matter how hard he tried. Every morning he would stand in front of the mirror, staring at his reflection in disbelief. What once had been a lean, muscular torso had transformed into something unrecognizable: his once-flat stomach had grown into a large, rounded belly, stretching the waistband of his underwear and forming a soft overhang. His pectoral muscles, once firm and defined, had begun to sag, slowly turning into the beginnings of moobs. <br />
<br />
The most unsettling change was the hair. Thick, dark hair sprouted across his chest, covering his once smooth skin. It spread to his stomach, arms, and even his back. His torso was now a forest of coarse hair.<br />
<br />
When he walked, he could feel the weight of his belly bouncing slightly with each step, the unfamiliar sensation of flesh jiggling and shifting on his frame. His thighs rubbed together more than before, and sitting down meant his stomach would press against his legs, pushing uncomfortably into his waistband. <br />
<br />
Juan felt a constant reminder of his new bulk with every movement. His enlarged chest, the way his moobs would press against his shirts, or the way his belly would bulge over his pants—all of it made him feel like a stranger in his own body. He was slower, more cumbersome, and everything seemed to take more effort. Walking up stairs left him winded, and he noticed himself sweating more easily, his shirt sticking to his back and chest. He hated how out of shape he felt, how everything about his new size seemed to amplify the discomfort.<br />
<br />
But despite the discomfort, something else began to stir within him, something he couldn’t quite understand. After a particularly heavy meal one evening, Juan found himself lying on the couch, his belly full and distended, feeling the weight of it pressing down as he relaxed. Pablo, ever attentive, had come to sit beside him, gently resting his hand on Juan’s belly and stroking it affectionately. Juan had expected to feel embarrassed or irritated, but instead, he felt… comforted. There was a warmth in Pablo’s touch, a sense of acceptance that made Juan feel safe. He found himself relaxing under Pablo’s hand, a quiet satisfaction spreading through him.<br />
<br />
The more Pablo touched him like this, the more Juan found himself beginning to enjoy it. The initial revulsion he felt toward his new body started to diminish, replaced by a curious acceptance. He began to see his belly as a source of warmth and comfort, a symbol of his new life with Pablo. Eating became less of a guilty pleasure and more of a simple joy. Each meal that Pablo cooked seemed to taste better than the last, and Juan found himself looking forward to the feeling of being full, of letting his body grow and change.<br />
<br />
One day, as Juan stood in front of the mirror, he caught himself admiring his reflection rather than despising it. He ran his hands over his belly, feeling the firmness of the fat beneath his skin, the way it pushed out, round and heavy. His moobs, once a source of shame, now felt like a natural part of him.</p>
