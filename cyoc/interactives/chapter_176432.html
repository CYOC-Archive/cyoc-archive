<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even with his doubts, Jay followed his new instincts. He let his hands move across Nolan. He enjoyed his shape. He enjoyed his hard muscles. In response, Nolan flexed, wanting to showcase his muscles to impress the “girl” he was dancing with. Or, it was barely a dance. More and more it turned into Jay just feeling up Nolan’s body, their bodies only vaguely following the beat of the loud music. it was less of a dance now, it was turning more into just Jay exploring Nolan’s body, their movements only vaguely following the beat of the music.<br />
<br />
As it grew hotter and heavier, Nolan laid an arm around Jay’s waist. He moved to the side and Jay let himself get swept along. Together, they left the dance floor.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Emma frantically looked around. She’d lost sight of Jay. He was there a second ago. Emma had looked away for just a moment, and that was enough. Jay was nowhere to be seen. Neither was Nolan. Emma was worried. She didn’t like this. Hopefully Maria had seen something. She turned to Maria. Her friend was chatting with some guy.<br />
<br />
“Did you see where Jaya went?” Emma tapped Maria’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Sec.” Maria excused herself to the guy she was speaking with. She turned to face Emma. “What did you say?”<br />
<br />
Emma repeated her question louder, almost yelling so she could be heard over the music.<br />
<br />
“Oh. I don’t know.” Maria shrugged. “But, if I had to guess, probably with Mr. Steroids somewhere.” Maria giggled. She then turned back to the guy she was chatting with.<br />
<br />
That was exactly what Emma was afraid of. Again she scanned the dance floor, but nothing. She tried hurrying across the room, but half-drunk half-dancing people slowed her down. She pushed her way through. How had she lost Jay? Please say he isn’t anywhere close to doing that.<br />
<br />
Somewhere else in the locale, Jay and Nolan were making out. They had found a room for themselves, giving them some privacy. Both were hot and heavy. No word had been spoken yet. The music was still loud, only slightly muffled.<br />
<br />
Away from the crowds, Jay found his thoughts becoming a little more sober again. He took in his current situation. He was alone with Nolan Baker. The implications were clear and Nolan seemed very eager. Nolan&#39;s hands touched Jay’s abdomen. His hands moved a little further down, a finger sliding underneath the skirt’s waist.<br />
<br />
“No.” Jay yelped and pushed Nolan’s hands away.<br />
<br />
After some pushing, Nolan let go.<br />
<br />
They stared at each other. Jay didn’t know how he should proceed. He couldn’t let Nolan discover what was between his legs. He couldn’t leave and stop here either. That would feel wrong. It would be incredibly unsatisfying. He couldn’t take this awkward standstill either.<br />
<br />
Jay pushed Nolan down and reached for his crotch. He unbuttoned his pants. What was he doing? Was this also a part of the supposed role he was playing? He didn’t know. At least he was in charge. His hand was gripped around Nolan’s shaft. Gently, he moved his hands. Nolan laid back docily, grunting a little as his shaft was stroked.<br />
<br />
If anything, Jay was enjoying how he’d tamed this beast of a man. Somehow, he even enjoyed having a penis in his hand. It was hard, yet it also felt almost delicate, at least in contrast to the bulky body it was attached to. Jay reached a little down. He cupped Nolan’s balls. He was a little curious. It was common that Nolan used steroids and it was also common knowledge that steroids tended to have a certain side effect. It was hard to tell without looking, but in his hands they didn’t feel too large.<br />
<br />
Looking up, Jay noticed Nolan turning a little red. Beet red in fact. Had Nolan realized that Jay was measuring his balls? Jay quickly wiped off the inquisitive expression he had on his face and moved his hands back to the shaft. He didn’t want to ruin the mood, but inside himself he was snickering a little, mostly about how the tough Nolan had such a comical insecurity.<br />
<br />
Jay continued stroking. Soon, he felt Nolan shudder. Something warm covered his hand. He pulled his hand away and got visual confirmation. His hand was covered in semen. Jay’s own penis was strained against the protection in his skirt. Why was this turning him on so much?<br />
<br />
However, he didn’t have much time to ponder. The door of their private room was ripped open.</p>
