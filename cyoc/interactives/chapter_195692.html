<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both Fran and Adam were protected by a bubble of their magic. They wouldn&#39;t catch mortal diseases and couldn&#39;t get a mortal pregnant or the other way around. This bubble protected them from the world. As Adam&#39;s mind reeled he read the potion book that had belonged to Fran&#39;s grandmother. She had left it open on the Unbirthing Solution. Adam was sick. <br />
<br />
That would explain what she had done about his chronic whoring. She had looked more pregnant than when he last saw her, like she was carrying twins. No. Impossible. She had unbirthed Jenny? That concerned him more than anything. Adam&#39;s favorite wasn&#39;t Jenny it was actually Ana. She was a true mixed race girl, part Indian and part Colombian. She stood at 5 feet 9 inches and had a curvier build than the nymph like Jenny. Her black hair was curly, showing her mixed heritage. She had the skin color like an Indian, but the hue was a shade or two lighter than a full Indian. Her breasts were bigger too, her bust was 34C. She knew growing up she was bigger than her other students.<br />
<br />
Coming out to America she had gotten part roles as an actress and model. She studied nursing but found she had more money than working as a nurse. Ana weighted 154 lbs to Jenny&#39;s 93 lb. Adam picked her when he wanted something more solid and curvy. Jenny is, was, in her early twenties. Ana was in her early thirties, same age as what Adam looked. Sex with her was a process of wearing her down, making her cum. With Jenny it was letting the nymph do her magic gymnastics and red sparrow shit they taught her from whereever she had come from. If he had to lose one, Jenny without hesitation. <br />
<br />
So before Fran came back, they essentially lived different lives, he had to protect her. <br />
<br />
Adam poured over the spell books that he had and as a man he had less options than Fran had as a bitch. Magic seemed to favor witches and bitches over him. There was only one solution he could see to protect Ana using his bubble. He would have to possess her. He preformed the spells and then sent her a message. She gave him a time and place to meet. <br />
<br />
As Adam walked into the hotel, she had used a fake name <br />
<br />
&quot;Ana?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here.&quot; she purred.<br />
<br />
He looked, she was business like. Standing on the small balcony of the hotel room. Covered in a thin drapes her body was nude. Her huge breasts sat round and full on her chest. Nipples fully erect as if the president was inspecting them. Her curly black locks were loose and she was wearing, besides a smile, black crotch-less panties. Knowing what he had to do he slipped out of his shirt and carried Ana to the bed. <br />
<br />
She had been fucked by Adam at least a dozen times. But this time was different, he was not like a man. He was machine like. His thrusts into her were constant and repetitive, She was moaning but he was making little noise, which was so unlike him. Soon he was knocking her head against the headboard. She tried to push back but his grip on her was like a boa constrictor. He was tightening his grip on her body as her nails dug into his back drawing blood. Her breasts felt like they were being squashed flat against his broad chest as he fucked her. <br />
<br />
Normally he liked it rough but it seemed like he was angry with her or someone. Her hands were pinned above her head, his grip on her wrists felt like handcuffs a former boyfriend used on her. Ana&#39;s elbows and legs were starting to get sore, she felt that her ass was being pushed into the bed so hard she could feel the springs in the mattress. Digging into the small of her back. She had to bite down on her tongue to not reveal the pain she was in. Her breasts were wobbling as much as they could against his chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Me haces daño&quot; she panted.<br />
<br />
He finally came. <br />
<br />
&quot;¡Madre de Dios!&quot; she yelled.<br />
<br />
During this time the only noise coming from Adam was the sound of his breathing.   <br />
<br />
He came inside her, but his seed was ice cold. It wasn&#39;t body or room temperature. It was cold and chilling.</p>
