<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You study the face that states back at you for quite a while, trying to understand that you were behind that face. At least it was a really good-looking one. The craziest part were the eyes. Those eyes! At first glance, you thought they were blue. But the more you look at them, they were more of a really bright hazel-green. They were such a color with so much depth, as to almost be looking like they&#39;re meant to look at the soul. You have inherited such stunning eyes. <br />
<br />
Your lips were on the plump side, especially the bottom one. With two long and wide white front teeth with a bit of a gap between them. Followed by a row of perfect-looking teeth. Unworn from age, they were still young adult teeth. <br />
<br />
The nose was a bump that rose slightly from the even-colored smooth cheeks. It was neither too wide, nor too thin. It was neither too long, nor too short. You reach up to feel that perfectly-shaped nose attached to the still-foreign face, knowing you were now the one breathing through that nose and that mouth. Possessing DNA that isn&#39;t supposed to be yours was a little bit gross. DNA you&#39;re now stuck with for the rest of your life. At least, you assume so. But at least this kid was clean and clear, though the mouth was a bit dry-tasting. It could be worse. Much worse.<br />
<br />
The hand that was feeling you&#39;re face, you take closer notice to that as you pull it away from your face. You pull your other hand up, and look at them with the rest of your smooth 12 year old boy&#39;s body in your vision. The fingers were on the long and thin side, with perfect nails. The shapes and pale coloration of the fingers you were in control of and felt through, we&#39;re equally as unbelievable. You knew you&#39;d never get used to seeing these hands anytime you would reach out to grab something. <br />
<br />
But something about being a new kid, being forced into a 12 year old body and now having to live with it, sparked your little barely-maturing penis a bit more to life. Knowing that all you are now, is just a 12 year old boy. Just a little boy that nobody, particularly real women, would take seriously. Hell, the thought of real women was starting to become a bit intimidating to you. Mostly due to the new humiliating status of your new life as just a young boy. A person still 6 years away from being legal for a woman to even be with! <br />
<br />
But the strange thing is, thinking about females has dampened the feelings of your little boy-toy. Looking back down at &quot;yourself,&quot; brought it back to life. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just a boy,&quot; you said to yourself, which brought it even further to life! The familiar feeling of male sexuality, somehow becoming less so! It was starting to be like a 12 year old beginning to &quot;discover&quot; himself for the first time! Essentially you are discovering yourself for the first time anyway. It is, after all, a completely different body. Much younger, and much more sensitive to the touch. <br />
<br />
You reach down to touch it for the first time, feeling creeped out as a man mentally in his 30s touching a 12 year old penis. But the thing is attached to you. Or rather, your brain was shoved inside this body against your wishes. But touching it, suddenly sent electricity through your brain, as the penis grew and stood in all it&#39;s long, thin, pale glory! It began to pulse, as new feelings you have never felt before began flowing through your entire body! Feelings so strong, it made you flop onto a near-by chair! Tingling exploded from every extremity of your body when you fully gripped your new equipment. It didn&#39;t take long, before you reached your absolute crescendo as fireworks of color exploded throughout every region of your brain for several long pumps you weren&#39;t sure would ever end! But eventually it does, and your left sitting in this chair, panting. <br />
<br />
A rising fear began to well up. What was THAT!? said an unbidden inner voice. &quot;What just happened to me!?&quot; <br />
<br />
Of course, you knew perfectly well what it was....didn&#39;t you? You look down and see that your dick had squirted out a bunch of slimy white stuff! &quot;Sperm,&quot; you think. &quot;Is THAT what that looks like?&quot; You knew from your classmates talking about it that&#39;s what it was....<br />
<br />
Wait! Classmates? You start to become foggy about who you are. Or rather, were. Your not a 12 year old kid with &quot;classmates!&quot; You&#39;re a grown ass man! You get up off the seat, and clean yourself up. Still buzzing from your very first-time experience. Knowing full well it wasn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
Getting sick of looking at your new pathetic little boy&#39;s body, you finally decide to at least get dressed. You look at the pile of clothes. A navy blue T-shirt with a gray Nike swoosh. A small brownish-cream-colored zip-up hoodie. Light gray colored And 1 shorts. Nike socks, and Nike shoes. <br />
<br />
Nikes. You could never wear Nikes in your old body. They were built for narrower feet, so you were always stuck with something like New balance, Sketchers, and Merrill&#39;s. Looking at the feet attached to you, they are small. <br />
<br />
Sighing, you pull the brifs up, which hug your waist perfectly. Even highlighting you now have a perfect little small bubble-butt. Your penis small enough to barely be noticeable as a little bump on the front. You can&#39;t help but be attracted to this, which was just weird. <br />
<br />
Shaking your head and sighing, you pull on the shorts, leaving you thin, but slightly youthfully muscled legs sticking out for the entire world to see you have no body hair yet. Finally, on goes the shirt, then the hoodie you were sure wasn&#39;t going to fit, but you wind up not-quite swimming in! You have to get used to the fact that you are now a lot smaller than you used to be. That your new body will easily fit inside small clothing.</p>
