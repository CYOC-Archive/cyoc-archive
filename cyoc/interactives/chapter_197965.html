<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were going to try it on your little brother, but you were worried about the consequences of being caught as your little brother. With two of him. How would that be explained away? <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; you think, as the idea of &quot;horse shoes&quot; slips into your mind. Horseshoes? Well, there is a donkey farm just down the road from where you live. Surely, they hammer on those metal horseshoes to donkey hooves as well....<br />
<br />
Donkey shoes. The idea of wearing donkey shoes. It sparks your interest. If it works, you not only get to experience your secret dark wishes to see what it would be like to be a donkey for a little while. But you needn&#39;t have to explain anything if anyone sees you. After all, you&#39;d just be an ordinary-looking donkey instead of a duplicate of an individual human, which would be much harder to explain away if caught.<br />
<br />
You decide to go for it. Grabbing your keys, you hop in your car and take a drive about 10 miles down the road to the donkey farm. Parking your car in an inconspicuous location among a bunch of trees, you make your way onto the private property towards the barn, magic socks in hand. <br />
<br />
Trespassing, you sneak into the empty stables and begin searching around. There in a corner, are a pile of old used horseshoes. You examine the pile, and pull out a set of four of the heavy metal shoes. You examine them. <br />
<br />
&quot;If this works, I&#39;ll be eligible to be wearing these things,&quot; you think to yourself, which excites you. <br />
<br />
You set out four shoes on the floor of the barn in such a way where you will be able to place each of your four soon-to-be legs onto them. You stand back up after placing the last one, and begin to take off your own human shoes and socks. You then slip the magic socks onto your feet, but notice you&#39;re still wearing your clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Donkeys don&#39;t wear clothes,&quot; you think to yourself. &quot;Besides, they&#39;re a lot larger in mass than me. I don&#39;t want to ruin my clothes when I change back....&quot;<br />
<br />
So you begin to strip down to your birthday suit, with the exception of the magic socks. As you do, you hear someone call out;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh!&quot; you say, as you quickly step upon the two &quot;hind&quot; horseshoes while you tossed your clothes aside into a dark corner. The moment you step on the rearward horseshoes, you immediately feel vertigo! The world seems to move sort of in an upward direction, and your stomach felt queasy. You put your hands out to catch yourself. You feel like you&#39;re falling. As you do, you land on your &quot;hands&quot; with two loud &quot;CLOPs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said who&#39;s there!?&quot; you hear the voice much louder and clearer than before. &quot;You better come on out! I have a shot gun! I know you&#39;re in there!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee haaww!&quot; you surprisingly bray, as you attempt to tell him not to shoot! That&#39;s when you take a look around, and notice a large gray-furred body behind you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee haaaww,&quot; you bray again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. Oh...&quot; You think, as you realized the socks actually seemed to have worked! And they worked much quicker than you expected! You were deprived of an actual transformation, where you got to feel yourself growing in bulk, your hands and feet cramping up into hooves, hide and fur covering your body, and your face and skull stretching out. Instead, it was more of a less satisfying &quot;BAM! You&#39;re now a donkey!&quot; But in a way, the unexpected suddenness made you a bit horny to find yourself suddenly and without warning, as a full-bred donkey. You haven&#39;t had time for it to sink in and think about it beyond the simplest of fact: you are now a donkey.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in tarnation is one of my donkeys doing in the barn...&quot; you hear the same voice mutter as he threw open the door. There, he found one of his donkeys, Jeb, standing inside the stable looking back at itself in a goofy manner. Or at least, what appeared to be Jeb to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, what in tarnation are you doing in here Jeb?&quot; he asked you. <br />
<br />
Your only possible response is &quot;heeee hhaawww..&quot; You are unable to speak, as you&#39;ve been turned into a large male jackass named Jeb! Or at least, an exact copy of Jeb. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re supposed to be in the field grazing,&quot; he said, as he quickly draped an extra bridle that was laying around, onto your elongated skull. He did this with a skilled, practiced hand and while you were still confusedly trying to grasp your new situation. <br />
 <br />
The farmer managed to tighten the straps of your new bridle, and slid the bit into your mouth. This sure was not very comfortable, and you bray in protest to attempt to make known your displeasure at being treated like a common animal, still not sinking in yet that you&#39;ve suddenly changed species <br />
<br />
With practiced yanks, the farmer apparently has control over you with the bridle and reigns! He&#39;s used to dealing with stubborn jackasses like you and your new twin brother, Jeb. With dull clippety-clops, he forcefully led you out of the stable and towards the fields. <br />
<br />
At the last second, however, he noticed several things:<br />
<br />
1) That you didn&#39;t have any horseshoes attached to your hooves. <br />
<br />
2) That there was a pair of socks around your hind hooves.<br />
<br />
3) And finally, he noticed your pile of clothes in a dark recessed corner where you flung them. <br />
<br />
&quot;What in tarnation is going on around here?&quot; he said mostly to himself, not expecting a dim-witted donkey like you to understand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s clothes are these?&quot; He asked, walking over, bending down, and picking them up. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll just throw them in this trash bag. Maybe used them as rags later on...&quot; He muttered.<br />
<br />
Alarmed, you attempted to speak in protest about the plan of turning your perfectly good clothes into a bunch of rags for a dirty old farmer. But with the vocal configurations of a donkey, no words could escape your thick black lips. &quot;Heeee hhaawww!&quot; Is all you managed....<br />
<br />
&quot;As for you,&quot; continued the farmer, &quot;who put a couple of socks on you, and why are you not shoed!?&quot; <br />
<br />
At this point, your magic socks are mostly coming off your hooves, as they were never designed for the feet of a donkey. They were too ill-fitting. With a quick yank, the farmer managed to remove them clear of your hind hooves. <br />
<br />
Alarmed at this deteriorating turn of events, you attempt to protest again....<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaawww hhheee hhaawww!&quot; <br />
<br />
Grabbing onto to reigns again, the farmer once again took control over your body. He managed to forced you towards a work bench where he grabbed his tools to set about the task of solidly nailing brand new horseshoes to your hooves. <br />
<br />
Again, the farmer is practiced with dealing with stubborn farm animals. Without being too wordy, he manages to get you to lift your left hind leg. He began to sink the first nail into your hoof, firmly attaching the horseshoe. <br />
<br />
During this time, you hardly ever managed to collect your thoughts, which seemed somewhat sluggish. By the time the farmer got the second horseshoe in place, it finally began to cross your mind:<br />
<br />
How were you ever going to be able to remove these horseshoes, put on those magic socks, and put on your regular shoes and change back to your former self!?<br />
<br />
As you were pondering this, the farmer was working quickly. One by one, he managed to nail horseshoes to all four of your hooves! With the final nail in your front right hoof, you set it down with a sharp &quot;clack!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaawww,&quot; you say again unintelligibly. You feel your new giant member between your hind legs begin to grow hard, which you&#39;ve noticed for the first time. The farmer grabs your reigns firmly in hand and roughly tugs on it, forcing you to move forward. You try to resist the urge to follow his directions, but he only tugs on it the harder. You end up being forced to obey. <br />
<br />
All you can do with this sort of odd discomfort emanating from your mouth, is huff in an equine fashion and obey his every command as your new master. You feel your donkey penis, which must be enormous, wobbling and swaying as you walk. It continues to fill with blood. By the time you reach the open field through the electrified gate, you&#39;ve become 3/4 hard and your male jackass horniness beginning to reach new heights. <br />
<br />
Once inside the field surrounded by barbed wire and electric fencing, the farmer relieves you of your infernal bit and bridle. He makes his way back to the gate, and you bray at his back with yet another futile attempt at speaking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! You can&#39;t leave me here!&quot; was your thoughts. &quot;Heee haaww heee hhaawww heee haaaww!&quot; Is all you&#39;re able to manage. <br />
<br />
Your sharpened equine hearing detects the crackling noise of electricity, and you feel your gray fur-covered hide getting all prickly just being near that fence. Since Jeb the real donkey is terrified of the fence, and since you are now essentially him in body and hormones, you feel spooked. You try approaching that crackling gate and follow him, even as the farmer continues walking away, but your body refuses the command. You actually mentally feel the fear, and back away. You make an attempt at approaching the gate again, but your fear only grows! You get that queasy feeling in your stomach and soles of your feet that you always got when confronted with heights as a human. Only it&#39;s a silly little gate that&#39;s making you feel this way!<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, it&#39;s only a gate,&quot; you tell yourself. You make the attempt to approach it again, but your body again refuses to comply with more than a stomp of your shoe-clad right hoof on the mud and grass beneath your feet. The fear of that electricity grows to new heights, and you end up backing further away, to what your body tells you is a &quot;safe&quot; distance. From there, you find you can get no closer. <br />
<br />
Out of frustration, you stand there braying after the farmer who is now just a dark shadow in the distance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaawww heee hhaawww heee hhaawww Heee hhaawww heee hhaawww heee hhaawww Heee hhaawww heee hhaawww heee hhaawww Heee hhaawww heee hhaawww heee hhaawww Heee hhaawww heee hhaawww heee hhaawww,&quot; etc. <br />
<br />
All you can do, is stand there on all fours braying into the empty wind.</p>
