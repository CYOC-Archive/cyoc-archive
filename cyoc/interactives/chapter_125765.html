<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A deep moan woke Joan the next day. Her voice sounded funny to her, like she had a cold. Not wanting to wake Vanessa, she tiptoed into the bathroom, locking the door gently behind her, and stared wide-eyed into the mirror.<br />
<br />
Overnight, some of the hair had grown back. The dark hair that enveloped her lower body stared back at her, mocking her feminine features in a grotesque way. The stubble on her face had grown back somewhat, though it didn&#39;t look as strange and out-of-place without her makeup on.<br />
<br />
She decided that she would shave only the parts of her body that would be visible after she got dressed - namely her face, and went downstairs to find Vanessa cooking breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;It didn&#39;t grow back!&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just shaved,&quot; Joan replied, graciously accepting the eggs and bacon Vanessa had cooked for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Vanessa said, slightly disappointed. &quot;Do you have a cold?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might be getting one,&quot; Joan replied, although she didn&#39;t feel any sickness at all. Her throat wasn&#39;t sore, either; she just sounded like it was.<br />
<br />
As the two of them ate, Joan&#39;s pants began to feel tight. She was constantly trying to subtly adjust them, but Vanessa&#39;s overprotective eyes caught on right away.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got a wedgie?&quot; she jokingly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like I ate a ton!&quot; Joan replied. &quot;My pants don&#39;t fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After breakfast change them.&quot;<br />
<br />
But the sensation got worse as they ate, and even more uncomfortable was the feeling in her crotch. She felt like she sitting on something.<br />
<br />
The meal ended and Joan helped Vanessa clean up and do dishes. She wanted to change her pants, but didn&#39;t want Vanessa to know how painful they had become. She was thankful that her shirt hung down to her wide hips because the button of her jeans came undone as she moved about.<br />
<br />
Joan and Vanessa commenced to raiding her parents&#39; closet, searching for a larger pair of pants. Joan&#39;s were feeling unbearably tight, and her bra was starting to feel loose on her chest.<br />
<br />
She was thankful when the phone rang so she could be alone for a few minutes. Almost immediatey after Vanessa left, she pulled down her pants for a few moments of relief. Her stomach was definately bigger, but it wasn&#39;t fat. She had six-pack abs, all right, but they looked like a man&#39;s. Her panic grew even more intense when she noticed the bulge in her panties. That&#39;s what made the crotch area feel so tight!<br />
<br />
Holding her breath, she allowed her panties to join her pants at her ankles and gasped in shock. Her clitrotis had grown almost an inch long! She wondered if she was becoming a man.<br />
<br />
Feeling sick at what she was seeing, she quickly pulled up her pants and panties, however uncomfortable they were, just in time for Vanessa to return.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was your mom,&quot; she said. &quot;She and Todd are searching for that stupid ray gun. Apparently he lost it on the way back to your house. She said for you to stay here until they find it.&quot; It was then that she noticed Joan looking rather pale. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m disgusting,&quot; Joan remarked, her voice choked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re disgusting,&quot; Vanessa consoled.<br />
<br />
Joan quickly explained what had happened while Vanessa was on the phone. Vanessa looked shocked for a moment, but then regained her composure, cool-headed as always.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it won&#39;t be forever,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What will Jared think?&quot; Joan asked, succumbing to her own feelings of despair, panic, and disgust. He would leave her if he knew she was slowly turning into a man.<br />
<br />
&quot;He won&#39;t have to know,&quot; Vanessa repied. &quot;You&#39;ll be here, and it won&#39;t be long before you&#39;re yourself again.&quot;<br />
<br />
She wrapped her arms around Joan, allowing her to rest against her and release all that she had kept bottled up.<br />
<br />
As Joan sobbed, she began wondering what would come. Her voice would progressively get deeper, she figured. That was a no-brainer. She&#39;d also probably get larger hands and feet, and maybe a little taller. She hated her body and what it was going through. It was so painful and hard to adjust to.<br />
<br />
Joan continued to sob into her friend&#39;s shoulder, suddenly realizing how amazingly gentle Vanessa was. Her back was being stroked in a very motherly sort of way, which was very unusual for Vanessa. Vanessa was very good about sucking things up, and she typically expected the same of others, but not now.<br />
<br />
Joan&#39;s mind was suddenly brought back to the uncomfortable feeling around her waste. Hastily wiping her eyes, she immediately grabbed a pair of jeans that belonged to Vanessa&#39;s father. He wasn&#39;t a fat man, but his waste was definately larger and bit flabbier than Joan&#39;s, so a belt was in order. Vanessa, realizing what it was her friend was searching for, ran to a large chest of drawers and retrieved a pair of red boxers and a large black belt with the image of an eagle on it. It was her dad&#39;s favorite, but he hadn&#39;t worn it in quite a while.<br />
<br />
Joan turned her back to Vanessa, who politely looked away as Joan changed into the new garments. The legs on the pants were a bit too long, but Joan expected that she might grow into them. At any rate, they were much, much more comfortable than her own figure-hugging pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feeling better?&quot; Vanessa asked. Joan shook her head as her friend looked her over. Vanessa was trying to figure how much more Joan would change and if she would change back to female at the same slow rate once the ray gun had been found. <br />
<br />
The girls needed to find something to do that was fun.</p>
