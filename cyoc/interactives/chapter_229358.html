<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Rebecca put on a bigger fake smile, but internally cringed as she had to wrap her other arm around Rosita. She wiggled uncomfortably in place, feeling that her former lover unknowingly transformed into panties were giving her a wedgie. The four former college men turned older women gave big grins.<br />
&quot;Say cheese!&quot; Jennifer added, just before reality itself was about to be altered.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
Just like that, reality had altered once again. In an instant, a photo popped out, and they had transformed. The mode that Rebecca had accidentally flipped on was reverse blend. Since there was nothing visible in the photo besides the subjects, they were reverse blended with one another.<br />
<br />
The four women in the photo were all older, with the oldest reaching near middle-aged, so they all were to get younger. Ironically, they would end up back as college students, though with a different school. Instead of the nice hometown university, they were attending the cheap, worn down community college, as their nicer lives turned to trashy. <br />
<br />
Where Rebecca had stood, there were now two women, as Emily had been returned to human form.... well, a form not so much her form. <br />
<br />
The red head was youthful again, about 22, but that was about the only plus to her change. Her hair was longer, but instead of curled from carefully applied conditioner it was unkept, only held back by a scrunchie, and was much more frizzy than curly. Her face had minimal makeup, and she had no earrings or other jewelry to speak of. Getting younger meant her tits got larger, and there was no bra in sight as they hung loosely down, only supported by her white tank top. Her fat ass and long legs were no longer supported by jeans, but a blue pair of sweatpants with cookie monster&#39;s face on her ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah... like, why do I feel funny?&quot; She gawked, putting her hand on her head. &quot;You okay Ellie?&quot; <br />
<br />
Emily, or rather, Ellie, had also changed drastically. The formerly brunette woman now had blonde hair, although it was obviously fake in color and doubly fake as her brown roots were plainly visible. Unlike her former boyfriend, she was wearing underwear, though it was partially visible through her dark, thin fabric draped over her shoulders looking more like a poncho that a shirt. She pulled up at her jean shorts, ironically feeling uncomfortable in her new panties, then turned to face the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, I guess or whatever.&quot; She muttered, rubbing her own forehead.&quot;What were we doing again Reagan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beats me... Oh wait, something with that camera yeah?&quot; Rebecca, now Reagan, added, pointing at the camera which laid on their table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh!&quot; Someone said behind the two, startling them both. &quot;We all decided to take a pic together, how&#39;d you forget you dumb bimbos?&quot; The woman laughed aloud.<br />
<br />
Both ladies turned to see three other women standing adjacent to them. Due to their closer proximity, however, they had also reverse-blended with one another, leaving each of them with exchanged races as well as lifestyle. Instead of the sure of herself, blonde head of the trio, Jennifer was the youngest. She was a young, and also Hispanic, gaining Rosita&#39;s race.<br />
<br />
Instead of just descending from Latinos, however, this new woman was an illegal immigrant who came to the United States with her family when she was in her early teens. She still had an accent, came from a rougher neighborhood, and always bends her will to others to better fit in with her friends or. She had curly, jet black hair down to her shoulders, decent breasts and a huge ass giving her a pear shape, and wore a cheap college hoodie and pair of sweatpants she got for a bargain at the community college store.<br />
<br />
Beside her was the former Keiko, now the white girl of the trio. She still had jet black hair, though longer and greasier than before Her genetics gave her larger breasts, but stole from her behind in return. Despite the lack of makeup, her face was gorgeous, though ruined by her conniving scowl as she glared down Reagan and Ellie. She had clearly taken over as head of the group, going from the calm and modest Keiko to a rude, stuck up white hoe.<br />
<br />
Finally there was the former Rosita, now Asian. The color of her skin had paled, losing any shade of caramel she once had for a practically shiny white. Though instead of a lovely glow, it was more than likely a glow caused by too much zit removal cream. She was also the only one of the 5 to have gained wait from her de-aging. Apparently, the seemingly flawless Rosita had been a chubby youth, and changing backgrounds and race was not enough to change that fact.<br />
<br />
It was now this larger woman who would address the other two now, as she snickered upon seeing their confusion.<br />
&quot;Oh my god didja like, forget already or whatever?&quot; She asked with a sneer. &quot;How dumb can ya be right, Kim?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-si, chess, it is so e-stupid! It is very dumb!&quot; The newly demoted member of the trio tacked on to feel included.<br />
<br />
The new head bitch Kim just rolled her eyes and turned around to demean her crew. What professional and friendly respect they all had ahd been magically reversed, all of them being held together by pettiness and insecurity.<br />
&quot;Ugh, shuddup Rei, you too Josie.&quot; She chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-it&#39;s Juanita.&quot; Juanita whispered, barely audible for herself to even hear, let alone her &#39;friends&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, whose is you callin&#39; a whore, slut?&quot; Reagan scoffed, approaching Kim rapidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wow lookit, Reagan the school sex toy isn&#39;t wearing a bra, shocker.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I only slept with like 3 guys and they all wore protection! Like you&#39;d know about that Ms. &quot;O.M.G. its the football team&quot; Smith!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellie watched as Reagan started to fight with Kim, but she wasn&#39;t really paying attention. She felt... weird. As if, something wasn&#39;t right. Yet, at the same time, she felt some kind of relief? Just the feeling of being able to move her arm made her feel calmer... but why? She glanced over at their table, scattered in the food they had sloppily eaten, and at the center, that old Polaroid camera. Something about it seemed, familiar to her, but she couldn&#39;t quite place it.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Ellie&#39;s train of thought was thrown off track as the local bitchy security guard was walking towards the group with conviction. The graying hag always screamed the girls out of the mall, often threatening to call the school to get them thrown out, and telling them nasty things like if they kept up this lifestyle they&#39;d end up as hookers or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;G-guys, uggo-prime at like 5 o&#39;clock.&quot; She called out, just loud enough for the girls to hear, but not too loud as to alert anyone nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, that&#39;s like, 9 o&#39;clock, but thanks Ellie the idiot.&quot; Kim scoffed, also completely wrong about which direction the guard was walking from. &quot;God why am I even talking to you two sluts anyway?&quot; She hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably to finish are damn photography project so we aren&#39;t expelled.&quot; Reagan scoffed, her mind being suddenly filled with new memories from this warped reality. &quot;Just grab your shit and scatter. We&#39;ll all meet back at Spanish girl&#39;s place later. It&#39;s farthest from this shithole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her name is Jane, but sure, whatever creep. The Sooner I&#39;m free of you, the better.&quot; Kim huffed, not even hearing Juanita&#39;s meek &quot;It&#39;s not.&quot; as everyone scrambled together their things. <br />
<br />
Just as the guard ran over, yelling out &quot;Hey!&quot; All 5 girls ran off in different directions, only garbage being left behind as all their purses, phones and extra clothing got taken away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, hey, janitor in Food Court East please.&quot; The guard muttered into her walkie-talkie. She lowered it, then muttered something about &quot;dumb hoes&quot; as she looked over the mess they left.<br />
<br />
Of course, as the girls all scattered, there was only one question that mattered. Who had the camera?</p>
