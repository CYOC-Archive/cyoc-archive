<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh God!&quot; Jeffery moaned loudly. He threw his head back as Nicholas&#39;s dick pushed inside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;C-careful, babe,&quot; Nicholas huffed. He rubbed his lower equine half along the top of Jeffery&#39;s. &quot;We don&#39;t want the whole neighborhood to hear us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; Jeffery cried in ecstasy. &quot;I&#39;ve never wanted you to fuck me so hard right now! It feels like we&#39;ve never done this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicholas huffed even louder as he pulled his upper body up against his husband&#39;s. He couldn&#39;t agree more with Jeffery. His lover&#39;s pussy felt so tight and comfortable at the same time. He began thrusting in and out. The intense pleasure coursed over his body, and he gripped Jeffery&#39;s chest tightly. He knew how Jeffery liked to be held when they fucked. Both of them had been going at it for close to an hour now. Their lust and horniness for each other hadn&#39;t died down yet. They were certain that the Chronivac had given them significant boosts in that department. But they interestingly hadn&#39;t been able to cum yet. But their arousal rose higher and higher with each passing breath. They felt that they had left the point of no return at least a half an hour ago. The pleasure was more intense than even their honeymoon night. However, Nicholas began to feel the pleasure begin to rise at a much faster rate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think,&quot; he panted and gasped. &quot;I think I&#39;m going to...&quot; He trailed off as the pleasure began to build. He could feel the powerful orgasm approaching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me t-t-too,&quot; Jeffery stuttered. He was breathing in shorter breaths now. He latched onto Nicholas&#39;s hands tightly. Nicholas pulled Jeffery&#39;s torso back. They pressed their upper bodies together tightly. Nicholas stuck his tongue into Jeffery&#39;s mouth. He closed his eyes tightly for a moment as they kissed. He felt his cock lurch forward inside Jeffery as the orgasm began to overtake him. This was his favorite part.<br />
<br />
Back in the bedroom, the Chronivac timer chimed. Nick&#39;s eyes shot open. He pulled his mouth off of Jesse&#39;s. They both stared at each other in disbelief. But despite their abject horror of the realization of what they had been doing together, their bodies were still reacting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh, OH, FUCK!&quot; Nick yelled. He orgasmed harder than he had ever had before. His dick spasmed crazily inside Jesse&#39;s pussy. The pleasure coursed over his entire centaur body. He involuntarily gripped Jesse&#39;s muscle-bound chest harder. That seemed to also push Jesse over the edge. His pussy clenched tightly on Nick&#39;s dick, and Jesse released a very lust-filled moan. They stayed like that for what felt like hours, but was really only minutes.<br />
<br />
Once his breathing had settled down, Nick only said, &quot;Wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jesse said. &quot;That was...something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No kidding,&quot; Nick said. He began to slide off of Jesse&#39;s horse half. Jesse bit his bottom lip as Nick&#39;s dick slid out of his dripping pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we were wrong about what that thing did to us,&quot; Jesse mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think?&quot; Nick asked incredulously. He stared at Jesse&#39;s body. Even though he had just come down off an orgasm, he still felt a slight stirring in his crotch as he looked at the centaur body before him. He absentmindedly fidgeted with the wedding ring on his left hand. He suddenly brought his hand up to his face. The realization sunk in: he was married to his roommate and best friend. Yet, the memories of dating Jeffery, no, Jesse flitted in and out of his mind. He felt a subconscious urge to grab hold of Jesse&#39;s body tightly. It was what he did whenever he got uneasy about stuff. Holding onto his husband calmed him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Nick mumbled. Jeffery, no, Jesse was NOT his husband. He was NOT married. He huffed and walked away from Jesse. He entered the bedroom where that stupid computer sat. There was also a full-length mirror on the far end of the room. He decided to look at his body.<br />
<br />
He had to admit that he liked the feel of these massive muscles. He quickly went into a double bicep flex pose. His arms popped impressively. Even his lower equine half of his body looked fit and muscular. Lifting heavy objects did not seem like it would be a problem to him. He had to admit that he did like how he looked, despite obviously having become a new species. He heard steps behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick?&quot; Jesse asked hesitantly. &quot;You okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick whirled around as best he could. &quot;Am I okay?! What do you think?!&quot; He was upset, and his face showed it. But then he saw Jesse&#39;s face. He was worried and clearly shaken up by what had happened to him. Nick&#39;s anger dissipated almost completely. &quot;Oh. Jesse, I...um...I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Jesse&#39;s worry did not seem to ease up. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have barked at you. You got it worse than I did.&quot; He took a deep breath. He immediately regretted it. Jesse was still in heat, and his scent was beginning to fill the room. Nick&#39;s dick began to respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to change back?&quot; Nick asked, trying to ignore his thick erection. Jesse walked slowly closer to Nick. They stared at each other, eye-to-eye, for a few minutes. Neither said a word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you?&quot; Jesse asked. Nick frowned at his husband. NO! His friend. Jesse explained, &quot;I mean, it wasn&#39;t like I didn&#39;t enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick grabbed Jesse tenderly on the shoulders. &quot;But it&#39;s because of the Chronivac. You and I are married because of a machine. Even though we have memories of falling in love and our first date and...&quot; He trailed off. He realized that, just because he knew that those memories weren&#39;t real didn&#39;t mean they couldn&#39;t be.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, Nick,&quot; Jesse said. &quot;I just...I still love you, even though I know all of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Nick said, pulling Jesse in for a hug. &quot;But we have to remember it&#39;s not real. What we feel for each other isn&#39;t real.&quot; Jesse nodded, but they didn&#39;t let go of each other. &quot;We have to decide what we do going forward: do we change back to normal or do we remain as we are now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can...can we wait just a few minutes before we decide?&quot; Jesse whispered. &quot;I&#39;m not ready to let this go just yet.&quot; Nick smiled and held him a little tighter. They stepped back after several minutes and stared at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what we should do,&quot; Jesse said firmly. He squeezed Nick&#39;s hand hard. Nick felt that regardless of the choice, a part of him would not like it either way.</p>
