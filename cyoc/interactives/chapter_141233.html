<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two hunks laid on the cool tiles of the lab for some moments, a stream of the Bull&#39;s semen oozing out of Hank&#39;s used hole. The two of them smiled at each other, thankful that destiny had brought them together. In Tyler&#39;s mind though, he wondered if it was Madame Illusia&#39;s doing.<br />
<br />
The hulking, massive football player leans his colossal back against a lab bench and tells the stud before him the tale of how he came to be in the possession of a pair of giant bull balls and a tapered-tip bull cock that smacked him right between his hairy pecs that jutted several inches from his ribcage. Hank raised a brow, having heard of the show from among the hushed whispers at the gay club. For some reason only the gay men in town seemed to know about it. He never thought something like this could happen to anyone!<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s some sort of illusion right, Madame &#39;Illusia&#39; and all that?&quot; Hank chuckled nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does this look fake to you?&quot; Tyler grunted in frustration. He held his now flaccid bull cock, the pink and black splotched member dangling limply across his thunderous, hairy thigh. He slowly began to stuff it back into its sheath, shudder as the leftover cum oozes out of the slit that sat just below his navel. He could already feel his balls begin to get to work at refilling and he knew he&#39;d need Hank again today so he&#39;d best keep him close. &quot;Did it feel fake?&quot; he coos sultrily. Hank&#39;s handsome visage flushes red at the remark. &quot;Does this feel fake too?&quot; he adds, bringing up an impossibly huge and vein-ridden arm, blasting blood into his 25&quot; bicep for Hank to play with. He moans, almost sounding like a bull as Hank&#39;s hands roam against his grandiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, point taken,&quot; Hank guffawed. &quot;Well, I&#39;m kinda busy with school, but, how about this weekend, we go on a date to the show?&quot; Tyler nods, he could live as a freak for the time being. Hank leans forward and gives Tyler a peck on the cheek, his lips brushing against the stubble. He stands and begins to put his clothes on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Tyler demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve already missed one class, man,&quot; Hank scowled. &quot;I&#39;ll see you later.&quot; Hank saw the worried, almost panicked expression, so out of place on his hypermasculine face. Hank&#39;s gaze softens and he sighs, &quot;I really mean it, Ty.&quot; He leans down as he pulls up his jeans, planting a quick kiss on the musclefreak&#39;s forehead. &quot;You workout at the gym after 5, right?&quot; Hank asked, buttoning up his shirt. Tyler nods and the two of them smile. It&#39;s a date.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Tyler rocked back and forth in the student center, the booths to his side empty as the other students gave the beast wide berth. He was anxiously waiting, looking at the clock to strike 5 so he could go and meet his &#39;one.&#39; His balls had already started to ache, but nothing like before. He couldn&#39;t wait to beast through another workout and show Hank what a real bull looks like as he pushed, pulled and hauled ass in the gym, a real beast of burden. He wanted to see Hank&#39;s handsome face light up as he presented his swollen physique to him and then, he&#39;d take Hank back to his dorm, the two of them horned up and they&#39;d fuck all night long.<br />
<br />
Tyler fished his hand into his oversized shorts, still barely able to handle his package. He massaged his hungry nuts, desperate for release. The Bull smirked, this time his curse was a blessing, he was fantasizing about the hottest piece of ass on campus and he didn&#39;t have to be embarrassed about sporting serious wood!<br />
<br />
Testosterone coursed through his veins, the beast licking his lips as the digital clock switched over to 5:00, his eyes seeing red digits, his inner bull enraged. He picked up his gym bag and stormed his way to the campus gym. Everyone stared at him in the locker room. It was the first time they&#39;d ever seen the Bull completely naked. His black sheath and balls on full display. &#39;Jesus, I thought it was pubes,&#39; one guy said. &#39;It&#39;s plastic surgery, right? No way that&#39;s natural,&#39; another remarked. &#39;Is it like those guys that inject saline and silicone into their nuts?!&#39; another one blurted loudly to his workout partner.<br />
<br />
&#39;Let them stare,&#39; the Bull thought to himself. He wanted to see the surprise on his partner&#39;s face. He waited around for a few minutes, his heavy balls and sheath sticking out in the air all the while, drawing the eyes of every shocked passerby.<br />
<br />
&#39;Where are you?&#39; he texted Hank.<br />
<br />
&#39;Working out already, get in here,&#39; was the response.<br />
<br />
The Bull&#39;s nostrils flared as he pulled up his workout shorts. He didn&#39;t bother put on a shirt, no longer embarrassed of his condition. The tip of his sheath poked out from the band of his shorts, but Tyler was banking on everyone else being awed by his enormous musculature, his hirsute muscles being the star of the show. Whether that worked or not, he couldn&#39;t tell, but people actively avoided running into him regardless.<br />
<br />
As he entered the gym floor, he spotted Hank almost immediately. He felt his loins begin to stir and his balls began to ache hungrily. But he did his best to put it out of mind. The hunky rugby player was working out with a ferocity he had never seen in anyone, anyone but himself. Despite it being incredibly busy at the campus gym, Hank had dumbbells and even barbells scattered around his bench. He drew plenty of annoyed looks but no one seemed to dare to interrupt him.<br />
<br />
The hunk&#39;s skin was almost tomato red, so flushed with blood. Every muscle on his body was pumped, almost freakishly so. His concentration was absolute, he paid no heed to the stares of disgust, envy and lust from the other gym-goers. Tyler couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing and somehow, he just knew it was because of the inordinate amount of bull-seed he had implanted into Hank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Tyler grunted as he approached the frenzied stud. Hank growled and racked the barbell, sitting up, a goofy grin plastered to his face. Tyler helped Hank to his feet, astonished at how strong Hank&#39;s grip was, even though he was wobbly, exhausted from pumping his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey yourself, handsome,&quot; Hank replied with a wink, breathing heavily. His a-shirt was practically see-through, his nipples tantalizingly hard, almost calling for Tyler to suck them. &quot;Sorry, I should&#39;ve told you to come earlier. I just got this feeling halfway through my day, like some sort of wild animal running through my veins. Needed to get it out,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;And, ooooh,&quot; he moaned, lost in the pleasure of his own muscles, throwing down his arms, his shirt protesting as his pumped muscles filled it to the brim. A clear imprint of his healthy-sized cock throbbed in his shorts. &quot;I know it&#39;s probably the pump, but I feel like I&#39;m inches bigger everywhere...&quot; He looked down to his obscene basket. &quot;Maybe everywhere everywhere, if you know what I mean,&quot; he added lewdly, cocking his brow at Tyler.<br />
<br />
Tyler&#39;s blood quickened, his pulse causing his veins to twitch as he spotted for Hank. He swore he could see the hunk&#39;s shirt ride up more on his traps, as if he was growing. He didn&#39;t know if he was imagining it or not, but he thought Hank&#39;s voice seemed deeper.<br />
<br />
Testosterone seeped into his system, jazzing him up and sending him into an androgen-fueled iron-rage. Hank pulled the Bull over to a corner for him to workout. As Tyler snorted, grunted and beasted through his sets, Hank stood guard, making sure people didn&#39;t see the massive cock pushing into the hairy musclefreak&#39;s pectorals as he blasted his chest, shoulder, arms and back.<br />
<br />
The two hunks waddled their way back to the lockers, after waiting a good half hour for Tyler to calm down enough to but his &#39;little&#39; Bull back into his sheath. Both of them felt like they had gotten the best pumps of their lives. They both had the same idea, shower and dress quickly, their clothes damp from not toweling off completely. But as their clothes clung to their pumped physiques, and their erections distending their clothes -- Hank his left leg&#39;s sleeve and Tyler his skin-tight button up shirt.<br />
<br />
The moment they got into Tyler&#39;s dorm room, Hank yelped as Tyler moaned, flexing his giant penis. Buttons scattered across the room as Tyler&#39;s hairy chest exploded out of his shirt, the pre-soaked tip of his bull-cock working its way down, shredding the buttons of his shirt right off.<br />
<br />
Hank attempted to pull his shirt off, only to find his pump was so extreme he couldn&#39;t get his arms over his head. Rather than waste any more time, he pulled at the collar of his t-shirt and ripped it right off.<br />
<br />
Their mouths collided as they rolled in Tyler&#39;s sheets, their hands feeling each others brawn, their partner&#39;s incredible strength and size. Their cocks oozed pre in between abs and Tyler could take no more. Wordlessly he mounted Hank on his giant penis and shamelessly, Hank pushed himself down to Tyler&#39;s base.<br />
<br />
Tyler&#39;s neighbors had to put their headphones on that night, the sound of two animals in a barnyard going at it rang through the walls until the wee hours.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Tyler yawned as he finally awoke, the first night where his sleep wasn&#39;t listless, his balls satisfied for once. He moves his hand and feels up the man in front of him, his prized possession, his &#39;one.&#39; But... something felt different from last night, his eyes opened wide and his sleepiness dissipated as he looked at Hank...</p>
