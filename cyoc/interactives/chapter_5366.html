<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mac Blocker didn’t have time for what was happening to him, but he couldn’t stop it either.  He needed to escape, but his orgasm was beginning to build again.  He was security chief of this damned place, did Rothman really think he could stop him by locking him up.<br />
<br />
He looked down, something was happening to his cock, it was changing shape.  His balls had already become huge and hung low and had a fuzzy grey covering of fur.  Fur was growing all over his body, he watched, half fascinated and half horrified as his red human hair began to disappear beneath the tan and grey fur on his chest and belly.  He rubbed and scratched his abdomen.  He was growing carpet of badger fur on his chest and felt it growing on his back.  He felt his face and realized that it was happening there too.  If he could have seen himself in a mirror, he would see the beginnings of the distinctive black and white stripes on his face and his nose and lips beginning to darken.  The backs of his arms were growing dark with fur.<br />
<br />
He was brought out of his musings about his growing furriness by his aching cock.  He watched it finish changing into the proper shape for a badger, not that he had ever noticed an animal’s cock before, but he guessed this was the right shape, given what was happening.  His cock was growing huge and it demanded attention.  His mind became simpler in thought as he began to stroke himself with a clawed hand that rivaled that of the ursine animorphs.  Lustfully, he began to lick and suck on his own cock.  Inside of his mind ‘Mac the Man’, the extremely heterosexual human male, was disgusted by what was happening, but ‘Blocker the Badger’ was in complete bliss.  He was reliving his swollen balls of he last vestiges of Mac’s human genetics.  Blocker the Badger kneaded and fondled his balls with one growing clawed hand and pumped the elongated shaft with the other.  If Mac had, had a cell mate, male or female, he would be releasing his load into whichever hole was first presented.  It’s what made the milking machines so easy to use; the animorph would bliss out and provide as much semen as the beast could pump out before it was sated.  The beast didn’t care as long as its sexual needs were fulfilled.  Mac the Man went into a sort of hypnotic state as the Blocker the Badger gained complete control.  The badger licked up and sucked down the last drops of human seed and was coaxing out the first badger-man sperm.<br />
<br />
By the time Mac Blocker the badger-man had regained the balance in his mind between beast and man and could think clearly again, he was completely transformed.<br />
<br />
Mac didn’t like being changed against his will, but he had to admit, he had the best of both worlds now.  Mack had been a stocky man since he was in high school and was on the wrestling team.  His time in the army had just increased his muscular, stocky physique.  Now, he noted that he was much more powerful than he had been before.  That bastard Rothman had only done him a favor.  He heard Billy and George in the other rooms.  Though the rooms were generally sound proof to the human ear, his new ears were picking up their grunts and moans and garbled words that sounded like, “Oh, fuck, yeah!” and “God that’s good!”.  He guessed the milking machines were providing them with the same kind of distraction his auto-fellatio had provided for him and he knew that the machine would still be attached and he’d still be blissfully shooting out loads if he hadn’t acted so quickly.<br />
<br />
In retrospect, sucking one’s own cock wasn’t that bad and he had rather enjoyed it.  He had bragged to his buddies that if he could do such a thing, he’d never leave the house.  Well, he found now that, that wasn’t quite true.  He wanted out of this cell more than he wanted to suck his cock again, though at the thought of doing it, his huge badger cock gave a jerk and his balls tingled in anticipation.<br />
<br />
He’d fix Rothman, but first he had to get out of here and free his partners.  George’s new bulk and raw power would be of great use and Billy’s new agility and wiry strength could help them all get out of here.  The problem now was this: Mac the Man knew that his codes had been locked out by now, but he had a secret code he hadn’t bothered telling anyone about that could free him he just needed to get to the keypad.  Upon examining Blocker the Badger’s hands, he realized it would be awhile before he was dexterous enough with the clawed hands to use them without hitting the wrong keys.  He knew that if he were to break the reinforced glass, which he could easily do, he might reach the keypad by the door.  But if he hit the wrong sequence, it would activate alarms and flood his cell with a neurotoxin that would kill him in seconds.  The antechamber just before the holding cell would activate the air-tight seals against the gas and the solid steel doors would be locked tight as a bank vault.<br />
<br />
There wasn’t any immunity to that and it didn’t matter how strong you were.  He’d seen the same toxin used on test subjects to insure it’s effectiveness on mammalian, reptilian and avian life.  He’d also seen it used on animorphs and it was quite effective.  Basic biology didn’t change, just because you were a hybrid of two mammals.  The neurotransmitters still required certain chemicals to function.  These cells weren’t the local county jail; they were designed to contain biohazard level life-forms, so Mac Blocker had to be careful.<br />
<br />
Everything would be just fine, if he could just see to punch the keypad and if he could reach the keypad.  There were no reflective surfaces in the antechamber and none available in the cell that he could squeeze through the 8”x8” window after he’d broken out the reinforced glass.  Even the milker had been automatically retracted to a place he couldn’t get to it when he’d removed if from his groin.<br />
<br />
Mac was sure he could do it; he just needed to figure out how.  He sat and calmed himself, he had a plan.  As he thought it through, he heard George and Billy in the throes of their final orgasm.  He heard the milkers shut off and then he heard loud snoring.  It was George was most certainly, the man had been his friend for years and he’d heard him snore many times when he’d fall asleep in Mac’s recliner after dinner.  He’d given Mac a job and stepped aside when this promotion came up so that Mac could take it.  George said he was old, he had enough pay and he didn’t need the headache.  That was partly true, George had, had heart bypass surgery and he probably couldn’t have taken the stress. George had been like a father to him and he was angered that Rothman had punished him, punished them, buy making them experiments for the army’s use.  It was Mac’s fault that George and Billy too, were in this mess.  He was just too ambitious.  If it weren’t for him talking them into selling out to Transgene, they’d both be home now, same as they had always been and not on their way to a breeding program.<br />
<br />
Mac put aside all his anger and concern, mostly for George, and concentrated on the task ahead; he realized the incredible risk he was about to take.</p>
