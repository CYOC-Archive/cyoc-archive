<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">True to Samantha’s word last night; she was up before Frances. The were-cat slinking and crawling to her goal; she gives her curious kittens, Saffron and Jasmine a playful lick as she continues to her destination. Purring as Samantha sees the wonderful line of folded pink skin surrounded by her life partner’s auburn fur; the eager were-cat licks her lips in eagerness as she spreads Frances legs apart and buries her muzzle into the awaiting cleft.<br />
<br />
Frances started to stir. Feeling warm and flush; a pleasant feeling was emanating from her loins. Opening her eyes to see her were-cat partner using her tongue and teeth to work at the already lubricated and engorged set of lips; Frances sighed as a jolt of pleasure washed over her. Knowing that Samantha is tickling and teasing the outer folds before continuing her explorations; Frances feels the urge to play with her breasts. Twisting tweeking her nipples as she moans; feeling the rough feline tongue of Samantha scrape inside her tunnel, Frances shudders as she feels Samantha hitting another sensitive spot. Then another, and another; soon Frances was tensing up as her whole body was alight with electric sensations. Her nerves firing at a rapid rate as she starts to pant. With her back starting to arc and her eyes glazing over; Frances yowls as she explodes in orgasmic bliss. Her sex pulsing and throbbing as it pours forth her lubricating juices; feeling Samantha lapping up the fluids, her tongue helping to extend the orgasm as it continues to stimulate the writhing were-feline.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
In the middle of a forested area of Moon Lake sits a large tent. Its occupants still fast asleep despite the fact that the sun is already up and shinning down on their covered retreat. If it were not for the were-alert; the two happy werewolves would be sleeping on the forest floor enjoying each others warm embrace outside. Instead they made do with a tent; even that was risky for anyone could have opened it up and see two weres sleeping with in. Fortunately, both Ben and Alex were in a section of Moon Lake reserved for weres only when camping or hunting.<br />
<br />
Sensing the light making the tent bright; its orange coloring clearly visible inside; Ben stirs. Feeling his lover still enveloping him; the werewolf gives off a happy growl. His stirring making Alex hug and embrace him more as the second werewolf nuzzles Ben affectionately.<br />
“Morning,” Alex sighing; “sleep well?”<br />
“With you next to me,” Ben rumbling; “always. Last night was perfect,” Ben just laying on the tent floor; “you rutting me to sleep and feeling your knot swell and lodge in my back door, I couldn’t ask for a better night cap.”<br />
“Yet all good things must come to an end,” Alex  letting go of ben and getting up; his lupine member long since retreated from last night’s session and safely in its sheathe; “you have to head home and deal with you argument with you mother still.”<br />
“Don’t remind me,” Ben growling; “I’m not exactly eager to deal with that.”<br />
“I’m sure your mothers aren’t either,” Alex defurring and putting on yesterday’s clothes; “but you both said some nasty things to each other yesterday. You can’t let it fester.”<br />
<br />
Ben knew Alex was right; the seventeen year old was mad that he lost his job with Grrrrrrr before he could officially start working. Being ordered to remain closed while Frederick Parker and his men were in town; the artic were-fox owner was less than thrilled at receiving the order straight from the mayor’s office. Despite being told it was a prudent course of action; the owner of Grrrrrrr was still incensed and promptly rescinded the job offer to Ben. Ben who was pissed at the turn of events promptly informed his mother Samantha what happened and expressed his anger over the matter. Frances trying to act as a peacemaker didn’t help and only caused the werewolf to growl and curse in anger as he stormed out of the house.<br />
<br />
Now it is morning and he is looking at his boyfriend Alex. Sighing Ben begins to shift from his werewolf form to his more mundane human form. Feeling the fur retreat back into his skin; his bones shifting and popping as he begins to get dressed, Ben felt sad that he couldn’t be in his lupine form any longer than he had last night. Yearning to be fully furry on Monday, but knowing that is not possible because of the criminals from San-Francisco, Ben as Alex a question.<br />
“Do you and Nate still need help with the Landscaping business?”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“Morning dear,” Samantha purring as she finishes cleaning Frances up with her tongue; “did you like my wakeup call?”<br />
You know I did,” Frances still feeling buzzed with Samantha’s ministrations; “now give me our morning kiss my love.”<br />
<br />
“Gladly,” Samantha quickly crawling up to Frances’s feline muzzle and kissing her cat style. Frances doing the same; both purr as they look into each other’s eyes and envelop each other in a loving hug.<br />
“I’d ask if you’d want breakfast,” Frances smiling; “but it’s clear you filled up on my honey.”<br />
“I still have room for some grapefruit,” Samantha nuzzling her life partner; “what say we get up and get some food in us and in the waiting kittens that clearly saw our naughty act with eat other.”<br />
“You by any chance didn’t hear Ben come home last night did you,” Frances letting her partner go as she gets out of bed.<br />
“No,” Samantha looking glum; “but we do need to talk to him about last night. After breakfast we need to look for him.”<br />
“I say we wait,” Frances putting on a bath robe; her twitching tail keeping the hem from brushing the ground; “let him come to us. It’s not as if either of us has anything pressing at the moment?”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“Your serious,” Alex looking at Ben; “you want to work with me and Nate?”<br />
“It’s not as if I have any other job interviews lined up,” Ben answering; “and I doubt I’m going to get a call back from Grrrrrrr. Not after they received the shutdown letter from mom.”<br />
“What if the letter came from the elder council,” Alex asking; “you think the owner would of still would have change his mind in hiring you?”<br />
“I asked him that,” Ben answering; “asked if he would of reacted the way he did if it came straight from Tachibana. His ears twitched and he sort of whined upon mentioning the were-fox rep. Yet he still rescinded the hiring process.”<br />
“Then perhaps you should have you mother talk to Tachibana about what happened,” Alex commenting; “let the skulk leader deal with matter.”<br />
“Maybe,” Ben sighing as he turns his cellphone back on; seeing the have dozen missed calls from his mother and the text from Austin Perry. “Austin texted me,” Ben looking at the message; “with the were-alert, tonight’s pack meeting to induct two new members has been cancelled.”<br />
“Two,” Alex looking confused; “Someone else other than Zylina Nash wanting to join as well?”<br />
“You don’t think the second is Nate’s mate,” Ben smiling; “as an honorary member?”<br />
“Could be,” Alex chuckling; “those two are defiantly an item and they did have a were-wedding recently. Hell they practically act as husband and wife.”<br />
“Well I suppose we should take down the tent and head home,” Ben sighing as he hung his phone around his neck thanks to the oversized lanyard.</p>
