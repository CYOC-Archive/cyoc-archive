<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You may want to reconsider smiling,” said Rachel.  <br />
<br />
“How about this?” I said as I stood up.  “I’ll go wait for you and you surprise me.”<br />
<br />
She smiled devilishly.  “I don’t think that will be a problem,” she said. <br />
<br />
I ran to my bedroom as quick as I could.  I definitely noticed my breasts bouncing up and down on my chest.  They certainly felt weird and it did hurt just a little, but I also liked the overall sensation of them.  When I reached my bed I threw myself on it.  I focused my attention on my breasts.  I couldn’t help but give them a few good squeezes to really see how they felt.  They felt nice.  They were soft yet firm and most importantly they felt completely natural, as if I’d always had them.  They were a part of me.<br />
<br />
Just then Rachel entered the room.  I noticed that she had Joyce’s bag of “goodies” with her.  “Enjoying your new body, are you?” she asked.  I didn’t answer.  I was kind of afraid to, since I didn’t know if she was “in character” yet, so to speak.  “Come on, I want to know,” she said in a normal tone of voice.<br />
<br />
“I’m trying to get used to them,” I said.  “I love the way they feel.”<br />
<br />
“Good,” she said.  “I can’t wait till they’re full sized.  So, again, I have to ask, are you sure you can handle me dominating you?”<br />
<br />
“I said I trust you,” I told her.  “I still do.”<br />
<br />
“Great,” she said.  “This is going to get really kinky.”  She took off her panties and pulled off my socks.  Then she reached into the bag and pulled out a pair of handcuffs.  “Now let’s see how we’re going to do this.  Your bed doesn’t have any posts.  Or a headboard of any kind.  Hmm.  What are we going to do about that?”<br />
<br />
I understood exactly what she wanted.  “I wish that my bed had a headboard that had several individual bars in it so that something could fit through them and I wish that only Rachel and I would remember my bed looking any differently.”  Instantly the wish was granted.  My bed had the headboard I requested.<br />
<br />
She climbed up on the bed and crawled up to me.  She took my left wrist and put one end of the handcuffs around it.  She made sure it was secure but not too tight.  Then she pulled my arm up to the headboard and ran the loose end of the handcuffs through one of the open spaces.  She pulled it back through another open space and then attached it to my right wrist.  I was now handcuffed around the headboard.<br />
<br />
Next she pulled out two pieces of long cloth.  She tied one piece each to my ankles.  Then she realized she had no place to where she could tie them.  I sighed and wished for the bed to have to end posts and again that only we would remember them not being there.  As soon as they appeared she eagerly tied the cloths around the posts.  I was now completely tied down and attached to my bed, unable to really move at all.<br />
<br />
“Now for the really kinky part,” she said.  I wasn’t sure how much kinkier we could get.  That was only because I didn’t know any better.  She pulled something else out of the bag and showed it to me.  I had no idea what it was.  “We call this a ball gag,” she said.  My eyes went wide with fear.  I wasn’t expecting this.  But before I could raise an objection to it, she placed the ball in my mouth and attached the gag around the back of my head.  “Can you breathe OK?” she asked.  I nodded as best I could.  “Can you say something?” she asked.<br />
<br />
I said, “Something,” but it came out as “Smmmfffnngg.”  <br />
<br />
“Since you can still talk, let’s come up with a safe word, though I don’t think we’ll need one,” she said.  “How about something hot like…‘cumshot?’  Say that so I know what it sounds like.”<br />
<br />
“Cmmshht,” I said as best I could.<br />
<br />
“Now you are mine, you little bitch,” she said.  She went back to the bag and pulled out another strap-on dildo.  Only this one also vibrated.  “Your first real penetration is gonna make you squeal, bitch,” she said.  <br />
<br />
She inched herself closer to me little by little.  She really teased the moment when I would feel that huge, vibrating thing penetrate my presumably fully developed pussy.  As soon as it made contact with my womanhood I immediately let out a muffled moan and closed my eyes.  “Yea, you like this, don’t you, bitch?  Let’s see just how much of it you can take, my willing little bitch.”<br />
 <br />
She slid the dildo further into my pussy.  As she did I felt incredible pleasure and I moaned to let her know how I felt.  When she could go no further she said, “Would you look at that?  You can take the whole thing!  Oh, you are such a perfect little bitch fuck toy, aren’t you?”<br />
 <br />
I was able to muffle, “Mm-hmm.”<br />
 <br />
“See, I knew you’d like it,” she said.  “I can always tell.  How does that feel right now?”<br />
 <br />
I tried to say, “It’s incredible.”  What came out through the gag was, “Tttss nncrddbbll.”<br />
 <br />
“If I heard you right, then I’m sure you’ll love this,” she said.  She started to thrust her hips back and forth.  Now she was truly fucking me with that vibrating piece of pleasure.  I wasn’t quite prepared for what she did next.  While she continued to thrust back and forth she fell on top of me so that her face was right in front of mine.  “Look at you up close, all tied up and helpless.  Just like a good bitch should be.  You know, there’s one part of you I haven’t been able to do anything with yet.  Ooh.  Can you feel them?  Doesn’t that feel so good to have our tits rubbing against each other’s?  Look at mine,” she said as she lifted herself slightly.  “Look how hard my nipples are.”  She ran her delicate fingers over them.  “Ooh, they’re so sensitive.  Oh, god, I’m getting myself hot.  I bet you’d like to suck on them, wouldn’t you, bitch?  And I’d love for you to do that, but you’re mouth’s a little occupied, isn’t it?  Well would you look at that?   Your nipples are just as hard as mine.  In fact, I think they might already be bigger than mine.  Oh, I think they’re aching for some attention.  Should I give them some?  Should I, bitch?”<br />
 <br />
“Mm-hmm,” I muffled in between moans.<br />
 <br />
“You asked for it,” she said.  She proceeded to pounce back down on me.  I thought she was just going to tease my nipples with her fingers.  But I wasn’t listening closely enough to her.  She teased me not being able to suck on hers.  Well that’s exactly what she did to mine.  She took turns placing each one of them in her mouth and then licking, sucking and even biting them.  Holy shit, did I find out that I had some pretty sensitive nipples.  It hurt a little when she bit them, but as with everything else so far I felt much more pleasure than pain.  I was coming to terms with the fact that the wish we made was resulting in me having a body that was part nymphomaniac and part sex toy.<br />
 <br />
My moans grew steadily louder and more intense as she continued to fuck my pussy.  I had a feeling it was just a matter of seconds before I climaxed.  Rachel stopped sucking my nipples and lifted herself off my body.  As a result she just fucked me harder.  I tried to scream but it was pretty much muffled by the gag.  For a brief second I felt my eyes roll back into my head and I lost control of my facial muscles.  Only Rachel knows what I looked like.  I snapped out of it when I heard Rachel exclaim.  I focused my eyes to see that not only had I just had my first full female orgasm, but my pussy actually squirted right onto Rachel’s breasts.  “Oh, so you’re a squirmer and a screamer, are you, my little bitch?” she said.  She ran her finger over her breasts and then placed it in her mouth and sucked it.  “Mmm, you taste good, bitch,” she said.<br />
 <br />
I felt the tension in my body slowly dissipate.  I relaxed as much as I could considering the position I was in.  But Rachel only allowed me about a minute to recover.  Before I knew it, she was aggressively moving around me.  She untied my ankles from the posts and she unlocked me from the handcuffs.  I found, predictably, that my wrists were a bit sore and had visible red marks on them.  Finally she took the gag out of my mouth.  Then she once again pounced down on me.  Only this time she shoved her tongue into my mouth.  I immediately returned her kiss and we started a prolonged makeout session.  I could taste the remnants of my orgasm on her lips.  It was still weird to me.  My mind was more focused on her, however. <br />
 <br />
I reached down and began to massage her ass.  Then I sensed that she was letting me have control.  So I rolled us over so that I was on top of her.  She didn’t object at all.  After a few more seconds I stopped kissing her.  I just looked at her and admired her face.  “You’re so beautiful,” I whispered.<br />
 <br />
She stroked my face with the back of her hand.  I sighed contentedly.  “So are you,” she said.  “Even though your face and body don’t match,” she said with a laugh.<br />
 <br />
“Hey!” I pouted.<br />
 <br />
“I’m sorry,” she said, still laughing a little.  “You don’t see yourself the way I do.  But now it’s your turn to take charge.”<br />
 <br />
She pushed me off her so that she could get up.  She took off the dildo, which she had stopped vibrating at some point in the last few minutes, and quickly attached it to me.  Then she handed me the handcuffs.  She placed her arms behind her back and clasped her wrists together.  “Go ahead,” she said.  I obliged her and locked her in the handcuffs.  “Now here’s what I want you to do, bitch,” she said as she got back into character.  “I want you to turn that baby on and fuck me in the ass.  And since I won’t be able to hold myself up, you’re going to have to do that.  I want you to hold me by the hair.”<br />
 <br />
Suddenly I was very afraid.  “Won’t that hurt you?” I asked.  I was still quite worried about having her relive any past bad experiences. <br />
 <br />
“No, it won’t,” she said.  “And I also want you to reach around and slap me tits a few times.”  Now my eyes went wide with shock.  “Just trust me,” she said.  “I’ll be fine.  Last thing…” she reached back down to the bed and picked up the ball gag.  “Put this on me.”<br />
 <br />
“OK,” I said.  “I just hope you’re right.”  I put the gag in her mouth and attached it around her head.  Then I turned on the vibrator and stuck it into her ass.  As soon as I did, she started to fall face first onto the bed.  I remembered just at the nick of time to grab her by the hair.  Unfortunately I ended up really tugging on it in the process.  She made a muffled scream and I couldn’t tell if it was one of pain or pleasure.<br />
 <br />
I slowly brought her closer to me as I continued to pump her ass with the dildo.  She was clearly enjoying it as she pushed back against me as hard as I thrust into her.  I now had her so close to me that I stopped holding onto her hair.  Instead I wrapped my arms around her and my hands began to massage her breasts.  I pinched her nipples with the same intensity that she had done to mine.  Then I obliged her request and I playfully slapped her breasts from side to side.  She gave several muffled moans of approval.  Eventually I forgot about pulling on her hair and held her closely just by fondling her breasts.  She didn’t seem to mind based upon the fact that she kept pushing back into me harder and harder.  I did all I could to oblige her by forcing the dildo into her as much as I could.<br />
<br />
Eventually she screamed in such a way that I realized she climaxed.  I carefully removed the dildo without letting go of her.  I moved her into a sitting position while I retrieved the key for the handcuffs.  I quickly removed them and the ball gag.  “Whoo!” she said once the gag was removed.  “That was hot.”  She looked at me to see that I had a mostly unenthusiastic look on my face.  “What’s wrong?” she asked.<br />
 <br />
“I’m just…not sure about some of this all of a sudden,” I said.<br />
 <br />
She frowned.  “What do you mean?” she asked.<br />
 <br />
“I can’t believe you’d want me to do something that could hurt you,” I said.  “After what happened to you…I’m not comfortable pulling your hair or hitting you anywhere.”<br />
 <br />
“I knew you were holding back!” she said.  I was surprised by her response.  She seemed more concerned with what I hadn’t done to her as opposed to my concerns about what I had done.  When she recognized this she said, “Joe, you didn’t hurt me.  Honestly.”<br />
 <br />
“Terrific,” I said sarcastically.  “But what happens if I do?”<br />
 <br />
Rachel laid down on the bed.  “Do you want to fight about this?” she asked.<br />
 <br />
“No, I don’t want to fight,” I said.  “But I don’t want to feel uncomfortable doing something, either.  I don’t have any problems with what you’ve done to me.  Can’t you understand why I’m reluctant to do something to you?”<br />
 <br />
“Of course I do,” she said.  “I think you need to realize that you’re not a big, strong man anymore.  I don’t think you could hurt me like that if you tried.”  I looked at her with frustration evident on my face.  “OK, OK, I get it.  Look…”  She sat up again and moved herself close to me.  Once again she rubbed my face with the back of her hand.  “I do understand why you’re worried.  But I do enjoy going a little far in bed.  If you think that led to me being abused, you’re wrong.  He didn’t hit me because he couldn’t understand the difference.  He did it because he was an abusive asshole.”<br />
 <br />
“So you really think I’m getting worked up over nothing?” I asked.<br />
 <br />
“No,” she said, “not over nothing.  But you are worrying too much.  It’s obvious that this type of bedroom relationship is new for you, so you’re not comfortable with it yet.  I have to guide you through it.  You’ve been willing to trust me with what I’ve done to you, so please trust me when I say that if you hurt me, I’ll tell you.  You don’t have to worry about hurting me.”<br />
 <br />
I managed a little smile.  “I suppose I can do that,” I said.<br />
 <br />
“Great,” she said.  “By the way,” she said as she continued to stroke my cheek, “I think your face is starting to change.”<br />
 <br />
“Really?  How so?”  I asked excitedly.<br />
 <br />
“Your cheeks feel smoother and rounder,” she said.  “I think you might end up a little baby-faced.”<br />
 <br />
“Does that mean I have to keep the pigtails?” I asked.<br />
 <br />
“Don’t you like them?” she asked back.<br />
 <br />
“I’m not sure yet,” I admitted.  “Let’s see how my face turns out.”<br />
 <br />
“By the way, before we go back out there, there’s something I want to ask you,” she said.  “Something that Joyce and I are gonna wanna do once you all finish changing.”<br />
 <br />
I raised an eyebrow.  “Oh?  What’s that?” I asked.<br />
 <br />
She smiled and then took a deep breath.  She said, “Well…”</p>
