<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexis stood in the hall again, this time he wasn’t late for his class. In order to get his seat at the back of the classroom, he made his way to the classroom.<br />
Upon arrival. He saw only a few students present, even Miss Thorne was missing. Once again, odd.<br />
<br />
Alexis walked to the back of the room, finding the desk he wanted. As always, there was a ‘N+T’ carved into the wood. In all his years, he’d never figured out who that was, but he hoped they found true love after all.<br />
He placed his bag down, realising he had forgotten to get the required book from his locker. He sighed, not wanted to lose his spot, he hoped that he had a spare notebook to use. But to his surprise, he found the exact book he needed. Right there, in his bag. Once again, his new powers working ahead of himself.<br />
Thinking about that, Alexis remembered what Justin had said,<br />
‘You’re only eighteen once,’<br />
He thought about it in his mind. What if it meant something else. What if it was his powers telling him that he only had them today, and that once his 18th birthday was over, that was it. His powers, gone. He questioned it. He didn’t believe it, but if he had just suddenly developed these powers overnight, then it’s just as easy for them to disappear. He stopped himself from thinking about it. As crazy as these powers were, he quite liked having them, regardless of the impact they have when his emotions take over. <br />
And perfectly on time, a distraction arrived.<br />
<br />
Monica walked through the door, she looked Alexis in the eyes as she subconsciously smiled with happiness. She made her way to the back of the room, choosing whether to sit right next to Alexis, or leave a one seat gap. Alexis hoped for the gap. And lucky for him, she chose the same. Maybe his powers had helped him once again, but he couldn’t be sure.<br />
He saw Monica take a few quick looks at him when she thought he wasn’t looking. He never really cared about the attention before, but for some reason it was getting a little annoying.<br />
<br />
Before long, Miss Thorne finally arrived. She walked into the classroom, still wearing the tight clothes Alexis had left her in,<br />
“Looks like we’ve almost got a full class,” Miss Thorne said aloud, “we’re just missing...” she flipped through her book, “the siblings,” she remarked.<br />
Alexis didn’t think Barry and Brie were in this class, but not long after he realised who she meant.<br />
<br />
Wilson walked in, rubbing his left arm, “s-sorry ma’am, I lost track of time,” he said, sniffing his nose. He sat down on the left side of the classroom, next to the window. He almost immediately started looking out of it,<br />
“Oookay,” Miss Thorne said, “and no sign of your sister, then?” She asked,<br />
“She’ll be-” Wilson hesitated, “I think she’ll be here in a minute,”<br />
“Okay then,” Miss Thorne said, “I guess we’ll have to start without her,” she said, moving to the whiteboard to write something down, “do we all remember what I told you was happening today?” She asked,<br />
The class looked clueless. Even Alexis didn’t remember.<br />
“Brilliant,” she said, pushing her glasses up, “well, since no one remembers, I suppose-”<br />
“Here Miss,” suddenly the missing arrived, “sorry I’m late,” She said, insincerely,<br />
“Miss Smith,” Miss Thorne started, the class was prepared for a detention to be placed, “any particular reason why you’re late?”<br />
“Well...” Brianna said, shooting an evil look at her brother, “I guess I just lost track of time,” she said, shrugging her shoulders. She scanned the classroom for a seat, there were a few around the room,<br />
“You’re lucky,” Miss Thorne said, looking at the clock, “you’re only two minutes late. I’ll let you off, but this will be the last time,” she said, surprising everyone. Then, in a voice directed at the whole class, “and that goes for everyone in here, I won’t be this forgiving again. Trust me,”<br />
Not listening, Brianna had already found her seat. She had locked eyes with Alexis from afar and let out a not-so-subtle smirk as she strutted her way to the back of the classroom. With no alternative choices, not that she would have picked them, she sat at the seat next to Alexis. Blocking the view that Monica had left.<br />
<br />
“Hey Alexis,” she whispered, softly. Trying to get his attention,<br />
“Hey,” Alexis said, not looking at her. He would rather do actual work than deal with this. Miss Thorne was busy adding Brianna to the list of names,<br />
“A little birdie told me that it’s your birthday today,” Brianna claimed confidently, trying to get Alexis to look at her. Alexis eventually did, he looked at her. She looked deep into his eyes, into his soul. She was hot, of course, there was a reason half the class had the hots for her. But she the absolute opposite of the kind of person Alexis found attractive. She was fake in every aspect, everything except for her body. She was just naturally sexy. Wilson had confirmed to the group that his family prevented her from getting any kind of plastic surgery.<br />
“Yeah it is,” Alexis replied, “all day, actually,” he wittily added. Monica giggled at his joke, to which Brianna scowled at her,<br />
“Well,” she started, “I hope my brother got you the best gift,” she remarked, glancing at Wilson, who was still looking out the window, “just remember that whatever he bought you, it’s from me as well,”<br />
Alexis smirked, “actually, he didn’t get me anything, I always told-”<br />
“He didn’t!?” She said, eyes wide, frustrated,<br />
“No, no, listen. I never-”<br />
“I cannot believe him!” She said, not listening to Alexis. She started ranting to Monica, loud enough for Alexis to hear, “I mean, of all the people he could forget to buy a gift for, why him!? Probably spent the money on junk food, that fat little-”<br />
“Okay everyone!” Miss Thorne said loudly, interrupting Brianna, “now that we’re back on track. Let me remind you all, today is a group project. You will be working in...” she stood there for a moment, “either groups of two or three,” she asked the class,<br />
“Miss Thorne!” Brianna shouted out,<br />
“Raise your hand, Miss Smith,”<br />
“Sorry.” She said, raising her hand,<br />
“Yes?”<br />
“I’m just thinking. If we work in groups of two, we will be more likely to work as a team than in groups of three,” she commented, looking at Alexis eagerly. Alexis silently sighed,<br />
“I suppose that does make sense,” Miss Thorne said, “well, groups of two it is. Pairs, in fact,” she joked to herself. Typical Math teacher joke, “Miss Smith, you will be paired with Mr Blake,” she stated. Brianna’s eyes widened,<br />
“What!?” She yelled,<br />
“Excuse me!” Miss Thorne said, “do not raise that tone with me, I never said you could pick your own partner,”<br />
“Bu-bu-but...”<br />
“No buts!” Miss Thorne made it clear, “Mr Blake, go sit next to Miss Smith,” she ordered the student. Peter Blake stood up from the front of the class and walked to Brianna, “now Miss Griffin, you can sit next to Mr Powell,”<br />
<br />
In the end, Monica and Alexis were paired together while Brianna was stuck with Peter Blake. He wasn’t the biggest geek of all time, being that he was on the football team, but not someone Brianna wanted to be paired with.<br />
Monica and Brianna switched seats, leaving Monica next to Alexis, Brianna next to Monica, and Peter next to Brianna.</p>
