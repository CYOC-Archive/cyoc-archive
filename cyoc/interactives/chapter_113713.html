<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephan had driven Jesse... Jessica as he wanted to now be known to cheerleading tryouts. Jessie instructions were to get with the girls and drain there - what was the word? Sexual energy sounded right to Jessica. I had to drain a little from some viral girls. Not too much or it would be noticeable . Take it all from one and they could even become a boy. Not much of a boy, but they would absorb what masculinity, Jesse had left. Contact was needed. grabbing or touching an arm was OK, but took a long time to transfer. Oral sex was optimal but would transfer too fast and would be impossible to pull off. A kiss on the other hand was quick and efficient. Jessica was shooting for getting a few slaps to the face and not arrested.<br />
<br />
Stephan had given Jessica new clothes. Girls clothes. A fitted shirt with room left for growing breasts. A short pleated skirt. Cute flats (didn&#39;t want to push difficult shoes like heels). And a new short girly cut that flattered Jessie&#39;s face. All his facial and body hair had disappeared when Andy had sexually neutered him. Now he had to admit that he made a cute but not sexy chick. A real seven out of ten.<br />
<br />
Jessica was afraid of running into Karen but his girlfriend didn&#39;t seem to be here after getting with Andy. So, he set his sites on some freshmen girls. A tall girl and short girl Neither looked very viral but would make a good test. They should be confused with everything new. He hung around with the cheerleaders in his former life and should now them all by name but being the dick he was, he didn&#39;t care about anyone else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me. I was going for band tryouts. Could you direct me that way? My name is Jessica by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Summer,&quot; the short girl said in a nasal voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Roxxi with two x&#39;s,&quot; said a tall, black girl. &quot;The band tryouts are in the north hall of the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re too cute for band. You should be a cheerleader.&quot; Summer then laughed a nasal, annoying laugh that would haunt Jessica all her days.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks girls.&quot; Jessica gripped their hands in thanks.<br />
<br />
He could feel energy being transferred. At first it made him feel weak as it took the last of his fading manhood. Then he started to feel stronger--<br />
<br />
The girls pulled free and stared at Jessica as if she were naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We gotta go.&quot; With that the girls disappeared.<br />
<br />
Jessica looked down. She now had burgeoning A cup breasts. And the penis was still there but nearly clit like in size. His balls had shrunk to the size of raisins. And Jessica&#39;s hair had gotten slightly longer.<br />
<br />
Than he... she had a thought. How far do I want to take this. I can not only be a girl but I can be a girl with looks of my choosing. Big tits, big ass, toned ass, abs, hips, lips, and anything else she wanted. Now might be her only chance. She just had to pick out her targets.<br />
<br />
He watched the girls for a few minutes and chosen the long legs of one. The round tits on another. Lips on a third. Jessica felt excited. She would be the perfect looking girl and didn&#39;t have to hurt anyone to do it. Well, not too much anyway.<br />
<br />
Than a red sports car pulled in. The doors swung open and four girls piled out. The driver got out and was wearing booty shorts and a loose fitting t-shirt. She made the other girls carry her stuff. Jessica new it was cheerleading co-captain. Bella Townsend.<br />
<br />
Bella was a rival to Karen and Karen hated her. She was just a bitch to everyone else. Even her friends.<br />
<br />
Jessica smiled evilly. I could take something from everyone or everything from one. She had to admit that Bella was the hottest girl in school, Built and liked to show it off. Long legged. Toned. Large breasted. Beautiful, long brown hair, green eyes. Pouty lips that weren&#39;t overdone. One target to rule them all. A grad A bitch.<br />
<br />
Bella was still getting stuff out of her car when the other girls went in. Jessica made her move. She walked up behind Bella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bella jumped. &quot;What the fuck do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to tell you that I have seen you around school--&quot;<br />
<br />
Bella looked annoyed. &quot;And?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are beautiful. I mean--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks lesbo. Now leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.&quot; But instead Jessica stood her ground.<br />
<br />
Bella stepped toward her and started to open her mouth to threaten Jessica. Jessica lunged and kissed Bella with tongue. And quickly slid a hand up her shirt cupping her breast. Jessica wasn&#39;t taking any chances of being cut off to quick and besides Jesse had always wanted to feel her up and now was his last chance as he changed.<br />
<br />
Jessica shouldn&#39;t have worried. Bella froze and so did Jessica. Bella&#39;s energy was so much more powerful than the other two girls combined. Jessica could feel the power enter her. She felt stronger and stronger. More powerful with each second. Jessica&#39;s body was tingling. She decided she might be having her first orgasm as a lady.<br />
<br />
Jessica came to herself and new she had to let go. She threw Bella backwards while pulling their mouths apart. Bella hit the ground unconscious. Jessica watched to see that Bella was still breathing and she was. Jessica also noticed that Bella&#39;s huge melons were now more like peaches.<br />
<br />
Jessica got up and ran. What if she wakes up and tells the police I assaulted her. Stephan pulled up and Jessica jumped in.<br />
<br />
He drove them back to his mom&#39;s place. Jessica ran in and was scared of being caught. She ran into the bathroom and slammed the door. She looked in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Jessica realized that she wouldn&#39;t be found. She wasn&#39;t the boyish girl she had been when she walked up to Bella. Now she was six inches taller, five foot nine at least. Jessica&#39;s face still had the old Jesse/Jessica shape to it but her lips were fuller. Her hair was now shoulder length. Jessica never had nearly that long. Ever. The new Jessica&#39;s breast were firm and large. D-cup? Yes. Smaller waist and rounded hips. She turned around and found a curvy booty.<br />
<br />
Jessica started stripping down to have a personal look at her body. It was amazing. Curves in all the right places. If Jesse was here right now he would cum in his pants thought Jessica. But having said that, Jessica started feeling a bit naughty herself.<br />
<br />
Jessica slowly started to rub her labia. Carefully going around the clitoris and all its many, many nerves. Jessica continued to rub feeling a slow build of pleasure. Wave after wave of warmth. Than a sudden moistening of her vagina made an adventurous Jessica want to go exploring. Slowly Jessica inserted two fingers into her vagina letting the natural lube work. Jessica didn&#39;t know her body yet so she explored until she found a spot a few inches in that seemed to swell and feel good. Jessica focused on that area. It started building. She thought about Andy. He had the biggest cock she knew but it did nothing. Than Stephan. That was it. He built into an intense wave upon wave of pleasure that rocked Jessica&#39;s body. She thrashed around and grabbed for anything to squeeze while she came. A flood of liquid gushed and the waves slowly subsided after about two minutes of orgasm.<br />
<br />
Shit was all Jessica could think.<br />
<br />
Jessica came out of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia is there. &quot;I hope you enjoyed your new body young one. Although, you have work to do that should have come before you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you forgotten the reason you came here? Tell me know.&quot;<br />
<br />
The memory flooded back. &quot;To help andy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother. You must help him right now. He will not live to see a new day if you do not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica was beside herself. How could she have forgotten her little brother. He needed her. &quot;How do I help him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is only one way. You are the Yen to his Yang. The female to his male. You must have carnal relations with him. The spell upon you will temper his libido and stabilize him. To be blunt you must fuck the hell out of your brother.&quot;</p>
