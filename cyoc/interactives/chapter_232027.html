<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Si id quod vis, fiat.”<br />
The voice calmly speaking from the night sky; it was ethereal, chilling yet comforting, holding no malice in its timbre. Those who were not centaur cocked an ear in confusion; however the Centaurs present recognized the words and that it was in Latin.<br />
“If that is what you wish, then so be it,” Rang through the ears of the centaurs.<br />
<br />
Zoey instantly felt pressure within her as she started to collapse and fall; June helped by supporting Zoey and guiding her down to the ground.<br />
“It feels like I’m giving birth,” Zoey grimacing as her rear end swells and starts to push away; dragging her legs as they twist and morph in to hind legs while her new mass rapidly fills out into equine proportions. Zoey gasped as she felt her bones pop and snap, yet was not in tears. Closing her eyes as she feels the pressure of her forelegs starting to grow; she begins to breathe hard as new organs form. Her equine frame heaving with each breath she took.<br />
“oooooooh,” Zoe moaned as she felt her sex grow and relocate to just under her anus; her human reproductive organs growing and becoming equine deep within her. Taking on a tear drop shape as her new large leathery lips puff and pucker, eager to be penetrated and filled. They soon vanish from view as her tail grows; the hair hiding her entrance and taking on the same shade as her mane. She panted as her transformation finished; exhausted she collapses in a heap smiling as she manages to mutter a thank you to Epona.<br />
<br />
“Did you see how big her lady bits got,” Tim grinning; the tent in in pants showing arousal as his thirteen year old body reacted to the obvious sexual attraction to females.<br />
“You boys,” Cindy scowling; not amused at how immature the boy scouts they met are. “Always trying to look at our special flower.”<br />
“While you girls are all fascinated with our dicks,” Malcom giving the girl a side eye look; &quot;Its as if you have penis envy.&quot; their bickering and name calling distracted them from observing Pegasus transforming.<br />
<br />
Just like Zoey, the stallion began moan and cry as his vision went white. Unable to stay on his hooves, the stallion buckled and collapsed to the ground; Fortunately Marcus was there to help steady his herd brother and guide him to the ground; allowing Pegasus lay on his side.<br />
“It’s not as painful as you described,” Pegasus managing to speak as arms began to form as his neck barrels and swells to take on a human torso form. His skin bright and pink, muscles ripple as body hair grows to form a luscious patch of dark chest hair teasing his new pectorals. Broad shoulders supporting a thick neck and a handsome visage now sporting a short goatee style beard. Pegasus opens his pale green eyes just as a crew cut of dark hair covers his head; it was in stark contrast to the creamy yellow mane running down his human back and matching tail.<br />
<br />
Marcus smiles as he sees the joy coming from Pegasus, “welcome to the Haras my herd brother.”<br />
“Thank you,” Pegasus still smiling as he passes out.<br />
Marcus wonders if this was mandatory for the change; new organs, muscles and limbs requiring new nerve connections. ‘The brain needs rebooting to handle the new inputs,’ Marcus thinking as he helps Pegasus to rest.<br />
<br />
“I guess we missed the newest change,” Ben trotting back to the group; behind him was Lucy moving a slight slower and feeling a bit bloated. Marcus spotted his fellow herd brother and instantly knew that Ben mated with Lucy; making himself one with the Haras. Lucy herself had a peaceful countenance as she walked up towards him and June. June instantly knew based on Lucy’s smell that she was now complete, they hugged in a warm friendly embrace before the two crouched down to wake up Zoey.<br />
“Ben help me out here,” Marcus looking at Pegasus; “He is heavier than he looks.”<br />
“We all are,” Ben effortlessly gliding through the children as he approached; crouching down, Ben absently flicks his tail as if to swat away a fly. Giving all the children a fleeting view of his massive balls swinging and looking empty after a moment of passion.<br />
“Come on Pegasus,” Ben tapping the newest Centaur stallion’s face; “wake up now.”<br />
<br />
“Oi!”<br />
Both Ben and Marcus look up to see Zoey already standing up on her new legs; feeling a bit shaky still as she quickly gets used to walking on hooves.<br />
“Let me get him up,” She states taking a few steps forward; “he and I have and evening to get to know each other better.”<br />
“Only if you are up to it,” Pegasus managing to speak as he slowly comes too; “The change was almost pleasant. Our Goddess’s powers are getting stronger.”<br />
“Then up and at em,” Zoey looking at her former steed; now an amazing specimen of Stallion hood, worthy of siring many foals in her. She already feels her newly formed marehood quivering at the thought of mating; swishing her tail as Pegasus easily gets up on his hooves he already hugs her. Getting her head to rest on his hairy chest, Zoey couldn’t help but giggle at how his chest hairs tickle her face.<br />
“You look lovely,” Pegasus getting a good look at Zoey’s new equine half; “an Australian Brumby.”<br />
“A wild feral breed,” Zoey feeling bliss as Pegasus continues to bury her face in his chest hair. “With russet red brown fur and a dark brown mane and matching tail, right?”<br />
“Right on the fur,” Pegasus letting Zoey go; “but your mane and tail are silvery white.”<br />
“I can work with that,” Zoey smiling; “once we are established better, I want to dye my hair back to what it was when I was a university freshman.”<br />
“Oh great,” Jenny shaking her head; “the purple streak is about to ride again.”<br />
“And better than ever,” Zoey beaming; “so hurry up and get all horsey so we can have a wild romp together.”<br />
“Not in front of the children,” Chris approaching; eliciting a few groans as some wanted a chance to spy on some centaurs getting frisky. “And once Jenny and Sandy change,” Chris turning to the assembled children; “it off to bed as it is getting late.”<br />
“But we want to change,” a few start groaning.<br />
“You will,” Chris calming them all down; “but you will be in a deep sleep as Epona makes sure your transformation is painless. I wouldn’t be surprised if you all experience a shared dream as you become centaur foals;” Chris adds with a smile.<br />
<br />
Chris walks towards were Jenny and Sandy are; noticing that Jenny is completely barefoot and thanks to his keen sense of smell, naked as her womanhood was clearly feeling aroused however safely concealed thanks to the large tunic June gave her earlier. Giving Jenny a comforting smile he turns his gaze to his former steed Sandy.<br />
“Well my friend,” Chris giving Sandy one final neck rub; “after tonight we will be herd brothers, equals.”<br />
“I will miss our rides,” Sandy shaking his head as he tries to rein in his excitement.<br />
“Not necessarily,” Chris smiling; “we just now run and gallop together in the open fields when needing the let loose excess energy.”<br />
“I would like that,” Sandy nodding; “Jenny I am ready if you are.”<br />
“By Epona’s will then,” Jenny nodding to Sandy and to Chris, deciding to sit on the ground; “We are ready to become members of the haras my goddess.”</p>
