<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">HONK HONK! <br />
<br />
&quot;See ya later boys, Go beat up some fags for me while on the way back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Christian and his cruisers laughed out loud, deep boyish voices Echoing across the Neighbourhood as he waved goodbye to them and parked his motorcycle in the garage when---<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah you stupid kids be playing on my lawn ag---?&quot; Nick scratched his grubby belly with his free hand while holding a beer can on the right. &quot;What the fuck are ya doin Son---?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick paused the thought, as his body shuddered as it sunk and shrink back to his lean surfer frame as he de-aged a couple of years back to the young man he once was. <br />
<br />
Memories of being himself flew back into him as the disgusting old man persona disappeared out of existence, clothes reshaping back to their original ways.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck---?&quot; Christian scowled, as he observed his old man turning into a flamboyant skater as he showed complete disgust for the faggot he turned into, he was about to lunge at em, if it wasn&#39;t the time of the day.<br />
<br />
Christian wobbled as he made his lunge and fell flat. His pompadour all messed up and returned back to its original state as his body returned to their normal, non-slick , ordinary teenage ways.<br />
<br />
His clothing re-morphed themselves into an ordinary pair of jeans and shirt that didn&#39;t show off anything spectacular like what Nick has described. His face lost its scowl and returned back to the clueless teen expression he now carried.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck just happened??!!!&quot; The 18 year old kid shouted, stunned at what just happened moments ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the Hetero & Homophobic curse. It causes any gay guy who gets aroused to turn into a homophobe and it&#39;s horrible!&quot; Nick shouted, flailing his arms as he hugged himself tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap...so that thing that happened two days ago wasn&#39;t a dream?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Nick looked astonished. &quot;Two days ago?! You mean that---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, when I was in the shopping mall, I was contemplating about my biological Father who had an affair and left my mom, how I grew up without one and wished that I could relive those years once again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christian paused, sighed as he continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;So eventually, I apparently heard a deep...Latino like voice that spoke...something...and I was later age regressed by a couple of years...into a kid called Mark If I could remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jose...&quot; Nick spoke, the Latino homie James turned into. &quot;So you&#39;re telling me that this already happened to you before yesterday as your &#39;father&#39;? That you got---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know! But it really felt weird for the rest of the day, like I wasn&#39;t myself and I was myself again the next morning when I got up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s the case...then thank god we spoke.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, otherwise I&#39;d be pretty clueless right about now....&quot;<br />
&quot;Word of caution, don&#39;t get aroused or you&#39;ll turn.&quot;<br />
&quot;I try, but you&#39;re really cute though.&quot;<br />
&quot;Awww.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick hugged the gay young man, comforting him as the both of them were glad they had this confrontation.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a nice ass.&quot;<br />
&quot;Haha! That&#39;s what my friends at school like to say.<br />
&quot;Your greaser friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hahahahaha, the both of them exploded in laughter. Having a light hearted laugh despite the circumstances they are in.<br />
<br />
&quot;But anyways, we need to find James. He&#39;s also another one of us. I&#39;ll text him with the number I had when we were Jock Bros.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick hastily searched his phone and was calling James.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright we can use my car and---&quot; PUMP THUMP WHUMP. The car was faulty and leaky down below. &quot;Crap it sprung some leak! Must be when I was a greaser...this is gonna take a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! Just be quick cause the longer we delay, the more likely we can turn any moment without even realising!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot; Christian said, as he grabbed a wrench from the workbench, bent and made his way down as he scooted and adjusted his body position so he could reach that leak.<br />
<br />
BOOTY SHAKE SHAKE.<br />
<br />
&quot;!&quot; Nick gasped, noticing the sexy movements of the younger teen as it reminded him of when he and Corey were in a strip club and---<br />
<br />
&quot;Who may I be speaking to?&quot;<br />
&quot;James! It&#39;s me! Nick the surfer that you turned into a were-breeder!&quot;<br />
&quot;Breeder? Is this how you describe us heterosexual and proper American Citizens with loving families? May the lord bring down the heavens on you! Shame on you and your filthy Sin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;James&quot; hung up, Nick stared in shock as he watched his number of him turn into &quot;Pastor James Truman&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; Nick whispered under his breath, punching his knee as he found out James turning into a breeder once again. This time apparently one of those freaks bent on religion, Christainity...Or some kind of Catholic??? He never understood---<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah did James call? So what did he say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....&quot; Nick paused, for some reason he wanted to just come clean and tell the kid that James had turned. Yet a part of him feels like he should keep it a secret from Christian, like its to take care of him or something of that sort.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s fine and dandy!&quot; He swung his arm while doing it, his voice exaggerated that last word as though it had some kind of wing to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! We&#39;ll head on over once I&#39;m done with this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick sighed to himself, feeling like a parent all over again like he was twice in a row, hoping the next daddy...Father...whateva! Would at least be sexy and HOT---!<br />
<br />
He felt extremely hot around here, noticing his tan seemingly getting darker and crustier, a tan that can only be obtained when being out bare and out in the sun consistently during his younger days.<br />
<br />
&quot;Musta been when I visited...&quot; He mumbled to himself, trying to piece his thoughts together the way he remembered. As a sexy deep slang accentuated his syllables.  <br />
<br />
His legs were tired, as though he&#39;d been exhausted with time and the wait, muscle tensing up in corporation with the rest of his body. Like they&#39;re Aging through time, like fine wine.<br />
<br />
 He sat down behind on the conveniently placed luxury couch in his garage whilst holding his mind. Blood coursing through his veins, especially the strains, as they THICKENED! <br />
<br />
His glutes and thighs, like they belonged to an older male. His butt adjusting to the comfortable seat as though he hadn&#39;t sat down in centuries, adjusting comfortably as they expanded and thickened like they&#39;re meant to be cushioned like he&#39;s a VIP.<br />
<br />
He let himself go, resting nicely on the sofa, letting his arms trail everywhere as he felt a nice treasure trail up his abs, though it felt like they seem to be softer. He knew he ain&#39;t no jock, but still...<br />
<br />
Regardless, he let his arms rest on the THUNK! &quot;A wooden table?&quot; He turned and saw an old remote control on it, something no businessman would buy, and something that was only kept out of tradition. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-When in tarnation was this here---?!&quot;<br />
&quot;Is everything fine?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nuthin, just hurry up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Christian on the other hand felt exceedingly concerned, yet his body told him to continue doing the job. Like he had to not interrupt what was going on yet.<br />
<br />
Nick was controlling himself badly as he let his right arm flung out and FIST! slam the hard wooden desk, it sufficing damages from constant slamming as though he did it when he got stressed.<br />
<br />
His left hand clutching the remote, flicked it on and a small television popped at the top of the ceiling of the garage for some reason, like a reminder to simpler times as it flicked on and displayed horse riding, boy he bet he&#39;d get buffer if number 3 won---<br />
<br />
GIDDYUP!<br />
<br />
His arms toughened with his correct bet, developing thicker arms with stronger and daddier biceps as they take on a confident executive&#39;s build, being a stoke broker when he was starting out always gave him the charm when it comes to betting. <br />
<br />
His shoulders widened, being firmer and more direct in his decisions and choices. Wiser and more intelligent as his back expanded more to fit the bigger space provided to him on his luxurious couch as he sunk down and---<br />
<br />
THUMP! The TV turned off.<br />
<br />
His fists clenched in rage, gruff and roughening with age and strain, with fingers being really experienced in typing away in the computer. He His big and meatier fingers SLAMMED DOWN on the wooden desk once more and threw away the useless remote.<br />
<br />
&quot;GO GIT IT FIXED!&quot; <br />
<br />
Nick got up and stomped his right foot. Letting them expand huge and wide like he means BUSINESS! Reaching a powerful and dominant size 12.5 as he crushed his former sandals down to the dust, like any competitor would.<br />
<br />
Feeling really irritated like if he never got the deal he wanted from a client. He adjusted to a towering height of six feet 2, STRETCHHHHING his torso and length as he stared down over the worker, like as though he was the boss and he&#39;s supervising his child.<br />
<br />
His legs and arms kept itching, scratching them furiously as tons of hair strands pop up equal in stress to his new age of forty. Much more appropriate for someone who belonged to his Long-lasting partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay sheesh...just a few more tweaks and---?&quot; Christian stopped, didn&#39;t Nick sound really strange just nowWait, what&#39;s what---?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have time to play with yer&#39; games Son!&quot; <br />
Nick scratched his neck and chest irritably, feeling older and greyer brownish hairs pop up as his frame, once lean and defined like a surfer, began adding a little extra weight as it completed his overall new body build.<br />
<br />
Older and maturer , but it made the surfer aggravated through midlife crisis, build being firm and steady , with a galloping strong dose of corporate testosterone to his pecs-arms-legs like never before. Too bad his abs were buried with age.<br />
<br />
&quot;But they were THERE JUS NOW! BUT...BUT...THEY&#39;RE NUTHIN&#39; compared to what AH once had when AH was a youngin&#39;!&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt newly non existing threads wrap around his new barrel of a chest, wrestling it as it fit a tight white dress shirt over his way manlier chest. As it crawled down his Southern-Tan all the way to his wrists as it sported a gold Rolex watch.<br />
<br />
A pair of blue silky robes draped over his back as his burly arms adjusted the suit jacket, as his new more masculine and matured fingers fiddled with a red tie with a cross symbol at the top like it was church on Sunday.<br />
<br />
He watched as the room spun into many proportions, old plain looking items became western and southern with tons of ropes, rodeo trophies and tons of prized guns for any man&#39;s collection.<br />
<br />
Men liked cars, especially straight guys, but not everybody could afford a LIMOUSINE! As it shot up marvellously from Christian&#39;s old car, startling the poor kid and confusing the new believer in Christ. <br />
<br />
Gospel music, those that all the bible belts worship, echoed throughout the Country Garage. They&#39;re soothing and changing his mind as his old homosexual ways are coming to an end.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...Ah ain&#39;t a het...ah ain&#39;t Hetero...&quot;<br />
&quot;What the???! Nick! You&#39;re---&quot;<br />
&quot;STOP DILLYDALLYING! MONEY IS WASTIN&#39; !&quot;Nick shouted, feeling his eyes open wide briefly before once again shutting it tight as he clutched his throbbing noggin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot; Christian turned around, seeing his dad-No! Nick in pain! He wasn&#39;t his dad but why...does it seem so right? That the surfer never existed and instead was his old man? Come on Christian...remember! Yeah!<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick was...was...a hot surfer! Yeah! He was so your type! And he was gay---Wait gay? But---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ARGHHHH!&quot; Nick bellowed, clutching his left hand as a golden crest began materializing on his finger. It spread in a loop around and engraved the word &quot;Gospel&quot; in pure gold. Fully forming Nick&#39;s wedding.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! AH refuse to believe AH WAS...GAY!&quot; Nicholas kept stomping on the floor with his right foot. Pain unleashed as anger, especially when he got wrecked by the new laws which was against his beliefs.<br />
<br />
&quot;AH! WOULD NOT BE CURSED!&quot; He spoke,  though somewhere in the back of his head portrayed irony. Regardless, determination began fixing his lewd bareness. Makin&#39; sure curses to be gone and him to be free.<br />
<br />
His strength and force mashed up the cheap material on his feet, letting them turn sturdier and harder-made of a more concrete leather as they wrapped in the made in Texas glory around his larger, more weathered feet.<br />
<br />
His shorts draped over his hairier and huger legs, thigh muscle hidden under layer of fat.<br />
His new tight blue pants spun and hugged nicely on his ankles, sprouting white threads after thread---SOCKS! On his feet. <br />
<br />
The smooth silky threads accentuated while  his everyday movements gained a southern Texas flair to em. Maintaining themselves so they won&#39;t catch the homo as a Bible Belt tightened around his waist with a golden buckle similar to those on his fancy cowboy boots.<br />
<br />
Dress shoes and loafers were his style too! Conservative and traditional, His hair completely slicked all the way back with rich Gospel-made pomade his company sold. Always kept it rich and firm during all nighters.<br />
<br />
Eyebags sufficed slightly, from making all those late night deals with his clients. Anything to make money as they say! His facial features sharpened, as his jaw squared and hardened, gotta be presentable as the CEO of his company.<br />
<br />
His eyebrows furrowed, becoming thicker and more stylish like genetics made it. Side burns allowed to be grown and groomed just so he can look really presentable in front of his colleagues of both genders. <br />
<br />
&quot;But of course something would be wrong if guys got attracted to me...&quot; His body shuddered, pheromones raising over the roof and his former self bending over to the heterosexual religious dominance.<br />
<br />
Developed with years under the father&#39;s roof back in Texas, USA. Meeting the lucky lady whom became his wife and assisting in maintaining his son&#39;s beliefs when he&#39;s away for months on trips with his fellow rich and wealthy businessmen.<br />
<br />
A proud father and a powerful cooperate CEO-that would be him. &quot;It would definitely be something wrong!&quot; He bellowed haughtily, with an arrogant mighty flair. &quot;If ah wasn&#39;t faithful to my beautiful Wife!&quot;<br />
<br />
His mind nearly agreeing it completely, shuddering less intense as he opened his eyes slowly, revealing the dazzling light blue that showed nothing but the love of his family and company. <br />
<br />
Especially with the thoughts of his loving wife, he was without a doubt made curse-free. A holy cross pinned itself over his suit&#39;s breast pocket, Nicholas Gospel smiled, as he stretched his aching back and patted his belly.<br />
<br />
Oh those glory days, when he was young. But now his stomach did pouch slightly. Being away mostly for business trips with all those luxurious five star cuisines, how was a man supposed keep his firm six pack dangit! <br />
<br />
Though from all that , it was still pretty firm, yeah. His back and butt still remained firm over the years , along with his pair of sturdy and thick arms too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha! Musta&#39; been all the times Ah&#39;ve been in the rodeo when AH was young.&quot; He squinted his eyes as he let a deep drawl. <br />
<br />
&quot;All the glory for being a man in the gospel family!&quot; He spoke with tongue. All the glory to God for that he remained handsome and successful even till now. &quot;Praise Jesus HALLELUJAH!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God bless America...God bless the Gospel Family name.&quot;</p>
