<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thanksgiving had finally arrived and although Katie and the others were coming home, the sisters were still not on speaking terms.<br />
<br />
Katie and the others had returned Wednesday night (The perks of having a magic necklace meant not having to worry about holiday traffic). When everyone arrived Samantha finally broke the news of her engagement. Showing of her ring (a magically enhanced ring pop that would not break or grow stale) the ithers gave the couple looks of curiousity anf amusement. Gloria had watched the events unfold, Samantha giving her a knowing smirk. The others were overjoyed and decided to go out, magically ageing themselves old enough to go to the bar.<br />
<br />
Thanksgiving morning Gloria found her home quite busy as her parents prepared dinner. Gloria was puzzled as her parents appeared preoccupied with something besides holiday preparations. &quot;Everyrhing okay,&quot; Gloria asked as her parents looked at eachother nervously. &quot;We&#39;re fine sweety,&quot; Jason said. &quot;Just have alot on our mind.&quot; Gloria looked her parents over critically, not quite believing them. <br />
<br />
Thanksgiving dinner would see the family together with Ann and Lisa&#39;s parents. Gloria had met the elderly couple less than her aunt over the years. Although their relationship with Lisa was somewhat strained that didn&#39;t appear ro be the issue. Gloria hoped that dinner could pass quietly.<br />
<br />
By one dinner was ready and the gueata were begining to arrive. Dinner that night would include Lisa, Jason, Katie, Gloria and Lisa&#39;s parents. The gathering was purposely small and would not include Kellie. Lisa asked that for now Kellie and her family not come over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Gloria can you get the door,&quot; Lisa asked as she stood over the stove. Gloria happily opened the door to see Ann smiling, a bottle of wine in hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Gloria Happy Thanksgiving,&quot; she smiled. Gloria smiled in return taking the wine and Anns jacket. &quot;Good to see you Ann,&quot; she said. &quot;How was the drive?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh it was murder,&quot; Ann sighed. The blond woman quickly cgecked her cellphone, smirking impishly. &quot;Everything okay,&quot; Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah its just Jackie,&quot; Ann grinned. &quot;We&#39;ve been texting back and forth since my last visit. She found out I was coming this weekend and wants to hangout.&quot; Ann laughed softly as she shook her head. &quot;Is it sad that my closest friend is a 14 year old girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Gloria chuckled. &quot;I think its nice you two get along so well. Jackie has really embraced parts of the goth look since you visited. She&#39;d be thrilled to hear you consider her a friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann smiled as she glanced around the home. &quot;Probably means I&#39;m going to need that ring of yours later,&quot; she whispered. Gloria smiled, assuring Ann that when they had time she would make sure Ann had a chance to hangout with Jackie.<br />
<br />
Before either Gloria or Ann could sit they heard another knock at the door. Ann, Lisa and Gloria anxiously looked at it before turning to face eachother. &quot;Is that mom and dad,&quot; Ann asked cautiously. Lisa nodded as she slowly made her way towards the door. &quot;Most likely,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You know how timely dad is. He said they would be here around one so..&quot; The two adults now anxiously stared at the door, trying to compose themselves.  Lisa took a deep breath before slowly opening the door. &quot;Hi mom, hi dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria looked at the elderly couple standing on the front porch. Marrin O&#39;Toole was tall with thinning hrey hair and glasses a quiet smile etched on his wrinkled, distinguished face. Marilyn O&#39;Toole was shorter, standing around Ann&#39;s height with grey hair and an occasional red streak mixed in. Looking her two daughters over critically she adjusted her glasses. &quot;Ann I didnt kmow you were coming,&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah mom Lisa invited me to dinner this year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn nodded as she looked at her youngest daughter. &quot;Wish you had told me Lisa,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I would of brought a gift for her as well.&quot; Marilyn reached into her purse, producing a small gift for Lisa. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom you didnt need to give me anything,&quot; Lisa sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense,&quot; Marilyn snorted. &quot;When your invited to someones home you offer a gift. I know I raised you better than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann surpressed a giggle, as Lisa grit her teeth. Sensing his youngest was about to lose her temper Martin stepped forward, hugging both Ann and Lisa. &quot;So happy you invited us,&quot; he said quickly. &quot;I don&#39;t get to see you two as often as I would like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy to see you too Daddy,&quot; Ann said warmly, to which Lisa rolled her eyes. Martin noticed Lisas expression, smirking at his youngest daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love what youve done with your home Sparky,&quot; he said warmly as he looked at Lisa. Lisa sighed as she looked up at her father. &quot;Thanks dad but do you have to call me Sparky?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry but you&#39;ll always be Sparky to me,&quot; he grinned. Slowly the man turned towards Gloria, smiling at the young teen. &quot;Your mom always hated my nickname for her,&quot; he said. &quot;But unfortunately she was quite the wild one growing up.  Always had so much energy as a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria suppressed a giggle as Lisa sighed. &quot;Cmon dad you have all night to tell embarassing stories about me and Ann,&quot; she groaned. &quot;Why dont you come in and take a seat. Dinner should be ready soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marrin nodded, sloqly limping into the loving room to take a seat on the couch. &quot;By the way where is Katie,&quot; Marilyn asked as she followed Lisa into the kitchen. &quot;She&#39;s visiting some friends she should be home soon,&quot;  Lisa said quickly. &quot;And why are you following me mom. I got dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just trying to help,&quot; Marilyn said defensively. &quot;I planned Thanksgiving dinner for years. Just want to make sure everything is going smoothly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann and Gloria watched as Lisa sighed in frustration. Gloria turned to see her aunt begin to fidget nervously as she watched her sister and mother talk. &quot;Aunt Ann are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann nodded her head, as she nervously began biting her thumb. &quot;Yeah but im pretty sure Mom and Lisa are about to get in another fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom trust me I got this,&quot; Lisa groaned. &quot;You need to trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not a matter of trust Lisa,&quot; Marilyn stated. &quot;Its just I have more experience with cooking than you do. Im more than capable of giving you a hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like you had more experience raising kids,&quot; Lisa grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard that young lady,&quot; Marilyn exclaimed, causing Lisa to curse. &quot;Sorry, sorry,&quot; Lisa exclaimed quickly.<br />
<br />
Marilyn narrowed her eyes as she glared at her daughter. &quot;All these years later and you still let your anger get the best of you,&quot; she stated. &quot;You still blame me and your father for what happened with Kellie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom maybe you shouldn&#39;t go there,&quot; Ann said quickly trying to keep the peace.<br />
<br />
&quot;No its okay,&quot; Lisa said calmly. &quot;This was bound to come out sonner or later. Its best to just get it out the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kitchen went quiet as Lisa now stared at her mother. &quot;Yeah mom I&#39;m still upset with uou about Kellie,&quot; she said. &quot;She got pregnant out of wedlock and you told her you wanted nothing to do with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn sighed as she shook her head sadly. &quot;You have no idea what your talking about,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I wasnt upset because Kellie got pregnant, I got upset because Kellie told us she was gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann and Lisa&#39;s jaws dropped as they stared at their mother. &quot;Kellie was gay!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn sighed sadly as she looked at her daughters. &quot;Yes,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Kellie came to us after she got pregnant and came out. Your father was willing to accept it but I was completely caught off guard. I....I didn&#39;t react well. We got into a fight and never spoke again. And to this day it is still the greatest failure Ive had as a parent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann and Lisa continued to stare at their mother who was now wiping tears from her eyes. &quot;Unfortunately Lisa you get your temper and your stubborness from me,&quot; she groaned. &quot;I was too proud and too angry to try to make amends with Kellie before she died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me mom,&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
Marilyn gave a short laugh as she looked at Lisa. &quot;Oh please like you would of listened,&quot; she said. &quot;You dont see it Lisa but you are exactly like I am. Your stubborn, emotional,  and have a hell of a temper. It amazes me to this day your father has stuck around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria watched as her mom and her family now began to talk amongst themselves. A secret that no one knew had been revealed. After so many years Gloria wondered if these old wounds could be healed. Little did she realize that the Ring of Age was now trying to heal those woumds</p>
