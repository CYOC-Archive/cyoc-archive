<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian tried to ignore his inner dread. &quot;I'll go. Thank you. Where do you live?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elaenae looked at Brian. &quot;You must really have amnesia. You don't recognize me, do you?&quot; Brian had no idea how to react to that. He shook his head. &quot;Well, you're in for a pleasant surprise. Let's go.&quot; She extended her hand. Brian took it and began to take steps. Elaenae stayed where she was, instead closing her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goest laeveckto us pouteck zao fak voifteirous!&quot; After Elaenae finished that sentence, Brian was enveloped by intense heat and blinding light. It wasn't at all painful, in fact it was extremely pleasant. It felt like every molecule in his body was vibrating. He vaguely felt his body disintegrate as the warming sensation hit its apex. Eventually, the sensations died away as his elven body reintegrated on grassy ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;That felt great...&quot; Brian moaned, facing the soft earth. He could tell that he was no longer in the enchanted forest, because he was on a well-manicured field of grass and the sun was out. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I cast a teleportation spell. We are at my home,&quot; Elaenae said. Brian flipped himself over and nearly swallowed his tongue. The &quot;home&quot; in front of him was actually a gigantic stone castle. It was about four stories tall, with a moat and drawbridge, horse stables, and large, strong guards in front of the main doors.<br />
<br />
Brian scrambled to his feet. &quot;This is where you live?!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Who...who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elaenae smirked. &quot;You can call me Princess Elaenae. My mother and father rule the entire elven nation.&quot; Brian's head was swimming now, and not just due to his head injury. Looking back, he could see that this castle was at the top of a large hill, with a large village below. Thanks to his strong eyesight, he could see many elves, large and small, going about their daily lives. &quot;Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.&quot; After a few moments Brian snapped out of his daze and began to follow the princess into her magnificant palace. With a wide smile, Brian decided that he was going to enjoy this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, princess!&quot; One of the guards greeted Elaenae. He was extremely musclebound, standing about seven feet tall, and holding a humongous sword behind his back in a sheath. Brian mused that it would probably crush him if he tried to lift it, but the guard looked as if he could lift it with a pinky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Faelean. Are my parents in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the guard said. He turned his gaze to me. He scowled. &quot;Who is this?&quot; Brian's face burned. He obviously thought he wasn't even worthy to be looking at this palace. Brian's clothes were scruffy, his feet were bare, and he was a good foot and a half shorter than the guard. Brian felt extremely intimidated. He could be killed in a second and absolutely no one would know or care.<br />
 <br />
&quot;A guest of mine,&quot; Elaenae said, with an undertone of &quot;step off or I'll have you gelded&quot;. The guard did indeed step off, and opened the palace door. Brian felt a little better. The door opened up into a great hall, with many well to-do elves milling about. &quot;Come on,&quot; she said, beckoning Brian up some steps. Brian followed, still in awe at the splendor of the palace. He couldn't help but wonder if Ty was impressed as well, because he knew he was watching, invisible. Elaenae opened up a door and showed Brian in.<br />
<br />
Brian stood in a large room with a bed, walk-in closet, full-length mirror, and even a fireplace. &quot;This is a guest room,&quot; Elaenae told Brian. &quot;There's some clothes in the closet. Why don't you dress up and after that the nurses and I will get you cleaned up. After that you can meet my parents the King and Queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guest room? Brian thought this room was bigger than his house as a human. &quot;Thanks,&quot; was all he could muster. Elaenae smiled at him and closed the door. He was alone. Brian began to undress himself so he could change into the better clothes. While doing so, Brian looked at his new self in the mirror. <br />
<br />
This was the first time he saw his entire elven body. It was a bit of a shock to see an unfamiliar face in a mirror. He looked like an 11 or 12 year old boy that had yet to go through puberty. Apart from the long hair on the top of his head, there was no other hair on his body, arms and legs included. He stood about 5' 4&quot; tall, his long pointed ears contributing to that sum. Yet, he still had a deep voice and his body was well-sculpted with muscles.  Brushing long blond hair out of his face, Brian finally stripped completely naked. He was surprised and somewhat relieved to see that his pride and joy was still that of his former human self, but now, hallelujah, with a foreskin. It certainly looked strange; the lack of hair surrounding it made it look bigger than his old one. Brian couldn't help but giggle. He had to figure out how big it was when erect.<br />
<br />
His hairless body certainly was erotic. Feeling all over his body, his member thickened and began to poke out of his foreskin. The sensation felt alien to Brian, not only because it was without hair, but the skin itself felt slightly different than a human's. Brian smiled at the man in the mirror, clicked his tongue, and pointed. &quot;Lookin' good,&quot; he said. His balls seemed to be a little bigger than he remembered, or maybe his scrotum was a little tighter. Regardless, it felt great. As he had done many times before, his right hand began to move up and down on his shaft. Brian finally stood at a proud seven and a half inches, looking absolutely bizarre on his short stature. He WAS bigger.<br />
<br />
Brian kept on jerking off. The feelings felt so much stronger than when he was a human. Precum began to drip out of his penis. &quot;Oh, oh, oh,&quot; Brian moaned. An internal pressure was building. It literally felt like his balls were vibrating. After what seemed like an eternity, the pressure reached its peak. Brian let out a long moan. At this point he was willing to stay an elf forever, screw real life. A flood of cum flowed out of his dick. In his old form whenever he pleasured himself, he was lucky to get two squirts. This time his shots were monstrous, four footers. Three came out quickly and he had no signs of stopping. &quot;Ohmygodohmygodohmygod,&quot; Brian yelled. He had never felt pleasure like this.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the door burst open and Elaenae burst inside. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; She asked. <br />
<br />
Brian looked up, embarrassed at the princess. Embarrassment gave way to more pleasure. All in all, a good half pint of seed was on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, for the love of...&quot; Elaenae muttered. &quot;Typical male.&quot; In spite of his sexual energy, Brian was suddenly genuinely concerned. She was a princess, and if Brian offended her, she could have unspeakable things done to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sorry...princess...&quot; Brian stammered. He belatedly threw on the clothes he was supposed to wear. They were certainly elegant. Wearing them he would blend in with the rest of the elves in the palace.<br />
<br />
Elaenae rolled her eyes. &quot;Come on. I want you to meet the King and Queen. I'll have someone, &quot; she let out a long annoyed sigh, &quot;clean that up.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brian gulped. Elaenae lead him back down the stairs and through the main hallway into a regal throne room. Impossibly, it seemed bigger than the hallway connected to it. The King and Queen were at the end of the hall. Their faces lit up when Elaenae walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daughter! What a surprise! We weren't expecting you. Who is this?&quot; The king asked. The royal family wore extravagant clothing and robes. They both wore crowns and had jeweled scepters. Clearly they were powerful beings.<br />
<br />
Elaenae slowly gathered a mischievous smirk. My heart began to pound. &quot;This is Brian. I found him...&quot;</p>
