<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...and landed on a &quot;4&quot;. He looked to the notepad list - an Eagle morph.<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated for a moment, selfishly thinking he was not really sure he wanted to go through with that choice. Maybe he should start out with something not so drastic. Maybe roll again? But he reminded himself that a roll was a roll, and the fact of the matter was that he really had to try and see if this device was for real. Rather, he&#39;d be more &quot;feathery&quot; than &quot;furry&quot;!<br />
<br />
The Chronivac had taken in Jeff&#39;s physical data and returned his stats on-screen prior to the download of the transformation package, but now was inter-matched with a new set of physical data that resembled what an anthro eagle with Jake&#39;s build would be:<br />
<br />
Name: Jeff Gauthier<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Species: Human ---> Eagle<br />
Age: 16<br />
Height: 5&#39;9&#39;&#39;<br />
Weight: 172<br />
Sexual Orientation: Bisexual<br />
<br />
A title blinked on top, &quot;Recommended Settings&quot;; The species bar seemed to be locked in, with the bar for the species and sexual orientation set at 50%. However, he could change his gender, age, height and weight at will. So he took off a few pounds as he always found himself to be a bit on the flubby side for his age and didn&#39;t think it would look too good on an eagle. He also set the height bar to a solid 6 feet.<br />
<br />
Beyond these statistics were options to alter and change each detail from quill and feather color and pattern, length and height, stance, beak, wings, tailfeathers, legs, toes and talons, eye size, eye color, beak length and color... the list kept going on and on and on and on... the detail was mind-boggling. Considering that everything was in numbers with the slider bars, he figured that it was more important to see if this thing really worked or not and decided to leave mostly everything as their default stats. <br />
<br />
After scrolling through what seemed like for ages were some required response check-offs. &quot;Pleasurable transformation?&quot; -- Hell yes, he said to himself. &quot;Don&#39;t remember transformation after reset (WARNING: lose memory of whole transformation period)&quot; -- which he left unchecked for obvious reasons. &quot;Multiple transformations for area?&quot; -- was also left unchecked. &quot;(Package Request) Retain human penis/vagina?&quot; -- was a bit hilarious at first to Jeff, but he unchecked it as he wasn&#39;t sure. Finally, &quot;Perception of reality?&quot; -- he wanted to make sure he remembered the changes he went through, so he checked it. However, the Unaware light was left on, and as this was not in the traditional list of check boxes it had continued to stay on.<br />
<br />
He took another nervous look at the clock. He changed the duration of transformation to 5 minutes, but left the transformation period setting at 1 hour. After all this work, and with a deep inhale and exhale, he clicked the &quot;enter&quot; button. <br />
<br />
And waited.<br />
<br />
A few seconds went by and nothing happened. &quot;Great,&quot; Jeff murmured. &quot;I want a glass of water.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just after he finished that sentence, a weird feeling came over him, starting at his feet and legs. It was like his feet were being pushed up from the middle and curving outward - and it didn&#39;t feel all that good in his shoes - so he ripped off his shoes and socks to get a better look. They didn&#39;t look all that different.<br />
<br />
But something was happening... something was DEFINITELY happening. They looked almost scrawny, and nothing but bone. And as he kept looking at his feet, he could see them change and exaggerate. &quot;Holy crap.&quot; It was so weird, but it was so cool, and he was definitely getting turned on by it. The feeling of his legs was different too; they were less rubbery and hairy, and felt kinda rough and hard. They were losing definition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this really --&quot;, he said, then stopped when he felt his jaw lock up. He knew right away - it was all happening so fast now, so suddenly; the feeling of his mouth and the front of his face were going numb. He couldn&#39;t talk all that well for a few moments - that&#39;s when he turned to the mirror suddenly - and he could see. It looked like a beak, although not all that big - was pushing out from between his lips and actually pushing his nose up and back - leaving no trace of his teeth or his gums. His eyes grew wide at the sight. The transformation was working!<br />
<br />
His belly rumbled, and another wave of vertigo-like pleasure corrupted his sight. &quot;This is definitely a pleasure&quot;, he thought to himself. He knew his dick was starting to crawl up and it was calling to him badly...  but the rest of his body was starting to get itchy too. He could see the beginnings of what would be his feathers - and they were sprouting all over his chest and arms; Wow... especially his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shiht!&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when his sister came running and knocked at the door. Hard. &quot;No swearing! I&#39;m gonna tell mom!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nahhh - dahn&#39;t cahm in,&quot; he managed to curl his mouth to shout. But sisters will be sisters, and she took this as an open invitation to unjam the lock on the door and fling it open.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat in horror as the changes continued and his sister looked in from the hall. He thought it was going to be over...</p>
