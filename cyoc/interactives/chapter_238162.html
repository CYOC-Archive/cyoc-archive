<br />
Andromeda and Nyx had arrived back to the Tepes home a few days ago after visiting their uncle Duke and aunt Sasha as well as secretly visiting Chase Moreland and Aaron Harris. Andromeda was her usual smiling self when they returned, but the Tepes family and the staff were surprised when Nyx arrived back with a more positive attitude. It especially seemed unlike Nyx when she arrived at breakfast early one morning along with the rest of her family when she was usually the last to arrive.<br />
<br />
“Good morning mother, good morning daddy.” Nyx greeted Kyra and Wyatt as she kissed both of them on the cheek. Nyx then sat down and ate her breakfast as her siblings looked at her with surprise.<br />
<br />
“This can’t really be our sister, right? The usually moody one who hates getting up early in the morning?” Brendan asked any of his relatives at the table.<br />
<br />
“It certainly looks like her, but she’s so....happy this morning.” Andrew pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Nyx, it is you, isn’t it? You’re not like possessed or anything?” Duncan asked his sister.<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t be silly Duncan, of course it’s me. I just got up and thought I should arrive early to eat breakfast with my wonderful family.” Nyx answered her brother.<br />
<br />
“This has to be a prank, right? Some kind of set up or something. Did you do something to my room? Are you trying to get back at me for that prank I pulled on you before the ball? You are, aren’t you? Well you can’t fool a prankster, I’ll find what you did!” Duncan said as he ran off to his room.<br />
<br />
“Mother, I think we should go out to the garden today and pick out some flowers like we used to when I was little.” Nyx suggested to her mother with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Nyx, you really want to? You haven’t asked to do that with me in such a long time, I think I might cry. You know what? The rest of my breakfast can wait, come on, let’s go pick some flowers.” Kyra said standing up as Nyx stood up with her.<br />
<br />
“Maybe you could also make a flower crown for me too.” Nyx said Kyra gave her daughter a loving smile as the two left the dining area.<br />
<br />
“Aw, that’s so sweet, I’m glad Nyx is feeling so happy.” Andromeda said with a smile as she watched her mother and sister leave the room and continued with her breakfast.<br />
<br />
“Yes it seems so. This wouldn’t happen to have anything to do with that boy she danced with back at the ball does it?” Wyatt asked his daughter as she ate her food before answering.<br />
<br />
“Well, I mean...she had a rather....exciting time, and that boy....really swept her off her feet.” Andromeda said as she skated around directly answering her father.<br />
<br />
“I suppose he did. Now I had heard from some of the young vampire men that the boy she was with was a kitsune. Do you happen to know if that’s true?” Wyatt asked as Andromeda gulped her food down.<br />
<br />
“Well daddy, I...I actually wasn’t near her, so I can’t really confirm if the boy was a kitsune or not.” Andromeda answered hoping her father wouldn’t ask any further questions.<br />
<br />
“I see, and what about you? Who did you dance with? I thought the boy I saw you dance with looked somewhat familiar, but I can’t place the face.” Wyatt said rubbing his chin.<br />
<br />
“He was....he was just a....very....nice boy daddy, that’s all.” Andromeda replied while blushing.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, well maybe your mother and I should meet him.” Wyatt suggested.<br />
<br />
“NO! Uh...I mean....I don’t know if he’ll respond to my request daddy, he’s....busy with his family at the moment and can’t be reached. Anyway, I’ve finished my breakfast, so I’ll excuse myself daddy.” Andromeda said as she bowed her head and stood up from the table and left before her father left any more questions.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Nyx and her mother were in the garden picking flowers, the vampire princess was humming to herself as she twirled a plucked rose in her hand. She didn’t even notice when Kyra placed a flower crown on her.<br />
<br />
“This mysterious young man must be quite the charmer to have you all misty eyed.” Kyra commented.<br />
<br />
“What? I-I’m not misty eyed. I’m just…happy is all. He’s a really great guy.” Nyx replied turning her head so her mother couldn’t see her blush.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Nyx, I understand how you feel, I was the same way when I first met your father.” The vampire queen said, “You and your siblings are growing up so fast now, you know how protective your father is, especially after what happened with the Morelands all those years ago.”<br />
<br />
“I know mother. It’s just, when I’m with him it’s like…it’s like all that those bad things that happened to me disappear.” The black haired girl said.<br />
<br />
“I’m happy that you’ve met someone. May I at least ask what his name is?” Kyra asked.<br />
<br />
“Aaron. His name is Aaron.” Nyx replied dreamily.<br />
<br />
“Aaron…curious, that’s not a normal Kitsune name.”<br />
<br />
“It isn’t? I’ve never met a Kitsune before:” Nyx replied.<br />
<br />
“It’s nothing, don’t worry about it sweetheart.” Kyra said, hiding her concern.<br />
<br />
Kyra smiled and hugged her daughter.<br />
<br />
Andromeda had been busy with other duties and wanted to rest in her bedroom, but as she approached her bedroom, she suddenly heard one of her classic albums by that lady Taylor Swift, and it was the song ‘Love Story’ playing. But what surprised her more, was that she was hearing her sister singing along with it.<br />
<br />
Andromeda slowly and quietly opened up her bedroom door to see Nyx with her back to the door as she was holding her stuffed vampire cat and singing to it.<br />
<br />
“Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone, I’ll be waiting, all there’s left to do is run, You’ll be the prince and I’ll be the princess, It’s a love story, baby, just say......shit.” Nyx said as she turned around at the last part and was embarrassed when she saw her sister standing at the door with a big smile on her face.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Nyxie Pixie, it makes me so happy to see you so in love.” Andromeda said as she went over and gave her sister a big hug.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you dare tell Duncan I was singing to one of your Swift albums, or I’ll never hear the end of it.” Nyx asked her sister.<br />
<br />
“I swear I won’t. But the song’s pretty appropriate considering who we’re seeing.” Andromeda mentioned.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god, don’t compare us to Romeo and Juliet, none of us are anything like that.” Nyx said rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Really? Maybe you can recount what the story’s about to me.” Andromeda said raising her eyebrow towards her sister.<br />
<br />
“Well it’s about two people from two different families that are enemies with each other, but they fall in love and....have to....keep it secret from their families. Oh, fuck me, I’m Juliet. I hope our stories don’t end the same way.” Nyx groaned.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Nyxie, papà knew Shakespeare, he was drunk the whole time writing it!” A cheery voice called.<br />
<br />
The sisters looked at Izzy as she skipped towards them.<br />
<br />
“And you are?” Nyx asked.<br />
<br />
“Nyx, don’t be rude to our guest. This is Princess Isabella Salecio D’ombra di Venezia. She’s Lord Marcelo D’ombra’s daughter.” Andromeda informed her sister.<br />
<br />
“Right. Were you listening in on us?” Nyx asked.<br />
<br />
“Not exactly—I mean I was just passing by when I overheard you two, I have really good hearing I guess. Papà says I always hear things I’m not supposed to.” The strawberry blonde explained.<br />
<br />
“Are you wearing one of my old dresses?” The black haired princess then asked.<br />
<br />
“Y-yea, your mom said I could borrow it. It’s a little…much I know.” Izzy replied.<br />
<br />
“Tell me about it, I can’t believe I used to wear that kind of stuff.” Nyx said.<br />
<br />
“I heard from one of the maids that you had requested new dresses, more pretty ones to look good for your boyfriend.” Andromeda revealed.<br />
<br />
Nyx’s face went red and she tried to stop her sister from continuing but Andromeda managed to keep her back.<br />
<br />
“Come on Nyx, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about, I’m happy Aaron has brought you out of your moody shell.” The brown haired sister continued.<br />
<br />
“Hehe. You’re so cute together! I never had a sister, the only fights I’ve had were with my brothers—and those usually involved broken furniture and stuff hehe.” Izzy giggled.<br />
<br />
“Really. How many brothers do you have again?” Andromeda asked as they all sat down in the bed.<br />
<br />
“Twelve, there’s: Marcelo Jr., Matteo, Eduardo, Rocco, Nuvola, Draco, Dante, Tullio, Gianni, Leo, Angelo, and Vigo.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa, your mother must be…exhausted.” Andromeda said blushing.<br />
<br />
“Well we don’t all have the same madre. Papà gets around, he kind of has that reputation. Vigo, Nuvola, Draco and Dante and I have the same madre; Rosa Spina D’ombra Di Roma.“ Izzy explained.<br />
<br />
“And I thought our family was complicated.” Nyx added.<br />
<br />
“So where’s Andrew’s room again. I completely forgot I was going to see him.” Izzy asked.<br />
<br />
“Wait, are you going out with Andrew?!” Andromeda gasped.<br />
<br />
“What? No! Of course not! He and I are just friends…besides I’m more interested in…u-uh well I should go.” Izzy stammered and quickly excused herself.<br />
<br />
“Wait! Andrew’s room is past the hall to the right!” Andromeda shouted.<br />
<br />
“R-Right, thanks!” The blonde shouted back.</p>
