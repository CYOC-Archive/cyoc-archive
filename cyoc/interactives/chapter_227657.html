<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The idea is an ommage to the story  &quot;The right settings&quot; by RoidTeen <br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
...<br />
I signed for the package and spotted a note stuck to my door, an invitation for a dorm party later tonight and took that inside too. There was no recipient name just the room number, but it said it was from TransDem Labs. Could it be? I opened it up and couldn&#39;t believe my luck, a Chronivac! I didn&#39;t think they were even real! This opened up a million possibilities.<br />
I had to have a normal life. And if Mike lived here I had an idea. I inputed my thoughts about the change.<br />
--------------------<br />
When I woke up, I did not feel as if he had really slept. I seemed dull and for a moment also disoriented, unsure where I was and who I was at all. Maybe it was because of this strange dream... a nightmare. In this dream I was also 18, but fat with 260 pounds of pure blubber and a gigantic belly. A micro penis of just 2 angry inch. No friends and only food around me. Alone and unhappy.<br />
A sigh passed over my lips and a glance at the alarm clock revealed that it was 6:45. In fact, I had woken up fifteen minutes too early because of that stupid dream. I closed my eyes for a moment, but then got up and went into the bathroom.<br />
Like every morning, the sight in the mirror caused a mixture of emotions. On the one hand, my 6&#39;0&#39;&#39; meter tall figure and my 190 lbs were an indication of how I was a healthy boy, not too thin, not too fat. And the large cock hanging between my legs was the crowning jewel of my physique. I had 4 ½ inch when I was fully erect and it wsa the average, not too bad I would say.<br />
Suddenly, the door is opened. I could hardly turn around when already a familiar voice said, &quot;Tony! You stupied bastard. Turn the alarm off, before I staff you with it!&quot; Mike was staying in the room next to mine, a 6&#39;1&quot; inch, 250 lbs football player, which made him look at the world from above. I switched off the alarm, put my clothes on and left the room. I hated this bastard. He did not understand any word but power. With these thoughts I went to the university, planning to brush my teeth in the bathroom there. When I was back to dorm I heard that Mike was not alone, a specific sound and something like:<br />
&quot;Ahhh, Mike, your big cock feels so good inside me&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why the girls love me, you whore&quot;<br />
I heard Mike moaning, so they were obviously fucking.<br />
I opened my laptop. There were my Chronivac profile. Time to some changes.<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
When Iwoke up, I did not feel as if I had really slept. Iseemed dull and for a moment also disoriented, unsure where I was and who I was at all. Maybe it was because of this strange dream... a nightmare. In this dream my roomate humilates me, because of his size. I was just 6 feet high and 190 lbs with barely seeable abs. But worst of all: my cock was just 4 inch.<br />
A sigh passed over my lips and a glance at the alarm clock revealed that it was 6:45. In fact, I had woken up fifteen minutes too early because of that stupid dream. I closed my eyes for a moment, but then got up and went into the bathroom.<br />
Like every morning, the sight in the mirror caused a mixture of emotions. On the one hand, my 6&#39;5&quot;  tall figure and my 270 lbs was an indicator of how I dedicated my time in gym. And the large cock hanging between my legs was the crowning jewel of my physique. With my 7&quot; fully erect cock. It was the perfect size and made women go crazy.<br />
Suddenly, the door is opened. I could hardly turn around when already a familiar voice said, &quot;Tony, switch off the fucking alarm! I want to sleep!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, good morning Mike,&quot; I replied, switching off the alarm and putting my clothes on.<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s so good about the morning?&quot; He muttered, still half asleep.<br />
I ignored him and went to the gym. After my standard routine I visit showers, drink protein shake and then went to the lections. At the evening I wanted to relax a bit and decided to check some porn. When I opened the door I heard that Mike was not alone, a familiar voice said,<br />
&quot;Ahhh, Mike, your big cock feels so good inside me!&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why the girls love me, you whore&quot; He answered.<br />
It was Jessica, his new chick for a month. <br />
I slamed the door to show that I&#39;m at home and went to kitchen. My chicken and rice could not wait more. After a good dinner I opened my laptop. There was my Chronivac profile. Time to some changes.<br />
---------------------<br />
When Iwoke up, I did not feel as if I had really slept. It seems dull and for a moment also disoriented, unclear where I am and who I am at all. Maybe it was because of the strange dream... a nightmare.<br />
In that nightmare, my roommate, Mike was as big as I was. A sigh passed over my lips and a glance at the alarm clock revealed that it was 6:45. In fact, I had woken up fifteen minutes too early because of that stupid dream.<br />
I closed my eyes for a moment, but then got up and went into the bathroom. Like every morning, the first thing was a scale. 310 lbs. I looked in the mirror. 6&#39;8&quot; tall. Very well defined stud was looking back at me. Not bad.<br />
Suddenly, the door is opened. I could hardly turn around, when a familiar voice said,<br />
&quot;Oh Tony, are you there? Good, because I need a favor. I&#39;m sorry, but would you mind switching off the alarm? I want to sleep a bit.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure, no problem&quot; I replied and started putting my clothes on.<br />
My roomate, Mike. He was one of our cheerleder&#39;s teammeber, who supported our football team. I was a quaterback. He was 6&#39;1&quot; tall and 250 pounds. Quite strong guy. I liked when he giving me a handjob when I want to play. I drank my first protein shake and went to the gym. After that I had a rest till the training session on a university field. When I was back to dorm I heard that Mike was not alone again. A specific sound and something like:<br />
&quot;Ahhh, Mike, your big cock feels so good inside me&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why the girls love me, you whore&quot; Mike moaned in pleasure.<br />
I slammed the door, so he knew that I&#39;m at home. All moaning floated away. I ate my second dinner and opened a laptop. Our trainer told be that I need to add some mass if we want to get the prise this year. It was a shame. There was my Chronivac profile. Time to some changes.<br />

hen Iwoke up, I did not feel as if I had really slept. It seems dull and for a moment also disoriented, unclear where I am and who I am at all. A sigh passed over my lips and a glance at the alarm clock revealed that it was 6:45. In fact, I had woken up fifteen minutes too early because of that stupid dream... a nightmare.<br />
In that nightmare, I was in a football team. One of these small guys. I finished my football cairier when I was in school. I closed my eyes for a moment, but then got up and went into the bathroom. I had to bow my head because door frame was too short for me. I was 8&#39;5&quot; tall and had 450 lbs of pure muscles. 11&quot; cock hang between my legs, all ready for my roommate&#39;s mouth. He liked to do a morning blowjob.<br />
When I was back to my bedroom, the door opened:<br />
&quot;I know, I&#39;m late! I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t set up the alarm, but I am already here.&quot; Mikey was my roommate. 6&#39;1&quot; tall, 250 lbs. I liked to fuck him.<br />
&quot;Get up, go to shower, you have 15 minutes,&quot; I said, and he began to move.He was a good lay. He did a good blowjob, after that he gave my protein shake. It was our morning routine. After lections I forwarded to the gym. There was noone bigger than me. I was the king of the gym.<br />
When I was back to dorm I heard that Mike was not alone again. A specific sound and something like:<br />
&quot;Ahhh, Mike, your big cock feels so good inside me&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why the boys love me, you whore&quot;<br />
Mike was my small neighbor, but for normal people he wasn&#39;t small. It was Jack, his boy for a month.<br />
I slamed the door, so he knew that I&#39;m at home. All moaning floated away. I ate my dinner, Mike served to me, and opened a laptop. I recieved a mail from my coach, he was saying that I needed to bulk up if I want to be in a good shape on Olymia. Time to some changes.<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
When I woke up, I did not feel as if I had really slept. It seems dull and for a moment also disoriented, unclear where I am and who I am at all. Maybe it was because of this strange dream... a nightmare.<br />
In that dream I was 18 years old. And I was very standard competeting young bodybuilder. Just a one from hundreds and thouthends. I felt something on my cock head. It was Mike, the way how this tiny man was working as alarm every day. His lips were trying to swallow my dick head, but it was too thick. When I moaned and came, his belly was full of my semen. He went to the bathroom and was back clean. <br />
&quot;Good morning, titan!&quot; He said &quot;We have to go to the university soon. But breakfast first!&quot;<br />
Mike served a delicious breakfast for me. Chicken breast with mashed potato with my protein shake.<br />
I stood up and hit the ceiling with my head, there wer cracks. Not the first time, hehe. I was 9&#39;4&quot; tall and didn&#39;t stop growing. In the shower he helped me, because I was too wide to clean myself. Than were scale platform. 860 lbs. Aghh.. I need more 40 pounds to reach the next level.</p>
