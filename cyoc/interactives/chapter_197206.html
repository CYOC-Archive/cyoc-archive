<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maureen spent the day as an 8 year old girl. She would have liked to get out of the house but instead had to amuse herself. She actually spent a lot of her time on Liz’s computer reading stories about the ‘Medallion of Zulo’ as they determined the medallion was called. Certainly the medallion appeared to act exactly the same way as the supposedly fictional Medallion of Zulo did.<br />
 ..<br />
Liz appeared to pass the test at Michelle’s house. Certainly the old woman behaved as if she had no doubt Liz was her daughter Maureen. Liz sat through an hour of Michelle or ‘Mum’ as Liz was calling her, reminding her of all her medical issues. It seemed Michelle had developed a lot of problems in the past 15 years. Anyway Michelle made a nice lunch for her ‘daughter’ and wished her the best for the upcoming trip. <br />
<br />
It was 3pm by the time Liz called in to see how the now very young Maureen was going. <br />
<br />
Maureen complained “It’s so boring being stuck inside all day” <br />
<br />
Liz ignored the young girl and told her “I’ve been thinking about Roger. I think you need to be the black eyed version of him again. Become him as soon as you can tonight using the last clothes you wore as him before you became me. By the time I come around here after the real Roger has gone to work tomorrow, the bruise should have faded a fair bit and we can each be ourselves again. If Roger starts the Spanish trip with a bit of a shiner it’s no big deal. We just can’t afford any further mishaps. We both need to get new outfits for ourselves before we leave”<br />
<br />
“In that case, I think you need to use the medallion yourself right now, to get that body back to a size 12” the little girl replied. “If we change back tomorrow I want to go wardrobe shopping straight away. I want to be the correct size”<br />
<br />
“Good point. I’ve been this size for a few days now. And I’ve let it be known about town that I’m on a strict weight loss regime. Let’s do it”<br />
So Liz touched the medallion to the unworn size 12 bodysuit she had bought last week before heading back to the Manning house. She didn’t wait for the changes to complete she lost a further 5 kg on the drive back.<br />
<br />
Roger was actually inside the house sorting through his own wardrobe and deciding what clothes he was going to take to Europe. He did not appear to notice that ‘Maureen’ had lost even more weight. <br />
<br />
Liz attended the barbeque wearing the red dress that had originally changed her into sunburnt Maureen. It was the only size 12 dress she could find. After another shower a lot of the peeling skin had shed and she was starting to look pretty good. Certainly Roger noticed when she appeared in the red dress.<br />
<br />
“Wow! You look really good. I haven’t seen you in that dress in years”<br />
<br />
“It’s nice to be size 12 once more. I had to go searching in the old clothes boxes in the shed to find something that would fit me” said Liz proudly<br />
<br />
“You skin is looking much better as well” commented Roger. He wasn’t lying. This treatment of Liz’s, along with her weight loss had left his wife looking much younger. “You look so young. People will start thinking I’m your sugar daddy”<br />
<br />
“Well we might have to get you looking young and fit as well” Liz replied with a sparkle in her eyes. She was looking forward to Roger also being in his mid thirties once more.<br />
………..<br />
Ginny was also very full of praise about ‘Maureen’s’ weight loss. She found it hard to believe this was the same woman who had gone to the theatre with her only a week and a half earlier. She warned ‘Maureen’ “You look fantastic but can you keep the weight off?”<br />
<br />
“I hope so. We plan to do a lot of walking in Spain. I’m intending to make a habit of it”<br />
<br />
“Keep watching your calories as well. You know how quickly your weight can yoyo”<br />
<br />
“I will”<br />
<br />
“And your skin is not looking nearly as bad as you made out”<br />
<br />
“It’s a lot better now. The peeling has almost finished. I was a beetroot on Thursday. I’m hoping by the time we leave for Spain my skin will be blemish free”<br />
<br />
When they arrived home that night Liz eagerly slipped into the sexy nightgown she had bought. She was eager to enjoy her last night as Mrs Manning.<br />
…….<br />
Maureen found herself falling asleep in front of the TV as she waited for her 12 hours as an 8 year old to finish. Interestingly she found herself absorbed in watching cartoons that were on during the after school time slot. She fell asleep when the news came on. Becoming a kid had noticeably changed her take on what made an interesting TV show.<br />
<br />
She did wake in plenty of time to change back into black eyed Roger. She used the bike pants she had worn the previous time she had become Roger. Very quickly she changed from an 8 year old girl to a 34 year old man with a black eye. <br />
<br />
The underwear Liz had given her was certainly more comfortable but Maureen didn’t bother with the shorts or shirt. As ‘Roger’ he went to Liz’s bed and attempted to sleep. He found himself turned on by the scent of Liz in the room. Then his fingers found the satin nightgown of Liz’s, he had been wearing while in Liz&#39;s body, that had been stowed under the pillow.  <br />
<br />
One thing led to another and before Maureen was aware of what he was doing he was ejaculating into Liz’s sexy satin garment. No wonder Roger was always playing with himself.<br />
<br />
Maureen fell asleep with his cock wrapped in Liz’s nightgown.</p>
