<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He know what he had to do. He had to make the ones who did this suffer, for everything they did to him. For all the bullets they shot at him and all the swords he got slain by for them he had to do this. He grapped the liquid.<br />
<br />
Then again what has the difference. Either way he would be a monster. One who gives up and one who retaliates. It makes no difference to his soul. He&#39;s still a criminal, a spy and a murderer. He deserves death and maybe he&#39;ll kill himself after this. There is no better feeling then death for him right now. And he will quaint that feeling with the drink of eternal darkness. But that paranoia rushed into his head again. What if the elixir killed him? It would be unsactifsory for his family knowing that he died in such a mundane stupid way.  Then again what did he have to lose.<br />
<br />
He took the drink and opened it up. <br />
<br />
Suddenly a dark light flow across the room in such speed and such haste it broke the air around it. He screamed and jumped out of the way. &quot;It was them&quot; he thought they had come for him and now they know his plan and they were gonna kill him. He had no power and no skill in combat. He is going to lose. He is going to die. <br />
<br />
The light was blinding. He put his hands to the ground and pushed himself up with the energy he had left. He grapped the wall and felt it for comfort. The last comfort he would feel. It was a strange feeling knowing you were going to die. He didn&#39;t know what to feel. Happy to see his family. Or sad to see his plan to fail. All he wanted to do was to avenge them. And he would fail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...Well....Well&quot; A loud distorted voice said &quot;You are sure making a drama out of this situation aren&#39;t you&quot;. The voice came from the entrance to the room. Probably stopping him from escaping. Figures. He wouldn&#39;t make it far anyway. In a weak pathetic voice the guy says &quot;I am doing what you asked me to do&quot;. &quot;Time is very important you know&quot; The deep voice said &quot;We don&#39;t have much of it left&quot;. <br />
<br />
He looked at the voice. It was the lord himself. He was 5 metres tall and overshadowed the entire room. His muscles bulged underneath his skin. Each part of his body was muscular each part was like a red balloon filled to it&#39;s maximum inflation. The veins strained on his body like tributary&#39;s of a river. He was the strongest of them all, the bravest of them all, the most merciless of them all. <br />
<br />
He wore a leather made from bore around his cock and chest. Even with that there it wouldn&#39;t stop his muscles from going out. The only thing stopping him from turning into a raging mindless monster was a wristband on his left arm. It was made out a andrillium a rare material only found in the mantle of the earth. It was the size of a tyre and wrapped out his arm like a snake sucking venom into it&#39;s prayer. It&#39;s quite funny actually, even though he was all powerful his omnipotenial was his downfall. The ultimate weakness of a demon is his wristband it turns them into this beast an uncontrollable monster. Many demons in the war were destroyed this way. You couldn&#39;t kill them they were too powerful the only way to get rid of them was to send them to a different dimension. The dimension was called the Aeternum and these beasts were called feral beasts. As for the king, Well he has a special one this one cannot be destroyed by anything human. It can only be destroyed by a tempature of around about the earths core. But if you were to destroy the ring of the king he wouldn&#39;t lose his mind like the other ones. He has power over it and even takes it off when dealing with feral beasts. Anyway enough of introductions lets get back to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your correct&quot; the small guy says feebly. He doesn&#39;t want to make him angry. He had a look at the ring on the demons arm it was bulging. His left arm was bigger than his right. It causes strain on his left arm and causes a lot of bulging in the ring section.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then have you go the elixir of changes&quot; Says the Demon. Realising his mistake the man looks around. He must of dropped it when the demon got here.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see your vision is very much puny&quot; Says the demon. I turn around and look at the pedestal the bottle is there but how is it there. I look at the bottle is has changed colour. In fact the liquid has changed as well. Instead of the still relaxed water it is furiously bubbling and has turned into a colour resembling magma. Why did this happen did he do this. <br />
<br />
He thoughts are disrupted by the demons laughter &quot;Good job minion&quot;. That word stung him in the back of his neck. To him he was just a slave a useful drive which he could insert into these situations like a computer virus who could be easily cured. &quot;But treachery has got you far in this role I guess&quot; The demon says again. He demon moved towards the liquid. He massive legs moved like machines.<br />
<br />
The man couldn&#39;t stop himself from asking &quot;So are you going to do it now&quot;. He squirmed when he asked the question. How could he be so stupid. He was playing the game so well only to land himself into checkmate. The death move. He know what he must do. The demon would obviously kill him now that he asked for it. He looked at the bottle and made a quick decision. <br />
<br />
He could either go for the bottle and risk his life and drink it. Or he could wait and then steal it from him. These choices were very scary and could easily result in his death. Maybe he can avoid checkmate if he&#39;s slow. Or maybe he can avoid it if he makes a fast decision. <br />
<br />
Fate is very one sided this time choose carefully.</p>
