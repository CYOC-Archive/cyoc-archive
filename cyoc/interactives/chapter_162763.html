<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day had passed faster than he&#39;d expected, refreshingly quick, even.<br />
<br />
For Arhian&#39;s sake, and for his own, he <em>knew</em> he couldn&#39;t stay.<br />
<br />
The mark upon his hand, the one he&#39;d hidden out of fear of having the disease that had cursed his brother; it&#39;s black color had faded away much unlike how the dark letters had consumed Arhian&#39;s skin. And he needed answers. Both to the mark, and to his brother&#39;s condition. <br />
<br />
But of course, grandpapa had forbade him from even stepping foot outside the village, no matter how hard he had pleaded. Selheino was no doubt days away on foot, he knew that, and yet...<br />
<br />
Time was lost to Amier as he gazed out the open window in his room from the soft covers of his bed. The sun had long set beneath the horizon, the ethereal glow of the moon and endless sea of stars replacing its shimmering light.<br />
<br />
Without a sound the pink-haired boy rose from the comforting embrace of his blanket, the white nightgown he wore a stark contrast to the tunic that had clung to his body the past day or so. Not that he&#39;d be wearing it much longer, as trekking through woodland in sleepwear would be less than ideal. Even if Summer was around the corner.<br />
<br />
The wooden floor creaked beneath the youth&#39;s feet the moment he&#39;d attempted to make his way to the wardrobe at his door, forcing him to freeze in hesitation; the thought of stirring grandpapa from his sleep crossing his mind. Not once had he ever attempted something as drastic as sneaking out of his home at such a late hour, and as a result he couldn&#39;t help but feel paranoia wrack him. His plan would be utterly ruined, and he knew as soon as grandpapa had said &quot;no,&quot; changing his mind would be near impossible...<br />
<br />
Testing the floorboards by grinding his heel into them; Amier exhaled quietly; the squeaking nowhere near compared to them responding to his full weight. Perhaps he was being far too careless, allowing his anxiousness to consume him. Grandpapa was old, and chances are he was a deep sleeper.<br />
<br />
Such trivialities he couldn&#39;t afford to let stop him, and so he found himself prying his wardrobe open; hinges thankfully silent. <br />
<br />
Amier was grateful for the moonlight filtering into his room, alleviating his need for a light source. Rummaging through the assortment of garments and clothing, it didn&#39;t take long before he had another tunic in his grasp, the same shade of pink as the one he&#39;d worn earlier; although for both variety and as to have a change of clothing, a similarly-styled green tunic found itself in his arms. A few spare loincloths, nightgowns, and a pair of trousers later, the youth found himself at his bed once more with a backpack; garments and undergarments, a coin pouch with what little gold he had saved up, and a smaller spare blanket tucked neatly within.<br />
<br />
Setting the pack off to his side, Amier lifted the final article of clothing he had yet to don; a simple leather jerkin. Arhian had mailed it to him a few months ago as a gift, yet he&#39;d never really seen much use for it… until now, at least. After adjusting his tunic, it didn&#39;t take much difficulty for him to slip the jerkin over the pink garment. Fidgeting with the belt at his waist for comfort, he hoisted the pack over his shoulders and walked out of his room.<br />
<br />
Slipping free from the cramped hallway, the squeaking floorboards that plagued his insecurities were a thing of the past upon his descent to the first floor of the Eihron household. With grandpapa&#39;s room on the second floor adjacent to his own, he could worry less about rummaging about more freely; which was why he found his attention drawn to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
After refilling a spare water canteen and clipping it to his tunic&#39;s belt, it wasn&#39;t long before the small food bag in his hand was filled to bursting. What little food he could manage to stuff inside consisted of a few apples, an orange, and a few precious pieces of dried bread and jerky. Placing it within his backpack alongside the other necessities, the pink-haired boy noted that what little food he&#39;d packed would last him either a day or two minimum.<br />
<br />
Putting off his future struggles for meals, the pink-clad youth pondered on the final thing he needed; a weapon. A knife from the kitchen came to mind, yet he wouldn&#39;t have anything to really carry it around with lest he cut himself accidentally by throwing it into his pack like an idiot. Or maybe...<br />
<br />
A thoughtful smile crossed Amier&#39;s face, eyes shifting to a small, simple yet ornate box displayed atop a shelf by the staircase. While just out of his reach, it failed to consider usage of a chair and thus found itself in his needful grasp; gently opened to reveal the treasure kept within.<br />
<br />
Glinting faintly, the familiar sheen of a blade met the youth&#39;s prying gaze; a short sword grandpapa prized above all else, the name <em>Elyre&#39;s Will</em> etched into the wooden interior of the box. Examining it upon sitting down, he estimated it to be about 2 feet in length; which would probably serve well enough to fend off any would-be attackers on his journey… hopefully.<br />
<br />
Cautiously lifting the sword into the air, Amier marvelled at the emerald-green gem embedded at the center of the blade&#39;s winged crossguard; silver vine-like patterns encircling the jewel and providing contrast to the simple brown the rest of the hilt took on. The blade in question while appearing remarkably similar to iron, upon closer inspection appeared to contain evidence of wood grain.<br />
<br />
Then again, he recalled from one of grandpapa&#39;s many old stories, that he&#39;d received this as a gift from an old friend from the Continent of Moubaia, a shaman who he described as having the head of a lizard and body of a man.<br />
<br />
Elyre&#39;s Will… yes, surely it&#39;d serve him well. Surely, grandpapa wouldn&#39;t mind him borrowing it for a bit? After all, what was the point of keeping the sword around if it wasn&#39;t going to be used?<br />
<br />
Retrieving the scabbard of the blade and returning the box to the shelf, the pink-haired boy quietly slid the weapon into its resting place; a satisfying click reaching his ears as he clipped it to his belt at his left hip, adjacent to his water canteen.<br />
<br />
Returning the chair to the dining table, Amier retrieved his pack of supplies and heaved it across his shoulders. And as he slipped his feet into his boots, he allowed his ocean blue eyes to return to the dining table before he departed; the three empty chairs a forlorn echo of the day prior.<br />
<br />
...Was he doing the right thing?<br />
<br />
Tapping the toes of his boots against the soft carpet at the door&#39;s entrance, the youth&#39;s gaze fell to the faded mark at his right hand; the intricate design reassuring him of his decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodbye, grandpapa…&quot;<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
With the door shut behind him, Amier embraced the night breeze; his locks of pink curtained hair ruffled by the wind&#39;s gentle touch. A sense of tranquility flooded him as he trekked down the dirt trodden path leading to the central area of Norloc Village; the sheep of the Eihron territory having lost their young shepherd who they could probably care less about.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, he would no longer have to deal with Sylev coming to bug him. Heck, maybe grandpapa could hire him as a new shepherd. How he&#39;d love to return to his home to see Sylev getting trampled by sheep or the like. Or getting hollered at by grandpapa.<br />
<br />
A small smile across his face, the youth forced himself back to reality as the central area of the village popped into view. Many of the shops were closed while the lanterns outside of peoples houses had long blown out. With how small Norloc was, it was doubtful anyone else was truly awake; which he was also grateful for since he wouldn&#39;t have to do any creeping around in the dark.<br />
<br />
Veering down a path leading West upon passing the central plaza, the pink-clad boy froze to a halt; the familiar silhouette of the infirmary at the corner of his vision.<br />
<br />
All at once, Amier felt his mind swirl in confliction; the town gates not far ahead. A few more steps and he&#39;d be out of Norloc Village and into the outskirts and woods beyond…</p>
