<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	&quot;Can you make something to shrink people?&quot; He finally blurted, turning tomato red on his cheeks and gulping.<br />
	&quot;Yep.&quot; The wife said matter of factly. &quot;Totally doable.&quot; She turned to her husband expectantly.<br />
	&quot;Huh? Oh, yeah.&quot; The old man zoned back in, nodding excitedly. &quot;Yeah, sure, kid! Like, people specifically? You don&#39;t wanna make anything else smaller?&quot;<br />
	&quot;Oh!&quot; Max blinked in incredulous surprise. &quot;Just like that?&quot;<br />
	&quot;Ohhh, baby, we&#39;re very good at what we do.&quot; The old woman grinned.<br />
	The old man grinned as well. &quot;Yeah, sure, man! You wanna make people shrink, we can whip you up something to make people shrink. You wanna make critters get tiny, too. We can do that. Or you wanna make both get small, that&#39;s like a 2 for 1 deal, you know? Or maybe you wanna make stuff small, too. Or plants. Or fish. Or whatever. Yeah, we can do it all!&quot;<br />
	&quot;You just tell us what you want, and we&#39;ll make it happen.&quot; The old lady smiled reassuringly, with a heavy wink. &quot;Just like that, like you said. No questions asked. Anything you do it, like, not our business, you know?&quot;<br />
	&quot;Holy crap.&quot; Max stared in amazement. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
	&quot;Yeah, hey!&quot; The old man nudged his wife and laughed. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve actually got some left over tinyizing stuff in the back!&quot;<br />
	&quot;Oh, man. Here we go!&quot; The wife sighed. &quot;He&#39;s so big on like, demos, you know?&quot;<br />
	&quot;Wait, what?&quot; Max blinked. &quot;For real?&quot;<br />
	A few moments later the old man emerged with an exotic looking perfume sprayer in his hand. It was the kind of canister that had a squeeze bulb on one end a needle dispenser on the other.<br />
	&quot;Ready, babe?&quot; The old man grinned.<br />
	&quot;Lay it on me, handsome.&quot; The old lady giggled.<br />
	Max watched in almost slack jawed stupor, excitement burning in his gut, as the kindly old man spritzed his wife once or twice gently her upper body. Incredibly, the woman jumped suddenly and staggered back as she started to shrink in size.<br />
	Nearly all his life Max had experienced a fascination with shrinking and size change. Now he was watching it happen for real as the nice old lady&#39;s clothes began to sag on her dwindling form. With a higher pitched yelp, they all laughed as her pants suddenly fell off her hips and her shirt fell to her knees. The process seemed to gently halt and Max stared down at amazement at the old lady, who smiled back up at him swaying from side to side cutely.<br />
	&quot;Pretty rad, right?&quot; She squeaked, her voice now considerably higher. She was very easily the size of a young child, her shirt increased to a loose dress around her, tiny hands covered by her dangling sleeves.<br />
	&quot;Holy shit.&quot; Max burned red now, let loose with unbridled and suppressed arousal at his impossible fantasy made reality.<br />
	The old man giggled and swept up his now tiny wife in his arms, cradling her up and holding her against his chest. She giggled playfully as he set her down on the countertop and gently patted her tiny butt.<br />
	&quot;H-How is that possible?!&quot; Max stared in awe. The tiny woman on the counter sat down under her giant shirt and threw off her now giant vest to the ground well below her. She teased the boy by looking over herself and holding out her hanging sleeves with an adorable giggle.<br />
	&quot;It&#39;s really cool, right?&quot; The woman squeaked. &quot;See, we know... like, what would you call it?&quot;<br />
	&quot;Like, alchemy, man!&quot; The old man grinned. &quot;Yeah, like, part old science, part old magic, but you put the two together.&quot;<br />
	&quot;Yeah, like lost knowledge. Stuff lost to time.&quot; The tiny old lady grinned. &quot;Do you wanna try it?&quot;<br />
	The old man grinned and held out the perfume sprayer to Max. The boy took it in his hands and blushed deep red. &quot;R-Really?&quot;<br />
	The old man smiled warmly, genuinely amused. &quot;Yeah, man! Give her another blast! See how cool it feels!&quot;<br />
	The old lady braced herself and smiled up warmly as Max turned the nozzle on her and let loose another fine mist across her body. The already tiny woman jumped again and giggled in delight as she shrank further into her shirt. Max stared in wide eyed wonder as the woman&#39;s bare shoulders became visible as her collar fell down over her. She realized the sight and stood up with her collar wrapped around her front as Max stared. She even gave him a lovely little pout, her long gray hair falling in front of her face as she shrank down to no more than twelve inches tall.<br />
	&quot;Nothing like a shrunken woman.&quot; The old man grinned. &quot;If you&#39;re into the whole power dynamic, dude, you can get so much fun out of having such a little lady. Especially if she wants to play. So much nicer when it&#39;s like... both of you into it, you know?&quot;<br />
	&quot;Or maybe you just like watching it.&quot; The old lady lit up, seeing Max&#39;s absolutely flushed face. Her voice had gone even higher, like she had sucked in helium. &quot;Give me one more, watch what happens!&quot;<br />
	The lad stared at the sprayer in his hands and met the old man&#39;s eyes. His expression was warm and playful in return.<br />
	&quot;Hey, she&#39;s the boss of this outfit, man!&quot;<br />
	&quot;He won&#39;t mind.&quot; The old lady stood wrapped in her shirt collar and nodded her consent gently. &quot;Come on, don&#39;t be shy!&quot;<br />
	Max took a breath and complied. He let out another spray over the old lady. This time, she blushed warm crimson and sighed happily as she began to shrink again. This time, to Max&#39;s startled disbelief, she let the shirt collar fall down around her and stood letting the boy watch her naked body shrink.<br />
	Max watched in amazement and blushing excitement as he noted that she was in really good shape and really attractive for her age. The old man chuckled as the boy leered at his shrinking wife.<br />
	&quot;Man, you always did love teasing like this, you little honeypot.&quot;<br />
	&quot;Oh, quiet you.&quot; The old lady shushed her husband. &quot;Let him enjoy the moment.&quot;<br />
	Suddenly aware that he was staring at another man&#39;s shrinking wife with a huge hard on, Max gulped and looked away out of respect.<br />
	The two of them laughed hysterically as the still naked old lady stepped out of her giant shirt and onto the counter. Max looked back and the old man couldn&#39;t stop laughing.<br />
	&quot;It&#39;s cool.&quot; He reassured Max. &quot;She wouldn&#39;t if she didn&#39;t want it, you know?&quot;<br />
	&quot;We&#39;ve seen it all.&quot; She repeated again, now no more than three inches in height and sounding for all the world like the little squeaky voiced doll she now was.<br />
	Max stared at her in wonder as the old man picked up his wife in his hand and she sat in his palm.<br />
	&quot;So, still want some of this stuff for yourself, huh?&quot; The old man grinned wide.<br />
	&quot;Oh my God, yes!&quot; Max blinked excitedly. &quot;D-Does it... does it wear off?&quot;<br />
	&quot;Oh, yeah, it all does, like we said!&quot; The old man nodded. &quot;But we can make it potent, you know, so it lasts weeks. Or months. Or years. Or maybe minutes or hours, dig? And we can do like a counter to it so you can turn people back to normal.&quot;<br />
	The man leaned in and gave his wife a kiss on the head, making her giggle, before placing her in his vest pocket where she leaned over the top and stared at Max with a warm motherly grin.<br />
	&quot;So, uh... how do we... do this?&quot;<br />
	&quot;You tell me how you want it to go down, I&#39;ll tell you how much. I promise it&#39;ll be, like, in your price range. You&#39;re a cool kid.&quot;<br />
	The old lady giggled again in her tiny voice and winked at Max.</p>
