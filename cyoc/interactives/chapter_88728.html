<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day Sam awoke and realised that the floor looked closer now then he noticed that the only clothes he was wearing were a pair of briefs with a childish design on them. He looked in the mirror and saw a boy that looked about nine staring back at him. That could not be right he thought, he was seventeen. This must be a sick dream. He went downstairs to find Sally in the kitchen.<br />
 &quot;What happened to me&quot; he yelled. Carol turned around smiling and said.<br />
 &quot;What do you mean sweetie?&quot;<br />
 &quot;I look like a kid.&quot;<br />
 &quot;Well of course you do, your my little Sammie.&quot;<br />
 Sam was really starting to freak out now, &quot;how is this even possible?&quot;<br />
 &quot;Yesterday I bought this cream that said it would make whoever it was being applied to younger. speaking of which i should have worn gloves, I got some on my hands when i was putting it on you and I&#39;ve lost a few years, or gained...depends on how you look at it.&quot; She lied<br />
 &quot;Why did you do this?&quot; Sam asked.<br />
 &quot;Because, you have been nothing but trouble since you have started living here. I know that you have lost a mother so i decided to give you another mother, Me.&quot;<br />
 &quot;Bu..&quot;<br />
 &quot;But nothing, you are to call me mom from now on, if you don&#39;t call me mom then I will have to give you a spanking, young man. This cream can only make you younger, the only way to reverse its effects is to grow up.&quot;She half lied &quot;I didn&#39;t know how young I wanted my new son, so I am going to leave that up to you. If you behave yourself and accept and act your age then you will get to stay that age and grow up as my son from there, But if you act out or don&#39;t do as your told, then I will make you younger.&quot;<br />
 &quot;How could you do this aunt carol?&quot; sam asked feeling angry.<br />
 Without any hesitation carol grabbed Sam by the neck and sat down on a chair from the table and bent me over her knee. She pulled down his kid undies and spanked his butt. Sam cried out in pain as she started saying while spanking him &quot;I did this because I love you and want you to have a new life with a new family that loves you. you were going down a bad path and this will give you a chance to do it all over again.&quot;<br />
 She gave Sam&#39;s butt a good 15 whacks and pulled up his underwear. She took him by the hand saying &quot;Come on, lets get you some clothes.&quot; <br />
 Carol brought Sam upstairs to his room. She told me about how when i was at the beach she bought me entirely new clothes, from age 1-10.&quot; <br />
<br />
 Carol went to the dresser and took out a pair of denim shorts and a short sleeve shirt with the superman logo on it. She handed Sam the clothes and told him &quot;Go take a shower and put those on, we are going to go to the park today for a picnic.&quot;<br />
Carol and Sam both got in the car, sam was annoyed that he had to sit in the back because Thomas was oldest now,with the picnic basket in the trunk they drove to the park. Sam said nothing the whole way there. when they got to the park Thomas and James went over to play with the other children. So Carol, Becky and Sam went over to a tree and set up the blanket. Carol told Sam that he better start acting like a kid and play with the group of kids in the playground, So he did. Sam played some games with the group of kids for about 2 hours. then Carol called him over and gave him a sandwich. He had a ham and cheese sandwich. Sam felt like he had to go pee badly after he was done eating. Well he had to go when he was playing but he kind of got caught up in the game of tag he was having.<br />
 &quot;aunt; mom I need to go to the bathroom.&quot;<br />
 &quot;You&#39;ll have to wait for Thomas to get back from taking James.&quot;<br />
 &quot;Cant I go by myself?&quot;<br />
 &quot;Honey you&#39;re far to young. You&#39;ll have to wait.&quot;<br />
 Sam couldn&#39;t hold it any longer and just let go wetting his pants. Carol immediately noticed and said that she didn&#39;t bring him a change of clothes so they would go home.<br />
When they got home and Carol went upstairs telling sam to wait in the kitchen for her. When she got back she had a towel with her and she unbuttoned Sam&#39;s pants and pulled them down in the middle of the kitchen. She told him that as punishment for wetting his pants that he would have to wear my pee stained underwear for the rest of the afternoon. She had him sit on the couch in just his undies on top of a towel. She didn&#39;t want him ruining her couch. He sat for hours watching TV in just his kid undies. When it was time for bed Carol took him upstairs and told him to lie on the bed. He had a bad rash from wearing the wet underwear for so long so she peeled them off him and told him to just lay there. She left the room and returned a few minutes later wearing gloves. She took some cream and rubbed his privates down saying that he clearly wasn&#39;t ready to be such a big boy. when she was done she went over to the dresser and took out a pair of goodnite bed wetting pants. They looked like underwear, but much thicker and made out of a cloth like material. she had him stand up as she slipped my legs into them and pulled them firmly up to my waist. She kissed him on the forehead as she tucked him in and said &quot;Goodnight, little one.&quot;<br />
Sam woke up feeling a some wetness around him. He reached his hand under his covers to discover that his goodnite was extremely wet and had even leaked. Upon further interrogation He realized that his goodnite had leaked because he had grown too small to fit into it properly. Sam got out of his wet bed and the goodnites immediately fell to the floor. He stepped out of them and walked over to the door. Before he could reach the door it opened and Carol came in the room. She saw sam standing their in front of the soaked goodnite with no clothes on. She said &quot;Aw, look how cute you are, lets get you in a fresh pull up.&quot;<br />
 Sally went over to the dresser and opened it pulling out a bag of pull up training pants saying &quot;You are about 4 now so I think it would be best if you wear one of these, I will give you a chance to prove that you can still make it to the potty.&quot;<br />
 She pulled out one of the pull ups from the package, it had cars from Disney on it, and held them out for sam to step into. He stood in the pull ups as she pulled them up to his waist saying that He didn&#39;t need any other clothes while home, because she wanted to be able to see if he had any accidents. before he knew what was happening Carol picked sam up with her hand under his butt, and carried me out into the kitchen. Sam was taken over to a booster seat that was now at the table and placed in it. Sally went and got him a bowl of cheerios with a big plastic spoon. She also got him a sippy cup full of orange juice and placed it next to the bowl of cereal. Before he could even pick up the spoon his vision was blocked out for a second while Carol put a bib over his head and around my neck. He sat their mortified by all that was happening to him. He took some cereal and tried to eat it but either the spoon was too big or his coordination was gone because cereal and milk kept ending up on the bib. He hated drinking from the sippy cup, but he was so thirsty so he did anyway. When he was done with everything he asked if he could be let our of the chair because he had to go to the bathroom. Carol lifted him out of the chair and placed him feet flat on the tile floor of the kitchen. She told me to wait right there. She left the kitchen and came back with a plastic potty chair. While Carol was gone Sam dribbled a little bit into the training pants. He felt some pee just kind of come out, it wasn&#39;t a lot though. Carol pulled down his pull ups and sat him on the potty chair. Sam sat their for a little bit and without really feeling it he began to pee in the potty. When he stopped peeing sally told him what a good boy he was and pulled him off the potty and then pulled his pull ups up to his waist. She told him that he could go watch some TV in the living room while she cleaned out the potty chair. While he was sitting in a slightly damp pull up. he kept feeling himself dibble pee into the pull up, but their was nothing he could do to really stop it. After a while of watching cartoon the pull up felt pretty wet. He looked and could see that the car design on the front looked pretty faded, indicating that the pull up had been used. Carol came in a little bit later with a fresh pull up and the plastic potty. She set the potty on the floor and said that its okay that he wet his pull up, little boys tend to dribble without knowing. She had him stand up and pulled off my damp pull up and told him to sit on the potty for a little bit. When he was finished Carol put a fresh pair of pull ups on him and told him that he would be going to daycare today with Becky whilst she went shopping with Thomas and James.<br />
&quot;But aunty Carol&quot; he said. Immediately Carol scooped him up and laid him across her lap. Without saying anything she began to spank him. &quot;I&#39;m not you&#39;re aunty Carol anymore, remember. I am your mother and you will call me mom&quot; she said with a hint of anger but mostly force in her voice. &quot;You will be going to that daycare unless you&#39;re not ready to be such a big boy&quot;.<br />
 After Carol had spanked Sam at least 20 times she put him down. &quot;Ok mom&quot; he answered crying.</p>
