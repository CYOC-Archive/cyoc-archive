<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack was smiling from ear to ear as he pulled into the driveway of his farm. He hadn&#39;t really planned to use the potions on himself. He was going to get a little revenge, and he knew who was going to be first. Rick, his father.<br />
Rick was a typical farmer. He was well built and tall, with black hair. He had handsome features ,and brown eyes.<br />
Jack had been running a pretty good dog breeding business on the farm, but not successful enough for his old man. Rick had made it clear that Jack would have to sell his dogs if he couldn&#39;t find another stud for the bitches. Now he knew where he&#39;d get it.<br />
Jack walked into the house to see his father asleep on the couch, with a bottle of beer on end table. Jack crept over and carefully poured some of the dog potion into the beer. After stashing the potions away, Jack shook Rick.<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot;<br />
Rick woke up looked at Jack.<br />
&quot;Huh? What is it?&quot; He reached for his beer and took a swig. Jack smiled.<br />
&quot;I got another stud!&quot; Said Jack.<br />
&quot;Really? Well lets go give &#39;im the once over.&quot;<br />
Jack and Rick left the house, and made their way to one of the buildings on the farm. The sound of dogs barking could be heard outside.<br />
As the two men entered, Rick thought he could smell something. He couldn&#39;t recognize what it was, but it smelled pretty good. He finished off his beer while he thought. Jack called out to the dogs that were running around and playing. <br />
&quot;Hey girls!&quot; He said. The dogs ran to meet them; barking and wagging their tails. Rick noticed that the good smell had gotten stronger. Jack walked towards the back room.<br />
&quot;Dad, I&#39;ll be right back with the new male dad, could you keep the girls occupied in here?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure thing Jack.&quot; said Rick. Jack went into the back room and closed the door, before looking through a small window to watch. The label on the bottle had stated that permanent transformation would affect the mind. Jack hoped it would.<br />
Rick felt really strange as he waited for Jack. He couln&#39;t keep his mind off the scent in the air, It was intoxicating. He wiped his brow as he unbuttoned his shirt.<br />
His chest was covered in an even coat of fuzz, that was quickly growing and spreading. his ears were moved up his head as they became bigger and pointed. They wiggled instinctively as Rick listened to the dogs bark around him.<br />
Rick was starting to get confused. The dogs kept sniffing his crotch, and he couldn&#39;t help feeling aroused.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with me?&quot; he thought.<br />
&quot;Jack!&quot; he called out. His voiced sounded deeper, almost like a growl. &quot;When are you gonna bring out that new stud?&quot;<br />
Rick&#39;s tongue and mouth felt weird as he continued. &quot;Yoou didn&#39;t loosse him did yoou? These cuooties need sthome larving.&quot; Rick&#39;s new canines didn&#39;t fit to well in his mouth, and his tongue was slipping out as he continued to pet the dogs around him. Rick was sporting a hard on as he inhaled deeply. The scent, he was sure, had to be coming from the dogs.<br />
He had pulled his shirt off by this time, and now found himself crawling on the floor; trying to put his nose where the good smell was coming from. His nose turned black as he licked it. He circled one female, Daisy, and finally found where the scent was coming from.<br />
Daisy presented herself as Rick&#39;s hips and limbs reshaped. He sipped out of his pants and underwear while he went behind Daisy and mounted her.<br />
Rick&#39;s body popped and morphed as his mind struggled to regain control over his new instincts. He felt his now canine member attempting to penetrate his mate. A new tail pushed out from his spine, and wagged gently.<br />
Rick was now completely dog from the neck down. He panted and drooled contently as he continued his mating attempts. He looked around confused as his skull started to shrink. He had a moment of clarity as he finally entered Daisy, but the moment passed as all higher thought was squeezed out of his now tiny brain. As he came in daisy, Rick&#39;s face pushed out into a muzzle; while fur covered the last of his skin. The new dog looked around the room. His once bright eyes had lost their spark of humanity; His simple mind now thinking only of mating.<br />
He recognized this place. this was the place where all the females stayed. He liked this place.<br />
&quot;Do you like the new stud Rick?&quot;<br />
The dog turned to look at the man who called his name. &quot;You did a great job. I don&#39;t know how much I could get for your pups, but mutts are good too.&quot; Rick thumped his leg as Jack scratched him behind the ears. Rick remembered this man too. He was the one who took care of all the dogs. He was sure he liked this man.<br />
Jack picked up his former father&#39;s clothes and beer bottle as he headed for the exit.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll let you have some fun Rick. I&#39;ve got some stuff I need to do.&quot;<br />
As Jack left, Rick mounted another female. He felt like something was wrong, but he stopped caring as he inhaled the females&#39; delicious scent.</p>
