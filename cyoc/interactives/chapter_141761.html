<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morgan sneered as she released yet another blast at Katie, Kellie and their friends. As she watched them scatter she could only snort in frustration. This group of magically aged up teens was giving her more trouble than she had anticipated. “Note to self practice,” she thought maliciously as she watched Kellie and Claudia jump behind a bush.<br />
<br />
Katie winced as yet another blast of magical energy rained down upon her position. “Claudia you doing okay?” Claudia turns towards her long time friend, a scowl plastered across her face. “Oh yeah I’m doing awesome Kat,” she said sarcastically. “Nothing I would rather do than dodge magical shrapnel on a Satueday morning.”<br />
<br />
Another blast of energy sent more debris raining down on the two college age women, chancing a glance they peaked out from their position to observe. Kellie and Mary Elise appeared to be trying to counter some of Morgan’s magical attacks with counter hexes of their own. Despite their best efforts Katie could clearly see Mary Elise was clearly outclassed and was only remaining in the fight thanks to Kellies experience. As they looked towards the other end of the quad they could clearly see Jackie and Katie wrestling with an empty suit of armor. The armor Sasha appeared to be trying to get back in the fight, despite a twisted leg and a hole that had been blasted in the chassis.<br />
<br />
“How the hell are we gong to stop her Kat,” Claudia moaned. Katie shook her head sadly, they were outclassed by Morgan and without any help soon she would destroy them all. “I don’t think we can Claud,” she said sadly. “I’m sorry for getting you into this.”<br />
<br />
Claudia sighedbefore an impish smirk spread across her face. “Well fuck it then,” she smiled. “If I’m going out, I’m gong out in style.” Katie stared horror struck as Claudia left over the bush, a war cry escaping her lips as she charged the sorceress.<br />
<br />
Morgan turned shocked as she noticed the petite blond begin racing towards her. “You can not be serious,” She sneered shaking her head. “Cmon Claudia surely you don’t wish to commit suicide. You know Mika would be absolutely heart broken.”<br />
<br />
Claudia screamed as she grasped her pendent and screamed a spell at Morgan. Although her magic was nowhere near as refined as Katie or Kellies, she had a few tricks up her sleeve. Smiling she waved her hands in towards Morgan, causing a wall of fire to race towards her. Morgan was in total shock as the firewall engulfed her.<br />
<br />
Katie and the others gaped at Claudia as they watched the fire swirl around Morgan LeFay. “Claudia you did it,” Kellie screamed in shock. Claudia could only shrug, giving the others a smug smile before a blast of energy rocketed her backwards into a nearby wall. The unmistakable sound of bones breaking echoed through the quad as Claudia’s body slumped to the ground.<br />
<br />
“That was my favorite outfit,” Morgan bellowed as she glared at Claudia. The sorceress seethed as she examined her flowing robes. Claudia’s attack had singed her clothing as well as her flowing golden hair. Brushing herself off she slowly approached Claudia, a spell slowly building in her clawed hands.<br />
<br />
“Claudia wake up,” Teen Katie screamed as she rushed to help. Morgan saw the girls movements, knocking her backwards with a quick flick of her wrist. Glancing around she could see the others trying to rush to Claudia’s aid and quickly disposed of them by holding her hand up. Bodies now scattered as Morgan loomed over the barely conscious girl. “Enjoy the afterlife Claudia,” she grinned. “May the darkness consum.....URK!”<br />
<br />
Claudia had watched Morgan approach and was unable to do anything. She could tell she had some broken ribs, as well as possibly a broken collarbone. As she was in the middle of making her peace she noticed an odd look cross Morgan’s face as if someone was choking her. Glancing behind her she couldn’t have been more shocked by what she saw.<br />
<br />
“Daddy?”<br />
<br />
Tom Harris’s massive hands had grasped Morgan by the neck and now dangled the sorceress a foot of the ground. “No one touches my daughter,” he growled as he now flung Morgan’s limp body through a plate glass window. An explosion of glass cascaded over Morgan’s prone body. “Claudia,” he said sternly. “Are you alright? What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
Claudia could feel her eyes dampen as she stared at the massive figure of her father. “Long story daddy,” she sniffed. “Evil sorceress trying to destroy the world, trying to stop her.”<br />
<br />
“When this is over young lady you and I are having a serious talk.”<br />
<br />
“Katie,” Gloria called. Katie turned, sighing with relief as Gloria ran into the quad. “I got everyone I could. Are you guys alright?” Katie smiled as she beheld the backup her sister had brought. Not only were her friends now here, Gloria had brought hers as well. Katie could even see that Gloria had brought Kellies friends from the alternate timeline her as well. “You did great Glo,” she grinned. “But How did Mr. Harris get here too.”<br />
<br />
“He was visiting Cole and Kumiko,” Lisa stated. “So were me and Jason when Gloria showed up.” Lisa rushed over as fast as she could as she examined her adopted daughter. “God Katie are you okay?”<br />
<br />
“I’ve been better mom,” Katie sighed. “I’m just glad you’re all here.” <br />
<br />
Morgan groaned as she slowly now stood, brushing pieces of glass off her now tattered robes. She was furious with herself for letting a mortal sneak up on her like that and attack her. Glaring at the now large group of people gathered in front of her she could feel her rage building. “Do you REALLY think you can stop me,” she bellowed. “I am the most powerful sorceress in this reality or any other. You are nothing but insects to me!”<br />
<br />
“Bitch,” Lisa yelled. “I don’t care who are what you are. You hurt my kids and now we’re going to end you.”<br />
<br />
Morgan sneered as she watched the group now prepare to attack, this battle would soon come to an end.</p>
