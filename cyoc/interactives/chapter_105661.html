<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the next two weeks, Katie went about her life as if nothing had changed. It was hard for her friends and family not to notice her subtle changes. Katie had seemingly become a vegetarian overnight, and had started running more frequently. She couldn&#39;t explain why, though deep down she knew it had to do with THAT night. Which she refused to talk about in fear that it would turn out to be real, and not just a horrible memory. <br />
<br />
But she couldn&#39;t ignore things anymore. Tonight the moon would be full, and Katie was more nervous than ever. The past week had been a nightmare, as it became painfully obvious that the events that took place nearly a month ago had happened. Katie&#39;s body was getting hairier every day, and her nails started looking very dirty. Only yesterday did she realize it wasn&#39;t dirt, it was her nails turning black in preparation for their transformation into hooves. <br />
<br />
She&#39;d waited as long as she could before coming to the realization she was going to have to go back to the shop. Katie was preparing to go to the shop when the doorbell rang. She knew it wouldn&#39;t be long until she was staring down a muzzle looking at her watch. Katie hoped whoever it was would go away, but the doorbell rang again. So Katie reluctantly answered it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Katie, what&#39;s with the hat?&quot; Josh, her next door neighbor asked upon seeing the woolen hat Katie had on. It covered her furry, and pointed ears, and the fact that her hair line was receding into one straight line. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, nothing. Just something I found in my closet. What&#39;s up Josh?&quot; Katie asked in a quiet voice. She was worried if she spoke louder he&#39;d notice that her voice was more of a neigh than a human voice. The changes were speeding up as the moon rose. Katie wasn&#39;t sure how much longer she had before Josh started to notice she wasn&#39;t entirely human anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not much. But, well, I&#39;ve noticed you haven&#39;t been leaving your house much the last few nights.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, ya. I&#39;ve had a lot of school work to catch up on.&quot; Katie said blushing. The real reason she hadn&#39;t left her house much in the past week was because she&#39;d been so horny. The closer to the full moon she got, the larger her pussy got. The first thing Katie did in the morning was masturbate. She could go a day without pleasuring herself, but by night she&#39;d have to do it three or four times. <br />
<br />
To Katie&#39;s embarrassment, as her pussy got larger, she had to find larger objects to fill herself. She&#39;s purchased a number of realistic horse cock dildos online. They seemed to be the only things that could satisfy her craving, other than getting the actual thing. And Katie wasn&#39;t that desperate. Yet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I thought maybe you&#39;d like to come to a party with me. Not as a date or anything, just as a friend. You know, get out of the house a little. Everyone needs a break now and then&quot; Josh said, blushing slightly. Had this been any other night, Katie would have been flattered and said yes. But seeing as she could feel fur creeping up from her crotch to her stomach, she couldn&#39;t. Unless Josh had a thing for hairy girls. <br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate the offer, really I do, but I can&#39;t tonight.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got plans?&quot; Josh indicated the backpack on Katie&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that, yes.&quot; Katie smiled weakly. She could feel her spine stretching. A small nub was now pressed up against the edge of her pants. It wiggled it&#39;s way out, and became a three inch hairless tail. Katie swallowed nervously, which Josh unfortunately noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong Katie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t sound so sure.&quot; Josh&#39;s eyes narrowed and he glanced into the house. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine. I just have somewhere to be.&quot; Katie said, trying to push past Josh. But he wouldn&#39;t budge. He leaned forward, something inside the house catching his attention. The smell. It was like sticking his head inside a barn. At first he thought it might be an air-freshener or porporri. But the longer he breathed in the stale air the more he thought something was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez Katie, have you been keeping a herd of horses in here?&quot; Josh half joked. Katie&#39;s face paled and she shook her head as fast as she could without it snapping off. That only made him more suspicious <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon Katie. If something&#39;s wrong you can tell me. I don&#39;t remember you ever being an animal person, so what&#39;s going on? You&#39;re not growing pot or something in the basement right?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no! I&#39;m not growing anything!&quot; Katie was so flustered now. And in an ironic twist, she was growing something. A tail. It was hanging outside her pants, probably five inches long now. And Katie could feel long hair starting to grow from the tip. Every so often it would flick, and she&#39;d panic that Josh might have seen it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Josh, I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t go with you, but I really do have somewhere to be.&quot; Katie almost begged him. Josh got the message and backed off. But not before noticing there was something stuck to the back of Katie&#39;s neck. Some white, kinda looked like hair. But too thick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, you&#39;ve got something on...&quot; Josh stopped when Katie&#39;s hand went to her neck. Her mane was growing and when she put her hand down, it became obvious to Josh that it was a mane He stumbled backwards and bit, tripping over his own feet in surprise. He landed on his ass, still staring at Katie who was rushing to her car. <br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t even care that she&#39;d pinned her tail underneath her as she slid into the seat. Katie didn&#39;t look back as she tore out of the driveway and headed for the mall.</p>
