<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A now 59 year old Karen smiled, although she knew her students feared her she did have a soft spot for them. She tried to instill a sense of discipline in her students, in her opinion well behaved students were better students. She had tried being more friendly with her students in the beginning of her career but found they tried to take advantage of the situation, squandering the gifts they naturally had.<br />
<br />
Sighing, the now fifty year old teacher looked at her reflection. She was slightly surprised by what she saw. Her face seemed less tired than usual and there seemed to be more black than gray in her hair. Believing it to be a trick of her mind Karen shrugged and continued to gaze at the decor in the living room.<br />
<br />
Mika ran to Claudia and Katie with a look of concern on her face. &quot;She wants to talk to you Claudia,&quot; she said. Katie and Claudia smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Mika,&quot; Katie said pointing at Karen. &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll need to worry about her for too much longer.&quot; Puzzled, Mika looked back at her teacher and smiled. From their vantage point the girls could see Karen regressing without being seen.<br />
<br />
Karen had left her fifties and had reentered her forties. The woman was attractive with dark hair, a curvy build and smooth skin. The fine lines around her eyes were slowly vanishing and her large d cup breasts were beginning to rise. As she reentered her thirties her beauty was beginning to shine through. Karen had a pretty and kind looking face with crystal blue eyes. The gray in her hair was gradually disappearing revealing a very attractive woman of 35.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow she&#39;s really pretty,&quot; Mika commented. &quot;Wonder why she is so mean,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Maybe it has something to do with her childhood. Guess we get to find out tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls smiled as Karen reentered her twenties. Karen was feeling more energetic as she became 29. Her flawless alabaster skin and long black hair glowed with youthful energy. The young teacher smiled as she stared at some of the pictures around the house. In her mind she had been a teacher for five years now and loved what she did. Karen thought back at how painfully shy she had been as a child and it had been her teachers who helped bring her out of her shell. Now she wanted to do the same for her students.<br />
<br />
As Karen became 25 her body continued to change. The slacks she wore appeared tight on her firm and curvy legs. The blouse and cardigan she wore loosened around her trim waist but swelled around her massive breasts that continued to rise. Karen had been told that she was an attractive girl but she never felt like that. She was such a wallflower and only felt comfortable when studying. As the girl became 24 she shook her head, she had not thought about her childhood in quite awhile. Brushing her black hair out of her face she noticed a teddy bear on the floor and smiled. Her parents had been very poor and she could never afford much. One of the few toys she did have was a teddy bear similar to the one now lying on the floor.<br />
<br />
A now 22 year old Karen stood up and walked to the bear lying in the middle of the room. Karen was surprised at how loose her pants were in the waist. Karen smiled and hugged the bear close to her chest. Looking around, the girl was confused. She had come here to talk with Mika&#39;s grandmother about her daughter but couldn&#39;t understand why. She was only a student teacher at this point and had been told it wasn&#39;t her business to get this involved with her students. Still she believed that it was her duty to provide the best opportunity for her kids no matter what her bosses had to say. <br />
<br />
Mika, Claudia, and Katie watched as Karen’s regression finally ceased.The dark haired girl was attractive with dark hair, pale skin and beautiful eyes. The girls watched as Tricia came down to her and smirked at her. “Thanks for coming with, Kare-Bear. Though if I were you, I’d get yourself a costume for the College Party. Y’know, once we’re done babysitting the little munchkins.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know…” Karen glared shyly. “It’s my first time and I’m supposed to get up bright and early tomorrow…”<br />
<br />
“Nothing a cup o joe wont solve.” Tricia smiled back as she grasped Karen’s arm and pulled her to the walk-in closet. “Come on, I’ll pick for you!”<br />
<br />
“Hey, wait!”</p>
