<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mind on other matters, the fact that Chronivac was on her computer, within easy access for any to find, Rowan took her stuff and headed upstairs. Inside the kitchen, as she came to terms with new memories that told her that, when she stayed over at Dennis or Tristan&#39;s place, she no longer slept in the same room as them, but rather a guest bedroom, she stopped when she almost ran into Tristan&#39;s mom.<br />
<br />
The woman smiled and exclaimed, &quot;Oh, Rowan. I didn&#39;t even hear you come upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try and make some noise next time,&quot; the teenage girl responded with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need,&quot; the woman answered. &quot;My head’s a million miles away, as I have I don&#39;t how much stuff to do before I go to work,&quot; and indicating toward the island in the middle of the kitchen, she explained, &quot;I left you, Dennis and Tristan money to order pizza later, if you still want. There&#39;s food and drink in the fridge, as you well know, so please feel free to help yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Mrs Louis,&quot; Rowan answered and shifting her bag so she had a better hold on, she was about to head for the bedroom, when she heard the woman ask, &quot;Are you all right dear? You seem, I don&#39;t know, off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Never before had she had this much of a conversation with Tristan&#39;s mom. Always exchanging a few polite words here and there, the most conversation she&#39;d ever had with either of Tristan&#39;s parents when she was still Patrick was the talks she’d sometimes had with Mr Louis. Now, the hearing the woman&#39;s question, it seemed to hit home even more how things had changed and that the woman was approaching her the same way a mother would attempt to talk with her daughter. Shrugging, and almost dropping her stuff, Rowan said, &quot;Just the usual stuff,&quot; feeling this was the safest answer instead of telling Mrs Louis everything about the Chronivac and her use of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if there is anything you ever feel you need to talk about, please know I am hear,&quot; Tristan&#39;s mom told her as she reached for her purse and keys. Slipping the bag’s strap over her shoulder, Mrs Louis smiled and said, &quot;Don&#39;t forger to tell Tristan about the money. Well, unless there is anything else, I&#39;m off to run some errands, and will be home later this evening. Oh. And reminded Tristan his dad is working a double. So, if there is any problems, and he needs to get ahold of him, he is to call Mr Louis’ place of work, not his mobile.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod and Rowan replied, &quot;Will do,&quot; as she stepped around the woman, who disappeared out the back door.<br />
<br />
The moment the backdoor closed, Rowan headed for the guest bedroom. Finding it as her memories insisted she would next to Mr and Mrs Louis&#39; bedroom, she set her pack on the bed. Sitting down, thinking about her conversation with Mrs Louis and what she&#39;d picked up on during  it, she was conflicted. Wanting to know if this was normal for all girls, or if it was unique to her situation due to her being the only girl in a Dungeons and Dragons group of boys, she couldn&#39;t help and think that, in a way, she herself was still a boy. Mind going to the cock she still had, she was unable to stop herself from telling herself, &quot;I&#39;m a chick with a dick,&quot; even as other memories surfaced that told her that no one knew this, as she&#39;d been careful all her life to conceal this about herself.<br />
<br />
Interested to know what else about her memories and life had changed, she heaved a sigh. Telling herself she&#39;d have to figure it out at a later, she began to unpack her stuff for the weekend. Putting it where she remembered having alway put the stuff, she arranged it, then headed for the bathroom. Closing the door, she peered into the mirror over the mirror at the girl reflected back. Finding herself unsure about what she saw, Rowan was unable to stop herself as she questioned how pretty she was, despite how people kept telling her she was. Seeing nothing she&#39;d change about herself, even though she tried, she found she was happy being a girl as she walked over to the toilet. Lifting the seat and lid, she pushed down her pants and underwear, missing that the latter were now a pair of panties, and tried to pee standing up. Failing too difficult to do that, as her unit was too small for her to grasp and that it didn&#39;t feel right standing, holding herself she lowered the seat and sat down to do her business, mentally going over as she did how normal, right, it seemed sitting down to do so.<br />
<br />
After she&#39;d finished, she returned to the sink to wash her hands. Again staring at her reflection, she was again brought back to wondering if maybe she&#39;d gone too far in her exploration of understanding the opposite sex. Asking herself, &quot;Should I go back to being Patrick?” she was startled when she posed the question, &quot;Do I want to go back to being Patrick?” which she found was a surprising and affirmed no.<br />
<br />
Done in the bathroom, she exited. Her mind still on all the new revelations she felt confronted her, Rowan returned to the kitchen. Taking from a cupboard a tall, plastic cup that had a Marvel character printed on it, she opened the fridge and after some deliberation, selected the orange juice. Pouring herself a good portion, she returned it to where she&#39;d gotten it. Taking an apple from a bowl on one of the counters, she headed back down into the basement. Reaching the foot of the stairs, she stopped the moment she heard the crashing sounds from the living room. Concerned about what she was hearing, she had enough sense to set her drink down on one of the steps out of the walkway before she ran toward the sounds, wondering what was going on.</p>
