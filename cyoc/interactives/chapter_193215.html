<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You toyed with the Voodoo Doll of Masculinity, turning it over and over, while you tried to decide on who you wanted to use it on. It would have to be someone close to you because you needed to obtain hair from them. Dad? No, Dad was already a manly man, he was cool already. What about Mom? No again, you liked Mom, she didn’t need to be manlier. If she did become a man, she would probably cry no matter how masculine she would become, and you didn’t want to hurt mom like that. Best friend? It would be a pain to go to their house right now. <br />
<br />
In the end, you chose your younger sister Monique, who was two years younger than you at just 18. Years ago you were close to her, she was such a cute innocent sibling back then, but now Monique was kind of a bitch. She acted haughtily and dressed skimpily. She was now seductively hot, flaunting her big boobs and ass without care. She dated the hot boy of the week before dumping him for the next. Last, of all, she was rude to your parents and to you. She must have hung with the wrong crowd, while you lived your own life. <br />
<br />
Anyway, your sister was chilling on the couch on her phone in the living room, giving you free rein to go into her room and take a hair from her comb. With the hair stuffed in the Voodoo Doll, you pondered on what to make masculine about Monique. You didn’t buy the other dolls so any change you made would be permanently boyish in some way. With her personality, you shuddered at the prospect of having a super roided younger brother, as she would beat you black and blue if she found you had done a full body masculine transformation on her. You needed to change her in a more subtle way, and what body part is more subtle than the genitals.<br />
<br />
“Masculescant Transformatio,&quot; you chanted quietly, hidden in the hallway. Focusing on Monique’s groin, you saw her flat mound quickly bulge and grow, stretching out her short boyshorts. Monique of course noticed the growth as well. She had dropped her phone and was pressing on the bump with her hands, squeezing her thighs, doing everything to stop the growth. Her efforts were in vain as her new cock and balls continued to grow without her consent, now visible through the thin stretchy material of her boyshorts. Her new manhood expanded and surged in growth causing her to scream as her cock and balls escaped their prison of cloth, allowing them to hang massively between her legs.<br />
<br />
Boy was her new maleness huge. From your hidden position, her flaccid length must have been 9 inches or more, and that’s not to mention her 6-inch diameter balls. Both were hideously oversized for her female body, and yet if put on a male it would still be an oversized wonder.<br />
<br />
You noticed that Monique was now frantically groping her cock and balls trying to find her pussy and what caused her transformation. Of course, her investigation was in vain, as her vagina didn’t exist anymore, and her touch made her grow erect as a natural bodily response. Her cock expanded and expanded its veiny length until it was 12 inches long, girthier as well. Your sister had a horrific look on her beautiful yet slutty face. You could almost tell that she couldn’t understand how this was happening. Her visceral thoughts must have jumped from genetic mutation to a new sexual disease, but she was wrong the culprit was magic.<br />
<br />
The voodoo doll that you were gripping now had a miniature wooden replica of what lay before your eyes. Since she was now lost in fearful thought, Monique wasn’t doing anything, she was just staring at her troubling meat tower. You then started to jerk the doll off, grinning in glee as phantom hands began to jerk your sister’s penis.  She yelped, gripped, and held her long schlong of a dong, trying to stop the nonconsent invisible sensations that were assaulting her sensitive towering length. Of course, her actions only added to the fire as she could feel the pleasurable flames increase by two floods as now it was like two people fapping her. <br />
<br />
Now the unwanted lust overtook her selfish rude delinquent mind. In tune with her degenerate behavior,  her inhibition was no more, and now she put her skills of milking dick on herself. She played with her tip and jerked on her generous foreskin. She teased and jerked her meat, squeezing clear precum out to lubricate her flesh sword. She must have learned how to hand job from her one-night boy toys, cause she had skills.  You picked up the pace of your doll fapping, causing your sister to increase her speed as well. Her furious masturbation made her big balls bounce as well as her jiggly giant jugs.<br />
<br />
Monique then came, her eyes rolled back and her mouth huge open but she didn’t stop fapping, and neither did you. Cum spurt spurted in large angled arcs white, and gooey. More and more shot out, yet the fury of you and your sibling didn’t subside. Throbbing and shaking her cock came and came until her large load was shipped to the outside world.  Well, you didn’t stop and she didn’t stop fapping herself so her erection lived on. <br />
<br />
The semen only made it easier for Moquie to fap as the extra slick stickiness added new sensation to her shaft. Again after a few minutes of mindless repetition, your sister shot her second load. It was no less impressive as her fist orgasm, with icky whiteness making her glisten in the afternoon light. Exhausted after two massive floods, your sister lay on the couch, cock dripping and twitching as it went soft.<br />
<br />
Well, you were satisfied at punishing Monique, so you left to your room to see if you could jerk yourself off with the doll, and maybe get a bigger dong.</p>
