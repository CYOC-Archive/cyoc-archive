<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Within a flash, Penny, Quinn, and the much older and flabbier Scarlett, were suddenly standing within Penny’s family living room,<br />
“H-how did we get here..?” Scarlett asked, her voice frail from ‘age’,<br />
“It’s all magic!” Penny said, “how have you not realised that?” She asked,<br />
“So that blue haired woman,” Scarlett started,<br />
“Quinn,” she said, addressing herself, “is able to do anything that fits within the bounds of your reality… however that barrier is able to be stretched, depending on the circumstance,”<br />
“How do I make you change me back, then?” Scarlett said. Less asking, more demanding,<br />
“You cannot,” Quinn stated,<br />
“But I can!” Penny says, “Quinn, if you would change her back for me,” she asked,<br />
“Of course,” Quinn said. Her eyes glowed for a moment before returning to normal.<br />
<br />
Scarlett could feel her body tightening again as her skin began to look much less flabby. The excess weight from her belly moved into her chest, making her breasts much more pronounced just as they were before.<br />
<br />
Before long, her age was now back as it was, her body fixed… she just didn’t appear to be wearing any clothes,<br />
“PENNY!” She yelled,<br />
“Shhhh!” Penny said, “stop screaming all through time!” Penny said, “Quinn, can you make her ‘clothed’ again,”<br />
“Of course,” Quinn said.<br />
On Scarlett’s body, a pair of comfortable shorts, a white tank top, and a black push up bra. Just as she had been wearing before,<br />
“Do you always have to make your boobs look so big?” Penny said, mockingly,<br />
“Funny coming from mosquito bites,” Scarlett snapped back, as she usually would.<br />
<br />
Both girls knew exactly what was going to happen next,<br />
“Don’t do it,” Scarlett said, sighing,<br />
“Of course I’m going to do it,” Penny said, “you’d do exactly the same,”<br />
“I mean… yeah…” Scarlett admitted,<br />
“Quinn, make my boobs bigger than Scarlett’s. Make my butt bigger than Scarlett’s. Make me taller than Scarlett. And just make me look more mature than Scarlett.” Penny said,<br />
“My pleasure,” Quinn says. Her eyes glowing for a fraction longer than usual.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Penny, standing right beside Scarlett, began to change. Her breasts were the first thing. Her top had no bra in it due to her small size, so her chest began to rise very clearly against the top. Her nipples poked through her top much more. Before long, her breasts were approaching the same size as Scarlett’s, making her visibly get jealous,<br />
“This is totally unfair,” Scarlett said, “I’m meant to be the one with big boobs!” She sulked. Penny could only laugh as she held her new breasts in her hands, feeling the soft flesh shape around her dainty fingers. They were now the same size as Scarlett’s,<br />
“You’re right,” Penny says, “these things are pretty heavy!” Penny said, still mocking her soon-to-be smaller breasted friend,<br />
“Whatever,” Scarlett replied.<br />
Penny’s breasts were now bigger than Scarlett’s, looking perfectly round under her shirt, even with no support.<br />
Finally, they came to a halt. At least two cup-sizes larger than Scarlett’s double-D’s, she held them with pride, “what do you think?” Penny asked,<br />
“Whatever,” Scarlett said again, refusing to acknowledge them,<br />
“Awwww. Someone’s jealous!” Penny mocked her,<br />
“Jealous?” Scarlett started, “I don’t think I’m going to be jealous of back-pain!” She said, masking her genuine jealousy.<br />
<br />
Penny felt the next change to coming, “oh!” She said, excitedly. She turned her body, poking her butt towards Scarlett, knowing her next change was going to make her jealous.<br />
Her butt began to rise in her own loose fitting red shorts. As much as she didn’t want to, Scarlett couldn’t help but stare as Penny’s butt rose like dough in an oven. It was quite mesmerising.<br />
“Go ahead, touch it!” Penny said, mocking her friend. Scarlett looked shocked, looking Penny in the eyes, then back at her rear, “seriously, go ahead!” Penny said, “I wanna know what it’ll feel like,”<br />
“Hell no!” Scarlett said,<br />
“Oh c’mon, Scarlett. At least use the opportunity,”<br />
“Fine!” Scarlett said… maybe with a little too much haste, “but this is not some excuse to ‘practice kissing’ again,” she said, sternly,<br />
“Whatever you say,” Penny said, poking her butt towards Scarlett.<br />
She put her hands out, gently cupping Penny’s cheeks. She wasn’t pressing hard, but as her butt grew, her hands cupped more and more. It was a weirdly soothing experience. She didn’t play with her butt, just allowing it to fill more and more of her hands.<br />
<br />
Within a few moments, the growth slowed, coming to a complete stop. But Scarlett hadn’t taken her hands off of Penny’s butt yet,<br />
“Ugh… Scarlett. I think I’m done,”<br />
“Not yet…” Scarlett said. She knew that there was still one more change left,<br />
“Seriously, Scarlett, I’ve— OH!” She yelped, interrupting herself as she felt her whole body growing. Scarlett kept her hands on her butt as it slowly began to rise upwards. Penny felt a surge of the same feeling all over her body as she did.<br />
Her legs got longer, her torso extended slightly, her arms as well. Even her neck got a little longer.<br />
It was the least exciting of her changes, but was still a fun one.<br />
<br />
Penny looked down at herself, admiring her brand new curves. She was nowhere near a giant, in fact, she was still a little shorter than Quinn. But she was definitely around her brothers height.<br />
She looked down at Scarlett and smirked, “you have fun with my butt?” She asked,<br />
“It wasn’t… like… fun or anything. But it felt super nice. I can’t explain it,”<br />
<br />
“I’ve heard that before,” Quinn said, getting the attention of the two girls, “there is a ‘second-hand’ feeling from changing someone, which anyone who touches the changing area may feel. It’s an odd phenomenon, but I have never had a complaint from it,”<br />
“And I’m still not complaining!” Scarlett said, making sure she was clear.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Penny said, “now that I’m definitely ‘sexier’ than you,”<br />
“Sure,” Scarlett dismissed,<br />
“It’s true,” Quinn said, “81.7% of the population would consider Penny objectively more attractive than you,”<br />
“Interesting!” Penny said, then having a semi-cruel idea for Scarlett, “what is a tiny thing about Scarlett that she doesn’t like about herself?”<br />
“WHAT!?” Scarlett said, “don’t be such a bitch, Penny! You know she’ll probably get it right as well!”<br />
“Well then… let’s find out!”</p>
