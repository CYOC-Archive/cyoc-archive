<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim for his part was - as he walked back to his tent - intrigued by the possibilities of this pool and what it had done to him so far. <br />
<br />
It had given him more results than even a couple months in the gym in a matter of moments, and he didn&#39;t doubt that a quick little shot of the water right before sex would have any woman he fooled around with enjoying a night with a powerfully aroused Tim. He&#39;d also just as well never really noticed the fact that his muscles looked so good without any hair covering them up. His chest looked broader, stronger, bigger in general - and it was all accentuated by the lack of hair, which seemed to bring out every little aesthetic curve and rippling line. It definitely got him thinking as he took a seat back in his tent.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d brought a razor for use with any whiskers or beard growth he might incur during his time away from the comforts of college life, but now that he thought about this so much... Well, it was kind of feminine, honestly, Tim found himself thinking as he clutched his razor. Isn&#39;t it mostly women who shave themselves up on their arms, legs and stuff like that? He remembered helping one of his girlfriends with her own shave back in college. <br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t wholly a selfish lover, after all. <br />
<br />
Tim found himself thinking about it as he clutched the handle of the razor. He remembered his girlfriend&#39;s skin going from rather rough to smooth and very sexy. As in, immediately after he helped her out with that, she was on him - hot and heavy. And he could feel every inch of her smooth, sexy body. And he found himself thinking in that moment. If it&#39;s good for girls, why wouldn&#39;t it feel just as good for a man&#39;s man like him? <br />
<br />
Gingerly setting the razor down, Tim stood and quickly took his shirt off. Preening and posing as he stood there, he at first flexed and posed for the adoration of some imagined lover watching him make a show of himself. As he accentuated his lats and pressed his chest forward, grinning, he found himself looking again at his nipples. He hadn&#39;t really thought about them in a sexual context before, but here they were. Larger somewhat, more prominent, and---oh so sensitive. <br />
<br />
He remembered tugging on them in the heat of the moment with Zeke. Really enjoying the sheer sensation as whatever worked its way through him via the waters enhanced and made him stronger. Tim was honestly of a mind to bring a bit of this stuff with him and try it during a workout. But that was hardly the point. Heh, hardly. He found himself curious as he saw it seemed like his nipples grew a little erect from both the crisp air in the tent and the vaguely sexual thoughts coursing through Tim&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
The young man began rubbing his hands over his chest and abdomen. Enjoying the rock hard feeling of his abs, if anything even more carved, toned and powerful - and then there was his chest...! His pecs were powerful, big, well formed...and now they were crowned by a pair of alluring, sensitive nipples. He found himself remembering that girlfriend - thinking of how she&#39;d tease him about how eager he was to touch her boobs. How if only he knew how it felt.<br />
<br />
Tim blushed a little as he paused in the midst of rubbing his palms over the nipples, bolts of pure pleasure rippling through them all the way down his body to his rapidly erecting cock. &quot;Is...Is this what she m-meant...?&quot; Tim found himself wondering if he could really...? I mean, he thought, with such an erogenous zone it would only make sense to explore it. There wasn&#39;t anything really girly about it. Just enjoying what felt good. He was a man&#39;s man - and he just happened to have some really nice, sensitive nipples...<br />
<br />
So Tim wondered. Could he really masturbate the whole way...? Just by touching his chest?<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
If Tim was getting a bit hot and bothered by the changes he&#39;d undergone, Zeke was full on in a completely horny frenzy. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d only barely gotten himself back into the tent before frantically stripping down. By the time he was done, the somewhat older man stood there, erect, naked, flush in the face, and breathing heavily. Zeke regarded his body. His powerful, plump pectorals, pressing out so very much, his large, well muscled ass that on any other day he&#39;d have seen as a guy having a case of &quot;lady bum&quot;. But his ass had felt so good, it was impossible for Zeke to muster any complaints. His thighs and his quads seemed to be the standouts along with his ass. As outstanding as his upper body was, his lower body was magnificently muscled and made him look almost a little bottom-heavy.<br />
<br />
Zeke for his part however could hardly concentrate on his muscular body when he was newly fixated on obtaining a lasting sexual release.<br />
<br />
For as much as Tim had been driven into a rut by the changes, Zeke was on another level. The man had in the process of imbibing that bit more ended up that much more aroused, erotically insistent, and distracted. He knew he had duties on this excursion. He knew he had things he needed to do. He needed to look after Tim, make sure he didn&#39;t do anything stupid. Help out on the archaeological side of things... but there was hardly any chance of him getting that done in a competent way when he was so damned distracted!<br />
<br />
Thus he rationalized his current state and his preoccupation with it. Yet even as he pistoned his hand up and down on his meaty rod, sweat dripping down his brow, Zeke found himself frustrated yet again. His hand was hardly stimulation enough. Even as he experimented, cupping his balls, teasing his taint, and twisting a nipple, he hungered for something different. Zeke disregarded how immature it made him look even as he in his desperation brought his pillow over, folded it to approximate feminine lips, and then commenced madly humping into the approximate.<br />
<br />
Yet even as he tried to tighten the pillow around his cock, to remind himself of some woman he and Tim had fooled around with before he couldn&#39;t manage the exact sensations needed. Zeke groaned and tussled with himself as he rolled around on his bed. He needed this, dammit he needed this, but there wasn&#39;t anything he could get out of his hand or any of the assistants around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just...I gotta fuck...fuck, man! I gotta fuck...&quot; Zeke murmured to himself. Yet most likely James was enjoying a nice fuck session with Sarah Ramos, going by how hard that girl pined for him. And he doubted that James would be open to allowing Zeke into any sexual events going on in his tent. He was however strongly tempted to try. He didn&#39;t even care there&#39;d be another man in the same torrid fuck. Just so long as Zeke got off.<br />
<br />
Zeke then paused when he heard something in the bushes around his tent.<br />
<br />
He initially thought it might be an eavesdropper or a voyeur...but any wariness around that topic faded as his newly preoccupied state found him thinking that he hoped any voyeur got a good look at Zeke&#39;s body. And hey, maybe it was a sexy female voyeur, a local - hoping to see what a strong American&#39;s body looked like. The idea made Zeke&#39;s dick twitch.<br />
<br />
All that remained for now was deciding what to do...</p>
