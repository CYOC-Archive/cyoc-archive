<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You sat in the van patiently as it made several stops, each time letting one of the other passengers out before traveling deeper in the forest.  A big part of the fun of these events was the hunt, so giving each participant some space would help make things more interesting for both sides.  Plus, Andrew had promised that prey who survived the next two weeks would be allowed to live out the remainder of their lives in the new form – a small respite for losing out on the predator/prey roulette.<br />
<br />
Not that you cared.  You and Andrew went way back.  The first party you’d been to was… five years ago?  You’d ended up as a male lion in a safari themed night of blood and sex.  The next year was a swamp theme and you’d ended up as an alligator.  The anatomy of that form was strange enough that you’d never figured out if you had gotten a female costume, or just a gay one, but the hunger that you had felt kept you from exploring the sexual side that some of these parties could have.<br />
<br />
Given your long history with Andrew, and the fact that you’d fucked as predators on a few occasions, he’d told you that he would rig the costumes so that you’d be a predator.  He couldn’t guarantee the gender, or what predator it was, but you were going to be on the devouring side of things, not getting devoured.<br />
<br />
The van made another stop and the driver moved around to back, fiddling around with a trunk of costumes that was attached to the vehicle’s bumper before sliding open the side door.  <br />
<br />
“Your turn,” he said, pointing to the young man seated next to you, before holding up a skunk costume.  <br />
“Is that a predator or…” the man tepidly asked.<br />
<br />
“That’s up to you.  If you managed to eat someone else, we’ll call you a predator and release the lock on your costume when this is over.  If not, then you better get used to the smell.”<br />
<br />
The man hesitated for a moment, causing the driver to reach down to a syringe gun hanging off of his belt.  Everyone had been told ahead of time what would happen if you refused to wear your costume – you’d be injected with a sedative, forced into the costume, and marked with a scent that would let the others find you all that much quicker.<br />
<br />
Not that many people would resist, everyone knew the rules going in, but it was there as a ‘just in case’ due to this year’s rule.<br />
<br />
Knowing what would happen to him if he resisted, as well as the high likelihood that his new form’s offensive smell would help ensure he at least survived, the man took the costume and began putting it on.<br />
<br />
At first, the man looked like he was wearing an ill-fitting fursuit with baggy arms and fake cloth eyes.  Then he turned around and let the driver zip him up.  <br />
<br />
Immediately, the dull, artificial fur took on a rich sheen and the baggy cloth skin sucked in, forming perfectly to the contours of his body.  There was a cracking sound as the costume began to shrink.  Within seconds, the 6 foot tall man was down to 5 foot 6, then five feet, then four feet five.  He body began to lurch over as his hands turned to paws, legs shortened, and hips readjusted themselves to a quadrupedal form.<br />
<br />
It was as he passed 4 feet that his tail suddenly raised itself and poofed out in surprise.  The soon to be skunk let out a squeal and his paw hands shot to his crotch.  The sudden realization that you were watching him caused him to turn around to face you, eyes wide with a mixture of shock and… embarrassment?<br />
<br />
The van filled with the sulfurous smell of skunk spray, and at first you thought that was the source of the man’s shame – he’d gotten a whiff of himself and was embarrassed over the fact that, unless he managed to end up on the predator side of things, his new scent would prevent him from ever fitting in with polite society again.<br />
<br />
It was only as body continued to shrink, causing him to splay his arms out to the ground as he fell to a four legged stance, that you were able to get a brief glance at the thing he had been covering up.  Sitting between his legs wasn’t the small skunk cock that you’d expected, but a pink cunt that burrowed into his belly.<br />
<br />
Well, her belly now technically.  Obviously he wasn’t a seasoned participant, since gender changes were a known and frequent occurrence.  Still, you always changed back at the end.  With the new rules in place, this formerly human male would need to find a prey to devour.  If he didn’t, he’d been spending the rest of his life as a female skunk – a possibility made all the more real by the fact that the putrid smell that hung around her was sure to keep both predator and prey away from her.<br />
<br />
Plus, from the quick glance you’d gotten, her pussy had looked like it was swollen red with blood – a sign that she’d been given a costume of a female skunk in heat.  You’d been in that situation 2 years ago. Ending up as female velociraptor in a dinosaur themed party, you’d completely lost control of your body and ended up spending most of the party getting your brains fucked out of you.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t something you’d had any control over – you’d gotten lost in a waking dream of a male velociraptor, losing awareness of where your body was or what it was doing.  You’d only realized what was going on when the you’d felt a cock enter your slit, only for the mental image of getting fucked to be replaced by the physical reality of the act.  Then, as soon as it was over and your slit was full of raptor cum, you’d felt the heat return and reality fade away until your body had found another male to fuck it.<br />
<br />
Looking down former man – now a full, female skunk – you could see the same vacant look of lust filled fire in her eyes.  Hopefully for her, she’d find enough male skunks to satiate her heat before the two weeks were up.  Or one of the predators with a less developed sense of smell and taste would find her.  Otherwise, she’d be spending the rest of her life with a litter of kits suckling her teats while another grew in her belly.<br />
<br />
Her new body fully shaped by the costume, the likely soon to be forever skunk ran off into the woods in search of a mate, while the driver got back in the van.<br />
<br />
“Last one eh?” he said as he looked back and saw that you were the last of the van’s passengers.  He stepped on the gas and the van continued deeper into the forest.</p>
