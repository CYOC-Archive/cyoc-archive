<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff awoke to a searing white light. He recognized the sterile environment, still tormented by his last hospital visit. Quickly he felt himself up for any other changes. His body seemed mostly normal, well… new normal. His groin was bandaged again, but it was obviously flat. He had a new bandage on his lower abdomen though, probably from fixing the hernia.<br />
<br />
His parents were nowhere to be found, and neither was his sister. He had a bad feeling about ever seeing them again. They probably left him once they found out about his ehrm…  surgery. They weren’t the most liberal people.<br />
<br />
Hell his own sister still hadn’t figured out he was gay. Now that they knew his dick was gone he wasn’t too worried about that. Hell, who cared if he fucked boys now. At least it wouldn’t offend his folks.<br />
<br />
As he looked down his naked body, he wondered what they had done to save what was left of his junk. Having a pussy wasn’t ideal but it still meant having a sex life was possible.  “So… they fixed your cooter huh?” A voice said behind him. Jeff groaned and rolled over.<br />
<br />
It was Chris, standing there with his camera. In shock, Jeff sat up. He still looked pretty horrible though, even worse than he had before. Chris just grinned, walking around to stand beside Jeff’s bed.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn’t like Chris. Chris was in most of the same classes as him and tormented Jeff endlessly. There was always something wrong with Jeff in Chris’ eyes. Jeff hated Chris’ gay jokes most of all but couldn’t show it to not give him any credibility. Jeff said nothing.<br />
<br />
“You know I know, right? Everyone knew something was up when you didn’t show up to school for a week. And your parents acted like you never existed…” Chris trailed off. A week? Had he really been out that long?  <br />
<br />
Chris pointed at the camera. “Just because you got fixed doesn’t mean I won’t keep doing my job. Hey if I knew you were actually gay…”<br />
<br />
“Why are YOU here?” Jeff interjected. “I got it, you hate me, so get lost!”<br />
<br />
“Because I thought you might want to tell your best friend what happened. Plus I wanted to get some nice pictures of you naked. Trust me, they don’t look great… the catheter takes away from the whole image.” Chris said, taking several photos from different angles. It was disgusting how easily Chris took pleasure in humiliating someone.<br />
<br />
Jeff reached for the nurse call button, but Chris stopped him before he could get there. “Hey, hey, hey pretty boy we don’t want this to end too soon. Plus get rid of me and you’re all alone here.”<br />
<br />
Jeff knew he was right, and part of him did need company. “NUR…” He started screaming but Chris quickly shut him up with his big hand. <br />
<br />
“Calm down!” Chris shushed. “You got quite the pair of balls, baby, well not any more. Ha.” Baby? Jeff was intrigued, still he couldn’t answer with Chris’ can covering his mouth. “Fine you know what? The camera is gone. Just you and me. Promise not to yell and I’ll let go?” Chris continued. “Okay?”<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Jeff nodded. “So, start talkin?” Chris demanded, “You found your true self or somethin?” Jeff hated his sarcastic tone but didn’t feel the need to correct him, how could he explain what happened anyway?<br />
<br />
Without warning, Jeff broke down crying. As far as anyone else would have known, Chris had killed him. But the doctors told his parents Jeff’s penis skin had slipped out of his wound spontaneously. Chris laughed out loud.<br />
<br />
“Geez, first I find out you’re queer and then that ya own balls off?! Huh?! Oh shit… it is kinda funny…” he paused to wipe away tears. “You know if I knew you were gay, I wouldn’t have cracked as many jokes, right? I mean you’re kinda hot…” What did he just say?! “I mean don’t get me wrong, I still like girls but hey, you’re practically one anyway at this point!“ What he was saying stung, but Jeff couldn’t tell if he was being genuine. <br />
<br />
It didn’t matter anyway, a young male doctor walked through the door. “Ah, you’re awake, how are you feeling. I assume your boyfriend has filled you in?” Boyfriend? Jeff just ignored that, there was too much else going through his head. “No matter, it’s best you hear it from us anyway. I’m glad to tell you that there was only minimal damage to the neovagina. While it’s never great to have complications, you were remarkably lucky, Ms. Davies.” “It’s Mr. Davies.” Chris interrupted. Why did he care all the sudden? “Yes, of course. I’m sorry for the confusion Mr. Davies. You’re a very lucky man, your boyfriend Chris has been by your side since day one.” Jeff glanced at Chris in confusion. “In any case it’s best to take things slow and continue the course of your recovery as expected. You can be discharged today. Keep up the twice daily dilation. You two can consider penetrative intercourse after your checkup in a month. Please make an appointment at the front desk.” Without saying much else, the doctor turned and left. Jeff was stunned, staring daggers at Chris. <br />
<br />
“So when do you wanna head back to my place?” Chris asked.<br />
<br />
“Are you kidding me?” Jeff answered flatly. Chris rolled his eyes. “Dude, you have no idea what you’ve done. Your parents are never gonna take you back. Honestly, you’re lucky to have me. And just so you know, my mom already knows and doesn’t care.” Chris shrugged. <br />
<br />
“Besides I have plenty of space in my room, so they won’t care. They know I’m bi and I’m their only kid, anyway.” Jeff really didn’t have anywhere else to go, so reluctantly agreed. “Why’d you tell them I was your boyfriend anyway?” “Call it wishful thinking” Chris answered.</p>
