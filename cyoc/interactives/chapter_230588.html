<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle spent close to an hour washing himself, having begrudgingly accepted that all of these parts were his forever, he took the time to wash every inch of every leg, finding that he was now abnormally flexible compared to before his changes, he could practically turn a full 180 degrees to face reach his back legs. Doing this started to turn him on again, his mind running through the possibilities, he shuddered a little as he felt his cocks harden a little. <br />
<br />
Doing his best to ignore his runaway thoughts, he finished washing all of his legs, and dried off as much as he could. He walked over to his bedroom, and paused, should he get dressed? He stood there for a minute, and decided not to, he would eventually have to get used to all of this flesh, so he decided to go nude for the morning, at least until his mother got home. He walked out to the living room, noting that his feminine parts lifted him slightly in the cramped hallway, reacting to the width. <br />
<br />
Grabbing the left over pizza in the fridge, he sat down, regretting doing so for a moment after feeling both of his cocks crush against his ass and crotch respectively, he got as comfortable as he could, setting the pizza box on his plush forward ass he spent part of the morning watching tv. A thought was banging against his mind like a woodpecker. If he was that flexible, what else could he do?<br />
<br />
He tired to ignore the thought, but he kept imagining all sorts of sexy scenarios, after another hour of trying to ignore it, he finally gave in.<br />
<br />
“I wonder if I can....” He muttered, and started to try something, his front most pair of legs were just... right there, in front of him. Sure they were copies of a very young version of his mom, but they were attached to him, so he could just do what he wanted with them. The act of turning around in the shower had made him think of interesting things he could do with himself, and one of them was pressing on his mind really hard. <br />
<br />
Kyle discarded the box that he had placed on his front ass, having done so both out of convenience and to try and ignore it, and he started to caress that ass, he reached his hands down onto his thighs and wrapped his arms around them. They were thicker than he thought, he was just barely able to reach around them, and then he pulled them with him as he sat up. He hoped that what he was trying wouldn&#39;t hurt him, and it didn&#39;t, his legs followed him, ass pressed against his stomach, the rose into the air, feet kicking partially under his control, partially under instinctual reaction, his back pressed against the couch and the legs placed their thighs against the back of the couch. <br />
<br />
Kyle panted in lust, from his view point he was framed by two luscious thighs, and looking down he saw it in all of its glory, his front pussy, not to far away from him, the split in his crotch reaching almost halfway up his chest. He hadn&#39;t expected it to be this close, his new parts were much larger than he had estimated, and now he was faced with an opportunity he hadn&#39;t expected. He reached around with his hand, and wasn&#39;t able to touch it, the legs were in the way, he moved his arms around, and under the legs, hoping they wouldn&#39;t fall back down after he let them go, to his surprise he was able to keep his legs in position. <br />
<br />
“Am I really going to do this?” He shuddered with lust, hesitating to even touch his pussy, the sight of a really pussy was shocking. He never saw one in person before, let alone knowing that it&#39;s his, he couldn&#39;t muster the courage to touch it, and put his arms down at his sides just looking at it, admiring one of his six new womanhoods. Then something strange started happening, the legs were starting to move on their own, the leg to his right bounced, as if impatiently waiting for the boy to play with her. He barely noticed it, but after a few minutes, the womanly legs had enough of waiting, and made their move. Kyle didn&#39;t have time to react as the legs pressed themselves against his head, wrapped themselves around it and pulled, pressing his face right down into that pussy. Kyle tried to pull away, but the legs wouldn&#39;t obey him, his face smothered by the crotch flesh, he smelled the musky odor of a pussy waiting for some fun.<br />
<br />
Kyle shouted into his pussy, eventually his tongue tasted it, and that sent him over the edge, giving in he started to eat himself out, grabbing his cock with both hands and feeling the rear cock push into his ass his legs started to move like they had before, contracting their muscles as he was forced to eat until he reached orgasm, but the legs didn&#39;t let go, the let him up for breath, but then pushed him back in with a yelp. For the next half hour he was trapped by the continuous musings of his body parts, instead of horror, he felt delight, not only was he experiencing first hand a fetish for multiple limbs, but he was being dominated by them too. Finally the legs let him up, only to land straight down on his cock and continued his ride, two more orgasms his him, when they finally stopped.<br />
<br />
“Oh God....” Kyle panted, “What... what was that?” He moaned. All of his legs shuddered with delight, he quivered in ecstasy, wanting to believe that he had done all of that himself and that he was just overcome with lust. After catching his breath, he sat there preoccupied with thoughts of what just happened, was that him or were the legs starting to control themselves? As if on queue he was forced to stand up by the legs.<br />
<br />
“NO! YOU CAN&#39;T!” Kyle screamed as the legs moved by themselves, walking him over to the kitchen, his front most lifted themselves up and grabbed the disinfectant wipes in a pincer move with their feet, turning slightly to the right his right front pair grabbed the air freshener, both lifting and moving the cleaning goods back to Kyle. He stood there in shock, staring at the feet holding the supplies, they rocked themselves, shaking the supplies at him as if to say “Take this.” <br />
<br />
Kyle in shock just went through the motion, grabbing the supplies from the legs, they walked him over to the leather couch and bending him over to clean up after himself, he got to work, the ladies work with him as a team, all without his say, he whimpered, not understanding what was going on, he finished cleaning and they walked him back to the kitchen he replaced the cleaning goods and was walked back into the hall and into the shower. “STOP!” The legs continued to move on autopilot into the shower, opening the door for themselves, and turning on the shower. The grabbed the loofa on a stick and shook it at him like the cleaning supplies. <br />
<br />
He grabbed the loofa, standing there starting at it, his front most pair reached up and straddled his shoulders again presenting herself. The light bulb in his head clicked and he set about cleaning all of his pussies, drying off afterwards he thought he would have control again, but they moved their selves into the bedroom, opening drawers and pulling out sets of panties and shorts, and presenting them to him, he shakily followed their wants, dressing each of the now dominant legs they finally passed him his boxers and shorts and he dressed his center pair, they then started to walk him over to the living room. He started squirming, trying to take control the legs moved them into the center of the living room and sat down on the floor. <br />
<br />
The legs moved again, “NO! THIS IS MY BODY, YOU ARE PART OF ME! I&#39;M IN CONTROL!” The legs all at once reached themselves up, wrapping around him as if to hug him, and for the first time he heard the voice in the back of his head. <br />
<br />
“Oh Kyle.” Kyle froze, it sounded like a much younger version of his mother. “Don&#39;t you get it? You can&#39;t possibly work all of these legs by yourself. I&#39;m here too.”<br />
<br />
“No... please...” Kyle started to cry, this was even worse than before. The legs squeezed him harder, he sat their shaking as the voice continued.<br />
<br />
“Shhhhh. I&#39;m here, no I&#39;m not your mom, I&#39;m you, just your female parts, and there&#39;s a lot of me. Just relax. Shhhh.” His inner self started resting her legs a little lower setting themselves in a laying position around the upset Kyle. “Listen, I&#39;m not going to force you to do things all the time, but we need to start actually acknowledging each other. You had a clue that I was here, now you know. And don&#39;t worry too much, I am you, and damn was that kinky.” Kyle shuddred. “I know, hearing mom say that is weird isn&#39;t it, you&#39;ll get used to it, I&#39;m your Anima. You inner female you. Now that I&#39;ve got so much to work with, I can talk to you in your head.” <br />
<br />
Kyle sat there, he had lost control he thought. “No you haven&#39;t. I just pushed us to take care of some stuff, plus, we should be dressed a least, mom will be home in a few hours. And we usually lose track of time.” <br />
<br />
“So.... your me.” Kyle spoke<br />
<br />
“Yep, and you don&#39;t have to talk out loud, I can be like... and inner monologue. And hey, now we&#39;re twice as smart, since we can plan with each other.” Kyle sat staring at the legs. “Oh please, you know you wanted to try that, you were just to shy to play with me.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah..” Kyle thought. “But you didn&#39;t have to force me to move like that.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I knew you&#39;d just sit there stinking of sex, and you remember what mom said, clean up after ourselves right.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah... your right.” <br />
<br />
“Cool, now I&#39;m not going to move us like that again without talking to you. I&#39;m sorry I scared you.”<br />
<br />
Kyle sat there in silence for a minute. “So your me?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
“But my female side.”<br />
<br />
“Indeed.”<br />
<br />
Kyle tried to process this, meanwhile he heard her voice humming the closing tune to an anime they had watched yesterday. Kyle touched the ass in front of him. “Yes that&#39;s ours.” He pulled away his hand. “No, listen closely... I AM YOU. You can touch our ass, go ahead, don&#39;t be shy.” Kyle hesitantly reached down and touched his ass, “There you go.” He started rubbing it. “Feels good, yes?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it does.” Kyle admitted.<br />
<br />
“Good. Do you wanna go on a walk or something? We can&#39;t leg all of this sexiness just waste away, we&#39;re going to have to work out eventually.” Kyle groaned. “I know, but hey, we should keep these girls looking good.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah... Lets take a walk.” Kyle said<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s the spirit!” The legs bent an lifted him up. <br />
<br />
“HEY!” <br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry, let&#39;s go to the bedroom and get our shoes, I&#39;m pretty sure we have some slip on tennis shoes, I think we saw those yesterday.”<br />
<br />
“Okay.” Kyle was ushered over to the bedroom under his inner self&#39;s control, humiliated and kind of turned on again. <br />
<br />
“Yeah I know, kinda kinky right. Being dominated by your inner self.”<br />
<br />
“So.” Kyle thought pointedly “I can&#39;t just call you my inner self.”<br />
<br />
“Why not, I&#39;m you.”<br />
<br />
“No, you&#39;re not, you&#39;re part of me, but not me, if that makes sense.” The legs stopped, he didn&#39;t hear the voice for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
“Hey, um, can we... just get the shoes and...”<br />
<br />
“No, you have a good point. I&#39;m not you but also am you.” Kyle regretted saying anything. “I&#39;m not mad. I&#39;m just thinking. You can call me....” The voice paused for a minute or two. “Mandy.”<br />
<br />
Kyle sighed, relieved that this woman wasn&#39;t going to hurt him.<br />
<br />
“Why would I hurt us? I&#39;d get hurt too you know.”<br />
<br />
“Right. So... Mandy?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I know this is awkward. We&#39;ll make it work, come on, lets take that walk.” The legs moved again, opening the closet door.<br />
<br />
“You know I can do that with our hand right?” <br />
<br />
“Oh... Sorry.” Mandy let Kyle move the shoes into position, and she set their feet into the shoes, they were some of the most comfortable shoes he had ever owned. “I know, awesome right?” Kyle grabbed the keys to the apartment, and they made there way out of the door to take their walk.</p>
