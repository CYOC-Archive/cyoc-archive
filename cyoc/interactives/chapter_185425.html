<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>politely requesting no bestiality additions here -- it&#39;s not my intention. If you wanna write that stuff, there are plenty of animal-focused story ideas elsewhere that are all about it! :) Thanks.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On Friday evening, the younger brother noticed that Ethan was in a great mood after his swim meet. He listened to Ethan tell him about almost getting caught tiny in the showers -- causing him to giggle about his sense of amazing timing yet AGAIN -- and Ethan&#39;s impression of the new student Lucas, who sounded really cool. He&#39;d also scored some great times, and won a couple of races at the meet, and placed highly in a few others. For Eric, Friday had just been another day at school, though their first week of shared cocks was coming to a close, and he made sure to tell Ethan just how much he appreciated it, and wanted it to continue.<br />
<br />
Ethan had just hugged him, the affection real and heartwarming -- and told him that he wanted it to continue too, and that it was up to Eric if he ever wanted to stop.<br />
<br />
Life was good!<br />
<br />
The next day, Saturday, Eric had been wanting to spend his time chilling out, but in the morning when he got up, Ethan let him know that their elderly widower neighbour, Mr Reyes, had called late the previous night. He had asked if one of them could do some pet-watching while he had to go visit his daughter upstate.<br />
<br />
&quot;The whole day?&quot; Eric complained. &quot;What am I supposed to do over there? Why can&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got study to catch up on, I haven&#39;t had time for everything recently. He has a TV and I think some kind of streaming service, so you&#39;re not going to be bored, and he said he&#39;d give something as compensation when he gets back, so that&#39;s pocket money!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; he mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like dogs too. It&#39;ll be fun. Just knock on his door before 9.30, and he&#39;ll let you inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right.&quot; Eric shrugged, but then added on: &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll go, but I&#39;m taking our big cock, and I&#39;ll be keeping it until after I&#39;m back home, so that way I DEFINITELY won&#39;t be bored.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not much of a threat, you know I like being small!&quot; Ethan laughed, and he nudged his little brother. &quot;Just be polite, follow his rules, and whatever you do, don&#39;t leave a mess anywhere!&quot;<br />
<br />
Leave a mess? Not a chance, Eric was thinking to himself as he went to grab his backpack. I can take care of everything myself.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Settling in to the neighbour&#39;s house was easy. The pet that Eric had to watch was a young German Shepherd named Prince. Normally active and fun, the dog had just got back from the vet after having an operation and needed to recuperate, so he was spending most of his time sleeping. While Eric did like dogs, it was a relief that all he needed to do was check in on Prince every so often to make sure things were okay, and he could mostly just do whatever he wanted.<br />
<br />
Ethan had been right, Mr Reyes had a big screen TV and a lot of viewing options, but after a little while Eric became distracted and out of random curiosity started poking through Prince&#39;s toys and other items of pet ownership. Apart from a couple of spare collars and leads and a large carry-cage, there was also a pet harness. It looked like one of those used on particularly boisterous pets that were hard to control, and Eric couldn&#39;t help thinking it looked sorta like a canine full-body jacket.<br />
<br />
It was around that moment that he started to wonder: did this count as clothing?<br />
<br />
Because if it DID, then what would happen if ... ?<br />
<br />
A lightbulb switched on in Eric&#39;s mind, and he grabbed the harness, retrieved the ring from his backpack, and walked out to the hall mirror. Slipping it over his head, he managed to squeeze his arms through the front-leg holes, and he &#39;wore&#39; the harness. Concentrating, Eric was doubtful anything would happen, he was sure it was only meant for people, but ...<br />
<br />
... to his surprise ...<br />
<br />
... it worked!<br />
<br />
With a slight pressure, his tongue swelled and gently pushed against his teeth. Eric automatically opened his mouth and several inches of it slid out. Long, pink, flat, and with the distinctive canine seam down the centre, it hung down to somewhere just past his chin.<br />
<br />
Eric could only stare in amazement.<br />
<br />
He had a dog&#39;s tongue!<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t stay completely still, seeming to twitch and move a little on its own, and after a few seconds of observing, Eric could see -- and feel -- it doing the subtle in-out movement. Focusing, he drew it all the way back inside and shut his mouth. It took up a LOT more room, clearly not designed for a human, and though he could breath just fine, he had to concentrate to keep it there. Eric relaxed, letting go, and immediately his mouth opened and the tongue just flopped out and hung there.<br />
<br />
This was SO awesome!<br />
<br />
He tried it a few more times -- open, close, open, close -- amused by the image, and sensation, of it going in and out like a fleshy yo-yo. Then he tried to lick the tip of his nose, and instead the tongue flicked up and smeared the whole thing in saliva, causing him to giggle.<br />
<br />
Wandering through to the kitchen, panting softly as he went -- something he barely realised he was doing -- Eric looked for the snacks. Mr Reyes had left a few things for him; a couple packets of potato chips and some soda. Fetching a tall glass, he opened the soda bottle and poured some in. He set the glass on the bench, holding it flat with a hand, roughly a third full, and positioned his mouth over the top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s see if I can drink this without lifting it,&quot; he thought. &quot;This should be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
In front of his eyes, his tongue shot down into the bottom of the glass, in a quick lapping. Then again, and again, and several times more, each darting lick bringing a splash of soda into his mouth. He was doing it! Eric&#39;s face flushed in excitement and joy, but that quickly turned to humour. He could hear the steady blop-blop-blop of disturbed liquid, and he couldn&#39;t help thinking that it sounded EXACTLY like a dog drinking from a water bowl.<br />
<br />
Letting go of the glass, Eric coughed, slurping down the remaining soda on his oversized tongue, before breaking out in a fit of giggles.<br />
<br />
Too cool!<br />
<br />
What else could he do?<br />
<br />
Eager for further exploration, Eric went back to the harness, but this time he put this feet through the back leg holes. Not sure exactly how it would manifest, he pushed his pants down just a little bit, and lifted his shirt. Ring back on his finger, once again Eric focused and ... it happened.<br />
<br />
It felt weirder than any other swap so far. From his tail bone there was an odd pushing feeling and then the new body part kinda burst out, like it was breaking free. In a moment it blossomed into full length and he gazed with building elation as twitched experimentally and moved back and forth a couple of times.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got a tail!&quot; Eric whispered to himself gleefully, brushing a hand over the bushy fur. &quot;A dog&#39;s tail! Oh my god!&quot;<br />
<br />
One thing was obvious straight away -- a tail didn&#39;t really work with clothes. It was right above his butt-cleft and too low to sit over pants and underwear without some serious discomfort. The solution was easy. Eric just stripped them off and stowed them in his backpack. Nobody else was there, so what did it matter?<br />
<br />
Returning to the hall mirror, he admired his reflection from the side, dressed in only his tshirt and socks. First, he happily gave his long cock and teenage balls a light squeeze of appreciation. No way he&#39;d leave them out! Then the tail -- so cool! Like the tongue, it seemed to have a mind of its own, and would go back and forth almost at random without conscious decision, and ALSO like the tongue, with some concentration he could control it.<br />
<br />
Putting in the mental effort, Eric tried to wag it, as hard as he could. In moments it picked up speed, and then it was powering energetically left-to-right and back like an over-zealous windscreen wiper. The force was enough to make his butt wiggle lightly from side to side with the wagging motion, and his junk to jiggle as well. Eric was transfixed by the image, face pink, and his crotch semi-hard from the perfect weirdness of what he was seeing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, no regrets about my decision now,&quot; he laughed, the wagging tail subsiding, and he looked at the harness. &quot;What could I do next?&quot;<br />
<br />
Donning the harness again over his shoulders, this time Eric focused on his hands.<br />
<br />
Drawing inward, they morphed and narrowed, covering in fur. The ring was forced off his vanishing finger, and it dropped to the carpet as the digits squished and reshaped into pads and claws, the change stopping at his wrist, where the fur thinned and transitioned straight into human skin.<br />
<br />
Paws!<br />
<br />
Sitting down, he placed them on the carpet, and was amazed at how easy it felt to use them. It was possible to hold his weight with regular hands, of course, but his doggy paws felt just right. Standing, he carefully scooped up the ring with a claw and took it back through to leave it with his clothes. Swiveling the paws around, he just tested out the feel of them. At least they didn&#39;t need to be supervised like his tail, or his tongue -- Eric blinked and then blushed when he realised he was lightly panting again -- and he could move the individual digits easily enough. The down side was he had almost no grasping ability at all, the lack of an opposable thumb making object manipulation kinda hard.<br />
<br />
That didn&#39;t matter though, he&#39;d made the choice on purpose for fun! Feeling a little thirsty, Eric reached for the soda glass, forgetting that his &#39;hands&#39; weren&#39;t up to the task, and promptly knocked it off the lounge table. The remaining soda splashed on his tshirt hem, around the hip, on his right buttcheek, and onto his right sock as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooops!&quot; He muttered. Shrugging out of the shirt, and awkwardly pulling off his socks, Eric dumped them with the rest of his stuff into his backpack, then he somehow managed to scoop up the glass and carry it through to the kitchen. He placed it ito the sink, and was just looking for a paper towel to wipe himself down with, when he heard something terrifying.<br />
<br />
The front door opened, and a woman&#39;s voice called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, Mr Reyes! Housekeeping is here!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was the bustling sound of her placing her supplies on the carpet, and entering into the front hall of the apartment.<br />
<br />
Eric went white.<br />
<br />
No way! His clothes -- and the ring! -- were all in his backpack in the next room, which was adjacent to the front.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the harness itself was where he left it, in the hall.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t do anything without being seen, and if he wasn&#39;t careful, heard too!<br />
<br />
Making a snap decision, he grabbed the kitchen&#39;s rear door handle, managing to clumsily turn it between his paws, and quietly pulled it open. Slipping out through the gap, he tugged it back closed, and it pulled to with barely a sound.<br />
<br />
The yard was a smallish rectangle of grass with a couple of trees, but walled off from the neighbours, so he was thankfully safe from that, but ... a covered recycling bin was sitting near the door, and it seemed almost full. The kitchen windows also looked out onto the yard, so all Eric could do was hide. Heart beating rapidly, he ran across it and crouched behind the trunk of the only tree large enough for concealment. Feeling terrified and kinda silly at his risktaking finally backfiring, Eric took stock of what was going on.<br />
<br />
He was a naked 11 year old boy, with paws for hands, a long feathery tail, and an impressively large floppy cock. Panting lightly with stress and nerves, his tongue lolling as he peeked at the kitchen windows, Eric admitted to himself it was exciting as it was scary, and he started to understand -- this must be what Ethan felt with his little dick!<br />
<br />
While he was waiting, Eric was startled by a sound from the fence. To his surprise, crawling under from the NEXT neighbour over, was another dog! Alerted by activity in Mr Reyes yard, the visitor must have thought it was Prince and come over to play about. Clearly this yard-hopping was a common thing, but the new dog, smaller than the Alsatian, some kind of terrier, paused when it saw him.<br />
<br />
Scared he would be noticed, Eric called out to it softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here boy! Come!&quot; His voice sounded thick and a bit lispy because of his tongue, but it was enough. The terrier trotted over to greet him, but the body language was a bit weird. It didn&#39;t seem to know how to respond to him, the combination of human and canine features making it perplexed. At almost the same moment it reached him, the back door opened and the housekeeper emerged to deal with the trash. Without thinking, Eric pulled the dog in closer behind the tree with an arm, and then dropped to all fours, the position totally instinctive and natural to assume.<br />
<br />
His eyes were glued to the housekeeper, his half-hard cock swaying in the air. <br />
<br />
For a few seconds he watched as she lifted and separated the contents, his fear intense, before he felt something ... odd.<br />
<br />
A cold wet nose brushed against him, and then after not a second&#39;s hesitation more, it pushed firmly RIGHT UP between his buttcheeks.<br />
<br />
Eric wanted to yelp in surprise, but all he did was bite his lip in shock. His tail lifted automatically, and he could feel the terrier nuzzle in as close as it could get, the air blasting against his sensitive nethers as it smelled him in greeting. Eric froze in place, unable to process the bizarre but horrendously exciting moment, but his body reacted for him. A front paw scratched at the tree trunk in agitation, and he was panting even faster, his cock stiffening and lengthening, heart thundering. He had to stop himself from making sound -- actually whining -- and his face was bright red at his impulsive canine behaviour in response to the other dog sniffing his butt.<br />
<br />
After a number of seconds of the strangest experience of his life, the terrier pulled away, and Eric&#39;s nerves calmed, his eyes still on the housekeeper fiddling with the bin. The relief was quickly gone though, because then he felt a tongue! It was lapping over the side of his right buttcheek, the sticky drying soda at just the right place to reach. He bit his lip again, and his confused penis thickened, approving of the feeling of wetness on his cheek. Pleasure shot through him, and he tried to just stay still, stay quiet, as the soft skin was bathed by a smooth licking tongue.<br />
<br />
Lick after lick after lick -- it wasn&#39;t easy, because it felt INCREDIBLE.<br />
<br />
Finally, the housekeeper was done, and she trooped back inside with the recycling. Immediately, though with a definite undertone of regret, Eric pushed the other dog away, his mind a mixture of weirded out and horny embarrassment. Catching his breath while he waited for the housekeeper to finish inside, Eric tried to keep the terrier close, and although it tried to sniff his butt again, clearly interested in &#39;reading&#39; more about the odd dog-human -- and a part of him WANTED to let it -- he instead kept it away from his hindquarters. It only took a few minutes for her to do her circuit through the apartment, and then he heard the front door close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god!&quot; Eric thought, and he skittered across the yard to the back door, his big hardon waggling as he moved, tail swishing behind him. Gripping the handle again, he twisted it, but ... it didn&#39;t budge.<br />
<br />
Locked!<br />
<br />
The housekeeper had done her diligence before leaving, and even more nervous now, Eric began to search for another way in. There was a growing fear that he would be stuck outside, discovered later by Mr Reyes or even Ethan, naked in the yard with inexplicable dog parts. He was scared, but he did manage to find one way in -- the bathroom window! It was small, and high up, but ... maybe?!<br />
<br />
Laying his arms onto the sill, he hauled himself as high as he could, his paws nearly useless for climbing. His legs pushed on the wall, trying to find purchase, and while he was clinging on, he slipped his right paw in, and batted at the latch, to loosen it, wishing all the while he had real fingers. After a few slaps, it came free, and Eric pushed on the frame with a shoulder as he struggled not to lose his balance.<br />
<br />
It ground open just enough to fit his slender torso, and going arms and head first, Eric wiggled in. His useless paws dangled while he shimmied through, his butt waving around, legs kicking at air, tail jaunting about with abandon, and he flushed again, feeling very much like an actual pet trying to break into his master&#39;s house. With a thump, he dropped onto the side of the bath, his claws scrabbling softly as he righted himself, and there was a huge wave of relief.<br />
<br />
Inside!<br />
<br />
Hurrying through the apartment, Eric was intent on getting the ring back, until he passed by the hall mirror and got a glimpse of himself.<br />
<br />
A cute dog-boy with a great big teenage stiffy pulsing in the air -- his cock had LOVED this adventure.<br />
<br />
The image was too powerful to resist.<br />
<br />
No intention of wasting time, Eric plopped himself in front of the mirror. His legs folded under, his tail behind him, his paws on the carpet -- exactly the way a dog might sit. Leaning down, his tongue shot out and with it, the simple realisation: he could go MUCH further! It reached his nuts, and Eric began to vigorously go to town as he washed his own crotch. From thigh to thigh, he slathered all of it, back and forth in a wet smooth ecstacy, with the oversized tongue lavishing particular attention on his scrotum, feeling his balls joggle and move from each amazing motion. His thighs were spread for maximum access, and Eric grunted in commendation, his new awareness of this activity&#39;s joy giving him a whole new gratitude as he spent the next couple of minutes just ... licking.<br />
<br />
Then the main course.<br />
<br />
It was the same as always, but once Eric felt the extra length of his tongue curl around his thickened cock, things became better. He wrapped as much of it around the length as he could, and with slow bobbing movements, felt the mindblowing sensation of so much shaft dragging across so much extra tongue. It was almost like a masturbating hand inside his mouth, a gripping tendril of a glove with a slick damp surface, and Eric&#39;s eyes were nearly rolling back. His head rose and fell, and the ridiculous perfection of his impossible blowjob was too much to last more than thirty seconds, before he began to shoot. His balls contracted, and several volleys of blasting cum shot into his mouth, and Eric was blissfully swallowing, his tail wagging like crazy and thumping on the carpet.<br />
<br />
Finishing it, he sat up, giving his balls one final &#39;thank you&#39; lick first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess Ethan was right about his small cock. The scary part DOES make it fun,&quot; he thought, staring at his -- totally awesome and fucking cool! -- reflection as he mulled it over, &quot;and he was also right about today. Best decision ever, and I get pocket money for it too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wandering back through to his backpack, his tail wagging in leftover happiness from the orgasmic afterglow, he was relieved to find it untouched, and the ring still in place. While his brain was telling him the sensible course was to change back now and eliminate any further risk, Eric knew that there was no way he was going to do that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot; He smiled to himself. &quot;I love this. Not changing until I have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting himself on the couch, legs spread, his tail curved upward, swiping aimlessly across his soft crotch like a feather duster. His dick twitched, and he scratched lightly at the couch upholstery with a paw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got a lot more exploring to do with this tongue -- and with this tail,&quot; he grinned, &quot;and only a couple of hours to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Alfonso Reyes was a few minutes early getting in, and when he opened the door, he was surprised to find Eric Morales emerging from the hallway. His face was flushed, his hair mussed, and his clothes seemed messy -- was his shirt on backwards?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Mr Reyes!&quot; The boy put down the harness, like he hadn&#39;t realised he was carrying it. &quot;I- ... I was, uh, just thinking about walking Prince a little before you got back, but, I guess not, haha!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Eric. He hasn&#39;t been any trouble, has he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir, everything was fine. He was well behaved, just slept a lot.&quot; Eric gratefully took the couple of bills as payment from the old man, and quickly fetched his backpack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good. He needs to heal.&quot; Mr Reyes nodded. &quot;Thanks for doing this, Eric. Hope it wasn&#39;t too boring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was no problem.&quot; Eric walked out the front door, waving to his neighbour, who smiled and waved back. &quot;I had fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe it was too much fun, he considered, as he went back home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I know how Ethan feels,&quot; the younger brother admitted to himself. &quot;I would have been happy staying that way for ages. That was an awesome adventure, but ... I should be really careful about becoming Dog-Boy again!&quot;</p>
