<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trepeeset finally awoke around noon. Finally getting dressed with a different (non-ripped) <br />
pair of pants, Trepeeset wandered back into the forest. In the span of one day, his life had <br />
completely changed. His dead father gave him a magical medallion that allowed to him to <br />
turn into any man or animal, he flew as an owl, his father appeared to him in a dream and <br />
asked him to avenge his death, he dug up his dead father to transform into him and look at <br />
his memories, and in the process he found out that his mother was a Pale Woman. He <br />
shook his head, now understanding why Pocohono never mentioned anything about <br />
Trepeeset's mother, except for her death.<br />
<br />
Hearing a rustling in the trees, Trepeeset looked up. He saw Chotsalak lounging on a <br />
sturdy tree branch, smoking a pipe of marijuana. He seemed at peace. That made one of <br />
them.<br />
<br />
Trepeeset climbed the tree up to Chotsalak. Sitting up, he made room for Trepeeset. &quot;You <br />
look like you've had a rough night,&quot; Chotsalak observed.<br />
<br />
Trepeeset shook his head. &quot;You have no idea. You still use that crap?&quot; Trepeeset said, <br />
looking at the pipe Chotsalak had in between his lips.<br />
<br />
He took the pipe out. &quot;You want some?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a few puffs Trepeeset began to calm down. Eventually the entire story spilled out, <br />
from Trepeeset's father to his mother. Chotsalak was rapt. &quot;Your mother is a Pale Woman?&quot; <br />
he asked, incredulously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Trepeeset said. He held his arm against Chotsalak's. His skin was a few shades <br />
lighter than his friend's, showing his Pale Man roots. He had never noticed that before. <br />
Staring at his arm, he changed into Pocohono, watching his skin darken. <br />
<br />
A startled Chotsalak nearly fell out of the tree. &quot;Don't do that!&quot; he cried. <br />
<br />
Remembering what happened to Pocohono's knee, Trepeeset quickly changed back to <br />
himself before the changes hit below his waist. &quot;I am sorry, friend. But look at what has <br />
happened to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chotsalak blew a few smoke rings. &quot;Look, friend, I think things will be fine. Once we get <br />
back to defending against the Tadafek and the Pale Man, you will not be thinking about <br />
such things.&quot; Trepeeset remained silent. Chotsalak looked at him. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trepeeset shook his head. &quot;I don't think I can fight the Pale Man anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chotsalak's brow furrowed. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because my mother is one! I mean ... was one! I just ... I cannot!&quot; Trepeeset cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;They steal our land!&quot; Chotsalak roared. Several birds flew away in fright. &quot;They kill our <br />
game! They rape our women!&quot; Chotsalak shoved Trepeeset. &quot;What sort of warrior are you?! <br />
They are demons, and you defend them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trepeeset shoved Chotsalak back. &quot;SOME of them are! The rest are good people! There <br />
were two men that tried to help my father when he was shot. And my mother, Beth!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chotsalak crossed his arms. &quot;While they may do good, they still steal our land. They must <br />
be stopped.&quot; Chotsalak looked at his friend, who was looking more and more plaintive. <br />
Trepeeset buried his head in his hands, looking like he was about to cry. Chotsalak sighed. <br />
&quot;Look,&quot; he said. &quot;There is one Pale Man you must kill. The man who killed Medicine Man <br />
Pocohono.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trepeeset nodded. &quot;Weasel,&quot; he muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trepeeset looked at Chotsalak. &quot;Short, fat, brown, and hairy,&quot; he said with contempt for his <br />
father's killer. &quot;I call him Weasel.&quot; Even though Trepeeset could not at the time access <br />
Pocohono's memories, the image was burned into Trepeeset's memory. He would likely <br />
never forget his sinister face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. So what will you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trepeeset shrugged. &quot;We need to find him, somehow. I do not know where the Pale Man <br />
camp is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chotsalak looked thoughtful. &quot;One will turn up soon. You can be a bird and follow him and <br />
find out where the rest of the Pale Men lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trepeeset nodded again, then looked Chotsalak in the eyes. &quot;WE can be birds and fly in <br />
search of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chotsalak's eyes widened. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trepeeset took the medallion off his neck and handed it to Chotsalak. &quot;Really.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at Trepeeset. &quot;Are you sure? This is supposed to be your quest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is my quest. But I will need your help along the way, friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chotsalak smiled. &quot;I would be honored to help you, friend.&quot; He looked at the turquoise <br />
medallion. &quot;So which spirits do you have in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An owl, a gopher, and my father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chotsalak kept looking at the medallion. &quot;But what happens when I take it off? You need to <br />
use it as well.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can take it off, but you cannot Change back until you put it back on. And if you take <br />
it off, the animal's instincts get stronger.&quot; At Chotsalaks quizzical look, Trepeeset said &quot;I <br />
learned that when I was in my father's body and I had the stone in my hand. I could feel <br />
the magic in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chotsalak was silent for a few moments. Then he slowly placed the medallion around his <br />
neck, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and concentrated on growing wings. Trepeeset <br />
gasped as his friend shrunk on the branch, growing feathers. His arms melded into wings, <br />
and his legs shortened into sharp talons. Chotsalak's eyes grew large on his face as his <br />
mouth hardened into a beak. Now an owl, he shook violently, trying to free himself from <br />
the clothing he was wearing before. Placing his hand behind the bird, Trepeeset prevented <br />
Chotsalak from falling off the branch. He grasped Chotsalak's top and threw it down to the <br />
ground. His breechclout fell off on its own. <br />
<br />
Now freed, Chotsalak let out a mighty &quot;Hoooooooot!&quot; and shot into the air in a brown <br />
streak. Trepeeset watched in wonder, now knowing the feelings Chotsalak was having <br />
when he first saw Trepeeset Change. And Chotsalak now knew the feelings Trepeeset had <br />
when he first flew. Trepeeset smoked some more from Chotsalak's pipe, seeing the owl fly <br />
by occasionally.<br />
<br />
Chotsalak flew for a much longer time than Trepeeset's first time. Eventually, he returned <br />
to the tree. Chotsalak tried to land on the branch, but missed. He fell to the ground below. <br />
Trepeeset, now quite high, giggled uncontrollably at the sight. Chotsalak's owl body grew <br />
as the feathers retreated back inside. Trepeeset laughed hard as Chotsalak reappeared <br />
face-down, his bare butt in the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing,&quot; Chotsalak gasped, sitting up. &quot;I could fly! I was a bird!&quot; He suddenly <br />
covered up, realizing he was naked. &quot;Umm, can you toss me my clothes, friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, your clothes?&quot; Trepeeset said with a smirk. &quot;Here they are,&quot; he said, throwing them <br />
away from Chotsalak and deeper into the forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you...&quot; Chotsalak growled. &quot;Did you smoke all of my grass?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trepeeset took another deep rip and exhaled. &quot;Now I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chotsalak tried to look angry. &quot;Oh, your medallion?&quot; he echoed, and feigned a deep throw <br />
into the woods. But eventually a smile broke through on Chotsalak's face. The joy of flight <br />
broke through all other emotions. &quot;I can't believe I was flying. This is a wondrous <br />
medallion,&quot; he gushed, holding it in his hand. He gathered his clothes and quickly got <br />
dressed. &quot;I don't know what we will do with our clothes when we Change, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Trepeeset said, climbing down clumsily from the tree. &quot;I don't have many more <br />
clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chotsalak handed back the medallion and they both walked back to the village, Chotsalak <br />
smiling widely and chattering about his flight.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The rest of the day passed quickly: the marijuana helping Trepeeset keep his mind off of <br />
his troubles. However, Trepeeset had another nightmare that night: he was attacked by <br />
wolves as tall as he was with shining white fur and blood red eyes. He awoke with a start in <br />
his teepee and found it impossible to get back to sleep.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he decided to take a flight as an owl to calm himself. If it worked for Chotsalak, it <br />
works for him. He reached for his medallion, which he took off and placed next to him <br />
before he fell asleep. It was gone!<br />
<br />
In a panic, Trepeeset searched his teepee. It was nowhere to be found. Dashing from his <br />
teepee, he entered Chotsalak's teepee to wake him up. He opened the teepee and there <br />
was no one in it. A scowl crept across Trepeeset's face as he realized where his medallion <br />
had gone to. Chotsalak had taken it!<br />
<br />
Trepeeset stormed out of Chotsalak's home and back to his own teepee. He would really <br />
give it to Chotsalak in the morning. He wouldn't have minded lending it to him again, but <br />
he just took it! Angrily, he laid down in his teepee and eventually fell asleep once again.</p>
