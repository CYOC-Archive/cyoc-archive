<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hello I&#39;m Marcus from Transdem Labs. We have received reports that our beta test product has been misbehaving. Attempts at remote updating have failed and we would like to take a look, do you mind if I come in?<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly recalled the corner of his room, and the broken machine that he had completely forgotten about and left untouched. &quot;Yes Marcus, of course.&quot; Jeff said without question, silently leading the way to his bedroom. The final programming update had set anyone within range to be very cooperative when Transdem arrived and wait patiently. <br />
<br />
Marcus grunted in sadness at the sight of the completely destroyed machine but without hesitation he set to work. Pressing several buttons on his wristwatch the Chronivac pieced itself together and righted itself on Jeff&#39;s desk. A few more buttons and the error log, Jeff&#39;s profile, and all the AI modifications popped up. After sifting through the wreckage of Jeff&#39;s original request Marcus eventually turned to Jeff and said, &quot;Well I identified the issue and was able to correct the damages caused to the machine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff chimed in cheerily. &quot;Thank you Marcus, I&#39;m pretty good with computers but that one was beyond my expertise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus scowled, grabbed the emitter and scanned Jeff. After punching in a few commands and pulling the trigger, Jeff&#39;s eyes slowly widened with growing terror. Marcus turned off the AI satisfaction and normalcy effects and Jeff was realizing the full ramifications of his actions. <br />
<br />
Seeing that he had Jeff&#39;s full and undivided attention Marcus continued his job, &quot;Jeff Hodges, Access to our beta tester program was granted on the condition that you agree to the End User License Agreement and follow all instructions either written or verbal. Due to your violation of this agreement all Transdem Labs property is to be immediately returned and you will not be considered eligible for beta testing for a period of 5 years. Our protocols state that we can leave things in either of the following states of your choosing, A) The last command entered, executed as initially requested, or B) The state you were in before I arrived. When making this choice the subject is to be mentally where they were prior to entering the command. Check.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s brow furrowed, &quot;Wait! You&#39;re taking the machine and going to leave me as either a 16 year old who became twice as hairy as my father over the course of a school day, or a 26 year old who was 16 a day ago but everyone&#39;s cool with it. This is ridiculous! The machine crashed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus sighed heavily. &quot;IF you read the instructions you would have seen the numerous warnings to check for updates to the client before attempting to process transformations through the server. It would have also warned that failure to do this may result in transformations processing over extended durations erratically. This is a violation of the EULA in and of itself but could be overlooked and easily corrected. HOWEVER, You then threw a temper tantrum and attempted to destroy the machine you were given to test. AT THAT MOMENT you terminated our agreement and the only reason we are here is because the machine needs to be recovered and was not responding to our commands to teleport it home.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blood drained from Jeff&#39;s face, &quot;I..I&#39;m sorry. I was excited but it crashed on me after promising me really cool things and I was upset, a hormonal teenager... You&#39;ve got to turn me back to normal or give me a high school diploma and work experience or college credit... I can&#39;t suddenly look like a college kid overnight if everyone is going to think I&#39;m a freak for it, and I can&#39;t stay an adult if I&#39;m just going to have lost a decade of my life! I can&#39;t decide between those two scenarios! They both suck! If you cant turn me back completely, can you turn me back into a 16 year old but make everyone okay with my new appearance?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus was moved by Jeff&#39;s pleas, but couldn&#39;t do anything outside these protocols without risking his own job. Marcus began typing things into his watch device &quot;Your inability/unwillingness to decide has been noted and as such I am given the latitude to decide for you. Company guidelines state that I am to prioritize protecting the company, which on first thought would mean leaving you a happy hairy adult idiot but if someone scans you with another chronivac, they will see you have been aged with the AI system as a company instituted failsafe which would encourage people to pry, and things could get messy if we are accused of stealing a decade from a child... So 2 years of being a social outcast it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! No. Don&#39;t do this to me! I&#39;m already treated like shit in school, don&#39;t make it worse!&quot; Jeff was mortified and beginning to sob...<br />
<br />
Marcus&#39; hands were tied in that this transformation will be carried out, however... &quot;There is one option... it has its own issues but it will get you access to a transformation of your choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked up hopefully, &quot;Anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically, you ARE an adult right now. So you may register for Transdem Research Group, an entity separate from Transdem Labs. Both are subsidiary companies of Transdem International... But after taking part in a research experiment you will be left in whatever state you are in physically and mentally a hybrid of your old and new mind so you can answer their questions. They let you request a single transformation with one of their technicians. Most just say revert back to normal or forget the experience but maybe you can word the request more carefully and get yourself back to normal... Going through their experiments may be rough, they will be treating you like a fully consenting adult, because that&#39;s what you are right now...<br />
<br />
If you want this, I&#39;ll let you register before you become 16 again, but I&#39;ve already been here too long and need to return so now or never.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot; Jeff said. &quot;When can I start?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once you sign up you can&#39;t back out.&quot; Marcus cautioned... After getting an irritated glance from Jeff he used his watch to make the paperwork appear, Jeff signed without reading anything and after Marcus scanned the documents with his watch, it glowed green and a collar materialized which Marcus affixed to Jeff&#39;s neck. &quot;This&#39;ll teleport you to them when you are needed and its invisible to anyone but participants and Transdem employees.&quot; Marcus pointed his watch to the Chronivac which flashed and began processing. Within a moment Jeff was reverted back to his original profile, and seconds later he had the pelt and permanent beard shadow of a hairy 35 year old.<br />
<br />
&quot;You agreed to 5 trials meaning you only have 5 chances to get it right. Trials are being started constantly and only last a week so it shouldn&#39;t be too long till you are fully back to normal but remember that your appearance will be a shock to anyone who knows you. Good luck kid.&quot; Marcus pushed a button on his watch and faded out of existence, Jeff ran to the Chronivac the instant Marcus was gone but it faded out the same way along with the only copy of his original profile.</p>
