<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>There&#39;s been a mix-up regarding who certain characters are supposed to be. But I&#39;ll be adapting them as best as I can.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Herman and Jason had gotten used to living with each other in a rather symbiotic way. They took turns with the chores and cooking in their apartment. This even extended to after their conversion into an orca and a great white shark respectively, though they did need to take their new tails and heights into account. The two of them would have had been perfectly find just living by themselves. But with their conversions came the mating instincts of their new species, which had slowly opened them up to bisexuality.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Madam Matryoshka had found them a pair of women who were also wanting to become an orca and a great white shark. The two of them happened to be hardcore lesbians so at least it would put them on equal ground. They admitted having STDs, but something always sounded a little off about how they got them. But anyways, they will be meeting the pair at their apartment. &quot;Now, Jason, don&#39;t try to rush straight to the sex,&quot; said Herman, &quot;This is going to still be awkward for them so we need to patient.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m the impatient one?&quot; asked Jason teasingly, &quot;I seem to recall someone complaining about there not being enough &#39;whale tail&#39; available.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there wasn&#39;t,&quot; said Herman with a mock huff, &quot;There are more sharks than orcas around. How is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason shrugged and said, &quot;I guess once people learned that they can become shark Animalians without drowning, they became more open to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eventually, there was a knock on the door and Herman opened it. The two ladies waiting for them were more stunning than they expected. Moxie the shark was wearing a sports bra and very short gym shorts that were neon yellow and almost looked like a two-piece swimsuit. The uncovered skin allowed her to shone off her very muscular and toned body. Her long black hair was in a braid that was draped over one shoulder. She gave Herman a sultry grin and asked, &quot;You ever seen a shark&#39;s eyes, chief?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Moxie, did you have to use that line?&quot; groaned Starla. The orca woman was wearing a navy blue halter top, which showed off her abs. She wore a skirt of the same color, though it just grazed her knees. Her brown hair was shorter than her friend&#39;s, but it had a few star-shaped hairclips in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we&#39;ve given worse lines when we performed,&quot; said Moxie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt the guys watching were interested in what we were saying, even if they could hear it,&quot; said Starla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, won&#39;t you come in?&quot; asked Herman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Starla before walking through the door. She walked over to Jason and said, &quot;Hi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you in person,&quot; said Jason.<br />
<br />
Herman closed the door as Moxie walked in, taking the time to admire her toned ass. &quot;So, when you said &#39;performing&#39;, did you mean-&quot; started Herman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s no big secret now,&quot; said Moxie, &quot;Me and Starla used to be strippers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Herman, surprise by Moxie&#39;s cadence.<br />
<br />
&quot;We came from a town were being lesbians kept you from having good jobs,&quot; said Starla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry about that,&quot; said Jason, &quot;There are more understanding towns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know, but we actually loved stripping,&quot; said Moxie, &quot;We just felt we had a lot of wild oats to spread.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though we only did solo performances or with each other,&quot; said Starla, &quot;Any guy would have to get a lap dance from someone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...that would be an easy way to pick up those STDs,&quot; said Jason.<br />
<br />
Moxie and Starla exchanged guilty looks before Starla said, &quot;Actually, we lied about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; asked Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we were embarrassed to tell what our real problems were and we wanted to bond with you quick so we made that part up,&quot; said Starla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what did you have?&quot; asked Herman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad implants,&quot; said Moxie, &quot;The owner of our strip club thought people were getting bored with watching the two women who won&#39;t touch anyone else. So he set us up to plastic surgery for better tits and asses. And we always wanted bigger curves so we went along with it. Turns out the guy he sent us to wasn&#39;t as good as he said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How bad was it?&quot; asked Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the implants weren&#39;t made of silicon. That&#39;s all you would want to know,&quot; said Starla, &quot;We are sorry about that lie. It&#39;s not so easy to say you&#39;ve had junk put in your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean asides from junk food, smoking, and drugs?&quot; asked Herman in a teasing tone, &quot;It really isn&#39;t that bad a lie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least you were willing to admit it from the start,&quot; said Jason, &quot;As long as you aren&#39;t lying about anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, everything else is the truth,&quot; said Moxie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially about us wanting to stay together,&quot; said Starla, looking lovingly at Moxie. Even if they chose separate species, their bond was still strong after their conversions.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Moxie and Starla were still rather sore from having their implants removed. As grateful as they were to have that garbage removed from their bodies, it still hurt. What also stung was the bill they had to pay for the implant removal. It was lessened by them being Project Phoenix volunteers, but it was still steep. They didn&#39;t have much money left, but hopefully they&#39;ll get new jobs in Animalia. But more importantly to them, they&#39;ll be getting converted and getting rid of the pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon, we&#39;re both going to be big, busty sharks,&quot; said Moxie, trying to be upbeat despite the soreness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I&#39;ve changed my mind about that,&quot; said Starla.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Moxie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I heard there&#39;s already a former porn star who became a shark named Starla,&quot; said Starla, &quot;That would be too confusing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about that edict thing?&quot; asked Moxie.<br />
<br />
&quot;The edict is against cross-species breeding not relationships,&quot; said Starla, &quot;And I don&#39;t think we can knock each other up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless we go herm,&quot; said Moxie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you?&quot; asked Starla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I&#39;m fine with just being a girl,&quot; said Moxie, &quot;So what are you gonna be then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Orca,&quot; said Starla, &quot;I always liked them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just because of Jason?&quot; asked Moxie teasingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just a convenience to everyone,&quot; said Starla, &quot;Everyone gets what they want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Starla the killer whale,&quot; said Moxie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I might go by my birth name again,&quot; said Starla.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a moment,&quot; said Jason, who had been listening to the girls give their recap, &quot;Your name isn&#39;t really Starla?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it&#39;s Arlene,&quot; said Starla, &quot;My old boss thought my old name didn&#39;t have enough &#39;star quality&#39;. I just found it catchy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your name&#39;s not really Moxie?&quot; asked Herman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually it is,&quot; said Moxie, &quot;My parents regretted giving me that name...among other things.&quot; She looked rather sad at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that doesn&#39;t matter now,&quot; said Herman, &quot;So go on with your story.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Eventually, Moxie and Arlene (as Starla will be calling herself from now on) were led to a changing room and give two flasks, one with orca milk and the other with shark milk. &quot;I know orcas make milk too, but sharks?&quot; asked Moxie with bemusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are dinosaur babes with boobs two times bigger than your head,&quot; said Arlene, &quot;Does shark milk really seem that unusual?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point to you,&quot; said Moxie, &quot;You could still go shark with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I&#39;m gonna be whaling you up the wall,&quot; said Arlene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t orcas actually porpoises?&quot; asked Moxie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t start that,&quot; said Arlene flatly.<br />
<br />
Without further ado, each woman drank up their milk. Quite soon, the changes started affecting them. They both moaned as their bodies started feeling more energized. Eventually, they started growing bigger, muscles filling out. Their breasts quickly healed their surgical wounds before growing larger. As they filled up more, their shirts started ripping, revealing the whiteness on their fronts. But while Arlene was turning black in other areas, Moxie was turning grey. Their dorsal fins ripped through the backs of their shirts, causing the remains of both shirt and bra to fall from both.<br />
<br />
Moxie and Arlene grinned at each other, showing the sharpening teeth that was filling their mouths. Pretty soon, their faces started pushing out into snouts. While Moxie&#39;s nostrils mostly stayed where they were, Arlene&#39;s nostrils moved to the top of her head to become a blowhole. Their tails tore apart their pants, which were already straining from their growing asses and hips. Their feet had become flipper-like and webbing had appeared between their fingers. The pair admired themselves in the mirror. Moxie had become a rather buff anthro shark and Arlene was certainly no less fit as an anthro orca.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I&#39;m ripped,&quot; said Moxie, flexing an arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never had abs like these,&quot; said Arlene, rubbing a hand along her toned stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we never had boobs like these either,&quot; said Moxie hefting up her new breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than what that quack tried to do by far,&quot; agreed Arlene, massaging her own tits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want me to check if they&#39;re supposed to be?&quot; asked Moxie with a lecherous grin.<br />
<br />
Arlene smiled back and said, &quot;By all means, I want a thorough examination.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot; asked Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you know,&quot; said Moxie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t just stop the story there,&quot; protested Herman, &quot;Not when it was just getting to the good part.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, we&#39;re saving that for when we have our big night,&quot; said Moxie in a teasing voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which won&#39;t be right away,&quot; added Arlene, &quot;What kind of girls would we be if we wanted sex on the first date?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason turned to Herman and said, &quot;Herman, I do believe these two are trying to tease us out of our wits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never thought that would be so effective before now,&quot; said Herman, &quot;These two are definitely going to be a handful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than you think, handsome,&quot; said Arlene teasingly.</p>
