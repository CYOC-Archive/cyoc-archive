<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Texas is well-known for having hot, arid weather most of the year. In fact, many Texans had never seen snow in their home state. So when the Big Freeze hit during February, Texas was woefully unprepared for it. Not only were roads and highways frozen up, but the power grid couldn&#39;t keep up with the sudden energy demand of heaters that have previously seldom been used. It was safe to say that this was something many Texans have not dealt with in their lifetimes.<br />
<br />
Even Dinosaur City wasn&#39;t expecting this much snow. One of the reasons Dinotopians had decided to build their city here was because it was warm year-round. Fortunately, dinosaurs aren&#39;t as coldblooded as modern reptiles. One thought of reasoning behind that was that their bodies were so large that it would take at least two days for their bodies to adjust to temperature changes. And since dinosaur fossils have been discovered in areas which would have been near the polar regions during the relevant ages, that meant that some dinosaurs had to have been warmblooded.<br />
<br />
In any case, Animalians are not purely coldblooded, even those derived from modern reptiles. They can maintain their own body temperatures as much as humans can, though they are more sensitive to coldness than them. As such, there has been a major spike in demand for winter clothing designed for Dinotopians. And fortunately for them, Dinosaur City was modernly-designed than its stone age look suggested. They had a functional power grid when the Big Freeze came, though a lot of snow had to be shoveled out.<br />
<br />
And while many Dinotopians were more liberal, that didn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t feel pity for their unfortunate neighbors. They cooperated with Glen Rose to provide needed supplies to those who were hit worst by this unfamiliar coldness. Of course, these were short-term solutions. A more long-term solution was getting the power grid working again, and that would require an awful lot of money. Fortunately, there was one way that Dinotopians could build up a lot of money fast.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Many Dinotopians were still single after their conversions and several of the newer Dinotopians didn&#39;t have a special someone yet. So while it was in the same month as Valentine&#39;s Day, this would be a good time for another Bachelor/Bachelorette auction. All the money would be going to helping other charities who are helping out during the Big Freeze. It was hard to say if any of the dates being auctioned would lead into serious relationships. Although Jill and Beauregard was certainly a shining example of such a pairing.<br />
<br />
Among those ladies currently waiting for their turn to be bid was Stacey Sharpe. One might argue she was a little too young since she was almost 17. But she was double-dosed so she was considered a legal adult, even if she had another year of high school. Recently, Stacey had been feeling more antsy about getting a guy&#39;s interest. That may be because <i>Syntixisaurus</i> breeding season was around the corner. Stacey wasn&#39;t planning getting pregnant herself, but she wondered if Heather and Tyra were this time. If nothing else, she wanted a little companionship. Dating pools can be pretty narrow when you&#39;re a literal dinosaur.<br />
<br />
Stacey paced around a bit nervously as she waited for her turn. Should she have worn a better dress? Maybe she should have tried putting on some makeup. Would that make her look ridiculous? Would jewelry be out of place? Just how many guys would be interested in a single female <i>Syntixisaurus</i>?<br />
<br />
She was snapped out of her worrying when a voice said, &quot;You&#39;re going to wear a track in the floor like that.&quot; Stacey paused and looked around. There was a pterosaur woman in the room looking at her. And Stacey wondered how she hadn&#39;t noticed her before. She was huge, well, not as big as the sauropods, but she was way taller than the other pterosaurs she had seen before. She was also wearing a resplendent dress of red and green.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, just a little pent-up,&quot; said Stacey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Been too long since you last had a boyfriend?&quot; asked the pterosaur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...not really had one before,&quot; said Stacey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I see,&quot; said the pterosaur, &quot;I&#39;m Quetzal, by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stacey,&quot; said Stacey before recalling something, &quot;Wait, aren&#39;t you the <i>Quetzalcoatlus</i>?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious?&quot; asked Quetzal dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I mean, aren&#39;t you supposed to be training for that flight around the world?&quot; asked Stacey.<br />
<br />
&quot;In this weather?&quot; asked Quetzal pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, good point,&quot; said Stacey, &quot;So you&#39;re setting yourself up for a date?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s going to get a bit lonely on that long flight, even if that albatross is good company,&quot; said Quetzal, &quot;I would feel more motivated to keep flying if I knew there was someone waiting for me to come back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds nice,&quot; said Stacey.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re worried no one will be interested?&quot; asked Quetzal.<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you say that?&quot; asked Stacey.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in the business of...adult companionship. I know what the new girls look like when they&#39;re nervous,&quot; said Quetzal.<br />
<br />
Stacey sighed and said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m a bit younger than I look. So I don&#39;t know what to expect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, you don&#39;t have to meet Mr. Right today,&quot; said Quetzal, &quot;You have plenty of time left. And I&#39;m sure there are a lot of guys who would find a woman like you very sexy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; asked Stacey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try looking online for how many people put up furry art about dinosaur women,&quot; said Quetzal, &quot;At least we&#39;re more realistically proportioned. Breast size non-withstanding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacey chuckled at that. Oddly enough, it wasn&#39;t the tail or the claws that took the most getting used to. It was the large breasts that were standard with Animalian women and Dinotopians were no exception. &quot;Thanks for that,&quot; said Stacey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, a senorita like you will have no trouble getting a date,&quot; said Quetzal.</p>
