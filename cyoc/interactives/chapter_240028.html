<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two boys Simon and Ed were looking at the screen inside the computer room as it displayed three additional pop-ups with warnings for the profile [Heather]. Chronivac alerted that she was in danger. Turning her even younger would cause world changing and catastrophic events as norms and laws would have to be changed in order to continue.<br />
<br />
“Wasn’t Heather our babysitter? Weren’t we changing our mother just minute ago?” Simon confirmed from his brother.<br />
<br />
“I believe so. I think our memories were changed.” Ed pulled his computer chair forward.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to make us aware of the changes. Things might get out of hand.” Simon said as he switched his own awareness on.<br />
<br />
“Leave me as is. Give me a memory or a small note that what every thing you say is real even if outside forces would convince me otherwise.” Ed begged from his brother.<br />
<br />
“Okay. That’s your own choice. I wonder if the chronivac allows that.” Simon said and looked for such options. “And there. I changed it. You should have a six sense. I think.”<br />
<br />
Ed thanked his brother and both of them looked at each other for a long time. Simon closed every pop-up on the screen and made [Heather] younger. Then Simon pressed enter.<br />
<br />
17… 16…<br />
<br />
The computer started to make massive changes into the world around the globe. Every written law was changed to make sure that John and Heather could have sex legally. Then the peoples attitude was next on the list. No one knew what was happening as entire nations and their thinking was changed in massive scale. An invisible shock wave of change was affecting everyone and everything. Laws, societal norms, philosophies, papers, men, women and every living weren’t spared. Everybody now believed that 16-year-old was a legal adult. Everything that eighteen years represented meant nothing. It became an odd number in the list of numbers. Holding similar power as someone claimed to be twenty year old. <br />
<br />
People begun to change. Mothers who gave birth at age eighteen were now giving birth two years younger. Assortment of people begun to age rapidly as their live choices depended on the legal age of consent. Only those who cared about number were spared from the changes as to them the number eighteen meant nothing. There were now more younger people behind the wheels. The sweet sixteen got a different meaning as it was considered normal for fourteen year olds to get their first car. People called it fantastic fourteen when you got your first car. Advertisement and movies displaying young adult actors were now changed to 16-year-old teens. <br />
<br />
High schools became a hot pot of controversies as most of the students were legal adults while minority of them were still protected by laws. Legal 16-year-old adults sought out for two year younger partners. In some cases the 16-year-old adults started to date their teachers. It wasn&#39;t unheard-of to see scandals where high school&#39;s public bathrooms were used for reproductive purposes and world of mouth stories of being born inside the high school building was a normal story for many. Some schools were build this in mind and had decicated external buildings for early parenthood. Parking lots had more cars filling it’s space as it was considered normal for people to drive themselves to high school. Only middle schoolers used busses. People were more prone to car accidents as there had to be car made for fourteen year olds that were designed for high school driving. Things were quickly escalating as more similar minor events were rippling and changed the fabric of normal society.<br />
<br />
A 16-year-old high-school student working behind a fast food counter and going to school at the same time was considered normal and expected. Some only studied but it was seen as rich privilege to only study. Houses were build different as new adults needed more spaces to live with their 32-year-old parents. The student&#39;s high school popularity was added to the work curriculum vitae also known as CV. Being popular at high school was beneficial to advancement at work force. Many people saw high school popularity as important as prior education. This meant that if you were popular in high school you could easily have steady job in the future. High schools became a brutal places were everyone tried to keep their apperances high with lots of sacrifice. They wanted to have straight &#39;As&#39; in their popularity scores and bullying became normal place in high schools to push others lower. If you were bullied it meant your life was practically ruined. You might as well give up on your life goals if you weren&#39;t a rival bully yourself. There was no room for sympathy or empathy in this new popularity driven world. The world&#39;s people became bunch of dogs that ate other dogs. Ruthlessness got what you wanted and nobody got punished for it. It was a mantra for many that if someone fooled you it was the victims fault. They should have known better not to be fooled. These same rules, laws and norms affected Heather.<br />
<br />
Heather’s brain chemistry was also changed to adjust to these new world beliefs. She was just having regular normal sex with a guy who was way beyond Heather’s league and considered him as an old man. In Heather&#39;s freshman year she was bullied so hard that she had to quit school. Tears didn&#39;t make her life better so she had do what ever work she was presented with. She was a bum living on wellfare like many other bullied people. On the kitchen table John had directly asked Heather if she wanted to come to take care his cock to which Heather had said yes. The young Heather saw nothing wrong for her to say no to John. It was Heather&#39;s first time doing it and she was going to be paid a hefty sum of money for it. A double win-win situation in her books.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the computer room Simon felt something happening with his body. He was growing older. Ed was also getting significantly older as he had no idea what was happening to him.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on!?” Simon shouted as he felt his legs getting longer.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Ed replied back as he looked like a 17-year-old teen.<br />
<br />
“We are getting older.” Simon told to his brother as the chair under him got smaller.<br />
<br />
“We are!?” Ed looked around himself and didn’t know what to think. “How old?”<br />
<br />
“You were seven and I was eight. Now we both look like twenty year olds.” Simon replied back.<br />
<br />
“Seven? That can’t be right. Our mom had us when she was sixteen.” Ed replied back as his growth stopped at his mid twenties.<br />
<br />
“You look like an old man.” Simon looked in awe as his brother looked like his dad.<br />
<br />
“That’s because I am.” Ed laughed. “That reminds me. Are we going to make more changes to Heather or are done here? Dad asked us to join the foursome action as soon as we are done here. I don’t want them finish too early and be the one who is left with sloppy seconds.”<br />
<br />
Simon turned his head and saw that Heather’s babysitter profession had changed into something else.<br />
<br />
“No way.” Simon looked at the monitor in front of him. “Our babysitter changed into our father’s whore.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Ed asked from his brother behind the compute chair. <br />
<br />
“Our Babysitter? Heather!? No way dude. Look how old we are. Also we just met her today and of course she’s a whore. She&#39;s a high school dropout. Remember how our father asked that we should join him soon. He might be done with her so I’m going to join him. I’m calling dips for her mouth as I know our father always takes the pussy and ass. That leaves you with the whore’s hand as always. Unless you want to fuck her brains out through ear. Ha ha.” Ed laughed and exited the room leaving Simon alone to stare at the computer screen.<br />
<br />
Ed arrived just in time to start spitroasting Heather with his father John as both of them were starting to fill Heather from both ends. Simon noticed the pop-ups filling the chronivacs screen telling to him that if he decided to continue his path the world’s natural order would have to be changed. Simon looked at the computer and after some thinking made his decision.</p>
