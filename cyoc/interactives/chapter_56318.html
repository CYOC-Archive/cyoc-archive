<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The teenage leoman was a elder sibling of one of the boys that Trevor had called a day <br />
before announcing his 'return from the dead.'  The boy had in turn transformed his <br />
parents, and his siblings who as a healthy family loved each other. <br />
<br />
The siblings had gone to public school as the pride did opposed to the pack that home <br />
schooled it's pups. The parents had gone to work as if nothing had changed, and as far as <br />
reality was concerned, nothing had. <br />
<br />
Felmans and dragons also preferred public education, not having the numbers for a mass <br />
education system of their own. As for Gargoyles, while hardly stupid, their size and a <br />
nature made education the responsibility of the previous gargoyles nearly by default, and <br />
hadn't changed in two thousand years. <br />
<br />
The leoman at work would hardly transform all their coworkers, hardly any of them, but <br />
the ones who they saw, and who saw them, as genuine friends who bound went far beyond <br />
where their paycheck came from, the cascade effect would continue to spread.  <br />
<br />
The siblings at school transformed their dearest friends and high school sweethearts, who <br />
had gone on that afternoon to transform their families as well. Some of whom were <br />
transformed in the middle of a heated argument -the love being there beneath the <br />
surface- the arguments quickly dying out the moment the changes were complete. And <br />
their siblings would change, who would then change their friends, and so the cycle would <br />
continue apparently ad infinitum. <br />
<br />
And the number of leoman within Glendale continued to rise.  And as the light shinned <br />
brighter, the shadows became ever more dark by contrast. <br />
<br />
The teenage male leoman calmly walked down the street. He politely ignored the looks a <br />
few teenage and middle aged human woman gave his 'package', knowing they were furries <br />
at heart, people who insisted they were another species on the inside and desperately <br />
scoured Glendale for a turn at the game to transform themselves (not thinking how they'd <br />
be totally at the Asker's -likely a total stranger- mercy), 'Can't they accept they're beautiful <br />
and unique already the way they are?' The teenage leoman thought to himself. <br />
<br />
He was so distracted by his own daily introspection however that he bumped right into <br />
someone, who was nearly knocked off their feet. <br />
<br />
The teenage leoman immediately stopped and looked down to help who had stumbled <br />
into.<br />
<br />
The human teenager's outfit looked like a cliche gang member outfit from a video game, <br />
orange vest with garish symbol on the back, equally garish tattoos, leather pants with <br />
chains, and Nikes painted black. <br />
<br />
The punk looked as if he had permanent hemorrhoids and kidney stones. His expression <br />
was mean enough to scare a bear.  He was short, had an amazingly thin neck, his jaw was <br />
huge in comparison, and had his black hair in a mohawk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I'm sorry!&quot; The teenage leoman said. <br />
<br />
<br />
Bobby's mother had been Cursed to be a nudist (weather she liked it or not), she had in <br />
turn cursed her son to always remember his homework, and Bobby had given Bart and <br />
Jenny a harmless Dare on the promise of making him a lupman afterwards, and had then <br />
left the boy with nothing as they went on to fulfill their scheme (and a harsh talking to by <br />
his mother of using the game so recklessly and acknowledging herself that she hadn't <br />
thought how her son would in turn use the game). <br />
<br />
The double standard between Human, Felman, and Dragon nudity, and that of Gargoyle, <br />
Lupman, and Leoman was simply one of those double-standards that always existed in <br />
civilization in one form or another that enabled culture to function.  Dragons, being <br />
walking furnaces, wore what they did to dissipate body heat. <br />
<br />
Bobby's mother  however was questioning it now. Bobby's mother had done her best to <br />
work at home, clothes teleporting off her the milisecond it was on her (she was scared to <br />
think what she'd do when winter came). And have her grocery's delivered. But then came <br />
the day that was her elderly grandmother's birthday, and the store she had ordered the <br />
ingredients from was out. <br />
<br />
After exhausting her option, she had no choice but to go down to the market. Of course <br />
she got stared, of course she did her best to avoid being spotted by the police least she be <br />
arrested for public exposure. <br />
<br />
She made a pathetic attempt to 'sneak' into the market, get what she needed, and run like <br />
Hades back to her home. <br />
<br />
The punk knew none of this, he just saw a naked woman who didn't look all that bad and <br />
who was the right species. In typical teenage logic he didn't even look at her face to see the <br />
worry and humiliation and instead only look at her torso. <br />
<br />
He had blocked her path, he touched her. She slapped him. He punched back. She <br />
screamed. Nobody either came to her aid or seem to notice. <br />
<br />
Except for one old man who moved with a limp with gloved hands (if one looked closely <br />
one saw flippers instead of hands and feet).  The punk proved to be stronger than he <br />
looked and took the woman's counter attacks, after all, this woman clearly wanted this, or <br />
she wouldn't be not dressed like this. <br />
<br />
The old man said, &quot;Erad ro morfnart?&quot;<br />
<br />
The punk ignored the crazy old cook.  Then the old man took out the tape recorder and <br />
replayed his own voice backwards, &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
The punk still ignored him only distracted for a second. But Bobby's mother took that <br />
chance to knee the punk between the legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mih ot od em ekil uoy dluow tahw, htob steg eh?&quot;  The old man said and then played the <br />
tape backward again. <br />
<br />
&quot;He gets both, what would you like me to do to him?&quot; <br />
<br />
The face of Bobby's mother darkened. <br />
<br />
In the present the punk looked up at the leoman. <br />
<br />
Of course the teenager leoman in spite of being a year younger was easily a head taller <br />
than the squat human teen in front of him.<br />
<br />
That huge lionhood, the well meaning and genuine smile, the genetic disposition to <br />
working for the Man, taller, stronger, more popular with the girls... in short, everything the <br />
punk hated. <br />
<br />
&quot;TRANSFORM OR DARE?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;T-transform?!&quot; The leoman teen gasped out in shock and surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang! Was hoping you'd take too long and get both and dare you to dare me to laugh at <br />
you! Oh well!&quot; The punk grinned. The aura of protective fate that prevent an exchange of <br />
the game from being interrupted or interfered with was in full effect. The punk spoke with <br />
fake sweetness,   &quot;You're gonna Transform into a lovely lovin' lady lioness love doll! Best <br />
quality! Never needin' repairs! And you're gonna love every moment of it! It's all yer gonna <br />
think about! And you're gonna be for just me, me me me!&quot; <br />
<br />
A loophole allowed the Punk's game to go through, the nature of the 'plague' only <br />
protected the leoman's species from being changed, nothing more. <br />
<br />
No longer feeling threatened, the punk simply went on and on in his rant, desperately <br />
needing more than one kind of outlet, the leoman teen of course having no clue whathe <br />
was talking about, &quot;That beotch cursed me so I can't never get a thrill while touching or <br />
interacting with the flesh or breath or fur or hair of another person. No nothing! She cursed <br />
it so I could only get a thrill from -things!- She made  me a freak! And then she kicked me <br />
again in the knees just so I'd be in too much pain to throw the game back in her back!&quot; <br />
<br />
Few people if ever, actually tried to do the 'I dare you never to use the game' and these <br />
never worked, the game would not allow itself to die, or be trapped, and people who died <br />
with turns meant that turn only floated about until it found someone with a level of spite <br />
that reminded it of the three witches who had dared the leader of the hunters to kill her <br />
best friend. <br />
<br />
The leoman teen took a step back, he didn't get far. He fell over backwards.  His body <br />
stiffened first of course. His skin became a super-smooth material, as his fur fused with <br />
his skin becoming the tan color his fur had been. <br />
<br />
His beautiful mane pulled back into his body, as like part of a balloon at the same time <br />
breasts larger than any leoman would actually have ballooned out of his best. His fanged <br />
vanished. His internal organs turned to air. His joints became adjustable as his body moved <br />
on it's own into a neutral eagle pose. His ears became just pieces of material, his eyes <br />
became painted, just like his noise, but his sense somehow remained. <br />
<br />
Then his lionhood pulled into itself and inverted, while his rear and mouth  became <br />
shallower, and in a matter of moments were all completely identical. His fingers and toes <br />
fused together and his claws vanished too. His tail became a ropy thing with a tuff of fake <br />
fur on the end.  A huge open mouth smile formed on the doll's face as it gently rocked <br />
back and forth on the side walk. <br />
<br />
In his mind he thought, 'NO! I'm a leoman! My name is Leon! I'm a person! I love my family! <br />
I'm a leoman! My name is Leonana! I'm a person! I love my boyfriend! YES! I don't need a <br />
name. I'm an leoman-love-doll. I love my owner! I love him so so much! I hope he uses me <br />
soon! I love him soon!' <br />
<br />
&quot;Mine, all mine.&quot; Said the punk. He took the leoman love doll that had been a person a <br />
second ago and no one tried to stop him. The punk made his way back to the rundown <br />
apartment he called home and undoing the dozen locks came inside and laid the love doll <br />
on the bed.  Undressing himself at once he plunged himself into his new prize. Filling her <br />
with bliss at being used by her master who she loved, the only thing she loved.<br />
<br />
The punk went on with this for hours, the only outlet he had for his lusts, the only place he <br />
could have release the only place he found his pleasure. Caressing and hugging the doll, in <br />
the depth of his depraved and empty soul, in his twisted and warped mind, he muttered <br />
out, &quot;I love you babe.&quot; And somewhere in there, a tiny, tinny spark of affection, a <br />
microscopic amount...  The punk was already naked, and didn't notice the tail starting to <br />
grow out of his rear. <br />
<br />

<br />
With their loved ones currently boarded up, no one questioned the two quadruplets staying <br />
at Big Bad Estate in the mean time.  Just as the Betas didn't question where their daughters <br />
were when they didn't show up for dinner. And no one questions where one of the Omegas <br />
was, let alone Lawrence or one of the former gallery wolves who turned out to be his aunt.  <br />
<br />
Just as no one questioned where the gold and silver she wolf statues with clocks in their <br />
bellies  next to the thinker Kira statue had appeared mere minutes after Luna and Sunny's <br />
shift ended for the day/night. <br />
<br />
Umeko of course had her bags packed for relocating to the house that Penny would be <br />
staying with her family. <br />
<br />
Dinner was a solemn event. After so much chaos, damage, and confusion and revelation. It <br />
was all anyone could do was to hold onto their sanity as they ate and hope things fixed <br />
themselves in the end. <br />
<br />

<br />
Lark. Jimmy. Rosalie. Rouge with curls. Canary (yellow hair cut short save for a bang that <br />
fell over one eye). Oceana (orange hair that was shoulder length).  Becky (blue hair that fell <br />
straight to her naked rear). Oliver (green hair with curls). Violet done in a long braid that <br />
weld around her body almost. Irine (Indigo hair that done up in a series of braids in a more <br />
sane imitation of Gomorrah's illogical mess of hair braids). <br />
<br />
With their loyal leoman bodyguards, these children, some naked, some in fancy clothes, <br />
some in simple cloth tunic, moved in a spiral pattern away from the witches house, leaving <br />
flowers the color of their hair or rainbow swirls in their wake. And Glendale bloomed, <br />
ruining crops and destroying roads.<br />
<br />
Having relocated Kathrine, Vatican, and Draco, and carving some bones into deadly tools of <br />
the sight of some of her two fellow church companions Marie finally had some time for idle <br />
thoughts. As she looked at the tragic sight of her loyal protector, she worried how they'd <br />
find a female gargoyle to transfer his spirit in the new world. This made Marie think, <br />
<br />
'Why do male Gargoyles exist? What purpose do they serve?' Marie had not thought much <br />
about the private lives of gargoyles, what purpose did the males serve? What was their <br />
purpose? <br />
<br />
Marie didn't know the first thing about evolution, but she did believe everything existed for <br />
a purpose. So she wondered. What was the purpose of the male gargoyle? <br />
<br />
Then she turned her attention on Linus who was standing guard with his trusty, very well <br />
maintained and carefully loaded and managed musket. <br />
<br />
'How much can I actually trust him?' Marie Cruz thought of the fifth member of her team. <br />
'He readily agreed to be on our side a lot faster than any person with common sense <br />
should have. He knew a lot more than he should have. He figured things out a lot faster <br />
than anyone should have, and practically jumped to conclusion that all happened to be <br />
perfectly right... There is a lot more to Linus than meets the eye... and I need to know what <br />
before the finale... heh, I guess you and I are alike that way Draco...'<br />
<br />
That was when Marie's sixth sense blared with an alarm bell. Marie had felt it getting <br />
stronger since they had begun to rest up, like there was more of something for it to use... <br />
whatever the case, Marie felt 'Death' coming closer to them, for that was the mark what <br />
was coming carried, death for her and her friends. <br />
<br />
Marie looked at her broken and pathetic teammates, and gestures for Linus to follow her, <br />
side by side. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
As Marie and Linus walked back into the camp that was being used as a recovery site, <br />
Kathrine of course looked up at her best friend.   Linus resisted the urge to shudder. <br />
<br />
Linus had never seen a felman injured like this before, but he did his best not to stare. It <br />
did not cease to amaze him how different felman looked without their fur.  They didn't look <br />
human, even less so. Then again, half of Kathrine's fur HAD been -burned- away. Weather <br />
she'd grow fur on that side of her body again was anyone's guess. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marie? What happened out there? What was that noise?&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie shook her head and smiled, &quot;It was nothing Kathrine, don't worry about it.&quot; Marie <br />
Cruz silently added bearing false witness to one of her many, many sins.<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza pointed at chair looking to be designed by Pablo Picasso, &quot;Lilly and Casandra, <br />
would you please look over there, and not hear a single thing we saw until we touch you <br />
on the shoulders. And you won't ask what part of the story you missed.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; The twins said together in an entranced tone and moved like dolls looking straight <br />
at the chair smiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do-?!&quot; Maddex's heads snarled clearly upset by this. The twins didn't react <br />
to their father's outburst at all and kept on smiling and staring at the chair. <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza wasn't phased, &quot;You don't want them to hear this next part, and if we hide a <br />
part of the story from them they'd only try their hardest to fine out what it was they <br />
missed... <br />
<br />
Maddex was quickly mollified, remembering what he had said before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe then, if that is the case with Cansandra and Lilly, then perhaps, I, and my cousins <br />
Abbey and Samantha should not hear this part as well.&quot; Alice said. Alice wasn't sure if she <br />
counted as innocent, and Samantha likely counted even less after her time as glass, but <br />
Abbey had always been the most ideal of the three glass pups. <br />
<br />
&quot;If that is your wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is.&quot; Alice said. Abbey also nodded. Samantha however said, &quot;I'll listen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey looked at her. Another divergence that made them not the identical <br />
triplets that their mothers were, another division in the sense of unity they tried to share <br />
like their mothers had. <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza ended the conflict, &quot;Alice, Abbey, please look that way and don't hear what we <br />
saw until we touch you on the shoulder and you won't ask what part of the story you <br />
missed.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well as you wish.&quot; Alice nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whao kay.&quot; Abbey replied. <br />
<br />
The two moved their heads doll like and simply looked at the same chair smiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;An orange haired girl named Meranda. And a leoman named Frank. Frank was good with <br />
the two leoman cubs in the Witch's Pride as was it's nickname. Meranda was prone to <br />
making silly noises at random times, something that most found amusing. She was curious <br />
as a cat and as intrusive in personal space as a dog. Of course for the witch's commune, <br />
this was all considered perfectly acceptable behavior. <br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
1689 <br />
<br />
&quot;You two are our righteous avengers!&quot; The three witches told the two. Meranda wearing a <br />
dark magenta dress with few ruffles. The two stood perfectly side by side at attempt <br />
looking at the witches like they were their entire world. <br />
<br />
The three witches continued in unison, a symbol of their unifying anger. Lilith and Herodias <br />
lay nearby cheering their masters on. <br />
<br />
&quot;They have grave robbed our grandmother! They have threatened our new world of <br />
freedom and equality! They were spared but now they die! Together the two of you will <br />
annihilate them!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two smiled and nodded. Meranda took Frank's paw and they turned around and happily <br />
walked out of the cabin ignoring the children at play and the leoman at work and the <br />
mundane cats at their feet. <br />
<br />
the interspecieness of sight caused many a puritan to glare, but no one said anything, no <br />
one dared say anything, somewhere in their subconscious knowing not to challenge this. <br />
<br />
The two smiling and holding hands, soon were almost skipping along. They pass through <br />
Glendale and it's ever growing stranger plant life and through the protective ring of tree <br />
guardians that now circled the town except for the roads going in and out but parted for <br />
them. <br />
<br />
The two went precisely as the crow flies where Joella had seen the grave robber and her <br />
friends. <br />
<br />
But before getting there, they found the grave robber and one of her friends, the middle <br />
aged man with the musket. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Meranda said, &quot;You and your friends have been very very naughty. And you need to <br />
be punished like naughty people need to be. Do you want to be statues, fairies, gold deer, <br />
or mud?&quot; <br />
<br />
The middle age man fired. The bullet bounced off an invisible wall and went in the exact <br />
direction it came from, and went into the barrel of the musket, damaging it, (it would take <br />
time to repair). <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you wanna be mud then.&quot; Meranda said as her eyes glowed commanding the <br />
bones in the grave robber and middle aged man to turn to goo. <br />
<br />
The grave robber threw some knives... they cut a tree branch above them, it hit the two <br />
hard, and then it was on fire. Frank shielded Meranda. Who turned her eyes towards the <br />
grave robber. &quot;MUD! MUD! MUD!&quot; <br />
<br />
 The last thing Meranda saw alive was another white throwing knife headed straight at her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Meranda's parents were told-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait wait wait! You mean Meranda's foster parents right? Because Meranda was one of the <br />
former raiders right? Right?&quot; Betty said with an unsure and scared look on her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.... Meranda was one of the girls who had taken the candy, and was taken from her <br />
parents to be put under the direct care of the witches... her parents were told that she had <br />
been mauled by a bear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Betty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would it really have made you feel better if -another- innocent child had died instead of <br />
that innocent child?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no it wouldn't it's just, if she had been one of the former raiders, then no one would <br />
have grieved her outside of her circle of friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Eliza looked incredulous, &quot;And that's supposed to have made it BETTER-?! No one to <br />
grieve her-?! No one to say goodbye?! At least Meranda's parents gave her a proper <br />
funeral!&quot; <br />
<br />
Betty was shocked and belittled by Marie-Eliza's reaction. But said, &quot;No.... no it wouldn't be <br />
better.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lawrence and Meddex's heads looked at each other, realizing they had been thinking the <br />
same thing as Betty. <br />
<br />
Samantha stayed silent hearing at the loss of life.  Maddex touched the shoulders of his <br />
two daughters while Samantha touched the shoulders of Alice and Abbey. They continued <br />
listening to the story without a peep of curiosity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marie Cruz of course wanted to do the second battle with the witches alone, not wanting <br />
to see any more of her teammates hurt and wanting to save on time. Thankfully they were <br />
able to convince her this was suicide and convinced her to wait until the others could join <br />
her in battle months later in the early fall.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Still alive I see.&quot;  Marie knew that voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am Goldwyn.&quot; She replied, she wasn't surprised when she found herself in an open <br />
open field this time. <br />
<br />
On Marie's side was a Ancient Dragon sized black crow in a raven's mask nesting, along <br />
with mutt as a puppy chasing his own tail.<br />
<br />
The field was covered in tall green grass. <br />
<br />
There were several classic paintings floating in midair, one had Kathrine as the 'Birth of <br />
Venus', other paintings showed Zoey, Marie's teammates, all as the character of interest in <br />
various other masterworks. <br />
<br />
Of course there would be a giant glowing cross. <br />
<br />
On the other side was series of black twisted thorn covered in rainbow colored flowers and <br />
statues of two middle aged people, and four elderly people, and one crow or raven. <br />
<br />
There was also some fairy statues but they were smashed. There also a statue of Marie as a <br />
child, also smashed. Of course there was Herodias and Lilith among the thorns and brightly <br />
colored flowers. <br />
<br />
Finally a solid gold statue of the girl who had warned Marie and the other to proceed no <br />
further in their quest, her statue had to be about three times or more to scale. <br />
<br />
What divided the two sides wasn't a river anymore, but a graveyard. On the tomb stones <br />
were names of people Marie Cruz had killed in her line of duty, and the names on the <br />
tomb stones were of people the witches had remade into something not themselves. <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is not Goldwyn! It is Gogatha, Dog of God.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... You'll always be Goldwyn to me, Bride of Satan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You call me a bride of Satan, yet I've spent my life liberating people and bringing them <br />
happiness! And you? You've spent your life killing anyone who doesn't agree with your <br />
point of view!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And you're saying you're better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! I and my sisters don't kill people! We liberate them! We make them into <br />
something that's free of the cursed world of adults!&quot; The adult woman said old enough to <br />
be Joella's mother.  <br />
<br />
&quot;And you think that's somehow NOT killing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We remake them! We reuse them! The number of lives remains constant!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You end one life to bring another life into the world? That's necromancy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are IGNORANT! You just eat up whatever is fed you! And you didn't need to be this <br />
way! You have the gift inside you! You could have been one of us! We could have had the <br />
world ALREADY FREE by now! Everyone who is unhappy and in pain at this moment in time <br />
is YOUR FAULT!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie took a step back, and breathed in deep, and replied, &quot;I am a killer. I have been since <br />
the night I lost this eye. I could make no claims to being a child after that night. I've killed <br />
children who are completely of no choice over what they are or what they are doing. And I <br />
haven't been able to improve in that regard one bit, my solution when it was them or me <br />
was still to save my own sinful hide. ... I won't be arrogant enough to claim I am a needed <br />
evil. But you are an evil that needs to be stopped!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You call a totally free world evil?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where one's own choices are completely meaningless for there is no way to predict what'll <br />
happen next so therefore it is no different from gambling with no way to tell the outcome <br />
of one choice from another? To make free will completely pointless? By making everyone <br />
think what you want them to think Goldwyn?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be kind and peaceful! And little girls wouldn't have to say goodbye to their <br />
friends because they were pretending to be a boy and suddenly had to grow up and <br />
couldn't be that anymore! And no one would have to say goodbye to their parents ever <br />
again!&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie fell silent and looked at her feet, her body limb. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Lord said that the last enemy to be defeated would be death... &quot;<br />
<br />
Golgatha grinned. <br />
<br />
&quot;BUT YOU ARE NOT GOD GOLDWYN! To enforce the law is DIFFERENT from passing <br />
JUDGEMENT on the VALUE of a person! You have no right to decide what a 'perfect world' <br />
would be! Let alone a free one!&quot; <br />
<br />
Golgtha was flabbergasted. <br />
<br />
&quot;GET OUT OF MY DREAMS!&quot; <br />
<br />
A wall appeared between the two. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
When Marie awoke, she beheld her teammates, Vatican, Kathrine, her family. Kathrine and <br />
Draco were asleep. Vatican didn't sleep. And Linus was sleeping with one eye open. That <br />
made Marie shudder. Her sixth sense may have told her she'd meet a fifth teammate in the <br />
new world, it didn't say she could trust him. All the same, &quot;I promise,&quot; She said lowly, &quot;None <br />
of you will suffer from my mistakes again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie leaned back and looked at the stars in the sky. 'Recovery is going to be a long and <br />
hard road.'</p>
