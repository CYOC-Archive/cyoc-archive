<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Note: perspective change to second person, from the dog. Note #2: the dog breed wasn&#39;t included so I&#39;m just going to say husky.)<br />
<br />
You frantically ran through the gym, and then into a nearby pet accessory store that was small. You then tried calming yourself down seeing that nothing had much happened overall, and then looked up to see a human woman staring at you. The woman leaned down and examined the medallion closely, and you just sat there puzzled, but allowed the human to do so. &quot;Wow, that thing is really wrapped around you huh? Dang can&#39;t get it off either....here let me put this on you real quick.&quot; The human woman said putting a collar on around your neck, right above the medallion.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the medallion began glowing, and disappeared from your body, and then your body began changing. Your spine grew longer, and motioned into a more anthro position. Your hind paws mostly remained the same, but your hind legs changed to become more anthropomorphic. Then your arms changed becoming longer, and human-like in shape as you began struggling to stand. Then your forepaws changed your fingered paws becoming more separated, and you grew opposable thumbs that were movable in addition to your normal fingers/paws. Then you saw your eight breasts expanding, and becoming similar in size to the humans breasts, but you had eight, and they seemed smaller working down your body. You vagina then moved itself in between your legs, and flesh seemed to expand around your ass forming two plump butt cheeks. Finally overall your flesh became more sensitive and softer in multiple areas, but you still kept your canine features like your head, paw shapes, tail, fur, and gender.<br />
<br />
You then felt something click in your mind, and you seemed to have gained human intellect, and knowledge over basic speech. You looked at yourself scared, and afraid, and then to the human who was just as shocked at what happened. You then saw a separate room, and ran inside shutting the door behind you frantically. The room you were in was odd to you, there was a large bowl of water that had a ring around it, a weird metal thing with two nobbs and a bowl, and finally a small box on the wall that had another dog in it who was just like you. You approached the box on the wall, and motioned to touch the being on the other side, but your hand pressed flat, and was unable to connect with her.<br />
<br />
You then were completely confused, but you thought about it using your increased intelligence and still couldn&#39;t figure it out alone. You then broke into tears,&quot;What...&quot; you began realizing you could talk like a human, and knew how to speak their language of sorts as well as understand it. You then broke into tears again and began crying,&quot;Damn it! What am I? What&#39;s happened to me?! How is this me?! Why is this me?! What am I?!&quot; You yelped, and growled crying.<br />
<br />
The human then opened the door and walked up to you slowly, ans silently. You stared at the woman who was staring at you, and eventually reached out to you with her hand and you snapped at her hand. &quot;Go away,&quot; you said against breaking into tears, and the woman spoke,&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I can help you please just let me.&quot; You were shocked when you figured out you could understand the woman as well as yourself, and she seemed to understand you. &quot;H...how?&quot; You asked quivering in fear, traumatized by your transformation. &quot;Look I am don&#39;t know anything about what just happened, and neither do you. You seemed confused, and you currently have nowhere else to go now, so please just let me help however I can possible.&quot; The woman said <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you turn me back?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the woman said, and you whined, but she continued,&quot;But that&#39;s not exactly bad right? I can&#39;t turn you back, but I can help you adapt to this new you. I just want to know a few things about you first.&quot; <br />
<br />
You nodded, and sat down on the floor like you&#39;ve seen humans do and curled your tail in front of you. &quot;Okay first, what were you, before the transformation.&quot; The woman asked. &quot;I don&#39;t know what one would call that, but your kind always called me stuff like stray, dog, bitch, and I basically lived off of what your kind put into those bags.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;So you were what I saw you were as you came into my store, and you lived on the streets of town always wandering without a home.&quot; The woman said <br />
<br />
&quot;I know when I first saw you, I had lived my entire life like that, but I don&#39;t know what exactly you mean by streets, town, and home.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;You really don&#39;t know anything about human life do you?&quot; The woman asked and you nodded,&quot;Nothing, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m even communicating with you right now, but I am.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have a name?&quot; The woman asked<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a name?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that answers that question, but I have one more for you. Would you like to live with me? I will do my best to teach you everything about humanity, and keep you safe. You are going to need a name, and what a name is is something that we use to refer to one another when we talk like this. My name is Krista,  and I can give you a new name easily.&quot; The woman, Krista said <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; you said almost crying again <br />
<br />
&quot;How about, Kate? It seems to fit considering it&#39;s simple, but sweet as a human-like husky like yourself is.&quot; Krista said <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I.......I love it, thank you Krista,&quot; you said hugging Krista tightly and your tail was wagging rapidly.<br />
<br />
Krista then backed off,&quot;I think that was a bit too much of a hug Kate. C&#39;mon I have an apartment upstairs, lucky for you I was planning on closing up anyways.&quot; Krista said <br />
<br />
&quot;Closing up?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s one of many ways humans like me use words to look smart. It means to lock up everything in the shop here, and head upstairs.&quot; Krista said,&quot;Just wait there until I come back, oh and if you need to make body waste make sure it&#39;s in a bowl with the ring like that one, or a toilet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, this is so weird.&quot; You said sitting down on the toilet, and Krista gave you a shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this thing?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s called a shirt, and it goes on like I have mine, here let me help.&quot; Krista said, and you tried your best to cooperate as she put the shirt on you, and it covered most of your breasts, but your lower half was left uncovered. You then noticed that you dropped the collar on the floor that you were wearing before, and picked it up.</p>
