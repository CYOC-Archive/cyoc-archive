<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Frank and Richard were done in the admissions office, they went to the lobby of the main office building.  Richard spoke to Frank near the entrance door.  &quot;Listen, I need to go check on your mother.  Do you want to come with or do you want to stay here for a bit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank thought for a bit and then said, &quot;I think I&#39;ll stay here.  I want to explore campus a bit and check things out.  Plus, I still need to go to the bookstore to pick up my books.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard shrugged and then nodded as he said, &quot;All right, it&#39;ll be a couple of hours before I&#39;ll be back.  I&#39;m going to the hospital and maybe back home to drop your mom off.  Meet me here when you&#39;re ready to go?&quot;  Frank nodded in agreement before Richard left the building as he made his way to the van.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Rose was sitting up in her hospital bed when Dr. Chlorophylls walked in the room.  &quot;So, how is my patient this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing better than yesterday,&quot; Rose replied as she turned to face the doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, good,&quot; Dr. Chlorophylls said as she closed the privacy curtain around Rose&#39;s bed.  &quot;I&#39;m just here to check your injuries and the stitches.  Could you take off your shirt for me please?&quot;  Rose nodded as she stripped off her shirt.  Dr. Chlorophylls examined Rose&#39;s back.  She couldn&#39;t find any bruising on her back where the mountain lion pounced on Rose.  Dr. Chlorophylls took a stethoscope and put one end of it on Rose&#39;s back.  &quot;Could you take a deep breath for me?  Inhale...&quot; She said as Rose did what she said.  The two of them repeated the exercise with Dr. Chlorophylls moving the stethoscope to a different spot on Rose&#39;s back.  After listening, she removed the stethoscope from her ears and asked, &quot;Does it still hurt when you breathe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as much as last night,&quot; Rose responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;That means you&#39;re healing well,&quot; Dr. Chlorophylls said with a bit of a smile. &quot;Just let me make a few more checks,&quot; she continued as she pulled out an ear thermometer and stuck it into Rose&#39;s ear.  After a few moments, it beeped, and Dr. Chlorophylls pulled it out and examined the reading.  &quot;Good, looks like you have a normal temperature,&quot; she commented.  &quot;Now let me see your ankle,&quot; she said as Rose lifted her leg.  Dr. Chlorophylls removed the bandaging that was on Rose&#39;s ankle and examined the stitching.  &quot;Well, looks like that&#39;s holding well,&quot; she said.  &quot;Everything&#39;s looking good.  I think it&#39;ll be safe for you to leave today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s good,&quot; Rose said, &quot;So, nothing&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As far as I can tell, you&#39;re healing fine,&quot; Dr. Chlorophylls.  &quot;Nothing&#39;s broken as far as I can tell, just some bruised ribs.  The stitches are holding, and that gash in your ankle is healing well.  And there&#39;s no infections that I can tell, especially no rabies.  I&#39;m going to prescribe some antibiotics just in case, but I think it&#39;s safe for you to be discharged at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I can leave today?&quot; Rose asked as she put her shirt back on.<br />
<br />
Dr. Chlorophylls shrugged and said, &quot;I don&#39;t see why not.  Although I would suggest taking it easy on your ankle for the next few days, but otherwise, I don&#39;t see anything to be worried about.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door, and the two of them turned to see Richard standing in the doorway.  &quot;How&#39;s she doing?&quot; Richard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, she&#39;s doing fine,&quot; Dr. Chlorophylls said. &quot;I was just saying to Rose that she can be released today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; Richard said with a smile.  &quot;I have Frank down at the college, so if Rose is free, I can take her home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be great,&quot; Rose said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get the paperwork ready and you can fill it out in the lobby,&quot; Dr. Chlorophylls said, &quot;And remember, take it easy on the ankle.  Let it heal for a few days and you should be back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Normal, huh...&quot; Rose said under her breath.  The past few days have been anything but normal.<br />
<br />
Richard heard what Rose said, but said nothing as Dr. Chlorophylls walked out of the room.  Richard helped Rose put her socks and shoes on and he helped her out of the bed.  There was a bit of tenderness as Rose&#39;s foot touched the ground.  &quot;You ok?&quot; Richard asked in which Rose just smiled and nodded.  With Richard&#39;s help, the two of them made their way to the reception area to fill out the paperwork.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
After filling out the paperwork and getting the antibiotic prescription, the two of them made their way to the van.  Richard helped Rose climb in before getting into the driver&#39;s seat.  Richard started the van and the two of them made their way home.  <br />
<br />
During the drive, few words were exchanged, but it gave Rose an opportunity to study her husband.  He was still in his normal form, but it changed much since his entrance into were society as a werelion.  The first thing she noticed that all of the grey in his hair was gone.  There weren&#39;t any wrinkles in his face, and he looked the same as when they dated in college.  Her eyes wondered down his body and noticed that his shirt could barely contain his new body.  His shoulders seemed to be a bit broader, and she could clearly see the muscles on his chest.  His arms bulged with new muscles, and she couldn&#39;t help smile a little as she watched his arms flex with every movement.  Her eyes wondered down his chest towards his stomach, and she noticed his abs.  Moving down to his waist, she noticed that his pants had the same trouble as his shirt, in that it barely fitted him.  Remembering back to when she was with Sheila, she noticed how different Richard&#39;s package looked when he turned into a werelion.  And when they were at the hospital, she could feel something different about Richard&#39;s penis when he tried to climb into bed with her.  A part of her wondered just how different he was now.  She spend the rest of the time staring at Richard&#39;s crotch when he said something that interrupted her thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re home,&quot; he said as he drove the van into the garage. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Rose replied as she shook her head and blinked her eyes.  As far as she could tell, Richard didn&#39;t pick up on her staring.  Richard helped Rose out of the car into the house.  &quot;Could you take me up to the bedroom?&quot; Rose asked to which Richard nodded.  As the two of them made their way through the house, Rose noted how quiet it was with everyone else was gone.  Rose gave a small smile as she thought that this was a good opportunity to satisfy her...curiosity.  The two of them made their way to the master bedroom before Richard helped Rose into their bed.  &quot;Could you stay for a moment?&quot; Rose asked, &quot;And stay close.&quot;  Richard nodded and was standing next to her near the bed.  Rose sat up and her hands rubbed his chest before she started to unbutton his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rose!&quot; Richard exclaimed in surprise, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhh...&quot; she hissed quietly as she put a finger on his lips.  &quot;You&#39;ve changed since last night,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;I want to see...how you&#39;ve changed.&quot;  Her hands continued to unbutton Richard&#39;s shirt, revealing more of his body.  Rose confirmed what she could see under that shirt as he grew quite muscular.  Rose rubbed her hands against his chest, and she could feel his heartbeat as well as the bulge of muscle in his chest.  Her hands moved down his body as she could feel his abs on his stomach before reaching his pants.  She quickly and quietly unbuttoned his pants, letting them slide down his legs followed by his underwear.  Her eyes stared at his package as it looked different from what she knew before.  She examined his balls, and they felt a bit bigger than what she remembered before his transformation to a werelion.  Her hands made her way to his penis, which at that time was only half-erect.  She started to slowly rub his penis, and she could feel it getting bigger, harder, and longer.  Before long, it was fully erect and pointed directly at her.  She took a deep breath as she marveled at the size.  While smaller than his werelion form, it was still bigger than before his transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rose?&quot; Richard asked as he watched his wife start to rub him, &quot;What are you doooooo...&quot; his words were cutoff by the pleasure of his wife starting to rub him.  More than the pleasure, there were new instincts that he hadn&#39;t felt before.  The instinct to mate.  The instinct to make his wife his queen.  The instinct to have sex.  Richard emitted a low growl as the sexual pleasure spread throughout this body.  Rose heard the growl as she looked up.  A small voice in her head wondered if she should continue like this.  A louder voice said she should keep going and join her husband in were society.  This small debate sounded in her head as she continued to service her husband.</p>
