<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were several girls that probably could have fit the bill, but in a world where every transformation is possible, why not pick someone that would be more of a change? &quot;Oliver.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
Oliver was an unlikely friend of Jenny&#39;s. He was a shy anime nerd who would be the last person you&#39;d expect to be friends with a cheerleader if you went by typical high-school stereotypes. In fact, it was true that they tended to run in different circles. <br />
<br />
However, they had one thing in common. Oliver also had a transformation kink. Jenny was able to deduce this by the types of manga he tended to bring to school. They all fell under the genre, Gender Bender. While Oliver was not Trans, he did like the genre. While his interests were more specialized then Jenny&#39;s, she liked all transformations equally, it did give them something to talk about and made Oliver the only person other than Jeff who knew about her fetish.<br />
<br />
Jenny had already seen Oliver earlier so she knew he wasn&#39;t taking advantage of the new world&#39;s transformation options, but that was probably because he was shy and self-conscious. However, as Jenny couldn&#39;t help but turn herself into other things, Oliver wouldn&#39;t be able to resist if given a push.<br />
<br />
Alice thought it over. &quot;Well, he isn&#39;t an obvious choice, but since he&#39;s replacing a member we are loosing, we get access to options like flexibility and muscle memory that aren&#39;t usually available. He&#39;d have to stay a girl for the rest of the season though. You think he&#39;d be fine with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Like Jenny, he liked transformations where the person changing couldn&#39;t turn themselves back. It was why as both a sex doll and a dog, she gave Jeff the power to choose when and if she went back to normal. Having a minimum time requirement before he could go back to being a boy should fulfill that requirement. &quot;I&#39;m sure I can convince him.&quot; She assured Jenny.<br />
<br />
Jenny texted Oliver in her phone to meet her later. She briefly wondered how long she would be able to do that. She was bound to loose her opposable thumbs in a few days. The thought sent her tail into another wagging fit.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day was mostly normal. There were a few classmates who were different races or had hopped the gender fence. Other&#39;s were missing having become objects or pets like Jenny. When asking one of her squad members where he boyfriend was, Sarah revealed that he had gifted himself to her as a vibrator for her birthday. <br />
<br />
Another classmate told her how jealous she was. Her name was Jade, and she was quiet the busty Goth girl. Jade had wanted to follow her idol Sophia into feline-hood, but her boyfriend wouldn&#39;t agree to be her owner. He apparently wanted to have a girlfriend more than a cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we could find him a new girlfriend to replace you with.&quot; Jenny suggested. &quot;Than he can have both.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade smiled. &quot;You know anyone single?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Jenny knew Sarah was now, and Oliver was soon to be female (even though he didn&#39;t know it yet). Then again, maybe Jeff would look good as a girl. Jenny realized she didn&#39;t want her master to be alone and should find him a new mate before she was a total dog. He might be more willing to keep her as a pet if he had someone to occupy his time.<br />
<br />
While Jenny didn&#39;t want to spend her whole life as a dog, or at least hadn&#39;t before the changes started, she loved the idea of being stuck for an unknown amount of time. The thought of waiting for Jeff to break up with someone knew excited her. &quot;I have a few options.&quot; She told Jade. &quot;I&#39;ll ask around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, Jenny got ahold of Oliver at the end of the day. Jeff was with her, holding her leash. &quot;So Oliver, I need a huge favor.&quot; She told him. Jenny knew the stories he liked, so she played to his kink. Oliver liked the stories where the character did choose the change. He liked the ones where it was an accident or the character is tricked or pressured into it. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Oliver asked, eyeing the leash she wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you may notice I&#39;m not going to be I&#39;m shape to be apart of the cheer squad soon.&quot; Jenny grabbed her leash and shook it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I heard. Congratulations by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks! Anyways, regulations say I can pick a replacement who can be altered to replacement with roughly my skill level in cheerleading. I decided to nominate you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....&quot; Oliver&#39;s face turned beet red and his eyes glanced nervously at Jeff. &quot;Why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, most of my friends are already on the squad, and I can&#39;t pick someone they are going to have to replace later.&quot; Jenny explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure...&quot; Oliver began. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please!&quot; Jenny put her hands together and bounced on her feet. &quot;I can&#39;t make another nomination which means the squad will have to train someone new. The captain might try and undo my changes to get me back if they can&#39;t find a replacement. &quot; There it was. The peer pressure the would fulfill the &#39;forced&#39; requirement of his kink.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never been a girl before. What if I don&#39;t like it?&quot; He argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s only for the season at least. You can change back next semester if you want.&quot; Jenny smiled. &quot;You could also stay till the spring, and cosplay as a girl at your next convention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oliver bit his lip. &quot;Fine.&quot; He relented. &quot;I&#39;ll do it. Not sure I&#39;m going to stay changed for the cosplay thing though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I recommend a race change just in case. The squad doesn&#39;t have any Asian girls since Mei became a kitsune at the zoo.&quot; The mythological section of the zoo was something Jenny wanted to check out before her changes were finished.<br />
<br />
Oliver gave a uncertain shrug, but she knew he would love being an Asian cosplayer. Oliver followed Jenny as Jeff guided her to the cheer room. Twice, he had to pull on her leash as she got distracted and tried to run off. She had started to notice interesting smells and wanted to check them out.<br />
<br />
Finally, they joined the rest of the squad, with a representative from Anatomical Alterations were waiting with a strange device. Jenny realized since her own changes had been done by the Chronovac, she hasn&#39;t actually seen how people are transformed in this new reality. <br />
<br />
The squad had been showing him videos that Jenny hadn&#39;t remembered making. Apparently, they were supposed to show the level of flexibility she had along with the move set they wanted Oliver to have in his muscle memory. Normally this was illegal due to cheating in professional sports, but it was allowed for an established team replacing a member. <br />
<br />
Jenny quickly added that Oliver should be an Asian with big boobs. While Oliver tried to argue, the cheer squad quickly drowned him out. It seemed it was popular among the girls of this reality to encourage white guys to become minority women. They also liked the idea of any boy learning the pains of big boobs.<br />
<br />
Once the representative was finished typing on his device, it buzzed and filled a vile with a purple liquid. Removing it, the vile was quickly revealed to be a syringe. &quot;Okay, will the future young lady take a seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oliver took a seat, and given a shot in his arm. He seemed pretty nervous, and reluctant. However, Jenny&#39;s new sense of smell told her he was secretly aroused by this turn of events.<br />
<br />
&quot;Race and gender changes are easier than changing species. So, you will finish changing by Thursday morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you will be ready for the pep rally and the game!&quot; Sarah exclaimed.<br />
<br />
The captain spoke up. &quot;Well, it&#39;s time we start practice so we are all ready.&quot; She stressed all. &quot;And your training starts today Olivia.&quot; She informed him, giving him a new name. &quot;You muscle memory won&#39;t kick in till tomorrow at the earliest but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t start getting ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah showed Jenny, Jeff, and the Anatomical Alterations rep. out. After he left Sarah spoke to Jenny. &quot;I&#39;m gonna miss you on the squad, but I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy.&quot; Sarah gave Jenny a hug and whispered so Jeff wouldn&#39;t hear. &quot;The serum will make Oliver sterile in about half an hour but he will still be able to have sex. You think he would one last hurrah as a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally. &quot; Jenny whispered back. With that she left with a smile on her face. Oliver was going to have yet another fantasy come true. She wished he was aware of the reality changes, so that he would better appreciate the changes.<br />
<br />
Jenny decided to ask Jeff about it later. Thinking of Jeff, she remembered her conversation with Jade. Once Oliver was completely Olivia, maybe she could be his new girlfriend. She would be more likely to stay a girl if a new found interest in boys gave her a reason to. Then again Sarah seemed willing and fun. Suddenly another idea popped up. Katie was single. Her master should have a smart mate shouldn&#39;t he? Olivia or Sarah could go with Jade&#39;s future owner.<br />
<br />
So many options, she would have to put things into motion tomorrow before she was too much of a dog to play matchmaker.</p>
