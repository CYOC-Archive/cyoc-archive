<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley looked over all of the sections and said,&quot;I think I’m going to try the Bee program, more specifically the Queen Bee program. I know I’ll be female, but my uncle works at an apiary and his hives honestly aren’t doing so hot so I’d like to help, plus I’m curious about beekeeping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, I will warn you that this is quite experimental. Subjects we’ve seen have been seen like... building hives but human sized although they would still lay eggs and larvae all the same, except a whole lot of them, so no really big human sized bees except for you, and from what we are told the large hives built are just for personal use from those who have attended this program.&quot; The doctor replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... is there anything special I need to do?&quot; Riley asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can give me your uncle’s address and phone number I’m sure there can be arrangements made to take you out there while you’re getting used to your new body. It’s a rapid and a massive change, so I’m going to put you into anesthesia for a few hours. You’ll wake up feeling hungover after a few hours of sleep, but just stay calm and let us guide you to the transportation vehicle.&quot; The doctor added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any tips for what I should do once I’m there on the apiary?&quot; Riley asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Many say they like building nests in small warm places, do if there’s an old shack with a heater then you’ll love it, especially if it’s humid. As far as everything else... follow your instincts most say,&quot; The doctor said,&quot;Now do you have an idea for a name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about just.... Rebecca? Okay?&quot; Riley replied and the doctor nodded and handed him a pen and a clipboard and said,&quot;Sign your current name on the dotted line, and your new name beneath that one then, please?&quot; Riley did just that and sighed as the doctor pulled out a couple of syringes, and soon Riley was put into anesthesia, and passed out unconscious, looking at the clock on the wall reading 10:23am before he went under.<br />
<br />
Riley, or Rebecca woke up groaning seeing the light of the room and the doctor next to her as well as... his uncle. Rebecca looked down at her body and saw the black and yellow pattern on her body, the exoskeleton on her body, four arms in total with 3 weird insect-like fingers on the ends of each, her legs and feet were just like her hands butane least looked like feet, then she saw two fuzzy breasts with yellow nipples, and a plump pussy between her legs. Sitting up slowly Rebecca saw the time was now 2:12pm and you were in a different room, and the doctor was right Rebecca felt like shit. As you sat up you then noticed the abdomen that was sticking out the base of your ass, which extended out into a barbed stinger and a third slit just above that which you probably felt was the way you laid eggs. Your body was covered in fuzz from your neck to your belly, you were certainly a honeybee alright.<br />
<br />
As Rebecca sat up the doctor and her uncle helped her into a sitting position on the side of the bed she was in, she turned towards a mirror and paused. Rebecca’s head looked like a bee’s head, except instead of the big black intimidating eyes she had pupils with coronas that actually made her look a lot less threatening. Her mouth however was a set of mandibles that were great for eating fruits and anything that had a nice sweetness to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there girl... how are you doing?&quot; Rebecca’s uncle, Jacob asked and Rebecca looked down at her body and said,&quot;W-WeIRd....thizzzss isszs wEIrd.... MoUth hard to Zpeak WItH... heAd Burt LiKe helL...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You’ll get used to it within a day or so,&quot; The doctor said then looked at Jacob,&quot;Do you feel alright taking her back with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob nodded as Rebecca started fluttering and buzzing with her wings a bit, and poking one of her antennas before realizing how sensitive to... well... everything they were, they were how she could hear, smell, and she could feel with them and more. One of her arms wrapped around Jacobs shoulder, another around his waist, a third caressing her pussy, and the last cupping one of her breasts. The doctor nodded and allowed Jacob to slowly guide Rebecca out to his van slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could’ve told me beforehand you were going to do this you know, but I appreciate it nonetheless that at least for the next two years I have a strong Queen,&quot; Jacob said as he helped Rebecca into the front passenger seat of the van, and she looked at him and buzzed,&quot;I-I wAnT to H-heLP you.... ThIs moUTH iszz anNoyiNg,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, there’s a cooler with some fruit in it like apples, peaches, grapes, things to basically to eat and test it out your new mouth with down at your feet. I doubt you’re gonna wear much with those delicate wings behind you, and that.... abdomen sticking out of your rump.... heh, let’s just go back to my place and you can rest for the rest of the day, okay?&quot; Jacob asked and Rebecca nodded,&quot;ThANk you.... UnCle...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob then nodded and walked around, starting up the van, and Rebecca reached down into the cooler and pulled out an apple. She lifted it to her mouth and started chewing on it with her mandibles and slowly but surely managed to chew and swallow a small piece of it before moving onto another bite and another. The drive to the apiary where Uncle Jacob lived at was about 30 minutes away and Rebecca was halfway done with the apple by then.<br />
<br />
After he pulled in Jacob looked over at Rebecca and asked,&quot;Are you doing alright girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca looked over and said,&quot;B-Better.... I-I would S-SmIlE b-bUt I cAn’t....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You’re starting to get better with that mouth of yours too, almost formed a clear sentence. The doctor said you would like to make a mini-hive to live in so I put a heater in that old tool shed we have, and I’m going to reinforce it tomorrow. Do you think you can try to come out tomorrow and see how the bees like you?&quot; Jacob asked and Rebecca pauses and nodded,&quot;I-I’ll try....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jacob said before getting out and helping Rebecca out and up into a guest bedroom, bringing up the cooler too, and sitting her down on the bed. The room was a decent size and had a TV in it too, which was nice, and the one thing that Rebecca’s antennae seemed to be attracted to was a flower pot next to the bed. She just felt like rubbing her fuzzy abdomen all along it and pollenate it. She resisted these urges since she was far bigger, but the scent it gave off was so sweet and satisfying odor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’ll just leave you here to munch more on the fruit, just get some rest and take a load off for today, okay? If you feel alright to come outside feel free,&quot; Jacob said and Rebecca nodded and said,&quot;Th-Thank you... I’ll do my best,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl, now rest up okay?&quot; Jacob said and Rebecca nodded before she watched her uncle leave the room. She would finish her apple before moving onto another fruit, which suddenly fruits became a bit addicting, well... anything sweet just sounded nice and tasty to her. She just wondered how she was going to make honey, and how many eggs she was going to lay in a day. An hour or so passed and Rebecca was starting to get over the hangover and even was practicing walking around, and manipulating her four arms and abdomen more. She was astonished at how fluid everything felt after a few minutes of practice, but she was a bit embarrassed about her breasts and pussy, hell even her hips and ass looked big, but instead of an asshole it was her large abdomen sticking out, this was definitely going to get some getting used to...</p>
