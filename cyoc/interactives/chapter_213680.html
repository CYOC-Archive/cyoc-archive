<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roger pumped his arms and felt his body lift into the air.  Each time he pumped, his body flew higher, the city lights grew dimmer, and he travelled further away from the shit life he so desperately wanted to leave behind.  Although he was soaring through the sky, he couldn’t feel the wind rushing past his face.  In fact, he couldn’t feel anything at all.<br />
<br />
As much as Roger wished he could fly, he knew that he couldn’t.  Not in real life anyways.  He was used to this dream – barely a month would go by without him having it.  It was always the same – he would just pump his arms and go as high as he wanted.  For the brief moment that he remained asleep, he could just keep pumping his arms, keep pretending that the dream was real.<br />
<br />
Then something strange happened – a smell began to perforate through his otherwise sensationless consciousness.  It smelled… strange, like wet dog mixed with old fish.  It’s a scent that his brain told him he should find offensive, but at the same time, it smelled… normal?<br />
<br />
Roger tried to place the feeling.  It was almost like smelling his own fart.  The smell itself was “bad” – but the fact that it was coming from him somehow made it smell “good”.<br />
<br />
“Was this smell from outside of the dream?”  Roger wondered.  Did he fall asleep with his nose buried in Lorn’s fur?<br />
<br />
Roger was deep in thought when a sound rattled through his head.<br />
<br />
“Wake up bitch!”<br />
<br />
The unfamiliar voice started Roger to wakefulness.  As groggy eyes flung open, Roger quickly scanned the dark street for the source of the noise.  Standing off to Roger’s side was a tall, heavyset man, whose bulging gut was hanging out above his belt, all while he held a small cologne bottle just inches from Roger’s nose – it was the man from earlier.<br />
<br />
Roger tried to yell out, but all that came out was a high-pitched whine.  He opened his mouth again, but it felt… wrong.  His mouth was too long, his teeth were all weird, and his tongue felt different.<br />
<br />
The heavyset man laughed as he said, “I hope you enjoy the new smell!  Its yours now!”<br />
<br />
Roger didn’t know what the man was talking about, not that doing so was any sort of priority for him right now.  As Roger ran his tongue along the inside of his mouth, he felt a bunch of sharp, pointy teeth – too many teeth in fact.  Did the man kick him in the face?  Was his jaw broken?  Did all of his teeth get shattered?<br />
<br />
Confused thoughts flashed through Roger’s head.  Something was clearly wrong with his mouth but he wasn’t in pain.  He tried to reach up to feel around the inside of his mouth, but moving his forelegs was awkward and all he managed to do was run his paws along the outside of his muzzle.  <br />
<br />
Sensory information flooded his already overwhelmed brain, but everything felt normal.  Every warning light in his body’s control center was off.  As much as his mind knew that something was wrong, his body was sounding an all clear.<br />
<br />
Roger realized that he didn’t have time to think about the conflicting mental and sensory information, he just knew he had to get out of there.<br />
<br />
But Roger’s attempt to rise to his feet only brought on a new conflict between himself and his body as his legs refused to align themselves with his spine.  Pushing off his front paws, he nonetheless managed to rise to a 45 degree angle, before losing his balance and beginning to fall forward.  The last thing Roger saw was a very confused Lorn looking him, before the ground rushed up and his muzzle collapsed between Lorn’s legs.<br />
<br />
Roger could feel his nose press into Lorn’s slick fur, only for it to be filled with a rich, musky scent.<br />
<br />
The image of a thick red cock forced its way into Roger’s mind as his hind legs pressed his butt up into the air, all while his tail involuntarily lifted itself.  Roger felt Lorn move away from him, but the scent lingered in his nostrils, and so did the image of Lorn’s cock.<br />
<br />
Roger’s ears swiveled to sound of the man laughing behind him.  He knew that he had to pay attention to what was going on around him.  He knew he had to get away.  But the saliva lustfully dripping out of his mouth was as clear a sign as any that he couldn’t get the image out of his head.  <br />
<br />
No matter what he tried to think about, no matter what he tried to do.  It was like the world around him had fallen away.  Like all of the sensations of his body didn’t matter.  All that did matter was Lorn’s scent, the feeling of Lorn pressing down from above, the feeling of his own tail wagging against the insides of Lorn’s thighs.  It felt so real, it felt so…<br />
<br />
Intense lines of heat spread out from Roger’s crotch.  They flowed down the bottom of his stomach, causing nipple after nipple to grow slightly erect.  It was when the heat turned his forelegs into jelly that Roger realized that his body had risen itself to all fours – and that Lorn’s body was pressing down on his back.<br />
<br />
Heat turned into pleasure as something hard and thick pressed into his body.  Roger yelped in pain as his dog’s length broke through something inside of him, like a membrane. The pain was quickly subsumed by the strange feelings in his backside. His mind centered on a feeling of diffuse pleasure radiating from a new set of lips and 4 rows of nipples.  It was like each was a tiny furnace, radiating warmth into his surrounding flesh.<br />
<br />
Roger tried to focus his mind, but he could only pant as he felt his body rock back and forth in tune with the larger dog above him. The thought of such a big, virile on top of him, mounting him, made muscles he’d never had before quiver in delight. It was an alien mindset, yet the cock pleasantly stretching his rear made him feel nice and wet. The fish smell intensified as the dog above him growled and ground into his rear.<br />
<br />
He heard a laugh come from his left side and glanced over.  It was like looking through a fog – Roger could see the man standing there, but overlaid on what his eyes were seeing was the mental image of Lorn, and the part of Lorn’s body that Roger knew was now pumping inside of him.<br />
<br />
The man pointed at something and said, “take look bitch, that’s you.”<br />
<br />
Roger didn’t understand, but his gaze followed the man’s outstretch finger until he was staring into a nearby store window.  Roger expected to see his reflection in the window, but instead what he saw were two German Shepards fucking under a streetlight.  And worse, when he looked straight into the window, he was looking straight into eyes of German Shepard that was on the bottom.  He was looking straight into his own eyes.  He was looking straight at himself.<br />
<br />
The dog above him shifted his paws for a better grip, pulling out of her-his hindquarters. Lorn repositioned himself with a growl that was full of need and want and then shoved his big, luscious red cock into her moist, winking lips, clear fluid dripping from his feminine spade. He felt pleasure explode in his brain, making his teats go rigid as the cock speared his lips and spread his cunt wide.<br />
<br />
Wait…his cunt? <br />
<br />
“Why do I have a cunt?”  Roger thought.  <br />
<br />
He was man – a human.  He was supposed to have a cock.  He was supposed to walk upright.  But staring back at him in the window was a dog.  The sensations being transmitted from between his legs were of the warm, filled hole between his legs.  <br />
<br />
He knew that his cock was there, but the more he tried to mentally scan his body, the more he felt… nothing.  There was nothing between his legs, save a pair of small, erect nipples.  Nipples that weren’t alone – the further up his body he mapped, the more there were, each as erect as the last.  <br />
<br />
And the pleasure he felt was so strange, it was like all of the muscles in his body were engage in a permanent massage – they were massaging the cock stuffed inside of him and the nipples running along his belly.  And it all felt so normal.  No matter how much that his mind screamed that something was wrong, his body just kept telling him “You’re not hurt.  This is fine.  This is good.  You want to be fucked.”<br />
<br />
Roger wanted to call out, to ask the man what was going on.  But it was too much.  The sensations were too new, too confusing.  Roger didn’t know what was happening, and he didn’t know what he could do to find out.  Pressure in his new bitch’s spade built and built, as though he were cresting into something amazing. The pleasure inside him was building to a crescendo. He whined and wriggled, pressing back into the massive cock that was filling her up so nicely. Lorn humped him harder, hips a blur, the cock pummeling her insides.<br />
<br />
He felt something at the base of Lorn’s cock begin to expand inside of his cunt. Was…was Lorn knotting him? The thought was like a trigger. As the bulb at the base of the dog swelled, plugging his new hole, it set off a chain reaction. Roger yowled in pleasure, his new cunt spasming and clamping down on his lovely intruder as he experienced his first female orgasm. His teats tingled and he shuddered underneath his dog. <br />
<br />
The big German Shepherd above him gave one final thrust, burying his big red bone inside of her. Then Lorn howled and Roger’s womb filled with a gush of warm fluid. His spade’s muscular contractions continued. Roger could feel that warmth slipping deeper and deeper inside his womb, and the sudden heat that had overtaken him left as quickly as it came.<br />
<br />
Something inside of him knew that was bad, it meant something. But Lorn nuzzled his neck ruff and licked his muzzle. Roger’s body felt good and the after glow was especially intense. He really wanted to do it again, and he found himself panting happily, drool dripping onto the sidewalk.<br />
<br />
“Good girl. You’ll be a great mother.” The fat bearded man said, patting his head.<br />
<br />
Roger whined. Mother?! But his body was telling him that was a good thing too. Lorn was a good choice of mate. <br />
<br />
The man started to walk away as Lorn slipped off to Roger’s side.  Roger wanted to follow, but a sensation of pressure coming from his cunt, followed by a pulling as Lorn began to move to the side told Roger that the two were still connected.<br />
<br />
So Roger just stood there on all fours, staring at the satisfied but confused bitch in the window.</p>
