<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What do you mean Kyle?”<br />
<br />
“I mean,” he nervously gulped, his eyes shuffling back and forth, “for no reason at all, I get really hot and then—well—“<br />
<br />
Kyle didn’t have to finish that sentence. The 6’5”, eight year old boy was having his first encounters with maturity. This was painfully obvious in the mesh shorts that your brother was wearing. All of the sudden and out of nowhere, an enormous bulge appeared just below the overly tight waist band, and was getting bigger.<br />
Kyle flung his arms down to his sides in frustration. “See! I don’t even know why it happens. One second, everything is fine. The next—I feel all weird and—THAT—happens.”<br />
<br />
Kyle’s bulge continued to inflate until a rather large tent stuck straight out from his legs. It was so hard that the waist band had been forced a few inches off of Kyle’s waist. Your mind was racing. You never thought it would be your job to explain the birds and the bees to your younger brother. That’s what parents are for, right? But your brother was obviously in need and was in desperate need of answers. So many things were happening to him that he could never possibly understand. You may not be able to explain why he keeps growing so fast, but at least you may be able to explain this.<br />
<br />
You sat down on the bed next to your brother and took him by the hand. You needed him to feel comfortable and right now Kyle was anything but “comfortable.” His manhood threatened to rip his shorts apart, his skin was flush and even little beads of sweat had begun to form on his forehead. Kyle needed you desperately. You looked Kyle dead in the eyes, took a big breath and said the first thing that popped in your head. “You’re growing up Kyle.”<br />
<br />
Kyle looked down at you incredulously. He was still laying flat on the bed and even huffed a chuckle. “I know. That’s why I’m so big!”<br />
<br />
You held Kyle’s hand firmer & laughed. “I can see why that didn’t make sense. Well, what I mean is, Kyle—you are becoming a— a man.”<br />
<br />
Kyle’s mind began to slowly turn. Flickers of realization replaced lack of belief. “What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“This, Kyle,” you motioned to his shorts, “is something that happens to older boys like---“<br />
<br />
“YOU!” Kyle interrupted excitedly, squeezing your hand tightly.<br />
<br />
“---yeah.”<br />
<br />
Kyle sat up straight in the bed. He was now several inches above you, and both of you were startled by that. “I see what you mean. I AM a big boy!”<br />
<br />
You couldn’t help but flick your eyes at your brother’s rock hard tent. “Yes you are.”<br />
<br />
“So, is this normal?” Kyle asked worriedly.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. It is. Perfectly natural. In fact—“<br />
<br />
Kyle erupted a sudden moan.<br />
<br />
“What?!” you jumped.<br />
<br />
Kyle’s eyes unrolled from the back of his head. “When I touched it, I felt—really good.”<br />
<br />
All you could do was nod. Kyle was picking up on this a lot faster than you had anticipated. “Yeah. It does. Whenever you get hard like this, touching it will make it feel really good. That’s actually how you make it better.”<br />
<br />
Kyle’s eyes lit up, his hand slowly stroking the top of the mound. “Really?! How?”<br />
<br />
“Tell you what. I need to make breakfast anyway. While I’m gone, stroke the long part of your---<br />
<br />
“—of your---“ you choked.<br />
<br />
“Penis?” your eight year old brother reminded you.<br />
<br />
You quickly nodded with relief. “Yes. That. Rub the long part for a couple of minutes and—“<br />
<br />
“You mean this?”<br />
<br />
Kyle was bubbling with excitement at this point. With a few quick moves, he slid around his brother, propelled his feet through the air and finally brought them down with a heavy THUD. Kyle even managed to pull his hardening package from constricting prison.<br />
<br />
You just froze as the oddest combination of fear, excitement and a hint of envy overcame you. Kyle was pulling on the long smooth shaft of his penis. His hand was way ahead of him and knew exactly what to do.<br />
<br />
“Umm- yeah. Just like that.”<br />
<br />
You took this chance to stand up and readjust. Kyle was sad to see you get up, but now used his free hand to completely pull down his shorts. “And like I was saying. AFTER I leave the room---“ you eyed Kyle sharply.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Sorry! Did I need to pull my shorts back up?” Kyle asked innocently.<br />
<br />
You sighed. “No. Ye--- NO—ANYWAY…”<br />
<br />
You took a moment to calm yourself. Kyle was confused and didn’t know why you were so flustered, but he felt it best not to ask. Finally, when you regained your composure, you noticed Kyle had already progressed with his exploration. One hand was pulling up and down the long shaft faster and faster while his other hand explored his long, smooth legs. Kyle’s face flushed even redder and more sweat was starting to drip from him. His legs were sprawled out on the floor, surrounding your own feet between them like two walls. This position left nothing to the imagination, and clearly Kyle lacked the humility to care.<br />
<br />
If you didn’t finish quickly, there would be no later. You decided to get to the point as quickly as possible. You spoke with the pace of a rapid fire automatic. Kyle could barely understand a word you said, partially because he was now really into figuring out what would happen next. “I’m going to go find some food. I’ll be back in a few minutes. You should be finished by then.”<br />
<br />
Kyle moaned. Through his quickening breaths, he responded, “O—k.”<br />
<br />
You took this opportunity to quickly exit the room, forgetting to even shut the door behind you. You just had to get to the kitchen as quickly as you could. As you rummaged around for yours and Kyle’s next meal, you realized just how much Kyle had eaten. “Fine, Cereal it is.”<br />
<br />
You set the box of family sized Fruit Loops down on the counter. You jerked for the cabinet with the bowls but then suddenly stopped. You eyed the box and thought, “He’s not going to need a bowl.”<br />
<br />
A swell of excitement, worry and confusion filled your whole body. You’re excited because it’s not everyday something this unusual happens. You’re worried because you have no idea how this is going to play out. And you’re confused about which feelings should be more important and what your next move should be. All of this in under a second. Ah, the mind of a teenager.<br />
<br />
With the cereal box tucked under your arm, you grabbed an unopened gallon of whole milk and a large plastic cup. Then you headed back for the bedroom. As you drew closer you could hear Kyle’s moans getting louder. They were more like roaring pants. “He’s not done yet?!” you thought to yourself, “My first time, I was done in under a minute!”<br />
<br />
You waited just outside the door for the final moments you knew were soon to come. After about thirty seconds, Kyle let out a long, high pitched moan that rocked the walls. His voice eventually sputtered out into deep, heavy breaths. “Alright, He’s done.”<br />
<br />
You took two steps back into the bedroom shocked by the entire scene. What did you see?</p>
