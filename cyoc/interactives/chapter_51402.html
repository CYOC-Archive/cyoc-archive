<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One thing Gill hadn't expected was for every lion in the room to get into line, including <br />
Mary and her parents. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Gill asked bewildered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well~,&quot; Mary scratching her side Lance left on the chair, &quot;Everyone else was getting in line <br />
so I thought I should too.&quot; <br />
<br />
Felicity defended, &quot;Would have felt rather awkward not to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian just said, &quot;Got caught up in the moment really.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gill face palmed, &quot;I said 'officers' you three aren't. Step aside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; The three original lions echoed respectively and took some steps back leaving <br />
the eleven other lionesses and the other male who was on the opposite end of the line <br />
from Brian. <br />
<br />
Mary secretly was slightly disappointed in that none of the lionesses had colors that while <br />
somewhat fantastic, weren't anything that were completely illogical (none of them had <br />
shades of blue, green, silver or purple for example), Mary knew logically that them being <br />
the bright colors of the rainbow would make hunting totally impractical, last thing you <br />
wanted to do while hunting prey was stand out.  Mary had almost expected all the lions to <br />
turn blue!  That said, their fur color was decently diverse. <br />
<br />
Felicity heard what Madam Serenity said to Bobbi about lions being polygynous. Of course <br />
Felicity had read that too while she and her husband had been looking up details. At the <br />
time of course the two of them were going to be simply the only two lions around, and <br />
then their only choices were to be assimilated into the wolf pack or become like their <br />
daughter and there hadn't been time to consider such thing as giant wolf monsters <br />
beating down your reinforced door.  'Of course we're now basically planning a war council <br />
so it's not like we have time for that now either...' Felicity remembered when Brian had <br />
considered that he might have ended up a lioness opposed to a male... Felicity in spite of <br />
Madam Serenity believing they were being blind knew there were going to be risk, but as it <br />
stood now, it was their only option. <br />
<br />
Trevor found himself eyeing the lionesses carefully in spite of himself. Paul wondered if he <br />
should divert his eyes or not, but he hadn't been for Mrs. Hardy so it would have been <br />
rather silly to begin now. <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity just looked at the lions and seeing one really really big train wreck headed <br />
for an ammunition dump. <br />
<br />
'Is that Gary?' Gill thought something about the color of the lion man's mane being <br />
familiar, 'Well, I'm going to find out soon enough.' <br />
<br />
Truth be told, Gill actually found it strangely jarring with the lions still wearing their <br />
badges like they were pendants while apparently having all the modesty of a career <br />
nudist... Part of Gill wanted to chastise them for being out of uniform, but he doubted <br />
there was anything their size anyway. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let's try this again, you are each to say your name, rank, and mission. Afterwards <br />
we'll begin planning on the best way to neutralize the Smith wolves without killing them <br />
and begin the process of removing their brain washing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bernie raised a paw, &quot;Uh, sir, you could just look up our profiles since our existence as <br />
lionesses as part of the transform cascaded back through the past of the space/time-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In line officer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
June and Pearl were of course with their children, Zack had proven surprisingly diligent in <br />
collecting what supplies they would need for the island. While Martha could certainly look <br />
after all the pups, June and Pearl hadn't had a chance to get to know their children that <br />
well yet and wanted a chance to bound with them as Kaylee had with her children and <br />
Darla with Alice. <br />
<br />
Zelipe talked about his former life in a passive tone, his mind glazing over many many <br />
details, but being able to remember every detail of his collage courses. Amy outright <br />
talked about her former self in third person!  She calmly wrote in kanji while talking to her <br />
mother about her previous parents before Zack and June. June was left stunned after <br />
asking Amy where she had learned Kanji (after being told what it was) when Amy said she <br />
hadn't really 'learned it' at all, she had merely known it after being born into the pack.  <br />
<br />
The gray and silver she wolf look into the eyes of the white and redlined wolf cub, <br />
wondering if there was a deeper meaning to her child. <br />
<br />
That was when three dirty blond busty she wolves came into the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome Beta Females!&quot;  Pearl and June greeted obediently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Betas!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to our room Beta-Sans!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; The triplets echoed, &quot;We have something important Master wishes to ask of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever it is we shall obey.&quot; Pearl replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Say it and it'll be done.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Darla said, &quot;This is regarding your pups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both she wolves eyes widened slightly. <br />
<br />
Julie continued, &quot;So Master wants the choice to be YOURS, given they are your pups and <br />
Zackery's.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is Zackery anyway?&quot; Fran finished. <br />
<br />
&quot;Helping move supplies with other males who are able.&quot; June explained while Pearl hugged <br />
her son closer wondering what Master could possibly want with her child. <br />
<br />
The triplets sighed, &quot;Then I guess we'll have to wait till he gets back.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What is the question?&quot; Pearl asked concerned. <br />
<br />
&quot;As an emergency alternative and delay tactic to the evacuation.&quot; Fran began. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master wants us to use Amy and Zelipe's special talents to convert the unsuspecting and <br />
helpless humans in the various nearby estates into part of the pack to cause our numbers <br />
to basically explode making any threat the two lions pose meaningless.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amy nearly dropped her brush, leaving an ugly mark turning the kanji 'water' into 'ice.' <br />
<br />
While her mother didn't see it, Amy got a look of alarm and foreboding on her face. The <br />
image of a butterfly clawing back into it's cocoon came to mind. Her mind raced. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would it help everybody?&quot; Zelipe asked innocently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear...&quot; Pearl said not letting go of him, &quot;It would, but .. it would be dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A large pack of wolves would be with each of them.&quot; Julie assured, &quot;And there would be <br />
no humans prepared for our arrival through the mirrors.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amy thought of everything Brian had heard about the curse, everything he had known. <br />
Then the sun rose in her head and she moved from her mother to among the triplets. &quot;If I <br />
may, I may have an alternative to the alternative Master-Sama wishes to put forth.&quot;<br />
<br />
The triplets blinked and looked down between their cleavage at the little eight year old <br />
pup. <br />
<br />
Amy put on her best face. &quot;Is there not a part of the art gallery where victims of the curse <br />
doomed to be naught but statues of various sort reside? Both classic and modern? Both <br />
whole and busts? If I may be so bold, would it not be less dangerous for us, and thus less <br />
unwholesome to our father and mothers, for us to collect new wolves from there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would that even work sis'?&quot; Zelipe asked confused.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I do not see why not. They would still have souls would they not? Trapped and doomed <br />
forever to remain but pieces of art, unable to speak, unable to communicate with anyone? <br />
They would embrace us as their saviors regardless of the conditions of the transformation <br />
or not... &quot; 'And it would be something good rather than something evil.' <br />
<br />
The triplets all looked at each other, then at the white/red wolf pup, then at her mother, <br />
then at each other again. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll discuss this with Master at once!&quot; They said together and left at once. <br />
<br />
Amy breathed a sigh of relief. Deep down, some part of her that hadn't existed before her <br />
transformation knew that the wolves could eventually become a beautiful natural part of <br />
the world... but if they continued to treat humans as stock, their future would be a short <br />
and violent one. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Abbey went to go get a tiny compact mirror (the kind Master wouldn't notice her carrying <br />
in a million years and wouldn't act questions on her carrying one when they were moving <br />
out in a rush).  She didn't say anything when she saw Master, after all, it was supposed to <br />
be a surprise what they were doing for him after all. And it wasn't proper to spoil <br />
surprises. <br />
<br />
The master was busy explaining to Kaylee's copies that no, they WEREN'T going to be <br />
regional governors of different parts of 'Big Bad Island.' (Amber had come up with the <br />
name surprising not Amethyst).  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile the red/violet Margot asked, &quot;Megan are you really sure that Zack should go? I <br />
mean, he still has that limp from earlier and males didn't prove that much of a match for <br />
the lions the last time, and he has two pups to think about--&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan exasperated, &quot;Oh come on! He's just Zack! Who cares?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Amy and Zelipe for one...&quot; Anne pointed out politely. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay,&quot; Zack said automatically, &quot;I'm to service you she wolves in all things, I'm.. I'm <br />
sure my pups understand that... &quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone there knew that was just the transformation talking... but so what? Wasn't it the <br />
transformation talking whenever they spoke of Master, or spoke of their pack? Or Spoke <br />
how they were PACK-MATES meant to look out for one another? What difference did it <br />
make?<br />
<br />
Terri defended, &quot;Sandi is already hurt, I don't think she should risk going in again.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Megan said, &quot;So you're more worried about a black eye than a pack mate?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sandi then said lowly, &quot;No... No I'm not... it's... Ashley's more important.&quot; <br />
<br />
Beatrice remembered Pearl's tom-foolery... Pearl had felt guilty and sick over going behind <br />
Master's pack... Beatrice saw none of that in Megan's eyes at all. &quot;Megan.. this is childish. <br />
If Master learns that you did a risk like this without his okay Alpha Female is going to <br />
demand you be added to the gallery!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;ONLY if we don't succeed in getting Ashley back! IF we do, we'll be heroes!&quot; And I'll have <br />
paid back that mangy cat for hurting my brother and for betraying our location to that <br />
fortune teller!! <br />
<br />
Anne said, &quot;As if we failed we'd be statues before tomorrow evening! I don't wanna be a <br />
paper weight!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Chicken!&quot; Megan snapped back. Anne took a step back and shrunk some even though she <br />
was a few inches taller than Megan actually. <br />
<br />
Beatrice was stunned by how suddenly Megan's attitude was changing. &quot;Megan... pack-sis, <br />
I know you're upset about Roger, but this isn't how to make up for things.&quot; <br />
<br />
Megan counted the wolves she had quickly called for this, not counting Zack, 'One, two, <br />
three, four, five, six. Sandi is the only already injured, will need Zack as a meat shield.' <br />
<br />
Megan opened her mouth and spoke, &quot;Jasmine, Margot, Anne, Beatrice, Terri...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so I know,&quot; Lawrence said, his gigantic muscular frame barely covered by the shady <br />
palm tree, &quot;I'm not going to end up looking like you am I? No offense, but I don't think I'd <br />
look good with long hair, flowers and solid color eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Opal and Jasper carry it well.&quot; Carnelian explained calmly having drawn the straw to look <br />
after their 'guest.' <br />
<br />
&quot;All the same I prefer the way I am now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And we all preferred the way we were before we were made into wolves, but we're all new <br />
and improved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the same again, I just prefer things didn't get MORE complicated then they already <br />
are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carnelian waved it off, &quot;Don't worry, Cobalt changed into one of us because of her way of <br />
saying the transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which isn't how it said from what Master said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, none of you have changed yet from being around us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good... we've had ENOUGH changes personally for now. Is she ever going to stop singing?<br />
&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Likely after the sun burns out... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least it's pleasant... Is that the Smurfs theme?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...&quot; <br />
<br />
Amethyst moved like a pleasant summer breeze among her fellow gem colored wolves <br />
who kept expecting her to trip or -something- but moved flawlessly from one gay step to <br />
the next. <br />
<br />
&quot;Opal is so cute! Master is so cute! Jasper is so cute! Roger is so cute! Zack is so cute! <br />
Ulysses is so cute! Nick is so cute!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think the less we worry about it the less it's going to cause trouble.&quot; Ruby said to <br />
Emerald the two of them holding different ends of a tree they had timbered (pulling it up <br />
by the roots was risky business even though possible with their combined effort). <br />
<br />
&quot;At this point I have to agree.&quot; Emerald replied. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Nicole sighed, &quot;We'll do this the old fashioned way, a one and a two and a-&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick blinked away... &quot;Oh... hello Nicole... did we get the fortune teller?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you going to ask what you're doing inside me first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... not really...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicole sighed, &quot;Figured.&quot;</p>
