<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Jill stood there waiting for Saphira's answer but before that could happen she was wrenched out of the dream. She looked up at her 
mother in shock. He mother had a furious expression on her face as she cried out, "What do you think you are doing? You were only 
supposed to go into the dream world and guide her. Not insert new elements into the treatment. Not deliver cryptic messages. What is 
this note and why did you introduce a persona of me?"</p>
<p>Before she could respond Matron Nikl said, "Upping the dosage. Subject is returning to the dream state."</p>
<p>"But she's supposed to come out of the dream state," Jill said confused. "Why are you putting her back in?"</p>
<p>"Because you introduced elements that weren't part of the treatment," Mistress Yu said the look of fury still on her face. "Now 
answer my questions."</p>
<p>"Well I had to meet with her to get her out and the easiest way to do that was to have them come here," Jill said a bit terrified.</p>
<p>"You had that woman use only my surname," Mistress Yu said her face darkening in her anger. "You know how disrespectful that is 
to me."</p>
<p>"That wasn't me Mother," Jill said backing up against the wall. "I would never have done that. Most of the dream was created by 
Saphira I just added to it a bit. Saphira only knows you as Mistress Yu and she didn't think her mother would call you that." She silently 
wondered how her mother knew about this anyway.</p>
<p>"I can accept that," Mistress Yu said taking a deep breath. "What about the note though? You didn't say she had a note when you 
cataloged her personal belongings."</p>
<p>Jill looked down unable to meet her mother's eyes. Before she could say anything though Matron Nikl said, "Structural integrity of 
dream state failing. Mistress Yu, you need to make a decision on what to do. Mutations are getting more severe."</p>
<p>"Let me go back in," Jill said after a moment when her mother didn't say anything. "I can help her out safely."</p>
<p>Before Mistress Yu could respond Matron Nikl said, "Mutations have taken an unknown direction. Foreign parameters have been 
introduced," her voice tinged with a note of fear.</p>
<p>"Do something then," Mistress Yu said starting to panic a bit.</p>
<p>"I don't think I can," Matron Nikl said.</p>
<p>"We have to do something," Jill said fear for Saphira in her voice.</p>
<p>"Mutations are stabilizing," Matron Nikl said shaking her head. "Unknown parameters still in effect. We're losing her." She looked up 
with fear in her eyes and said, "These unknown parameters are taking her from us."</p>
<p>Jill gulped as Mistress Yu turned to her. She would be blamed for this because she introduced some new elements to the dream 
world. Before anything else could happen though the world shifted violently and Jill was no longer at Madam Yu's.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>"Is there a problem, Saphira?" a voice barked out as Saphira sat up in front of Jill and looked around the class. The voice belonged 
to a teacher and when Saphira shook her head he continued, "Then I expect you to pay attention in my class and not fall asleep. I'm 
giving you a detention for tomorrow after school. Now class as I was saying..."</p>
<p>Jill took notes while watching Saphira. She noticed her hand slide down to between her legs presumably to check of she had male or 
female genitals. She would need to figure out a way to ask her about it later because she was sure that they were back before Saphira 
had made her wish. This was confirmed when she took the note from her textbook. Saphira quickly glanced around before opening the 
note which Jill was able to read over her shoulder.</p>
<p><b>You were interesting and your wish was fun and had a few unexpected turns. So sorry it did not turn out the way you wanted. 
Sorry things became so jumbled in the end. Sorry you cannot make another wish to undo the jumbled bits. Hope you are happy. Either 
pass me along or just leave me on the desk and I will find my way.</b></p>
<p>Jill shook her head slightly. Saphira had been a boy before so she should be a boy again and about fourteen judging from the class 
they were in. Instead she was a girl and nine in an eighth grade class. Jill also had to wonder why she had been drawn back to this 
point with Saphira. She still remembered Saphira coming to Madam Yu's and reading her wish on the note. She should still be at 
Madam Yu's never having heard of Saphira or handling the note again. She took a deep breath and sorted through her memories 
seeing if she had any new ones which she did. Her mother decided to send her to public school so as to avoid the appearance of 
favoritism. She had taken the surname of Yu when her mother had adopted her four years ago. Even though this school didn't have a 
school uniform her mother insisted that she dress in a blouse and skirt. She was still fourteen and had some duties at Madam Yu's like 
waking the students in her wing up and cataloging the personal possessions of the boys who came to Madam Yu's.</p>
<p>The bell rang and everyone stood up to leave. Jill noticed that Saphira had left the note one her desk and was tempted to grab it. 
She didn't though as she was almost sure her handling the note a second time was what brought her here with Saphira and she didn't 
want to find out what handling it a third time would do. She would of course keep an eye out for it and help those transformed by it's 
magic. Of course that all depended on her being able to remember things when a wish was granted which was unlikely despite her 
being able to remember what happened before Saphira had torn the note up. As she left to go to gym she was glad that her mother 
wouldn't remember what had happened since now it never happened. Though she still didn't have an answer as to why Saphira hadn't 
changed back into a boy. Maybe it was because she had ripped the dream version of the note. Jill shrugged as she entered the girls 
locker room to get ready for gym. She was almost certain that she would figure it out eventually.</p></p>
