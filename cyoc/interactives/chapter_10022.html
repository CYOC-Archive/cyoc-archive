<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shaggy had one thought in mind and that was to get back into camp to tell his discovery of Simon. He wondered if adding the news of his wish to make Simon as he really was, a sex fiend and one who loved sodomy?<br />
<br />
Batting his was through the tall grass he was getting very fatigued feelings. His arms ached from thrashing the grass while legs seemed oddly heavy. The place he entered the grassy plain could have been anywhere. Shaggy didn't make the place he'd exited the forest, now he felt lost and tired.<br />
<br />
His head was faster and faster showing the changes his foolish wish had ordained to happen. A continuous running nose bothed him as he wiped and wiped it till the hanky he had with him was sopping. Atlast with nothing else to use he just pointed his nose to the ground and gave one hardy snort.<br />
<br />
The place he'd entered the grassy plain was very near, he could almost sense an odor. As he walked nearer the forest's edge his legs started to cramp up. A jerk here and then a hard jolting cramp began at his heel running up the calf of his leg till it knotted his thigh. Screaming of his pains he increased and fingers rubbed the leg in frantic motions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh damn how I hate cramps!&quot; yelled Shaggy.<br />
<br />
Wham, just like that his other leg began to cramp up and he screamed as then both legs from heel to thigh wrenched him in pain.<br />
<br />
Slowly the pain subsided and he calmed down from his agony. Breathing very fast and in heavy gulps Shaggy started to think about those sounds he'd heard Simon do when humping out in the distant field. Easier and slower went his breathing as if some inner strength was telling him that such pains would never happen again.<br />
<br />
A smiked smile came over Shaggy's face as he thought again of Simon and his wild bestial humping he was no doubt enjoying somewhere out in the night. As one arm stretched then flopped aside his head it touched something. <br />
<br />
Fear welled up from this strange touching of something soft and hairy. His eyes shifted right and left not wishing to excite whatever it was into a bite or maybe anger. Breathing began again in quickening rapid deep breaths. Soon the fear, his breathing, all had raised such fear of injury or death he was about to scream and run!<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaya!&quot; yelled Shaggy as he scrambled to his knees and held out clenched fists ready for a fight.<br />
<br />
Nobody was there, he looked about in frantic short and quick moves till he was at last satisfied there was nothing to fear. Now he calmed down once again and turned his face toward the dark forest not far away. As one leg strained to move it felt as if his pants were too tight and constrained the movements of legs and somehow, his feet.<br />
<br />
A set of very nimble fingers up buckled his belt, popped the button, and zipped down the fly. Always ready for some fun he never wore underwear and said many a time how enjoyed the freedom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fucking shit look at me!' screamed Shaggy to discover he was now well named.<br />
<br />
Shaggy was shaggy his legs covered in thick curls of dark brown fur. As fingers combed through the hairs it gave him a sensual shiver like none ever before. One foot pulled loose the pant leg and then the other giving him his first good notice of why his legs cramped.<br />
<br />
Thighs had widened yet were narrow looking like those well remembered strong hind quarters of Simon. As fingers graced the thighs they worked down to what was his knees but now made him stay somewhat hunched. Shins and what was human feet now were longer. His heel was now the hock made for an animal's hind leg. He felt of the strong tendons and hard bone there under.  it wasn't until he touch the tops of his black cloven hooves that the reality sent in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why me, I only wish to be with Simon when he....fucked a...nanny! Oh son-of-a-bit..ch!&quot; The truth was known and he looked over a hairy shoulder cover yet in shirt toward the distant noise of animals in rut.<br />
<br />
Then as the noise urged him on Shaggy felt a desire to remove all his clothing as it wouldn't be needed for long. His shirt came next and with it he rubbed a hairy chest that might have made a champion wrestler proud. Shaggy felt a real pride in his hairy appearence. Dancing in a circle he reached and strained to see everything about the goat creature he was fast becoming.<br />
<br />
He stopped up dead and his eyes went wider than just wide. In one hand was the one thing which to him symbolized being an animal like Simon was, a tail!<br />
<br />
Wham, a cramp hit the palm of his hand spreading up to the wrist, forearm, then upper arm and shoulder. Eyes clenched shut as he bent over and screamed as he'd never screamed. The sound echoed into both forest and field. It was suddenly then the sounds of voices coming from the forest made Shaggy open his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh damn, damn I don't want anybody to see me like this!&quot; said Shaggy with a groan.<br />
<br />
A fast as he could his arms racked in pain he ran out into the tall grass a hope to hide till whoever it was, was gone away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Run, run, faster damn, it you fool run!&quot; said Shaggy to himself as he even had a little wonder why he ran so very fast and dodge with such agility. The voices faded and with their distant sound he calmed and slowed down to a easy walk.<br />
<br />
A scrunch ahead had him turn his attention. Ears perked up and he stood very quiet. Then from out of the grass ahead came Simon and his small herd of a dozen nannys.<br />
<br />
Shaggy felt much at ease until his nose caught the whiff of a rich and musky scent. His tail began to wiggle as the strange feeling built in his groin. It wasn't until the feeling of a erection coming on reminded him he was not himself, he was a buck goat about to be in rut.</p>
