<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt looked away from the mirror to see the exact same body standing inside the locker room doorway, mouth agape at the sight in front of him. The coach had been in the act of throwing on a wife-beater before he walked in, now all he could do was stare. Matt took a side step away from the cum crusted mirror, and the coach stepped away from the door. It was the first time Matt had really moved around in his new body, he savored his new height, eye to eye with his old idol, who now looked helplessly confused.<br />
<br />
They circled each other like that, until Matt found himself with his back to the locker room door, and the coach pulled his eyes away from Matt to gasp at the cum all over the sink, mirror and floor. Matt turned around and locked the door. He turned back and grinned widely.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Lee, locked in a room with your perfect double. What's it gonna be, fuck or fight?&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach's eyes got wide, but his open mouth didn't make a sound. Matt licked his lips and took a step forward. The coach's whole body tensed. Matt continued toward him, and Lee didn't back away. Soon they were nose to nose, almost chest to chest, and Matt's cock was slowly inflating into the coach's shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's it gonna be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt saw the Coach’s eyebrows furrow a moment too late. Lee shoved his Double with all his strength, sending the unprepared Matt flying back into the door. Despite the shock at being thrown into a door by this giant muscle man, Matt still reflected on the fact that he should be much more severely hurt, his new muscle absorbing almost all the impact, his new strength preventing the Coach from hurling him as far as he would’ve flown in his scrawny old body. <br />
<br />
“Fight huh? Funny, I was sure you were gonna pick fuck!” Matt yelled as the Coach slammed him against the wall again.<br />
<br />
“Who the hell are you and why do you look like me?”<br />
<br />
”I AM you Lee!” Matt tossed Lee’s arms off him and knocked him backwards<br />
<br />
“Bullshit!” Lee flew forward again and Matt shoulder him in the ribs, sending the two 6’4” muscle studs bounding off each other. Matt actually laughed. He’d been bullied a lot in high school. He wasn’t a fighter by any stretch, but he had been picked on so much he had learned a thing or two about dodging a blow. Lee was in a rage at Matt’s guffaw, and whipped around quickly with a fist for Matt’s jaw.<br />
<br />
Matt ducked just in time and closed his eyes, jamming his fist hard as he could into the Coach’s solid abs. When he opened his eyes, his idol of a Coach was doubled over clutching his stomach. Wow, with these muscles it almost doesn’t matter if I’m a good fighter. Matt’s back straightened as the cocky smirk returned to his face.<br />
<br />
Lee lunged again, catching Matt low around the waist and hurtling with him over one of the benches, rolling onto the floor. Matt’s head slammed hard against the tile floor, but Lee’s head fell straight into a locker. Both studs saw double as the awkwardly grappled amongst the discarded clothes scattered around the floor. Coach recovered first, socking Matt in the jaw. Matt started thrashing around sporadically, banging Coach into the locker a couple more times and finally wriggling out from under him and scrambling up. <br />
<br />
Matt was still used to the tactics he had employed as a skinny loner, he could move very quickly. Coach, native to the over muscled body, had a different fighting style completely and couldn’t seem to land a solid blow on his Double, with all his scrambling around.<br />
<br />
“Come on Lee! Doesn’t have to be like this! If you can’t get along with yourself who can you get along with?”<br />
<br />
Matt had to roll away quickly as the Coach bore down to tackle him again. With a quick side swipe of his leg, Matt swept Lee’s legs out from under him, sending the big man crashing down onto one of the benches, splitting it in two. Dazed again, Lee felt himself being dragged over to another bench, with a quick thrash he loosened his Double’s grip on him enough to kick him in the stomach. All at once, Matt fell on top of him, trying to pin him down. They struggled back and forth for a minute, but ultimately Lee threw the naked man off him. Just as he was about to return the favor and pounce on the duplicate, Matt reached out and thrust his finger into the Coach’s armpits, tickling the Coach away from him.<br />
<br />
Matt scrambled up again and had enough time to bound into the Coach while Lee recovered from the thought of being tickled in a fight. They each caught the other around the shoulders, each trying to get his knee up enough to repel the other, circling around each other with teeth barred, pushing…. But they were evenly matched. Matt smiled<br />
<br />
“Believe me yet?”<br />
<br />
Coach wavered and Matt slammed him into the mirror, pinning the Coach in an awkward position, grabbing the waist-band of Lee’s shorts and yanking them down.<br />
<br />
“Fuck you!” Lee screamed “Get your hands off me, I knew you were a fucking queer!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but did you know that YOU’RE a fucking queer too?” Matt menaced. Lee managed to kick backwards, but the act ripped his shorts in two. Matt scrambled back up and tried to get to the locker… if he could reach the Wand he could really make Coach into a cock-hungry homo…<br />
<br />
Thick arms shot under his own as the Coach tried to get the retreating stud into a Nelson. Escaping this technique was a skinny-Matt specialty. In a second he ducked out from under the Coach and pivoted behind him, locking the Coach in a double-Nelson of his own.<br />
<br />
This felt amazing! Feeling the Coach’s big body squirm between his two giant arms, huffing and screaming in impotent rage. Matt had never returned the favor when the high-school jocks bullied him, now that he was in control of the situation he felt incredible, he had subdued this giant stud without magic (well, besides changing into the Coach that is…) and may actually win this fight—<br />
<br />
Lee screamed and bucked backward, sending both men into the wall, and dropping onto the ground. Lee felt a splat against his hip as he landed in a puddle of jizz below the sink. He whirled around with a left hook into Matt’s face, jamming his right elbow into Matt’s stomach. Matt scrambled along the wall away, but didn’t get far before Lee delivered a kick to his ribs. Matt went for a leg-sweep again and once again brought Lee to the floor. Both men scrambled up and away from each other, Matt’s ribs aching and Lee’s head pounding.<br />
<br />
The two men huffed apart from each other, then ran full speed at one another again, grappling in the center of the locker room. Feeling Lee maneuvering him into place, Matt grabbed the muscle stud by the balls and gave a tug. Coach gave a yelp and hopped away, leaving Matt doubled over, smiling and panting. He jumped at the Coach again, fingers tickling at the man’s balls, his finger nails just catching the folds on the man’s sack. Coach stumbled backwards again enraged.<br />
<br />
“Faggot! You are NOT me! I would never fight that way! I am gonna beat the shit out of you and find out who you are from the fucking coroner!” <br />
<br />
Matt was once again slammed into the wall, so hard it almost knocked the wind out of him. He turned around with a cry and punched the Coach’s face as hard as he could. The two men stood apart, fists up, then they attacked. The soft pounding of flesh against flesh filled the empty locker room. They no longer grappled, for they were evenly strong, and Matt’s dirty tricks always won out over Lee’s superior skill. But even though he was in the Coach’s body, and equally strong, he was no match for Lee in terms of boxing. He was getting backed into a corner further and further away from the Wand.<br />
<br />
Matt lunged forward with a yell, knocking the Coach out of the way. The Coach grabbed at him as he ran past, but their sweaty bodies slipped away from each other. Tripping over a fragment of one of the benches on the floor, Matt found himself face to face with his specially prepared towel. He heard the Coach standing up behind him, and he flung the towel backwards.<br />
<br />
The towel caught Lee square in the face, and he scrambled to pull the towel out of his eyes. Freeing himself, he looked across the room and his Double kneeling against a bench, watching his body pant so hard made Lee realize how deeply he was gulping down air. Keeping his eyes fixed on Matt, Lee ran the towel over his sweaty body, scrubbing at the cum that was now drying on his hip, mopping up the rivulets of sweat that had made his body so slippery, leaving a strange tingling sensation behind. Matt finally managed a smile. It was now or never.<br />
<br />
Matt lunged again catching the Coach off guard. The Coach tried to block his face, but Matt surprised him by catching him again on the shoulders, and the stood locked in place. Lee stood on the towel, struggling against what suddenly felt like superior might. Before long, Matt was pushing him back, his feet sliding backwards with the towel. Lee was reaching up to grab the Double’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
Finally Matt let go and Lee tumbled forward a second before Matt delivered a punch to his shoulder. Matt rushed him again and jammed a fist in his belly, sending him flying back into the lockers with a clang. The Coach crouched and lunged at the man’s waist but barely moved the man at all before Matt pivoted and socked Lee in the jaw. The Coach spun around from the force of the impact and collapsed onto the towel. He stood back up and backed into the center of the room, using the towel to wipe the sweat out of his eyes, it felt like he was staring up at his Double across the room, his Double who now wore a huge smile. <br />
<br />
Matt turned back to walk to his locker and Lee dashed forward to wrap his arms around Matt’s throat. But in a second Matt had thrown the Coach over his shoulder and backed away panting, waiting for the next move.<br />
<br />
Lee looked down at himself, his hairy chest was matted with sweat, and all his muscles bulged beneath his taught skin, pumped with exertion. He looked up at Matt, his muscles looked exactly the same, even down to the way the sweat beaded between his two giant pecs. Coach screamed and rushed at Matt trying to get his arms. Lee crashed into Matt and bounced back, before Matt lunged and pinned his arms around his body. Lee gasped aloud. He was now about eye-level with the Double’s collar-bone. He squirmed against the iron grip, but he was no match for his full-sized body now. Suddenly he felt his feet leave the floor, he looked down to see his opponent’s arms bulging and his face splitting with a wide grin. Before Lee could even process how easily he had been picked up, he was in mid-air, heaved across the room. <br />
<br />
He staggered back to his feet, head spinning. He heard bare feet running across the floor, by the time he looked up he was staring into his former nipples, Matt picked him up again and threw him across the room like a rag doll, the lockers absorbing the impact. Lee couldn’t take much more of this, this wasn’t an even fight anymore. He rushed at the identical giant again, put his arms could barely even reach his Double’s chin, so he started pounding away on Matt’s chest as hard as he could, but the behemoth didn’t show any reaction except a laugh at the sound of tiny fists thumping against his pecs. Lee felt himself picked up again and slammed into a wall, his tight muscles straining against the cool brick. The big duplicate behind him held him against the wall, a foot off the ground, with one arm, and with his other hand was cupping the miniature musculature of Lee’s ass.<br />
<br />
“Give up, Lee?”<br />
<br />
“Fuck you! Go to hell!”<br />
<br />
Lee dropped suddenly to the ground. Giant arms enveloped him again, and Matt leaned into his ear as he caught the smaller man in a sleeper hold. Lee quickly felt himself growing queasy amid the iron grip. Matt exhaled against his neck.<br />
<br />
“Want me to stop?” Lee struggled against the bigger arms, even lifting his feet off the ground, kicking wildly: Matt’s arm didn’t even droop. Matt guessed that the Coach couldn’t be any more than 4’6”, 4’9”.<br />
<br />
“Alright!” Lee gasped “Please!” Still, the arms didn’t let up, Lee felt himself at the brink of unconsciousness when Matt suddenly released him, catching his little body before he slumped to the floor.<br />
<br />
“That’s better.” Matt effortlessly picked up the tiny Coach and slung him over his shoulder, patting his ass as he carried him over to a bench. “Unfortunately you’ve been a very bad boy, and need to be punished.”<br />
<br />
Lee could barely put up a fight as Matt sat down and laid his Coach across his lap, exposing his perfectly small ass. Lee jumped when he felt the first slap across his butt, he began to squirm.<br />
<br />
”Wait! What the hell!” Another slap stopped him short. He couldn’t struggle much at all: Matt’s giant hand kept him pinned to his knee. Matt’s hand covered his entire ass every time he brought it down on the little muscle man, the giant rubbed his reddening ass between volleys of slaps. Finally, putting away the pretense, Matt resumed spanking Lee long and hard, until Lee was grunting against the pain, then yelling with every hit, then sobbing out apologies and begging for relief. Matt let the little man cry prone across his lap: great heaving sighs that came out in high-pitched whimpers.<br />
<br />
Lee felt himself cradled in the bigger stud’s arms like a baby as his tears subsided. He was too ashamed to look his opponent in the face, but couldn’t help but stare at the huge chest he was pressed against. Thinking that this is how he used to look to the kids in this school, now that he was a little bit smaller than they were. He was exhausted from the fight and from the spanking. <br />
<br />
Matt was getting off on the power in his new body. Now that he was actually handling someone smaller than his new body for the first time he really realized how strong he was: he let go of the Coach and gripped the tiny man under his arms holding him up to look at himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Look at you Lee. You’re all man, but you’re so tiny now. You’re the size of a fucking ten year-old boy, but you got the muscle definition of a big jock stud. Look at those nice heaving little pecs, they’re so hard, look at that sexy hair all over those mini-abs.” Matt bounced Lee up and down to watch the tiny Coach’s little cock bob up and down. “Now look at what you used to be” Matt said moving the little man aside to get a better view of himself in the cum-stained mirror. Matt noticed the Coach was now springing a woody, and he smiled to himself. He cradled the little muscle-stud against himself again, rubbing the smaller man’s cock against his brick-like abs and carried him over to the locker where his Wand was waiting.</p>
