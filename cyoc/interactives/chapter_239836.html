<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emerging from a portal of shadow, Annie Pendragon let out a nervous breath as she stared at the cabin. It couldn&#39;t be possible, could it? Was Lilith Kane alive?<br />
<br />
Nervously approaching the door, Annie knocked on the door, anxiously awaiting an answer. As the door opened, the womans eyes went wide as she gazed into the blue eyes of someone she hadn&#39;t seen in over 10 years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Annie,&quot; Lilith gasped.<br />
<br />
The former couple stood awkwardly for a moment before Annie lept at Lilith squeezing the woman in a tight hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were dead,&quot; Annie whispered, her voice breaking as tears slowly ran down her cheeks. Holding Lilith at arms length, Annie wiped her eyes as she gave her old girlfriend a warm smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve missed you,&quot; she sniffed. &quot;I heard a rumor that you came back, but I didn’t believe it. How is that even possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still trying to figure it out myself,&quot; Lilith shrugged. &quot;I...I missed you too. The last time I saw you was...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The beach.&quot; Annie finished.<br />
<br />
Lilith and Annie paused recalling their final moments together. The pairs relationship was passionate yet rocky, their own immaturity leading to pointless teenage arguments. It felt stupid in retrospect, wasting precious time together because of teenage insecurities. In the end, as Annie held Lilith tight they realized just how much they truly cared for one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s Alyssa?&quot; Annie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing,&quot; Lilith smiled. &quot;Since I came back we&#39;ve been trying to get to know her. I have a lot of time to catch up on. I guess... we have a lot to catch up on too.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Lilith reached out, Annie took a small step back, a sad expression on her face. &quot;I wish we could Lilith,&quot; Annie sighed. &quot;But I can&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith gave her old girlfriend a curious look as Annie began to change. The woman&#39;s skin taking on a purplish hue, a small set of horns emerging from her forehead as two large bat like wings emerged from her back. Lilith gawked at the demonic form of her former girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After you died,&quot; Annie said sadly. &quot;Everyone kind of drifted. Bong, Misery, and I took it the hardest. Death Riot...well the band broke up, went their separate ways. In the end it was just Misery and I. That&#39;s when it took a bad turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith now listened as Annie explained what happened with her and Misery. What no one knew upon the Demon Queen Lilith&#39;s death was that a power vacuum was created in Hell. For eons Lilith ruled a portion of Hell, fulfilling her duties as one of its rulers. When she died, chaos erupted soon after. Someone needed to rule a portion of Hell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Misery went into a dark place after you died,&quot; Annie said sadly. &quot;You know how she saw you as a daughter. She grew darker, more violent. When she learned that someone needed to become one of the Queens of Hell, she became obsessed. She wanted that power and I couldn&#39;t let her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because,&quot; Annie continued. &quot;Hell corrupts you in one way or another. Considering Misery&#39;s dark intentions, she would have become a threat to everyone. I fought her and eventually won. Misery left town and I became Annie Pendragon, the Demon Queen of Sorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Lilith said sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not your fault Lilith,&quot; Annie replied with a soft smile. &quot;This was a choice I needed to make. I wish we could be together, I hope you feel the same, but time...it was just never on our side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith turned her head slowly, noticing an obviously perplexed Alyssa. &quot;Alyssa,&quot; she said quickly, nervously straightening her shirt. &quot;Sorry, I..I didn&#39;t hear you this is..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Annie,&quot; the demon queen finished. &quot;I&#39;m.... an old friend of your mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alyssa seemed confused as the purplish demon now studied her carefully. For Annie, it felt like she was looking through a time machine. Alyssa was the spitting image of her mother. Seeing that now made the demon&#39;s eyes begin to dampen, thoughts of her time with Lilith now at the forefront of her mind. So caught up in nostalgia, she failed to notice two tears fall from her eyes until they began sizzling on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Annie replied sheepishly, wiping her eyes. &quot;Forget that happens sometimes.&quot; Composing herself, the demon queen of Sorrow now composed herself, reverting to her human form once more as she cast her former girlfriend&#39;s child a soft smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;My goodness you look just like your mother. I haven&#39;t seen you in at least 11 or 12 years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa,&quot; Lilith stated. &quot;This is Annie. We.. um used to date.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, time out mom,&quot; Alyssa said quickly. &quot;You used to date a demon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t always a demon,&quot; Annie replied meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look WHATEVER,&quot; Alyssa exclaimed. &quot;Things have been weird enough lately and now this! I need explanations and I need them now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually I do too,&quot; Lilith stated. &quot;How did you know I was alive and why hasn&#39;t anyone else come by? Where&#39;s Misery?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we sit?&quot; Annie asked. Lilith nodded, escorting Annie and Alyssa towards the kitchen table. As they took their seats, Lilith and Annie exchanged awkward glances as Alyssa lowered at them, anxiously awaiting for more of her mother&#39;s history to be revealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um not sure where to begin,&quot; Lilith shrugged. &quot;Um, do you want something to drink Annie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No that&#39;s okay,&quot; Annie said. &quot;I suppose it&#39;s best we tell Alyssa everything that&#39;s happened as well as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith and Alyssa now sat back, watching as Annie took a breath. &quot;Your mother and I dated through high school,&quot; Annie stated. &quot;It&#39;s was...tumultuous.. Passionate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay ew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa,&quot; Lilith hissed. Alyssa quieted, blowing out an exasperated sigh as Annie continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never felt like I did when I was with Lilith,&quot; Annie said. &quot;We were great together but, as time went on, we let our insecurities get in the way. One moment it was passionate, toe curling, love. The next, we were arguing about the stupidest, most immature things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I get it yeesh,&quot; Alyssa exclaimed. &quot;Can you not talk about how you and my mon scissored each other?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Annie blushed, Lilith turning an equally bright shade of red as the former couple now exchanged shy glances. &quot;I won&#39;t get into the gory details but, we got into a fight, Lilith went to a college party, got drunk, and well...you happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh awesome I&#39;m here because of a one night stand,&quot; Alyssa replied sarcastically. &quot;Anything else you wanna share? Was I born with a tail or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa please,&quot; Lilith said firmly. &quot;Let Annie finish. This is important.&quot; Once more Alyssa quieted, simply rolling her eyes as Annie composed herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith explained the situation,&quot; Annie stated. &quot;And...well...I forgave her. I still loved your mother...I still do. I was willing to help her raise you Alyssa, then..Lilith got sick. After that, and some other things, we found out it would be impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two reasons,&quot; Annie stated. &quot;First, when Death Riot broke up and Luca died, it became readily apparent that Eliana and Rebecca needed to go into hiding. The second reason, the Amberhills and others discovered you were the last living heir of the Kane Demon Hunting family. The church wanted to take you in as their ward...to train you to be their personal assassin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alyssa gawked, along with Lilith. That part neither Kane woman knew. Both were aware of their heritage, yet neither knew that the church wanted an infant Alyssa to train as Demon hunting assassin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew Lilith would never want that for you,&quot; Annie continued. &quot;That&#39;s when I asked Caleb Moreland for help. He was the most well respected demon hunter in the world. He also understood that turning Alyssa into the church&#39;s personal attack dog was wrong. That&#39;s why he helped Eliana and Rebecca go into hiding, with no one knowing where. Not even me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith and Alyssa were speechless, noting the sorrow on Annie&#39;s face. While willing to care for her former girlfriend&#39;s daughter, by doing so it would put the girl in danger of being turned into a weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Annie,&quot; Lilith said softly. &quot;Thank you. I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t easy. But you did a great thing for Alyssa. But, I have to know.... what happened to Misery?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I&#39;m not sure of,&quot; Annie stated. &quot;She wanted to take Alyssa as well. She cared for the girl, the same way she cared for you Lilith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick question: who&#39;s Misery?&quot; Alyssa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A wizard,&quot; Lilith stated. &quot;A very dark wizard but, she protected me. Took me in when no one else would. She may have only been a few years older than me, but she was the closest thing to a mother I ever had. I...I loved her for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And she loved your mother like a daughter,&quot; Annie added. &quot;When your mother died, it broke her inside. She began to delve deeper into dark magic. Slowly losing her mind. After Alyssa was put into hiding, she began to lose her mind. Obsessed with not only punishing those that threatened the innocent but, those who took Alyssa as well. That&#39;s when we found out about the rebellion in Hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith and Alyssa listened carefully as Annie described what happened. Darker forces and minor demons were vying to ascend the throne left vacant by Lilith the Demon Queen. If the wrong demon assumed power, no one would be safe. Eventually Misery and Annie fought off the so called usurpers. Annie, seeing that the power would corrupt an already vengeful Misery further, fought her for the thrones.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won,&quot; Annie said. &quot;But it was luck. Misery&#39;s skill and power eclipses most wizards out there. When I became the Demon Queen of Sorrow, I banished Misery from Hell. She&#39;s still out there, I just don&#39;t know where. All I know is she&#39;s dangerous. Thankfully, I have contacts in Hell that told me of a rumor that you were alive Lilith. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here and no one else. I&#39;m the only one that knows.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith nodded, standing up as she now squeezed her old girlfriend in a tight hug. &quot;Thank you Annie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome Lilith,&quot; Annie replied. &quot;And if you&#39;re ever in trouble, just call my name. I promise, no one will ever hurt the two of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you go, I know Misery might be a little hard to track down, but have you heard anything from Bong?&quot; Lilith asked shrugging her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah. I did manage to catch one of her shows a few months back when she was in the states.&quot; Annie answered handing Lilith a card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her shows? Glad to know, she hasn&#39;t changed.&quot; Lilith said as Annie snickered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you didn&#39;t know? She doesn&#39;t go by Bong-Cha anymore, she goes by Bomb-Pop.&quot; Annie corrected her old friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bomb-Pop? Oh my god, mom, you know Bomb-Pop?&quot; Alyssa asked her mother excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I....guess I do.&quot; Lilith answered unsure if she knew her as well as she used to.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s pretty hard to contact these days, but I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll make an exception for you.&quot; Annie said as she looked over at Alyssa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa, you be a good girl and listen to your mother now, okay?&quot; Annie said as she prepared to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise to listen only most of the time.&quot; Alyssa replied as Lilith glared at her. Annie chuckled at this.<br />
<br />
Annie now waved goodbye as she formed a portal back to hell.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know some pretty cool people mom.&quot; Alyssa complimented her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I do. Annie&#39;s really special, I&#39;ll try calling Bong tomorrow. Now get to bed, you&#39;ve got school tomorrow.&quot; Lilith ordered her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....okay. Night mom, love you.&quot; Alyssa said as she went to bed.<br />
<br />
Lilith looked at the glamorous business card and wondered just how much her old friend had changed.</p>
