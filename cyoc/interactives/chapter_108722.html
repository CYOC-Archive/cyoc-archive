<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the middle of the night, a thief breaks into a high tech lab and steals various things and experiments from the lab. What he didn&#39;t know was that all the items were the first attempts at real life tfs, most of which were perfected not long ago. The thief, assuming he tripped a silent alarm, made a mad dash to leave with all the items he had, and went to all the places where he would securely hide everything for when he got out of prison to gather them all and sell them. The police caught him before he could hide everything. The hiding places were as follows:<br />
<br />
-he hid a ring with an orange gem in a busted car <br />
-he hid a purple bottle with clear liquid in it in the backyard of a small family<br />
-he hid a laptop with a 3D model program in the local library<br />
-the metal box he took was found in its spot while he was hiding it<br />
-he kept the bowler hat on him, but it was confiscated until he would get out<br />
<br />
Most of the hidden items were found, but not by the authorities...<br />

TF Gone Real Part 1: Bubble Bath...?<br />
<br />
1 week later, a 14 year old named Donald Derinn had been hanging in his room reading. He had been grounded from the electronics when his mom remarried and his stepdad caught him watching tf videos. His mom had seen him before, but his old dad had convinced her to leave Donald alone and let him watch it. Now that he wasn&#39;t convincing her, she finally got to ground him for it. Donald wasn&#39;t particularly healthy, a bit on the fat side. He always thought that he was fine, and didn&#39;t need to change. He was getting ready to go over to his dad&#39;s new house. &quot;Remember, Donald is not allowed to have technology, he is grounded.&quot; His mom was telling his dad. He was just nodding and occasionally saying &quot;uh-huh,yeah.&quot; to avoid suspicion. He was looking up the stairs for Donald. Donald was already racing down the steps, shaking the staircase and his belly with every step. His dad has already ignored mostly everything his ex wife said, and was ready to enjoy a week of fun with his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, he has soccer on Wednesday!&quot; his mom shouted out as Donald and his dad were driving away. Donald was already on his dad&#39;s tablet, looking up new stories on cyoc.net.<br />
<br />
5 HOURS LATER...<br />
<br />
Donald had eaten dinner with his dad. He tended to eat big meals at dinner because A). He&#39;s rich and B). He skipped breakfast and lunch the to him being so busy at his job. Donald was raised to be polite and eat what was on his plate. After dinner, he felt extremely bloated, and thought that he might put on about 5 or 10 pounds if he didn&#39;t exersice tomorrow. To stop the bloating, he decided to take a bath. He went into the bathroom to find a purple bottle with a note reading &#39;found this, enjoy Donald!&#39;. His dad always got the weirdest gifts, and this bottle of bubble bath takes the cake. Nevertheless, he liked bubble baths.<br />
<br />
Rinning warm water and taking off his clothes, he finally realised for the first time how big his belly was. Sure, he could sometimes use it as a table, and it was normally really bouncy anyway, the huge meal made it almost as big as his dad&#39;s on a regular day. He liked it, but it hurt with him being so bloated. A bath usually worked for bloating. He poured some bubble bath into the tub, and it glistened a rainbow of colors, then it dissolved and started bubbling. He stepped in, expecting a normal bubble bath, but felt a sudden shock of something he never felt before. it was warmth, pleasure, and static electricity all in one. He stepped in some more, ltitle by little, until his whole body was submerged up till his head. Donald felt all powerful, like he could do anything without having to lift a finger. He loved this feeling, and wished he could stay in this tub forever to experience it. That&#39;s when the magic happened<br />
<br />
The bath shimmered the colors it did before, and things happened he never would have expected to happen. a fridge door appeared in the wall, fully stocked with food and drinks. a tv was in front of him, with over 1000 channels, all in hd. a bookshelf was next to the bed with all the books he could ever want. the walls turned a deep green, his favorite color, with blue swords in a certain pattend he couldn&#39;t describe. He had no idea why th is was happening. then he remembered back 4 days ago when on the news it said that a thief stois several tf items from a lab, one of which was a purple bottle with the ability to morph reality when the contents were mixed with water. Donald was awestruck at the idea that he had this power. He poured some more in, realising that the contents replenished itself, meaning he had infinite uses. He knew about 1000 different things he could do with this, but he knew exactly what he should do first. He concentrated on it very hard, and ended up saying...</p>
