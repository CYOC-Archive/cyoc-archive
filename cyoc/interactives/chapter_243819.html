<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff and Francine took Steve out to do some magical reconnaissance and the Wizard said &quot;Yep... the magical aura of the area is getting thicker than it naturally should. I&#39;m guessing some sort of magical modification effect on how magical Osmosis works.&quot;<br />
Jeff nodded &quot;And in terms of our progression the the Archmage&#39;s lair?&quot;<br />
&quot;Francine&#39;s quick on her feet, you&#39;ve got your gun... and squirrels in highly magical areas use wind blades and wind magic to gather nuts.&quot; Steve tried explaining the potential dangers<br />
Francine said &quot;...So we stick around the more mundane areas till we get better armor or magic gear? Still need to find some cache or dungeon first.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ya&#39;ll brought shovels right?&quot; Steve asked<br />
Jeff took out some of the steel shovels that David&#39;s smithery allowed for &quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
Steve pointed downward &quot;There&#39;s been a concentrated number of magical pockets beneath our feet, there&#39;s probably a dungeon we have to dig into. In terms of combat I know what is effectively shocking grasp and firebolt.&quot; <br />
Francine sighed as she took out her shovel as the two started their first delve which they&#39;d be ready to seal off if their lives got into any serious danger. <br />
<br />
Clara finished tending the food farm and they&#39;d be able to have bread soon... She thought as the wheat looking crop was maturing. Meanwhile there was the magic garden where it seemed like the more she talked to the plants and gave them attention the better they grew... Maybe she should consult Steve about the plants which may or may not be feeding off her emotions or something. Still they were growing. <br />
<br />
David had ended up following Carl into the mines. He had optimized the Cabin as much as he wanted to with their current level of materials or amount of materials. He figured going to mine in pairs would be good both to get materials back to base, if something new was found David could probably tinker and find out how to use it, and if Carl got into any problems David could always try to help him out or let everyone else know... Plus David was a lot better at Carl at making mining supports. <br />
&quot;Hey Dave!&quot; Carl called out as David was preparing a minecart to go back to base<br />
David hurried over asking &quot;Something the issue?&quot; before seeing Carl showing David his hands. His right one looked more slender, and David saw some ore that seemed to be glowing pink. The two looked at each other &quot;...It emits light, it&#39;s some magical material... and it feminizes us doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Seems like it&quot; Carl said seeming a bit unhappy that he had a woman&#39;s hand. <br />
David sighed &quot;Looks like I&#39;m going to be a woman for a bit... I&#39;m the one doing most of the smelting and crafting so I&#39;ll be near this for a while... Go mining in a different direction and find some manly version or something.&quot;<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; Carl asked<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like my value at all comes from Testosterone. I design stuff, and if I&#39;m working with this feminizing material that could give us who knows what then I&#39;ll just be a woman or something. I get the feeling the Archmage doesn&#39;t want any actual irreversible harm or effects happen to us so. I&#39;ll just be a woman for a bit.&quot; David monologued for a bit as he gestured for Carl to go and retain his testosterone and hopefully hit a vein of the opposite of this pink stuff. David wondered if he should go to the bathroom one more time, but... no... this was fine. He spied the crack in the shaft that held the pink magical minerals and started mining the ore. Who knows what it would allow him to craft... her to craft. David&#39;s arms weren&#39;t strong as he exercised his fingers and mind more than most of the rest of his body. A somewhat chubby nerd actually mining and the mining process took him a bit. When his arms got tired he crafted some primitive refineries to get some of the mineral refined. It didn&#39;t take much time for David to look down and spy his breasts starting to grow in, and after checking to see if Carl was around David took a peek into his trousers and under the bask of the pink glow his buddy wasn&#39;t fairing very well and was visibly shrinking. After a few minutes David saw that he got an ore from the minerals and could make a pink pickaxe that worked REALLY well... it&#39;s just... David wasn&#39;t a he anymore. David also wondered how well Carl would take either not being the strongest frontliner if he decided being a woman was a step too far from now. The base armor and gear he made from the feminizing mineral still had that radiation to it. She stored them away in lead chests which seemed to work as Carl didn&#39;t start growing boobs next to them. <br />
<br />
Clara done in the fields was brewing some tea as her mining boys came out from the basement and- &quot;The heck happened to you David?&quot; she asked as she saw Carl walking up after a familiar looking woman in David&#39;s clothes. <br />
&quot;There&#39;s this minerals that was too good not to use, but does this to people... I think it just turns things female and may have other useful properties.&quot; David said &quot;Carl, go ahead and take a shower first. The furnaces are refining the mineral so the water should be hot.&quot; Carl nodded as the adventurers were coming in. The warrior/ranger, a runner/rogue, and the wizard coming back with their clothes slightly torn up and looking weary. <br />
Jeff said &quot;I was about to say we had an adventure, but the heck happened to you?&quot;<br />
David said &quot;Magical feminizing ores. Our tools and armor should be upgradable with it but-&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you want us all to be women?&quot; Steve asked<br />
&quot;No No,&quot; the newly female David said &quot;It may be a side effect, but I&#39;m not going to force-&quot;<br />
&quot;Then why did you contaminate our water with the magic?&quot; The Wizard said as he sensed the water flowing in the water through the pipes from the furnace. <br />
&quot;Fuck! Everyone don&#39;t do anything with the water!&quot; came a newly deep female voice. Having drapped herself in towels Carl came out her body more slender, but still tall and most of her core strength still there despite some shrinkage in muscles and... other areas. Jeff whistled at the sight of a barely dressed lady <br />
Steve leaned on his new staff and said &quot;Well, I&#39;m glad armor is useless for me. Although maybe I could learn something with that magic aura the minerals have.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can you learn a male version of the spell?&quot; Carl asked<br />
&quot;No, that&#39;s something completely different. But being able to copy a female aura would have it&#39;s uses in reality. I did find some spell scrolls with spells for minor healing I already copied.&quot; Steve added<br />
&quot;Anything else?&quot; Clara asked <br />
&quot;This Archmage is a perv...&quot; Francine said<br />
&quot;Wha?&quot;<br />
&quot;Freedom of movement bikini... Helps me move better as long as I&#39;m only wearing the damn bikini...&quot; Francine said &quot;and now all the guys are turning into girls!&quot;<br />
Carl said &quot;I guess since I&#39;m already a woman, may as well make me some armor and weapons with that stuff Dave!&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; David said &quot;Steven think you can get me a more specific idea of what the mineral can do? I&#39;ve just got regular science to try to figure that out.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d rather not study it too closely, I enjoy being a man and would rather have the antidote of sorts first. Besides I have some magic studying to do.&quot; Steven said as he munched on some fish while transcribing some magic from scroll to book. <br />
&quot;Well girls...&quot; David said &quot;...I guess it should be time for us to take baths and whatnot since we shouldn&#39;t be affected as much by the feminizing magic already being female.&quot;<br />
Carl a bit annoyed said &quot;I&#39;ll go finish mine.&quot; Carl tried to finish her shower quickly. Carl didn&#39;t mentally think of her body as well her body. She had crafted her old one with work, dedication, and living in it and this one... Felt more like he was borrowing the body of a sister he never had. She cleaned her body, but mostly had her eyes closed and tried not to think of the sensations she got from scrubbing certain areas. Due to the modded reality the clothes she put on resized themselves to her body but Carl still didn&#39;t feel comfortable with the way her clothes had resized and the way they sat on her new form. <br />
David&#39;s shower was a little longer. She didn&#39;t have the same hang-ups that Carl did about being in a stranger&#39;s body. It was a strange body but David cleaned it and got to know her body just a little. Then Carla and Francine had their showers which were just regular showers to them. Meanwhile Jeff and Steven were bathing in the river since they didn&#39;t trust the water pumps currently.</p>
