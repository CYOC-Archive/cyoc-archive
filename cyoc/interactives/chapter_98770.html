<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harry&#39;s night had gone fairly well and his parents were fine with his becoming a werefox and were overjoyed to learn he was getting married. They did agree to help set up the small apartment for them to live in, and even agreed to help with the rent and utilities until Harry and Jenny could get things fully under them. It had made him feel well with regard to his folks and for his and Jenny&#39;s future, even with all its issues. Jenny still needed some therapy after being incomplete for so long, and since Harry knew Moon Lake inside and out, having lived there for much of his life, Harry had agreed to drive Jenny to her appointment as he could find Doctor Twist&#39;s clinic faster than Jenny could on his own.<br />
<br />
The biggest issue Harry had had after leaving Jenny&#39;s dorm room was getting notices in to his morning classes and Jenny&#39;s they wouldn&#39;t be in for their eight o&#39;clock classes and might not be in for their nine or even their ten o&#39;clock classes depending on how long Jenny&#39;s therapy session went. It wasn&#39;t too bad for them, as many colleges scheduled there day differently than High Schools did. Some classes were only given once a week, though many of these were held at night. Some were held on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays while others were held on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and they had different times based on the College population. This at times lead to some class periods being blank, and it was this sort of schedule that gave William Anderson the time talk with his wife and show her just how much he missed her during her &quot;girl&#39;s night,&quot; not that that Harry knew that about one of his teacher&#39;s schedules or that William Anderson&#39;s schedule mattered to Harry and Jenny, as not all classes had the numbers to allow for that. Harry had an eight o&#39;clock class and Jenny not only had an eight o&#39;clock class but a nine o&#39;clock class as well.<br />
<br />
Harry had emailed all the teachers that he and Jenny wouldn&#39;t be there with a brief explanation and asked that copies of the day&#39;s notes be given to him, and emailed to Jenny as well. That morning, while his parents cooked breakfast he checked his email and found he had replies and they assured him he and Jenny would get copies of the notes for the day and even recordings of the lectures if they wanted them and that they would get credit for being there to assure both College freshmen that Moon Lake College would try to make up Yvette Smith&#39;s actions. On some level, he didn&#39;t know how if that might be too much, but in the end he wasn&#39;t going to complain. He simply went about his morning, got dressed, had breakfast, and got in his car to drive to the dorm building where Jenny stayed.<br />
<br />
He found the parking lot packed with no open spaces. He pulled into a half circle sort of driveway that was in front of the dorm building. In pure theory he could park there for ten minutes, and he was about to get out and go in to get Jenny when both Jenny and Karen came out from the dormitory building. He did come out to greet them, and found himself in a firm hug from Jenny. It was as if she physically needed him with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry! You&#39;re here!&quot; Jenny smiled as she hugged him and rubbed her head to Harry&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am,&quot; Harry answered as he hugged her back, relishing her scent, and softly rubbed her back as he did so, &quot;I told you I&#39;d be here to take you to your appointment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll stay with me?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I will,&quot; Harry assured her, &quot;I love you. My bond is to you. We&#39;ll be together for a very long time and we&#39;ll have as many little werefoxes as you wish to have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Harry,&quot; Jenny smiled and lovingly hugged him tighter.<br />
<br />
Harry smiled, but looked up to Karen who looked calm, but did seem to know what had caused Jenny to be giving the loving yet desperate hug to him He realized that something had to have happened in the night in order for this. It was a possibility from what he&#39;d been told considering how long Jenny had been incomplete as a possible sign of the therapy that Jenny needed to complete her transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;She had a nightmare last night that you chose Yvette over her,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;or that Yvette took you from her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry hugged Jenny tightly and was soon kissing her forehead and her cheeks as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never go with her and she could never take me,&quot; Harry assured her, &quot;because I love you. I loved you when we were human. How you looked on the outside didn&#39;t matter. It was who you are on the inside that mattered and what I fell in love with. Becoming werefoxes didn&#39;t change that... it only cemented the bonds of love that were between us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny returned the hug, and Harry began to usher her to his car. He opened the passenger door and ushered into the seat. Once she had both legs in he shut the door and prepared to go around the car. Before he did so he turned back to Karen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for telling me,&quot; Harry said to Jenny&#39;s roommate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... I don&#39;t want Jenny hurt or scared any more than you do,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;As a friend and maid of honor... I want you both to have your happy ever after.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry smiled at that, and went around the car to drive Jenny to her appointment. For Karen, it was for the moment the opportunity to look through the handbook and wonder over what kind of were she would be fit to be before her own morning classes. She waved them off as they drove off. Once the car went out of sight, Karen went back in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever met Frances Twist?&quot; Jenny asked as they drove along.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;I&#39;d never met her. I&#39;ve seen her from time to time when Moon Lake&#39;s had major public events... Founders Day and so forth... Beyond that, I only know of her by reputation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it good?&quot; Jenny asked nervously, &quot;she isn&#39;t going to come at me? Is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She won&#39;t attack you, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking,&quot; Harry assured her, &quot;and she&#39;s been a therapist here fore awhile. I doubt she&#39;s been a bad one... no one&#39;s complained... that I&#39;ve noticed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny breathed some relief at that, as she looked out the windshield of the car to see the sign for the therapy clinic that had the same name as on the card that Samantha had given her before hearing the day before. Harry pulled around and brought the car into a small parking space that was right in front of the clinic and was between two other cars. When he got to helping Jenny out of the car he did his best to give her a gentlemanly smile and let her take one of his hands in hers. In doing so, he noticed that her hand was trembling slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen... you don&#39;t have to be afraid,&quot; Harry assured her, &quot;this is to help you and that is Mrs. Twists only goal for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... but...&quot; Jenny began, &quot;every were here... every female is so... well built, if you know what I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are the only one for me,&quot; Harry answered, his bond to Jenny going into overdrive.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if they don&#39;t realize that?&quot; Jenny asked back, &quot;what if they decide to flaunt themselves and come after you? What if they don&#39;t take &quot;no&quot; for an answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure that Frances Twist is a lesbian,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;as a male werefox, I am rather appealing to the eye... but that really won&#39;t do anything for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
That, however, did not have the reaction Harry was looking for.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what if she puts the moves on ME?&quot; Jenny asked, her hand trembling even more as they stepped onto the curb in front of Frances&#39; clinic.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s happily married,&quot; Harry assured her, &quot;and while were libidos do have the tendency to lead to rather open marriages in some cases... until this incident with Yvette... I&#39;ve never heard of weres engaging in such behavior during my lifetime where they&#39;d force themselves on someone else. She wouldn&#39;t force herself on you unless you ask for it, literally, and only if Samantha Twist okays it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny&#39;s eyes flashed red at the mention of Yvette&#39;s name for a moment. Harry was about to shield her eyes from view, as they were in public, but thankfully it didn&#39;t last long and Jenny&#39;s eyes returned to their normal color.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, Jen,&quot; Harry said to her, &quot;remember the rules. We&#39;re in public right now. By law we can&#39;t change during the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know...&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;but she makes me so angry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;Yvette did a lot to you...&quot;<br />
<br />
He then reached for the door and opened it to let Jenny in. He smiled to her as they went into the clinic.<br />
<br />
&quot;...but that is why we&#39;re here,&quot; Harry finished and followed Jenny in.</p>
