<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ed but you can&#39;t stay a baby for today.&quot; Dawn said while she used the computer in her bedroom to turn her brother back to his original age.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the living room, Timmy was playing bumper cars with Hector&#39;s baby walkers. Both, Hector and Edwin were crying all the time, even stronger when their walker bumped into each other. Timmy was wickedly laughing all along.<br />
<br />
Everybody was so distracted that no one noticed that Edwin was growing back until he felt that his legs were so long for the baby walker. He immediately realized that he was getting older, but he was still naked! As a baby he didn&#39;t care too much about being naked in front of his cousin, but it won&#39;t be the same when his pubes began to sprout back!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!!&quot; Timmy yelled when he saw that Edwin left the room, but it was too fast that he didn&#39;t realize that his cousin was getting bigger. Nevertheless, he ran after him.<br />
<br />
Edwin didn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, so his first thought was going to Dawn&#39;s room. He ran through his house butt naked, only covering his growing privates behind his hands. When he arrived into his sister&#39;s room, he was immediately caught by Timmy who jumped over him making them fall to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Edwin, you&#39;re big again!&quot; Timmy said a little disappointed while he stared at his 16 years old cousin&#39;s exposed back. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to be big, I want to be the biggest boy in house!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help you with that!&quot; Dawn said before she used her computer again to scan Timmy and get his profile. When all his data was on display, she looked for his age label and then she changed it from 7 to 16, the same age of Edwin. &quot;It&#39;s done!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dawn, why did you do that?!!&quot; Edwin shouted while his little cousin was still sitting on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do what?&quot; Timmy asked. &quot;I feel kinda funny.&quot; He can&#39;t figure out he was growing bigger. &quot;Edwin, give me a piggy back ride!&quot; He began to jump on Edwin&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch!&quot; Edwin groaned because he was feeling how his cousin was getting heavier with age. Now, the 7 years old kid had grown 3 years and his clothes were beginning to tear.<br />
<br />
&quot;My clothes felt tight!&quot; Timmy whined a second before his shoes bursted out exposing his toes which he wiggled in relief. &quot;Woah, what&#39;s happening? Am I growing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you&#39;re.&quot; Dawn replied with a grin in her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;CoOl!&quot; Timmy replied in clearly deepening cracking voice. &quot;I feel stronger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And heavier!&quot; Edwin complained while he bore the weight of a 13 years old preteen boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you liked it, because now it&#39;s when puberty comes on!&quot; Dawn grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Puber-what?&quot; Timmy asked in voice similar to Edwin, but he stopped wondering when he saw that his clothing was giving up. &quot;Oh no, my clothes!&quot;<br />
<br />
When his shirt ripped off a broad strong back was exposed, even stronger than the one he was sitting on. His shoulders and arms had grown bigger as well and now Timmy looked like a real life Johnny Bravo.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m strong!&quot; Timmy cheered while he flexed his newly grown muscles, but he saw that not just muscles had grown on him. &quot;What&#39;s this? Ewww! It&#39;s hair!!&quot; He yelled when he noticed his new hairy armpits. &quot;Dawn, take it off! Take it off! I don&#39;t like it!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Are you afraid of a little of hair?&quot; Edwin mocked at him while he showed off his own armpits. &quot;Big boys have hair in their armpits aaaand...!&quot; He pushed Timmy off him while he took his tight shorts off. &quot;You don&#39;t have hair just in there!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAAAHH!!&quot; Timmy gasped when he saw how hairy his legs had got but even more impressive to him was the thick bush of pubic hair that had outgrown over his privates. As a kid in mind that he was it&#39;s a really shocking moment for him. &quot;AAAAAH! I just wanted to be bigger! Why I have too much hair in my body?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dawn stared at freaked out teenager who can&#39;t move while he self discovered his own body. She helped her brother to stand up and blushed a little when she noticed that he was naked. &quot;I&#39;d had enough of naked guys for today. Can you put on something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course.&quot; Edwin blushed ashamed while he covered his dick with his hands. &quot;Tim, come with me. You&#39;ll need clothes too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you&#39;re taller than Ed.&quot; Dawn told Timmy while she watched them leaving her room. &quot;Hector! He&#39;s alone!!&quot; She ran to  the living room as fast as she can, however when he crossed next to Edwin&#39;s room and saw the two guys putting on some boxers she thought for the first time that they looked really hot and immediately got an idea.<br />
<br />
Baby Hector was watching TV when she took him in her arms and returned to her room. Then, she left him on her bed while she used the Chronivac on him. When his data began to display on screen, she stared at the age label before she decided if she do what she thought or not.</p>
