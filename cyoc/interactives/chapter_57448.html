<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, I am curious as to the sort of man you would grow into - so <br />
while you're transfixed by my wand, I'm going to age you to 25 years <br />
and see how you would have developed,&quot; Kat said making small <br />
concentric circular motion with her wand.  <br />
<br />
It reminded Dan of the motion of a clock only faster. He watched as <br />
Kat and her room seemed to grow smaller. He sobbed as his shoes became <br />
excruciatingly tight until they finally ripped.  Then he sighed with <br />
relief as his toes tore through his socks. He could feel cold air on <br />
his belly. The button on the top of his jeans popped off and flew <br />
across the room just missing Kat. Dan could hear his seams splitting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you were due for a growth spurt,&quot; Kat says with a laugh, <br />
&quot;Clothing begone!&quot; She waves her wand. <br />
<br />
Dan swallows hard.  He's totally naked and for the first time he's got <br />
hair on his chest, but he's the prisoner of his 18 year old witch <br />
sister.  Kat wheels over her full length mirror. Dan's eyes widen and <br />
he smiles.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You just admire yourself while I decide what to do to you,&quot; Kat says <br />
as she throws herself on her bed and picks up her cell phone.<br />
<br />
She speed dials somebody.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Keith, it's Kat.  Yeah, I expect to see you at my birthday party <br />
tonight, but I'm not calling about that - at least not exactly.  I was <br />
calling about that 4H project you wanted to do with me,&quot; she says with <br />
a grin, then she looks over her shoulder at Dan.<br />
<br />
Dan is immobile and unable to speak, but his face shows consternation <br />
at her words. He thinks &quot;4H Project&quot;?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you've already got the bull.  Well, what would you say if I could <br />
manage to get us a cow?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan furtively shakes his head as much as Kat's spell will allow.<br />
<br />
Kat just grins evilly at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, huh.  Yes, Keith, you've got a Jersey bull lined up, and I can <br />
guarantee a fertile Jersey cow,&quot; Kat said pointing her wand at Dan <br />
again.<br />
<br />
Dan was shaking violently no, but Kat didn't care.  Her 4 H breeding <br />
project with Keith would guarantee her hours alone with the hunky 19 <br />
year old. Dan could feel his body tingling.  Particularly, his now <br />
hairy pecs seemed to be swelling up. His nipples tingled.  He was <br />
growing hairy breasts?  No, the nipples split and started to elongate.  <br />
Udders? He swallowed hard as he felt his swelling pecs slowly descend <br />
down his torso.  He could already feel his empty scrotum between his <br />
thighs as his balls started feverishly burrowing up through his flesh.<br />
<br />
Dan's mind raced back to Bio class.  The cells that gave rise to <br />
testes started out on top of the kidneys and migrated downward.  There <br />
were different sets: one could become ovaries, the other pair became <br />
testes.  His testes were shrinking as the migrated back toward his <br />
kidneys. Dan wished he could scream.  He felt his dick pulling back <br />
into his body, and his hips pushing apart to make room for his new <br />
female parts. He felt his penis opening and splitting. Kat cannot do <br />
this to me, Dan thought desperately, I'm her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, someone gave me a Jersey cow as a birthday gift.  I'm looking at <br />
it right now.  It looks just like that Borden's cow Elsie, the one on <br />
the tins at the school cafeteria,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Dan looked at her doe eyed as he toppled forward on his hooves.  He <br />
could feel his heavy udder wobble beneath him. He glared at Kat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need a barn?  We have an old stable in back, it will probably <br />
need a little fixing up, but I bet you could do that, Keith,&quot; Kat said <br />
with a scheming grin.  Dan was going to work out better than she'd <br />
hoped.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many times do you think they'll need to mate?&quot; Kat asked eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; she said with disappointment, &quot;They're the most successful <br />
mating breed and almost always get pregnant on the first try. Still we <br />
should make sure.  Right, okay, I'll meet you down back by the stables <br />
with my cow and you bring your bull. Then we can get the project <br />
started before my birthday party! L-goodbye, Keith,&quot; Kat said with <br />
renewed eagerness, &quot;See you soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hung up her cell phone and hopped out of bed. &quot;Come on, Danielle, <br />
you got a date with a bull named Ferdinand! Oh, you need a rope,&quot; Kat <br />
said drawing a circle with her wand.  A rope appeared around Dan's <br />
neck, and she grabbed the lead.<br />
<br />
Dan was feeling surprisingly docile.  He wasn't sure if it was his new <br />
gender or his new species.  Probably it was both.  He had been in 4H <br />
too, and recalled that Jersey cows were inherently docile in nature. <br />
He followed Kat out of her room and down the hall, but he froze in <br />
terror at the top of the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on you stupid cow!&quot; ordered Kat. Then she looked at the stairs <br />
and at Dan's new form. &quot;Stupid me, I should have changed you out at <br />
the stables. Wait, I'm a witch,&quot; Kat said slapping her head. &quot;By the <br />
powers that be transport me and my beast to the backyard!&quot; she shouted <br />
waving her wand in the air.<br />
<br />
The hallway and staircase shifted.  Colors ran together. They were <br />
spinning in a maelstrom of distorted shapes and colors.  Twisted trees <br />
and buildings whirled by them, and suddenly it all stopped.  They were <br />
standing in the backyard.  Dan felt nauseous.  He felt something <br />
coming up. Only when he tasted it in his mouth did he start chewing.  <br />
He wasn't sick, he was just chewing his cud.  As a bovine, he had a <br />
four part stomach.   The grass and grain he ate would be processed and <br />
come back up to be chewed as cud before being swallowed and going into <br />
the next stomach in his new digestive system. He wagged his tail, and <br />
wondered what Kat would do about the stables.  They had burned down <br />
when he was 8.  Dan knew that with certainty as he had been playing <br />
with matches at the time. Matches that Kat had given him.  He wanted <br />
to glare at her, but in his current state he could only glance at her <br />
with moderate disinterest.<br />
<br />
Kat laughed, &quot;You certainly make a better cow than a brother.  Though <br />
you were more of a stud than I expected.  I wonder if I should have <br />
made you younger before turning you into a cow. What's 25 in cow <br />
years? Maybe 1 or 2 years?&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Keith will be here soon, <br />
I'd better get that stable rebuilt. By the moon rising in the east, I <br />
beseech the keepers of time to turn back the clock 9 years to when the <br />
stable stood here!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a sudden wind. Then a sudden deathly chilled stillness. <br />
Lightning flashed, thunder crashed.  The stable rose from its ashes. <br />
Kat and Dan stared in amazement as the blackened beams rose from the <br />
ground. They glowed red with dying embers, but the embers burst into <br />
flames and the flames faded to restore the formerly charred wood to <br />
its uncharred state.  It took nearly 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mooooo!&quot; lowed Dan in amazement.<br />
<br />
The dilapidated stable again stood as it had been 9 years earlier.<br />
<br />
The sound of a truck coming down the gravel drive announced Keith's <br />
arrival.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a moment too soon,&quot; said Kat excitedly.<br />
<br />
The truck pulled up nearby with a red metal trailer in tow. Keith <br />
jumped out of the driver's cab door, and his buddy Raleigh jumped out <br />
of the passenger door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you brought Rolly?&quot; Kat asked as she glared at the unwanted <br />
interloper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, he got the bull,&quot; Keith explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's Danielle, let's introduce her to Bright Eyes and start them <br />
breeding,&quot; Kat said.<br />
<br />
Raleigh strode proudly to the back of  the trailer and opened the door <br />
to the trailer.  He disappeared inside, and came out leading a fine <br />
looking muscled animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me introduce you to Bright Eyes, a blue ribbon winning Jersey <br />
Steer,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steer? You said he was a bull?&quot; Keith said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steers are bulls,&quot; Raleigh replied.<br />
<br />
Kat rolled her eyes, &quot;Steers were bulls, stupid.  They become steers <br />
when you castrate them!&quot; <br />
<br />
All three of them moved to the male beast's nether regions to confirm <br />
that it was in fact castrated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man, I'm sorry. If there's any way I can make up for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat suddenly looked up brightly at Raleigh. She said, &quot;Yes, yes, I <br />
think there is. You were always buddies with my kid brother Danny <br />
right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes? Dan and I- uh, what's the matter with Keith?  He's like <br />
he's frozen bent over looking at Bright Eyes' cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Rolly, that's because he's frozen in time and space. You'll <br />
notice your watch isn't ticking.  That's because I'm a witch.  <br />
Danielle used to be Danny.  And you will soon be our new bull Rollo!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Moo?&quot; gasped Raleigh raising a hoof to his mouth in terror.  He was <br />
turning into a bull.  His clothing ripped to shreds on him as he went <br />
from 150lbs to 1200lbs in less than a minute. Kat that crazy bitch was <br />
a witch!  He stared at Danielle realizing that it was in fact Dan. He <br />
also felt his new bull size balls swelling as her bovine scent reached <br />
him.  Dan was sure one hot cow. Raleigh licked his lips and dropped to <br />
all fours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what am I going to tell Keith?&quot; Kat asked herself in <br />
exasperation.<br />
<br />
She walked over to Keith, and bent his body upright. Then she <br />
awkwardly carried him like a mannequin over to the stables. She looked <br />
back at Danielle, Rollo and Bright Eyes grazing together behind them. <br />
Then she started time again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you think about the stables?&quot; Kat asked.<br />
<br />
Keith blinked.  He had been bent over looking at the steer's missing <br />
scrotum, now he was upright looking at the dilapidated stables. He <br />
swallowed, &quot;Blood rush,&quot; he muttered, &quot;Not sure about the stables <br />
until we get a bull, Katherine.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kat turned him around by his shoulders, &quot;Rolly and his sick sense of <br />
humor.  He brought Bright Eyes the steer and Rollo the bull.  You did <br />
look pretty shocked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Raleigh?  Where is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He went home I guess.  He was embarrassed about how unfunny his joke <br />
was. So what do think about the stables will it work for our breeding <br />
experiment?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, oh, yeah!&quot; Keith said with a grin, &quot;Now that we have a bull and <br />
cow, this should do fine.  I'll nail up some of those loose boards and <br />
white wash the building and sweep out the spiders.  I'd better get <br />
right to work.  I'll phone Raleigh to get some paint, lumber and <br />
nails.  I've got a hammer and saw in my truck's tool box. Maybe you <br />
could get some trash bags. I'll start cleaning it up as I call <br />
Raleigh.  But first I'll make a rope fence to keep our cattle from <br />
wandering off.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Keith grabbed a coil of rope from the back of his truck and made a <br />
rough corral using trees to fence in the three bovines with his nylon <br />
cord. When he took out his cell phone, Kat grabbed it from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You cannot get a signal down here.  I'll take it up to the house and <br />
call Rolly for you. You get to work cleaning if you want to have time <br />
to get yourself cleaned up before my party.<br />
<br />
Dan lowed softly as he looked at Raleigh.  Damn, he certainly made one <br />
handsome bull.</p>
