<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">**Shit is getting pretty intense - bj88<br />
<br />
The craziness behind them, the pack got on with the night (which was one everyone would remember for a long time). Eric felt guilty about Julie, but tried not to let that damper his mood. Nate, still transformed since his clothing was pretty much destroyed when he shifted to grab Julie, came up to his brother after Eric finished his exchange of words with Austin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay? Not having second thoughts are you?&quot; he asked. His mother was close behind him with Samantha, in case Eric needed any additional comforting. <br />
<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;m just, I dunno know, frustrated about the stuff with Julie. I&#39;m still going to do this, I NEED to, but I hate how unhappy this is making her.&quot; Eric sighed.<br />
<br />
“I know buddy, I know. But you can worry about her tomorrow. Right now, this is YOUR moment. Don’t let Julie’s lack of judgement ruin this.” Nate said, only just holding back the growl in his throat. <br />
<br />
He was as angry as one could be at Julie for trying to attack his brother. Nate had a hard time believing that someone in love would behave the way she did. <br />
<br />
“Nervous?” Samantha asked, knowing that one’s first change was a very stressful moment. And poor Eric’s was only made worse with Julie’s interruption. <br />
<br />
“You could say that.” Eric said.<br />
<br />
“You’ll be fine. I love you, and Nate will look out for you tonight, won’t you?” Martha said, looking at her elder son.<br />
<br />
“Uh ya.” Nate said, not wanting his brother to feel weirded out. They’d all end up having sex at some point, he didn’t want his brother to think he’d be “watching” him the entire time. But the comment went right over Eric’s head as he saw two figures approaching him. <br />
<br />
Ben walked up to the two of them, with an obviously shy, dark haired girl. She was about the same height as Eric. Her chin length hair was done in a way that made it look messy. Or maybe it really was messy. She kept darting her hazel eyes to the ground, up to Eric, and quickly back to the ground. <br />
<br />
“Eric, Cassie. Cassie, Eric.” Ben said. <br />
<br />
“Hi.” Both teenagers awkwardly said at the same time. <br />
<br />
Nate stifled a laugh, and left with Ben, who encouraged the two to just have fun. Martha kissed Eric’s cheek, and left with Samantha. Which left Eric alone with Cassie. Eric didn’t recognize her, though she was probably his age, give or take a year. <br />
<br />
“So um… do you wanna go?” she asked, making a small gesture to the forest behind her.<br />
<br />
“Uh, ya.” Eric said, grabbing his backpack. <br />
<br />
He followed Cassie into the woods, more nervous than he’d ever been. Mostly about having sex. He’d considered the alternative, just getting scratched or something. But he’d still have to do it with the person who turned him. <br />
<br />
Cassie stopped once she reached a fallen tree. She sat on it, and waited for Eric to do the same. Neither were sure how to start this. <br />
<br />
“Um… was that your girlfriend earlier?” Cassie asked.<br />
<br />
“You mean Julie? I guess. We never made it official. Now that I think of it we never even had a proper date. Stuff got in the way.” Eric said, drooping his head as he realized he’d brought the conversation to his dead father. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry about your dad.” Cassie said.<br />
<br />
“I know. Everyone is.” Eric muttered. He forgot Cassie could hear him, and quickly started to apologize, knowing how his words must have sounded to her. But she was surprisingly understanding. <br />
<br />
“It’s okay Eric. I get it. My father died three years ago.”<br />
<br />
“I… I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Ya. It was some stupid drunk driver. Clipped the back of his car, and then he rolled into a power line.” Cassie said in a small voice. Now Eric felt twice as bad. <br />
<br />
“I remember how it felt, right after he died. If it makes you feel any better my boyfriend broke up with me too.”<br />
<br />
“He did?”<br />
<br />
“He strung me along for like five months before finally dumping me over the phone. Can you believe that? What a dick move.” Cassie laughed hollowly. <br />
<br />
“Kinda like Julie trying to jump me.” Eric said. The two laughed, and continued to chat, releasing most if not all the nervous energy they had. <br />
<br />
“I don’t think I’ve seen you in school before.” Eric commented. <br />
<br />
“I’ve seen you. I’m not in any of your classes, but we’re in the same grade.” Cassie said. <br />
<br />
“Oh geez, I feel pretty stupid now.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t, the school’s packed tighter than a can of sardines. It’s a wonder you can see your own arms stretched out in front of you.”<br />
<br />
Maybe, but I’d still like to think I’d remember seeing someone like you.” Eric said, not realizing what he said until the words left his mouth. Cassie blushed, and muttered a thank you. Eric blushed to, and the air between them suddenly became very, VERY thick. <br />
<br />
Eric and Cassie both leaned in at the same time to kiss each other. Eric felt ever nerve of his body light up as he started moving from Cassie’s lips to her neck. And then lower and lower. He’d never done this before, but from the way he was moving, you’d never know it. <br />
<br />
With one hand, he pulled Cassie closer to him, while the other slipped under her breath and started to massage them. Cassie bit her lip and held in the moan she felt building inside her. She moved her own hands to Eric’s back, and pulled his shirt off. Then did the same with her own clothing. <br />
<br />
Eric took a moment to admire her naked body, and felt his penis stiffen. In their normal forms, both teenagers were rather average. Even though Cassie was a werewolf, she looked any girl who had yet to hit her growth spurt. Reasonably endowed, but nothing like some of her peers. And Eric was still enjoying the awkward stage of gangly youth. He was a little embarrassed at the size of his equipment, which was about five inches or so hard. <br />
<br />
Cassie smiled, and kissed him again. Eric fell back against the ground as she put her full weight against him and started to change. Her ears grew to points, and then moved up to the back of her head, which slowly changed into a lupine muzzle. Dark grey and black hairs started to grow over her arms, and then spread over the rest of Cassie’s body. Her undercoat was much lighter though, the color of sand and hay. It wasn’t a common fur coloring, at least around Moon Lake. <br />
<br />
Sharp clawed hands gently ran down Eric’s back. Eric shuddered at her new touch, his eyes almost rolling back into his head. Instead he shut then, and leaned in to kiss Cassie again. They both kicked off their sneakers, with Cassie stretching paws after she did. Her golden eyes shined in the moonlight, and as her tail grew, she lowered herself on Eric’s incredibly hard penis.<br />
<br />
Eric moaned this time, as she started rhythmically moving back and forth. He didn’t mind that she was doing most of the leg work (so to speak). Eric was too lost in the moment of passion. His hands went up and found her larger, furred breast. It only took a few pinches for Cassie to come, and in turn Eric. She slide off him, and smiled at him. <br />
<br />
With some difficulty (mostly because his entire body was still in “shock” from the orgasm) Eric sat up to stare at the she-wolf beside him. They each had a decent amount of each other’s fluid on their bodies. Eric smiled back at Cassie when he felt the warmth Nate said would come after they finished. <br />
<br />
Cassie remained silent (though she had a huge grin on her face) while Eric marveled at his changing body. Similar dark hairs started growing all over his body, which was quickly gaining mass and muscle. His tail explodes from his backside, as does his new rocket. It’s at least doubled in size, and a furry sheath runs up half of the length. <br />
<br />
“Grrr.” Eric groans as his face pushed out into a distinctly canine muzzle. His new ears twitch in the wind, and pick up new sounds. Black claws erupt from the ends of his hands (now paws), and he grips Cassie’s back tighter. She winces when he claws start to dig into her skin, but the pain is easily remedied by the intense stare the new werewolf is giving her.<br />
<br />
“Go on Eric, just do what feels natural.” she whispers. Eric lowers himself and starts lapping at Cassie’s wet slit with his new tongue. His tastebuds are much more sensitive now. He wasn’t expecting to have such a great reaction. Eric quickly flips Cassie over and drives his rocket home.<br />
<br />
A few powerful thrusts later, and Eric comes. Take shaking breathes, he tilts his head back and lets loose his first howl. The rest of the pack soon joined in, and started to convene where the two were lying. <br />
<br />
“Holy crap.” Eric said, looking down at himself. His fur was much lighter than Cassie’s. Silver and gray, and under the night sky almost blue. His muzzle was a lighter brown color, before it met the dark gray fur over his eyes and ears. Eric flexed his paws a few times before smiling at Cassie. <br />
<br />
“Thank you.” he said. Cassie returned his elated smile, and kissed him in return.<br />
<br />
“My pleasure. Now why don’t we continue…”<br />
<br />
Her sentence was cut off by a spine tingling scream. Eric couldn’t tell whose it was, only that it was a female, and coming from the direction of where he knew the others were. Eric suddenly felt a rush of adrenaline, and he raced back towards the cars. Nate, Ben, Alex, Cassie and Austin were close behind him. <br />
<br />
They all felt something drop into their stomachs when they heard Melissa Stovall screaming that Julie wasn’t breathing.</p>
