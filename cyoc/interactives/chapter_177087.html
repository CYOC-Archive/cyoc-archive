<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex spent a good deal of the morning walking along the road. With his newfound strength and stamina courtesy of Roc and Bo he actually found it to be quite easy and relaxing. The trousers and boots he had borrowed from the farmer&#39;s son even fit well and were well broken in and comfortable. He was just about considering finding a shady place to sit down for lunch when he saw a cart on the side of the road ahead.<br />
<br />
As Alex neared he say it wasn&#39;t a simple farm cart, the wood was polished and carved with intricate patterns of leaves and vines, loaded into the cart were several barrels and even those seem well made by a craftsman&#39;s hand, and the man standing next to the cart was probably one of the most beautiful Alex had ever seen. Not handsome. Beautiful. His features were delicate and vulpine, had long flowing golden hair, and he wore a diaphanous shirt and and slim trousers that showed off a slim and lean physique. It took Alex a moment to notice the man&#39;s ears which came to slender points. He&#39;d bet anything this man was an elf.<br />
<br />
Even his scowl was pretty, and he was directing the scowl right at the front of the cart where lay an empty harness where some sort of animal should have been drawing the cart. The man&#39;s ears gave a slight twitch and he turned to regard Alex, the scowl lessening for a moment as Alex felt himself being thoroughly looked over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, a fellow traveler, I hope. Not a bandit to relieve me of my wares as I lay stranded.&quot; The elf&#39;s voice was almost musical, making him sound like he was just on the verge of singing every word. Alex felt like a clumsy oaf just standing next to him.<br />
<br />
Alex held up his hands, showing he had no weapon on him. &quot;Just a traveler. Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously.&quot; The elf said with a hint of distaste and sarcasm. &quot;A wolf came out of the woods and spooked my horse. One of the bindings on the harness gave way and he bolted into the woods with the wolf nipping at his hooves. Pity, he was of fine pedigree but where there&#39;s one wolf there&#39;s many. He&#39;s probably the pack&#39;s lunch by now. I need to get my wares to Dicktin by sun fall and here I am, stranded.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex suddenly felt the need to help the stranded elf. He couldn&#39;t explain it, it was as if every fiber of his being wanted to help. He looked at the cart and walked over. He grabbed one of the shafts connected to the harness and gave it an experimental lift. It was heavy, and while he could lift it he doubted he could drag it to town. &quot;I&#39;m not sure I could.&quot;<br />
<br />
The elf circled Alex, delicate nose wrinkling a bit but still looking him up and down. &quot;You&#39;re a strong one, and I detect some magic on you making you stronger than you should be. I think I have a little magic I could use on you to give you more than enough strength to pull my cart.&quot;<br />
<br />
The elf smelled of sweet flowers and spice. In was one of the most intoxicating aromas Alex had ever come across. He must smell like a sweaty pig next to this elf. No wonder he was wrinkling his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me human, what is your name.&quot; The elf came to a stop in front of him, gently resting fingertips on Alex&#39;s muscular chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex.&quot; He answered. The fingers were warm and soft, he felt himself melting under the touch, heat moving into his brain. It was getting harder and harder to think.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well met, Alex. I am Lyonus. Tell me, sweet Alex. Will you help me get my cart to town?&quot; Lyonus&#39; eyes where a brilliant shade of green, and Alex found himself staring into them, unable to look away.<br />
<br />
He nodded slowly. &quot;I.. if I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent.&quot; The elf stepped back and a blue glow surrounded his hands. He wove intricate patterns in the air, speaking in a song like tongue Alex couldn&#39;t understand. There was a faint voice in the back of his head, telling him to run, to get away. But something kept him where he was. Why should he run from Lyonus? He had to help.<br />
<br />
The blue light struck him in the center of the chest and he cried out as it felt like molten fire was suddenly rushing through his bones. He felt like he was bursting apart from the inside as he fell to his knees. There came a sudden ripping noise and Alex feared his skin had torn open, but looking down he noticed with only the faintest of relief that it was his pants splitting at every seam.<br />
<br />
The scraps of cloth fell away revealing heavily muscled thighs, but even more surprising was the size of his cock. It had already stretched outward a few more inches and was growing thicker as well. &quot;What..&quot; Pain wracked his body as he looked at the elf. &quot;What.. are..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t talk.&quot; Lyonus said with a toothy smile. &quot;Let the magic work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s cock continued to grow, though it began to take on a strange shape. The mushroom head of his cock flattened out, turning into a flared tip, the pink skin darkening to an ebony black. Veins pulsed along the whole length  as a ring formed along the shaft near the middle. Alex could feel his balls suddenly laying in the dusty road between his burning thighs, the skin also black but the pair of them swollen to an obscene size. He was firmly erect, the molt pain flooding his body mixing with an odd pleasure deep in his groin.<br />
<br />
His body hair suddenly turned from brown to a dark gray, the hairs losing their curl as they became straight and rough. They also started spreading, filling in to completely cover his pecs and abs, arms and legs. He could even feel them growing over his ass and back, he could feel the hair on his head sticking up, a line of coarse bristles growing in a wide stripe over his skull and down between his shoulder blades.<br />
<br />
Pain seared through his skull and Alex put his hands up to his head, just in time to feel his ears growing longer and shifting along his skull, their tops stretching upwards as the spreading hair covered them in a soft fuzz. A twitch in his spine sent him toppling forward, he barely managed to catch himself with his hands, nails digging into the dirt road as his body twitched and spasmed. His cock was so long that looking down he could see the head of it right beneath his eyes, twitching and drooling pre into the dusty ground.<br />
<br />
He tried to push himself to his feet, but a sudden cramping in his toes sent him to the ground again. He looked back to see all but his middle toe shrinking away as the remaining tow swelled, the nail turning hard and black like a.. like a hoof. It all came crashing home, he tried to push himself up again, gritting his teeth as he felt his face pushing outwards. &quot;No.. I.. haaaww...&quot; The bray chilled him to his core, even as the heat of the magic spell continued to rush through him.<br />
<br />
His cock left his field of vision, but not because it was getting smaller, but because he was growing larger. His chest barreling outwards, his muscles taking on new shapes as they grew stronger. His shoulders twisted into a new position, locking his arms downwards as his fingers started following the same pattern as his toes, all melting away except for the one that became a large black hoof.<br />
<br />
He felt a churning between his legs and let out a loud bray as his equine cock suddenly unloaded with load after load of musky, cream colored spunk that fell on the ground in front of him in long ribbons. It felt like the last of his humanity leaving his body. He was panting heavily, trying to catch his breath, cock retreating into the sheath on his stomach, as he noticed Lyonus approaching. He pulled back his lips, threatening to bite, and then the smell of flowers and spices filled his nostrils again and he felt his mind calming, trusting this elf.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a good donkey. Alas but could I do this to more of you humans, always making asses of yourselves anyway. But then who would I trade with.&quot; The elf chuckled. &quot;Stand up, let me attach the harness.&quot; He reached down an picked up the coin pouch given to Alex by Rick and peered inside. &quot;Poor traveler indeed.&quot; Then the elf tied it to his belt.<br />
<br />
Alex slowly obeyed the order to stand. He could still think, he knew he was still himself on the inside, but the elf was using some sort of magic on him beyond what he used to transform him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such a good beast. Behave yourself and help me get my wares into town and I&#39;ll make sure you&#39;re back on your own two legs at the end of this. You have my oath.&quot; Alex eyes the elf as he felt the bridle going on over his head. There wasn&#39;t really much he could do to argue. The elf did one check to make sure everything was secure, climbed into the driver&#39;s seat of the wagon, and gave the reins a little snap.<br />
<br />
What had he done to deserve this? Alex wondered, but all he had to go on now was the elf&#39;s promise to restore him so he began to walk, the heavy weight of the wagon now rolling along behind him.</p>
