<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly, consciousness returned to Leopold and grunting, he blinked and thought, &quot;What the hell,&quot; as he realised that not only had the pain that had knocked him out had dissipated, but also that he for some reason had an understanding and deeper knowledge about the creature he was keeping in the crawlspace. Such information, Leopold suddenly understood, that only a person close to the creature, such as a friend or really close friend, would have.<br />
<br />
Grunting, he tried to stand, but flopped back into the chair when it came to him quite suddenly that his balance had shifted and looking down, he muttered, &quot;What the hell,&quot; but stopped saying anything else when it came to him that his voice sounded different.<br />
<br />
Still looking down at his torso, which looked at the same time like it was pushed out but also wasted away, he wondered what had happened, unable to fathom why he suddenly knew that the creature had a name and it was Annabeth and was indeed thirteen years of age. Completely lost as to how he knew that this creature only wore dresses, liked classic rock and had a dear friend named Josie, who had nearly inseparable from Annabeth since the two had met in second grade.<br />
<br />
Gingerly, Leopold touched the upper half of his chest and immediately uttered a strangled gasp as he drew his hand away. Leaping out of the chair, he tore at his shirt in a wild and desperate matter, suddenly feeling disgusted at wearing what his mind was calling &quot;old man clothes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tossing the shirt aside, he gasped out again, making another strangled noise at he stared in disbelief at the swelling that his mind was telling him was two, A cup size breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not possible,&quot; Leopold thought as he cupped his nearly formed breasts, even though his mind was telling him that these growths had been happening since he had been about ten years old, perfectly nature for a girl nature for a girl entering puberty.<br />
<br />
Shifting his hand lower, he whimpered a cry when he felt nothing but flat skin, but then uttered a third strangled cry when his mind relinquished the memory that he did in fact have a penis, complete with a set of testicles attached to the base of the shaft, and that this growth was down between his legs, encased in a sort of sheath. Had a set of genitals like this since he had been born, but had been raised as a girl, like his parents thought and he had told him he had wanted when he had been about five or six.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn't make sense,&quot; Leopold thought as he shrugged off his pants and kicking them away, he headed across the apartment and toward the bathroom, entering the wrong room twice as he first went into a bedroom that should have looked familiar, but wasn't and what appeared to be a walk in closet before finally locating the toilet.<br />
<br />
Fumbling for the light, Leopold, whose mind was slowly forcing him to think of himself as Annabeth, turned and peered into the dirty mirror when he finally had it switched on. Looking back at him was the creature that he knew that he had bound, but was at a lost as to how he could be also sharing the same body. Running a hand over his now soft skin, avoiding touching the swell of his chest, Leopold squatted down as a new thought came to mind and applying his hand between his legs, he gently pressed until a the pink shaft of what he knew to be his penis was partially exposed, pointing an angle so that it was aimed back and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no,&quot; he cried out in his feminine voice and standing, his penis sliding back into the protective sheath, he thought about how some doctor had said it was an undeveloped set of genitals, Leopold turned away from the mirror and without turning off the light, rushed out of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Returning to the main room, he looked at the clothes he had shed and then dress next to the chair and thought that he had to get dressed, but shivered as he felt himself drawn to the dress and wanting to put it on, but also thinking about dressing back in what he was viewing more and more as &quot;old man clothes&quot;. Puzzling over which would really be appropriate, Leopold suddenly had another thought and heading for the hidden area in the closet, he peered in at the creature, figuring that it either was it or the amulet the teenage had disposed up that had transformed him.<br />
<br />
A feeling of being off centre caused him to look away and still thinking, he searched his newly forming memories of Annabeth before coming to the conclusion that the creature had not done this and that maybe it was the amulet, therefore allowing him to take the creature's life, which Leopold could not clarify if it was wasting that life or he was wasting his life.<br />
<br />
Confused, he glanced back at the creature, noted that it was still asleep and entering the hidden room, he forcibly pulled off what he was thinking of as his underwear, upset to see that the creature clearly had the same genital set-up as he now had. Returning to the main room, he glanced at the clothes had been wearing when he woke up, decided that there was no way he was going back to wearing those clothes and picking up the dress, he pulled on the underwear, upset that he clearly felt comfortable wearing girl's panties, and shrugging on the dress, he began searching about for the amulet, sure that it had still been around his neck before the pains had caused him to delve into the unconscious.<br />
<br />
After a moment, he located the amulet, but noting that it was touching the pants leg of his former clothes, he hesitated about touching it, not really liking the idea of going back to being Leopold Rogers. After a moment, he kicked the clothes away and picking up the amulet, he started to formulate an idea of what to do with the creature and keep himself in the current position he currently found himself in.<br />
<br />
Heading into the kitchen area, he searched about the drawers until he had found the gloves he had taken from some hospital he been admitted to when he had been younger, stopped as he found this thought to be contradictory, and instead continued his search until he had found the hypodermic needle he kept for when he needed to remove the creatures from his domicile. Opening other drawers, he eventually found the cat collar he taken from the neighbour, liking when the creatures he took wore it instead of the clothes they normally wore.<br />
<br />
Still thinking, he muttered, &quot;It's my life and that creature shan't have it,&quot; Leopold headed back to the main room and dropping all that he gathered onto a small table next to the chair he had been sitting in when he had become the creature, he plopped down onto the cushion and picking up the needle, he plunged it into the bottle of &quot;sleepy-time&quot;, his mind now telling him that it was called chloroform, and filling the syringe, he then turned his attention to the car collar, the amulet and the gloves. Slipping the latex on his hands, Leopold began to work, the plan inside his mind becoming clearer and clearer as he went about his business. And when he was finished, still not sure what would happen if he touched the collar and amulet to his exposed skin, he grinned, stood and headed for the secret room, hoping that what he was about to do would work and hadn't been just a fluke.</p>
