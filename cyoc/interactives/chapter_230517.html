<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two months later, Rebecca was curious about what Larry did with the dozen or so tentacle demon eggs she and Rick were laying every other day. Larry assured her that they were safe and would find good homes. Larry did his best to tell the truth to both Rebecca and Larry, but sometimes the cold hard truth can be tough to take. Larry continued the subtle changes to Rick, mostly due to Rebecca&#39;s pestering. Larry was protective of Rick, but he knew the two of them had a strong bond that he didn&#39;t want to affect in any way. College life for the three was going well. They each had very high marks academically and athletically, the team was second in the conference standings with the last matches coming up to end the regular season. Rick was Rebecca&#39;s twin practically, wearing the same clothes. Rick was aware of the changes, most of them, and was fine with how things were. Larry had made Rick&#39;s awareness of some changes delay a bit, because the three of them agreed that Rick was too caught up with holding on to his masculinity to let go all the way. Rick was sitting on the bench in his team bikini when he realized his E cup breasts that felt a little full and when his hand reached between his legs, it was a puffy vulva behind the tight wet bikini bottom. Rick also remembered the discussion where he agreed and could go back if it was an issue. Larry wanted to have the only cock in the group, and Rebecca&#39;s relationship with Rick was the best it had ever been. They had become a true threesome. Larry whispered to Rebecca who were both in the pool with the B team running drills while the starters rested. They both looked at Rick before turning there attention back to the drills. Rick was aware a timer of sorts was running, he would lose his awareness of this change unless he objected, something Larry suggested. Rick was already feeling self conscious, especially with his huge breasts. Rick sat on the bench and pondered for a couple of minutes, then his mind wandered to the perimeter shooting drill the coaches wanted the starters to run. Rebecca saw the expression on Rick&#39;s face, and knew he chose on his own to remain, then she turned to Larry, smiling proudly. Ricki didn&#39;t need to know the truth, not when it holds you back and not making the best of your choices. Larry protected his girls, though Ricki did make one wish, and that was for Larry to not ask every day about wishing, but to do it the day before a special occasion like birthdays or Christmas.<br />
<br />
Larry spent his short time as team captain making the bench warmers starter material. Laps started at 5:45am instead of 6 until they got their 96 laps done in an hour or less. He would work with them in the lap pool for the last 15 minutes doing passing drills or helping them be better swimmers. Those who worked hard did well with Larry, as he also helped supplement their abilities if the training alone was no longer effective. Clayton and Larry were the big men in the pool, but the big guy on the bench was also a football player. Dylan was 280 on a light day, and was six foot 10 inches. Larry was hard on Dylan, pushing him and questioning him if he was sure he wanted to be on the team and to do the work needed. Rebecca found Dylan crying in the showers after a brutal session with Larry. Dylan was resolved not to quit, but he had reached a wall with what he could do. Rebecca offered the crying giant the chance to nurse from her breasts if he could get a second faster in his lap time. Dylan took a week, but he did it, and both Ricki and Rebecca fed the man. Dylan would grow two more inches and pack on a few more pounds, but his lap times were good enough to get a spot on the swim team after a month of training and special milk. Dylan quit the football team after securing his scholarship on the swim team. Larry wanted Dylan to be ready for the playoffs, as no one take him, he was just too powerful, and the coaches saw a double team of Larry and Clayton struggle to defend against Dylan. Rebecca was giving Dylan a sports bottle each morning after practice the last two weeks of the season. The head coach rested Larry for the last three games of the season, and the team still won or tied those last three games, but lost one of the ties due to penalty shots.<br />
<br />
Their team was the only team in the country with both men and women players. They had to get waivers for playoff eligibility. The male teams did their worst below the waterline to harass Ricki and Rebecca, but anyone who dared try found the payback was a hundredfold times worse. Early one, one team&#39;s big guy elbowed Rebecca in the chest and elbowed her in the head. Rebecca broke his nose with a head fake on the next pass play. Rebecca was worse under the water, kicking testicles as hard as she could muster if they were in her way should the offender try something first and the referees never saw anything. If any member of the opposing team thought to come into their dressing room after a game, Dylan and Clayton made sure they never got past the showers.<br />
<br />
Larry managed Clayton&#39;s beta transition. Dylan moved into Clayton&#39;s dorm room at mid-semester. Clayton&#39;s proud bravado was still present, especially in the water, but gone was the bully who had to have his way. Larry slowly helped Clayton become the cuntboy with child bearing hips he desired. Clayton had already been wearing the same bikini brief as Rebecca and Rick. Clayton would smile as his body would make Dylan hard. Clayton would later thank Larry for not having a gag reflex, but Larry said he should thank Dylan as it was his idea. Clayton did a lot of thanking to Dylan for that.<br />
<br />
The small team had four seniors for senior day, three of them starters. All four of them played, and they got all the passes to score all of the goals for that game. They would finish second in their conference and go on to win the conference playoffs. The national tournament would be the week of finals, so they took their exams early before taking the bus to California. The west coast teams had no respect for Larry&#39;s squad. They looked nothing like the other teams, some with their own big guy like Dylan. The first match against Stanford was brutal, going down 0-10 in the opening minutes. The coach tried to motivate the team, but it was Larry who pointed to Clayton that it was their time to lead the charge. Sixteen minutes in it was 3-12. With eight minutes to spare it was 9-14, and in the final minute it was 16-16. Dylan slammed the 17th goal in with twenty seconds to go. Stanford got their 17th goal, but after the whistle blew. The second overall seed went out in the first round to a minor east coast program and the last east team in the playoffs. USC was next for the team the following day. Their big man was as big as Dylan. Rebecca and Ricki were taking a lot of abuse below the waterline in the first few minutes before the girls had enough and paid back four of the USC starters with a several ripped suits and very sore testicles. 7-12 at the half was better but still behind. They trailed 17-18 with under two minutes, and then Larry and the crew performed a clinic on passing and shot blocking, scoring three times and keeping USC from answering, 20-18. Cal was the other winner and the last opponent. Cal had easily defeated both of their opponents with starters only playing half the game. The coaches would bench Rebecca and Ricki for the first eight minutes, as they seemed to be magnets for some dirty play. The new lineup did well to start, only down 3-8 after eight minutes. Rebecca and Ricki came in and it was 9-10 at half. The third period was fought bitterly by both teams, ending 11-12, but spent most of the time tied 11-11. Cal&#39;s starters were still in and they were tired. With 3 minutes to play it was 18-14, then Cal&#39;s starters came back in and it was 18-16 with a minute left, then 18-17. Cal was playing to win, and then Cal didn&#39;t touch the ball again as Clayton, Dylan, and Larry kept leaping out of the water to their knees to catch and throw passes, well above the frantic hands of the Cal players. The three kept the passing drill up for another minute after the final whistle blew just to make a point to the exhausted Cal starters. No east coast team had won the championship in over twenty years. Larry made sure all four of the seniors were in front on the celebration side. The team as a whole jumped into the pool together and all fifteen members started doing pass drills as their way to all enjoy the winning moment.<br />
<br />
The whole team was now sitting on the edge of the pool after most people had left. Larry had pushed the coaching staff into the pool when he noticed they were talking to sports writers and not enjoying the moment. Clayton got the MVP award. The swimming coaches started clapping their hands at the row of 15 sitting on the edge. That night, at the hotel, they all sat in the shallow end of the pool with the coaches and kept that moment alive just a little longer. The bus back east was loading at 8:30am, breakfast was at 6, and it was almost midnight said the equipment manager. They all left the pool about 5:30am to pack before showing up at breakfast. The coaches arranged for a sight seeing trip on the way back, so there were frequent stops of the speedo clad team proud of their victory. The bus&#39;s arrival at the athletic center on campus was a quiet time. The coaches had their things to get done before everyone could leave. Finally, everyone was in the locker room one last time. Larry whispered to Dylan after they cleaned out their lockers, and Dylan smiled. Clayton had finally got his wish and it was Dylan&#39;s for the taking.<br />
<br />
The lights in the locker room flickered on and off, and the head coach was seen at the switch. He loudly proclaimed, &quot;You don&#39;t have to go home, but you can&#39;t stay here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room laughed and then that chapter was over. Everyone slowly made their way to the front door, and into the parking lot. Soon the parking lot was empty. Larry opened the door for Ricki and Rebecca and after Larry closed it, the three of them slid off their speedo and bikinis.<br />
<br />
Rebecca turned to Larry and asked, &quot;Now will you tell me where the tentacle demon eggs go when you take them?&quot;</p>
