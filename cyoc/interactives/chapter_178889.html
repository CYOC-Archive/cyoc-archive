<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The remainder of the school day surprising enough proceeded fairly normally. There were classes and there was talk about the prince and his entourage, but for the most part school continued on as normal. You saw Prince Remelias a couple of times, though you could not get close. A fair number of students were already talking to him, occasionally having some push back from the guards. Girls seemed to like him. Eventually the final bell rang and you walked home for an otherwise uneventful day at home. Video games, homework, internet, some TV, a few idle sketches, bath time and sleep. To your surprise, your little sister points something is weird with your hair. To your surprise, you find that one of the locks in the back is now turquoise.<br />
<br />
The next day you wake up and get ready for school. Things seem normal at first, but as time goes on you notice a few things that are off. The floors seem cleaner, the doors open more smoothly, paint was less chipped and the vulgarities that had been put into his desk or the bathroom stalls had largely disappeared. You put that down to the Prince&#39;s entourage. You also notice in third period Violet, a girl who you known for years though were never close. She came in wearing a hooded cloak. It was green and brown with a copper broach and had a leaf pattern to it. Eventually you ask her about it and she tells you she picked it up at a Gardenian shop that opened up where the old gelato place had been. A few other people had commented on it and thought it looked nice. Normally you could not care less about fashion, but you find yourself in agreement.<br />
<br />
Lunch again was a treat and once again it&#39;s quite enjoyable. This time you savor each bite of the Elven cuisine. You also take a glance at the young prince as he primly dissects his selection. As you do you find something about him, his poise, his thin features the subtle twitches of his long ears. You are broken from this by a familiar voice...<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this seat taken?&quot; Janet asks. She&#39;s been your girlfriend for the last month. She&#39;s a redhead, a bit more broadly built than most and into track and field and drama.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all.&quot; You scooch over and let her take her seat. &quot;So how&#39;s it going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty well actually, everyone was on top of their game at choir. So what&#39;s it like to be with lord Fancypants?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty calm actually. We haven&#39;t talked or anything and he seems polite and aloof. Food&#39;s definitely an improvement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t say I disagree.&quot; She raised a bottle of the Elven tea beverage and you both toast. The conversation continued until the bell rang. You spend a few dollars on a few bottles of elven tea, in case you get thirsty afterwards. After your farewell you end up wondering about something; was she wearing eye-shadow before she talked? Because it seemed to be more popular after lunch, as were more highlights.<br />
<br />
Thursday had Phys-Ed at 1:45 with today&#39;s lesson being basketball. Prince Remelias was there and on your team.  He was clad in an armless gettup with leggings and some sort of light footwear with the big toes separate. It looked quite formal, though it was good athletic wear. This was made obvious as even though he had apparently only heard about Basketball earlier today he soon ended up as the MVP. He was remarkably quick on his feet and was a sure shot at sending the ball where it needed to go. He scored four Slam Dunks, though you notice that both you and your team mates are doing a lot better than how you usually do beyond a couple of times when you just can&#39;t take your eyes off his body in motion.<br />
<br />
When the periods shift, you end up congratulating the prince along with several others. Eventually he replied &quot;this has been a stimulating match, we are most pleased to participate.&quot; He then made his way to the showers. As the prince leaves, you notice that Adam seemed to bob his head to the Elven princeling. Was that a...bow? Like those Japanese businessmen give? You don&#39;t get to ask him as he&#39;s soon off.  When you have your shower, you notice that water comes more cleanly and there is a vague smell in the showers. A hint of something earthy and vegetable. He also noticed that his legs were remarkably smooth. As was your peach fuzz.<br />
<br />
As was the case yesterday you have a fairly unremarkable night. Janet calls you to ask about a date at the mall tomorrow and you confirm that it&#39;s still on. You&#39;d have the house to yourself this weekend, your mother had a business trip and your father was going south with your.<br />
<br />
You sleep in the next night and by the time you&#39;re awake your parents and sister are already off. When you get dressed you notice that your clothes don&#39;t fit quite right. They&#39;re too short and too wide. You need to borrow a belt from your dad before you rush out the door to school as fast as you can go. When you get there and have caught your breath, you noticed that things have changed further still. The doors are less square, tapering off towards the top with less angular metalwork between green tinted glass. The same applied to the lockers, giving a bit of an impression of an arcade. There were also small flourishes here and there in the architecture, which he noticed more of as the day went on. But more striking was the difference in the student body. <br />
<br />
There had been a considerable shift in hair color. Now everyone had at least a highlight with many having more hair in some vibrant color than not. There was also a few people wearing items from the Gardenian store. Some had strange shoes, leggings, a bracer or an vest. They also seemed slimmer than usual and often taller. But the strangest thing was the complexion. Many people were now noticeably paler than before, but what the eyes were drawn to was the prevalence of makeup in a selection of. You end up gawking at a girl with baby blue eyeshadow and dark blue lips, who takes notice of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you staring at?&quot; She says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, your makeup.&quot;<br />
<br />
She snorted &quot;Well you&#39;re one to talk, plummy.&quot; She took out her phone, set it on mirror and put it in your face.  You see your reflection with your eyes framed with light lavender and your lips...yes...plum colored. She soon took the phone out of your face. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I think it suits you.&quot; She said as she went on her way. <br />
<br />
As this happened, Prince Remelias made his way down the hall. Others notice and proceeded to move out of his way to the sides of the halls and as he passes a majority gives him a slight bow. Indeed, before you have noticed, you&#39;ve done the same.<br />
<br />
For all of that,  you tried to keep a sense of normality through the day, even as you keep noticing the changes. Even the teachers seem affected, having apparently lost weight. Others have noticed the changes as well, but there is a reluctance to talk about them. Lunch, once again, was delicious and that helps put you at ease. Even as a piece of paper flutters down before you. You open it and see an elegant message written both in the Roman and the Gardenian Alphabet. It informs you that His Highness Prince Remelias has Invited You (plus one) to his Residence for a Party this evening.<br />
<br />
The rest of the school day continues on as normal leaving you to wonder about what to do. Do you seek the truth or do you try to avoid going down the rabbit hole? Eventually you make up your mind and...</p>
