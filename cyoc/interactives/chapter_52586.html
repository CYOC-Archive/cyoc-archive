<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(AN: Was hit bad emotionally this week, at least twice. This is pathetic of me. And I had the <br />
title for this chapter thought of since. I profusely apologize for this chapter. If you're still <br />
out there unknown, let me know! Seriously, sorry about this pathetic mess of word salad. I <br />
pray to high heaven I can get back in my groove after this fiasco. I REALLY REALLY hope to <br />
get back on schedule. ) <br />
<br />
(AN: WHAO! S1!!!! I didn't expect someone to post a reply just when I was beginning to get <br />
my brain back together! Whao! YOU DID however render a scene I wrote for Lilly and <br />
Casandra redundant. But I'll take out mine since you still showed the twins as unique <br />
individuals unlike the triplets and your stuff is too flattering to not use. And again, sorry <br />
this addition is so chaotic. ) <br />
<br />
There were twenty eight mangled total. Sixteen pride. And twelve pack.  <br />
<br />
That was twenty-three pack members not counting the triplets, alphas, and Martha <br />
unharmed. That left Roger and Robert's sub-packs being the only ones not having a <br />
suffering spouse.  The single wolves Sarah, Trinity, Sunny, and Luna made an extra four. So <br />
that was twenty seven.  With Darla and Julie helping now that was that twenty-nine to <br />
help. This was before counting those who had dropped from exhaustion like Fran though. <br />
With the triplets the only ones with full on medical training sans the triplets first-aid <br />
lessons to the rest of the pack.  And Mr. P didn't have hands, so his help was limited, and <br />
the gargoyles were for the moment still on the island in case of unforeseen trouble and <br />
the shadows were who-knows-where at the moment. <br />
<br />
The alpahs, plus Roger and Fran were both out like lights, and Amethyst was with the gem <br />
twins and the teens were on the island. In short, it was a mess. A complete and total one. <br />
It was going to slow going for both lions and wolves for quite some time. It might have <br />
been logical to just transport the lot of them to the hospital, but the medical wing at the <br />
estate was made precisely for the wolves and the lions were best left where they were <br />
rather than moving them. <br />
<br />
The japanese she-wolves' 'condition' would have crippled them if not for their super <br />
strength. And unlike the triplets of even Amethyst who very much large in that regard, the <br />
Japanese wolves maternal material dove straight into parody territory and didn't look back. <br />
It had been the entire point when they had been statues to have breasts double the size of <br />
beach balls that looked positively ridiculous in spite of the she-wolves own towering <br />
height. And none of the triplets were in a position to perform the surgery the japanese <br />
wolves had discussed among themselves for so long to free themselves of their humiliating <br />
curse.  When growing up they had been enough to make even Ameythst jealous... if she <br />
actually ever got jealous instead of telling them how great they looked.  But they had never <br />
stopped growing until after they hit adulthood, and they had all been early bloomers.  <br />
Maxine, Robyn and Millie wondered if Yomoto was also super sized down there, but where <br />
told they were still too young to be thinking about such things. <br />
<br />
Penny would have preferred to confirm that the wolf pack was indeed now harmless, but <br />
her legs left her in no condition to go anywhere the day. Penny damaged legs were <br />
something else reality would take longer to adjust to. Having gained her power just that <br />
week, and having gone to the gallery wing set aside for curse victims to free Kathy and the <br />
others and getting her legs tendons cut by the japanese wolves who were there for the <br />
same thing would take time for reality to digest. <br />
<br />
The pride was currently less than one third the size of the pack. But once the pride <br />
members had interacted with their loved ones after being mended due to their power <br />
(which was quickly becoming a subconscious power) this would be very much correct. <br />
<br />
If Penny had been with the pride it would have been much simpler to have had her gotten <br />
her damaged legs on Big Bad Island, but being at home with her restored fiancee and his <br />
parents, that wasn't an option. Penny just wondered how long she could put off calling her <br />
parents. 'The world is twisting about so fast, so hard, I feel like I'm going crazy... at least <br />
Kirk's with me if I do go nuts.' <br />
<br />

<br />
Father Paul and Father Mike. Two men cursed, one to have a monkey tail, another to be a <br />
naked orange ape, having come out of the affair intact had begun tirelessly preparing <br />
more of the cure to finally end the curse now that they finally had the aid of those with <br />
authority to use it, opposed to people who thought the curse was just something to live <br />
with.   The cure passed by Merlin the first, the 'man of the woods.'  Of course Michel <br />
insisted to his brother that he rest, but the cursed preacher was nothing if not dauntless <br />
and signed to his brother he wished to help him. The sooner they closed the door on the <br />
curse forever the better.  <br />
<br />
Neither brother even spoke, or even brought up the idea of using the game now that <br />
witches' awareness was gone to use the game to restore themselves. Both had come to <br />
terms with their fate. Both had accepted it. And Paul had pretty much gotten used to <br />
having an extra set of hands. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Being effectively guests at Wolf Manor until their fathers and step-mother were back in <br />
one piece, the eight lion cubs took to going outside, the one place that didn't feel crowded <br />
or rushed. Moja and Tano with their sisters behind them observed the estate. <br />
<br />
&quot;It looks so empty without the gargoyles.&quot; Tatuli said looking around. <br />
<br />
&quot;I still think the fountain could use some figures.&quot; Said her sister Nneli. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I get the gut feelings we've been down that road before?&quot; Mbili wondered.<br />
<br />
That was when they notice Amethyst and most of the gem wolves being led outside. <br />
<br />
&quot;This could be interesting.&quot; Nane said interested. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
Amber did her best to keep up with the others with zeal as they circled the herd to corral <br />
them through the ocean's reflective surface, through the world within mirrors with Alice <br />
and Abbey's help. <br />
<br />
The insanity of Kurse's attempt to twist the entire world into a cesspool of chaos, and the <br />
gruesome injuries all who had suffered save those who had been Kurse's puppets had left <br />
everyone drained. Even after a goodnight's sleep everyone was still emotionally burdened. <br />
<br />
Since the pack and pride had never been at odds, the reality shift would need a good <br />
reason for why the herd had been transplanted to Big Bad Island to begin with. <br />
<br />

<br />
Marie before meeting Lilly and Casandra, Betty and Lawrence. <br />
<br />
After being turned into animal monsters, the children weren't exactly thrilled at the idea of <br />
becoming something else. SO thankfully Marie wasn't bombard with questions on doing <br />
magic favors being a white magic user. <br />
<br />
She kept falling asleep, which she was pretty sure she'd keep doing until the shift in reality <br />
was complete. The cruise yacht was going to take quite a while to reach it's port, leaving <br />
Marie safe and sound with only crew and passengers until the ship came to port.  <br />
<br />
Maybe her naps was due to reality using her perhaps as a 'mortal' perspective. Maybe. Who <br />
knew with chaos? But one cord, as her sanity danced on the edge, struck, as she felt reality <br />
ever shifting to repair itself from the influx of chaos. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor and Queen... never were?&quot; Marie, &quot;No, you, don't!&quot; <br />
<br />
Some would call it campy to call what happened rape. They were wrong. The fear was <br />
there, the pain, the lingering ghosts, and the horrid, overwhelming wrongful -shame-. <br />
The sick memory of some base part of your body felling -pleasure- while your body, and <br />
here mind spirit and soul, were all utterly and completely violated. Kurse's fun house <br />
mirror of paradise. <br />
<br />
No amount of revisions to reality could change what had happened. Samantha entrancced <br />
and remade by Gamorah and Golgatha into the (first) witch Glass, and lured the the small <br />
cruise ship to Big Bad Island, and -everyone- on board were remade into things of <br />
absolute ddepravity to be the ring of protection to the dance of chaos. <br />
<br />
And how reality was doing it's hardest to make sure those transforms that included <br />
'always were' and 'memories revisions' for the pack and pride became as they should be in <br />
time.<br />
<br />
Marie remembered a story she had overheard once. <br />
<br />
The lizard and dust. <br />
<br />
If you turned a man completely into a lizard, fully and completely: was it any different if <br />
you turned a man to dust, and swept away the dust and put a lizard in it's place and <br />
claimed that was the man? <br />
<br />
&quot;But it would not be the same dust.&quot;  Marie thought, &quot;And I'm going to try my bloody <br />
hardest to make sure this 'dust' remains with the other 'dust!' &quot; <br />
<br />
Reality couldn't be sued, arrested, put on trial, made to follow the rules of society as <br />
defined by the local culture and law, it simply was. It wasn't good or evil, it was only doing <br />
what came naturally to it, doing it's best to create consistency after the chaos that had <br />
infected it. It couldn't be argued with, not pleaded with, not provoked with brave <br />
speeches. <br />
<br />
&quot;Reality is neither kind nor cruel, it has no heart to be either. Reality has no plot or <br />
agenda, no higher court to take it to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reality as a rule followed the path of least resistance when healing itself. <br />
<br />
Marie wondered what penance she'd end up paying for twisting reality a certain way even <br />
as it tried to heal. <br />
<br />
A tabby queen, (as was the name for any cat who had had kittens), had come across the <br />
cub Trevor, and thought him a tabby male, perhaps her sense of smell wasn't that good, <br />
or maybe she trusted her eyes more than her noise, or maybe she was just that desperate <br />
with so many males in Glendale neutered. <br />
<br />
Trevor wanted the cat gone, and had tried several times, even when his makeshift <br />
guardian Madan Serenity told him to be polite to the poor cat to be friends with her. It was <br />
ironically what his sister Sabrina would have said too (or Nala as she loved to be called at <br />
school as a joke on the famous movie even if she didn't even remotely look the part). <br />
<br />
Queen as he named her didn't understand the aging progress difference between mundane <br />
cats and liomans. <br />
<br />
Trevor had dreams. Dreams where he was a mundane cat, had fallen in love with Queen <br />
and had a litter with her. Needless to say for an eight year old going on nine these dreams <br />
were very confusing and very odd. <br />
<br />
With construction work being done on the front of the mansion, Trevor attempting to visit <br />
his friends in secret with Queen following had ended in disaster. The four legged, titanic, <br />
and elderly werewolf 'Mr. P', had smelled Queen and Trevor and not recognizing their <br />
scents had attacked them, Queen was dead, eaten, and Trevor with his leg bitten through. <br />
Trevor had wandered along bleeding until he collapsed and was found by Judas and taken <br />
to the local catholic church. <br />
<br />
Roughly at the same time Mary was confronted by a very dangerous man who didn't seem <br />
to human, lioman, or luman. A tourbus with bad breaks saved her life who had been led to <br />
the church by Judas who had reintroduced the two pack mates to each other. The two had <br />
hugged each other not having seen each other in over a year since Trevor had vanished <br />
into thin air papers calling it suicide. <br />
<br />
Mr. P of course had profusely apologized for what had happened and even offered up his <br />
own life in exchange to restore his honor but that offer had been thankfully been <br />
declined. <br />
<br />
Mr. P was old. Quite old. Maybe even well over a hundred if his world war one tales were <br />
to be believed. But he was still muscular, didn't have a shade of gray on his black and gold <br />
fur, and was still even going about on his four legs as towering as his great-grandson <br />
Jensen near nine feet being the tallest member of the pack. (It was a bit of a joke on how <br />
the lionesses were about nine feet on average and the male lions even larger!). <br />
<br />
Terri and Sandi rumored he had found the fountain of youth at the price of standing up <br />
right. Jasmine thought he might have very well have been THE Big Bad Wolf that european <br />
fairy tales told about and their pack was named after. Though she was quickly and harshly <br />
berated for that rumor given how Mr. P acted nothing like the titular cannibalistic stalker. <br />
Megan chalked it up to just healthy living and suggested maybe he just had a genetic <br />
condition that left him mutate into a quadruped in his elderly years opposed to getting <br />
old and gray and a similar condition would pop up in the rest of the pack when they got <br />
'his age' (whatever that was). This left began on the receiving end of Kaylee's wrath after it <br />
gave the pups nightmares. <br />
<br />
Then of course was the theory put forth by none other than Zelipe that maybe 'Mr P.' was <br />
a REAL werewolf, one of the legendary shape shifters who appeared in the movies, but Mr. <br />
P didn't really seem the blood-thirsty psychotic type that ALL sources said werewolves <br />
were. <br />
<br />
None of the lesser pack members knew which rumor if any was true. All anyone knew was <br />
that while 'Mr. P' was no longer alpha male, when he spoke, all listened, including Jensen <br />
and his eldest child (by several seconds) Jenny. Jensen still had a replacement tooth from <br />
where he had foolish challenged his great-grandfather as Patriarch a short time before he <br />
had married Kaylee and the triplets.  <br />
<br />
Mr. P himself just seemed content to be with his great-grand children being his protector. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
The shadows stood like the zombie puppets they were. Nothing on the inside, just <br />
shadows with strings connected to the two pups Jenny and Bart. They had names of <br />
course. But they only matter as far as the file name in a computer matter. It was simply <br />
something to create the pretense they were people. Jensen had not wanted the shadows to <br />
be caught underfoot during the war with the pride and had sent them away. Now they <br />
were still victims of the curse, and there had been no reason for the pride or pack to be in <br />
conflict ever. But that still left six shadows, three of them former males. <br />
<br />
Reality's natural reaction was to remove any of the pack or pride having originally been <br />
human what so ever, and both the pride and pack both being part of the same pack/pride. <br />
Of course the pack had Wolf Manor (never formally Smith Manor), or Big Bad Manor or the <br />
like to act as a central place for the wolf pack's commune.  What reality would do to <br />
conjoin the pride together besides the majority of them being part of the police force was <br />
an unknown at this point since they would be linked to the wild game grounds the herd <br />
would inhabit. <br />
<br />
However the shadows were human, and while reality was trying it's hardest to remove any <br />
link the pack or pride had to the game, the simple truth was that it could not do this <br />
totally since reality could NOT advert or remove the destruction of Gaal's shade, or Kurse's <br />
defeat. <br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny had gotten their turns from a little boy named Billy who had gotten it from <br />
his mother after she had Dared him to do his homework every night until he moved out to <br />
collage, who had gotten it from a woman who had Dared her to become a nudist, do a <br />
dance, and transfer a fortune to the other woman's checking account, and so on. <br />
<br />
Billy had given them a harmless Dare thinking they'd use the Transform to make him a <br />
wolf boy, but Bart and Jenny had biggest ideas. <br />
<br />
The eldest twins were like almost the emperor of china had been, while they were not <br />
prisoners per-say of their own home, Jensen made sure they were always protected, and <br />
their time outside the estate's grounds was still always carefully monitored by any number <br />
of loyal protectors. <br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny were still as smart as before reality began to streamline existence, having <br />
knowledge and IQs that were that of collage courses. Alice, and to a lesser extent <br />
Samantha and Abbey, were masters of semantics, the beautiful structure of words.<br />
<br />
Kevin and Marcy of course had to deal with growing up how all their siblings seemed to <br />
have mutant super brain power while they did not.  Thankfully both were still too young <br />
and carefree to really give it much though. <br />
<br />
They actually scared the other pups sometimes with how smart they were and some of the <br />
adult wolves. The tutors weren't kidding when they said Jensen two eldest pups were <br />
possible in fact smarter than their parents when it came to business and law. <br />
<br />
It was Bart and Jenny, in light of recent events, who had confessed their acts to their <br />
parents and to the police. Knowing they couldn't be taken seriously in the outside world, <br />
in spite of their intellect. So, as children wanting recognition, they came up with their <br />
clever if short sighted scheme. The pack had no humans in it's employ, it didn't need <br />
them. The sheer ingrained altruistic loyalty of the pack members insured responsibilities <br />
were seen to. <br />
<br />
But being out and about, Bart and Jenny only needed to lure six hard working employees <br />
of some of the pack's businesses, to them.  And Bart and Jenny through them proved how <br />
brilliant they really were.  Which had, in this reality, set off the chain reaction of events. <br />
<br />
Of course there was the fact it had been done by a pair of nine year olds.   The idea both <br />
had been under the influence of the malice of the curse rather than just being foolish or <br />
selfish children was a much more palatable story for many rather than two children who <br />
had used the power of the game to turn six people into their shadows on their own. After <br />
all, they were children, they couldn't possibly understand the full scale of what they did, <br />
could they?  Whatever the case, given this was Glendale, and how those cursed and those <br />
who cursed had been almost always turned a blind eye towards by the law, the only true <br />
punishment Bart and Jenny faced was from their parents. And that was awe inspiring and <br />
terrible. <br />
<br />
In the aftermath, it was easier to blame the echoes of three wicked witches and their <br />
familiars than it was to blame two children. This included the rest of the pack and their <br />
parents.  Of course, who was to say even this version of things would remain in place for <br />
once, or weather reality had created this version of events just as a stop gap for a proper <br />
assimilation of things? <br />
<br />
Amy had awoken her brother after Martha had for the moment taken her eyes off of the <br />
pup's bedroom (which seemed larger than before once again and now had five double <br />
bunk-beds on the far side, then again, the entire manor and estate did with a larger <br />
family and the resources of the various pack mates now in one basket as reality brought it <br />
all together). <br />
<br />
&quot;Ammi?&quot; Zelipe slurred. <br />
<br />
Amy nodded, &quot;Come on Zel-kun', we have something we need to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong we need to set right... just because we're Big and Bad doesn't mean we <br />
have to be awful.&quot; Amy took her brothers hands and let him along. Zelipe himself going <br />
along for the ride as he felt he always did. It was always one of the others who led, he was <br />
always the wallflower in the embrace of his mother. <br />
<br />
With nearly everyone either outside or in the medical wing, the manor created the illusion <br />
of being deserted. There was the giant she-wolf statue in the entry way of course. Zelipe <br />
couldn't shake the feeling that it was looking at them amused even though Zelipe <br />
remembered when the pack had put it together inside the house because it wouldn't fit <br />
inside the front door in one piece. Zelipe didn't act when his sister just smiled and nodded <br />
as if in recognition looking the giant statue in the eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Amy.. why do you always need to be so vague?&quot; He asked his half-sister. While he had <br />
been born a VERY short time before Amy (their mothers had gone into labor on the same <br />
day), she always acted as if the elder sibling, leading along. <br />
<br />
&quot;... I'm not sure Zel-kun. I think I just think like that.&quot; <br />
<br />
They came then to the basement.  It was filled with lots and lots of junk various pack <br />
members had no further use for and as a tradition were systematically sold off, most <br />
recently off of ebay. The commune mentality of the pack helped this along. <br />
<br />
Also standing in a line as if called there were six people in business suits, three women <br />
who looked a lot like Jennifer The First had before becoming Jenny the wolf cub, and the <br />
others who looked pretty much like Bartholomew Smith before becoming Jensen's son <br />
Bart.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So this is where Jensen-Sama and Alpha-Female-Sama have kept you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sis... these are those people Jenny and Bart changed with the games... what are they <br />
doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're here so we can free them. They can't answer yes or no to the game anymore <br />
because they just puppets now. But their souls and minds are still there, simple now giant <br />
mirrors for Bart and Jenny's wills and intents. And Bart and Jenny now that things are over <br />
want to make amends for this...&quot; <br />
<br />
Zelipe nodded understanding as the two split up and began touching the statues. <br />
However, Amy whispered one thing in her half-brother's ear, his eye went wide, then he <br />
nodded though not fully understanding Amy's intent. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are a big bad wolf... like Martha's kind. You are a big bad wolf... like Martha's kind. <br />
You are a big bad wolf... like Martha's kind. You are a big bad wolf... like Martha's kind. <br />
You are a big bad wolf... like Martha's kind. You are a big bad wolf... like Martha's kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
The six shadows eyes widened, and with it came recognition, awareness, and <br />
independence, and a drive of self again, they were self aware before, but everything had <br />
been just an echo of Jenny and Bart's intents before now, slowly, that was changing. <br />
<br />
The fur grew first. Two of the men's fur was silver like Martha's only both with bluish <br />
highlights. Another was gold (like Giselle and Gretchen). Two of the women were silver <br />
with red markings (on her chest looking like a nurse's red cross), and silver with reddish <br />
orange highlights.  Their eyes blinked, and became a solid color like Martha's were, with <br />
colors that matched their highlights. <br />
<br />
 Their faces grew into the familiar fang filled muzzles. Their fingers and toes became non-<br />
retractable claws, which they quickly used to tear away the clothes that felt both alien and <br />
restrictive on their bodies now even as they felt feeling other than urges to do as their <br />
pups would have them do and satisfaction of a job well done and blind loyalty to the ones <br />
whom they had been shadows of.  <br />
<br />
Two fully tails grew out of each of their rears.  Their muscle masses increased, though <br />
remaining agile and lithe, they also grew to six feet, then the men seven feet tall. <br />
<br />
It seemed instead of having four nipples, for the the men something else had been <br />
doubled like a pair of sheathed samurai swords. Did this technically make them <br />
marsupials? Amy demented wondered if Martha now had two opening between her legs. <br />
<br />
The one with silver highlights moaned, but not in pain as her body transmuted more, a <br />
second pair of tails grew from her rear, then another. Then -four- extra arms grew from <br />
her, as did four breasts, and finally, like a mirror trick, three heads from from her one <br />
head, all three together possessing a combined consciousness. In spite of all this, nothing <br />
seemed.. crowded on her... everything looking like it perfectly biologically belonged.  The <br />
first thing that entered her minds were, 'I hope Madam Martha isn't jealous of us. Though <br />
maybe we should help the Beta-Females.'  Unlike Martha however, she did not have the <br />
third eye. <br />
<br />
Only the orange-red highlighted one kept her hair which curled up into a upwards style. <br />
The rest quickly became 'bald.' <br />
<br />
The third eye appeared on the two males with blue highlights. The third female who also <br />
grew a pair of arms but kept a singular head and one pair of breasts. The two blue <br />
highlighted males like a mirror trick also soon had two heads, each pair connected to a <br />
singular brain. Then came the two males second pair of arms. The one with blue and gold <br />
highlights thought, 'I hope Martha thinks I'm beautiful.' <br />
<br />
They knelt in the shredded remains of those clothes and looked at each other and <br />
themselves. <br />
<br />
Amy said, &quot;In the name of Alpha Male Jensen-Sama.  Speak the pack creed, and tell us <br />
your names, fur color, and purpose.&quot; There was no point asking for family names, the <br />
pack members didn't use last names, the pack was their family after all, it disrupted their <br />
sense of unity. 'Please.' Amy thought, 'Let them have SOULS again!'</p>
