<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thad and Josh were already fooling around when they reached the playing field. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's play, polo with the JV team,&quot; Josh said, &quot;Thad, you can be my polo pony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, first lemme grab a drink. You want one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, later. There're only 2 JV brats out there and I wanna see their faces when I come <br />
riding up to them on your broad shoulders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Slurp, good cool one. Okay, hop on my shoulders,&quot; Thad said.<br />
<br />
Jay and Rod looked up to see Josh riding toward them on Thad's shoulders. Suddenly, Josh <br />
dropped out of the air, and sat down hard on the ground with Thad's football helmet <br />
between his legs.<br />
<br />
Josh stood up and said, &quot;Now that was creative.&quot;<br />
<br />
Under his butt he recognized Thad's startled face. Thad was flat as a pancake. The football <br />
pads fell out as Josh lifted Thad and his jersey. He extracted Thad from his jersey and <br />
carefully examined the flattened football player. <br />
<br />
&quot;Still warm to the touch. I can see his flattened feet on his bottom, and those must be his <br />
balls and that stubby thing sticking out is his flattened cock? Ew, it's wet like he's leaking <br />
precum or something,&quot; complained Josh shaking his wet finger in the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;What'd ya do to him?&quot; asked Rod in a concerned voice, &quot;I've never seen anything like that. <br />
You turned Thad into a Frisbee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Frisbee? Let's see, catch!&quot; he said flinging Thad at Rod.<br />
<br />
Rod reached out and caught the Frisbee Thad. &quot;Whoa, this is frigging weird, and why is it <br />
wet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're squeezing his cock,&quot; Josh answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew! Yuck!&quot; shouted Rod dropping Thad and wiping the goo off on his football shorts.<br />
<br />
Josh quickly picked Thad up and asked, &quot;So, Jay, will this work for the bet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay said, &quot;It's unusual but I think they'll love it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rod asked, &quot;Have you two been conspiring?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh said, &quot;Not exactly. The whole varsity team knows about this bet and they agreed to it. <br />
It's not our fault that they didn't believe we were serious or could make good on the bet.&quot;<br />
<br />
By that time, most of the rest of the team had shown up. Josh walked over to the Gatorade <br />
cooler and served drinks to the team as they head out to the field.<br />
<br />
After he'd given drinks to everyone, Josh yelled &quot;Dog pile&quot; and runs up the field. As the <br />
defensive end tackled josh with 250 pounds of solid muscle, josh flattened out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell!? Where did that pip squeak go!&quot; says the gorilla of a man. Emphasis on was <br />
a man, for a minute later he was tackled and all that remained of him was a 2d image of <br />
him in full gear. Five other guys were also flattened by the dog pile.<br />
<br />
The rest of the team just looked on dumbfounded knowing that they all just saw josh and <br />
there defensive end turn into cut outs. The quarterback looked on and said &quot;What's <br />
happening!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay came up to them and said, &quot;Remember the bet you made, the one where you said you <br />
would win the next game or you would all serve as towel boys and jockstraps? Well, I'm <br />
here to collect. I'll distribute all of you to the JV team for a week and then I will collect you <br />
so you can try again to win.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jay spoke, he picked up Josh and peeled him out of his uniform, holding him up for <br />
emphasis.<br />
<br />
The quarterback said, &quot;We thought you were joking. You mean you can turn us into <br />
jockstraps?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay said, &quot;Of course, I'd let you watch as I finish transforming Josh here but you need to be <br />
flattened soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
The football team grumbled for a while and some tried to get out from under the bet but <br />
they were obligated. They began to prepare themselves for flattening as one by one they <br />
got rolled up and put in the duffel bag. Jay stripped several of the flattened guys right <br />
there before rolling them up.<br />
<br />
Billy asked, &quot;Do you have to strip us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay said, &quot;Eventually so I can finish up the transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy then picked up Thad and asked, &quot;Do you want something creative like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay said, &quot;Sure, if you've got any good ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy threw Thad to some of the waiting players and they decided to play some frisbee while <br />
they waited their turn. Billy, meanwhile, tried to roll himself into a ball before being <br />
flattened. Jay then flattened him from his side after making sure that his genitals were still <br />
visible pointing down between his legs. Then other players got creative with their poses.<br />
<br />
Rod asked, &quot;Josh helped you set this up and then he got himself flattened. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay said, &quot;Let's just say that Josh wanted to do something with his teammates that would <br />
really bond them and motivate them to win future games.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rod walked over and fished out Chad, his flattened friend, from among the former jocks. <br />
&quot;If you're distributing these to the JV team, may I have this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay said, &quot;Sure, you like him a lot, don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rod said, &quot;I just want to take care of him and make sure he isn't treated too bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay took all the jocks to the laundry and finished stripping them to put in the wash. He <br />
added more chemicals and the jocks came out shrunk. <br />
<br />
&quot;This one, Chad, he's the one you want?&quot; Jay asked.<br />
<br />
Rod asked, &quot;You can restore him to normal in a week right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay said, &quot;Absolutely.&quot; Then he sneezed and blew his nose on Chad. &quot;Excuse me, and sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rod asked, &quot;Does he know that you just blew your nose on him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay said, &quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rod asked, &quot;How do you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay answered, &quot;Josh flattened me before. He's the one who came up with the chemicals. I <br />
was mad at him because he didn't ask if I wanted to be flattened. He just wanted to test the <br />
chemicals out. I could see, hear and feel everything. I could even move a little and I could <br />
make a tiny noise. These jocks will have to agree to use this ability for our benefit or they <br />
may be made to stay this way for longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay then took the jocks to the sewing machine and began his work. Jay sewed the jocks and <br />
some other cloths together until he was finished. He handed the transformed Chad to Rod.<br />
<br />
&quot;You made him a jockstrap.&quot; Rod said.<br />
<br />
Jay asked, &quot;Would you rather that I turned him into a towel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rod said, &quot;No, but I have to have a cup.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay picked up a cup and pushed it up Chad's ass. The cup inside Chad was as big as Chad.<br />
<br />
Rod reluctantly agreed to wear Chad. It took some convincing before Rod accepted that <br />
Chad had agreed to this bet.<br />
<br />
Josh was turned into Jay's personal cum rag. Thad was kept as a frisbee for the JV team to <br />
play around with. Billy was considered too cute to hide so he was posted in the trophy case <br />
like a poster for everyone to look at.<br />
<br />
The parents were upset and wanted their sons restored immediately but after some <br />
explanation, the parents finally agreed to allow their sons to honor the bet. One parent <br />
said, &quot;Maybe it will teach him to be more careful about gambling.&quot;<br />
<br />
A week had passed and it was time to restore the jocks. Rod patted his jockstrap and said, <br />
&quot;You've been a great jockstrap. You're my lucky jockstrap. I wish I could wear you for every <br />
game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, Chad was restored and had a chance to explain his side of what happened.</p>
