<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ryan sat there, the first obstacles became clear to both him and Mikey as Mikey realized he didn&#39;t know Ryan&#39;s locker combination. Even though they swapped, they had no idea of eachother&#39;s lives. Ryan initially thought he could use this as leverage against Mikey, but realized Mikey could just call off the deal and get the info from the coach on Monday, so he gave Mikey the combination and watched as Mikey changed into his clothes, as he picked up his old cell phone and realized Stacy had left some texts and voicemail. As he listened through them, he could tell she was pissed, and threatened to break up with him, but on the bright side, he wouldn&#39;t have to worry about teaching Mikey about sex quite as soon.<br />
<br />
Mikey helped Ryan with navigating his own phone, and Ryan called Mikey&#39;s parents to let them know he was staying with a friend this weekend. They seemed thrilled that Mikey was making friends and just told him to call them if he needed anything or was going somewhere. Mikey seemed embarrassed, but as they headed to Ryan&#39;s house he felt like they seemed to care more than his parents.<br />
<br />
As they arrived at Ryan&#39;s house, Mikey saw the long grass and peeling paint, and realized things weren&#39;t exactly ideal in the Standish house. He didn&#39;t want to pry, but Ryan merely said his parents weren&#39;t home that much anymore. Probably didn&#39;t know he was missing.<br />
<br />
Ryan started with giving Mikey a tour, showing him the weights in the basement and running him through a day&#39;s exercise routine, which Mikey performed well. Seems his body kinda took to the old routine well, though Mikey had issues visualizing what to do. Ryan also showed Mikey what to expect when he was back in his own body if he wanted to put on some muscle, and the two of them were eventually drenched in sweat and sore from the exertion. The two of them showered, Ryan going first, and getting changed into a spare set of clothes Mikey had in his sports bag in the locker room, and he admired himself in the mirror as Mikey took his time in the shower. A few moans reaching Ryan&#39;s ears told him what he was doing in there, but Ryan knew he was just a repressed kid with a new toy to play with. Mikey emerged later in a cloud of steam, beet red and stark naked. Ryan showed him to his room and Mikey admired all of his medals and trophies, before Ryan snapped him back to reality throwing clothes at him.<br />
<br />
Ryan did his best to show him all the people he hung out with in a yearbook and give a rundown on who to talk to and what about, and tried to get Mikey to talk like he was cool like Ryan. It was obvious that Mikey still had some confidence issues, but maybe people would see it as nerves. The end of year game was coming up in a couple of weeks against their rivals, and as cool as Ryan played it, everyone always seemed to act like he was nervous.<br />
<br />
The two of them spent the night in Ryan&#39;s house, Ryan sleeping on the living room sofa, and on Sunday they ran through more exercises and tips, including fashion. It seemed Mikey&#39;s parents were fairly well off, planting the idea in Ryan&#39;s mind to see about getting a new look for Mikey if this arrangement went on too much longer. Finally though, that night Mikey walked Ryan home, telling him how to act around his parents, and worried they&#39;d be really uncool and embarrassing. They were happy to meet Mikey&#39;s new friend, and invited him to dinner, but Mikey backed out, feeling weird about this and making an excuse that his parents already had dinner waiting for him. Mikey&#39;s parents were disheartened but still excited to hear about how Ryan&#39;s weekend went. He got through dinner and excused himself to his room, full of expensive electronics like video game consoles, a big tv, and even having a computer on the desk. He messed around with it a bit, his heart filled with yearning for it all, having grown up poor with only sports as an outlet, he tended to only have friends who had these kinds of things, and not nearly this much. But now it was his... or rather Mikey&#39;s. As much as he liked it all, he still wanted his life back. And who knows, maybe Mikey would invite him over once they swapped back.<br />
<br />
He contemplated how weird this all was as he laid in bed that night, not even realizing until he was hard that he had been stroking himself as he was deep in thought, something he did so matter-of-factly in his old body too. He hoped he could get Mikey convinced to give him back his body soon. Until then, this wasn&#39;t a bad vacation home, all things considered.</p>
