<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They had watched the news report together.<br />
Jack Crawford being arrested by the Federal authorities on suspicion of murder for hire was big news.<br />
<i>Thankfully there&#39;s no mention of Moon Lake, let alone weres,</i> thought Doctor Frances Twist, as she watched the television broadcast with Benton and Amanda Knight.<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t of happened to a nicer jerk,&quot; commented Benton, as the report ended.<br />
&quot;I agree,&quot; said Frances, thinking about how Crawford had bugged her office and invaded the sanctity of her therapy practice.<br />
Before Benton&#39;s wife Amanda or anyone else could say another word, his private line rang.<br />
Wondering who that could be, he answered it.<br />
&quot;Hi dad,&quot; came the familiar voice on the other end. &quot;Do you have a second?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure Frieda,&quot; Benton told his daughter. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; he asked, as Amanda turned her head to eavesdrop on the conversation.<br />
&quot;I just need to double check something. How accurate was that information Brock Stone gave you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Very accurate. Why?&quot; Benton asked in return.<br />
&quot;Because Jeff Wilson attacked Eric over it,&quot; replied Frieda.<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; shouted Benton.<br />
Considering everyone in the room was weres too, this briefly stung their ears as Frieda said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. Wilson&#39;s going to jail where he belongs, and Eric will be all right as soon as he gets his nose looked at. The school nurse is doing what she can for him now, but we&#39;re waiting for his dad to get here with a change of clothes because Eric went furry during the attack. I&#39;m afraid the clothes you loaned him are toast, though.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay sweetheart. Just as long as you, him, and Spencer are all right,&quot; he replied, remembering to include the third member of Frieda&#39;s... group.<br />
&quot;Other than being worried about Eric, Spencer and I are just fine,&quot; replied Frieda, as a muffled voice in the background said, &quot;Dell dim I&#39;m dorry about de dos.&quot; <i>(For those who don&#39;t speak broken nose, Eric said, &quot;Tell him I&#39;m sorry about the clothes.&quot;)</i><br />
&quot;Okay dad. I&#39;ve got to go now. Eric&#39;s dad just walked in. Love you,&quot; said Frieda, before hanging up.<br />
&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Amanda wanted to know. The ladies had heard what they could of the conversation, but were lacking details.<br />
&quot;One of the many things I want to talk to Frances about,&quot; said Benton, turning to look at Doctor Twist. &quot;I&#39;m beginning to realize Frieda isn&#39;t a little girl any more, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m ready yet to deal with her as an adult.&quot;<br />
&quot;No parent truly is when the realization first hits them,&quot; replied Frances, thinking about her relationship with her adopted son Ben. &quot;And we&#39;ll get to that in time. But first I think it&#39;s more important to get back to the dynamics of the relationship you and Amanda have.&quot;<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Unaware of the media attention he&#39;s receiving, Jack Crawford (thankfully still in his human form) currently still sits in a Seattle jail cell, awaiting word of his status.<br />
<i>No one in Moon Lake is behind this frame job?</i> he kept asking himself, recalling the words Tachibana no Akane told his lawyer to tell him: &quot;We will do what we can, although your current troubles with the Federal authorities are all of your own creation.&quot;<br />
Not willing to admit for once second that perhaps it was his own stupidity that got him into this mess, Crawford kept thinking.<br />
<i>Then Jose, or whatever his real name is, must have used me as a patsy to help him attempt to kill that mobster. Yet the only people who would want a mobster dead are either the authorities or another mobster,</i> he reasoned. <i>Well, whoever put me behind bars, they&#39;re going to have one VERY ANGRY werepanther to deal with once I get out of here, even if I have to destroy all of what the media calls organized crime in the process!</i> he swore.<br />
While the prisoner was alone, those watching him thought they heard a low but menacing growl echo throughout the holding facility.<br />
Yet there were no wild animals inside or on the loose.<br />
Were there?<br />
<br />
BACK AT MOON LAKE HIGH SCHOOL...<br />
&quot;BAB!&quot; yelled Eric Anderson, happy to see his father, who had a small plastic bag of clothing with him. <i>(&quot;DAD!&quot;)</i><br />
&quot;Are you all right son?&quot;  William Anderson asked his child. He couldn&#39;t help noticing that Frieda Knight was holding one of Eric&#39;s paws while Spencer Lawson held the other.<br />
&quot;I dam dow,&quot; said the white furred werepanther, while taking the bag from his father. <i>(&quot;I am now.&quot;)</i><br />
&quot;De durse said das dune das I defur and det dressed, I dan do to de dospital and det dy dose det. Den dat&#39;s done, it dill de dealed dy donight.&quot; <i>(&quot;The nurse said as soon as I defur and get dressed, I can go to the hospital and get my nose set. When that&#39;s done, it will be healed by tonight.&quot;)</i><br />
&quot;I tried to do what I could for your son here, but without x-ray equipment, I&#39;m uncertain of the exact state of the damage, let alone resetting it properly,&quot; explained the school nurse, before she suggested to Spencer and Frieda that maybe they should leave the room to give Eric some privacy to get dressed.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay. The ladies are my son&#39;s mates,&quot; replied William, before either girl could say something.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said the nurse, looking at the three students. &quot;Off the record, that must be one hell of a relationship,&quot; she said with a smile.<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; replied Spencer with a smile of her own, while looking at Frieda and Eric.<br />
Eric laid out the clothing, which thankfully included underwear and shoes, then started to defur.<br />
Everything was going well until the transformation reached his face.<br />
Eric yelled in pain as he resumed his werepanther form, even as the eyes of all three students glowed a brighter shade of green in unison.<br />
&quot;I was afraid of that,&quot; admitted the nurse. &quot;The nasal damage is too severe for Eric to transform back into his human shape. I&#39;m going to have to make arrangements to transport him covertly to Moon Lake General as is. They can reset his nose, have him transform back, and then double check to make sure it&#39;s properly set there. Once that&#39;s done, his natural were healing factor will have him as good as new by bedtime tonight. Tomorrow morning at the latest, depending upon how long it takes to get him treated. But that also means no sex for him tonight,&quot; explained the school nurse.<br />
Frieda and Spencer frowned as Eric held his sore muzzle in both paws again.<br />
&quot;A dall dice do day do det detter,&quot; he said. <i>(&quot;A small price to pay to get better.&quot;)</i><br />
&quot;Okay. First we get Eric taken care of, but I definitely want to talk to Principal Andrews when I get the chance,&quot; replied William Anderson.</p>
