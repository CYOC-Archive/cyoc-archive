<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Brittany slammed the door in her face, Mary sat down and fumed.  It had been such a great day, and Brittany had ruined it.  <br />
<br />
Just like always, thought Mary glumly. <br />
<br />
At first she hated the ugly shoes.  She only wore them to please Brittany.  Brittany wasn&#39;t that nice, but she was the only one that ever paid any attention to her.  Her parents were always too busy, she didn&#39;t have any siblings, and everyone at school avoided her.  She suspected it was because her family&#39;s wealth and position in the community intimidated everyone, but she also knew that she was not that attractive or interesting.  So she tolerated Brittany, because  a bad friend was better than none at all.  But today she had gone too far.  <br />
<br />
She really didn&#39;t care about the shoes.  She knew they were ridiculous, and that Brittany was only getting her to wear them to humiliate her, but the truth was that she really didn&#39;t care what anyone in town thought about her.  They could stare and laugh all they wanted; she couldn&#39;t become even more of a pariah than she already was.  The only problem was that at first it was really difficult to walk in them.  She had never really walked in heels, and the shoes had a ridiculously long thin stiletto heel, forcing her to walk on the extreme balls of her feet.  But once she got used to it, it was actually a lot of fun.  The shoes made Mary feel taller.  She hated being so short, always having to look up at everyone, tolerating the occasional pat on the head, and the relentless commentary on how cute she was.  More often than she liked she was mistaken for a child.  Secretly, she envied Brittany&#39;s height and mature features, and desired to be more like a woman herself.  So today she reveled in her new found height, even if it was just an illusion.  <br />
<br />
But, of course, Brittany couldn&#39;t ever allow her to have even a little fun, so she demanded they return home. Then she forced her to stay outside like some kind of animal when she couldn&#39;t remove the shoes. The thought made her burn with anger, more anger than she had ever felt before.  The intensity of her anger actually surprised herself a little. Idly she wondered why she couldn&#39;t remove the boots.  They were tight before, but she didn&#39;t think it would be this hard to remove them. A sudden tearing sound distracted her from her thoughts. At first she thought perhaps the boots had torn, but when she examined them she could find no defect.  When she stood, she saw that the waistband of her skirt had ripped.  <br />
<br />
Great, thought Mary angrily.  Maybe the bitch was right. I am getting bloated.  It wasn&#39;t time for her period, and she hadn&#39;t felt any cramps, so she didn&#39;t know why she might be retaining water.  <br />
<br />
Enough of this shit, she thought,  I need to get inside and change clothes.  She tried to open the door, but saw that it was locked from the inside.  <br />
<br />
Stupid bitch, cursed Mary.  How are she lock ME out here! She was about to bang on the door, when she noticed something strange.  The door handle was smaller than she remembered, and seemed to be further below her.  She knew the boots made her taller, but she didn&#39;t remember being this tall.  She looked to her hands, and saw that they were larger, her fingers were shorter and stubby, and that her nails appeared black and thick.  A slight webbing was forming between her fingers.  <br />
<br />
My hands kind of look like my feet, she thought with some fear. What is going on?<br />
<br />
She knocked on the door.  &quot;Brittany, let me in &quot; she said, but heard no response (Brittany was in the bathroom, but she didn&#39;t know it).   <br />
<br />
Where is that stupid bitch, she thought angrily.  Suddenly, her whole body felt sore and warm.  She felt like someone was pulling and stretching her in all different directions.  She heard a loud tearing sound, and saw her skirt fall to the ground.  She looked down at the boots, and saw that the cuff of the boot now extending to her much larger thighs, and she could find no distinction between the boots and her skin.  Her panties gripped her ass tightly, and her lower back ached, under she suddenly felt an explosive growth extend from her back, destroying her panties in  the process.  She reached behind her and saw that it was a large thick tail, covered in thick scaly leather and small spines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brittany, help, &quot; she said weakly, as pain erupted in her face. Her nose felt swollen, and her jaw ached unbearably, until it suddenly relaxed as her jaw grew into a long snout filled with sharp teeth.  She rubbed her snout with her hands, now covered in thick scales, and  ran her tongue along her sharp teeth.  She heard another ripping sound, and felt her abdomen and chest swell as her breast receded into her chest, destroying her bulky sweater in the process and leaving her completely nude.<br />
<br />
Finally, it was over, but Mary&#39;s anger had reached it&#39;s boiling point.<br />
<br />
That stupid bitch! she thought angrily.  Look what she&#39;s done to me.  I&#39;m a freak, a monster.  And all because of those stupid boots she made me wear.  Well, it&#39;s  time for some payback.  Way past time for some payback.<br />
<br />
Mary banged on the door with surprising strength, and it buckled.<br />
<br />
Mary knocked again, and the door splintered a little.  She heard a small quiet voice, say &quot;Mary, Something terrible has happened and I need your help.&quot; It sounded a little like Brittany but weaker and less confident.  For some reason, the voice annoyed her and fueled her rage.<br />
<br />
She knocked a third time, and growled, &quot;Let me in.&quot;<br />
<br />
She could sense the person behind the door hesitating.  She could almost taste the fear in the air.  Oddly, it seemed to excite her.<br />
<br />
Finally, the voice quietly asked, &quot;Mary, is that you? I&#39;ve had an accident, and I need your help. Will you help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice was infuriating, but the fear was too delicious to resist.  She now desperately needed to get inside.  Mary did her best to sound like her old self, and replied &quot;Of course, Brittany. I would be happy to help, my friend. Just open the door, and let me in.&quot;<br />
<br />
With maddeningly slow speed, the door opened, and Mary was stunned by the strange creature before her.</p>
