<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time he had gotten home, and was able to make a decent effort to push against the dream-like state he was in, Edgar was aware that his boobs were bigger. Shucking off his work shirt and slacks, he stood in his bedroom, staring in the full-body mirror at his reflection, thinking the cups on his bra were filled more. Removing the bra as he thought about what to wear for the casual dinner he stared at his chest for a moment before going to fetch a cloth measuring tape. Wrapping it first around his breasts as if he&#39;d done such a thing before, then the area below, he did a few more calculations and such before confirming what he not only suspected, but his mind assured him he knew to be true.<br />
<br />
Troubled by the fact that his tits were bigger, and that he could remember them being a B cup, plus that they had looked so, he set aside the tape measure. Gazing at his reflection, thinking that the only thing that had changed was the size of his breasts, it suddenly came to him what he was looking at. Staring at the mirror, wondering where it had come from, he turned away and reaching for a robe, he pulled it on and tied it shut as he peered at his room a moment before striding out.<br />
<br />
Minutes later he was back and as he sat on the bed, he thought about going to knock on Abby&#39;s bedroom door to see if the girl was home yet. Thinking on how his apartment now looked like a woman occupied it, with feminine hygiene products now in the bathroom, fresh flowers on the table, soft feminine-coloured pillows on the couch, whilst his bedroom had, besides the mirror, a vanity, among other feminine touches not only in the room he slept, but throughout the apartment, Edgar found himself torn between liking everything and upset that his and Abby&#39;s apartment had been altered. Having not expected such a thing, he lay back and again questioned his idea of revenge and how things seemed to be spiralling beyond anything he&#39;d expected and could control.<br />
<br />
Wanting more then ever to talk with Abby, Edgar rolled over on his side and curled up. Feeling the soft fabric of his robe brushing against his boobs, he sighed, sat up and, instead of going to see if Abby was home, he stood and shucked off his robe. Leaving it hang on the back of the closet door, he looked through the women&#39;s garments now hanging up and after a bit selected a dress that buttoned up in the front with thin shoulder straps. Knowing it would hug his body to accent all the right areas, was somewhere between being casual and appropriate for something fancy, and that it would come down to just a little ways past his knees, he headed back to the mirror. Modelling it in front of him by holding it pressed against his body, liking how soft the cotton fabric felt, feeling the dream-like state starting to return, he decided that a bandeau-style bra would work and a pair of slip-on, strappy, low-heel shoes.<br />
<br />
Some time later, dressed, smelling nice, a touch of make-up added to help accent his femininity, Edgar once against stood before the mirror. He had been worried that with his B cup size tits the dress would look ridiculous in the chest area, but seeing how it hugged his body, he was relieved and thought the bra with its titbit of padding helped. Grabbing a purse that went with the dress and the shoes, he slipped his man-size feet in the shoes, disappointed that they still hadn&#39;t changed, but glad that they fit in the smaller sized shoes. Taking another look in the mirror, he smiled shyly upon seeing the pretty woman reflected back and thinking, &quot;This is who I am becoming,&quot; he again questioned the plan as he thought about the Amulet of Zulo, which was inside a jewellery box on top of his dresser.<br />
<br />
Again, he felt like he should go and see if Abby was home and ask her for her take on what was happening. Thinking it odd that he hadn&#39;t seen the other girl since he&#39;d got home, he turned away from the mirror and was about to go knock on the girl&#39;s bedroom door, but was distracted when he heard someone knocking on the apartment front door. Figuring his questions would have to wait, he changed course and headed for the front door.<br />
<br />
Low-heeled shoes made a sharp, but pleasant, report on first the carpet then linoleum floor, Edgar suddenly found himself feeling shy and rather nervous when he opened the door and found Ted waiting. Thinking, &quot;Cute,&quot; and, &quot;Suiting,&quot; as he studied the jeans, tank top and open button-up the man was wearing, Edgar breathed in the hint of the guy&#39;s cologne as it mixed nicely with the perfume he had on. Fiddling with his purse, wondering if he should say something or invite the man in, the dream-like state growing stronger as he felt it continue to slip over him, he listened as Ted said, &quot;Uh, hi. You look very nice. Pretty. Beautiful,&quot; before taking deep breath and asking, &quot;I&#39;m not early, am I?&quot; as he shifted in place.<br />
<br />
Still finding the man&#39;s nervousness adorable, and that it made him even cuter, Edgar shook his head commented, &quot;You&#39;re right on time,&quot; and making a motion, he asked, &quot;Would you like to come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can, if you like,&quot; Ted replied, then added, &quot;But, if you rather, we can go right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lost to the dream-like state, shyness and feeling girly, Edgar nodded and extended his hand. As Ted took it, everything seemed to swirl and liking the feeling of the guy&#39;s hand against the soft skin of his hand, Edgar wondered briefly, &quot;Why are my hands still the same,&quot; before allowing himself to be escorted out of the apartment, downstairs and to Ted&#39;s waiting car.<br />
<br />
Everything passed in a rush as Ted took him to dinner, then dancing at a couple clubs. The evening ending with them sharing a kiss that Edgar found enjoyable, they then arranged for their next date and exchanged numbers in case something came up. Afterward, standing in the shower, Edgar reflected on the evening as the dream-like state once again left him, noting that, when they had talked about their lives, the details Edgar had given were about growing up as Roni. Feeling the need more than ever to talk with Abby, he finished and stepped out of the shower.<br />
<br />
The mirror in the bathroom showing him that he looked even more like a woman, Edgar reached for a towel. Starting to dry himself, Edgar noted that though he still had the same gangly height, his body structure was looking more and more feminine. His pronounced hips and butt, the fact that his boobs had stopped growing and where now a C cup, the diminished muscle, not that he had much to begin with, and how his face looked, accented nicely by the shoulder-length hair that was black with a red tinge, left him feeling like he was looking at a young woman. Sourly, he noted the only thing off were a few things here and there, like his hands and feet, his height, his weight he guessed, and the fact that he still had a dick and ball sack. Tossing the towel into a nearby hamper, he ran another through his hair to dry it before it too joined the first. Exiting the bathroom, he headed toward his bedroom, noting as he did that the way he walked wasn&#39;t how he had done so as a guy.<br />
<br />
After he&#39;d collected and pulled on his robe, disturbed by how nice the soft fabric felt as brushed against his skin, and that he liked it, Edgar headed for Abby&#39;s room. Knocking on the door, he called, &quot;We probably should have done this when I got home, but we definitely need to talk,&quot; and pushing open the door and flicking on the light, Edgar stopped and stared in shock.<br />
<br />
No longer decorated as if someone occupied it, the room contained only a few storage containers. Taking a few steps backwards, swearing, &quot;Shit, shit, shit, shit,&quot; he had a brief flash of terror as he wondered if what had been done had somehow made Abby disappear. Finding such a thought ridiculous, he flipped off the light and exited the room. Troubled, realising that he could no longer remember Abby being either his friend, let alone flatmate, he drifted back to his bedroom. Flopping down on the bed, he found it difficult to grasp, to believe, what he&#39;d seen and what his mind insisted was true. Finding it too problematic, especially as he felt it was something he needed to do something about, Edgar looked over at that the jewellery box, thought about the Amulet of Zulo, then gazed down at the swell of chest, finding it was something else that had to get used to, yet, at the same time, finding it was difficult to wrap his mind around the fact that he now had tits.</p>
