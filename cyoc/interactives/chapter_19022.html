<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian Walker walked in front of the column of students leaving the bus.  As the teachers filed them through the ticket counter he simply walked off knowing that the teachers would be concentrating on the back of the line.<br />
<br />
You knew this trip to the zoo was going to be lame the moment you heard about it the week before.  The two hours of parental permission slips, signed pledges, and waiting to get on the bus for no apparent reason all resulted in arriving well after feeding time.  Now the animals were all dozing off, showing little interest in anything, let alone each other.  Maybe they planned it this way so they wouldn't have to teach sex education again.<br />
<br />
It would be hours before anyone noticed you were missing, one of the perks and unfortunate consequences of being quiet and well behaved.  You pass a sign pointing to the aquarium and remember that they feed the otters in the aternoon to entertain the zoo goers.  Might as well watch an animal do something, you increase your pace as a security gaurd is about to escort you back to your class.  &quot;Too close to lunch break to deal with parents and teachers for the next twenty minutes&quot; you say congradulating yourself.<br />
<br />
Looks like you came too early, some otters are swimming around but there's no evidence of them having been fed lately.  Might as well just sit and watch them for a while, it beats marching to every lame animal joke you've heard since kindergarten.  The otter pond has a water level window, but all the benches are up top on the less popular above ground viewing area.  You find a bench facing away from the rail, allowing you to comfortably kneel and rest your arms on the thick metal railing while getting a good view of the whole otter pond.  At least the rail isn't too hot yet.  <br />
<br />
There's some kind of loud speaker announcement calling for security at the lion den but it's so garbled you barely even notice.  &quot;I hope they haven't thought I was kidnapped or anything&quot;, you silently curse yourself for underestimating your teachers' capacity to panic.  &quot;No, they would've called my name first, I would've recognized that, besides, no one would think too much if I told them I just got a little lost.&quot; It's getting a little hot and you press your front against the back of the bench.  &quot;Dain, it really got hot all of a sudden&quot;, you say as you hold onto the rails and rub yourself against the wooden backing of the park bench.  <br />
<br />
There's about four otters in the water and you envy them for being able to cool off.  There's three in particular that you find very interesting to watch as you start sliding yourself up and down against the wood back supports.  You feel an upward erection, but a casual look down shows that your shorts don't look noticably different from the outside.  One of the otters is now swimming slowly on its back and staring up at you.  Without thinking you take off your shirt, socks, and sandals and cannonball into the pool.<br />
<br />
The water was just deep enough tokeep you from hurting yourself when you hit the bottom.  You're stunned for a second but head up for air to see the otter at eye level.  She takes off swimming, you admire her graceful curves and agility a second before swimming after her.  You don't swim like an otter nearly as well as she does, and as if to rub it in your face, swims a circle around you before sliding up between your legs and swishing her tail into your eyes.  You lower your shorts and swim towards her on the far side of the pool.  You can't force her to come to you, but presenting your sleek new otter cock you do your best to glide through the water and appear dominant.<br />
<br />
Tapping on the glass only makes you slightly aware of shouts from people.  You swim against the female's body and she elegantly weaves through yours, revealing glimpses of bright red beneath her tail.  You swim beneath her and raise her out of the water on your belly.  Gently cusping the rear of her oily body you slide her onto your otter size cock and gently but rapidly thrust.  You feel her tail curve around touch a mound growing out above your butt.  You feel your mate getting bigger as your shorts float off your shortening legs.  You increase the force of your thrusts as you shrink into the size of your cock, and suddenly find it possible to grab her thick tail with your feet and rub her head with your neck.  Your eyes meet, but your shock is dissipated by her licking your wet nose and growing whiskers.<br />
<br />
Her heavy panting marks the beginning of her climax and you go full force into her cunt.  You use your tail to flip yourselves over and push her against the window, you find it odd that you can't touch the floor of the pool anymore but the force of your tail driving yourself into the female is more than sufficient to keep you above water.  <br />
<br />
In all too short a time you both wear out and your playful mate swims up and out between your short arms, leaving you doing a well deserved dead man's float.  You recognize Ty and some other clasmates staring at you through the window, while you also see the reflection of an oversexed otter staring staring back at you.  <br />
<br />
Now a full otter, but with your same mind, you realize what you've just done.  You want to swim away and be a boy again but you're still too tired from your aquatic mating to do much of anything.  Your nose twitches and you smell something, food, by only slight movemnets in your body you glide to where a zooworkeer is exiting a door with a bucket of fish and clams.  Your female barks as another gets close to you, &quot;maybe this won't be so bad after all&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Dain it, it looks like we got ourselves another one over here.  There should only be one male otter, so get the otter noose and search the files for identifying marks on the male that isn't a pubescent teeenager&quot;.<br />
<br />
'click'<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry sir, I'm over at the wolf den trying to unite some stupid wolf kid, you'll just have to let them have at each other for a while longer&quot;.<br />
<br />
'click'<br />
<br />
&quot;Jimmy, get over here and help me rope this zebra, he's running full speed with the grace of a colt and he's going to get me killed!&quot;<br />
<br />
'click'<br />
<br />
&quot;It's quite literally your lucky day kid, there's enough in this bucket for all of you but don't eat too much before fucking again, you'll have to not drown yourself until we can round up the rest of your buddies&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tossing the bucket's contents into the pool made it possible for all of us to eat without having to fight or perform tricks.  The two females from before swim by, brushing you on either side.  Stunning even youself, you do an instant 180 and chase them at full speed.  You may be a human, but you're also a young male otter with two females in need of servicing.  This trip to the zoo isn't nearly so boring afterall.</p>
