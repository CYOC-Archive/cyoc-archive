<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake lay in bed for a minute, trying to catch his breath. He looked down at his hands and stomach covered in cum, his cock still rock hard. He couldn’t remember ever experiencing an orgasm that powerful before, but he was still horny as hell and more than ready for round two. Pushing himself up off the bed, he took a quick minute to study his reflection in the dresser mirror. <br />
<br />
Jake was known as the bad boy in his group of friends, and with good reason; he’d dropped out of school at the age of sixteen and had started selling drugs and any other illegal paraphernalia he could get his hands on. Now in his late twenties, Jake had short dark brown hair and hard, masculine features; his dark piercing eyes could instill both fear and desire, depending on what his intentions were. He had four piercings: both of his nipples had a spike sticking out of them, a small silver ring looped through his left eyebrow and he had a stud in his tongue. His right arm was covered in a sleeve tattoo, and he had plans to extend the design across his chest and onto his other arm. He stood at a little over 6’ tall and was broad, with the shoulders of a linebacker.<br />
<br />
He crossed the room and rifled through Paulo’s closet, looking for something he could wear. There weren’t a ton of options, but he was able to find a pair of baggy jeans he could slip on and a grey v-neck shirt. The shirt was tight, definitely a size too small for him, but Jake didn’t mind; it showed off his muscles and accentuated his cobbled abs. After throwing a quick handful of product through his hair, he was ready to hit the town.<br />
<br />
Jake decided his best bet at this hour was to check out one of the local gay bars in the area. It was getting close to closing time, and he was sure he could find someone desperate not to go home alone. It was slow at the bar that night; he approached the counter and ordered a beer, surveying his options. He quickly noticed one of the patrons was glancing over at him, trying not to stare. He smirked; target acquired.<br />
<br />
Not in the mood to play games, Jake walked right over to the other man, a young skinny guy who looked like he’d be afraid of his own shadow. The man’s eyes widened as Jake approached, as if he thought Jake was about to deck him.<br />
<br />
“Hey man, how’s it going?” Jake asked with a head nod, flashing a smile and turning on the charm. <br />
<br />
“Oh, uh, hi,” The other man muttered nervously, biting his lower lip as he looked down to the floor.<br />
<br />
“I’m Jake.”<br />
<br />
“I’m, uh… Bobby.”<br />
<br />
“You here with anyone, Bobby?” Jake asked, trying to not let his impatience show. He really wasn’t looking for a conversation or a friend; he just needed a good fuck. Bobby was not Jake’s usual type, as he usually preferred rougher, masculine men more like himself, but the raging boner in Jake’s jeans was begging for release. <br />
<br />
Bobby shook his head, still looking downwards and avoiding eye contact. He had spiky blonde hair that he obviously bleached with soft, almost feminine features and sparkling blue eyes. He was dressed in a dark pink sweater and skinny jeans with a rainbow belt. Jake had to admit that he was cute, even if he wasn’t what he looked for in a man.<br />
<br />
“Well, do you want to get out of here, then?” Jake asked, reaching out and gently touching Bobby’s shoulder. For the first time, Bobby looked up and their eyes met; Bobby grinned and nodded yes vigorously. Without another word, Jake took Bobby by the hand and led him out of the bar.<br />
<br />
By the time they reached Bobby’s apartment, Jake was so horny he was afraid he would blow his load before they even had a chance to have sex. After entering Bobby’s bedroom, the men quickly started tearing off each other’s clothes until they were both naked. Bobby’s cock was below average, only around three inches long, but Jake was much more interested in the man’s tight, round butt. Lubing himself up, Jake slowly slid his finger into Bobby’s asshole to loosen the other man, eliciting a moan from Bobby.<br />
<br />
Jake slid the condom up his thick, large cock and gently bent Bobby over his bed. He slowly slid inside Bobby, pushing further and further in until he was balls deep. After confirming that Bobby was okay, Jake started thrusting his dick in and out of Bobby’s ass. Bobby was whimpering in pleasure at the feeling of Jake’s penetration. Jake had the biggest dick he’d ever taken, and it was almost too much for him to handle. After a few minutes, the pressure in Bobby’s ass started to diminish; it felt like Jake wasn’t thrusting in as far as he could go.<br />
<br />
“You can go all the way in, Jake,” Bobby panted, “I can handle it.”<br />
<br />
“I am thrusting all the way in,” Jake replied. Bobby was surprised by the sound of Jake’s voice. They’d only spoken a few words to each other, but he could’ve sworn that Jake’s voice had been deeper at the bar. Now he sounded a bit softer and less manly.<br />
<br />
Jake could feel the intensity increase, and he knew he was getting close to erupting. He was so overcome by his euphoria that he hadn’t noticed the changes he was going through. Since he had started fucking Bobby, Jake had lost almost a foot of height, and his muscles were dwindling away. His massive biceps and veiny forearms slowly dissipated, becoming lanky and scrawny. His broad shoulders were also slimming down, leaving Jake with a leaner build.<br />
<br />
As Jake continued to change, it was becoming more difficult to thrust into Bobby. His massive member was growing shorter and thinner, inch after inch shrinking away as his balls shrivelled up to a fraction of their former size. Jake’s tight, firm ass started to round out and inflate into the perfect bubble butt. His thick muscled thighs and calves slenderized as well, leaving him with a pair of defined but dainty legs.<br />
<br />
“Is something wrong?” Bobby asked, trying to look over his shoulder at Jake. He could barely feel the other man’s dick anymore; it felt like a small hard knub was thrusting up against his ass instead of fucking him at this point. <br />
<br />
“I’m so fucking close,” Jake whined. Bobby was now sure that Jake didn’t sound anything at all like he had when they first met. Jake actually was sounding a lot like Bobby.<br />
<br />
Bobby stood up and pushed Jake off him. He’d expected the other man would be able to overpower him but found it surprisingly easy to push Jake backwards. He spun around to face Jake, shocked at what he saw. The large, muscled hunk that Jake had been mere moments before was quickly turning into the body of a twink. Jake had towered over Bobby, but they were now the same height, and Jake was barely more muscular. Even as Bobby watched on, Jake’s defined pecs were fading away into a flatter, more boyish chest. His abs smoothed over into a flat tummy as Jake jerked off his greatly diminished manhood.<br />
<br />
“FUUCCKKK,” Jake cried, his dick squirting out a few pathetic ropes of cum. Jake’s square jaw rounded out as his features grew softer, more delicate. His stubble receded back into his chin, leaving him clean shaven. His piercings retracted into his body as his tattoos faded away. His chest, leg and arm hair vanished as well, leaving Jake smooth except for the pubes around his cock which lightened from dark brown to blonde. Jake’s hair brightened and spiked up, mimicking Bobby’s hairstyle.<br />
<br />
Jake slowly opened his eyes as he came down from his orgasm. His dark, piercing eyes were gone, replaced with a bright blue. Jake felt his mind grow fuzzy as he collapsed onto the bed, his memories and personality being overwritten with Bobby’s.<br />
<br />
Bobby couldn’t believe his eyes. All traces of Jake were gone; he was now staring at a perfect replica of himself.</p>
