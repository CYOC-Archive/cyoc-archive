<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The recently instated &quot;Janet&quot; began cleaning the house as his &quot;mother&quot; had ordered him to.<br />
Jim/Janet thought to himself &quot;why would she throw the ring down the sink….Did she really <br />
want to stay this way?&quot; <br />
<br />
I better start cleaning the house before she comes back or worse begins telling people...<br />
<br />
Cleaning the house was not an easy task Jim/Janet soon realized cleaning up after his <br />
brother was no easy task..once the dishes were done, floor swept,laundry completed, <br />
Jim/Janet checked the clock on the microwave in the kitchen 9:30pm  and sat down at the <br />
kitchen table for a breather<br />
<br />
Jim thought to himself 4 hours of cleaning was hard work but yet…slightly soothing&quot;..<br />
 he definitely had a new appreciation for what his mother had done everyday for <br />
years…..&quot;now this may be my job forever..&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
His train of thought was broken when Janet/Jim entered the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;i know this is not really your kind of cake cleaning up after everyone..&quot;  Janet/Jim said to <br />
him. <br />
Janet/Jim proceed to the sink that was across from him<br />
<br />
&quot;its not bad for the first time cleaning the house tho..<br />
she paused looking around at his work and stopped at the dish drying rack……&quot;but you <br />
could do a little better on the dishes next time&quot; she pointed at a smudge on the salad bowl <br />
he had washed earlier.<br />
 &quot;but def passable&quot;…..She finished<br />
<br />
&quot;thanks&quot; i replied. feeling slightly better about myself.<br />
<br />
Mind if i take a seat? she asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure&quot; i replied. <br />
It was a weird feeling to be staring at my self across the kitchen table which just hours ago <br />
i had done so for the first time..<br />
<br />
&quot;I think i know what you are going through &quot;mom&quot; she said as she winked at me<br />
<br />
&quot;what do you mean by that? i asked her not knowing where she was going with this.<br />
<br />
&quot;well for instance when i was younger&quot; She began<br />
&quot;I to felt a little different..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Different?&quot; i asked her &quot;what do you mean?'<br />
<br />
&quot;well For instance i was not really into the girly girl stuff when i was a child. i wanted to <br />
play football and hockey with the boys in the neighborhood but quickly realized my body <br />
wasn't really men't for those kinds of sports so instead i joined the track team as it turned <br />
out i was rather decent at the longer distant events.&quot; <br />
<br />
Really? i said slightly intrigued…<br />
<br />
&quot;yep really ha ha&quot; she chuckled at herself<br />
&quot;Made it to regionals to you should check the athletic awards room at your school. i broke <br />
a few school records in my days&quot;. but point being i realized all throughout high school and <br />
university that i was in the wrong body i was attracted to men but just did not like my <br />
body ever since i was really young i always wished i could wake up and be in a boys body <br />
kinda similar to what i think your going though except your not wishing to be a boy…&quot; she <br />
paused looking at me her left eyebrow raising slightly.<br />
<br />
she had me pinned. i was not really sure but i knew she was right ever since i was young i <br />
had always wished the same thing…i go to school or to the mall or even to the grocery <br />
store and every girl i see i envy…not in lust but more in a way of longing to be that girl. <br />
Wishing i could wear the clothes they are wearing, walk and talk the way they are, go to <br />
ballet class, go to girl slumber party's and paint each others toes. But at the end of the day <br />
when i leave school…the mall..or the grocery store…i have an empty feeling in my <br />
stomach and over time i began to get depressed. started to feel really low at how unfair life <br />
is and that we didn't have the choice at a young age or have control over our own sex <br />
during the 1st trimester…<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim&quot; i said (it felt slightly awkward to say that) what does that mean? i think i know what <br />
your talking about. i feel the same way and always have….&quot;. <br />
It was so hard for me to admit that to my mother i never have and didn't think i would for <br />
a long time.  i know felt almost like a brick was removed from inside my head and there <br />
was less pressure on me. <br />
there was a slight silence in the room. i did not know my mother felt this way about <br />
herself…it would explain why she never liked keeping her work clothes on at the end of <br />
the day…..<br />
<br />
&quot;so what does this mean now? i asked &quot;Him&quot; looking at Jim/Janet<br />
<br />
&quot;well &quot;mom&quot; she bagman looking at me <br />
&quot;this is quite an interesting scenario we have before us. the thing we have to decide on now <br />
is what to do. we basically have 3 options….we could switch back, as i did NOT throw the <br />
ring away that would be reckless.&quot;  the second choice would be to live our lives as each <br />
other through better or worse….&quot; she paused<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats the 3rd choice?&quot; i asked knowing that i wanted choice number 2….<br />
<br />
&quot;well&quot; choice number 3&quot; she began&quot; would be we switch back and i would live my life in my <br />
real body and complete my life as a woman, and you would of course have to switch  back <br />
as well…but being that you have just opened up to me about being transgendered your <br />
father and i would get you the help you need to begin transition to becoming the person <br />
you want to be and if your up to it and really want to we will pull together the money for <br />
your sex change procedures and operation.&quot; its up to you. she finished. <br />
she looked across from me full knowing what i decide could possibly effect her life in a <br />
way she wants or doesn't want….<br />
<br />
i thought to myself wow. &quot;i have 3  opportunities in front of me but what one..</p>
