<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about this new costume shop that opened up just recently?&quot; Suggested Krista. <br />
<br />
Marin didn&#39;t quite get what Krista was talking about. &quot;A costume shop? Like for Halloween and such?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, something like that, but this one is more for cosplayers, then just Halloween. Although they should be selling a ton of those things too. Of course we don&#39;t have to buy anything, but I think it would be a lot of fun if we spent the day just trying on various costumes and showing off to each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure I&#39;m in. Sounds interesting&quot; Clarice said, which meant that Brie would be not only be agreeing as well, but likely would be recieving some kind of &quot;special&quot; costumes from Clarice, or magic of some kind. Either way, Brie had a suspicion her own experience would be very different from the rest of them. And like before, she found herself somewhat looking forward to what was being secretly planned for her. It seems that Clarice&#39;s training really was warping her mind ever so slightly with each additional session they had with each other. It made her curious about how depraved she will end up being by the time their bet ends. Would she be living completely as Brie 100% of the time? Would she even have a dick? Hell, would she even be human? Even that last thought would not be too surprising if it turned out to be the case. The entire world saw her as a simple pet animal just a few days ago afterall.<br />
<br />
The shop was actually just a short walk from the cafe. However their group had gotten quite a lot of looks from other people, specifically Brie. It wasn&#39;t uncommon for girls to go shopping together with a single guy friend, but it wasn&#39;t as common for 2 of the girls to be dressed in just casual outdoor clothes and sneakers, while the youngest looking one of them all was in a dress and 5&quot; heels. Brie also coincidentally had the largest boobs too, so that just added to the reasons why she stood out most. <br />
<br />
About 2 minutes into their walk to the store. Clarice said she was gonna make a stop at a nearby store real quick, and Marin went with her, leaving Brie and Krista behind because Claricesaid it was goingto be a surprise for Brie. <br />
<br />
As the 2 of them waited outside, Krista no longer could keep her curiosity to herself. &quot;Hey Brie, why, or I guess maybe what, made you decide to wear such tall heels todag? Don&#39;t they hurt your feet after a while? It isn&#39;t like some event or something was going on, and Clarice isn&#39;t even nearly as dressed up as you are. Not that there is anything wrong with it. The look suits you, like almost too well even. I am just curious is all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well...&quot; Brie was a bit flustered with the question. Even she agreed that it was like her body was just made to be in a dress with heels. And she couldn&#39;t say it was because she use to crossdress so much in heels, that she had grown really fond of how they felt, and never really had to deal with too much pain for some reason. Plus she liked being complimented. &quot;Thank you for saying that. Uh, let&#39;s see. I guess the best answer is that I just like wearing them. They feel comfortable to me, and it isn&#39;t like they limit my mobility at all. As for foot pain, I&#39;m sorry, but I never really have experience it, I guess. I know many women complain about how after spending many hours in heels, it causes their feet to hurt a lot, but I personally can&#39;t say that I have ever experienced what they describe. So I guess because of that, I have come to really love being in high heels whenever I need to be wearing some kind of footwear. Actually, that may be why I like to wear dresses a lot too. They just look great when worn with a cute pair of heels.&quot; This was actually Brie&#39;s honest opinion. As a crossdresser who loved women&#39;s clothing, she actually took her outfit choices seriously. And now with a 99% female body, she could actually wear the clothing properly, once Clarice adjusted it to fit her size that is. &quot;Actually I am also kind of interested in why you prefer to look like a guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s an easy one. There are 2 reasons. The first is that I can pull it off really well, which has allowed me to expand my cosplaying hobby capabilities and scope tremendously. And the second is that by doing so, me and Marin don&#39;t get hit on when we go out shopping. You and Clarice are also benefiting from my implied manliness now too. Kind of convenient, right? I bet the both of you must attract hordes of annoying people trying to just get inside of your panties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well... I guess you could say that it gets pretty annoying sometimes. Even when I am not just out by myself, I usually have a few people still try and hit on either me or Clarice&quot; lied Brie. This was her first time out in public as a girl besides when she was Clarice&#39;s pet. However in just an hour, she had been asked out almost 10 times, and had been given 2 free coffees. So saying she was completely unaware of what happens was also untrue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly. But with me here, everyone assumes you are all part of my harem or something, and leaves us alone. It&#39;s super convenient.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they continued to chat, Clarice and Marin returned from the shop and while Brie wasn&#39;t looking, Clarice put a large, black sun hat on her head. &quot;There we go, now you have a hat to wear.&quot; Is what she said outloud, but what Brie heard inside her head was. &quot;Just accept it. Since I said you were my girlfriend and all, I need to make sure to keep up the illusion and act like it&#39;s true to an extent. And before you ask no, I didn&#39;t mess with it in any way. So just say thanks and then we can move on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brie was initially somewhat touched by the gesture, but that idea broke immediately once Clarice explained her actions. &quot;So she wants me to keep up the act? Then I guess this should be more than an acceptable response&quot; she thought to herself, hoping to score a bit of payback for the rude comment. Acting quickly to make sure she caught her off guard, Brie grabbed Clarice&#39;s hand after she had just turned back around. Clarice turned back to see what Brie needed when she was suddenly kissed on her lips, with Brie&#39;s tongue slipping into her mouth for a moment. This completely startled her, which caused her to freeze up for a second. Her stunned expression was exactly what Brie was aiming for, as she began to laugh at her. &quot;Holy shit she actually got one over me&quot; thought Clarice. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Brie was also internally freaking out. &quot;WHY THE HELL DID I USE MY TONGUE!!! I only wanted a quick kiss, not a full on french kiss. My body just acted on its own. Seriously, please don&#39;t tell me my body is moving on partial autopilot now...&quot; <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t. But Brie didn&#39;t know that. What actually happened was she actually just did it on impusle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh that was kinda hot!&quot; Interjected Marin, who had been watching the entire time. &quot;I didn&#39;t take you as being the one who takes the initiations Brie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I ususally am not, but I will say that it was kinda exciting&quot; Brie lied. She hated it. She disliked Clarice&#39;s antics, and would never want to actually kiss her. Or so she hoped. Even now she was somewhat in doubt though. <br />
<br />
They walked and talked for a bit more until the reached the costume shop. Entering it, they decided to pick out a costume for one of the other members. Clarice would pick for Krista, who would pick Marin, who would pick Brie, who would pick for Clarice. They all had 15 minutes to pick out something, and went their seperate ways.<br />
<br />
After the time limit ended, they met back up near the dressing rooms and handed eachother their respective costumes which they all had hidden inside of paper bags. Brie entered the stall and opened her bag, her costume was...</p>
