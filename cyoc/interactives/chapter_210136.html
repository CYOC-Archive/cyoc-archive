<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">9:00 rolled around soon enough in English, with the sound of the school bells heralding the start of school half an hour ago at 8:30 A.M.<br />
<br />
The transformed boy/conjoined bus twins were not in any of Jen&#39;s classes, she presumed this was because they were probably in advanced ones.  They had hopped off the bus lightly with their cat paws in their tennis shoes, and had made their way to class both sipping from a Starbucks latte as the boy extended his tongue to steal some of the cream.<br />
<br />
Jen sat in the back of the class for English, and despite liking the teacher and the class in general, she could never seem to write a good essay - the back of the class was a prime place to cheat.<br />
<br />
Jen made sure no one was watching when she slipped her next pill into the water bottle of the girl on her right - she was texting and did not have a faintest clue of her surroundings.  Then, she waited for the spectacle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The girl did not even look up from her phone, and forgot the water bottle at the end of class.  Jen had to tap her on the shoulder and hand it to her before she realized.<br />
<br />
She went outside only to chuck it in the trash.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not wanting to have to eat a pill herself, Jen went to the trash can, which was thankfully, almost brand new, and fished out the water bottle.  Thoughtfully cleaning it with some hand sanitizer, she made her way to her French class, and when she arrived, gifted the water bottle to her teacher - a kind, at least 80-year-old woman (still unmarried) who was sweet, but got dry and boring sometimes.<br />
<br />
As French was one of the only classes Jen was good at, she decided to try and give her teacher a bit of thanks.  Needless to say, it worked.<br />
<br />
In a 4 minute process which Jen secretly recorded from under her desk, the grandma of her teacher transformed into a young, supple, and cheery centaur - her teacher&#39;s back first snapped straight with a crack, before she slowly got taller with each step she took around the board, not needing to strain with her ruler to point things out any longer.  With each breath she took, each white hair turned grey, then black, and each wrinkle and liver spot began to shrink, fade, and vanish.<br />
<br />
In about 2 minutes, Jen&#39;s French teacher was a supple young woman who glided around the class in a bright blue dress, keeping every guy and girl awake.  Whether it was the new demeanor, the new sex appeal, or the clothing, Jen had no clue.<br />
<br />
Jen was a bit disappointed that no other changes occurred, but in 10 seconds, all her worries were dispelled as her teacher&#39;s arms split at the elbows, giving her two hands and two lower arms per arm.  Two new brown tufts of fur grew in behind Jen&#39;s teacher&#39;s ears as they lengthened, pointed, and tapered into two horse&#39;s ears, swiveling around to catch students&#39; questions and answers, and her legs slowly darkened and became equine as they elongated.  <br />
<br />
The class, oblivious to the eldritch insanity occurring in front of them, failed to see the horse legs turn a rich chocolate brown before splitting - the teacher&#39;s behind expanded and stretched as a horse&#39;s torso was created.<br />
<br />
Within the next minute or so, Jen&#39;s teacher was a full-blown centaur, her feet having hardened into hooves, and her new horse&#39;s rear growing a long, black tail.<br />
<br />
But, that wasn&#39;t it though.<br />
<br />
The centaur body feminized a bit, making both the hips of the frontal and back horse legs wider, and the legs more curvy and humanly feminine.  The horse part&#39;s behind plumped up to form large, bouncy, human-like buttocks which swayed in tandem with the French teacher&#39;s C-cup breasts.  The dress she wore elongated though, with the changing reality, to cover the horse ass, if only slightly.  Two special jeans, one for the front pair of horse legs, and one for the back, also appeared.<br />
<br />
The teacher&#39;s anus and vagina had relocated themselves to where they would usually be on a horse, both enlarging and puffing up but not turning into those of a horse.<br />
<br />
Jen saw one last, curious thing as her teacher wielded two markers at once with her right arm, writing two sentences with each hand and lower arm which the class was eager to write down - a curious large bulge in her teacher&#39;s horse belly.<br />
<br />
The question of what it was answered when 3 minutes later, an odd creature clambered out of her teacher&#39;s vagina, pointed rearward, covered in slime.  What shocked and scared Jen did not seem to unsettle the class.  Looking around for just a second to see any possible reaction, Jen looked back and was shocked to see the creature in its full form, fully clothed.<br />
<br />
Her teacher never got married, and thus never had children, which she always regretted.  In a way, this creature could be her . . . &quot;child.&quot;<br />
It would seem that all the strangeness of the usual transformation had manifested in this being.<br />
<br />
It was obviously somewhat female, having three F-Cup breasts, each with a 3 inch flaccid penis, testicles and all, attached to it, where the nipple should have been, visible even under the small puffer jacket it was wearing.  It walked on long legs attached to where its arms should be, seemingly perpetually in tippy-toes.  It had two long arms where its legs should be, which it used to carry papers around to students.<br />
<br />
Between the arms, where the vagina should be, was a large mouth signified by a plump pair of lips.  The mouth smiled as the creature spoke crisply, saying &quot;you&#39;re welcome!&quot; to a thanking student and congratulating another student.<br />
<br />
The creature had black hair tied in a ponytail atop an otherwise normal female head - with the exception of a nose and a mouth.  Eyeliner-applied eyes were still where eyes normally were, but in place of a nose and a mouth was a female vagina, clitoris and all, slightly glistening.  The creature adjusted the mask which could only cover the area beneath the clitoris, bending her lower torso upwards so that her hands could reach, the firm ass on the creature barely jiggling.<br />
<br />
Two noses were located on the creature on its temples, like little nubs of horns.<br />
<br />
The creature donned a navy blue shirt that said &quot;GAP&quot; on it in clear, large white letters which it partially covered with an unzipped puffer jacket with enlarged sleeves.  They wore jean shorts like the French teacher, with an opening for their mouth, and a rosy expression on both their face and their &quot;lower lips.&quot;<br />
<br />
The creature awkwardly made its way to Jen&#39;s French teacher, swinging its torso slightly, to say that all papers had been passed out.  They then &quot;tiptoed&quot; their way back to an office chair in which they sat with their legs resting on the arm rests, having taken their clogs off.   Then unwrapped a Tootsie Pop and sucked on it with their &quot;lower lips&quot; as they proceeded to grade and staple some more assignments. <br />
<br />
Jen discovered that the creature was indeed her teacher&#39;s daughter, who recently graduated and was just regularly coming by to help with her mom&#39;s class, by talking with some surrounding classmates during a 5-minute break in the middle of French class.<br />
<br />
How oddly wonderful, Jen thought.  She looked at the clock to discover, to her amazement, that only 17 minutes were left before she obtained her next pill.<br />
<br />
She scouted the class for potential next targets.</p>
