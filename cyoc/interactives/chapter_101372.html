<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anthony was looking big. He had transitioned into a full sized bodybuilder with ideal proportions and lean mass. His sleeveless shirt was now skintight on his frame, showing off the his bulging pecs and wide lats, his rounded shoulders and beefy traps. He almost looked ready to step onto a bodybuilding stage. <br />
<br />
Confident that the young man had grown large enough, Madame Illusia walked over.<br />
&quot;Anthony dear&quot; she began &quot;I think you&#39;re grown enough now.&quot; <br />
The young man was unresponsive, still too engrossed in consuming his shake to notice.<br />
&quot;Anthony!&quot; She repeated loudly, reaching over and gently pulling the protein shaker bottle down from his lips.  &quot;Anthony I think you&#39;re big enough for now.&quot; <br />
As the young man stopped chugging the shake a dazed looked stretched across his face. He looked around with a sense of wonderment, as if he were confused by his surroundings. He looked down at his powerfully muscular body and flexed his arms experimentally, admiring his new size.  He rubbed his hands across his beefy, rounded chest, amazed by the transformation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, how much did you weigh before you got up here young man?&quot; She asked, turning back to the audience. &quot;175 lbs&quot; he said, sounding a little shaken.  That weight had looked athletic and thin on his 5&#39;11&quot; frame. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well&quot; Madame began again. &quot;Lets see how much you&#39;re at now.&quot;  She gestured at Steven who brought over the large electric scale used earlier in her show. <br />
<br />
The now powerfully built bodybuilder gingerly stepped onto the scale. &quot;234.5 lbs!&quot; She read aloud. All of that was lean muscle too. Anthony seemed shocked by those numbers himself. Steve played with the scale a bit more and got the numbers to project onto the back wall in red letters so the audience could see.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So as you can see&quot; Madame Illusia turned to the crowd &quot;My protein shake really does work! It builds muscle like nothing you&#39;ve ever seen! So, Anthony could you do me a favor and fle...&quot; she began, turning back to Anthony. She was surprised to see him with his head tilted back, chugging the shake again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anthony!&quot; She yelled.  The young man was unresponsive. With each gulp the whole audience could watch as the numbers on the scale increased.  &quot;234.8...235.3...235.8...236.4....236...&quot;   This had members of the audience speaking excitedly to each other. The  young man was growing again. Anthony hadn&#39;t been able to resist the temptation of the muscle shake. <br />
<br />
Madame Illusia threw up her hands.  &quot;Well&quot; She began again &quot;If he wants to get bigger, I guess he&#39;ll get bigger!&quot; She said to the crowd.   &quot;Lets find something else to do. While Anthony off over there doing... that&quot; she gestured towards his side of the stage.  &quot;Let me figure out something else fun.&quot; <br />
<br />
Steven pulled forward with a few props. Madame Illusia took forward a red scarf and with a few gestures made the fabric change to a bright blue, then with a few spins  she transformed it into a quilt, quadrupling the size of the fabric in her hands. Despite her showmanship, the audience was distracted.<br />
<br />
In the corner of the stage the numbers on the readout steadily increased from 237lbs to over 255 lbs. Anthony&#39;s body was visibly growing in musculature. He was beginning to look like a serious heavyweight bodybuilder.  Each chug seemed to add almost a half pound of muscle across his frame.<br />
<br />
 Then Madame Illusia set aside the quilt she had produced and changed the color of her blouse, then changed Steve&#39;s pants into shorts while he stood there.  She made a few jokes to the audience about her fashion sense.  But nothing she did seemed to distract the crowd from the sideshow happening on her stage. Anthony was still standing in place on the scale, chugging away. <br />
<br />
261.2...262.6...263.... <br />
<br />
On an on the numbers on the readout went up.  Anthony continued to grow larger and larger. His biceps were now over 21&quot; around and growing round like bowling balls. His shoulders were massive and incredibly broad. He was turning into a super heavyweight bodybuilder in front of the whole crowd. His whole body unrecognizable, and even his face looked different, stronger, more masculine, with the incredibly thick neck he now had. His sleeveless shirt had begun to ride up over his  muscular stomach,showing off a thick set of cobblestone abs. Much of the fabric failed to contain his beefy chest and was beginning to tear apart.  The huge muscle man was going to be shirtless soon. <br />
<br />
Even his elastic shorts were straining over his bulging quads and massive muscle butt.  Anthony had to readjust his stance several times as he had grown since his muscular legs were now pressing against themselves. His solid and wide lats caused his right arm to stick out from his side as his left was holding the incredibly endless protein shake and dumping the contents into his hungry mouth.  The thought didn&#39;t really cross his mind, but his biceps had begun to press up against his rounded shoulders.  Anthony was getting so big it was beginning to get difficult to hold the pose he was in. <br />
<br />
Madame Illusia wasn&#39;t sure what to do. Clearly she had successfully grabbed the audience&#39;s attention, but not in the way she had anticipated...</p>
