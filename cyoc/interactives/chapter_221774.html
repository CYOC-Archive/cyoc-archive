<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Measuring Wyatt further reveals his perfect proportions<br />
<br />
Moth and the other boys are fascinated by how well-proportioned Wyatt is. “Well okay guys, I can understand you are curious about my body, it’s not like I seem to have many options, right?”<br />
<br />
Making the tiny teen stand up, Moth makes him lift his arms horizontally. “I want to measure your pecs”, He says with a weird smile. So using a measuring tape he founds out it was 7-3/4 inches.  Wyatt is not really comfortable being measured like that, but part of him enjoys being the centre of attraction even if it feels very weird. <br />
<br />
Chris seems very attentive to all details, odd for a guy who is homophobic and still fascinated by the shrunken teen anatomy. So he said. “What about his leg&#39;s length?” Moth makes him slightly spread his legs, which he does. But he got surprised and blushed when the giant teen had to put one edge of the measuring tape under his testicles to then extend the tape along his tiny leg. “5-1/4 inches.<br />
<br />
“What about his penis?” Giggles John<br />
<br />
“Soft or hard?” Mick said aloud, mockingly.<br />
<br />
“Hey stop it right now guys! What is that interest about my genitals?” Yells Wyatt very irritated.<br />
<br />
Mike is probably the less morally grounded guy in the group, even though that sort of power they all have over their shrunken play pal began to give him a semi-erection, which is not visible at that point. <br />
<br />
“Common tiny Wyatt, it’s just a game, no one will know besides us”, Mike said as, without any permission, put his index finger under the tiny penis to lift it horizontally the then measure it. “Not too bad, it’s 3/4 inch” But without very much shyness, he pinches it between his fingertip and thumb to milk it.<br />
<br />
Wyatt, very upset, tries to punch those invasive fingers away, even hitting them with his tiny fist. But Mike crabs the tiny man in his left fist and holds him firmly to have free access to the tiny genital he is masturbating.<br />
<br />
“Will you let him go on Chris? I thought you hate all those gay things!”, He said very angry and almost about to cry. <br />
<br />
Then Mike stops molesting Wyatt when he sees Chris’ disapproval look and said: “Hey look, he has an erection now, take your measurement and stop being sadistic.”<br />
<br />
Moth passes the measuring tape to Mike who dropped it when he began to sexually abuse Wyatt. The tiny guy was kicking and yelling insults, but his uncut and thick erected dick was a good 1-1/4 inch long. <br />
<br />
“What now, no one had bet money on my dick size too? You say we are friends and all you did so far is humiliate me and have fun with me even if I&#39;m not willing, how can you? I want to grow back and have my clothes! I have an erection, so what! Are you happy now you bunch of perverts!”<br />
<br />
John is feeling very bad and said: “I think, guys, we went way too far with him.” Then he gives the tiny man one of his clothes, red athleticism shorts actually. Wyatt is not sure what to think about it, it could be another trick or something. But he takes it and covers his nudity. <br />
<br />
“We sure got carried away with the intoxication of having a tiny guy to play with.”, Said Chris. But he does not understand what was happening in their minds and why no one seem to be able to resist touching the tiny teen. From his part, Wyatt began to come back to a more logical state of mind, analyzing his new situation. So he said:<br />
<br />
“Listen up guys, it’s not being touched I hate the most, it’s that you do it without my consent, which is totally wrong. You want to have fun, right, we can do it, but don’t you think it will be better to do it as I’m willing?”<br />
<br />
All the other boy agrees and Moth is the first to apologize, followed by John, Mike, and finally Chris.<br />
<br />
“What about we meet up with other normal sizes gays and shrunken men poolside, if it’s okay with you Wyatt”, said Chris.<br />
<br />
“Sounds fine with me, will you carry me Chris?” Said with a little shy tone<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, Wyatt has some kind of attraction for Chris, so in his mind, it’s the best occasion for being touched by him. Inside himself, he giggled thinking that a homophobic man could hold him in his fist, touching him. So without thinking further, Chris picked up the tiny man who loved the sensation of the warm and soft skin on his tiny body. It was like receiving a very long and comforting hug.<br />
<br />
All the boys went outside to walk toward the almost Olympic size swimming pool. They also saw a very interesting bar where they also serves snacks and non alcohol drinks. The counter has a built in swimming pool, a tinier counter, tables and stool benches for shrunken guys. The entire place was huge and able to accommodate hundreds of persons what ever their sizes. <br />
<br />
The group began to seat at the bar, and Chris put tiny Wyatt at a tiny table in front of them. A shrunken blond athletic middle 30’ years old waiter only wearing a Speedo swimsuit walked toward Wyatt to take his order and a few seconds later, a normal size one took the gang’s one. They all ordered the special tropical punch which contains proteins and carbohydrates. In the waiting, they observed a few guys seated there too. In the tiny swimming pool, there were two very young brown-skinned teen boys swimming, like doing a race or something. A middle 40’s years old man, obviously Italian, was looking at them holding a stopwatch. Moth could not help it to watch them and called a bet with the other guys to know who will win. Would it be the one with the blue swimsuit or the one with the yellow one? Well, Moth sure has a gaming problem lol. <br />
<br />
“We’ve got a winner!” Declared the Italian man.<br />
<br />
Too bad, Moth has bet on the one with the blue swimsuit, but it’s the yellow one who won. But what he saw next disturbed him a lot. All the guys were looking at the man who fished the boys out of the tiny swimming pool to then dry them with tiny towels like they were not able to do it them-self. The one with the blue swimsuit got extra attention from the man. The one who lose got lucked inside some kind of cage while the winner received lots of caress from that middle age pervert. <br />
<br />
“Hey guys, anyone wants to buy that tiny looser in the cage? It’s the fourth time in a row he loses, I bet some kind may find a new use for him?”, said that not so caring man.<br />
<br />
Wyatt stood up, forgetting how tiny he was, and yelled at the disgusting man: “Hey you jerk, leave that kid alone and free that one in the cage, or else!!!” <br />
<br />
The Italian man tried to grab him, but Chris protected him. He was very impressed by his tiny friend courage. The tiny brown skinned teen has been dropped in the swimming pool, but he has not being harm. The man was huge and got very angry, so Chris, John, Mike and Moth teamed up to restrain him and the waiter called the security.  Even on Pleasure Island, there are rules of no violence. It ended up that the two tiny guys did not came with the Italian man at all, he drugged them to take advantage of them.  The tiny swimmers has their sized restored, but for compensation, the Italian man has been shrunk down to a doll size and given to the boys who left the place not long after.<br />
<br />
After all those emotions, the gang picked up Wyatt to meet some other guys at the regular swimming pool. It was quite crowded, but they were able to reserve a nice spot. Almost everyone normal size has tiny guys with them. Next to there location, were some college boys who are in a wrestlers group, maybe in the same fraternity. So they talked about their respective sports,   Chris, John, Mike and Moth talked about football, the other young men about wrestling. Wyatt was fascinated to see all those so fit guys. As he imagined how cool it would be to see a tiny wrestler fighting against a giant hand, he saw one. Yip, that group also has their tiny guy to play with. So they gave a little demonstration. The tiny wrestler played the game of {You want catch me!}. So one of the guy chased after him and pinned him down under his hug hand. But the tiny guy was fighting in a very tough way, he was definitively not weak.  That view gave Wyatt a good erection.<br />
<br />
At their other side were three young teen boys sunbathing. They looked to be Latinos, but they were wearing way too tight swimsuits revealing way too much. A funny fact, they all worn exactly the same brand black man’s sungas (Square cut swimsuit in use in Brazil who think Speedo’ are inappropriate).  Wyatt watched three very muscled and slightly hairy men at his size walking toward the giant teens. </p>
