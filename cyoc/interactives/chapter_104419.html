<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was thinking of how things had become so horrible. He tried to sit on a bed but at the moment his butt made its first contact with the mattress he realized he was wearing a diaper full of piss and poop.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t recommend to do that until the Caretakers arrive.&quot; Jack said. &quot;They collect the used diapers, clean our buttocks and give us new and clean diapers.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are they the ones with the radioactive suits?&quot; Mark said and Jack nodded. &quot;They&#39;re like babysitters and treat you like a baby!&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what they do with the used diapers, but if I don&#39;t give them I&#39;ll be walking with my poop all day. I&#39;m sure you know that our basic functions are disabled. We are not too different from babies.&quot; Jack said.<br />
After Jack ended speaking two Caretakers entered the room. Each one went to one of the boys and with some hand gestures they ordered them to turn back and to lay on the bed. Mark wasn&#39;t sure to do it, but when he saw Jack doing it with no resistance he knew that he didn&#39;t have another choice. The Caretakers made their jobs quickly and in a few minutes they were leaving the room with a couple of dirty diapers on their hands. Mark and Jack were wearing new fresh diapers now.<br />
&quot;You see?&quot; Jack said. &quot;Now, we have a few hours before our next testing.&quot;<br />
&quot;There will be more?&quot; Mark said.<br />
&quot;Of course. This area has a schedule of 3 testing per day.&quot; Jack said. &quot;I&#39;d taken the first one alone. This was the second one and we&#39;ll have the last one at 8:00 pm.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do they do same testing on each session?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
&quot;Not exactly.&quot; Jack said. &quot;This one is a regular on all days I&#39;ve been here. The one they do in mornings is the quickest, just a few syringes to take samples, sometimes they do it when we&#39;re still sleeping. But, the one in the night... is the most... significant...&quot;<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Mark asked, he was a little scared of how Jack said his last words and that it was the testing which was coming.<br />
&quot;Well, among us is called the Change.&quot; Jack said. &quot;Usually, it implies big modifications on your body or behavior. For example, the first night I was here they make lose my bladder control, then my rear, my hability to change my diapers by myself. I think you get it.&quot; Mark mouth opened scared.<br />
&quot;How long have you been here?&quot; Mark asked Jack.<br />
&quot;A week.&quot; Jack said. &quot;But I&#39;ve met some others that have been here for more than that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Others?&quot; Mark said. &quot;Do you have contact with other guys?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course. This is not a prison.&quot; Jack said. &quot;While we are in the facilities we can go anywhere except for the restricted areas.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, can I go to look for my friends?&quot; Mark said.<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Jack nodded. &quot;I can give you a tour if you want.&quot;<br />
Mark said yes and they left their room and began to walk through the corridor.<br />
&quot;The facilities have a spider-like shape.&quot; Jack said as they walked. &quot;Imagine that we are at the end of one spider&#39;s leg. This corridor connect us with the central area where all the legs or other areas converge. It&#39;s a long walk but I think we can arrive there and return to our place before the testing begins.&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s in the central area?&quot; Mark asked him.<br />
&quot;The headquarters, a dining hall and, most important, the restricted areas.&quot; Jack said. &quot;Oh well, there are restricted areas all over, but there are more in there.&quot;<br />
&quot;And about the other areas...&quot; Mark said. &quot;How many are? What they do there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, we called them by zones.&quot; Jack said. &quot;There are 8 zones besides of the central area. We both are in the Body Zone where they test male human body functions and developments. Next to us is the Mind Zone where they play with the guys brains in order to alter their behaviors, attitudes and abilities. The guys on there are difficult to treat, seriously.&quot;<br />
Mark thought if any of his friends was put there. The idea of scientists playing with his mind made Mark a little worried.<br />
&quot;On the other side is the Maternity Zone. On there they kept the younger ones, the real babies and toddlers. I&#39;m not sure what kind of testings they made on them but I think they do that since their conceptions. Next to that area is the Ferlitity Zone, where they modify the test subjects bodies in order to increase their semen production. Be happy that we don&#39;t have those testings on our schedule or you&#39;ll be wearing something worse than your diaper.&quot;<br />
Mark remembered how Raul was producing too much semen and precum at his home. Maybe they have left him there, he thought.<br />
&quot;Next to Mind Zone is the Cyborg Zone. That place freaks me out. On there, the guys are mutilated during testings and get bionic parts which replace their lost. I&#39;ve seen a few guys who are more robot than human. It&#39;s creepy.&quot;<br />
Mark was wishing none of his friends had sent there. It sounded like a nightmare.<br />
&quot;The next one is the Gender Zone. It&#39;s the only area where they have girls instead of boys. They are tested with male enhancement products which made them less and less girly with each testing. At first, the most feminine girls enter there, but after some time they turn into full boys and are sent to another areas. &quot;<br />
&quot;Near to Fertility is the Animal Zone. On there, boys get animals serums which made them to develop animal body parts or characteristics. I guess that affects their minds too, because they&#39;re very aggressive.&quot;<br />
&quot;And the last one?&quot; Mark asked after repass what Jack had said to him. Body, Mind, Maternity, Fertility, Cyborg, Gender and Animal, there was just one left.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know about it...&quot; Jack said. &quot;That&#39;s the only area which is completely restricted. But I&#39;ve heard from my father that&#39;s where they kept the boys with the most severe conditions and where they made the most terrible testings. Even worse than in Cyborg Zone.&quot;<br />
Mark was completely freaked. He was wishing none of his friends had been sent there. He was almost sure Raul was on the Fertility Zone, but where were Kevin and Jimmy sent? He was terrified of the idea of any of them could be there. But, then he remembered that Kevin had swallowed two pills before they arrive here. What did that make to him? Mark needs to know.<br />
&quot;Ok, we&#39;ve arrived.&quot; Jack said and Mark saw a metal door in front of them. &quot;This door lead us to the dining hall. Luckily, we can find some other boys from the other Zones.&quot;<br />
After that, he crossed the door followed by Mark.</p>
