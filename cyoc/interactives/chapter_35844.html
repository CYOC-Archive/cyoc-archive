<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking down at Daniel, Jennifer felt herself become immediately aroused.  The living <br />
room air of Daniel's father's townhouse was heavy with the thick musky odor of male <br />
canine being emitted by her friend.  <br />
<br />
&quot;He probably doesn't even realize how far he's gone,&quot; she thought a little glibly to herself, <br />
surveying Daniel's changed body.  Jennifer noticed Daniel's ears were now fully flopped <br />
down into doggy triangles, and generously covered in an ebony black fur.  His nose had <br />
pushed slightly up and forward into the hint of a muzzle, his lips off-color as they made <br />
their transition to charcoal black.  <br />
<br />
Just the sight of seeing Daniel with his proto-muzzle made her moist, which only <br />
increased with her view of the thin, handsome tail he'd sprouted.  But strangely, Daniel <br />
had kicked off his new tennis shoes revealing the transformation to his body that Jennifer <br />
found the most animalistic and highly sexual -five brown claws on each foot, poking their <br />
way from the tips of his toes and out of his distressed socks.<br />
<br />
While it took Jennifer only moments to survey Daniel's transformation, it felt like an <br />
eternity to Daniel.  He was turning bright red at having been caught masturbating by <br />
Jennifer -one of the cutest girls at school (even if they were friends)- and didn't have a <br />
clue what to say.  Only when Jennifer approached him from the doorway did he realize that <br />
she was no longer wearing any clothes, the golden fur on her chest parting to reveal four <br />
sets of breasts of decreasing size.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You know Daniel, you look rather cute like that, hand down your pants and that <br />
expression on your face looking like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar,&quot; said <br />
Jennifer, her voice husky with desire.  Daniel watched as she sauntered over to the couch, <br />
taking a moment to toss her still human-like hair.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You-you-you know you're naked, right?&quot; stuttered Daniel, still wanting to sink between <br />
the couch cushions in embarrassment, his canine feelings of lust quelled for a brief <br />
moment.  &quot;Of course I do, silly,&quot; replied Jennifer, reaching out a paw and taking hold of <br />
Daniel's t-shirt.  &quot;Now let's take a look at your fur again so we can tell what breed you <br />
are,&quot; cajoled Jennifer, helping the startled Dan to remove his shirt.<br />
<br />
With Daniel's shirt off, the white fur with occasional black spots that covered his chest <br />
said it all.  &quot;Oh my gosh, I should call you Pongo&quot; teased Jennifer, as her hand rubbed <br />
circles in Daniel's chest fur.  &quot;Why's that?&quot; responded Daniel stupidly.  &quot;Cause silly, you're <br />
gonna be a Dalmatian!!!&quot; squealed Jennifer, throwing her furry arms around Daniel.  <br />
<br />
Jennifer's announcement of his breed caused Daniel's penis to become instantly erect and <br />
his tail to start wagging, neither of which escaped Jennifer's notice.  &quot;And let's take a look <br />
at little 'Pongo,' I mean 'Daniel,'&quot; teased Jennifer lithely slipping from the couch to the <br />
ground as she tugged Daniel's bluejeans down around his ankles.  Daniel could only stare <br />
in disbelief, as she revealed his dark blue tented boxer briefs.<br />
<br />
Like a tidal wave, the pheromones being emitted by Daniel flooded Jennifer's nose.  <br />
Shaking with desire, she reached out a paw and peeled back his underwear to reveal eight <br />
inches of prime doghood.  Daniel, looking down, could see his radically altered maleness, <br />
but rather than feeling fear or hesitation, he felt a strange sense of pride.  &quot;This is me, this <br />
is what defines me as a dog,&quot; he thought quietly.  Less philosophical than Daniel, Jennifer <br />
was merely captured by its beauty, eight inches of moist pink canine cock nestled in a <br />
forest of milky white pubic fur.  This was what she wanted; what she truly desired above <br />
all else.  <br />
<br />
On her hands and knees in front of the seated Daniel and with instinct taking over, <br />
Jennifer's tongue shot out of her muzzle, slurping the full length of Daniel's exposed <br />
member.  &quot;YES!, OH FUCK YES!, YES!, WHYESS!, WHOOYESS! WOOF! WOOF!&quot; barked Daniel, <br />
his growing finger claws tearing gouges in the upholstery of the couch.  To Jennifer, <br />
Daniel's frantic barks were nothing short of an aphrodisiac, as she was finding Daniel's <br />
growing canine behavior to be an incredible turn-on.  <br />
<br />
The most stupendous turn-on for Jennifer, however, came in speeding along Daniel's <br />
transformation to full doghood.  With her attentions, Daniel's muzzle had fully grown out <br />
into the narrow but proud muzzle of a Dalmatian, and white and black-spotted fur had <br />
spread to cover his chest and forearms.  By this time, Daniel was simply in a universe of <br />
pleasure all his own, head thrown on top of the back of the couch, eyes glazed over, and <br />
long canine tongue lolling out of his open muzzle.<br />
<br />
Glad to give pleasure to her good friend, the real prize for Jennifer was Daniel's still-<br />
mutating manhood.  When she had first changed into her humanoid golden retriever form, <br />
Jennifer had secretly viewed numerous websites on the internet showing canine anatomy <br />
and breeding behavior.  She justified this by telling herself that she was just trying to learn <br />
about her new body.  Of course, Jennifer had also viewed some more disturbing videos <br />
showing various lewd acts between dogs and people.  Disgusted with herself, Jennifer <br />
soon after shut the computer off but not before she felt the burning shame of arousal <br />
around her furry cunt.  <br />
<br />
This time, however, camped in front of Daniel's beautiful spear, Jennifer only felt the <br />
desire to give Daniel what she knew he would want as a male dog.  Seeing some of the <br />
thickly furred skin that was already working its way up his shaft, Jennifer reached out a <br />
paw and began to stretch it further up Daniel's pink doghood, causing Daniel to emit soft <br />
whines.  &quot;Jennifer, what-what-what's happening?&quot; sputtered Daniel, having noticed that <br />
the sharp pleasure of her wet tongue on his bare cock had been replaced by the dull ache <br />
of soft pressure on his genitals.  &quot;Don't worry Daniel, I'm just helping you grow your <br />
sheath,&quot; replied Jennifer, almost orgasming at the word itself and the thought of her once <br />
human friend with the mating equipment of a dog.<br />
<br />
Jennifer realized that her instincts were telling her that she was almost ready to be mated <br />
by Daniel.  His body's transformation was almost complete, although Jennifer was glad to <br />
see she still recognized Daniel's bony cheeks and lovely green eyes in spite of his <br />
handsome canine muzzle and furry complexion.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer, you smell so goooood,&quot; moaned Daniel, leaning down and thrusting his nose at <br />
the golden puff of fur between her breasts.  Enjoying her teasing of Daniel but not able to <br />
hold out much longer, she playfully pushed him back onto the couch.  Daniel growled in <br />
frustration.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't growl at me like a puppy, Daniel!&quot; chided Jennifer petulantly.  &quot;Besides, don't you <br />
want to see your doghood?&quot;  she asked, her hands creeping over to the thick tube of <br />
furred skin on his crotch.  Spotted tail wagging in anticipation, Daniel most certainly did.  <br />
All it took was for Jennifer's fingers to pull slightly at the opening of Daniel's white furred <br />
sheath, and his slick pink shaft jutted out into the air while the thickly furred skin of his <br />
sheath crumpled and collected at the base of his cock.  &quot;That's a good boy, a good boy!&quot; <br />
encouraged Jennifer as Daniel began to pant and thrust into her hand.  Part of her <br />
wondered why she was talking to Daniel like this, but she dismissed these questions from <br />
her sex-addled mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Daniel, this part of your penis is very special&quot; continued Jennifer, drawing on her <br />
store of internet knowledge and gently pulling at the ring of fur at the base of his cock.  <br />
For a moment, Daniel let loose a yip of pain but then felt a movement in his cock.  Looking <br />
down, he could see that his pink shaft had passed out of its fuzzy sheath by at least <br />
another inch-and-a-half, exposing a distinct swelling at the base.  &quot;What's that?&quot; asked <br />
Daniel, reaching down and grabbing hold of it.  The rough treatment of this most sensitive <br />
of areas caused Daniel to howl in pain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't do that, silly!  It's your knot, and it's very sensitive&quot; scolded Jennifer, giggling.  <br />
Carefully, Daniel again brought his fingers to his knot and took hold, fireworks of pleasure <br />
exploding in his brain as the rough pawpads on his fingers made contact with the nerve <br />
endings until he could take it no longer and removed his hand for a rest.  Watching this <br />
display of Daniel the Dalmation with his full doghood and knot now exposed, Jennifer <br />
felt a feral lust build inside of her and suddenly realized she was ready to be mated.<br />
<br />
Savoring the crisp air of the living room on the entirety his maleness, it took Daniel several <br />
moments to realize that Jennifer was no longer at his feet.  Instead, he looked up and saw <br />
she was halfway across the room on all fours, her golden furred ass pointed in his <br />
direction.  Her tail was still and curled back, and instinctively, he realized that she was <br />
submitting herself to him.  Practically, he realized this was the case when Jennifer turned <br />
her head and intoned, &quot;why don't you come over here Pongo and show me what kind of <br />
sire you are?&quot;  <br />
<br />
With that, Daniel let loose a **WOOF** of joy, practically leaping off the couch and stalking <br />
toward Jennifer.</p>
