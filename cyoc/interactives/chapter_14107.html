<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;ALL RIGHT YOU MAGGOTS! Get your sorry asses out of that bus and form a line,&quot; the Warden bellowed. A dozen boys barely seventeen years old exited the bus and stood in a rough row in front of the Warden Jones. The prison yard was devoid of anything green I existed in shades of concrete, asphalt, and rusting metal. The Warden stared at the clipboard through half-frame reading glasses. He was a big man with a mean look and a short haircut. His reputation as a rotten bastard permeated the entire juvenile system. This work farm was the last resort for those reprobates in the juvenile system. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHO, I said WHO… has been fooling around with my list? What smart-ass thought it was funny to put Howard C. Heinie-Gruber on my list?&quot; Warden Jones bellowed. Everyone, prisoners, guards, assistants, psychologists, dogs, and crickets stood silent for a moment. Then one of the boys, a handsome lad with creamy white skin, curly coal-black hair, and a dynamite body stepped forward and raised his hand.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It's no joke, Sir. That's my name - Howard Charles Heinie-Gruber. I go by Charlie,&quot; Charlie said. His hand shook as the Warden scrutinized him. Ever since he turned ten, Charlie got away with being just the right side of bad using his looks. He was well known to Children and Youth Services and the six foster families who tried to adopt him. Between the booze, drugs, tattoos, piercing, gambling, petty theft, shakedown scams, fireworks, stink bombs, and a host of other barely legal antics, Charlie always used his looks and charm to talk his way out of trouble. HE only stood about five foot two and he couldn't afford to fight guys a foot taller and much heavier. This last time, however, his buddy sold him down the drain so to speak - or really, more like up the river. <br />
<br />
&quot;Howie Heinie? Your father named you Howie Heinie? What the hell sort of a name is Heinie-Gruber anyhow?&quot;  Charlie heard the first words and then tuned the world out. Warden Jones went on for five full minutes making embarrassing and sarcastic remarks about Charlie's name. Long ago Charlie learned to shut down and ignore this drivel. HE didn't realize Warden Jones was done and Warden Jones slapped him so hard he knocked Charlie to the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;I asked you what animal you wanted to tend but since you're dreaming and not listening, I'm going to pick it for you,&quot; Warden Jones bellowed even louder than before. <br />
<br />
&quot;And let that be a lesson to the rest of you. Any insubordination will be met with a beating. You are mine now. You belong to ME! And don't you forget it.&quot; He let Charlie lay on the ground until he assigned the rest of the boys. Then he ordered his men to put Charlie in the Land Rover. They drove for two hours across country to the high plain. A herd of goats wandered toward the Rover as it came to a stop near a small grove with a lean-to and stacks of firewood. A stream meandered nearby.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This is your assignment - you WILL, I said WILL take care of these goats. When we return in four months, they all will be here and all of them will be in good shape. If not then I will personally send you to an adult prison where you can be butt boy for a whole host of hairy, muscle-bound, and very horny convicts. Do you understand! Boy?&quot;  Warden Jones screamed so loud he scared the birds out of the trees. He pointed to a crate in the back of the car. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is fifteen days of MRE's, kid. We'll restock you before you run out. There's a manual on the care of goats in there too…,&quot; the Warden said and kicked Charlie and the crate out of the Land Rover and then drove away. <br />
(MRE - meals ready to eat - military rations)<br />
<br />
Charlie watched the Land Rover disappear over the hills. When it finally vanished, Charlie climbed the tallest tree and surveyed the plain. It was way too large, way too far away from anything to even think about escape. He settled down into the lean-to and took stock of what he had. It wasn't much - shoes without laces, no socks, pants without a belt, a T-shirt, a hoodie, one book on goats and two weeks of meals. One of the baby goats - a kid - butted his leg playfully. Charlie petted the little beast and shooed it back to its mother. It didn't listen. Instead, it butted Charlie again. Amused at the silly kid, he got down on all fours and played head butt with the kid back. <br />
<br />
That wasn't the best idea in the world. The kid really smacked Charlie's head and left it ringing. Charlie laughed and sat back on his haunches and caught the kid as it charged again. It rolled right over him and ran back to the herd. Charlie took stock of the herd, counting the she goats, the rams, the kids and then he read his book.  The day was hot and breezy. He lay in the sun and relaxed. He stripped off his hoodie, T-shirt, and pants so he could tan. <br />
<br />
Charlie's nearly hairless body was creamy white and well muscled. The past year in high school, he tried out for gymnastics and had really built up his body. As the sun sank low in the sky, he rounded up the goats. The strays gave him the first real exercise he had in days. By sunset, the goats stood contented under the trees. The same kid can over to him and other kids followed. He butted Charlie again. This time Charlie kept his head up and hit the little beast as if he would hit a soccer ball. The little goat bounced off. They did it again and the little goat pawed at Charlie. Charlie hugged the little goat and let it lick his face. <br />
<br />
Charlie held onto the goat. It kept him from crying. Both goat and boy fell asleep against each other. <br />
<br />
Four sunny days passed with Charlie minding the goats, laying about and playing with the kids. The night of the fourth day a thunderstorm blew up and Charlie had a tough time keeping the goats near the fire. He had to chase a few goats across the fields. His shoes turned out to be useless and as he slid around in the mud, his pants and hoodie gained a crust of muck and weeds. It took him most of the next day to round up all the goats. That evening he ate two of the MRE's and a bunch of fruits and berries he found nearby as his reward. <br />
<br />
Over the next few days, Charlie moved his goats to a new meadow with better protection against storms. This meadow had wheat and alfalfa growing. Around the edges, there was an abundance of sunflowers. The book said that sunflower seed were good for goats so Charlie figured a way for the goats to eat them. Charlie ate them too. Out of shear boredom, he tried eating the wheat, the alfalfa, and some of the grasses. At first that didn't work too well. In desperation, Charlie milked a few of the female goats. Without a cup, he had to suckle the tits on their udders. That was strange and not something that a real man did. Charlie vowed never to do it again. However, hunger made him forget that vow.  <br />
<br />
Somewhere in the universe, the god of goats took notice of Charlie and his predicament. Two more days without food made Charlie desperate and he tried to eat the wheat, the alfalfa, and some of the grasses again. This time, although it took patience, his body adapted to the food. Charlie rested easy for the first time in a week, his hunger satisfied and between the goat milk and the grains, he knew wouldn't die out here on the high plain. The weather stayed warm and sunny.<br />
<br />
Charlie and the goats thrived on the high plain. <br />
<br />
One morning, he knelt down on all fours to drink at the stream and the kids joined him. He stayed on all fours and played with them most of the morning. He decided to see if he could stay of his cut and blistered feet. His arms and legs hurt from the odd position but over a few days, maybe a week, his body got used to crawling around. The goats like him batter at their level and respond to his commands as if he was their leader. <br />
<br />
One particularly warm night, he slept with the kids, the young and immature goats. They liked to lick the salt off his body. They ate what was left of his boxers while he was asleep. From then on Charlie wandered the high plain naked. <br />
<br />
Charlie returned every two or three days to see if the Warden left any more food at the lean-to. A re-supply never came. Charlie actively sought out better sources of food and found fruit, root vegetables, and greens. Mostly Charlie had to make due with grasses, wheat, wild corn, and anything else that grew. The goats found more food than he did and they shared it. Charlie didn't try to sleep around a fire anymore. He slept with the goats. Their hot little bodies made great pillows. <br />
<br />
The summer months passed and fall came. Charlie's funny four legged wanderings got easier to him or so it seemed. His fingers and toes grew hard and stiff. His hips felt like they adjust to his new gate. Charlie didn’t worry too much about the changes he felt, he just continued to live with the goats. They found a pumpkin patch, a corn patch, and an apple orchard. He wished he had cooking utensils so he could cook, but that was something they neglected to give him. Winter in this habitat was warm, so once Charlie found a cave to spend the winter in, he didn't worry about clothing. He was a clean as the goats and since he was alone, he didn't care much about his appearance. That was a relief for him. The goats didn't care about much of the drugs, booze and sex that got him into trouble. Their affection was based on how he treated them. <br />
<br />
The first births occurred that fall. For the first time in his life, Charlie had babies to care for and keep healthy. Charlie greeted each new birth as his own child. The book described many thing he learned to do for the babies. They wanted the affection and so did Charlie. Charlie devoted his efforts to keep the kids alive and keep them well. The original kids grew older and now younger ones replaced them. The butting game got easier with the little kids. Charlie's body also started changing. He didn't notice it but his feet and ankles adjusted to his four-legged walk. His four fingers stiffened into two large fingers with the thumb behind them. The nails on both his hands and feet thickened and hardened to support his weight. Charle's stomach thinned out to let him bend forward and matching that, his spinal column shifted and thickened to let him walk on four limbs. Luckily, Charlie's previous year of gymnastics left his arms, shoulders and chest strong enough to support his new stance. Charlie noticed that a thick coat of fine, curly black hair grew on his legs and hips. He liked being hairless, but since winter was coming he decided that he could use some hair on his legs. Once, when he was drinking water form the stream, he noticed that he had grown a goatee and that the mass of curly black hair on his head grew down onto his back and shoulders. <br />
<br />
The winter was harsh on the entire herd. Winter on the planet didn’t have snow or ice, but the temperatures stayed under 60 and above 40 degrees F. The plants died off too. Charlie had to forage far and wide to get food for the herd. He tried to stay warm near a fire in the caves but that wasn't possible. Any cold night out on the plain, naked and exposed, made him wish for clothing or fur. He gathered the goats around his body to stay warm. <br />
<br />
Winter finally changed to spring and as the weather became sunny and warm, the plants grew and the herd thrived again. Charlie counted the goats. He lost none to the winter. Only four members died of old age and a dozen new kids joined the herd. If the warden came back now, Charlie could claim a triumph. That day, Charlie romped with the goats chasing them out through the fields and prancing over the new grasses. They ranged over familiar fields finding new growth to eat and fine places to play. Charlie helped the baby kids born in the winter over the bigger obstacle, showed them how to handle the new grasses and flowers, and for fun in the late afternoon, he taught them to head butt. They all played head butt that day. Tired from all the excitement, Charlie and his goats spent on the plain in a field of new and very soft grass. <br />
<br />
The next morning as Charlie watched all the by the stream, he took a good look at his reflection in the water. He had two small bumps on his forehead and pointy ears hiding under his mass of curly black hair. He excused the bumps as just bruises brought on by the celebration of head butting. As the weeks went on, Charlie noticed that the bumps got bigger. He had horns. Last summer might have depressed him, but this summer he liked horns because they would protect him from being hurt in the head butting contests. <br />
<br />
One of the younger goats had a new game. He kept trying to mount Charlie from behind. Each time Charlie would chase him away but once or twice, the young goat nearly nailed him. Charlie wished he had a tail like the other goats. A tail would protect his butt from unwanted attention. He also noticed that several of the female goats would flag him when they went into heat. Charlie never played around with animals before and this confused him. He knew the mating games that the goats played from watching them. He just ignored these advances for well into the summer. It's not that he was shy around the she-goats, he still suckled milk from them nearly daily, but his human side worried about sex with goats and his last taboo of bestiality. <br />
<br />
The days of summer grew hot and languid. Charlie and the goats lounged near a nice sized pond. Charlie's body changed so slowly that he never noticed the extent of the transformation. His rear legs and feet were completely goat-like. He had a solid rump with thick, muscular thighs and short calves. His feet lengthened and his toes formed hooves. From his hips down to his hooves, curly black hair covered his legs. His crotch remained human with his thick, uncut cock and large, low hanging balls getting knocked around if he wasn't careful. Although he could stand upright, the changes in his hips and spine made travel on four feet easier and faster. His abs and chest remained hairless and muscular. So did his deltoids, triceps and biceps. For the first time in his life, Charlie had massive lats and he loved his muscles. He often flexed to see his reflection in any body of water. He felt good when he did. The sun tanned his skin a rich olive-brown color that complimented the mane of black hair on his head and shoulders. His ears now stood at the top of his head and poked out from under his curly hair. His horns thrust out from his forehead a good six inches. Charlie never noticed that the middle of his face grew out into a muzzle and his bearded chin grew into a point. He discovered a natural soap in one of the crushed plants and used it on his body. It left his hair curly and shiny. <br />
<br />
One fine midsummer day, Charlie was alone with one of the younger she-goats. This was her first time. Charlie remembered her birth and the hard times she had. He knelt behind her, stroked his cock erect, and rubbed it in her lubricating fluids. Feeling how hot she was, he just couldn't resist and plunged into her. It only took a few minutes for him to reach orgasm with the little goat squeezing and pumping at his cock. After he spent himself deep inside her, she bounded away happy. Charlie fell on all fours spent and shaking. This was his first orgasm since the Warden abandoned him in this prison. The emotion overwhelmed him. He stood there on all fours sobbing at the realization. But he didn’t sob long. His little nemesis in the goat world, the little kid who kept trying to hump his butt, jumped on his back and hit the target on the first try. Startled, Charlie crawled forward about ten feet but the young kid stayed on and kept humping. Charlie tried to shake the kid off his back, but he couldn't. Reluctant to hurt the young goat, he just let him continue. As a boy, Charlie's foster uncles and brothers used to fuck him. This wasn't like that. This actually felt good. He let the little goat finish and pull out. Charlie found a stream to wash off and groom the hair all over his body.  The rest of the summer Charlie continued to satisfy his sexual desires on the she-goats and he let some of the young male goats use him, too.  <br />
<br />
Again, summer turned into autumn. The seasons changes in their regular order. Earth abides all the troubles oa man. Charlie discovered a six inches tail growing out the base of his spine. He wished he had a mirror to see it. More important than any tail, he worked hard to get hay, alfalfa, and sunflower nuts packed away in the cave for the coming winter. He disassembled the lean-to and used the pieces to build a roof over the entrance of the cave. During the work he noticed that his scrotum grew thick and furry while his balls grew larger and pulled up against his stomach. The fur continued to grow up and over his cock in a protective sheath. Charlie liked these changes. They kept his unit safe from thorns and the occasional hit. He liked the way his horns thickened to a good two inches on the top of his forehead and they curved around sides of his face like a Ram's horn. During head butt play, the kids didn't hurt him when they hit as hard as they could. In fact, Charlie squared off against the largest buck goat and win the head butt. The horns cushioned the blows to his skull.<br />
