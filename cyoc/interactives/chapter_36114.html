<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny had just climbed down from her chair when the phone rang. &quot;Jenny, it's your friend Hanna&quot; her mom called from the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom, I'll be right there&quot; Jenny said after she came down from a name induced orgasm.<br />
<br />
In the hall Jenn's mom handed her the phone and said &quot;If she wants to come of and stay the night she can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny was a little bit perplexed by this but took the phone and said &quot;Hi Hanna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Could I come over for the night and maybe the rest of the weekend? There's something that I want to talk about. I think that you'll find it relevant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you when I get there&quot; Hanna said. &quot;If I'm right in what I'm thinking then I want to tell you face to face.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has to do with what happened at school today&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so I came to school dressed&quot; Jenny said. &quot;It was a dare ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not exactly that&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what about it?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Hanna said in a conspiratorial whisper. Then in her normal voice asked &quot;So can I come over and stay the night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh my mom said that it was ok&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I'll see you in a few&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Jenny said and hung up. She wondered what Hanna knew. It would take Hanna about ten minutes to arrive. She figured that she could search the Internet to find out more about the curse. Maybe she could find a way to reverse it. She went to the living room and asked &quot;Emily, could I use your computer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you give me some milk Slut&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
Sighing Jenny went over to Emily and offered her her breast which she took.<br />
<br />
Emily sucked for a minute and when she was finished said &quot;Don't get any of your juice on the keyboard. It took me forever to get the keys unstuck the last time you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't&quot; Jenny said as she turned to go up to Emily's room. She was a little disappointed that Emily hadn't continued sucking on her breast longer. It had felt good. She started wondering why women didn't breast feed their babies. She knew that there were a few that did but the majority bottle fed. Oh well, it wasn't something that she needed to concern herself with at this time.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later she hadn't had much luck finding out more about the curse. She had found some sites that laid out what she already knew about the curse. She did come across a site that was interesting. It had said that a local geek had come to his school ranting that he was changed from the star quarterback to a geek. He had also said that he couldn't get revenge on the cheerleader who cursed him. She knew how he felt. She couldn't get back at Kyle Perkins since he had made sure that she couldn't pass the curse on to anyone.<br />
<br />
Emily came in and said &quot;Hanna's here Slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Emily&quot; Jenny said as she shut down the computer.<br />
<br />
When she went downstairs she found that Hanna was just coming in the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Hanna dear&quot; her mom said. &quot;You must be uncomfortable in those clothes. Why don't you go ahead and take them off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Mrs. Smith&quot; Hanna said as she started to strip.<br />
<br />
Jenny was wondering why Hanna was stripping then she remembered that she couldn't stand wearing clothes. She did only to conform to societal standards. When she was in her own house or was given permission in someone else's house she went without clothes. It wasn't only that she was very uncomfortable in clothes but that her immune system actually began to fail the longer she wore clothes. She had to eat lunch in the girls locker room so her immune system didn't get too bad. Jenny could understand being forced to go<br />
naked but at least Hanna could wear clothes for a little while.<br />
<br />
When Hanna had finished stripping she said &quot;Let's go to your room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
Hanna stuffed her clothes into a pink sports bag and followed Jenny up to her room.<br />
<br />
Once Jenny had closed the door she asked &quot;What did you want to talk to me about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to talk to you about the curse&quot; Hanna said. &quot;I know you've been cursed and I know who did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have been&quot; Jenny said. &quot;How did you know though?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hanna reached into her bag and handed Jenny a note. &quot;I found that&quot; she said. &quot;You must have dropped it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny realized that it was the note that Kyle had stuck in her locker. She could have sworn that she had put it in her bag. It must have fallen out when she took a book out.<br />
<br />
&quot;He really did a number on you didn't he&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He did&quot; Jenny said. &quot;I'm stuck like this since I can't pass the curse on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry about this&quot; Hanna said. &quot;It's my fault. I'm the one who cursed Kyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not your fault that Kyle did this to me&quot; Jenny said. &quot;He picked me because we pants him last week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's another reason he picked you&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Did you hear about the geek who had turned up at school claiming to be the star quarterback?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was reading that before you came&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that geek is Kyle Perkins&quot; Hanna said. &quot;And he was the star quarterback before I cursed him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't explain why he picked me other than for revenge&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was probably revenge but not for the pants&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was it then?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps you should hear how I was cursed first&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Perhaps it will give you a better understanding of what led<br />
to Kyle cursing you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It began two years ago&quot; Hanna began. &quot;I was a 34 year old man and I had just moved here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a 34 year old man?&quot; Jenny interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just said that and yes, I was&quot; Hanna said a bit annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we've been friends since first grade&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that the curse can also transform reality&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Any way I had just moved to this town. The first phone call I received was from some kid and all he asked was transform or dare. Now you have to realize that I had never heard of the town curse before so I thought that it was a prank call and hung up. A minute later my phone rang again and it was the same kid telling me that I got both the dare and transformation. He said that for my transformation that I'd be transformed into a sixteen year old girl. One who not only found clothes uncomfortable but whose immune system<br />
would deteriorate the longer clothes were worn. He did say that my immune system would return to normal once I was completely naked. He also left me my dick though it would be hidden inside me and I would have to concentrate to bring it out of it's special place. He also said that everyone would remember me like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least you got to keep your dick&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would rather have been made a complete female without the dick&quot; Hanna said. &quot;I learned how to bring it out fairly quickly but I don't bring it out very often.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny could remember Hanna showing her her dick on a couple of occasions. &quot;So what was your dare?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;For my dare he made it three parts&quot; Hanna said. &quot;The first part was that I'd be bi from then on. The second part was that I would join the cheer leading squad for a year. The third part was that I wouldn't be able to curse him back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you still cheer leading after the year?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found that I liked it so I stuck with it after the year&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why did you curse Kyle?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;After I had been cursed I did some research on it and was determined not to pass it on&quot; Hanna said. &quot;That changed just last week when Kyle had asked me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you curse him because of that?&quot; Jenny asked a bit puzzled by this.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't remember but he was your boyfriend&quot; Hanna said. &quot;I had told him no but he kept bugging me. I finally told him that I wouldn't date him since he was dating you and I wouldn't hurt you. He then said that it was alright, that you would never need to know. He made the mistake of telling me that he had other girlfriends besides you and one more wouldn't hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was going out with a jerk like that?&quot; Jenny asked taken aback.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you were though you didn't know that he had other girlfriends&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Anyway, in my anger I asked him transform or dare. He didn't choose fast enough so he got both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you transformed him into a geek&quot; Jenny said. &quot;What did you dare him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For his dare I dared him not to curse me back or to change me in any way through cursing someone else&quot; Hanna said. &quot;In my anger I didn't think to make sure that he couldn't pass the curse on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he couldn't get revenge on you&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He did get his revenge on me through you&quot; Hanna said. &quot;He transformed you into a slut and everyone thinks that this is the way that you have always been. It hurts me to see you this way. I'm so sorry. I can't even say your name now without you having an orgasm.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point Hanna broke down and cried. Jenny embraced her and said &quot;It's ok Hanna. I don't blame you for this. It was Kyle who had done this to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really don't blame me?&quot; Hanna asked through her sobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you first told me I did but not now&quot; Jenny said. &quot;As far as I remember we've been friends for a long time and I know you would never intentionally hurt me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you're a slut now and it's my fault&quot; Hanna said and started crying harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was Kyle who turned me into this, not you&quot; Jenny said. &quot;There is one positive about this. When I'm really aroused I can concentrate and learn way better than I did before. Sure I can't eat like you or use the bathroom like you. I also have to be naked and walk on the balls of my feet all the time but it isn't all that bad. I've enjoyed people milking me all day today. I just have to learn to live with my life now. You adjusted to your life and I'll adjust to<br />
mine. We'll get through this. Don't blame yourself for what a jerk Kyle is. From what you told me he was a jerk before you transformed him. I'm really glad that we pants him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I passed the curse on to him though&quot; Hanna sobbed. &quot;Then he passed the curse onto you to get revenge on me and you can't pass it on to anyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't you fault&quot; Jenny said. &quot;Listen Hanna, I want you to call me by my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you'll orgasm if I do&quot; Hanna sobbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't mind&quot; Jenny said. &quot;I want my best friend to call me by my name. I want my best friend to give me orgasms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really mean that?&quot; Hanna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do&quot; Jenny said. &quot;Why don't you show me your dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Hanna said drying her eyes and stepping back. A second later her dick had poked out of what had looked like a scar.<br />
<br />
Jenny was staring at it and started to wonder if she and Hanna could be more than best friends.</p>
