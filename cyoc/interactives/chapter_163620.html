<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul was determined to make the most of it as she walked out to the garage. He couldn’t help but notice how with her wobbly bum the dress swished around as she walked. The feeling of the silk dress rubbing against the slip she was wearing underneath was quite sensual.<br />
 <br />
‘Where are you going?’ The new Paul asked as the old Paul went to the passenger side of the car. ‘You are the one with the keys and driver’s licence at the moment. This is a chance for a driving lesson’<br />
<br />
Paul had been planning to sit the test for his learner driver’s permit during the upcoming holidays. So at the moment his mother was right. She/he was the only one of the two of them who could legally drive. ‘Mum, I’ve never driven on a road before. Maybe we should give dinner a miss’<br />
<br />
‘You are not getting out of that easily. You have done a fair bit of driving at your grandparent’s farm and we don’t need to go on a busy road. I have full confidence in your abilities. And remember to call me Paul. For tonight you are Mum’<br />
<br />
‘But I can’t drive in a dress’<br />
<br />
‘Of course you can. Half the population does it every day. What you are wearing makes no difference to how you drive’<br />
It was only a short drive and like the real Mandy said they could take back streets and avoid any traffic. 5 minutes later Paul had successfully parked the car in the car park of the restaurant. ‘Well done Mum. You did drive like an old lady but you got us here without mishap’ said the new Paul with a cheeky grin on his face.<br />
<br />
They got out of the car and a gust of wind immediately ruffled Paul’s dress. She shrieked as she managed to get it down, hopefully without anyone seeing. ‘Oh my god! You should have warned me!’<br />
<br />
‘What would be the fun in that?’<br />
<br />
‘Well you can’t blame me if I make a fool out of you. This was your idea’<br />
<br />
‘Handbag Mum. Don’t forget the handbag’ Mandy gave her handbag to Paul. ‘Wear it over your shoulder’<br />
<br />
They went inside and were ushered to a table. The waiter pulled out a chair for Paul. She tried to sit down with as much dignity as she could muster. She was very glad to see no familiar faces in the restaurant.<br />
<br />
The meal went smoothly. Paul was extra careful not to spill anything on Mandy’s dress. Chinese tasted nice whether you had Paul’s taste buds or Mandy’s. They both drank soda water. Mandy ordered one first and Paul followed suit. Once the waiter had departed Mandy told Paul. ‘I would suggest a wine but since you are driving maybe not, however once you are home you are welcome to have a glass from the bottle in the fridge. <br />
<br />
‘How are you planning to get home when the party is finished? Do I not need to come and pick you up?’<br />
<br />
‘If I can’t scrounge a lift I will catch an Uber’<br />
<br />
‘Remember what you always tell me. Don’t get a ride with anyone who has been drinking’<br />
<br />
‘We’ll make a good mother out of you yet’ said the new Paul with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Before they left the new Mandy had to visit the ladies. Her son for the night suggested ‘While in there you should brush your hair and perhaps touch up your lipstick. All you need is in your handbag’<br />
<br />
Paul tried. He was very careful applying the lipstick. It was certainly easier when someone else did it for you. She almost collided with a woman coming in as she exited. ‘Sorry’ she said as the other woman stood back to let Paul past. <br />
<br />
‘Mandy? Mandy Johnston?’<br />
<br />
Paul looked at the woman in dread. He did not know her. She knew Mandy though. Johnston was his Mum’s maiden name. ‘Ah hi’ She must have had a blank look on her face. <br />
<br />
‘You don’t remember me do you? Libby Taylor. But you knew me as Libby Thornton back in high school. It’s been a long time’<br />
‘Libby? Yes I recall’ she didn’t of course.<br />
<br />
‘I’ve just moved back into town after 20 years. I must say you have aged well you put me to shame’<br />
<br />
Paul had been thinking quickly. ‘I shouldn’t hold you up. I’m at a table near the back dining with my son. Come and say hello. He’ll be wondering what’s keeping me’<br />
<br />
‘See you soon’ Libby went into the ladies.<br />
<br />
Paul hurriedly returned to the table. Mandy nodded his approval. ‘You look nice. I was worried you might overdo the lipstick’<br />
<br />
‘I’m glad but I just ran into someone who knows this body. A woman by the name of Libby Taylor or… I forget her maiden name. She knows this body from high school and she is going to come across and say hello’<br />
<br />
‘Libby? There was a Libby Thornton in my circle of friends. She moved away to university and I haven’t seen her since’<br />
<br />
‘Well she said she has just moved back into town. Quickly tell me anything I should know about her’<br />
<br />
‘She was a basketballer. The best in our team. And she was a former girlfriend of your father. He started dating me when Libby left town. She possibly doesn’t even know I married James’ Mandy glanced past Paul ‘Oh that’s her sure enough. Just ad lib’<br />
<br />
‘Hi Mandy. Can I take a seat?’<br />
<br />
‘Sure. Pull one over. This is my son Paul’<br />
<br />
‘Hi’ said the new Paul.<br />
<br />
‘This is Libby Thornton. She was the best basketballer in my high school team’<br />
<br />
‘Hello Paul nice to meet you’ Libby turned to the real Paul ‘So you do remember me Mandy. I didn’t think I hadn’t changed that much’<br />
<br />
‘Sorry, I didn’t expect to bump into you. I haven’t seen you since well we must have been teenagers. You went off to Uni and out of my life. You were saying you have moved back into town?’<br />
<br />
‘Yes only today. My parents moved back to town last year and are giving a welcome home dinner to me and my daughter’<br />
<br />
‘Mum we need to go. Remember you have to take me to the party’ said the new Paul.<br />
<br />
‘Well I shouldn’t hold you up but I’d love to catch up with you some time? I’d love to find out what has happened to all my old friends. I’ll give you my number’ Libby wrote down a mobile number and gave it to Paul.<br />
<br />
Once Libby had departed Mandy caught the waiter’s attention and called for the bill. That was left for Paul to pay with his Mum’s credit card.<br />
<br />
He noticed Libby waving to him as he left. Sitting with her were two retirees and a young woman. She somehow looked very familiar to Paul.</p>
