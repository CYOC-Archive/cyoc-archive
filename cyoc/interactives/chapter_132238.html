<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was that time of year again. The line out the front of Asylum 137 was long, even patrons who rarely came to the club, made sure to be here for tonight.<br />
<br />
Whitney stood at the front door to the club, being a night dedicated to her magical pranking, she was involved directly with the club tonight to make sure that it went off with a problem. To the Asylum this night had become akin to nightclubs on Halloween, and the tricks will be outweighing the treats tonight.<br />
The coat check girl, Wynd, opened the door slightly. “Whitney, its time to get started”. Whitney squealed with glee and followed Wynd inside. The main lobby was decked out for the occasion: White balloons tied to just about every surface they could be tied to; even the bartender. Freeze had changes his hair colour to white, just for the occasion.<br />
Wynd motioned to the stage, where DJ Fingers sat at the ready. Whitney slipped out of her cloak, as clothing would be an inconvenience in this club and revealed her attire for the night: Nothing but a tiny g-string and white pasties over her nipples, she didn&#39;t need anything else as it would just get in the way.<br />
<br />
10pm came around and the patrons began filing into the lobby, everyone eager to get the event started. At least two hundred people had made their way, and that number would just increase as the night goes on, and they were getting excited, Freeze madly sliding drinks this way and that.<br />
The Owner, stood in the middle of the stage, microphone in hand as DJ Fingers slowly turned the volume down, signalling the speech was about to begin. “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Annual Whitney Prank-Off!” the room booming with cheers.<br />
“Now for everyone here, old and new, the rules are simple: Everyone has been given a stamp with Whitney&#39;s face on it; if you gets stamped there is a 100 percent chance you will be &#39;boob-ified&#39; , and if you dont know what that is, youll find out soon enough. Now if you boobify someone you can attach them to yourself by simply pressing the stamped skin against your own. But there is a catch!<br />
Every extra breast you &#39;acquire&#39; drops the success of your future stamps by a few percent so be warned, as the night goes on it will get trickier. Secondly, you received a stamp with the face of our own coat check girl Wynd; if you get stamped by it you will be frozen in place for thirty seconds, but you can be boobified during that time so dont worry. The winner will be the first person with 30  boob acquisitions. The game begins in twenty minutes and all rooms are open. Lets the game BEGIN!” <br />
There were huge cheers from the crown as people milled about, getting ready for the chaos that was going to unfold. Whitney made her way off the stage and wandered over to Freeze, who once again was in a flurry trying to get all the drinks out. “Vodka and raspberry sexy” She said as she leant on the counter drawing the attention of at least a dozen people. “You had better be ready, everyone is gunning for you this year”. “They can try” Whitney laughed “but i&#39;m the master of trickery here”.<br />
<br />
Downing her drink quickly, Whitney made her way up the spiral staircase, entering a room with a neon picture of a chair; this is where she will make her move.<br />
No one had yet come into this room, most people would be swarming over each other in the chaos in the lobby for the first few minutes, then scatter around.<br />
A sudden siren sounded throughout the building, signifying the start of the contest. Whitney could hear the happy screams of the patrons running around, wildly boobifying each other. <br />
Whitey decided before hand to use the effects of this room to her advantage; the furniture room would change those inside into any furniture or fixture the individual commanded. Whitney looked to the elaborate chandelier overhead and called “oriental rug!”.<br />
Whitney&#39;s skin began to shift, becoming coarser and gaining a beautiful patten seen commonly in those rugs while her body as a whole started to get thinner as her torso widened. With a giggle, she lay on the floor and allowed herself to spread out over the area.<br />
<br />
A few minutes pass and sure enough, three women walk into the room, two still normal while one had at least a dozen extra breasts hanging off of her, all in different skin colour and shape; they covered her front and one on each knee. As they approached Whitney felt their feet standing on top of her, it was time to spring the trap.<br />
“Can you two slow down. It&#39;s hard to keep up with so much extra weight” the many breasted woman said. “Dont worry Scar, this plan will work out great, they will never expect us to team up like this, you just need to be our boob carrier”. With them all looking around Whitney willed herself back into her old form, hands and feet forming quickly in the corners.<br />
With a sudden jerk, Whitney sprung the trap whipping out from under them and sending them all to the ground. Amid the squeals of surprise Whitney used both stamps, tapping each normal woman on the ankle, the blonde froze mid fall, landing like a posed toy doll on her side, while the blue haired girl barely made it to the floor before her swelling body engulfed her arms and legs. As whitney gained her full form she looked on at the boob-woman, who simply smiled as her lips puckered and pressed out into a nipple, which stood amazingly hard atop the breast as it jiggled to a halt. <br />
Whitney then turned to the frozen figure who at that time unfroze and splayed out. She quickly spun around, stamp in hand, and noticed her multibreasted friends was stuck trying to get up with all the extra weight holding her down, and then her other friend, who was simply a b-cup perky breast sitting silently near her.<br />
“Missy” the woman called as she scrambled to the lone boob. She picked her up and smiled saying “well at least you will contribute to our score” before her smile dropped at the feeling of pressure on her back “my thoughts exactly” Whitney said, removing the stamp from the woman&#39;s back. The surprised woman flopping forwards, dropping the lone boob in the process as her arms and legs rapidly sucked into her form. She rolled over as her body rounded, a nipple forming out of her belly button. “Next time” The woman said as her head lost definition and flowed into her body, shrinking down to a very nice d-cup. <br />
Walking seductively over to the flailing multibreasted woman, Whitney said “mmmm I love it when they jiggle; sweetie, a tip for next time: placement of the breasts is everything” and with that she tapped the flailing redhead on top of her head, causing it to immediately morph and sink into her form. As she transformed, all of here additional breasts fell off her, scattering all over the floor in various directions, as their owners form finally finished , her pussy closing up and pushing out into a quivering light pink nipple.<br />
<br />
Whitney was now well ahead of what she had planned, all up there were fifteen breasts surrounding her, half way to her victory yet again. She picked up the closest breast to her; a tanned c-cup with a dark nipple “First things first” Whitney whispered to herself as she placed the first breast on the back of her neck, humming dreamily to herself as it fused with her skin.<br />
One by one she picked up the soft mammaries, placing them at particular spots all over her body: one on each arse cheek, a line of breasts running down her spine to meet them. Next Whitney placed one of each earlobe, smaller ones around a-cup size so as to not weight her down too much. Two large breasts, she guessed e-cup, were placed over her wrists flopping over her hands. The final three, the girls who entered the room to begin with, were placed in a line under Whitney&#39;s own breasts “There you go lovelies, thanks for giving me a head start”.<br />
<br />
Whitney could feel them all, their raw emotions flooding into her head, they all were engulfed in an aura of sexual bliss, moaning into Whitney&#39;s own psyche. “calm down lovelies, the fun isnt over yet” and with that made her way back into the lobby.<br />
Upon walking into the lobby, Whitney saw the aftermath of the first few minutes of the contest: at least 50 people were still stamping each other madly, some frozen, some already breastified. The chaos was still going with spectators watching, they stood at the stage watching on a projector screen the contest unravelling. <br />
Whitney creeped past a few people, and slipped into the laser tag area, she knew there would be other hiding in there.<br />
<br />
The smoke machines and flashing lights made for an absolutely glorious hunt, creeping around the side of a bunker she heard heavy breathing inside. Looking around the corner she saw why: there was a man, with two breasts under his pecs, one hand rubbing a breast while the other fondled his rock hard cock. On closer inspection his drifting hand kept moving to his balls and Whiteney noticed it: the man had placed two more breasts over his balls, giving the base of his cock a tit-job while her stroked up the shaft. <br />
Whitney bided her time, waiting for the right moment, and then it came, literally. As soon as the man began to orgasm Whitney dove at him, tapping him on the cock head as he began to shoot his load. With a sudden jolt he snapped out of his bliss, and was barely able to say “damn” before his body sucked in on itself, dropping the four other breasts to the way side.<br />
“thats what you get for being too horny” Whitney chuckled as she lifted up the quite firm breast the man used to be, and with a sly grin, placed the breast over her pussy, moaning as the flesh engulfed her opening and fused in place. The other four breasts , Whitney placed above her arse-breasts, evening out the area. “Only ten more to go” she cheered and made for the exit, if there was anyone else here, they would have come when they heard the man&#39;s moans.<br />
<br />
The game was going faster than Whitney had anticipated; the building overflowing with the laughs and squeals of contestants and spectators alike. As Whitney made her way back into the main lobby, she saw her chance: a woman stood in the center of the main lobby covered in breasts, she had to have the same, if not more than Whitney, if she could tag this woman now, her victory would be all but assured.<br />
Whitney had a strategy, she flopped the wrist breasts over her hands, obscuring them completely, and stumbled into the room, pretending to be out of breath “I fell and landed on two boobs and now ive lost my hands. You might as well tag me, as I cant do anything now” The woman turned around and grinned from ear to ear “This is it, this year i&#39;ll beat Whitney at her own game!” and lunged at whitney, stamp in hand. In a flash Whitney side stepped her and brought around her obscured hand from under the wrist-breast, tapping the girl on the arse. “Fooled you, didnt I?” Whitney laughed. But suddenly the woman turned, the stamp didnt work! The success rate goes down the more breasts you have so Whitney must have hit her with a dud.<br />
“Luck is on my side” said the girl and pounced on Whitney. A struggle ensued, rippling mounds of breast flesh jiggled wildly as the two women wrestled to tap the other on bare skin, Whitney then shouted “catch!” and threw her stamp at he womans head. The woman swiftly moved her head out of the way and laughed “you missed, now you cant boobify me, idiot” and pressed her chest down onto Whitney, teasing her with breast flesh while laughing manically. Suddenly she stopped laughing, her face frozen in a smile. Whitney pushed the woman off her as the crowd gasped, Whitney&#39;s was frozen solid, but Whitney&#39;s hands were empty.<br />
Reaching up to her own cavernous cleavage she produced the reason: the freezing stamp was concealed in her bust the whole time, and when the woman pressed down on her it made contact.<br />
The crowd cheered at Whitney&#39;s ingenuity. <br />
<br />
Victory was all but assured for Whitney now, as she grabbed her boobifying stamp off the ground and tapped the gasping woman the moment she came our of her freezing. “I&#39;ll get you back” the woman breathed as her form rounded out and shrunk, her breast collection falling all around her.<br />
Whitney picked up the woman as she finished her transformation placing her at the top of her forehead, like some bizarre unicorn, and proudly stood up to show off her trophy before she took her victory. In that moment the cheering stopped and people gasped, Whitney&#39;s smile dropping as she turned to see her own printed face between her eyes. <br />
“Surprise!” Wynd called out, and tapped Whitney lightly, her form ballooning and reforming as her breast collection exploded off her. The last thing Whitney saw as her face lost definition, was Wynd&#39;s cheeky grin as she dove into the huge pile of breasts.<br />
<br />
Wynd got to her feet, she had easily gained more than thirty breasts as her quivering form was filled nearly head to toe. Wynd&#39;s face said it all, her smile and one eye was all that was left under all of the boobs attached to even her head.<br />
“Looks like our very own Wynd is the winner!” The Owner announced to the cheers of the crowd.<br />
 <br />
Whitney couldnt hear any of it however, but in her mind, she sighed and began plotting her revenge amid jolts of pleasure from Wynds questing fingers.</p>
