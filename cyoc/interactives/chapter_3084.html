<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was watching his friends--Hank, Paulie, Brian and Ian--having a blast at the pool and enjoying their new bodies. it was weird the way they had totally accepted their new forms and were very much making the most out of it. Hank and Ian went out of the pool and started a posedown just to find out which between the two of them had the better body. There was no contest, really. Although Ian's 6'4&quot; physique was very impressive, bodybuilder-size Hank blew Ian out of the water with muscles to spare thanks to the extra growth Ty afforded him. Still, it was a sight to behold--two big strong men flexing and trying to one-up each other with Brian and Paulie cheering them on. Totally hot!
<br />

<br />
Ty was happy that they were enjoying themselves and was about to join in the fun as well when he suddenly had flash of inspiration. What if he &quot;invited&quot; a few more people to their pool party, in particular, the lifeguard and the two sunbathers whom he mindzapped earlier to disregard anything out of the ordinary. After all as the saying goes, the more, the merrier, and Ty went on to start with the lifeguard.
<br />

<br />
For all this time, the lifeguard was blissfully unaware of the events that were unfolding right before his very eyes. From time to time he'd give the four boys a friendly warning not to play too rough but for the most part he left them alone and just sat on his chair and kept a watchful eye over the pool. Unlike the four former boys, the lifeguard already had a body he could be proud of. He stood at around 5'10&quot;, weighed in at around 180 lbs., and had a better-than-average swimmer's build.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Let's see if I can't make something that good just a little bit better.&quot; Ty thought for a moment and released a quick burst of energy directed towards the lifeguard and the transformation immediately began. Due to Ty's mental influence, the lifeguard didn't even realize anything was happening to his own body. If he had, he would have noticed that he had gotten a bit taller by around 4&quot; and gained around 30 lbs. of muscle distributed evenly all over his body. The only thing that he did find strangely uncomfortable were the trunks he was wearing that had become much tighter. Apparently his original penis was only an average 6 inches when hard and Ty decided to double the fun.
<br />

<br />
Next were the sunbathers. They were a couple of middle-aged men who were frequent visitors to the pool during weekends. After a quick telepathic scan, Ty learned that their names were Chris and Alex and the two had been living together for the past 10 years. The 40-year-olds had been best friends since high school and their relationship progressed to a more intimate level throughout college. As a former football player, Chris was still an imposing 6'1&quot; figure albeit a bit overweight thanks to the stress from work and his poor eating habits. Alex, on the other hand, wasn't an athlete but kept his lithe 5'11&quot; frame through years of constant jogging, something he could never get Gary involved in. Chris and Alex were sleeping on their lounge chairs with their hands clasped together. Ty was quite touched at this public display of affection and decided to do something special for them.
<br />

<br />
At first nothing seemed to be happening, but slowly the changes Ty had initiated became evident. Ty saw Chris's body contract gradually while Alex's started to expand at the same rate. As chunky Chris began losing his excess poundage and a little bit of height, Alex's muscles gained more mass and he grew somewhat taller. What Ty was actually doing was he was transferring physical attributes from Chris to Alex and vice versa, and, at the same, eliminating unwanted traits and enhancing other characteristics. In addition, Ty was also regressing both men and shaving off at least twenty years. Both of their haircuts were trimmed down to a military-style crewcut. Lastly, their faces morphed until they resembled each other with Ty retaining and combining their best features. In the end, Chris and Alex were exact copies of each other, 6-foot 21-year-old twins wearing identical blue speedos and with bodies to die for. During the entire time of their transformation, not once did they let go of each other's hands.
<br />

<br />
Ty then proceeded to the next phase of his plan. &quot;Time for a little fun.&quot; He approached the pool and started calling out for Brian.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Brian, are you here? Your dad said you'd be here with the guys.&quot;
<br />

<br />
When Brian saw Ty, he shouted back, &quot;Ty, get your butt over here. You're not going to believe what happened to us!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Ty briskly walked the rest of the way to the pool area and saw his latest works all gathered in and around the pool. &quot;OK,&quot; he thought. &quot;I'll just remove my earlier command from Chris, Alex, and the lifeguard and take it from there.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; exclaimed Ty all the while pretending to be surprised. &quot;Brian, what the fuck happened to you?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;It isn't just me! Look at everyone else.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hi Ty!&quot; beamed Paulie. &quot;How you doin'?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yeah, Ty,&quot; Ian added. &quot;How's it hanging?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Guys, is that really you?&quot; Ty thought he should be receiving an Academy award for his acting.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Indubitably so,&quot; Hank responded. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;How did this happen?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;We don't know,&quot; replied Paulie. &quot;One minute we were normal high school kids; the next minute...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I guess it started with me and my dad,&quot; said Brian. &quot;I still don't know why this happened, but like what I told these guys, I ain't complaining.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Whoa, I'm starting to feel a bit dizzy.&quot; Ty decided that it was time for a little fun and acted as if he was getting sick.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Ty, hey man, you don't look so good,&quot; noticed Ian.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Now, it's my turn,&quot; smiled Ty as he started changing his own body to something a lot more presentable. Ty slowly stretched himself to a full 6'3&quot; height and pumped himself up to 220 lbs. of grade-A all-American beef. His 48&quot; chest, 33&quot; waist, 20&quot; guns and 10&quot; cock were truly something to behold. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Aaargh! What's happening to me.&quot; Ty was very much enjoying the act he was putting on. From the corner of his eye, he could see his dumbfounded friends with their jaws dropped in shock (and awe) at the scene playing before them. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Ty, are you all right?&quot; Brian and everyone else at that were genuinely worried. Hank and Ian were about to rush to Ty's side when he doubled over and let himself fall into the pool to heighten the dramatic effect. Even before someone had a chance to call for help, the lifeguard had already jumped in the pool to save Ty.
<br />

<br />
In a matter of minutes, the lifeguard had Ty back on the side of the pool with his friends hovering him. &quot;Hey man, can you hear me? Are you all right?&quot; asked the lifeguard.
<br />

<br />
&quot;*cough cough* I think I'm all right. I think I just swallowed some water.&quot; Ty gazed into the face of the man of had just pulled him out of the pool and became besmitten by it. &quot;God, he looks better than I thought.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh, man, you scared the shit out of us.&quot; Ian was visibly relieved.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Are you sure you're ok?&quot; asked Brian.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I'm fine. But hey look, I'm one of you guys now.&quot; Ty was showing off his new body.
<br />

<br />
&quot;That's certainly to be the case,&quot; Hank replied. &quot;You look fine, no, better than ever!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Ty then turned his attention to the lifeguard.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Thanks for saving me. I'm Ty, by the way.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sean&quot; the lifeguard replied offering his hand which Ty firmly shook. &quot;That was some weird shit I just saw happen to you. I still can't believe it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know. And my friends, too. They weren't like this yesterday.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I mean they were like me, not now, but a while ago. We were just kids. How about you, are you sure nothing's happened to you?&quot; Ty was fishing for a reaction.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Me? No, I don't think so...&quot; Sean looked down and saw his new body for the first time. &quot;Oh, shit! You're right! It got to me too!&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Looks like we're all in the boat,&quot; grinned Ty. &quot;And oh, is that a banana in your speedo or are you just happy to see me?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sean was estatic upon discovering his new-and-improved tool. &quot;Holy Mother of God! This keeps getting better and better!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Better believe it!&quot; And with that, Ty let loose a wave of sexual energy that passed through everyone around the pool. 
<br />

<br />
The first ones to be affected were Chris and Alex. All the commotion had woken them up from their nap and then they saw each other for the first time all over again. It took them a while to realize who the other person was and that they now looked exactly alike. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Chris, is that really you?&quot; Alex reached out and touched Chris's face.
<br />

<br />
&quot;It's me, Alex.&quot; Chris tenderly held Alex's hand upon his cheek.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh, God. What happened to us?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I don't know but all I do know right now is that I want to kiss you.&quot; Chris leapt out of his lounge chair and he and Alex started making out.
<br />

<br />
At the same time, Brian tackled Paulie to the ground and drove his tongue into Paulie's mouth while stroking the Italian's cock through his trunks. Ian was on his knees worshipping every muscled-inch of Hank and running his fingers through every bump and crevice.
<br />

<br />
Ty and Sean were in each other's arms and relishing each other's manliness. Ty then knelt down, pulled down Sean's speedos and released the throbbing monster within. Before Sean knew it, Ty had engulfed his entire cock and was sucking it crazy.
<br />

<br />
Chris and Alex had chucked their swimmear and were giving each other blowjobs.
<br />

<br />
Brian tore off Paulie's trunk with his teeth and devoured his hairy nuts. Paulie was babbling from the sheer pleasure of it all.
<br />

<br />
While Ian was giving Hank a tongue-bath of a lifetime, Ty was still working on Sean's foot-long dick making sure he didn't neglect an inch.
<br />

<br />
For the next ten minutes, each pair was enjoying their respective partners immensely. None of them had cum because Ty was still saving the best for last. He looked up and did a quick look-see at what had been happening.
<br />

<br />
Chris and Alex were still 69ing each other; Brian was now rimming Paulie; and Ian and Hank were giving each other handjobs in a contest on who could make the other cum first.
<br />

<br />
Ty laid back on the ground, lifted his legs and gave his ass to Sean to fuck. It was strange at first having a 12&quot; cock up his ass but Ty couldn't deny how much he loved having it there and especially when it started moving in and out of him. Within minutes, he felt his orgasm slowly building and Ty realized he wouldn't be able to hold it back for long.
<br />

<br />
The moment he felt his cock expand, Ty knew this was the moment he was waiting for and released another burst of sexual energy at very point of his climax. Everyone else starting cumming all at the same time .
<br />

<br />
Ropes of jism flew all around the pool. All of them were screaming and shouting. 
<br />

<br />
When it was all done, there were eight exhausted but very satisfied men all around the pool wondering what else good happen to them.</p>
