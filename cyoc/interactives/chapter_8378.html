<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Saul chuckles to himself.  Poor Tim must have passed out from exhaustion.  Which he was almost going to do as well ... except he had a mess to clean up.  He looked at the immediate area, and grinned inwardly.  &quot;There has to be like 4 gallons of fox cum here&quot;  He says quietly to himself.  Saul carefully hefts up Timothy into his arms, and trudges to the bedroom, where he lays Tim down in bed, and pulls the comforter over him.  It was then Saul noticed that there was a cum trail leading from where he picked up Timothy, to where he placed him in bed.  Not just a drop or two here and there, but more like a little river.  Saul sighed to himself, more he'd have to clean up.  Not that he minded this chore.  Thankfully, Tim is a very heavy sleeper.  <br />
<br />
Saul went and got the wet dry vac, and began cleaning up Tim's mess.  And he was obviously tired too.  After what he just unloaded, it's no wonder.  Saul went about cleaning up any spooge he saw.  After working for about 10 minutes, the vaccuum shut itself off.  Saul muttered &quot;Stupid cheap ass ancient wiring&quot;  He walked over to the wall socket, unplugged the vaccuum, then went to another socket on a different wall, and plugged it in.  Still nothing.  He inspected the prongs, just in case he had bent one.  They were fine.  He went and checked the fuse panel.  All the fuses looked alright.<br />
<br />
Saul then stops, standing right in front of the vaccuum &quot;No way ...&quot;  Saul says, as he unhinges the vaccuum from the bucket ... lo and behold, the vaccuum was full of Tim's spunk, and there was a little more to clean up!  Saul blinks and looks at the vaccuum lid.  He reads off '3 gallon black and decker wet/dry shop vac' &quot;No way ...&quot;  Saul repeats, but there's the evidence right there, a 3 gallon wet dry vac, full of vulpine juice.<br />
<br />
Saul goes to dump it down the sink, but he realises that the sink can't hold that much.  So he trods into the bathroom with it, and begins pouring it into the bathtub.  Saul is even having trouble with the consistency of it.  It's like cornstarch and water, but a little more fluidic.  Saul repeats this process one last time, and heads to the bathtub again, this time with about an inch more vulpine spooge to add to the rest.  Noting to himself that the tub hasn't really drained all that well since his last visit.  <br />
<br />
Saul begins thinking logically to himself, trying not to believe what he knows is true.  'this drain has always been slow ... yeah, that's what it is.'  Saul sighs to himself 'No, Saul ... your ex is now a human shaped fox, with a cock that would make a draft horse cry.'  Saul tried to take this all in, he really did.  This was just too much to absorb, kind of like Timothy's cum and the drain.<br />
<br />
After cleaning up, Saul took a quick shower and decided to hop into bed, with the still snoozing Timothy.  Saul was rather tired himself, and threw a cover over himself, falling asleep next to the fox that is his boss, Tim.  Saul knew he wouldn't get much sleep.  Visions of Timothy's absolutely huge cock, and accompanying balls quickly got him hard again.  Leave it to Tim to play to his size fetish, even if it was accidental.  Saul slept then, with that thought in his head.<br />
<br />
Throughout the night, Saul had to tug some covers back onto himself.  Tim was definetly a cover hog.  He even remembered back when Tim intentionally stole the covers, and wrapped himself up in them so that Saul would have to sleep directly next to him, like a sleeping bag that wasn't meant for two people, but was being used that way anyway.  Saul got rather fed up with having to tug the covers over onto himself for about the 12th time, untill he pulled a little too hard and stirred Timothy out of his sleep.<br />
<br />
Saul was the first to discover why Timothy was hogging the sheets, followed almost immediately by Timothy, who seemed just as stunned as Saul was.  Saul reached out and tried to feel through the covers if that was really Timothy or not.  It felt real, but it couldn't be ...<br />
No, it couldn't be.  Tim was probably using his leg to keep the covers up like that.  Saul pulled back the covers to check Tim's feet, and ... there were two.  Saul looked back at the tip, of the monsterous still covered erection that Timothy has.  Sure enough, there is a large wet spot accumulating at the peak.<br />
<br />
Saul peeled back the covers, and to both his and Tim's amazement, Tim was hung.  He was sporting an erection that had to be as big arond as his thigh at the meatiest part, and was at least as long as his leg, if not more.  His balls were just outrageous.  Having run out of room between his thighs, his right one had spilled over the side of his leg.  Tim at this time, was amazed, slowly rubbing at his cock.  <br />
Saul caught himself drooling over such a huge cock.  He shook his head a bit.  &quot;Jesus Tim, I've heard of morning wood, but I've never seen someone with morning tree!&quot;  Tim blinked, and laughed.  &quot;Well, I guess you'll have to get used to it, just like I will.&quot;  Tim said, as he tried to shimmy his way out of bed.  The sheer weight of his cock made it difficult.  But once he got momentum going, he was able to swing his legs over the side of the bed.  Standing up was fairly difficult, and what came next had Tim seeing stars.<br />
<br />
The second Tim stood up, his centre of gravity was knocked out of alignment, and his towering spire of flesh flumped forward, slapping wetly on the ground.  Tim yelped, more in suprise than pain.  He managed to waddle to the bathroom, and do his thing.  When he returned, his length had softened some, but was still rediculously large on his frame.  &quot;I wonder when it's going to stop growing, or even if it will&quot;  Tim asked.  Saul replied &quot;Does it have to?&quot;  They both chuckled a little.<br />
<br />
That actually gave Saul an idea, maybe the box could do the same for him.  Saul went into the room with the box to find out.</p>
