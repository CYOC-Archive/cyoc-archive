<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake opened up the bag that was labeled, &quot;Outfit&quot; and pulled out six yellow thongs, along with a clip-on tail, and a headband with ears. The clothing was tagged as &quot;Lion&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, at least I&#39;ll be able to get to be a cool looking animal. I just hope they&#39;re not lying to me.&quot; Jake mused to himself as he started to stripped out from his normal clothes and took a moment to look at himself.<br />
<br />
He was a bit muscular for a 15-year-old, but lithe that the result of track and football since fifth grade while also leading the junior varsity swim team, and went to the gym weekly to keep in shape. As far as development goes is where he was tall for his age and he was very well endowed, but despite all of this that he couldn&#39;t grow a single hair on his body, even his face.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long for Jack to simply slip on the yellow thong as it was feeling uncomfortable. true it had to be the softest material he had ever felt, but he did felt mostly exposed and didn&#39;t like the way it hugged between his crotch and rear. His package was large as it was evident through the cloth that he was embarrassed as he had to work like this for one weekend, but the $9,000 paycheck was too alluring for a prize to quit because of a little discomfort. Jake swallowed his pried as he decided that he would just have to get used to it. after all, It was only for one weekend.<br />
<br />
Once After he was done putting on his thong as he then was finishing off with his new animal parts that Jake placed his pillows and sleeping bag on the bunk and stowed the bag underneath. The only thing left to do was to drink whatever was in that vial as he pulled out the stopper and decided to gulp it down quickly, for he feared that it wouldn&#39;t taste so good. He was relieved when the drink tasted ever so slightly like raw meat that Jake felt a sudden warm feeling flow throughout his body as he felt very happy and eager, though he didn&#39;t know for what.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright in there?&quot; came Lago&#39;s voice from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m ok! you can come on in now!&quot; Jake answered.<br />
<br />
The other three boys came back into the room and immediately began to talk about Jake&#39;s uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;a Lion?&quot; Onca nodded his head in approval. &quot;that&#39;s cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;it would seem that the two of you are now cousins, right Onca?&quot; Fennec said while joking.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve had a Lion here.&quot; Lago mused quietly to himself. &quot;Hey, we need to come up with your nickname!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about Fang?&quot; Fennec suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, its unpredictable, but isn&#39;t it for a wolf?&quot; Onca said.<br />
<br />
&quot;how about Leo?&quot; Lago suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, too predictable.&quot; Onca said.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, how about Saruni?&quot; Fennec suggested with a teas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sar...who?&quot; Onca asked while tilting his head to one side in confusion.<br />
<br />
every one was giving suggestions that Onca soon came with a name that Jake liked the most. &quot;how about Kiba?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiba,&quot;  Jake repeated, &quot;I like the sound of that, sounds good to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Kiba it is then. now then, let&#39;s show you around.&quot; Lago said as he led Jake, now Kiba, out of the room and back into the hallway while Fennec and Onca elected to stay behind. The first room they went to was the bar room again.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is where you&#39;ll do most of you&#39;re work, Kiba.&quot; Lago explained. &quot;Your exact job will be assigned and explained tomorrow, but just so you know where to show up in the morning. The bartender&#39;s name is Brer as he&#39;s a bear, but he&#39;s really nice and will help you with whatever you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean all the employees are animals, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, it&#39;s actually pretty cool. The bouncers are Chuck and Clint. Chuck&#39;s a tiger and Clint&#39;s a lion, like you. They&#39;re big, intimidating, and don&#39;t say much, but they really watch out for the workers. The owner and the manager is Oswald, but everyone calls him Ozzy as He&#39;s an otter. He&#39;s very nice and friendly and does his best to keep this place nice. Other than that, no one else is really full-time, some even work for just a day, then leave. Me and an older kid are the only two all-summer junior staff, but he&#39;s a leopard janitor, so I&#39;ve never really talked with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many other kids are there working here?&quot; Jake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are about a dozen of kids working this weekend. You and three others are completely new, some others have been here before, and some, like Fennec and Onca, have been working for a couple of weeks now. You can stay as long as you like and leave whenever you want. A position will always be open for you. now then, Let&#39;s go back in the hallway and I&#39;ll show you the bathroom and break room.&quot; Lago said.<br />
<br />
The bathroom was set-up like a public pool bath house, but as clean and tidy as a hotel&#39;s. The break room consisted of couches and chairs, a TV, a kitchenette, and an air hockey table. The final stop before heading back to their room was Ozzy&#39;s office where Lago told Jake he could take any questions or concerns. before they entered back into the room Jack was once in, Lago knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why knock? It&#39;s our room, and it&#39;s not like they&#39;re doing anything.&quot; Jake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;lets just say that it&#39;s better just to be sure.&quot; Lago said. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s polite and we&#39;re supposed to be friendly and well-mannered when we work here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake saw the reasoning, but still thought it was unnecessary. Either way, the door was opened by Fennec and the two boys went inside. Jake hadn&#39;t realized how late it was, but the alarm clock on the table between the bunks read 10:00.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better get to sleep,&quot; Lago said, &quot;We have to be in the bar room by 7:00.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust us, Kiba.&quot; Onca added &quot;You&#39;ll need the sleep that by the time tomorrow, you&#39;ll gonna love it here.&quot;</p>
