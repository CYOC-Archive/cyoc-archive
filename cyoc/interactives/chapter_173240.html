<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jo saw a pretty girl.  She was younger than Jo was, but very tall for a girl.  She had short, boyish hair, and was very cute.  She had dark brown hair and wore a long blue dress with a pink floral pattern.  &quot;I wish I could see what she looked like without clothes!&quot;<br />
<br />
To her, it looked like the girl&#39;s clothes turned into a fog, then a mist, and then she saw her in all her glory...Jo was a lesbian, but she&#39;d never met another girl who returned her affections.  Oh there were girls she knew who were curious, to be sure, but none who were willing to openly enter a relationship with another girl- so Jo had never done anything more than make out with a girl,<br />
<br />
As a result, she felt very lonely and sexually frustrated.  At first she smiled as the girl&#39;s body was revealed...but then she frowned as she realized this was no girl, but a boy!  A very pretty, androgynous boy, but a boy nonetheless.  Rather than be disgusted (as she felt no attraction for guys), she was intrigued.<br />
<br />
She walked up to him.  &quot;I wish he&#39;d want to be friends with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery sighed.  Her life was so complicated!  She&#39;d been born a boy, but she&#39;d always been very feminine in appearance.  When she was young, she&#39;d see how pretty girls were, and wished she could wear dresses.  She wanted to play with dolls, but her father had rejected any feminine behavior from his son.<br />
<br />
One day, he&#39;d caught Avery trying on a dress, and beat her within an inch of her life.  She&#39;d been taken away from her parents, and spent months in the hospital, recovering.  Her aunt Lila had custody of her now- she&#39;d been lucky that Lila was both supportive of Avery&#39;s desire to explore her feminine side, and wealthy enough to pay for not only the hospital fees and extensive physical therapy, but also surgery to remove her scars- as well as some cosmetic surgery to make Avery more feminine in appearance.<br />
<br />
Now that Avery was 14, she found herself at a crossroads.  She could take pills and undergo surgery to eventually transition into a full woman.  But would that really make her happy, to be a fake woman?  Or was she better off as she was, neither male nor female, but in a way, both?<br />
<br />
Then again, who would accept her?  She felt lonely, and afraid to reveal her true nature to even her closest friends.  Then a girl walked up to her.  Avery smiled softly as she saw the girl.  She was older, maybe 15, with black hair and blue eyes.  Shorter than average height, but not tiny.  Pretty but not gorgeous.  An average-sized bust that Avery was instantly jealous of, and a figure that was...well not average, but definitely not voluptuous.  But she seemed friendly, and Avery really wanted a friend.<br />
<br />
If anything, the boy was prettier close up than he&#39;d been from afar.  &#39;He&#39;s prettier than me, that&#39;s so unfair!&#39;  She felt her breath catch in her throat when she saw the boy&#39;s pretty emerald eyes.  Even though she knew for a fact that he as a boy, she felt like her heart skipped a beat- he was so hot!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, sorry, I saw your dress and I wanted to compliment you on it, it&#39;s very pretty.&quot;  Not that she could see the dress now, but it was pretty.<br />
<br />
Avery blushed and looked downward, her long lashes fluttering demurely.  The effect was only slightly marred by his height, he looked to be about 5&#39; 9&quot;, compared to Jo&#39;s own 5&#39; 4&quot; frame.  &quot;Thank you.  I&#39;m Avery.&quot;  She held out her hand.<br />
<br />
Jo took it with a smile.  &quot;Pleased to meet you, I&#39;m Jo.  Well, Joella, actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to be called Jo, I&#39;m fine with that.&quot;  Avery flashed a dazzling smile that took Jo&#39;s breath away.<br />
<br />
&#39;Holy fuck, I&#39;m attracted to a boy?  He&#39;s lovely...&#39;  &quot;So what are you doing, Avery?&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery seemed flustered.  &quot;I...had a doctor&#39;s appointment...but I&#39;m free now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A doctor?&quot;  Jo was curious.<br />
<br />
Avery looked like she wanted to cry.  &quot;A...specialist, yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
The poor thing, Jo just wanted to hug her!  &quot;I know we just met, but I wish you could trust me, Avery.  I want to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery sniffled a bit and sat down on a nearby park bench.  Jo sat next to the boy...or should she think of him as a girl?  He was girlier than she was, that&#39;s for sure!<br />
<br />
&quot;I..I&#39;m not really a girl.  I was seeing a doctor who specialized in...gender reassignment.&quot;  Avery didn&#39;t know why she was trusting a stranger, and watched her face carefully for any sign of disgust or rejection.<br />
<br />
But she didn&#39;t see anything like that from Jo.  Only concern.  &quot;Do you want to be a girl, Avery?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I don&#39;t know.  I mean, I&#39;d love to be able to be treated like a girl.  For people to accept me.  But it&#39;s going to be a long and difficult choice.  And I&#39;ll never...really be one, you know.  They can give me breasts, and surgically alter my genitals so I look...female.  But I&#39;ll have to take pills for the rest of my life.  And I wonder if I&#39;m not better off this way.  But...who would accept me?  I&#39;m a freak either way!&quot;  At this, Avery burst into tears.<br />
<br />
Jo put her arms around the boy...no, definitely girl...and held her.  By the time Avery was done crying, she was laying on the bench, her head in Jo&#39;s lap, and Jo was stroking her hair.<br />
<br />
A muscular teen boy walked by.  &quot;Jeez, get a room, you lezzies!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jo giggled.  Normally she&#39;d be pissed off, but she supposed that&#39;s what she looked like, a girl comforting a beautiful young maiden.<br />
<br />
Avery, on the other hand, was furious.  She sat up and glared at the boy, her normally pretty features contorted into a scowl of pure rage.  &quot;Fuck you, asshole!  You can call me a freak, but don&#39;t you dare say that to my friend!&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked about ready to jump this guy, and despite the fact the other boy looked like he could tear Avery in half, Jo wasn&#39;t sure who would be more fucked up afterwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what?&quot;  Jo held up her hand with the ring on it&#39;s finger as she looked to the guy.  &quot;You picked the wrong day to be a jackass.  I wish you were the tiniest, prettiest, girliest freshman lesbian I&#39;ve ever seen.  I wish you always acted meek and girly, and that everyone who knows you will believe you&#39;ve always been that way, even though you&#39;ll know the truth.  I wish you were filled with an uncontrollable desire to be dominated completely by another girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
An unseen wind whipped around Jo, ruffling Avery&#39;s dress and hair, then it struck the guy.  He dwindled in size so quickly he seemed to vanish into his shirt and crumpled to the ground.  Then with a soft moan, the boy sat up, his shirt hanging on him like a dress.  But he was no longer a boy.<br />
<br />
With a flawless complexion and soft, doll-like features, the newly-minted girl gasped in shock.  She had light blue eyes and shoulder length hair that was dyed a light pink color.  She looked to be all of 4&#39; 9&quot;, with small, but perfect breasts.  She seemed to have no body hair, but as she tried to stand up, Jo could see very fine ash blonde hair between her legs.  Crying, the girl ran away, leaving her pants and shoes (which her tiny feet had slipped right out of) behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...what...how?&quot;  Avery&#39;s eyes were huge as she gaped at Jo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, I sort of have a magic ring that grants wishes.&quot;  Jo shrugged.<br />
<br />
Avery didn&#39;t question it, as she instantly believed anything Jo said.  &quot;R..really...?  Do you think...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jo smiled at Avery.  &quot;Do you want to try being a girl, and see if you like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery just nodded, looking so hopeful that Jo felt her heart melt.  The poor girl!  &quot;I wish you were 100% female in every way, Avery!&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery&#39;s body seemed to shudder, and she shrank in size, until she was just a bit shorter than Jo.  A pair of breasts formed on her flat chest, and soon she had a larger bust than Jo did, a healthy looking C cup.  Her hips widened a bit, and her waist narrowed.  And most amazingly of all, her genitals shrank away to nothing, leaving her momentarily genderless, before a slit formed between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God!&quot;  Avery looked down her shirt, and only and effort of will made her not immediately reach under her dress to check between her legs.  &quot;It&#39;s true...oh it&#39;s true...&quot;  She embraced Jo, pressing her lips against the now taller girl.<br />
<br />
Jo was surprised, but pleasantly so.  Avery&#39;s lips were soft and warm.<br />
<br />
Avery suddenly pried herself away.  &quot;Oh I&#39;m so sorry!&quot;  She looked around, wondering what people would think.<br />
<br />
Jo put her hand on Avery&#39;s arm.  &quot;Shh, honey, it&#39;s ok.  You&#39;re very pretty, and anyone would be happy to be kissed by you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery blushed but smiled.  &quot;You&#39;re just saying that.&quot;  Sure, she believed Jo, but...<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all.  See, that dumb guy was right about one thing. I am a lesbian.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery looked up at her.  &quot;Really?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, really.  Now, we should do something about your dress, it&#39;s a bit big on you.&quot;  Jo couldn&#39;t actually see the dress, but it wasn&#39;t exactly a wild guess.  &quot;I wish all of Avery&#39;s clothes fit her perfectly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery giggled as her unseen clothing adjusted itself.  She jumped up and posed for Jo, twirling around.  &quot;Am I pretty, Jo?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jo&#39;s eyes got huge as she got quite a show.  She was going to have to wish Avery&#39;s clothes to be visible again, or she&#39;d get a nosebleed or something!  &quot;...you&#39;re the prettiest girl I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery laughed.  &quot;That&#39;s not true, that boy you changed is prettier than me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not by much!  Plus..he was ugly on the inside.  And you...you&#39;re beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery sat down and hugged Jo tightly.  &quot;I love you, Jo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jo blinked.  &quot;R..really?&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery looked into her eyes.  &quot;I do!  You&#39;ve given me something so wonderful...I wish I could do something for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;I...uh...do you want a girlfriend?&quot;  Jo stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you don&#39;t..?  Oh Jo, yes, I&#39;d love to be your girlfriend!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, what if...you know, you want to go back to being a boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery grinned.  &quot;You&#39;ve made me so happy, Jo, I don&#39;t care- I&#39;ll be a girl for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welll...&quot;  Jo smiled.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind experimenting from time to time.  Even as a guy, I thought you were hot as hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery kissed her then, and Jo reciprocated.  Then when she finally pulled away, she smiled softly.  &quot;I&#39;ll do anything you want.  No matter how twisted or perverted.  I&#39;ll be yours forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, you&#39;d be comfortable with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery chewed her lip.  &quot;Uh...mostly?  Wait, how many wishes do you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh as many as I want, I think.&quot;  Jo shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;So if I asked you for something, it wouldn&#39;t be a waste of your wishes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, what do you want, Avery?&quot;<br />
<br />
The other girl&#39;s eyes seemed to sparkle.  &quot;Wish for me to be a perverted girl for you, Joella.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jo huffed.  &quot;Call me Joe.  Ok!  I wish that Avery was just as perverted as I was!  And...I wish couldn&#39;t see her clothing!&quot;  Jo wanted to pat herself on the back for that last one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jo, you silly!  I&#39;d take my clothes off for you whenever you wanted, you didn&#39;t have to wish for that!&quot;  Avery posed.  &quot;But do you like what you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much...ok, I wish I could see your clothes again.&quot;  Jo grinned.  &quot;And then...I wish that you could be naked whenever you wanted, and nobody would freak out about it, and you wouldn&#39;t get in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery shivered a bit.  &quot;Does that mean you want me to take my clothes off, Jo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you be cold?  It&#39;s a little windy today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wish me to not be cold, then?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you&#39;re a genius, Ave.  I wish that Ave would never feel cold or uncomfortable even when she&#39;s completely naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery shivered again, as something changed about her that wasn&#39;t visible.  She then removed her dress and panties (she didn&#39;t have a bra, since up until twenty minutes ago, she&#39;d lacked breasts.  Now she probably could use one, as her breasts were quite bouncy, but she was still young enough that they didn&#39;t sag in the slightest.  In fact, she cupped her breasts, caressing them softly.  &quot;Oh that feels good...so this is what having breasts is like?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I want to touch them...maybe later though.&quot;  Jo picked up Avery&#39;s clothes for her, since she was now clad only in her socks and shoes.  She then slid an arm around Avery&#39;s waist.  &quot;So...your place or mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery blushed.  Despite now being a very perverted girl, her mannerisms hadn&#39;t changed, so she still acted like a shy and gentle girl.  &quot;I had to take a cab to get here, I live uptown with my aunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what, I want to see your place.  Besides, my room is a mess.  It looks like a guy&#39;s room, honestly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery laughed.  &quot;And my room looks like a girl&#39;s...aren&#39;t we a pair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes we are.  But you are a girl, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.  That&#39;s true, but everyone will still think I&#39;m the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could change that?&quot;  Jo suggested.<br />
<br />
Avery frowned.  &quot;No...my life would be very different if I&#39;d been born a girl, I think.  Besides, I wouldn&#39;t have met you if I had, now would I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess not!  Ok, I wish a cab was here to pick us up!&quot;<br />
<br />
As she finished her statement, a cab pulled up.  Jo opened the door.  &quot;After you, my lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery giggled softly and got in, the vinyl of the seats feeling strange beneath her bare ass, and Jo got in with her.  She looked to the driver, who looked to be Middle Eastern.  &quot;I wish you were a hot girl and have always been one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Jo and Avery&#39;s eyes, the man transformed, his features becoming soft and delicate, and his body becoming more slender.  Her clothing was now more feminine, and she looked quite sexy.  &quot;Where to, ladies?&quot;  The woman&#39;s voice was a sexy purr.  She looked to be all of 18.<br />
<br />
Avery gave the woman the address, then whispered to Jo, her breath tickling Jo&#39;s ear.  &quot;Are you going to turn everyone into a pretty girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No?  I haven&#39;t decided.  Does it bother you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Avery shook her head.  &quot;I just hope she&#39;s happy with her life now.  I mean, what if she&#39;d been married?  Or had kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jo was stunned, she hadn&#39;t thought of that.  &quot;I wish that if the cab driver had a wife, she would still be happily married.  I wish if the cab driver had kids, she still would, even if that means they are adopted.  I wish that the cab driver and her family were very happy and healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cab driver seemed much happier, and turned on the radio, singing along to a pop song.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew.  Thanks, Ave, I didn&#39;t think about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, Jo.  Now I&#39;m curious about that other boy, do you think she&#39;ll be ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could always find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later.  Right now...I&#39;m still a virgin.  I don&#39;t want to be one anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jo perked up, and she turned to kiss her new girlfriend.  They made out in the back of the cab for the rest of the trip, while the beautiful Middle Eastern cab driver sang along to a K-Pop song.</p>
