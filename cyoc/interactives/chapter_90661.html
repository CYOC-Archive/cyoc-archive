<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie looked at her elderly neighbor who was working on her garden. Grace was an 85 year old widower who lived across the street from Katie and her mom. She was a kindly woman who had watched Katie on occasion. Katie liked her and felt she would enjoy a return to her youth. Katie now thought how to approach the elderly woman. Quickly she remembered Kellie telling Grace that Kellie&#39;s sister Carol would be coming to the house while Kellie was working on her trial. Katie reasoned that by pretending to be Carol she could get Grace by herself and regress her.<br />
<br />
As Katie exited the house she waved to Grace trying to get her attention. Grace slowly looked up and smiled. &quot;Hello dear,&quot; Grace said as she slowly stood up. &quot;You must be Kellie&#39;s sister Carol. Kellie said you would be staying for a while. Unfortunately I think you just missed them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea,&quot; Katie stated. &quot;No ones home. She did mention something about a neighbor but I forget what it was. You wouldn&#39;t happen to know what she could of meant do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace shook her head. &quot;No dear I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said. &quot;Not sure what she could of been talking about. If you like though we could have a cup of coffee. I&#39;m just finishing up here and it&#39;s always nice to have company over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled. &quot;That sounds great,&quot; Katie said enthusiastically. &quot;I could use a cup. Plus it&#39;s nice to get to know the neighbors especially if I&#39;m going to be in town for awhile.&quot; Grace smiled warmly as she invited Katie inside. Inwardly Katie couldn&#39;t believe her luck, Grace was usually pretty cautious about strangers. Katie thought it could have something to do with the magic of the ring.<br />
<br />
As she entered Graces home she looked over the pictures and antiques spread throughout the house. She noted the old pictures of Grace in her youth and marveled at her beauty. &quot;Can&#39;t wait to see what she looked like in person,&quot; she thought. The two women now made their way into the kitchen. Katie took a seat at the kitchen table while Grace brewed a pot of coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how long will you be staying your sister,&quot; Grace asked. &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Katie answered. &quot;The trial starts today and it could last anywhere from a week to a month. It will be nice to see my niece though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace chuckled softly. &quot;Ah yes Katie,&quot; she said. &quot;Such a precious little girl, so full of energy. I&#39;ve watched her a few times and always enjoyed the experience.&quot; Grace sighed softly. &quot;What is it?&quot; Katie asked. Grace shook her head. &quot;Oh nothing dear,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s just being around such a wonderful child you tend to think fondly of your own youth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled. &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; She asked. &quot;Oh it&#39;s a silly thought,&quot; Grace said dismissively. &quot;The wishes of an old woman but...I do wish sometimes I could relive of youth. You take it for granted when your young. It&#39;s silly though, we can&#39;t turn back the hands of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you could,&quot; Katie asked. What if you could be young again, would you want to?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace gave Katie a puzzled look. &quot;I guess,&quot; she said. Katie smiled. &quot;If you wish for it it might come true.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace continued to look at Katie with a confused look before finally chuckling softly. &quot;Fine,&quot; she said with a laugh. &quot;I wish I was young again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and wished for Grace to be seven again. &quot;Okay done,&quot; Katie said. &quot;I hope you enjoy your youth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace looked at Katie before shaking her head and laughing. &quot;You are on odd one dear,&quot; she said. &quot;But I suppose that&#39;s a good thing. It&#39;s once to meet a young woman with a certain amount quirkiness. It&#39;s actually quite charming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and began watching Grace intently. It was difficult to ascertain if Grace was beginning to regress. The old woman had deep lines in her face and gray hair tied in a bun. After a few moments  Katie could see that the lines in her face seemed less pronounced and black strands were beginning to appear in her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grace,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Perhaps you should go look in the mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know my name?&quot; She asked. &quot;Did Kellie tell you about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me,&quot; Katie said. &quot;I think you are going to like what you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly Grace got up and made her way to the downstairs bathroom. Grace was surprised the the pain in her knees and back seemed to have vanished. As she looked into the mirror her jaw went slack. &quot;Oh my...&quot; She whispered. &quot;I&#39;m.....I&#39;m getting younger.&quot; Grace stared in shock at the sixty year old woman in front of her. In only a matter of moments she had become 25 years younger. The grey in her hair was rapidly disappearing replaced by the lovely raven locks of her youth. As Grace became fifty most of the grey had vanished from her hair and most of the wrinkles on her face had disappeared. &quot;How....how are you doing this?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic,&quot; Katie answered happily. &quot;You seem to have a desire to relive your youth so I felt it would be a nice gift to give you. Don&#39;t worry though it&#39;s not permanent I can change you back whenever you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace looked  at her 45 year old self in astonishment. &quot;Why would I want to go back,&quot; she said. &quot;Look at me I&#39;m so young, and I think I&#39;m still getting younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace ran her hands through her raven locks, which now flowed past her shoulders. Running her hands over her body she smiled as the grey disappeared and only a few lines remained around her eyes. &quot;Look at me,&quot; she said as she grasped her d cup breasts. &quot;I look 35...no wait maybe 33. This is incredible, I feel so young and full of energy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as Grace left her thirties and became 29. The two women were now the same age and Katie marveled at her beauty. Grace had flawless alabaster skin with sultry green eyes and long flowing raven hair. Grace turned to Katie with a look of pure joy. &quot;I feel amazing,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;m so young look at me, 29 again. I have my whole life in front me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace looked at herself in the mirror and paused. Grace didn&#39;t look 29 anymore, she looked closer to 25 or 24. The maturity of a woman near 30 was quickly becoming the look of a girl fresh out of college.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; she said as she became 23. &quot;I&#39;m really looking young now. I look like a child, barely in my twenties. I...I can&#39;t be more than 21 now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace ran her hands over her body. The weight she had put on had vanished leaving her with a lean figure. Graces breasts were still large but had lost the fullness of her twenties. Grace now looked like a beautiful young college co-ed. &quot;Um how old am I going to become?&quot; Grace asked as she became 20. &quot;Well I figure I would let you relive your childhood.&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
Grace stared in the mirror as she reentered her teens. &quot;Childhood,&quot; she whispered. Grace looked herself over. The blouse she wore was loose around her midsection but was pushed out by her large breasts. Her pants were now very loose around her waist forcing her to hold them up on her narrow waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m..I&#39;m going to be a child?!&quot; She exclaimed as she became 18. &quot;I think I&#39;m already a child. Look at me I look like a high school student.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace continued to gaze at her reflection as she became 17 and then 16.  Grace was now beginning to shrink as puberty began to reverse itself. Grace looked at her youthful hands as the cuffs of her blouse began to creep over her wrists. Graces eyes glowed with youthful energy as she became a young teen of 15. &quot;Wow,&quot; she gasped. &quot;I look barely old enough to be in high school now.&quot; Turning to Katie she now found herself having to look up at the now older woman. &quot;I can&#39;t believe how young I am and...and I&#39;m still getting younger. I can feel it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace was now trying to adjust her increasing baggy clothes. Kicking her shoes away Grace now stood in sock covered feet while the cuffs of her pants began to pool around her feet. &quot;I&#39;m getting so small,&quot; she exclaimed as she grasped her shrinking breasts with her free hand. &quot;I&#39;m barely a teenager now, my voice, my body I look and sound like a kid now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope your not mad,&quot; Katie said. &quot;I just wanted to give you a chance to relive your youth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace looked up at Katie as she becam 12. &quot;Surprisingly I&#39;m not mad,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m amazed how young I am but I&#39;m okay with this. Just out of curiosity how young am I going to become?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seven,&quot; Katie answered sheepishly. Graces eyes flew open as she became 11. She was about to say something but paused. Sighing the young girl shrugged and looked over her youthful form, which was now devoid of the assets of puberty. Smiling the young girl let her overly large pants cascade to the floor. The ten year old girl stepped out of her pants and now stood barefoot in the kitchen. Her overly large blouse now covered her down to her theigh maintaining her modesty. Grace smiled happily as she descended into the single digits of her life. Katie watched happily as Grace shrank down becoming eight and finally seven.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; Katie asked. The small girl looked up at Katie. The blouse she wore covered her to her knees while the sleeves went several inches past her hands. &quot;I feel amazing,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;So what should we do now?&quot;</p>
