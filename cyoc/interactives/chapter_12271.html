<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was perfectly willing to physically become any of the others.  But as the electric wave passed through him and he started to slim but not get any shorter, he knew that he was getting his first choice, Tony.  His waist and hips slimmed and it seemed that his legs became a bit longer.  He watched his fingers and feet stretch as well then felt the very shape of his skull altering, cheekbones becoming more prominent and jaw becoming stronger.  And though his pelvis had narrowed, Jeff felt his shoulders widen.  Then his skin changed.  Every mole, every freckle, every blemish and imperfection faded away leaving flawless soft skin.  Visible body hair other than his bush disappeared except for some very fine hair on his calves and forearms.  His circumcised penis suddenly grew a droopy foreskin much bigger than necessary, but only at first.  Moments later Jeff saw his penis thicken and then stretch to what he knew from gym class to be Tony's size.  He felt that flawless skin of his tighten and almost seem to squeeze the fat out of him and finally added some additional muscle as his shoulders and especially his buns muscled up.<br />
<br />
Not that he needed confirmation that he now had Tony's body, but JeffasTony glanced around and saw who had changed into whom.  Everyone was pretty satisfied except for Eric who had now become JeffasTony's little bro.  But Jeff cut Eric's whining short.  The three who were no longer outwardly St. Martins left and Jeff hid the chronivac.  <br />
<br />
While EricasMark went to look at the new body he'd just badmouthed so strongly, JeffasTony lay down on Tony's bed, picked up a book and started reading.  He got one page into a biography of Tesla before realizing what he was doing and laughing.  Just five minutes into Tony's body and he was behaving like Tony.  JeffasTony wondered how much of Tony's behavior was wired into him by his body's chemistry, the introverted temperment and intellectual interests, all of it.  <br />
<br />
He started delving into Tony's memory.  Somehow, in Tony's body and possessing all of Tony's memories, the intellectual things that fascinated Tony interested him as well.  He was tremendously impressed by all the things that Tony knew and was several minutes into just what Tony knew about World War II when he heard his mother, downstairs, giving EricasMark a serious spanking.  He had heard Tony vaguely talk about his parents in negative ways but called on Tony's memories of them now and was shocked at how bitter Tony felt.  He came across memory after memory of indifference or worse toward him and outrageous favortism toward his sister.  A few minutes later, EricasMark came running up to his room complaining.  JeffasTony suggested that Eris use his Mark memory and he'd realize that it wasn't any kind of anomaly.  <br />
<br />
Jeff also realized just how protective Tony felt toward his little brother.  He was a sort of semi-parent to Mark.  Tony requesting that Mark be given the same model/athlete body had been inevitable.  JeffasTony made sure to be at EricasMark's ballet performance the next night, but stayed behind a pole for most of the performance so that Eric didn't feel even more self conscious about being out there in his tights.  But Eric did great in his new reed thin, round assed Mark body.  <br />
<br />
When they got home, though, Mr. and Mrs. St. Martin were absolutely indifferent.  JeffasTony tried to tell them that their youngest son had been brilliant and that everyone was tremendously impressed with him but they just brushed it off with indifference.<br />
<br />
The whole week was like that for Jeff in his Tony St. Martin body.  Outside of the St. Martin house, he was treated with amazing deference and solicitude.  Every female store clerk (and a surprising number of the males) saw him and perked up.  Some completely lost track of what they were doing or how much change was required.  Others bagged things excessively and asked if there was anything else they could do for him, right after having asked if there was anything else they could do for him.  Jeff found that, in Tony's body, he could turn every head in any room.  He also found that there was a certain portion of the men he encountered who reacted with hostility.  He delved into Tony's memory about similar encounters and found that Tony had developed the theory that they were attracted to him and while they wouldn't completely acknowledge that to themselves, they reacted to it with anger, anger which they turned to him.  The issue brought to mind a thought that had mildly worried Jeff.  he searched for Tony's recollections of having had sex with his best friend Jack.  Jeff let out a sigh of relief.  Tony's recollections were also slightly tinged by a feeling of it not having quite been him, but were also very happy.  Tony's memories of fucking Jack were quite pleasant ones.  The same was true of Jeff's memories of screwing Eric and that had slightly worried him.  But as striking as Tony's appearance was, he was completely straight there could be no hiding that with his entire life's memories open to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Teachers in school showed him a regard that *must* have been related to his looks.  Tony had always been a sort of quiet wiseass, a definite thorn in the side of pompous teachers but they let   JeffasTony get away with a ridiculous number of cutting remarks.  All he had to do was flash his model's smile and the teachers melted, disarmed by his looks.<br />
<br />
JeffasTony wondered if that was what had first attracted Tony's girlfriend Claire.  And it may have been part of the attraction, but she was every bit the brainiac that Tony was.  She sent an email a day on some intellectual topic or site, some unusual occurrence or something.  Searching Tony's memory, Jeff could tell that Tony was absolutely head over heels for her.  And why not, she was smoking hot, shoulder length brunette hair, dark green eyes and a slender hourglass shape.  All of it was stored over and over in Tony's memory.  She was so much a part of Tony's stored thoughts that Jeff was reluctant to even see her.  He found no memories of anything but kissing and groping going on between them.  It just wouldn't be fair to have sex with her in Tony's body before Tony got to.  So, JeffasTony ended up engaging in some marathon masturbation sessions while thinking of her.  He laughed at the size of his erect penis.  &quot;She'd better be prepared for this&quot; he chuckled after one time.<br />
<br />
As the week went on, Jeff found himself even more drawn into Tony's intellectual fixations, reading a book on philosophy, finishing the biography of Tesla, playing chess on line.  It wasn't a choice or an escape from playing sports, at which Tony was terrific, but a positive need.  Tony HAD to think about those things.  He couldn't stop.  It amazed JeffasTony that his parents didn't have more appreciation for him.  He was handsome, athletic, and intelligent.  What more did they want?  What was he supposed to do to ever get on the same plateau as their daughter in their eyes?<br />
<br />
When they gathered in his room on Sunday night, Jeff was reluctant to give up Tony's body, as he felt his hips widening, face reshaping and penis shortening, but pleased to understand him a bit better.</p>
