<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake’s alarm clock started ringing. Still drowsy, he slams his palm down on it trying to hit the snooze button. Little did he realize he almost crushed it under his muscle mass. “Whoa! That’s right... forgot about that.” Jake had managed to remember last night that he turned himself and Leo into bodybuilding dogs. He saw Leo in his bed still sleeping through the alarm. His alarm displayed 8:00am. He must’ve been up real late if he’s still out. Jake went over to the mirror to look at his body again. He was still a bulky shiba man. Jake tried flexing out his biceps in the mirror. The feeling satisfied him. His body not only looked good, it felt great. His tail started to wag when he saw the pose he made, putting his arms on the back of his head with his chest out and legs bent. He thought it made him cuter than before. He than turned to Leo sound asleep on his bed. Leo had been sleeping on his back while a hand paw rested on his bulky chest, with the rest of his body basically a spread eagle. Leo also did look kinda cute while he was sleeping.<br />
<br />
After slipping on a new par of boxers, Jake quietly left the bedroom, failing to avoid his tail from hitting the door. “Ouch!” Jake had yelped in pain. He looked back to see Leo still asleep. Sighing in relief, he managed to close the door. It was Saturday and Jake hadn’t had any weekend classes. He was free to do whatever, whichever pleases him. With his new stature, he thought it would be appropriate to find a date. He hadn’t dated anyone since junior high, and wanted to try again after it didn’t work out the last time. He figured the program could change how people thought, so getting a date wouldn’t be too hard. Jake had someone in mind. Laura, another freshman just like him. Laura had already made it clear that she liked Jake, so he thought she would do. Jake pulled his cellphone out of his backpack making a call. Luckily his hands hadn’t change so he could use the touchscreen without a problem. Moments later, Laura was on the phone. “Hello?” Laura said over the phone, yawning a bit. Jake forgot it was early in the morning. “Morning Laura. Sorry, did I wake you up?” Jake asked concerned. “Nah. I’ve been awake for an hour now, just trying to stay awake is all. But anyway, what can I do for ya?” Jake heard the snark in her voice. She probably knew what he was gonna ask. “I’ve been thinking about it, and I think it might be fun if we hang out together for a bit.” Laura chuckled through the phone. “To be clear, this is considered a date right?” Jake hadn’t wanted to make it official, but he was in college. He was open to try new things. “Yeah. It’s a date. Where do you want to meet?” Jake asked. “I was thinking somewhere outside of campus. We could get some breakfast at Bayside Café.” Jake liked the idea. He used to go there for breakfast when he was younger. ”Sounds good. How’s 9:30 sound?” “Perfect. I’ll meet ya over there Fido.” Then she hung up, leaving Jake blushing. She already had a doggy nickname for him.<br />
<br />
Since Jake was aloud to walk around public areas without cloths, people didn’t seem to pay no mind he was only in his boxers. Walking in his bare feet didn’t bother him either, since his paw pads made it easy to walk on hard concrete. Jake being covered in fur also helped the fact it was a fairly breezy morning. He saw the café in his view, with Laura sitting on a bench waiting for him. Laura was wearing a white zip up jacket, and skinny jeans. Her hair was mid-length, with a scarlet red (not really a natural hair color). “Hey Fido. Finally made it.” Jake gave her a sour look. “Okay, that’s enough of that.” Laura laughed. “Aw, don’t like the nickname?” “Lets just get inside. You must be cold without a fur coat.” Jake egged her on. She gave a snarky smile as she followed him inside.<br />
<br />
Bayside Café was always loaded for breakfast. It was the most popular area for it considering the food and atmosphere. The two found a table and began to discuss what they wanted. “Alright. I’ll go ahead and order for us.” Laura said heading to the bar area. Jake thought for a minute about Laura. Should he change her? She seemed sweet enough to accept him like that. But it would probably get more awkward for her having a boyfriend completely different in a different species (never mind looking like a bodybuilder). Who knows, maybe Jake will like the changes. Jake pulled his laptop from his bag and vegan typing. For Laura’s breed, he decided to make her a border collie. Jake could already think about snuggling that thick fur with his own. Jake also set the muscle slider to 70%. He wondered if because of females shorter frame, she wouldn’t get as big. Jake didn’t really care though, just as long as she was big and bulky like him. He also adjusted her undergarments so they would adjust to her new build. With one last look at her human form, Jake clicked change.<br />
<br />
Laura was still talking to the waitress at the bar. Jake looked over at her to see if it was happening. Jake noticed Laura’s feet were getting cramped in her shoes. She took them off before the started stretching. Laura found herself standing on her toes withe her stretching feet. Jake noticed black pads growing when she lifted one foot, holding onto the bar for support. Her legs started gaining mass as well, becoming more defined. Her toes started stretching out into claws as brown fur started climbing up her ankle. The sprouting fur turned white while traveling through her skinny jeans, making them bulky. Laura’s jeans were getting to tight for her to handle, as the started ripping, showing more white fur spreading up her legs. The white fur continued to spread up to her waist. With all the muscle she got, Jake was surprised her jeans were still partly intact. Jake was still watching as her butt was growing thicker, making his eyes widen. Above it, was a bump all too familiar to Jake. The new bump stretched out to three feet, growing the same lush white fur as her legs with brown at the tip. She was finally done with the waiter as she walked back with her new tail wagging behind.<br />
<br />
“Kay. They should be out in a bit.” Laura told Jake, placing a tag labeled 28 on the table. “Ugh... hold on, it’s getting hot in here.” She told Jake as she took off her jacket. Jake saw that Laura’s belly had grown the same white fur from her legs. Her gut was also expanding an 8 pack. Her chest started growing as well, making her breasts blossom, into two giant beach all sizes. More fur crawled to her chest, and started spreading to her forearms. As the fur sprouted, her muscles started expanding outward, leaving her flexing as if it were the natural thing to do. The fur finally spread to her hands, turning her nails into black claws, and growing pads on her palms. Her chest growth finally mad for her shirt to burst in tatters. “Ah, much better. Glad that’s not my favorite shirt.” Her mind thought this was all normal. She thought her turning into a doggy she hulk was natural for her.<br />
<br />
Her neck started thickening slowly until it was almost unnoticeable. The fur spread to her face, as it pushed her mouth out, her nose followed becoming wet and black. The fur reached her new muzzle, throwing thick fur as if it were som sort of beard. The fur traveled until it stopped at her hair, reaching out to her ears. Her ears grew, becoming triangular and flopping downward, growing brown fur with a white tip. “Anyway, what did you want to talk about?”<br />
<br />
Jake didn’t answer her question. Instead he focused on Laura’s new look. Her muscles were pulsating. They were basically as big as Jakes. Except her chest size was somewhat bigger for obvious reasons. At least her bra still covered that part. Jake saw the transformation twice already of course, but on a female, it was a bit different... “Jake?” Jake snapped back to Laura’s canine face. “Oh, sorry. Just haven’t done this since junior high. I’m just kinda nervous.” He wasn’t lying though. Jake was in the presence of another dog person, but was still daunted by the experience of dating. Laura’s tail started to wag and she reached her hand paw to Jakes. “I get you. To be honest, this is my first date in a while as well. Don’t worry too much. We’re not committing to anything yet ya know.” Jake kind of doubted that, looking at her in that state. Regardless, she was right. He should just try to relax and enjoy his time with his canine woman. Jakes smiled, with his own tail starting to wag. “There ya go. Thats the spirit.” Laura told him smiling with her new muzzle.<br />
<br />
They kept talking, waiting patently for their food...</p>
