<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On Bernard&#39;s mind was Mr. Hawthorne, the hunkiest, most sexy man he&#39;d ever laid eyes on. Hawthorne was always so confident and assertive, plus he was hot as hell. If only he could feel that power and composure just once... <br />
Bernard suddenly jolted upright as an intense sensation suddenly bored into him. It was like nothing the skinny 130 lb nerd had ever felt before. It was invigoratingly powerful. He was wasted in time and lost in a sea of sensation. <br />
Suddenly, a searing pain in his hands caught him out of his glaze. Bernard looked down at his hands to see them growing and becoming thicker. They were becoming the kind of hands that were trained through sports and had remained strong throughout years upon years of training. They certainly looked out of place on his changing body.<br />
Next Bernard turned his attention towards his feet. He squirmed as he could feel them changing too. They ripped through his crummy Nike shoes, exposing massive feet which had been well adapted to running. But then his feet were suddenly swallowed by a pair of white dress socks then followed by a size 14 brown pair of men&#39;s loafers. <br />
Bernard was perplexed. He tried hard to focus on who he was becoming, but it was becoming increasingly more difficult to focus.<br />
Bernard jolted as the sensation spread up his legs. And in an instant, his skeletal legs beefed out to reveal massive quads and ripped legs. After all, Brandon never skipped leg day. Wait, what? Who was Brandon? Why had he just thought that? <br />
Bernard&#39;s thoughts were interrupted as he felt his flimsy athletic shorts begin to vibrate. His small red shorts began to radically transform into an astute black fabric. They were becoming mens dress pants! Bernard watched with delight as these new pants flowed delicately down and perfectly wrapped around his strapping legs. Bernard then felt the tingling sensation spread to his extremities. He first felt his tidey whities ride up hid only turn to a silky pair of grey boxerjocks seconds later. He then watched in wonder as his small butt expanded out to occupy the dress pants. On the other side, he felt his crotch jittering and growing. His teenage dick grew out to an adult&#39;s length, creating a husky bulge in his pants. A fine leather belt coiled lovingly around his waist, tightening the pants around his lower body. <br />
He then felt his upper body begin to change. Drowning in ecstasy, Bernard watched as his shrimpy upper body became filled with testosterone. His nonexistent abs bulked out into sexy washboard ones. His chest followed suit and bulked out, giving way to massive pecs. Veins protruded from his frail arms as they grew, gaining mass he could&#39;ve never imagined having. Bernard&#39;s back had become jacked as well, occupied by thick muscles beneath his skin. By now his black graphic design t shirt was in shreds, and in its place a white fabric materialized over his mighty upper body. A suave dress shirt demurely concealed Bernard&#39;s strapping chest and broad shoulders. While tucking securely into his pants, the shirt gained a collar and a black tie unfolded out of it, gently tightening itself around his muscular neck and huge, broad shoulders.<br />
With only his teenage face left, Bernard braced himself as what felt like thousands of prickles pierce his cheeks. Eradicating his zits and pimples, the hair extended out to a small yet suave look, giving him scruff. Bernard&#39;s lips puffed out, his chin and jawline broadened, and his eyes turned from pale hazel to a deep sapphire blue. He then felt his thick-rimmed glasses disappear as his eyesight adjusted to superior vision. Likewise, his braces seemed to disappear from his crooked teeth and they instantly straightened out to perfect white teeth. His nasally, pubescent voice deepened to a confident, manly one. Numb as hell, Bernard touched his greasy blonde hair as he felt it changing. His unkempt, dirty hair blackened and became saturated with gel, altering itself into a short, slicked up crew cut. <br />
Finally, Bernard saw a nametag form over his massive left pec. It read: Mr. Hawthorne. Of course, Brandon Hawthorne thought, I am a teacher here after all. And Bernard felt a surge of memories inundate his mind. He had been teaching history at this high school for a couple years now. Having wrestled when he was in high school, he was now the head wrestling coach. And he lived with his beautiful wife and baby. He was not nor would he ever want to be gay, he was completely straight, and a humble husband to his compassionate wife. He was Mr. Hawthorne. <br />
Awakening from his daydream, Mr. Hawthorne looked around only to see desks filled with students, all intently listening to him teach and taking notes. Of course he was teaching, he had taught this course for a couple years now. But he was talking and he fully comprehended what he was saying. In the back of his mind, Brandon Hawthorne remembered Bernard but he was truly a new man, and he embraced his new life with gratitude.</p>
