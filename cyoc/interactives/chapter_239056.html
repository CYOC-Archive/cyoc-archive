<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The die had landed on a five.<br />
Jennifer stood upright from the desk, her head shaking back and forth. &quot;Well, there you go, Kyle. I&#39;m playing your game. And looking stupid while doing it, too.&quot; She sauntered over to her bed again, lying down across it. She grabbed out her phone and took to her usual act of scrolling her TikTok. The feeds she found bored her, and several just seemed to keep her mood sour. Kyle had twisted her morning into a messy knot with his ranting. She could still not believe his words. There was no curse. He was just delusional and lost. Nothing that Jennifer could help with. He reminded her of her own Uncle Fitz, who was regularly told to seek a psychiatrist for his belief that all women were mind-controlled by the government to steal his money. He acted so calmly despite the obvious open ends in his logic. Kyle had been the same on the call, behaving like what he said was serious and true. Like a fact, not fiction. Jennifer again shook her head.<br />
&quot;Freaking lunatic. Hope no one else has to hear that B.S.&quot; She typed a supportive comment for a post about home decor before continuing scrolling further. She briefly checked the time. She had a couple of minutes before she had to get ready for school. She could already hear her sister thumping her way down the hallway to the bathroom. There was a faint clanking from the kitchen, which Jen assumed was her mother making breakfast. It was another morning progressing as normal.<br />
That was until Jen started to feel something. It started with her chest. Like a slight heat was being applied to her torso. Jen tried to ignore it, but whatever it was was bugging her. Frustrated with the sudden irritation, Jen sat up and looked down at her chest. She was startled to find that her once loose night shirt looked full. The material was stretched out now. Curious about the development, she leaned forward and pulled off her top to expose her torso.<br />
She was greeted with two breasts, her own. Except these seemed engorged like they had grown a little. Not much, maybe a cup or two, but enough to be noticed by her. Her nipples were small hills on her skin, erected from the cold air of her room. They seemed to have also grown slightly, but not as much as the breasts they sat on.<br />
Jennifer was astounded. Without another thought, she leapt up and scrambled for her underwear drawer. She pulled out her favourite bra, a white floral-patterned strapped bra measuring 36C. She pulled up the straps and tried to hook the clasp. She found more resistance than usual, and when she finally pulled them together, she was left staring at boobs that spilled over the cups of the bra. They had grown.<br />
&quot;Well. You&#39;re kidding me. I... They grew. They actually grew. How on Earth did they-&quot; Jennifer paused when she noticed the die, still sitting where it had been on her desk edge. &quot;No way.&quot; She moved to her desk with her bra constricting her. <br />
The die was still on the five, which, according to Kyle, was a low number for transforming. &quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me. The die did this?&quot; she asked the empty room. She picked it up, turning it in her hand. It was an ordinary twenty-sided die, one her sister had forgotten about. It went from 1 to 20 and was a solid pearl white with black numbering. Nothing special at all about it. &quot;I don&#39;t believe it. I could just be hallucinating.&quot;<br />
It was at that moment she heard her mother from downstairs. &quot;Hey, girls! Let&#39;s get moving, the pancakes will be cold!&quot;<br />
Across the hall, the bathroom door opened, and Jen&#39;s sister Abby leaned out. &quot;&#39;Kay, mom. Be right there.&quot; She leaned back in and closed the door again.<br />
Jennifer did not respond but knew she ought to get downstairs quickly. She opted for her larger clothing, hoping her bra was okay with being a bit more cramped with flesh than previous. She grabbed her bag, throwing all the items from her desk into the pockets. She grabbed the die again, looking it over before depositing it into her coat pocket. <br />
She hurried downstairs, feeling more movement than usual, and arrived at the dining table. There was a plate of pancakes already placed in her spot with cutlery laid out. Her mom was turned to the stove, facing the other way. Jennifer took a seat, and not long after, Abby joined her at the table. Immediately Abby felt something was off about her sister.<br />
&quot;Uh, morning, Jen.&quot; Her face was scrunched a little like she did not see the image in front of her right.<br />
&quot;Morning. What&#39;s... what&#39;s that face for?&quot; asked Jen.<br />
&quot;Um, nothing, sorry.&quot; Jen was a bit weirded out at that answer. Usually, Abby and Jen quipped at each other in the morning like ordinary siblings. Jen&#39;s boobs seem to have suddenly changed that. &quot;Mom, can I have some butter for my pancakes?&quot;<br />
&quot;Right here, sweet.&quot; Their mom set the dish next to her, giving her a slight smile. &quot;So, what is happening today? I need to know because I will be out from three into the evening. &quot;<br />
Jennifer and Abby looked at each other with mischievous grins. They already knew, as their mother was very bad at keeping her dating life a secret. &quot;What&#39;s his name?&quot; asked Jen.<br />
&quot;HER name is &#39;NoneOfYourBusiness.&#39;&quot;<br />
Jen just about choked on her food. &quot;Oh my god, really? Mom. Holy shit.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; snapped her mother, &quot;Language! Yes, her. I&#39;m... tired of trying to impress men. They want someone who fits their dreams rather than their reality. And they often want to screw around rather than be a part of our lives. Do you know how long I&#39;ve been looking for someone to take love and marriage seriously?&quot; She picked up her plate, moving to the kitchen counter. &quot;I found her via Facebook about two weeks ago, and we&#39;ve been messaging. We have similar interests, and we live within twenty minutes of each other. She is interested in a relationship, and so am I. So, promise me you will not, and I repeat, NOT object because I am sick and tired of looking for someone with all these dumb men prancing around.&quot;<br />
Both girls were silent. Jennifer&#39;s day was getting very confusing, but understandably so. First, the call, then her breasts, and now her mother coming out of the closet. This was getting increasingly weirder. But it was thankfully something she could respect. Their mother had been desperate to find love again after her husband and their father had passed away from kidney failure. It is not something they should have had to experience, but it happened. Their mom had become supermom in his absence, doing what she could to stay on top and in charge. She worked a job for a marketing firm and often volunteered at shelters for animals, so her life was one continuous working day. They had no idea how she could survive so well without him.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have dropped that on you this morning,&quot; their mom said.<br />
&quot;Mom. It&#39;s cool. I respect it,&quot; Jen responded assuringly, &quot;and it may be good for you to figure it out. I say do it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, you go, Mom!&quot; Abby blurted out with a pancake in her mouth.<br />
&quot;Thanks, girls. Now, again, anyone doing anything today?&quot;<br />
Both girls shook their heads, but Abby had a second thought. &quot;Oh wait! I was gonna stay at Leia&#39;s house. Can I still stay overnight?&quot;<br />
Their mother sighed, &quot;Sure, you can. Nothing from you, Jen?&quot; She got a head shake in response. &quot;Okay, then you are housesitting. I may or may not be back tonight, so make sure to lock up in case I&#39;m not.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay Mom,&quot; said Jennifer.<br />
&quot;Good. Now, to the bus, it&#39;s already ten to,&quot; their mom ushered them off.<br />
Both girls hurried to finish their meal before gathering up their school supplies and leaving the house. Their mother watched as the bus pulled away, shedding a tear of joy that her daughters had accepted her sudden change in dating.</p>
