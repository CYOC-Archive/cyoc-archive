<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max decided to mess with the twins even more, but before that he wanted to have an easier time changing them, so he typed another question in the machine.<br />
<br />
WHAT IF A WOMAN COULDN&#39;T WAKE UP WHENEVER I DON&#39;T WANT THEM TO?<br />
<br />
With that simple solution, he was in for an easy time and a long, transformative night.<br />
<br />
Slowly making his way to the twin&#39;s room on tip-toes, Max right beside Holly laying on the bed. Usually she wasn&#39;t a back sleeper, but her new body worked a bit different than before. Not wasting any time, he began by whistling in an ascending tone, watching her grow a few inches each time he did it. Last night, her feet stuck out of the bedsheet, but tonight her knees were on one level with the edge od the bed, forcing her feet to rest on the ground.<br />
<br />
Satisfied, Max continued by blowing raspberries into her ear. Conveniently, she had one arm resting off to the side. With every second, he could see her toned arms grow in size. After some time they eclipsed her previous size even when they were flexed. But these arms were just resting without a single impulse to make them grow bigger.<br />
<br />
He also noticed her hips rising slightly, which must be the muscles in her butt growing bigger and harder. To further help it out, he clapped his hands a few times, watching her lower torso slowly rise up higher and higher. By the end it almost looked like she wasperforming a hip bridge, constantly, of course.<br />
<br />
To finish off the changes, he snapped his fingers. First his left hand, then the right hand. Holly&#39;s boobs were rapidly increasing in size, making her previously honeymelon-sized boobs look underdeveloped.<br />
<br />
As he inspected her one more time, his gazed switched to Molly. At first, he didn&#39;t have changing her in mind. However, now that he saw her laying sideways in a position that radiated uncomfortability, he had to change her some more.<br />
<br />
Just like with Holly, Max whistled some tones, but this time in descending order. Her already quite short body shrunk again and again, making her previous height look like it could bully her current. He decided against making her fatter, especially since she somehow looked even heavier than before.<br />
<br />
Leaving their room, he thought about adding some more questions, but ultimately decided against it since there was always another day... or night, in this case.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The next morning, Holly was up earlier than Molly once again. Only this time, as she was heading for the bathroom,she bumped her head against the doorframe. After rubbing her forehead, she realized what this must have meant and raced to the bathroom. Max waited for her like yesterday, but this time Holly was way too excited and slammed the door shut in a way that shook the entire floor.<br />
<br />
Inside, Holly expected to see her face in the mirror, but was only able to see her now watermelon-sized boobs. She ducked, bringing her unchanged face in full view. It felt so out of place on her 7&#39;10&quot; tall body, but maybe that was just because of how she looked like before all that.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, she lightly squeezed one of her breasts, which almost caused her moan out loud. As she did so, her eyes were about to fall out of their sockets as she noticed the obvious bulge on her arm. Instinctively, she flexed her arm and saw the already impressive bulge burst out into a mountain of hard muscle, reaching almost halfway up her forearm. She poked it with her other hand, but it wouldn&#39;t give in the slightest.<br />
<br />
She pushed her wall of boobs aside to be greeted by six incredibly defined abs, with number seven and eight already on their way to the surface. Even slight obliques were visible from the right angle. She took a step back and saw her thighs, one of them as large as her cinched, but cobbled waist. They looked uniquely soft with visible, delicate angles, but as soon as she flexed one of them, all that soft looking fat made room for a massively huge, muscular thigh. Her calves weren&#39;t that far behind either, but still looked small compared to the rest of her legs.<br />
<br />
Now there was only one thing left to check, and for that she turned sideways. Her butt stood out by more than a foot, giving her a literal assshelf. She wiggled her hips a bit, but her butt didn&#39;t seem to move at all. It looked very smooth, but she could easily feel the steel spheres underneath that soft layer of fat.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Molly was up and standing in front of the bathroom, ready to enter it.<br />
<br />
As she did, all she could see was a massive crotch, as well as thighs that were as thick as she was. Looking up, huge mountains of boobs covered most of her sister&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Holly...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey there, sis.&quot; She answered, almost feeling embarrassed with how much bigger she was.<br />
<br />
Molly looked to the side, and noticed she couldn&#39;t see anything of her body below eye-level. She knew she must&#39;ve shrunk again, now being just 4 feet tall with all of the fat remaining on her body. She practically pissed herself seeing her only indentical sister turn from normal to amazonian sex-goddess. All the while she was getting tinier, fatter and most notably to herself, far more insecure. Just standing beside that gargantuan thigh made her experience a bit of fear, not because her sister would seek to hurt her, but that she does so accidentally.<br />
<br />
In one bitter-sweet moment, all of Molly&#39;s fear, insecurity and anger left only one outcome.<br />
<br />
&quot;This. Isn&#39;t. FAIR. Why do you of all people get to be so big. And. Not. ME?&quot; She raged at her sister, throwing a well-placed punch right in the middle of her thigh.<br />
<br />
As much as this outburst of rage helped to release some anger, she soon regretted said outburst. Suddenly, her entire hand began to hurt. That was to be expected since she was punching the equivalent of a brick wall, but given her tiny and weak built it was closer to a steel beam.<br />
<br />
&quot;OUCH!&quot; Molly shouted in pain, while Holly didn&#39;t really get what was wrong with her as she barely even noticed something hitting her leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck ALL of this. Fuck the universe. Fuck you!&quot; she insulted her twin sister and left the bathroom, a mix of tears and hatred fueled her exit.<br />
<br />
Holly was surprised by her sudden outburst, but didn&#39;t have a grudge on her just because of that. She could understand her pain, well, at least emotionally. But at the same time, she looked back at her mountain of bicep and couldn&#39;t deny that she was enjoying being the obviously bigger sister. Being either well-endowed, athletic or tall was one thing, but being all of that squared tingled something deep within her. Not an evil side, but more like a hidden away interest.<br />
<br />
Max had the pleasure to watch their conversation after Molly entered the bathroom and thought about what to do next. He could change them even more... or maybe he should just let things play out for now.</p>
