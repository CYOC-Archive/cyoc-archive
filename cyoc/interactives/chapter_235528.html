<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wonder how this happened?&quot; the clone said, glancing at his hands and feeling his body. &quot;Last thing I remember was lying on the floor. And I didn&#39;t feel quite right, like I was sort of numb or something.&quot;   The clone looked over at Jeff, and tilted its head. &quot;What the hell happened?&quot; it asked. &quot;And who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed. &quot;I&#39;m...Jeff, actually. And I created you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clone&#39;s eyes opened wide. &quot;Really? How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...yeah, I used this machine to turn you into a human.&quot; Jeff motioned to it over on his desk. &quot;You&#39;re the exact same as me. In every way. <br />
 Basically you&#39;re my clone, or twin, whichever you prefer.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clone looked down at his naked body. &quot;Weird. I look like you. But how can I exist? I didn&#39;t before, right? This is kinda freaky, man. Are you sure we&#39;re the same person?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugged. &quot;You tell me.&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&#39;t have anything better to do today, so I decided to try out this program that lets me change one thing into something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is...pretty cool.&quot; the clone said, smiling. &quot;Thanks, dude.&quot;  The clone touched his body all over, seeing what it felt like to be alive.  &quot;Uh, Jeff?  What is this crusty stuff on my skin and,&quot; he ran a hand over his head, &quot;er, and hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that.&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a mix of, um, my sweat, and uh, cum.&quot;  Jeff&#39;s face flushed red.  &quot;You were my, uh, jack-off sock for years.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clone&#39;s smile turned to a grimace, and he tried wiping his hands off. &quot;Ugh, that&#39;s disgusting! Ew, I can smell it now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you didn&#39;t mind being used when you were just a sock.&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Anyway, that&#39;s not really important. The important part is, now you&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m covered in your old cum.  Eww.&quot; The clone wiping his hands on his legs. &quot;Didn&#39;t you ever bother washing me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff scratched his chin. &quot;Yeah, sorry.&quot; he said. &quot;I probably should have at least before I created you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s for sure.&quot; the clone said, still wiping his hands and feeling his head. &quot;Damn, you left lot of dried-up jizz on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed.  This wasn&#39;t quite the conversation he&#39;d expected having when he turned his old jack-off sock into a copy of himself.  &quot;Look, why don&#39;t I help you get cleaned up. Sound good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than good.&quot; the clone said, standing. &quot;So, lead on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, I&#39;ll take you to the shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, cool.&quot; the clone said. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had a shower before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled his eyes at the obvious sarcasm.  So, yeah, it has probably been forever since he washed the sock, and yes he jacked off into it at least once a day for who knows how long, but...he thought about it and that was kind of gross, even before he turned the sock into his clone. He probably did owed the guy a good cleaning, after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fine.&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll clean you off.&quot;  Jeff led the clone to the shower and showed him how to turn it on and use the shampoo to wash the cum out of his hair.  He stood outside the shower and grabbed a bottle of body wash. Squeezing some into his hand, he lathered it up and rubbed it onto the clone&#39;s back. His copy flinched slightly at the touch, but then relaxed and leaned back into Jeff&#39;s touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;This feels pretty nice.&quot; he said, enjoying the sensations of another person&#39;s hands over his newly minted body. &quot;Scrub harder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Jeff said, putting more pressure into his rubs and practically massaging the clone&#39;s nudity. He ran his hands down the clone&#39;s back, feeling the muscles flex and contract beneath the skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about the front?&quot; the clone asked, turning to face Jeff. &quot;Can you get that, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitated a moment, what was he doing rubbing down another boy?  He calmed himself with the realization that it was just like washing himself, no different really except for the angle.  He squirted more soap onto his hands and pressed them to front of the clone&#39;s body. It seemed so strange seeing what was effectively his own form from a different angle.<br />
<br />
The clone was lean and fit, with a slight hinting of muscular definition in his arms and shoulders. His stomach was flat and toned, with the beginnings of a six-pack poking through the skin. His thighs flexed as Jeff&#39;s hands slid down them, strong and thick, and his cock hung between them, the flaccid shaft at about six inches with his large balls dangled back and forth with each movement. The clone had a slight tan, and his skin was smooth and soft, with just a light dusting of hair over his arms and legs. Everything was the same as Jeff including his deep brown hair and green eyes.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t help but notice the clone&#39;s body. He had always considered himself pretty average, but seeing the clone up close made him realize how attractive he was. It was hard to believe that this beauty in front of him was technically him.  How narcissistic was that?<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got a great body, Jeff.&quot; the clone said, interrupting Jeff&#39;s thoughts. &quot;Do you work out a lot or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head. &quot;No, not really. Just a little, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, I think I&#39;m lucky to have this body now, too.&quot; the clone said. &quot;And I&#39;ll bet a lot of people would agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot; Jeff said, his face flushing red. &quot;Hey, turn around and let me get your back.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clone obliged, turning and leaning back into Jeff&#39;s touch. Jeff rubbed all over the clone&#39;s back, enjoying the feel of the skin and muscles under his fingers, his skin and muscles. The clone seemed to enjoy it as well, letting out a low sigh as Jeff worked his hands down to the clone&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t help but feel himself stiffen a little. The clone&#39;s ass was perfectly round and firm ant the twin globes of flesh bounced at his touch, and the muscles clench and unclench as the clone shifted his weight from foot to foot.<br />
<br />
Jeff continued to soap up the clone&#39;s body, enjoying the sensations. He worked his way down the clone&#39;s legs, massaging the muscles and running his hands over the smooth skin.<br />
<br />
As he worked his way back up, Jeff couldn&#39;t help but notice the clone&#39;s growing erection. The cock was now fully erect, and stood proudly at attention. Jeff felt his own cock stiffening in response, and his hand drifted slowly towards the clone&#39;s member.<br />
<br />
The clone let out a soft moan as Jeff wrapped his hand around the hard shaft, peeling back the foreskin and stroking gently. The clone&#39;s cock, hot and thick, throbbed in Jeff&#39;s hand. Jeff stroked faster, feeling his own arousal growing as he watched the clone&#39;s pleasure buil with the tensing and flexing of muscles, his breath quickening.  The clone was close, and Jeff stroked faster, urging the clone on with each quickening move up and down the wet shaft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, Jeff!&quot; The clone moaned as his orgasm hit, his cock spasming in Jeff&#39;s hand and spurting hot cum all over the shower wall. His knees buckled, and he grabbed the shower door for support, his breathing ragged.<br />
<br />
Jeff let go of the clone&#39;s cock, his own hand now covered in sticky ooze.  &quot;How does that feel as a welcome to the world,&quot; Jeff said, letting the shower wash the white fluid from his hand.<br />
<br />
The clone smiled weakly. &quot;Wow, that was amazing. I didn&#39;t know orgasms were that intense.&quot;  The clone breathed heavily and turned to look at Jeff.  &quot;Okay,&quot; he exhaled, &quot;I definitely forgive you for never washing me before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to hear it.&quot; Jeff said, turning off the shower. &quot;Come on, I&#39;ll dry you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sounds good.&quot; the clone said, still panting<br />
<br />
Jeff toweled the clone off, drying the wetness from his body. The clone sighed, leaning into Jeff&#39;s touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Jeff.&quot; the clone said. &quot;This has been a pretty awesome first day. Even if you turn me back into a sock later I&#39;m glad you created me, just so I could feel that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me, too.&quot; Jeff said, finishing up and leading the clone back into the room.<br />
<br />
The two sat down on the bed, the clone&#39;s naked body glistening with the moisture from the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what now?&quot; The clone asked.</p>
