<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy spent the next hour answering Master’s questions.  At first she had been asked about both of her lives, about who Troy had been, what had led to him getting the book, what he had done with the book.  Then the questions had turned to Stinkbitch, how she lived, what she had endured, how she felt about it, how Troy felt about it.  Troy got the sense that the latter question, how Troy felt, was Master’s most important and that he was thrilled at how pathetic and humiliated Troy felt.<br />
<br />
Then the questioning turned to the books and what Troy knew about how they functioned.  She answered truthfully and told Master everything she knew about the conditions under which they altered reality, as well as the conditions under which people would keep their memory.<br />
<br />
Finally, the questions turned to Stinkbitch’s body.  Troy told Master how unpleasant it was, how her scent gland and breasts were painfully overfilled.  How she couldn’t drain any of them.  How her various fluids were leaking out.  How everything was sore, everything was weak.  How unpleasant it was to move, to exist.<br />
<br />
Then Master had looked down at Troy’s belly, “And how does that feel?” he asked.<br />
<br />
Troy told him about the pressure, about how the baby’s head was sitting in her pelvis, how it compressed all of the sensitive tissues in her abdomen.  She told him how it pulled on her back, how it stretched every muscle.  How, as an anthropomorphic tiger, she’d had a false contraction.  She told him how the baby had changed, how it had grown scales that were cutting into her insides.  She told him how scared she was that her water would break, that it was too big to fit, that she would rip herself apart trying to get it out.<br />
<br />
Master started laughing as soon as Troy mentioned how afraid she was to birth the monster inside of her.  That laughter, combined with her own terror of having no idea what she was carrying caused a small amount of courage to well up inside of her.  She had to take the chance.  She had to ask.  She had to know.<br />
<br />
“Masser… pweese… pweese well me.   Wwaw wis inswibe of mwe?”<br />
<br />
That just caused Master to begging pounding one of his front feet into the ground as his laughter intensified.<br />
<br />
“Oh my!”  Master exclaimed, “you don’t know?”<br />
<br />
“nwo… dwey… wid wis wo mwe,” Troy said as she glanced over at the kobold guard.<br />
<br />
“Well my little Stinkbitch, unfortunately for you I don’t know either,” replied Master.<br />
<br />
“Bwu… wyuu mwade mwe!  Hwow dwo wyuu nwah nwo?”  Troy cried out in exasperation.  Was Master just screwing with her?  Just toying with her to see how she reacted?<br />
<br />
Master chuckled, “I suppose it doesn’t do any harm to explain your new lot in life”<br />
<br />
“You see, your new life.  Everything about you.  Its all a series of experiments that I created.  The first experiment was to see if you remembered who you were, whether you remembered this life or your old one.  The next experiment was to figure out how the books work, how they alter reality and memories.”<br />
<br />
Master paused, “you’ve been very helpful in those experiments Troy.  I want you to know that I’ve learned a great deal from you, and I appreciate how forthcoming you were with me about your own knowledge of the book’s functionality.”<br />
<br />
Master gestured towards a small marble stand next to him.  Sitting on top of it was a book that looked almost identical to Troy’s Book of Beasts – the Book of Myth, she realized!  <br />
<br />
“That’s why I’ll tell you about the other experiments,” Master continued, “the third experiment was to test how specific I need to be when casting a spell.  When I made these kobolds I came up with a very specific picture in my head for each one, a very specific backstory as to who they were and what function they would serve.  Then the book had made them exactly as I had imagined them, every detail fulfilled to perfection.”<br />
<br />
“But what if I didn’t come up with anything?  What if I just gave a very vague description of what I wanted you to be?  For you, Troy, I didn’t picture anything in my mind.  I didn’t imagine you in your current form – or any other form – I just cast the spell while thinking that you should be the most pathetic, disgusting creature in my realm.  That you would be something truly worthless, with less value than even the lowest vermin skittering through this mountain.  That you would be something whose sole purpose in life was to suffer, to be a burden to yourself and everything around you,” Master laughed.<br />
<br />
“To be frank with you Troy, I didn’t think the spell would do anything.  But then you turned into… well… you turned into that.  Your overwhelming stench, your big leaky tits, your swollen needy pussy, and whatever it is that’s currently growing inside you.  I have few limitations Troy, but even I would have had difficulty imagining such a life for you.  You’re the perfect embodiment of my desire for the most pathetic creature imaginable.”<br />
<br />
“So no Troy, I have no idea what’s inside of you.  I would, of course, assume that its something truly horrible.  Something that won’t come out easily.  Something that you’ll spend days suffering to birth as every fiber of your being soaks in agony.  But I honestly don’t know, it is possible the book took ssome small amount of mercy on you, after all.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, there is the fourth experiment.  I hadn’t thought of it until you told me about your own fears for the birth, but now I’m wondering if you’ll be able to get it out or if its too big?  Or maybe too sharp?  Will you die?  Will you just be stuck, laboring for the rest of eternity to push out a baby that can’t fit?  I’m rather curious how cruel the book has been to you Troy and I’m delighted that we’ll both get the opportunity to find out.<br />
<br />
Troy’s heart sank.  She couldn’t believe what she had just heard.  That her life, her entire existence, was just a game to Master.  That he would toss her away as easily as he would the trash.  No, it was worse than that.  People don’t hold malice towards their trash, but it was clear from Master’s insane plan, his cruel desire for her, that Master was malicious.  That Master wanted Troy to suffer.  That Master enjoyed inflicting this indignity on her, and that he might inflict even worse if given the chance.  <br />
<br />
Troy’s mouth moved on its own, “masser… pweese… wis is mwah weyefh…”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Master replied, his eyes glowing with delight, “it certainly is.”</p>
