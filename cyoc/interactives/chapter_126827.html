<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the course of the week the fight was the talk of the student body. Rumors and tall tales emerged as to how it started and what happened. By Friday things were beginning to calm down but not without some consequences.<br />
<br />
Mika, Claudia, Ashley and Jennifer had all taken a hit popularity wise. It proved to be hardest for Mika and Claudia. The girls Claudia had trusted at school seemed to turn their back on her going so far as to exit the locker room when she entered. As for Mika a cruel note was shoved into her locker calling her Little Orphan Annie. Despite these set backs they were adjusting to their new home lives and thankful to have Katie, Kellie, Samantha and Mary Elise by their sides. The girls now found themselves wth a free period on a sunny Friday afternoon as they sat in the school courtyard.<br />
<br />
“So how are things going at Claudia’s?” Kellie asked. Mika smiled as she looked over at her girlfriend. “Well the major is definitely interesting,” she giggled. “Claudia wasn’t kidding when she said he would have us up early and doing chores. I’m sore in places I didn’t think could get sore. Still I think he likes having us around.”<br />
<br />
Claudia smiled as she lay out in the sun. “Yeah daddy is definitely liking it,” she said. “He misses having the house full of kids. Derrick was only around for a couple of weeks before he left for his summer internship and Cole and Julia rarely visit.”<br />
<br />
“Wow Claudia,” Katie gasped. “How many siblings do you have?”<br />
<br />
“Theirs four of us,” she sighed. “Julia, my oh so perfect sister, is 28 and a doctor in D.C. Ugh she gets on my nerves. She’s tall, gorgeous and can do no wrong in my dads eyes.”<br />
<br />
“Claud she can’t be that bad,” Samantha giggled. Claudia glanced over at her friend and furrowed her brow. “Trust me She is,” she said flatly. “When she found out about Mika and me she asked what I was planning on doing with my little friend. Ugh she talks to me like I’m 10 and going on a play date, it’s annoying.”<br />
<br />
The girls couldn’t help but laugh at Claudia’s explanation as she smirked. “If I can continue,” she smirked as the others quieted down. “So after her theirs my brother Cole. He’s 25 and followed the Major into the family business. He’s been deployed overseas for the last couple of years but he might be visiting this summer. Oh and if you think dad is big you should see him.”<br />
<br />
Katie now tried to imagine what Claudia’s brother could possibly look like, unfortunately the only thing she could think of bigger than Claudia’s father was the Incredible Hulk. “Okay so what about Derrick,” she asked, trying to shake the thought of the hulk out of her mind.<br />
<br />
“Well Derricks 21,” Claudia smiled. “He’s cool and probably my closest sibling. He’s more like my mom than my dad. Average height, kinda quiet, but an absolute sweetheart. He’s interning in D.C. this summer and staying at my sisters. Hopefully he visits later on this summer. You guys would like him, he’s very laid back and a lot of fun.”<br />
<br />
“Wow you have a lot of siblings,” Kellie said in awe. “Must of been interesting growing up.”<br />
<br />
Claudia shrugged as she looked at her friends. “I don’t know, I guess,” she said. “I was kind of a surprise so the age difference between us made things harder than it should be. Cole and Julia always treated me like an infant that needed to be protected. Derrick was the only one that treated me like an equal. Guess that why we always got along so well.”<br />
<br />
“So anybody have any plans this weekend,” Samantha asked. The girls shrugged as they gazed out across the campus. “Not really,” Katie said. “Lisa still has me kind of on lock down.” <br />
<br />
“Same here,” Kellie sighed. “My folks don’t seem to thrilled about me going out anywhere.”<br />
<br />
“I’m pretty sure the Major has something planned for me and Claudia,” Mika groaned. “I saw him making a list before we left for school today. What about you Mary?”<br />
<br />
Mary Elise smiled sheepishly as she looked at the girls. “Well My folks weren’t thrilled about the fight but they’re still letting me go to Comic Con with Sebastian.” The girls broke into congratulations and smiled as Mary grinned broadly. “You know,” she said. “Maybe you guys to come with us. I mean it’s worth a shot and what’s the worse that could happen.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm, maybe,” Claudia said. “It’s worth a shot.” The others nodded in agreement as they continued to talk.<br />
<br />
The girls conversation was interrupted by the sound of a something breaking. Turning towards the noise they could see their teacher Ms. Walters bending over to pick something up. The elderly woman had dropped a box filled with books that now spread across the parking lot.<br />
<br />
“Poor Ms. Walters,” Samantha sighed. “I can’t believe the school is forcing her to retire. She’s one of the best teachers I had this year.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh I know,” Mary Elise sighed. “They let her go yet they keep that burnout Ms. Abbott and have her take her place. She sucks sooo bad.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie looked out at the parking lot as the elderly teacher was attempting to pick up her belongings. As she was struggling the girls could see a woman in her mid forties approach. Although they were too far to hear what they a were saying they could get a pretty good idea of what was going on.<br />
<br />
The woman in her mid forties was Ms.Abbott. She was a skinny woman with dark hair and a narrow face. She appeared annoyed by the elderly woman’s presence and seemed to be verbally accosting her telling her to go. The elderly woman looked on the verge of tears as she tried to gather her belongings and place them in her car. As the girls watched they couldn’t help but feel sorry for Ms. Walters and feel anger towards Ms. Abbott. Kellie turned towards Katie and nodded. Katie understood as she smiled. “Hey guys,” she grinned. “Check this out.” The girls watched with interest as Katie made a wish.<br />
<br />
Ms. Walters shivered slightly as her regression began. The 70 year old woman’s body seemed to strengthen as the wrinkles and grey/white hair was gradually replaced with a dark, luxurious black. Ms. Walters hair began to grow out and cascade down her back as she youthened. By the time she became 40 Ms. Walters was an attractive woman with full and slightly saggy d cup breasts and a mature yet beautiful face. Still the woman continued to youthen as she reentered her thirties. Ms. Walters face seemed to glow with youth as the slight lines around her eyes vanished and her breasts perked up even more. The girls could even see the woman regaining curves that had softened over the years. Katie completed her regression at 32. Ms. Walters was now a bombshell of a woman with full curves, perky d cup breasts and a beautiful unlined face highlighted by emerald green eyes.<br />
<br />
As for Ms. Abbott her regression was a much different story. Ms. Abbott quickly left her forties and returned to her thirties. The lines around her eyes and the streaks in her hair vanished as she quickly approached thirty. Katie and others grudgingly admitted she was attractive however she couldn’t hold a candle to the woman that was Ms. Walters. Quickly though Ms. Abbot was racing through her twenties, her face becoming softer and more innocent as she creeped closer to college. By the time Ms. Abbot became 20 the girl had a smooth, youthful face with perky c cup breasts and a slim figure. Katie wasn’t finished with Ms. Abbot yet though as the woman left her twenties and became a teenager.<br />
<br />
Ms. Abbott, or Cassie Abbot as she would soon be known, began to lose the curves of her twenties leaving her a skinny girl with perky breasts and a youthful innocent face. The girls watched as Cassie began the decent through high school. The senior Cassie possessed perky breasts but looked a bit thin. Still she possessed a beautiful face framed by long black hair that descended to her waist. As she retreated through high school though Cassie’s face became even more youthful as her breasts shrank and her curves melted away. For a moment the girl was 16 like them, a waifish girl with perky b cups and a shy but beautiful face. In a moment though the girl became a freshman of 15. Cassie shrank an inch or two leaving her now only slightly taller than Mika. The girl possessed a pair of perky b cups perched atop a coltish body. She was cute for a freshman however she would not be turning heads for quite some time. The girl also appeared to be somewhat shy as she hung her head ever so slightly as she now helped her bombshell of a teacher gather her belongings.<br />
<br />
Katie now adjusted the clothing on Cassie and Ms. Walters. The teacher, who had been wearing a pair of slacks with a frumpy blouse, found her clothing transform into a stylish yet appropriate dress that descended to her knees finished off with a pair of heels. Cassie in turn saw her now baggy clothing transform into a stylish purple and black t shirt with a pair of baggy jeans and converse sneakers.<br />
<br />
“Holy crap,” Mika whispered. “I can’t believe it.” <br />
<br />
The girls nodded as they looked at Cassie and Ms. Walters. “So,” Mary Elise asked. “Does anyone remember them as they used to be cause right now that’s all I can remember.”<br />
<br />
As Mary Elise finished her sentence new memories flooded into the girls heads. Cassie was a shy emo freshman girl who was lost in the shuffle of high school. The girl would of had a miserable time if not for Ms. Walters. The teacher, who was popular with all of her students, took the girl under her wing, helping her adjust to high school. As a result Cassis flourished and while still shy she seemed to be adjusting well to high school. She now looked at Ms. Walters as a hero and hoped to one day follow in her footsteps. The girls watched as Cassie smiled at her teacher as she helped gather her belongings.<br />
<br />
“Wow,” Claudia exclaimed. “I can’t believe you turned Cassie Abbott into an emo freshman girl.” The girls giggled as they watched Cassie help her teacher carry her belongings inside. “And on the plus side it doesn’t look like Ms. Walters will be forced into retirement anytime soon.”<br />
<br />
“What can I say,” Katie smirked. “I’m starting to get really good at this whole wishing thing.”<br />
<br />
The girls now began talking in an animated and happy fashion with hopes they could talk their parents into joining Mary Elise this weekend.</p>
