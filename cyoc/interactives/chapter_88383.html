<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joey ran his fingers over the ring &quot;you know Amanda, that wasn&#39;t very nice of you to eat me, especially after how kind I was to you by granting your wish&quot; <br />
<br />
Amanda even in her dinosaur form began to take a step back in fear of the ring and its power. &quot;Joey...&quot; She thought to him &quot;I&#39;m sorry, my instincts just... Took over&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes that may be the case but you still acted on them&quot; he silently wished ring would never leave his body. &quot;Now lets see how you like it?&quot; <br />
<br />
He shouted &quot;I wish I were a T-Rex and Amanda was human again&quot; with that Joey felt his body swell, his thighs grew with muscle as his feet shifted and formed claws. His skin became rough and a scale hide covered his body as it grew in hight. He could feel his teeth grow sharp and jagged while a pinching sensation took hold in his spine as it exploded outward with flesh becoming a powerful tail. His face followed as his nostrils flared and expanded with his jaw, his neck stretched and as it reached end he let out a powerful roar that shook the earth around him.<br />
<br />
As joey&#39;s transformation had continued Amanda found her perspective changed, as Joey had ascended, she had shrunk. Her body becoming soft and weak. She stood there naked, face to face with Joey, in silence.<br />
<br />
He bent down and turned his head, starring at her with one prediatric eye and thought &quot;well? What are you waiting for?&quot; <br />
&quot;What do you mean&quot; she replied in a trembling voice.<br />
&quot;Well, I want this to be fun! So... You should start running. Ill even give you a head start. Ill count to ten&quot;<br />
<br />
He lifted his foot and stomped. 1<br />
Amanda still stood there in shock.<br />
He planted his food down again. 2<br />
Amanda finally got the hint an turned on her heal. 3<br />
Amanda broke into a full sprint. 4<br />
She turned the corner of the library when she herd a loud roar followed by Joey&#39;s thought &quot;ok, so I lied&quot;<br />
<br />
Thunder broke out behind her as she still ran for her life. Joey powered through the street hot on pursuit, each step shook the ground leaving indents in the asfault. He was barely going full speed. His new instincts picked at the back of his mind. Hunger slowly set in. As he chased Amanda down the road Joey began to scoop the other fleeing pedestrians in his jaws. Swallowing 3 whole and 2 he chew as they&#39;d tried to duck or jump out of his way. <br />
<br />
He held no remorse or regret. After all he could just wish them back to life after his rampage. Joey decided it was time to stop playing with his food, he quickly charged and headbutted Nicole onto the ground. <br />
<br />
He flared his nostrils at her, blowing her hare about her head. Joey made another wish to himself, that Amanda would become digested but still maintain here conciseness. She stood up about to run again when Joey came down right on top of her with his jaws. Taking her in one bite he through his head back and felt her slide down his throat.<br />
<br />
She stirred in his stomach, she fought back, kicking and punching. He made a quick wish that he wouldn&#39;t throw up and felt much better. He continued to rampage through town. Devouring anyone to slow to escape him. Amanda was buried under the carnage unable to struggle.<br />
<br />
Joey made his way back to the library once he felt his bowls begine to stir. When he arrived he knew it was time. He found a plot of grass, spread his legs and squatted his knees, and released his load.<br />
<br />
Each push released a clump of shit. Once a person was now the lowest form of excistance. He wondered which one was Amanda. When he was done he looked the car sized pile of excremental. <br />
<br />
A hand burst from the steaming mound, followed by a head gasping for air. As Joey expected Amanda had gone through the digestion and reformed at the end.<br />
<br />
As she pulled herself from the pile Joey laughed loudly at her. Which in his dino form came out in the low rumble of roars. After she was clear of the mess he wished her clean. <br />
<br />
He thought to her &quot;well have fun on your little trip?&quot; She shot him a dirty look, which considering past events was incredibly ironic. &quot;Okok, were even. Now what?&quot;</p>
