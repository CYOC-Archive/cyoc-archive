<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg and Kim parted from the other couple made their way back to their room. Greg&#39;s muscles were still pumped from the heavy lifting, and the scent of sweat and musk was intoxicating Kim. Kim could feel it too—the raw confidence radiating from her husband as he flexed his arms playfully before stepping into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Greg stripped down showing his impressive body. Everything looked swollen, including the python snaking from his boxers. He signaled for her to undress and follow her and she complied. He turned on the shower, the steam rising as they stepped in together. The warm water cascaded over their bodies, washing away the remnants of their workout. Greg ran his meaty fingers over his body, enjoying the feeling of strength, while Kim massaged his arms, grinning.<br />
<br />
“You like what you&#39;re feeling babe?” he teased. He looked down into his small petite wife. Caressing her body and giving a firm squeeze to her perfect breasts.<br />
<br />
Greg moaned. “I never knew I looked this good before. I always thought I was average but after seeing you lift... you looked unstoppable in there. And the way that couple was looking at us—like they could see it too.”<br />
<br />
Greg chuckled. “Well, I did just get mistaken for a powerlifter&quot; as he puffed out his pecs, water streaming down like a waterfall over a mountainous cliff. Kim couldn&#39;t help but marvel and massage his chest. Rubbing her delicate hands through the solid pecs, feeling the wet hair tickling her fingers. Greg was getting hard, the 8 inch pole rising.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fuck. This feels so good&quot; Greg coos. &quot;I&#39;ll make you feel good too babe.&quot; <br />
<br />
He turns her around and starts fingering her lady parts. Hitting all the right areas because of his familiarity with it. In no time, Kim was drenched. &quot;You ready for all this man?&quot; Greg whispers into his wife&#39;s ear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, daddy. P-please. I need it in me&quot; Kim whimpered. <br />
<br />
Greg starts pummeling back into Kim while she bent over in the shower, water splashing everywhere. Kim felt like her brains were melting with each thrust. After Greg blew his first load, he just turned her around, ravenous and lifted her for another fuck.	  <br />
<br />
In their post-coital glow, they laughed together, letting the water refresh them before stepping out and drying off. As Kim toweled her hair, Greg turned to Kim. “I feel like buying something nice.” Kim, still flushed, raised a brow. “Shopping spree?”<br />
<br />
Kim swallowed, feeling a complicated mixture of emotions swirling inside her. Greg was happy. More than that—he was thriving. And a part of her… a small, secret part… kind of liked the way he took charge.<br />
<br />
Greg nodded. “Something about lifting heavy makes me want to celebrate. Plus we don&#39;t have too much clothes with us.”<br />
<br />
Greg prowled over and took her hand in hiss, his grip firm but gentle. &quot;I’ll take care of you,&quot; he promised. &quot;I’ll protect you. I swear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim wasn’t sure whether to be comforted or terrified. She still wanted to return to her original body but since the swap, she started feeling more comfortable just following whatever Greg wanted. She also had a sinking feeling that Greg had no intention of ever switching back.<br />
<br />
Throwing on some casual clothes, they headed out to the mall nearby. As they walked through the mall, Greg remembered to slow down his pace and looked at Kim with a mischievous grin, his energy still electric from the gym. He knew what he wanted to see his wife in. He made a beeline for a lingerie store, eyes twinkling with excitement.<br />
<br />
Kim hesitated at the entrance, glancing around. “Uh, Greg, are we really—?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” he cut her off, grabbing her hand and pulling her inside. “If I’m embracing my strength, you should embrace something new too. Plus! It&#39;s our anniversary!”<br />
<br />
Kim sighed but couldn’t deny the way Greg’s confidence had been affecting her. She felt drawn into his energy, almost compelled to go along with whatever he wanted. The thought of that, being a trophy wife, started to not sound so bad to her.<br />
<br />
Greg ran his fingers over lace and satin, plucking out a delicate pink thong and holding it up to Kim’s waist. He licked his lips and felt blood rushing to his package. “I think this would look great on you.”<br />
<br />
Kim shifted uncomfortably. “I don’t know if—”<br />
<br />
Greg leaned in, his voice low. “You trust me, right?”<br />
<br />
She swallowed, then nodded.<br />
<br />
“Then try it.”<br />
<br />
Before she could argue, Greg had already gathered a few pairs—a mix of silky panties, lace-trimmed thongs, and some cheeky cuts. He already knew her size and picked out all the bras that would accentuate her breasts.<br />
<br />
Kim sighed again, but she couldn’t help but feel a strange sense of excitement as Greg kept choosing lingerie for her.<br />
<br />
As they left the lingerie store, Kim was still processing what had just happened, but Greg was already full of energy, ready for the next step. He pulled her through the mall, his eyes scanning through different stores with laser focus.<br />
<br />
“Now, it’s my turn,” he said with a grin, pulling him toward a store specializing in fitted clothing.<br />
<br />
Kim watched as her husband moved confidently through the aisles, muscles flexing beneath the tight tank top he wore, and black fur popping from his chest under the fabric. His natural confidence was magnetic, and it was clear he was not going to let anything hold him back.<br />
<br />
He picked out a few items—a tight, muscle-hugging t-shirt that showed off her arms and chest, as well as a fitted jacket that would accentuate his curves and strength.<br />
<br />
Greg eyed a pair of high-waisted leggings. “What do you think? Should I show off my legs too?”<br />
<br />
Kim nodded, slightly in awe of how he was completely unbothered by the attention he was drawing. “Definitely... you’ve worked hard for it” she couldn&#39;t help but say. <br />
<br />
With a wink, he headed to the fitting room to try on the clothes. When she came out, Kim couldn’t help but stare. The clothes clung to her, emphasizing every muscle, and the light fabric highlighted her hairy chest and toned physique. She started feeling the slight dampness between her legs all over again.<br />
<br />
“How do I look?” he asked, her voice low and confident.<br />
<br />
Kim stood there, a little stunned by the transformation. “You look incredible.”<br />
<br />
Greg smirked. “Good. I want everyone to know just how hard I’ve worked to get here.”<br />
<br />
He bought the outfits without hesitation, clearly comfortable in his skin. Kim admired his boldness as they left the store, his presence commanding attention in the best way. Greg grabbed his woman by the waist, bags in the other hand, as they left to go...</p>
