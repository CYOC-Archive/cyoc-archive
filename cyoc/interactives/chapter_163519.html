<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Actually, now that he thought of it, if he was going to change this school into his own vision, shouldn’t he start with yours truly? Yeah, if he was going to rule the school, he was going to have to look the part, and a gangly teacher like himself wasn&#39;t the look he had in mind. Frank looked at the remote, and then grinned deviously. He had a plan and an open period, so it was time to hop into his car and head for the gym to put his plan in motion.<br />
<br />
Now he knew he couldn’t just go to any gym, lest he ends up looking like one of those fatasses trying desperately to lose weight or something like that. Thankfully he knew from overhearing some of the jocks that there was a gym where all the bodybuilders go that was close to school. Bodybuilders huh? Normally he probably would have picked the body of a model one of a bodybuilder. However, the thought of being bigger and stronger than those jocks he loathed, as well as anyone else in the school for that matter, was too appealing to pass up. Plus, he had no idea where he could find male models in this city.<br />
<br />
After a short drive, the teacher arrived and entered the Gym. Yes, perfect. The gym was full of male bodybuilders, just like the jocks said. No way the remote will change him into a fatass in a place like this. Smirking, Frank gleefully walked over to the corner of the gym nearest to the locker rooms while calibrating the remote.<br />
<br />
The first thing Frank did was to set the awareness setting on. He didn’t want to turn into a brainless muscle head after all. He then debated whether to use the Blend in with Environment setting, or the Blend in with People setting. In the end, he decided that to use the Blend in with People option just to be more precise.<br />
<br />
“Goodbye, old average body. You will not be missed,” the teacher said as he activated the remote…. Huh, nothing was happening. At first, Frank was confused. He recalled that Joel was frozen when his transformation happened, and now worried that he used the wrong settings.<br />
<br />
Those concerns, however, were soon to be quashed as Frank felt the bottoms of his pants getting tighter. Looking down he saw that his calves were growing! He theorized that when the awareness setting on, people could move around unlike Joel who froze in place. Frank couldn’t help but to chuckle to himself, he couldn’t wait to intimidate even the jocks when this was all done. His elation, however, was cut short when he heard the sound of fabric ripping.<br />
<br />
“Crap!” Looking down again he saw the source of the sound. His calves were growing so big, that they were beginning rip thought the bottoms of his pants! Was he going to burst out of his clothes? Then, he recalled how Joel’s clothes were the last thing to change in his transformation. Not wanting to give everyone in the gym a show, the teacher ran towards the locker room to hide until everything was over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay not many people around here but I still need t-ngh.&quot; The growing man had nearly tripped as he felt his thighs beginning to grow both horizontally and vertically. It was then when Frank realized that this growing felt... really good, erotic almost. The feeling of his legs slowly growing taller and stronger. Filling up his pants until they... Wait no, he couldn&#39;t get distracted now!<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, the teacher bolted into one of the showers to hide. Once there he set the remote aside and leaned against the shower wall to ride out the transformation. He wasn&#39;t a moment too soon either as when he arrived, his once flat ass started to grow round and plump. Frank couldn&#39;t help to moan at the sensation, especially when his pants couldn&#39;t take the strain anymore, and were destroyed. His underwear followed suit, revealing Frank&#39;s cock standing at full mast.<br />
<br />
Before he could react to this, the teacher keeled over, clutching his stomach. It felt like he was doing a thousand crunches a second. Any fat that he had melted off, and he was left with a strong core, that any man would envy.<br />
<br />
Frank couldn&#39;t stop moaning as the transformation reached his upper body. His back was first to grow, providing Frank with a strong foundation for the rest of his upper-body. His chest was next as they turned into large, well-trained pecs, that split his shirt down the middle. The aching in his arms told Frank that they were next. Biceps and triceps bulked up and destroyed his sleeves. They were even larger Joel&#39;s when he was in his prime during his transformation. Finally, Frank&#39;s shoulders widen adding to that intimidating factor he so desperately wanted.<br />
<br />
The teacher thought his physical transformation was finally done, but the remote had other plans for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha! My d-ugh!&quot; He couldn&#39;t believe it, one of the few things that consistently brought him joy was growing into something better than it was before. As his junk grew, Frank couldn&#39;t take it anymore. He screamed out in pleasure as he came all over the shower wall and collapse.<br />
<br />
It finally over, and to cap off this transformation, the remote gave him new clothes that better fit the man he became. A stringer tank top, some gym shorts, and trainers. Perfect for avid gym-goer like Frank was now. Still, in shock in over what had happened, Frank got up and examined the new man he had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, look at me! I&#39;m bigger than everyone in the school!&quot; After putting the remote in his pocket, Frank confidently walked out of the shower and began flexing in front of a mirror in the locker room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... This is great! No one&#39;s going to push me around anymore. With this body, I can finally get the respect I deserve.&quot; Glancing over at the clock, he figured that he had some time to burn before he had to get back to the school. Maybe he should use this gym to test his strength a little.</p>
