<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Damn it Kellie stop dragging me,” Jack whined as the two went deeper into the woods. Kellie huffed in response, roughly throwing Jack back as the now preteen stumbled and rubbed his arm. “What is with you,” he grumbled.<br />
<br />
“Your what’s with me,” the 12 year old Kellie exclaimed. “You show back up after more than 21 years and just happen to want to meet up with my daughter. I call bullshit.”<br />
<br />
“Our daughter,” Jack frowned. “Remember it takes two to tango their Kellie.”<br />
<br />
Kellie frowned as she now approached Jack glowering down at the slightly shorter boy. “Fine our daughter,” she grumbled. “But I’m the one that raised her their short round remember that.”<br />
<br />
“Hey not cool,” Jack whined. “Not my fault I’m shorter than you right now. Girls hit puberty sooner than boys. Still I think I’m acting more mature than you are right now, you sound like a petulant teenager right now.” Kellie grit her teeth as she glared at Jack. Unfortunately when it came to him her emotions were clouded. When she had graduated from law school and become an attorney at his firm she thought it to be a dream come true. She was so young at the time and still unsure of herself. Kellie had known their was something different about her growing up but just couldn’t accept it. She was attracted to women but she didn’t want to be. As a result when Jack, a partner in the firm, began to show interest in her she buried her feelings. Jack was a handsome older man and she did find him to be quite the smooth character. The two carried on an affair for quite sometime, Kellie burying her feelings for women as she let herself be seduced by Jack.<br />
<br />
For awhile Kellie thought herself happy, she and Jack would go away on weekends saying it was for business. Kellies career took off as a result. Jack would assign her high profile cases and have her participate in trials that increased the profile of the firm. As time wore on though Kellie began to see Jack for who he was as well as realize who she was. Jack would never truely be hers, he was married and would never leave his wife despite his unfaithfulness. Kellie on the other hand began to realize she was lying to herself, she was gay, nothing could change that. The final straw was when she discovered she was pregnant. <br />
<br />
Jack was shocked, as Kellie remembered he at first was worried about what would become of them. A child would destroy his marriage, despite that he wanted to be part of Katie’s life. Kellie refused though saying that she would raise the child herself. Jack didn’t take to kindly to this, threatening to sue Kellie for custody until Kellie reminded him that by admitting he was the father he would in all likelihood end his marriage and end up paying alimony. Jacks wife (who Kellie had met in passing) could be a vindictive women. If she divorced Jack she would make sure she took him for everything he was worth. As a result Jack relinquished his parental rights, going so far as to set up a trust for Katie. Kellie and Jack moved on from their relationship and continued to work together at the firm. Despite the bitterness between the two Jack realized that Kellie was too good an attorney to let go.<br />
<br />
“Ugh,”Kellie groaned in disgust. “Why the hell did you have to show up. Didn’t you make things hard enough the first time we got together?”<br />
<br />
“You didn’t seem to mind,” Jack smirked. Kellie noticed the boys grin, furrowing her brow as she delivered a quick kick to the boys shin. “Ow Damn it,” he cried as he grasped his shin. “Will you stop hitting me already.” Kellie smirked as she watched her former lover hop around in pain. Sure she was acting like a spoiled brat but if she was going to look like a kid she might as well act like one. As she was about to say something she noticed her and Jack begin to glow once more.<br />
<br />
Kellie gasped as she looked herself over. She and Jack were growing younger once more. Kellie watched as her small breasts evaporated into her chest as she shrank in height. Kellie watched as the cuffs of her shirt crept over her hands as the hens of her jeans pools around her shrinking feet. As Kellie looked at Jack she could see the same thing happen to him. Jack now appeared closer to 10 than 12, the boys body was even skinnier now, his face now childish with no signs of maturity. As he now stood to his full height Kellie frowned as she realized the two were now the same height.<br />
<br />
“Great now we’re 10,” she grumbled.”Yeah and whose fault is that,” Jack exclaimed, sounding every bit like the fourth grader he now looked like. Kellie sighed as she sunk onto a nearby log. “Mine,” she whined, kicking at the ground in frustration. Kellie frowned as she looked between herself and Jack. The former teens now looked like a pair of elementary school kids. Two kids who couldn’t seem to wrap their heads around their feelings. <br />
<br />
“So now what,” Jack asked as he sat down next to Kellie. Kellie shrugged as she stared down at the ground. “I don’t know,” she mumbled. “I mean we better figure this out before we get any younger.”<br />
<br />
Jack nodded as he gazed at the young girl. He had to admit that Kellie was cute at this age, a small cherubic face with honey blond hair and a smattering of freckles on her face. An impish thought crossed the boys mind as he reached up, pulling on Kellie hair. “Ow,” Kellie whined, swatting his hand away. “What was that for?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” he grinned. “Thought boys my age were supposed to pull on a girls hair if they liked them.”<br />
<br />
“You’re  an idiot Jack,” Kellie stated before giggling.<br />
<br />
The two 10 year olds laughed softly before sighing, an awkward silence lingering for a moment before one of them spoke. “Look Kellie,” Jack sighed. “Listen, I..I know I was a jerk okay. I wasn’t a fai5ful husband, or boyfriend but when we were together I did like you. I just kind of want us to have a fresh start, a clean slate if you will.”<br />
<br />
“Two problems with that,” Kellie said. “One, I like girls. Two your evil.” Jack nodded in response before looking at Kellie. “Yeah both true,” he said. “But in my defense I kind of a necessary evil. I’m not here to take over the world or anything. I just have to make sure that the light and dark are even. Can’t have one stronger than the other.”<br />
<br />
“So what do you propose then,” Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Jack said thoughtfully. “How about a Cold War. Like the Russians and the U.S. had for years. We talk, we won’t attack eachother or our friends and kind of go about our business.” Kellie shrugged before looking back at Jack. “I suppose,” she mumbled. “But I know you Jack, you want something else.”<br />
<br />
Jack blushed as he now averted his eyes from Kellie. “Okay true,” he said. “Two things. One, I want to get to know Katie better.”<br />
<br />
“What’s the second thing,” Kellie asked narrowing her eyes. “I want us to be friends,” Jack whispered, lowering his eyes. “Yeah I know romance may not be in the picture but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to see you.”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed heavily as she thought things over, she could end this and keep everyone safe by agreeing to Jacks terms. If she did, Katie, her friends, and her family would be safe (at least until they figured out a way to stop Jack and his family). If she didn’t she could put everyone she knew in mortal danger. Placing her hand under Jacks chin she raised his head up, placing a gentle first kiss on the boys lips before smacking him across the face. “Okay deal,” she said. “But don’t think we’re dating again if Our granddaughter grows us up again.”<br />
<br />
“Deal,” Jack smiled, rubbing his cheek. “By the way Ow, you have a hell of a slap.”<br />
<br />
“Had practice,” Kellie giggled. As the two 10 year olds now laughed they looked at one another, their lives were about to get a bit more complicated.</p>
