<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You remember when I told you how much I like taurs of any kind, right?” Ken asks, still smiling.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yes, of course I do, Ken,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “well, I maybe decided to become a taur myself, a human taur!” he says, “however, since we are the bestest of friends and really close… I decided we should become much… closer,” he adds, grinning wider.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen in horror, “y-you… you can’t be serious,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I am DEAD serious,” Ken says, his grin turning evil, “and guess what part YOU’LL become… hehe!”<br />
<br />
Jeff is terrified, “n-no… Ken… please,” he begs, “st-stop this m-madness! Snap out of it… y-you aren’t yourself!”<br />
<br />
Ken grins, getting to his feet and beginning to strip, “I don’t know what you are talking about, Jeff,” he says, “I feel great, I’ve never felt better! My head feels so clear… the power showed me that my purpose is to correct all the mistakes and error of this planet! Starting with myself: I need my true body! So everyone knows how powerful I am and that I DECIDE what is right or wrong!”<br />
<br />
“No… what you are saying makes no sense,” Jeff says, “Ken… please… y-you are being controlled by the power!”<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, “no, Jeff,” he says, “I AM in full control! The power is simply guiding me! Now, enough talk! Strip!”<br />
<br />
Jeff removes all of his clothes as Ken grins, “much better,” he says, licking his lips as he watches Jeff strip session end, his cock erecting at the imagination of merging with his friend. The teen looks around, noticing one of Jeff’s walls is bare, a smile crosses his face, “I want that wall,” Ken says, pointing to the wall, “to become a huge mirror so I can watch and enjoy the change”.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen as he watches his wall change into a huge mirror, “KEN! STOP!”<br />
<br />
Ken turns to Jeff. “Sweet, huh?” he asks grinning, “I can see the excitement in your eyes of us becoming one, just as it should be!”<br />
<br />
Jeff tries to shake his head violently still unable to move, “Ken! This is not okay, this is completely horrible!”<br />
<br />
“Hehe, but you will get used to it… eventually hehe” he giggles as he fully undresses too, showing Jeff his naked butt. “Now you will crawl to me and shove your entire head inside my ass hole!” Ken giggled spreading his rear cheeks in front of his friend without shame.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck Ken! That is so gross!” Jeff yelled as his body moved towards him against his will. “Make this stop!” He screamed harder as he saw Ken’s butt hole getting closer. “This doesn’t make I won’t even fit- mmph- MMMMPH” his talking was interrupted as his lips touched his friend’s anus.<br />
<br />
“Hehe you’re kinda right, but I WILL be able to easily take you!” As Ken spoke he bit his lips feeling how Jeff pressed his head deeper inside his rear, beginning to swallow his face. For Jeff it was a nightmare, his head was being devoured by his friend, not only the feeling, but the odor was equal or more terrible. Jeff pushed even harder while Ken felt in heaven, using taking advantage of his powers to make the whole process pleasurable for HIM, he used his head to keep pushing Jeff’s head until he heard a wet pop sound that let him know he shoved anything from his neck up inside his ass.<br />
<br />
Ken grinned as he looked down at his belly, fully inflated containing Jeff’s head, then he looked back to see the rest of Jeff’s body… or what was left of it. “Now Jeff’s arms will transfer to my upper torso” Ken smiled and moaned as he dictated their changes. Jeff felt how his arms detached from himself as his bones separated, the arms slid through his torso, moving up to displace to Ken’s hips to later move again and stop at Ken’s torso, connecting with his bones, nerves and muscles, finally decorating his upper torso with four arms. “This is amazing!” The four armed boy licked his lips, grinning and flexing his muscles as he contained his now armless friend attached to his butt.<br />
<br />
“Now my hips will merge with your shoulders as my ass merges with the rest of your body, for that your head will become the extension of my bowels becoming one with my rectum, while the rest of your organs disappear as you will be still alive with mine in my upper body, then I’ll be in total control of my lower body” Ken giggled and moaned again as he felt the change in their… HIS anatomy, their bodies merged even further as he explained, Jeff felt terrible as his mouth was forced open to fuse with Ken’s intestinal track, making a one way path from his mouth to his asshole to fully become the extension of Ken’s bowels, resulting with an horrible taste in his mouth and causing Ken’s belly to deflate to its normal size. Then Jeff felt the a worse sensation of his organs vanishing as his eyes, nose, hair and ears disappeared in order to let his head fully merge with Ken’s intestines, as Ken said he was still alive, he could feel how he breathed through his lungs in his upper body as his heart was beating to pump blood through all their shared form, but he could no longer see, just hear through his ears, feel every touch and change in his stolen body and taste his disgusting bowel…<br />
<br />
Ken bit his lips as he masturbated his frontal cock, later feeling the erection in his second penis in his lower body as the nerves finished to merge, his pelvis finished to attach to Jeff’s column as the bones in his legs connected to it too, finalizing the transformation. <br />
<br />
“Oh God!” Ken smiled as he kept masturbating until he came, expelling a good shot of cum from both of his cocks and leaving a total mess on the floor. “Hehe what a mess” the human-taur smiled, walking around in his upgraded body, feeling much more powerful with his four legs and arms. “This is the true appearance of a powerful being like me! Hehe, did you enjoy that Jeff?” He stared at his back, smiling with his human lower body stolen from his childhood friend. “I knew you wanted us to be closer, so I made sure that nothing can separate us now!” He laughed feeling his stomach growling, completely conscious that Jeff was reduced to a mere extension of the end of it. “Don’t worry, ill might give you some work later if you know what I mean hehe, but first let’s see what other fun things I can to now. From now on everyone will think I look normal like this and no one will have a clue of where if Jeff, also everyone will think is perfectly fine to see me naked outside” he giggled again spelling the the new changes in reality as Jeff struggled barely moving is anal muscles, completely at the mercy of Ken now.</p>
