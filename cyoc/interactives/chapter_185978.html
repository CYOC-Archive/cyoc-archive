<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren had altered Jeremy to be completely submissive with no preference for topping or bottoming. He was now attracted to men 15+ and would do anything for a man he was attracted to.<br />
<br />
“Well, did it work?” Asked Jeremy.<br />
<br />
“You tell me, do you find this attractive?” Asked Darren, turning around and pulling his pants down in broad daylight. Luckily the neighborhood was empty at the moment. Jeremy stared at Darren’s little bubble butt in his orange calvin klein briefs.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck,” said Jeremy, “You were supposed to make me attracted to men, not fucking high schoolers! Fuuuck, why does your ass look so good??”<br />
<br />
“Shut up and enjoy your new attraction,” said Darren authoritatively.<br />
<br />
“Yes sir,” said Jeremy, shocked by his own response.<br />
<br />
“Now let’s take this conversation to my bedroom. Neither of my parents are home right now,” said Darren.<br />
<br />
Jeremy wanted to scream, but couldn’t bring himself to do that, or anything that that this hot boy in front of him wouldn’t like. Clearly Darren had made him obedient with the tablet somehow. Now he was gonna have to do whatever this little pervert wanted him too. Big mistake asking him for help. He followed Darren into the house and up the stairs. He could help but watch Darren’s sweet young cheeks as he went up the stairs. Maybe this wouldn’t be all bad. At least he’d get to fuck someone like he wanted.<br />
<br />
“Alright, strip down to your underwear,” commanded Darren. Darren also did the same.<br />
<br />
Jeremy stripped down and was in nothing but a pair of boring boxers.<br />
<br />
“Boxers, really? Listen, from now on you wear form fitting underwear. That way, men know they can take you for a ride whenever they want. Just like you wanted to do with women. Now go to my parents room and change into a pair of my dad’s briefs. You two are probably the same size,” said Darren.<br />
<br />
“Wait, what was that about men fucking me?! I thought you made me a top??” Asked Jeremy. But now that he thought about it, the idea of men entering him excited him as much as the thought of entering them. He was embarrassed. He was a total fag. The forbidden desires he was having and conflicted feelings made his dick twitch with anticipation.<br />
<br />
Darren didn’t answer his question, but merely pointed to the door to his room, signaling for Jeremy to go get changed in his parents room.<br />
<br />
Jeremy went to Darren’s parents’ room. He saw a number of discarded clothes on the floor. He went to the dad’s dresser and pulled out a pair of large tighty whities. While swapping his boring checkered boxers for the ass and bulge-hugging briefs, Jeremy saw a picture of Darren’s dad, Harry.<br />
<br />
Jeremy like what he saw. He picked up a pair of the used briefs on the floor and sniffed the crotch, inhaling Harry’s scent while staring at the picture of him. <br />
<br />
“Fuck. I wanna fuck Darren and his dad. Wouldn’t mind their cocks in me either,” Jeremy said aloud while with a blush. He was starting to get used to the idea that he could enjoy being the one who gets fucked.<br />
<br />
Just then, Harry opened the door to his bedroom to find a full grown man whiffing his underwear.<br />
<br />
“Just who the hell are you, and what are you doing with my underwear?” Yelled Harry.<br />
<br />
A moment earlier in the next room, Darren had heard his father get home early. He knew that Jeremy was about to be confronted by Harry. The only thing that Darren could do in time was reach for his Sexuality Tablet and alter his father with a radial scan. He changed his father’s preference to men of all ages, and dominant with a preference for topping. He hit submit right when his father started yelling at  Jeremy.<br />
<br />
Back in the master bedroom: “Oh, I’m— well— your son asked me to—,” Jeremy said, stunned and not knowing what to do of say.<br />
<br />
“My son asked you to what, you sissy man? A big hulking man like yourself tripping over your words. It’s pathetic. And doing what my 16 year old son asked of you? What, do you do whatever you’re told??” Demanded Harry.<br />
<br />
“Yes sir,” said Jeremy. What was he doing? He could easily take this out of shape dad in a fight. So why did he just want to be used by the fifty year-old? He was mortified but his cock was growing even harder.<br />
<br />
“So you like the smell of my junk, huh? Well then, get some straight from the tap, bitch,” said Harry, gesturing to his groin which was currently under a pair of dress pants. Harry didn’t know why he was enjoying controlling this younger stud. <br />
<br />
Jeremy got down on his knees in front of Harry. He undid the older, somewhat chubby, hairy man’s belt and pants. Pulling them down he stuck his face right into the Harry’s plentiful package. He inhaled deeply. It was the same scent as before but ten times more potent. Jeremy found himself unable to keep from touching himself while he took in the intoxicating aroma.<br />
<br />
“That’s right, rub your little bitch dick while you sniff my balls,” said Harry. He couldn’t believe he was about to cheat on his wife, but he was too horny to stop himself. And when he thought about her, he felt nothing sexually or romantically anymore. Besides, where was he gonna find anther sweet bitch like this guy? He grabbed Jeremy’s head and rubbed it forcefully all over his junk.<br />
<br />
“Sir may I please suck your cock?” Asked Jeremy. He couldn’t help it, the way this hairy daddy was bossing him around was turning him on so much. He wanted to please Harry in whatever ways he could.<br />
<br />
“No. I’m not wasting my load down your throat. I’m gonna show you how a real man fucks. Get on the bed,” Harry commanded.<br />
<br />
Jeremy got on the bed and took off the briefs he had just put on. <br />
<br />
“Now lube up your pussy, bitch,” said Harry, throwing Jeremy a bottle of lube.<br />
<br />
“My what?” Said Jeremy. But he realized what Harry meant. He could now be a hole for men, like he always thought of women as being for him. He squirted and generous amount of lube into his hand and did something he’d never done before. The formerly straight man started to play with his asshole. It felt so good. He stared at Harry who was jerking off and he started inserting fingers one by one until there were three inside him. He fucked himself with those fingers until Harry came over and forcibly removed them, replacing them with his six and a half inch cock.<br />
<br />
Jeremy couldn’t believe it, but it was like his hole was suctioning up Harry’s cock. Before he knew it, the length of the man’s cock was in him. Harry pumped him slowly at first, letting his pussy adjust. Every time that Jeremy tried to jerk off his dick while being fucked, Harry slapped it away.<br />
<br />
“Be a good bitch and just get off on me fucking you,” said Harry. Jeremy nodded in acceptance.<br />
<br />
When Jeremy’s hole started to adjust, Harry really started to go to town fucking it. Jeremy moaned from the unfamiliar but erotic sensation of being taken for a ride. Harry started grunting, taking control of the muscular thirty something’s hole.<br />
<br />
Finally Jeremy erupted. He hadn’t blown a load in three weeks, and he had never came hands free. Until now. His normally sturdy legs became week and shook all over. These shivers ran through the rest of his body as his dick kept spewing more cum. He could also feel Harry’s hot load shoot deep into his ass.<br />
<br />
“Okay guy, go do what you needed to do for my son. You can take those briefs of mine you were wearing,” said Harry, slapping Jeremy’s ass as he went towards the edge of the room.<br />
<br />
“My name if Jeremy sir. Please consider fucking me again sometime,” Jeremy said, blowing a kiss to Harry and writing his cell number on a sticky note on Harry’s dresser.</p>
