<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stacy explored the back rooms to see if she could find a few good employees to turn. It must have been a busy day, because no one was really paying her any mind while she was back there, so she moved through the area with ease. After a few minutes of searching, she found the perfect people to start with, the manager and a truck driver, who looked like they were in the middle of a pretty tense discussion. She decided to eavesdrop on their conversation.<br />
<br />
“Listen Mack, I know the higher-ups wanted this much product delivered, but until I get my maintenance guy to come in and fix some of my shelving units and lighting issues, I can’t accept all of this. You’re going to have to send some back.”<br />
“Rob, I barely have room in my truck to take your outdated product, you better find a temporary solution for this now, I can’t send all this back.”<br />
“Well I can’t accept it, but I need to refill the products I’m low on, how are you going to handle this?”<br />
<br />
With the two of them busy arguing, it was nothing for Stacy to slip in and taint the both of them with her musk. At first, they thought nothing of it. But they kept breathing it in and started to feel weird, hot, and itchy. Stacy made herself visible as enough of her musk had surrounded the two men, they were too in a trance to react to her at all. She giggled as she reached her arms up and stretched her body as she began to peel her pants off. “Well boys, I think you two need a makeover. One on my dick, one eating my ass.” Like mindless drones, the two men obeyed and got into position, one putting his ass right up to the musky futa’s dick, the other slobbering over Stacy’s ass. That’s what started their transformation.<br />
<br />
Robert slammed his ass against Stacy’s pelvis, not realizing that the slapping was getting louder as more fat sat across his waist. His pubes grew unruly as a musk began to form around them. As Stacy’s dick gaped him, his anus rolled into donut and stretched out. His hips and thighs widened as he began to feel pre leaking into his ass. He felt his face start to swell and his chest start to get heavy, his mind filling with feminine thoughts. His dick actually grew quite a bit as his hair got longer, both on his crotch, his head, and armpits. His lips puckered out as he took a more female appearance, the name Roberta coming to mind. Stacy came into Roberta’s ass, washing away Robert, and causing Roberta’s musk to erupt from all her orifices. With a musky creampie, Roberta was done with an ahegao face plastered. Roberta fled her country at a young age and struggled to survive on the streets. A store manager at a convenience store took interest in her, fed her, and taught her. That person even helped her with her “problem” from time to time. She eventually got enough knowledge to get a job at the store she called home.  Her experience added up to the point where she became a manager herself, but was run out of her store as the entire street block was bought by a big business. Luckily, she was able to get in good at a local grocery store where she could share her knowledge (and “love”) with others. <br />
<br />
While that was happening, Mack had started to greedily lick the musky donut that was Stacy’s ass like it was ice cream on a hot summer day. He went from a sloppy rimjob to tonguing her fart box, and he could tell he was doing a good job by watching her spine bend towards him. The once bald man started to sprout luscious red hair as the musk off of Stacy started to change him. Stacy came into Roberta and immediately turned her attention to Mack. “Drink” she barked at him, holding her still dripping dick in her hand. Mack didn’t hesitate to stick Stacy’s meat in his mouth. As he sucked it, his body plumped up quite a bit, rounding his face, chest, and ass out quite a bit. Whatever muscle he had in him was covered in a layer of thick fat and then covered with musky, wirey body hair. His tits ballooned out a bit, but not as much as Roberta’s. He looked like a lumberjack with tits (and smelled like a Sasquatch), but Mack was slowly fading. What was left was a chubby redhead with too much body hair named Marcy, but her trucker friends know her as Red. She loved eating ass, sucking dick, and getting her smelly parts licked. She spends most of her time on the road, and hopes to find a little riding buddy to keep her company at her stops. She loved her rig and took good care of it, more than most of the truckers she knew.<br />
<br />
With their histories and personalities rewritten, Stacy was now free to walk the store however she pleases as she left Roberta and Marcy to each other. Now all she had to do was meet up with Jennifer.</p>
