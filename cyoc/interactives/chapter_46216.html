<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The model was aghast as he stood in the dressing room staring at his <br />
17 inch cock. He didn't notice that the door hadn't latched and hung <br />
2&quot; open. That was all Dustin needed. He could see the guy he'd dubbed <br />
Abercrombie's reflected cock through the opening, and he concentrated <br />
on one word - &quot;LONGER.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abercrombie's eyes widened as his velvety cock slithered over his <br />
fingers with his cockhead plummeting toward the dressing room floor: <br />
20 inches, 25 inches, 30 inches, 33 inches, 34 inches, 35 inches, 3 <br />
feet of soft cock. Dustin blinked, and turned away.  Perhaps he had <br />
gotten carried away. He turned his attached to a stack of t-shirts on <br />
sale opposite the dressing rooms, and waited for the fun to begin.<br />
<br />
Inside the dressing room, Evan hefted the heavy length of flesh <br />
hanging from his crotch.  He didn't think of it as his cock any more. <br />
It was more like a fire hose.  He chuckled and hefted his &quot;fire hose&quot; <br />
like he had handled the real fire hose in his photo shoot at the fire <br />
station last week. It was all strangely surreal. He half convinced <br />
himself that he was hallucinating from a lack of food and diet pills <br />
after binging on pizza after the fire house photo shoot. He shook his <br />
head.  It seemed real enough. He began trying to figure out how it <br />
could happen. It happened to fast for a scientific explanation. Magic? <br />
He shook his head, and glanced at his watch. He rummaged in his <br />
manpurse for his cell phone, but then thought better of calling <br />
anyone. If he did, they either wouldn't believe him and demand he <br />
instant message them a photo - which would inevitably end up on the <br />
internet- or they'd humor him and call the men in the white coats to <br />
pick him up. He needed to go somewhere and think, and maybe talk to - <br />
he panicked.  He had to get out of this store. It was the moment that <br />
he entered that his cock had started to grow. Perhaps there was a <br />
curse on the store that did this to all guys or at least all models - <br />
or maybe it was all guys with larger cocks, as Evan had been nicely <br />
endowed.<br />
<br />
Evan discovered he had to lower his jeans all the way to his ankles in <br />
order to fit his 3 foot cock inside. He was glad he had a 37 inch <br />
inseam, but regretted that his jeans were so skin tight. It took a lot <br />
of tugging but at last his jeans were buttoned.  He looked at his <br />
reflection in the mirror. His eyes started at the nice bulge at his <br />
crotch, but it kept going running down the inside of his thigh where <br />
he had draped it. It was so surreal.<br />
<br />
He opened the dressing room door. Dustin was somewhat miffed, because <br />
from his position, he could only see Abercrombie from the waist up. <br />
The hunky model took a deep breath, and stepped out of the dressing <br />
room. The expression of pain and surprise on his face told the whole <br />
story.  He froze and looked down. Then painfully slowly, he walked <br />
stiff legged toward the door. Dustin started moving for a better view.<br />
<br />
This couldn't be happening Evan told himself. It was something he <br />
hadn't considered. His cock was 3 feet long now - soft. How long would <br />
it be when it got hard?  How painful would it be if his cock got hard <br />
trapped inside his jeans pointing straight down. He stared down at his <br />
swollen cock head peering out of his boot cut jeans. Only slightly <br />
hard, his cock had to be 38&quot; long at least. It felt really weird <br />
brushing his exposed foot as he walked in his sandals.  He began to <br />
wish he had worn boots. The sandals only had a half inch sole, and the <br />
boots had three inch heels. He was worried what might happen if his <br />
cock grew longer than his leg. His eyes fixed on the door. He <br />
regretted that he had put his cock down his right leg inseam instead <br />
of his left, it had looked roomier, and his right thigh was a quarter <br />
inch narrower than his left thigh. How would he drive his car, if he <br />
couldn't bend his right leg. He'd worry about that later. He marched <br />
solemnly toward the door, while doing simple math problems in his <br />
head.  He couldn't afford to get hard.</p>
