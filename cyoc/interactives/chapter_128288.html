<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well Liz if your interested we could go back to my place and hangout,” he smiled. Liz seemed unsure of Todd’s proposal, wondering if he was just trying to take advantage of her. “I don’t know,” she questioned. “How do I know your not going to try something with me.”<br />
<br />
Todd had anticipated Liz’s apprehension. The girl seemed very cautious and would not be easy to convince. He had a plan though and now put it into action. “Nothing funny,” he smirked. “Just sitting back on the couch and watching t.v., that’s it.”<br />
<br />
Liz still seemed unsure but agreed reluctantly. “Okay um let me just grab my purse okay,” Todd nodded and watched as Liz once again entered the storage room to grab her things. As soon as she left Todd pulled out the remote. Quickly he began searching for options. Bringing up Liz’s profile he punched it up and gazed at it. Currently it listed the girl as physical 18 with high intelligence and maturity. Punching up a couple of sub menus he noticed it listed the girl as shy with a high degree of awkwardness.<br />
<br />
“Don’t want to touch those,,” he muttered. “She’s way to adorable with those, but let’s take a look at maturity.” Punching up the maturity option he now read it over. “Maturity indicates decision making and risk taking,” he read. “Someone That is more mature will make more rationale choices than someone who is more immature. Current subject has the maturity of a 64 year old woman. Subject makes rationale choices and is not prone to irresponsibility. “<br />
<br />
“Well let’s change that,” Todd said, lowering Liz’s maturity to the level of a typical 18 year old girl. Looking at the readout he smiled.<br />
<br />
“Subject has current maturity of an 18 year old woman,” he read. “Subject is more open to risk and irrational decisions. High levels of shyness indicate Subject may resist things they are uncomfortable with, however can be convinced to with some persuasion.”<br />
<br />
“Oh that’s  perfect,” he smiled. Todd now browsed the menu options for one more thing. Punching up the menu he activated an incognito mood on the remote. Now the remote looked like an everyday object that would not draw attention to itself. Todd smiled knowing that now he could access the remote without Liz asking what exactly it was.<br />
<br />
Liz now emerged from the storage closet with her purse smiling shyly she looked at Todd. “So I’m Uh ready....I guess,” Todd smiled as he now gestured for Liz to follow him. As the two now began to walk towards his dorm Todd couldn’t help but look at Liz. The girl walked with clenched shoulders while holding her in front of her. Something about the girls shyness really attracted Todd. She had a certain adorable awkwardness that was undeniable. He watched as she walked staring straight ahead occasionally brushing a stray hair from her face. Finally reaching his dorm Todd held the door open for Liz as she walked through. The girl giving him a shy smile as she walked up the stairs.<br />
<br />
As the two entered Todd’s dorm Liz was impressed. Todd possessed a sweete as a dorm room. The bedroom were adjacent to a small living room area. The rooms were a premium commodity for students and those who had them were considered lucky. The living room area possessed a couch, coffee table and large screen t.v. that Todd’s parents had given him after graduation. Liz looked around the room in wonder. “Wow this is your place,” she whispered. Todd nodded grinning. “Yeah I got lucky and my roommate isn’t around so we got the place to ourselves.”<br />
<br />
Liz blushed slightly as she gazed at Todd. “So you...Uh...knew you would em..have...Uh...” Todd chuckled softly as Liz stammered. “Liz relax,” he soothed. “Listen nothings wrong and I told you nothing bad is going to happen okay so just sit down on the couch and relax. I’ll grab us some sodas Okay.”<br />
<br />
Liz nodded shyly as she sat down on the couch. Grabbing two sodas out of the fridge Todd stifled a laugh as he looked at Liz. The girl was sitting stiffly on the couch he feet firmly planted to the floor while looking straight ahead. Her body looked incredibly tense as she waited for Todd to return. Holding the disguised remote he smiled as he returned to the couch.<br />
<br />
“Oh Uh...Thanks,” she said softly as she held the drink with both hands. Todd sighed and grinned as he looked at Liz. “You know you really need to relax,” he said. “Here find something for us to watch.” Todd handed the girl the t.v. Remote who just stared at it tentively before taking it in her hands. Slowly she began to flick through channels as Todd shook his head as an idea formed.<br />
<br />
“Geez Liz,” he said. “Your stressing ME out just looking at you here,” Todd now reached down taking Liz’s ankles and laying them across his lap. The girls eyes bulged slightly as she looked at him tentatively. Todd grinned, This next part was important and he didn’t want to screw it up.<br />
<br />
“Listen you mind if I take your shoes off,” he asked. “I don’t want to get my jeans dirty and figure if you can just lay back on the couch you can start relaxing.”<br />
<br />
“Um..um..I...um...yea ok I guess,” Liz stammered blushing slightly. Todd smiled, things were working out perfectly. Reaching down he took a hold of the brown flats the girl was wearing, slowly removing them and placing them on the floor. “See,” he said. “Nothing bad happened now just relax and let’s watch t.v.”<br />
<br />
“Ummmm ok sure,” Liz stammered as she now laid back and began flicking through channels. Todd smiled as he now held the remote. As he looked down at it he began to thumb through the options on Liz. Their was one option he had thought of once Liz was in this position, seeing it he now made some adjustments. <br />
<br />
“Subject sensitive,” he read silently. “”Subject is slightly ticklish most along rib cage, under arms and feet. Do you wish to change subjects sensitivity?”<br />
<br />
“Hell yeah,” he thought. Making the adjustment he now made it so Liz was now extremely ticklish along all parts of her body. He had always wanted to tickle a girlfriend and now seemed as good a time as any. He also adjusted her sensitivity so that if the two did anything sexual she would orgasm like she never had in her life. Todd now began to put his plan into action as he began lightly tapping on Liz’s leg.<br />
<br />
Liz had been to engrossed in t.v. to notice Todd fiddling with the remote. As she continued to flick through channels she felt Todd drumming on her leg and giggled. “Hey,” she said smiling. Todd feigned ignorance as he looked at her. “What,” he said in  mock surprise. “That tickles,” she smiled. Todd grinned. “I didn’t know you were ticklish,” he said continueing to tap on her leg.<br />
<br />
Liz squirmed slightly giggling softly. “Yes very,” She said. Todd blushed slightly as he looked at her. “I’m sorry,” he said meekly, still smiling. “I didn’t know I was drumming. Hope you didn’t mind.”<br />
<br />
“Um...no...Uh..not really,” Liz blushed now as she tried to avoid eye contact. “Just be...um...gentle Okay. I’m super super ticklish....it’s uh kinda annoying.”<br />
<br />
This was working out better than Todd could of hoped for as he began to trace a finger along Liz’s knee sock. “Kinda of curious where your most ticklish,” he smirked. Liz giggled shyly as she glanced at Todd. “Pretty much everywhere,” she sighed.<br />
<br />
Todd smiled again as he now lightly pulled on the end of Liz’s sock causing the girl to squeak. “Hey,” she giggled. “You wouldn’t.”<br />
<br />
“What,” he grinned. Liz smiled sweetly as looked at Todd. “You were going to take my sock off and tickle me,” me said flatly still grinning. Todd smiled widely still looking at Liz. “Maybe but only if you were comfortable with it. I mean I don’t want to do anything that makes you uncomfortable.”<br />
<br />
Liz could feel her cheeks burning red as she looked at Todd. “I....I....Uh....I don’t know....maybe,” She stammered. “I...Ugh...I guess its okay.”<br />
<br />
“Well how about this,” he said. “I’m just going to tug on the end and see if it comes off. You know how hard it is to take a sock off like that. So you shouldn’t have anything to worry about Okay.? Plus you can always say stop if you get uncomfortable. Sounds good?”<br />
<br />
Liz paused as she looked at Todd. She wasn’t sure about all this but she had to admit she was having fun and Todd was kind of cute. Besides he did have a point it would be awfully difficult trying to take her knee socks off by just tugging on the end. That and Todd had given her the option to just stop if she wanted too. “Okay tough guy,” she grinned. “Do your worse.”<br />
<br />
Todd smiled broadly. Looking down at his remote he adjusted the size of Liz’s socks. Now they were a little bit oversized, not enough to be noticed but would make removing them quite easy. Taking hold of her right foot Todd now gently tugged on it. Liz watched as the knee length sock began to slowly inch away from her knee, exposing more of her leg.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” she whined. “Your cheating how did you do that?”<br />
<br />
“What,” Todd grinned as he gently tugged again bringing the sock to mid shin. “I’m just that good.”<br />
<br />
Liz blushed wildly and began to giggle as Todd tugged again bringing the sock lower. “Your doing something,” she giggled. “My sock is coming off way too easy.”<br />
<br />
“No just have skills,” he smirked tugging again leaving the sock just above ankle. Turning he could see Liz blushing wildly as she shyly turned away. “You doing alright their Liz?”<br />
<br />
“Um...um..yea..just nervous,” she muttered. “I mean...Uh..erm...we just met and well I...I...really don’t like my legs....or my feet for that matter.”<br />
<br />
Todd looked down at Liz’s bare leg in admiration. She had great looking legs from what he could see, firm, smooth and damn near perfect from he could see. “Liz,” he said sincerely. “You have gorgeous legs from what I can tell but if you want I can stop.”<br />
<br />
“No...no,” she said quickly. “I’m...I’m having fun, oh and thank you Todd. You really are a nice guy.”<br />
<br />
Todd smiled, “Damn I think I might be falling for her,” he thought. “She’s just so damn cute. Still, no reason to stop yet.”<br />
<br />
Todd now slowly began tugging her sock again as it slid past her ankle. Gently he began tugging watching as it began to work its way past her heel. Liz looked down in nervous anticipation, knowing in just a few moments her sock would be off and Todd would probably start tickling her. Todd looked to see the girl nervously bite her lip. Giving her a comforting smile he slowly began tugging again as her sock now worked its way up her foot. Almost instinctively she began to flex her toes as the sock dangled. With one final tug Todd removed the girls sock exposing her cute toes. Todd grinned widely as he gently touched the girls toes causing her to giggle wildly.<br />
<br />
“See,” she laughed. “Super ticklish.”<br />
<br />
Todd grinned almost manically as he looked at the shy, ticklish girl in front of him. “I guess so,” he said. “You know Liz I gotta say your a lot of fun. Hope your enjoying yourself.”<br />
<br />
Liz smiled shyly before giving Todd a look of warmth. “You know I am,” she sighed as she settled back into the couch. Todd could only smile now as he traced his finger along her bare leg and feet while Liz giggled. It was proving to be a very interesting experiment.</p>
