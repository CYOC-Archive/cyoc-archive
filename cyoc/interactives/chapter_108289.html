<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Frances usually shied away from greasy food; she could not deny the pizza Ben ordered earlier hit the spot. That or a chance to spend time with her older brother Samson; Samson being a were-dog-Alaskan malamute was letting Samantha’s kittens climb all over him. Everyone finds the scene of two small kitties on the police deputy shoulders comical.<br />
“I thought household pets and weres don’t get along per say,” Samson chuckling as Samantha collects the cats.<br />
“I guess if you adopt them young,” Samantha juggling two kittens more interested in exploring then napping; “they don’t freak out as much I’m assuming.”<br />
“Perhaps I should get a little dog,” Samson gently scratching Jasmine.<br />
“Then get a dachshund,” Frances giggling; “that way he could be mustard out when trying to join the K9 detachment.”<br />
Ben laughs, “I relish your wit mom.” Samantha and Alex also laughing at the obvious hot dog joke.<br />
“Funny,” Samson getting up; “this was pleasant sis. But I got to get home soon. I have and early shift.”<br />
<br />
Frances gets up to escort her brother out the door; outside and out of ear shot she looks at him in his were-dog glory.<br />
“You still want us over for Christmas dinner? Or would you rather come over here instead?”<br />
“I’m not going to give up on getting the whole family back together Frances,” Samson stretching; “if I can get through to mom, then perhaps dad will finally take that religious stick out of his ass.”<br />
“Be careful brother,” Frances asks; “you know how quick to anger dad gets. Don’t let him see you visiting mom.”<br />
“Sis,” Samson looking at Frances; “you never knew this. But after dad kicked you out when you became a were-feline. Mom asked me to keep an eye on you. While you may never get to hear this from her in person, she is proud of you. Not for your life style choices, but for the thriving career as a therapist.”<br />
“Why tell me this Samson,” Frances looking serious; “why admit to spying on me?”<br />
“Because you deserve to know that mom never completely shut you out of her life,” Samson hugging his were-feline sister; “you remember all those times I help you out with money?”<br />
“Yeah,” Frances starting to cry; “what of it?”<br />
“That was money from mom,” Samson answered; “she couldn’t stand to see you suffer, what with you and Samantha struggling after high school.”<br />
“She could of approached me,” Frances sobbing; “why did she use you as a western union boy?”<br />
“Father,” Samson sighed; “he kept a tight grip at the household, after you got kicked out. After I graduated high school I quickly moved out and joined the police force. I would still come over on Sunday’s for family dinners. Mom would ask how my week was, while father would pester me to find a wife and give him grand kids.”<br />
“Now with mom barren thanks to the hysterectomy,” Frances sighing; “you fear dad will go further over the edge?”<br />
“Dad loves mom,” Samson answers; “that much I know. Perhaps after this health scare; mom will finally have the nerve to tell Joseph to put the bible down for a change and agree to be a family again.” Samson does his best to dry his sister’s tears, ”give me a few days; you and I will see mom together.”<br />
“But what about dad,” Frances still hugging her brother.<br />
“To hell with him,” Samson answering; letting go of his sister, Samson steps back. “Will talk more about this later okay?”<br />
“Okay Samson,” Frances answering. Managing to summon a weak smile, she watches her older brother run off into the darkened streets of Moon Lake. Turning around; Frances heads back inside to see Ben kissing Alex just as he leaves through the back door to head home. Watching Ben walk by and head upstairs; Frances approaches Samantha and embraces her life partner. Unable to hold back her emotions anymore; Frances cries, leaving Samantha the task of playing Therapist for a change.<br />

Benton back at home after leaving his daughter to being tested for bi-polar disorder; heads to Frieda’s room to gather the rest of her items for her overnight bag. Feeling bad that he forgot her toothbrush and essential toiletries; Benton heads to his daughters room to pick out some more clothes for her. Seeing some of the item she bought at Awareness on Sunday he takes a few of those garments, wondering if they will do instead of the mismatched clothes he got earlier.<br />
<br />
Benton feeling satisfied at finishing this task, he heads to his study to check up on the responses to the phone calls and emails he sent; fighting back Jack Crawford’s attempt to muscle in on his company. Seeing that he managed to secure most of the voting shares to ensure, he could not be forced out; Benton grumbles as he reads from his business partner stating that some of the shares did get sold to Crawford. While not enough to pose an immediate threat; Benton was not thrilled at having to deal with the Crawford’s again. Benton leaves his study and heads back to his garage. Hoping into the town car this time; he places the bag of items for Frieda on the passenger seat and drives back to the hospital.<br />
<br />
Back at the hospital Benton heads to the exam room where Frieda is being tested; Entering he sees no one there. Getting worried, he is about to flip out when Doctor Abigail Robinson sees and approaches him.<br />
“Your daughter has decided to sleep in the same room your wife is recovering in.”<br />
“Oh,” Benton sighing relieved knowing where she is; “does she have-“<br />
“You daughter is not bi-polar,” Doctor Robinson answers; however something quiet curious popped up during the tests.”<br />
“What,” Benton’s relief going back to worry.<br />
“While it was intermittent and random,” Abigail looking at the results; “you can clearly see three completely different brain wave patterns.”<br />
“Well if this isn&#39;t proof of that bond my daughter told me,” Benton breathes a sigh of relief; “then I don’t know what is. Have you told my daughter?”<br />
“Not yet,” Abigail answers; “I was going to wait until morning after I double check these results.”<br />
“But your certain she is not bi-polar,” Benton looking excited.<br />
“Frieda is not bi-polar;” Abigail answering.<br />
“That is the best news I’ve heard all day today,” Benton showing genuine sincerity as he hugs the doctor before heading to where his wife and daughter are.<br />
<br />
Both smiling and crying; Benton enters Amanda’s recovery room, to see his wife in her were-panther fursona gently stroking her daughter’s red hair as she sleeps in the chair next to Amanda’s bed.<br />
“She’s not Bipolar,” Benton whispering; not wanting to wake his daughter.<br />
Amanda smiles, “good news then.”<br />
Benton nods as he closes the door and quickly shifts into his were-panther fursona. While still wearing the suit Frieda got for him at Awareness; Benton still takes the time to remove it from his body. Getting a chair and placing it next to his daughter he sits down and gives her a kiss as he and Amanda silently watch her sleep.</p>
