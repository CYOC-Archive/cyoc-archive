<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben blinked at the hair growing across his face- it was spreading rapidly across his cheeks and chin. It was still only stubble but as he watched it became bum fluff and now beard. A quick look at his hands showed his wrists and knuckles were growing black with hair. He could feel itching all over as hair grew everywhere. The tingling sensation was erotic in its own way, like thousands of tiny hands touching him all over.  Ben felt excited by the sensations but panic gripped him as he saw his beard beginning to flow downwards away from his face. How was he going to live looking like this? 
<br />

<br />
Ben decided to get home; his net connection was there- the files he'd been trying to get before security locked down the building could bloody wait. Taking a look at the traffic the other lane was empty; the wreck ahead had closed the whole road. He took a chance on the police not seeing him and u-turned in the road, speeding homewards down the empty road. 
<br />

<br />
All the time he was driving the tingling was still there, his beard was resting on his chest getting fuller and longer by the minute; the mane on head was flowing over his shoulders and down the back of his chair Ben could not guess how long it was now. As he moved his feet on the pedals he could feel the thick pelt on his feet. As he drove he began to itch at his chest and belly through his shirt, the hair poking out around the button hole and collar. A finger caught his nipple and pleasure shot through him he remembered how sexual having hair could be. He began to get hard. 
<br />

<br />
There was a turning ahead that cut off some of his journey time he slowed and took the turn marvelling at the feelings of the hair moving under his shirt as the turned the wheel. He floored it down the country lanes. His dick was throbbing hard now and he desperately wanted to see what he looked like.  Up ahead was a small village, he slowed a little but was way over the limit as he cut though it, coming out he took a bend way wrong and flew off the road the car smashing down into a fallow field and slid sideways through the grass and mud. Ben was shaken around the cabin; stuff flew everywhere before the car came to a halt, mercifully upright, though axle deep in mud. 
<br />

<br />
Ben sat there panting, he was shaken but ok, the thick wad of hair had cushioned his neck so he did not have whiplash and he was ok everywhere else. The tingling was still there- he could not imagine what he looked like now. He could not open the door so he wound down the window and clambered out, grabbing his laptop bag and keys as he did. Ben took a quick stock of his surroundings. He recognised the church spire the other side of those woods as close to his house. He ripped off his tie enjoying the feeling of the fur on his hands meeting the fur on his neck. A shiver ran though him and his dick twitched and began to grow hard again. 'Time to get home' he thought. 
<br />

<br />
Using the spire as a guide Ben set off towards the woods at a run. He had only gone 5 yards before he discovered that work shoes were useless on mud he was slipping and sinking. Slowly he returned to his car and opened the boot. He sat on the lip and took off his left shoe, the thick black hair within made his foot seem misshapen and Ben got an idea of how hairy he must be as he took off his sock and saw the inch long black silky hair covering all but the sole of his foot. He put the foot down eager to see his right; the mud slicked between his toes and tickled his hair. A small moan escaped him and his dick became fully hard. His right foot was the same. . He rolled up his trousers to his knees and nearly came as he saw the black mass growing over his lower legs; he looked like some sort of Satyr. 
<br />

<br />
Ben put his shoes into the car and slammed the lid shut. The hair felt like it was still growing. He was worried; it was stopped last time, why not now? Had trying to revert locked the site into a 'growth only' cycle? He had to get back and find out. Orientating himself with the spire he began to run towards the woods and home.</p>
