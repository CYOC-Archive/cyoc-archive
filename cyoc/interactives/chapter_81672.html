<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>I looked around at the white room I found myself in. One part of my mind said that this couldn't be real 
but another part insisted that it was. It seemed impossible that I could have been drawn into the world of 
CYOC but that is what appeared to have happened. I looked around again and tried to make myself as small as 
possible. I was a bit shy but that wasn't why I didn't want to be noticed. When I had been on CYOC the only 
thing I had been wearing was a pair of gray panties with butterflies on them and a gray racer back sports bra. 
I only wore that stuff in private and certainly wasn't expecting to be in front of anyone with only these on. 
I probably would have been more comfortable if I had a shirt and pants on to help hide them but then again I 
wasn't expecting to be hauled into another world. I watched as one person went over to some boxes and appear 
to ponder something before turning away. It looked like he was going to walk away but he stopped with a weird 
look on his face and then turned around and picked something up from around the boxes. I hoped that he would 
be careful with whatever it was.</p>
<p>I was beginning to wonder if Changes had been drawn in to when a girl came up to me and said, "Hi there. I 
noticed you by yourself and wearing only a bra and panties."</p>
<p>I felt embarrassed and colored up. I managed to mumble, "I didn't plan on not being alone."</p>
<p>"Oh," the girl said a bit quieter blushing a bit, "I'm sorry about that. You know you really should shave 
if you're going to go out in public dressed as a girl."</p>
<p>"I don't go out in public dressed as a girl," I almost whispered. "I only put girls clothes on in private. 
If I had known this would happen I would have been wearing my regular clothes."</p>
<p>"So you're a cross-dresser in private?" the girl asked looking a little confused.</p>
<p>"Well yes," I said with a little sigh. "You see I believe that I should have been born a girl. Though when 
I was growing up if you said that or even acted like it you were in danger of being killed. People are more 
tolerant now but I guess that fear is still with me. Of course there are people still out there who would kill 
someone for it."</p>
<p>"I know what you mean," the girl said nodding, "my roommate is afraid of that happening to her. At least 
her family is supporting her and has been since she was four. She hasn't had the operation yet but you 
wouldn't be able to tell that she wasn't born a girl if you met her. You need some clothes on and as luck 
would have it I have some of my roommate's clothes right here. I think they'll fit you."</p>
<p>She was carrying a small bundle of clothes which she handed to me. With a little smile I took them and 
started to put them on. The shirt was white with some silver designs on it. The neckline was just below the 
neck and it was long sleeved. When I put it on I discovered that it was a bit stretchy. Next came the skirt 
which was a burgundy color and had a ruffle at the bottom. The skirt came down to just above my knees and gave 
me a little bit of an hourglass shape. There was also a pair of open toe wedge sandals that were black and had 
an ankle strap on them. "Thanks," I said as I finished putting what she had given me on.</p>
<p>"You're welcome," the girl said with a smile. "At least now you're not just in underwear. Nice tuck by the 
way."</p>
<p>I blushed and said, "Thanks. I just knew how to do it when I was younger without anyone telling me how."
</p>
<p>"Well from what my roommate said those that do believe they were supposed to have been born girls 
instinctively know how to tuck," the girl said with a little smile. "Oh I forgot to introduce myself. I'm 
Tina."</p>
<p>"Rick," I said sticking my hand out. "When I post chapters on CYOC though I use loony28."</p>
<p>"I've read a few of your chapters," Tina says with a little smile, "though I'm not a huge fan of 
transformations. My roommate just loves transformations though. She keeps hoping that she'll be transformed 
somehow. She really wants to experience being pregnant and having kids."</p>
<p>"Well I believer that there is some hope for her," I said with a little smile. "I once saw a woman 
physically transform into a man in an instant."
<p>"That must have been amazing to actually see that," Tina said with wonder in her voice.</p>
<p>"It was but no one on the forums seems to believe that though," I said with a little shrug. Then I started 
giggling and said, "I bet they believe it now if they're here."</p>
<p>Tina started giggling to and after a few moments said, "I don't think we should stay in this room much 
longer. There are a couple obvious ways out. The elevator over there and the three doors on the other wall. 
I've seen one person open a door, close it, and then open the same one again but what was beyond it was 
different. I don't know where we'll end up going through a door or taking the elevator but I feel kind of 
compelled to leave this room. I don't care which we use so I'll leave it up to you. Which do we choose?"</p>
<p>That was a good question. It seemed like Tina wanted to stick with me for a while at least. I knew that 
staying in this room would reduce our chances of being transformed but I did have the compelled feeling that 
Tina was talking about. Maybe we could help each other to avoid being transformed or maybe only undergo the 
transformations that we want. That's assuming that Tina wanted to be transformed. As for me I would gladly 
jump at the chance of being transformed into a girl. So which exit will we take?</p></p>
