<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was kinda tired of looking after Tony. Already on coming home he&#39;d tried to show off his ability to give a punch, on Jeff&#39;s stomach, knocking the wind out of him--and seriously costing him some big brother respect in Mikey&#39;s eyes--so having Tony just gone was more than fine. The sooner the better, as far as Jeff was concerned. If that meant letting him grow up, great.<br />
<br />
That left Mikey and his little &quot;harem&quot; of little girls. While Jeff kinda liked the idea of perhaps getting a Dad back, he didn&#39;t like it at the expense of losing Mom. Apparently Dad had cheated on Mom, prompting them to divorce. Jeff knew some of his classmates with divorced parents and that situation sucked more often than it didn&#39;t--parents arguing over custody and using their kids as ways to get back at each other. No, if Dad and Mom were really divorced, then having him &quot;canonically dead&quot; was the preferable scenario. And this time Jeff would see that he influence Mikey as a kid so that perhaps when Mikey did eventually grow up, he perhaps wouldn&#39;t be a crummy husband and father to cheat on his family and cause a divorce. So Mikey was going to stay four, permanently, and along with him Sharon was staying Mikey&#39;s age as well. If Jeff was going to let Tony go, thus depriving Mikey of his best friend, then the least he could do was keep his crush.<br />
<br />
Jeff wondered what happened to the two other &quot;men&quot; that his &quot;Dad&quot; had accidentally turned into toddlers. What had happened to them? He read through the transformation logs and soon realized that Sharon and Lisa when they aged up might be unexpectedly pregnant, and he might have to deal with that. Great, so not only would he have to get inventive and figure out a way to talk the adult Tony out of the house without confusing him, but he&#39;d have to help Lisa give birth to a &quot;Jimmy&quot;. Perhaps with an older Stacey, she could help Lisa? Jeff did see that Stacey&#39;s adult profession was listed as nurse--and even if that didn&#39;t cover delivery room nursing, at least she&#39;d be better in that situation than not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps instead of letting Tony grow up, perhaps I need to give Tony a taste of what Jimmy has endured?&quot; pondered Jeff as he took note of the timer counting down and began to make a few alterations. With a click Mikey and Sharon were going to be permanently four year olds. Upon selecting Sharon as remaining at four, the Chronivac asked what to do with &quot;Andy&quot;--who apparently had also been one of Mikey&#39;s friends who&#39;d regressed to the womb. After weighing his options on yet another pregnancy needing to be dealt with, Jeff wondered if he really wanted to unbalance the friend dynamics in favor of boys over girls? Already with there being a balance of boys and girls Jeff had to deal with the destruction little boys wrought--mostly at Tony&#39;s hand. Jeff didn&#39;t want to consider what having a majority of boys dominate the friend group would mean for babysitting. At the same time, it seemed Andy had been unintentionally regressed to the womb, due to an error popping up from making Sharon the same age as Jeff. That must of meant that Andy being in this situation was caused by Jeff in the first place. Andy was Jeff&#39;s responsibility in that sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what, perhaps bringing Andy and Jimmy back and then regressing Sharon and Lisa back to being toddlers immediately after would be more than fair--it&#39;d even out the dynamics in Mikey&#39;s friends, and I&#39;d get to see what a real birth looks like,&quot; thought Jeff.<br />
<br />
After Jeff had typed in all the transformation details--learning that just making one change and walking away apparently left a lot of room for logical errors to pop up and cause mischief--he encountered more than a few logical errors that he solved in more than one way. Mikey and any of the toddlers not involved in a transformation were going to be asleep for a nap until it was &quot;their turn&quot;. The only exception being once Sharon or Lisa was pregnant, Stacey would grow up to being a young adult twenty-five year old nurse aiding an at-home delivery for each. And once each had given birth, Tony would then get the opportunity to experience what his friends had, while Sharon and Lisa would return to being four year old girls, and their &quot;sons&quot; would become their &quot;twin brothers&quot;. Jeff hit enter.<br />
<br />
Over in Mikey&#39;s room, as the twenty-four hour timer on the original transformation expired, a shudder went throughout the room. For a brief moment Mike recalled being an adult before growing tired and laying down for a nap along with the rest of his friends. All except Lisa who continued to play with the blocks she&#39;d been turning into a tower taller than she was. Unexpectedly she was able to reach the top of the tower as she began to grow a little bit as her initial aging transformation activated. The tower was so precariously balanced, that when she placed the final block on it, it collapsed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww...&quot; whined Lisa, except she looked around her to see Sharon, Stacey, and Mikey all napping wherever they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all boring anyway, I&#39;ll let the little babies sleep,&quot; said the now six year old Lisa before leaving the room to go find the TV to watch her favorite after school cartoons.<br />
<br />
As Lisa approached the stairs, she grew and moved through Elementary school rather quickly, soon landing at the cusp of puberty at eleven and middle school upon reaching the top of the stairs. Now thinking that Jeff hadn&#39;t come out of his room in a while, and Lisa having a bit of a crush on the older boy at this age, decided to continue past the stairs for Jeff&#39;s room. Middle School soon gave way to High School as puberty stretched her out and filled her out further until she knocked on Jeff&#39;s door she was exactly his seventeen years old, and thinking of Jeff as her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Jeff was surprised at the light knock and even further shocked to see a now teenage Lisa standing at the entrance to his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I put the babies down for a nap. If we&#39;re real quiet, we can sneak in a quick round before they wake up,&quot; whispered Lisa as she pushed her way in and into Jeff&#39;s stunned arms. He looked over to the Chronivac, hoping that an error message wasn&#39;t popping up--but it wasn&#39;t. The transformation was now in the process of &quot;bringing back Jimmy&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;The kids might be down for a nap, but, that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t wake up while we&#39;re... um... having fun.&quot; said Jeff, cringing at his choice of euphemisms.<br />
<br />
Lisa smirked, her hand quickly moving to Jeff&#39;s waist and then rubbing further down the front of his jeans until Jeff felt her hand through the denim massage and cup his privates, which surprisingly aroused Jeff more than he had expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what you really think?&quot; asked Lisa with her continued smirk. It was enough that he accepted Lisa&#39;s kisses and her undoing his belt. Soon he was completing the task for her, allowing her to begin undressing herself. They were soon naked and on his bed, horny as teenagers can be, with Lisa riding Jeff until he came--leaving him panting. With only the bed rocking being the only noise.<br />
<br />
Jeff soon felt as though Lisa were a tad bit heavier on him, and looked up to see that her breasts had grown slightly, and her stomach was not as taught as it had been a few moments ago. It was then that Jeff realized that they&#39;d just conceived Jimmy and he and Lisa were now going through months of pregnancy at an accelerated rate. <br />
<br />
Did that mean that Jeff would have to do the same with Sharon in order to get Andy back? Well, this was certainly more fun than he&#39;d anticipated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff,  I think I&#39;m going to be sick,&quot; said Lisa as she looked a little nauseated before getting up and off of Jeff and hurrying out the room and for the bathroom that was between Jeff&#39;s room and Mikey&#39;s at the top of the stairs. The bathroom door slamming shut startled Stacey, whom the Chronivac was now beginning to age to follow Jeff&#39;s transformation instructions. She woke up completely from being groggy once her body had stretched out to being eight and she was finding napping on the floor to not be the most comfortable thing in the world. Stacey stretched and took at look at the quietly napping two toddlers before tip toeing out of the room as quietly as she could. By the time all of this was done, she was a high school freshman. Upon hearing retching noises from what sounded like Lisa in the bathroom next door, Stacey became concerned for her friend and hurried over and entered the bathroom, only to find a six month pregnant Lisa kneeling in front of a toilet.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing kneeling on the floor?! Let me help you up,&quot; urged Stacey as she came over and immediately helped the swelling Lisa to her feet--by which time Stacey was now a high school graduate and college student in a nursing program. Jeff appeared at that moment, and assisted Stacey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you look about ready to pop,&quot; joked Stacey nervously, only to see a bit of liquid begin to trickle out of Lisa&#39;s vagina and for her to grab Stacey&#39;s arm in pain as labor began. Stacey, not knowing what else to do eased Lisa into the bathroom&#39;s bathtub and started running water while having Lisa sit on the side while it filled with water, with Jeff supporting her back to keep her from falling over  and giving her hands somewhere to grab as she began her contractions. By the time the tub was filled and Lisa eased into the warm water, Stacey now was a graduated nurse practitioner and no longer so worried looking as the baby&#39;s head was beginning to crown. Soon after that, Jeff watched in amazement as Jimmy popped out of Lisa and into the bloodied water of the tub. Stacey expertly fished Jimmy out, snipped the umbilical cord and hit Jimmy hard enough to start his breathing. She wrapped Jimmy in a towel. During which Jeff could see Lisa was beginning to recover rather quickly from pregnancy--looking more and more with each second as though she&#39;d never been pregnant at all as stretch marks disappeared, her breast size shrank back a bit, and Lisa&#39;s energy levels recovered almost like flipping a switch. Meanwhile in Stacey&#39;s arms, the newborn Jimmy was growing in size. Soon the towel he was wrapped in changed into a diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me look at my little brother!&quot; cooed Lisa as she stood up, and Jeff noticed that she was beginning to lose what puberty she had with her breasts shrinking rapidly, her hips compressing inward, and her frame becoming far skinnier.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s definitely got a case of wavy hair, said Stacey adoringly of the two year old as she ran her fingers through the curls of his dirty-blond hair before setting him down in front of Lisa.<br />
<br />
Jimmy stood in front of Lisa as the two evened out to both being four years old, Lisa&#39;s earlier eagerness to see Jimmy translating at this point into giving her twin brother a hug, which the boy in pull ups reciprocated.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re so adorable at this age,&quot; commented Stacey.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think that you could put them down for a nap in Mikey&#39;s room? I&#39;ll clean up in here. Uhh... thanks for helping me bathe them. They were all... uh... dirty from that puddle they jumped in.&quot; And Jeff noticed that the water filled with birth fluids shifted to being dirty with the remnants of liquefied mud that were slowly being sucked down the drain. Said muddy clothes were now in a pile near the tub, including ruined pull-ups that the two had previously worn before their bath. Thank god he&#39;d added the &quot;keep reality flexible to suggestion&quot; feature when trying to counterpoint the possible logical errors that might pop up with his transformations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; said Stacey as she scooped up the now two toddlers in nothing but pull ups and left the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Jeff quickly cleaned up the bathroom, tossing the dirty clothes and shoes into the washing machine downstairs. It was about the time he was setting it to run that he heard a knock on the door behind him.</p>
