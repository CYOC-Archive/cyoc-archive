<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Could you make me a werewolf too?&quot; asked Mike.<br />
<br />
Jericho blinked in surprise of this unexpected turn. &quot;You want be like me?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Jeri, I think it&#39;s going to happen anyways,&quot; said Mike, &quot;I don&#39;t know how long werewolves live, but I don&#39;t want you outliving me. And while I love having a big, sexy wife, I kinda want to be on even footing. So is there a way I can be a werewolf too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jericho smiled and said, &quot;Yes, me make you big wolf too. Easy for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it was easy, wouldn&#39;t I have changed by now?&quot; asked Mike, &quot;I mean, with all the love bites, the playful scratches, the mating we&#39;ve had...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jericho&#39;s lupine instincts were very dominant, but that didn&#39;t mean she was an idiot. But her vocabulary and her thought processes were much more simplified. She had trouble with complex concepts, but anything at a simple level was easier to process. She remembered the Chronivac, but knew there was a more natural way to change Jeff.<br />
<br />
She walked over to the window and looked up. Yes, she could see a full moon in the sky, filling the night with bright light. She resisted the urge to howl to the moon for right now. &quot;This good night for change,&quot; she said, &quot;Full moon allows change. Me just need bite you and let moon shine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that all?&quot; asked Mike, &quot;Is there anything more to it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does Mike want be big wolf or not?&quot; growled Jericho.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok. Just be gentle, Jeri,&quot; said Mike, walking up to the window.<br />
<br />
Jericho smirked and said, &quot;Mike not want gentle for long.&quot; Still, she was very delicate with delivering the bite. Her jaws and fangs were powerful enough to rip the leg off a deer. She placed them neatly on Mike&#39;s shoulder before squeezing. It wasn&#39;t much more than her usual love nips, but it had to be hard enough to break the skin. It didn&#39;t take much effort before her fangs pierced him and she tasted his blood in her mouth. The blood was tasty to her and her predator side wanted more of it. But she wasn&#39;t about to eat her husband, not before he became her mate. She withdrew her teeth and licked at his wound, making sure she got enough saliva into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That...wasn&#39;t so bad,&quot; said Mike with a wince.<br />
<br />
&quot;It only get better,&quot; said Jericho before moving aside, allowing the moonlight to shine over the bite.<br />
<br />
The wound appeared to turned silvery under the moonlight, but then it started healing up with supernatural speed. Then changes started happening to Mike. He had always been a hairy man, but now his hair was getting even thicker. His carpet of virility changed in texture and quality, becoming a real coat of brown fur. The fur quickly spread over his bare skin. Interestingly, his beard didn&#39;t merge with the fur. But Jericho didn&#39;t mind that. She liked his beard.<br />
<br />
Then Mike started changing from hirsute human to wolf man. His fingers clenched as his fingernails became sharper and darker until he had his own claws. His feet rose higher on their arches as his legs grew longer. Soon he was standing on a large pair of wolf paws. His spine cracked and popped as new vertebrate was added to it. They extended out of his lower back, thick appearing on it as it grew into a large, fluffy tail. Mike gritted his teeth as they grew sharper and his face pushed out into a muzzle. Jericho thought he looked a little funny with his beard still on his muzzle, but he also made him more handsome to her. And his wolf ears were cute too.<br />
<br />
But Mike hadn&#39;t been simply shifting to wolf form. He had been growing during all of this. If he had any clothes on, they would have been torn apart from how big he was getting. His bones were bigger and tougher as they stretched into lupine shape. The beer belly he had quickly melted away before a chiseled washboard of abs appeared. His pecs were massive and his shoulders were made even broader by how much muscles packed between them. His legs became pillars of strength as his arms became as thick as tree limbs.<br />
<br />
As ravishing as all this was, Jericho was mainly focused on what was between Mike&#39;s legs. Mike&#39;s balls had become furry like the rest of his body and they were swelling with fertile power. His cock, a bit above average for a human, was growing even longer. Its shape shifted as it grew. The end of it tapered to a point, but it didn&#39;t completely lose the mushroom head. The base of it swelled before it developed into a distinct knot. Behind it, the skin loosened and developed into a sheath for the cock to dwell when not in use.<br />
<br />
Before, Mike had been a handsome human which was enough to win Jericho&#39;s love. But now he was a mountain of lupine masculinity. Like Jericho, Mike was built like a bodybuilder, but he was packed with even more muscle due to being male. Before, Jericho easily towered over his husband. Now he was the taller one, though only by about a head. His now-amber eyes made him a little harder to recognize for the man he was, though he kept his human hair and beard. And between his legs were a large pair of nuts and a massive wolfhood that only another werewolf could take. And above all the physical perfection was a heavenly musky odor of male wolf that drove Jericho absolutely wild.<br />
<br />
Jericho&#39;s pussy started dripping with anticipation. Her tail wagged furiously, hoping to waft her scent to him. She turned around before lying on the bed, presenting her ass and her needy pussy to him. &quot;Please...mate...now...&quot; she begged, her voice high in a canine whine.<br />
<br />
Mike licked his bigger chops and growled in a deeper voice, &quot;Yes...mate...&quot; The rush of his first change has dulled his mind to more primal instincts. A freshly-turned werewolf was a dangerous beast, capable of causing a lot of devastation with their newly-awakened bloodlust. But fortunately, Mike&#39;s sexual lust was even stronger. He grabbed Jericho&#39;s cheeks roughly before lining up his cock. He lunged with a savage might, burying himself more than halfway in. Jericho yelped as she felt him deep in her. She had never expected any wolf to stretch out her tunnel like that. But then he started thrusting into her, leaving no room for higher thought. The werewolves growled as they mated hard, the bed creaking beneath them. They were already so excited, that they were close to the edge as soon as they started. As soon as Mike knotted into Jericho, they both let out a howl as they hit their climax.<br />
<br />
Jericho panted as the intensity calmed down. It was good, but it was too short. She had hoped for more when truly mating for the first time. Suddenly, she gave a yelp of surprise as she felt herself twisting around on the knot still in her vagina. She was twisted until she was facing Mike. Mike was still dominated by his new lupine instincts, but the beastly light in his eyes had dimmed a little, allowing more of the loving man out. He leaned down and kissed Jericho&#39;s full lips. It felt more heavenly than Jericho thought and she melted against him. Her liplocking turned into licking after a while as they showed their affection as wolves do.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s larger hands reached up and caressed Jericho&#39;s breasts. Jericho moaned as she felt him massaging her mammaries with surprisingly delicacy. His thumbs played with her nipples, teasing her a little before he lowered his muzzle and sucked at one of them. Jericho squealed as her pleasure rose, more so when Mike started thrusting again. But this time, it was the thrusting of a loving man instead of a frenzied wolf. While Jericho loved being mated like a wolf, making love like a human was savory and pleasing.<br />
<br />
Throughout the night, Jericho and Mike mated many times. Mike&#39;s knot remained locked inside Jericho and not a drop of his seed leaked out. Jericho felt her womb being stretched by how much he unloaded into her. But even werewolves had their limit and they eventually just lied down on the bed, ready to sleep until morning.<br />
<br />
Jericho&#39;s thoughts were a foggy jumble as she was falling asleep. At this point, it was hard for her to remember being human in the first place, let alone being her mate&#39;s pup. Even the thought of her being once male was hard to grasp now. But she did remember the Chronivac that made this possible. Did she even need it anymore? Perhaps she could make a few alterations to give her a larger pack. Mike&#39;s children would certain be welcome additions. Maybe she could give the Chronivac to her mate as a gift. He might have a better idea of how to use it. But that was all she was able to think about before sleep overcame her.</p>
