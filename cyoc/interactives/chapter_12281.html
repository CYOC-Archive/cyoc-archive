<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All this time George's first bestial lover Leslie has been feeling the passioned drives of her animal self. As if she were a cow in heat and acting almost wild, she had fits of rage. Nothing in her nice house was safe, if it were small she'd throw it at a wall! If something big got in her way it was kicked or like a bull almost the item got butted by her heavy bone head.<br />
<br />
Jane was beside herself and when the time was right, did tie Leslie down. Spreadeagled over her own bed, Jane tied Leslie's hands each to a bedpost. Then with a rope she tied Leslie's still very bovine formed feet together, threading the rope down and under the bedframe to be tied again to the bedposts. Leslie at first did not contest this action but as the heat of sexuak passion built she fought her bonds.<br />
<br />
Standing in the doorway of Leslie's bedroom Jane wondered hard and long if and how she was going to care for her friend. It was easy to see that the intense formula which George used making his body change in a very short time, had infected Leslie, could she be changed once again and be human? Jane watched as the mental anguish was again asserting the growth of Leslie's bovine coat of hair. <br />
<br />
Leslie laid there her head rolling from side to side. Her eyes wide and mouth open as she groaned out her screams begging for release and wanting to be mounted by George.<br />
<br />
Struggling like a caught animal in some trap, Leslie strained hard to break the clothes line type of nylon rope, but try as she did it held fast!<br />
<br />
Not far away a satisfied George lay chewing his cud. He was not alone as Rick being far younger and having been infected by George's desire not to be alone. The strength of youth, Rick's higher body metabolism, was the primary force bringing about his rapid transition.<br />
As George took a couple of days, Rick changed in a very painful manner within hours.<br />
<br />
Rick stood quietly by his larger Bull friend. His thoughts a jumble of instinctive impressions and short enduranced bubbles of rational thinkings. As his transfer of species enhanced his bones, strenght, and sexual vitality these being the three things the Radical Thyroid Enhancement formula was created to do in the first place, Rick was now more Bovine right down to his DNA.<br />
<br />
Soft sounding and bull like moans came from Rick as his human thought patterns battled to be in control his body. The Bovine characteristics which made the basis of the Enhancement formula inbred with the radical change those instictive patterns long set for any Bovine to live and exsist.<br />
<br />
Tears of moments in terror as from minute to minute Rick would realize his transformation. A snuffing of his constantly runny nose and one huge lick of those rubbery thick lips offered no comfort to the weakening human boyish mind.<br />
<br />
Looking through eyes made now of cells twisted into Bovine fashions, Rick peered out at a colorless world. Nature would not waste the beauty of color upon the dull mind of any cow! Rick then being a bull had lost the ability to see the world in color. As he looked at strange undefined shapes, people, each in tones of red, blue, or white.<br />
<br />
As Rick's keen sense of smell directed him toward things which boasted of tasty green stuff, or the sweet smell of new cut hay he had a lessor reliance for his eyes. <br />
<br />
Hearing too was far better and used as mostly a warning sense to his degraded human mind, his thinking ability was drastically limited.<br />
<br />
The sense of touch offered the only real abundance of feeling to be considered. Lips touching food and made to reach, grip, and funnel the treats into a mouth of slab flat teeth. The skin covering his inner mouth would feel the foliage he devoured. Thorns, thistles, grass, all the came in was chewed and swallowed no matter the taste of flavors.<br />
<br />
Touching the ground with cloven hooves made well by nature to make his stance sound and solid. As if now standing on all four legs and the hooves made for some extra nice comfortable pleasure.<br />
<br />
An overly indulged tail, boney, heavy, furred and having that neat feeling burst of hair, the switch. Swung as a weapon against the onslaught of flies wishing to lick his flat butt clean. The feeling of little legs crawling over his sensual rear was in some ways neat and in other ways very distracting. Worse yet were those insects which wanted more than what Rick the Bovine Bull was willing to offer. Blood, some insect wanted his blood and their bites swelled into itchy lumps that drove him crazy trying to scratch.<br />
<br />
Sensual can be sexual as he felt those two heavy weighted testicles now hung low in a hairy sack. They did sway and swing, slapping his hocks and thighs with every step, jiggling the feeling made urges. <br />
<br />
Urges, the feelings built to a desire, the continued sensations added more to the desire making a lust for passion. This pattern filled Rick's mind with thoughts for ultimate release and thus the calming of this cooped up personal need. Like George, Rick was becoming irrationally driven to demand sex upon any female willing or maybe just nearby! This maybe and this alone was the real factor which degraded away the human thoughts into an instictive desire for a return to being at peace.<br />
<br />
So he was a bull and Rick knew it as he tried to understand his own new feelings. Now captured inside a body he was not born to know, his naked sensual beastly self was taking from him all that he had loved.<br />
<br />
Down deep Rick realized his care and love for Parents, his best girlfriend Allisa, his buddies Ken, Arnold, Kevin, and Bill would wane to the thought of them as maybe just some other creatures. He wanted them to know who he had become or maybe what he was then, but with a little thought even this embarressed him.<br />
<br />
Moaning his fate, groaning in a Bovine fashion Rick felt sad to be as he was, a Bull!<br />
<br />
As Rick and George watched the hussle of men and strange equipment was fast arriving. The Bio Alert which Officer Manning called for was coming now, ready to swing into action.<br />
<br />
Manning stood by his Officer friend Jenson as the infection spread making visable changes. The young Officer of just twenty two years of age was sitting up as he was still in direct contact with George's spent cum.<br />
<br />
Head hanging low, chin pressed against a swelling chest, now vey Bovine ears hung to the sides of his head, they wiggled off and on. His head the bone structure was making thickening as skull squared into a block of pure Bovine like shape.<br />
<br />
Breathing in and out in heavy but slow movements, the rush of his breathing almost sounding as a Bull snorting. Indeed his face, lips and nostrils had merged making a most real head for a Hereford Bull.<br />
<br />
Fiddling with his changing hands, didgets merged as did those of Rick and Leslie to form a three fingers. Each finger ended in a dark brown horny lump which to all looked very much the part of a cloven hoof. Even Officer Jenson knew what his hands were fast becoming and as he watched it made him laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Murrah!&quot; came a sound from Jenson's mouth as he would hold up his changed hands now becoming hooves. Lips slapping, nostrils running streams of snot as tongue lolled out the side of his mouth he looked up at Manning.<br />
<br />
The Bio equipment being set up to handle the situation made for a realm of echoed noise within the walls of the old warehouse.<br />
<br />
Manning stood by talking, trying in his best mannered way to comfort his friend. Yet as minutes ticked into an hour, and hours had passed he was watching this man become an animal.<br />
<br />
Jenson took a deep breath making his shirt buttons pop off one by one. A struggle to remove his confining bullet proof vest made for much heated grunting till it too flew off.<br />
<br />
It was easy to see the growing muscles and hair making the man now to look like a Hereford animal. The groaning, and laughing the paranoia was beginning and with this the loss of rational thinking, it all had a reasonable pattern as Officer Manning watched.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are about ready for the infected man!&quot; came a broadcast over Manning's radio. He shuddered to think that those people outside already had forgot Jenson's name and would shortly think of him as a mere animal.<br />
<br />
A scramble and struggle made Manning turn to look at Jenson as the man kicked and shook off his trousers. Now short of his bulging jockey short he was naked to the world at large. naked but not as the red and white hairs of his soon to be Hereford breed was covering him over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we come in and retrieve the victim?&quot; came a call over the radio.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much left to retrieve at this point, what took you so long?&quot; replied an angry Manning.<br />
<br />
Then six men dressed in almost space suits came into the warehouse. As they approached Manning ans saw Jenson they stopped an conversed quietly.<br />
<br />
As two men went to work on drapping a plastic containment bag over Jenson the other four took hold of Manning. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not me you nitwits, its him!&quot; yelled Officer Manning.<br />
<br />
Manning turned his head half way around as the sting of an injection poked his neck. In a second he folded falling like Jenson to the cum covered floor.</p>
