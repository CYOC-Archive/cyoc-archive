<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After seeing the African savannah animals, it was time for Samantha and her family to leave the zoo.<br />
<br />
As they walked to the exits, the giant preteen noticed how she had to walk very slowly in order for her family to keep up.<br />
When she was 7’6 it was extremely noticeable, but at 10 feet tall it was impossible to ignore.<br />
<br />
All the way through, she was a beacon for attention to the other zoo guests, and some of the zoo animals themselves (which were the entire reason the guests came to the zoo in the first place…)<br />
<br />
Once again, due to her wish, she loved all of that.<br />
She was still hot, and she was even taller.<br />
<br />
And when passing through the exist gate, she bumped her head in it.<br />
“Ouch”<br />
“Honey, are you alright” her father asked from down bellow.<br />
“Yes” she replied with a little smile on her face. “I’m getting used to it”<br />
<br />
Bending through the gate and exiting the zoo, Samantha and her father parted from Diana, Chelsea and George, and went to their car.<br />
<br />
The car was even bigger than before, but the huge girl still had to squeeze inside it.<br />
As inconvenient as it was, it was amazing for her. Even in such a large vehicle, she was too big to fit inside comfortably. She loved that thought.<br />
<br />
The ride was fairly underwhelming. She was just crowded inside the car for some time as they returned home.<br />
<br />
But then a thought hit her.<br />
Because she was so huge and growing so quickly, her parents had to spend a fortune on her. She was ripping them out of money.<br />
<br />
Because of that, Samantha silently made a wish.<br />
“I wish my family was wealthy enough that my growth wouldn’t cause financial problems”<br />
She hoped that will be enough.<br />
She didn’t see any immediate changes.<br />
<br />
After the car ride was over though, Samantha noticed that the “home” she and her dad returned to wasn’t the same one they were in before.<br />
Behind an extremely large yard, there was an enormous house.<br />
<br />
She went to the door to the door, which appeared to stand at nine feet high, and waited for her slower father to get there and open it.<br />
Inside, she admired the place, as new memories came into her mind.<br />
<br />
Even before she started growing up, they had this huge house, with the bottom floor and highway at the top one having 15 foot high ceilings and the the rooms of the top floor having 9 foot high ones.<br />
When she passed 8 feet and got alarmingly close to the ceilings of the top floor, her parents made sure to renovate Samantha’s room, her toilet room and her bathroom to the same 15 foot height, in addition to making the doorframes 9 feet high.<br />
<br />
This meant that she currently had a lot of room to stand up in, and a lot of room to grow into.<br />
<br />
Walking around the house, Samantha admired how large it is and how it was changed to fit both the normal sized parents and their giant daughter.<br />
Upstairs, she noted how the doorknobs there were at a height of 5’6. A lot higher than normal to make it easier for her to use, but still low enough for her parents would also be able to use them.<br />
<br />
She then decided she to shower again.<br />
She went into her bathroom, removed her  clothes and looks at her naked glory in the full length mirror.<br />
<br />
Her face was still that of a beautiful young adult.<br />
If yesterday she was tall and skinny, she was even more extreme that day, though while she was proportionally thinner, she did get wider.<br />
Her breasts were proportionally smaller due to not growing with her, but they were still huge.<br />
“Well, puberty is still going, so they’ll probably return to that glory eventually” she told to herself.<br />
<br />
After finishing to admire herself, she took a shower, enjoying the flow of the water going all over her body.<br />
After that, she dried herself with a comically small towel and went to her room to dress, admiring how long her specially made clothes were.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, the rest of her day wasn’t that interesting. She admired how huge she was next to certain objects and next to her family, but otherwise it didn’t feel that extraordinary. Her mind was adapting to her memories of the situation, meaning that it didn’t feel like an entirely new experience.<br />
She watched TV, played on her phone and did other little actions to pass her time.<br />
<br />
During dinner with her parents, Samantha admired how it looked.<br />
They sat on very high chairs, but due to her extremely long legs, her feet still touched the floor.<br />
<br />
Despite the majority of her height coming from her legs, she still absolutely towered over her parents in a sitting position, which she adored.<br />
<br />
“Well honey, how was your visit to the zoo?” Her mother asked.<br />
“It was great mom!” She replied. “I saw I lot of cool animals”<br />
“You can argue that the animals were also interested in seeing her” her father joked. “She dwarfed them all!”<br />
“Yes, that was awesome!” she replied. She didn’t lie. She loved it.<br />
“It’s great to hear that you two had fun there” her mother said.<br />
<br />
After dinner, everyone stood out of the table and Samantha admired how she was nearly double her mother’s height.<br />
<br />
Some time later, she went upstairs, three steps at a time, and prepared to sleep.<br />
After brushing her teeth and going to the toilet, she went to her room and prepared to sleep. The clothes she wore after showering were basic and comfortable, so she stayed with them.<br />
<br />
After putting away the wishing ring on her counter, Samantha went to her bed, which was now bigger than any kind offered in the market, laid on her back, put on the carpet and went to sleep.</p>
