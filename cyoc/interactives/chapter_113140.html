<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s agent couldn&#39;t speed after Huck as he drove off, as doing so would only make him more of a target for law enforcement, which he&#39;d need to avoid in order to make his get away. He still privately cursed being distracted by a woman taking out her garbage but followed along at a respectable speed so as to attract little attention. The agent remained thankful that his target&#39;s truck, who the second agent thought was Harold Jenkins, didn&#39;t get far enough ahead that the agent couldn&#39;t follow him. The agent drove along behind him and saw the truck pull in to a small parking lot in front of what looked like a mobile home with a wooden sign that read &quot;Jenkins Construction&quot; on the front. Behind it was a fenced compound which had several huts and sheds that held either equipment or other tools and supplies, or potentially even the raw materials that would be needed for such company. The agent could even see some stacks of wooden boards in a shed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... he works for his father on days with no classes,&quot; the agent mused to himself after sending his text to the first agent, or at least to who he thought was the first agent, &quot;should have focused more on his work and less on someone else&#39;s girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the second agent drew his gun from his right hand and drove forward slowly as he approached the front of the building. He kept it low so that no one would see him raise his weapon until it was too late. In this, the agent remained successful, but his focus had left him blinded to whether or not he was already being followed or that certain areas were being monitored and being kept safe. Officers Ward and West, one a Bloodhound weredog and the other a German Shepard weredog, had been on duty in Moon Lake&#39;s only unmarked police cruiser and assigned to monitoring the agent. They had to follow the agent slowly so as not to alert the agent, but it still left agent with some freedom to keep moving forward. And so, the agent noted &quot;Harold Jenkins&quot; as he got out of his truck and moved toward the building and walked between his truck and another car that was there. He slowed down further to draw his gun and be ready to take the best aim possible.<br />
<br />
As he drove by he raised his gun and fired. The shot struck &quot;Harold Jenkins&quot; in the back and he fell forward onto the ground. He then hit the gas pedal to pull away when he heard a few gunshots, this time from behind him. The rounds shattered his back window and one went into the passenger seat while the other went into car&#39;s radio. The agent looked back into the rear view mirror and was surprised to see an officer on foot aiming his own side arm toward him, and had apparently already fired two shots. Further behind the officer on foot, he saw a black car pulling toward him. He remembered seeing the black car, but now it had a lone read light sitting on its top and was flashing. He was quick to realize that it was an unmarked cruiser.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; the second agent cursed and pulled away.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
For Huck, things happened quickly. He&#39;d just made it to the front of his truck when it felt like a werebull hit him in the back with a sledgehammer. It hurt and the pain left him barely able to notice the gunfire going on around him. He heard a car pull away at high speed while another car blaring a police siren soon followed. He couldn&#39;t move with it, as the round had gone into his back, through his right lung collapsing it, before coming out his chest. Huck could only lay face down and struggling to breathe. He was thankful that the bullet had missed his heart and that his left lung was still functioning.<br />
<br />
But while a were&#39;s ability to heal would be able to repair the damage to his right lung and the entrance and exit wounds, he would need the wounds to stop bleeding to give him the time to heal, even as he felt himself shifting into his Pomeranian weredog form, purely on reflex and enhance his recovery. And in the pain of being shot, the feeling of his feet destroying his work shoes didn&#39;t feel good either. The grown of his muzzle hurt slightly as his body was putting everything into trying to heal the wound. His skin itched as his fur grew out and covered him, especially under his clothing where he couldn&#39;t move to make it comfortable. There was also the added of issue of the fact that while transforming might help him heal faster, it wouldn&#39;t necessarily make the wound look better as his long fur could bend over into the entrance and exit wounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold buddy,&quot; a male voice said from above him, though Huck didn&#39;t have the strength to respond, &quot;this Officer West to Moon Lake Hospital. Send a bus, we have a wounded weredog, victim of a drive by... wound is serious and priority!&quot;<br />
<br />
Huck could barely blink and continued to struggle to breathe. He could soon feel hands putting pressure on his back. Whoever had arrived was trying to help him. He wanted to say something when the door opened and his secretary came out. Betty Timid was a Moon Lake normal, and had gone to school with Huck and he&#39;d found she was interested in many of the same things he was and proved quite adept at helping him with various projects. And despite being a normal woman, she did her best to work as hard as any man, were or normal, that he employed. Some times he wondered why she didn&#39;t take her skills to someone who could pay her better, but at times he wouldn&#39;t complain as she was a good friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;HUCK! OH-MY GOD, HUCK!&quot; Betty screamed in surprise and rushed forward, &quot;Oh Huck... don&#39;t die... don&#39;t die...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A girlfriend?&quot; Officer West asked.<br />
<br />
Huck felt weak but heard her say, &quot;I&#39;ve wanted to be...&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
While Officer West moved to give first aid and try to keep Huck stable until the ambulance could get there, Officer Ward kept pursuit on the fleeing second agent. He might need back up to secure the arrest, but he&#39;d need to keep close to him to ensure that this guy was even caught. He could keep &quot;hot pursuit&quot; for as long as he needed to, but he also knew that it&#39;d be best to keep the guy in Moon Lake. Thankfully though, after Officer West fired on him, the guy seemed to duck down, as if hiding behind the driver&#39;s seat to avoid taking more fire. It&#39;d reduce his visibility and limit how much he could control the car.<br />
<br />
That became apparent fairly quickly as the man pulled back onto the street. He&#39;d slowed and pulled almost off the street entirely to take his shot. This meat that the wheels on the right side were on the parking lot while the left was on the street. He needed to turn left slightly to get back onto the street, and from his hunkered down position, the agent had over-corrected and nearly went into the left lane before straightening out. This allowed Officer Ward to catch up, though, he also did his best to avoid any issue with ramming the guy&#39;s vehicle. So long as the agent remained on the present street there was no need to.<br />
<br />
While there where plenty of roads that connected Moon Lake to the outside world, they were rather limited and the present road that the agent was fleeing down was a dead end. The road ended in one of Moon Lake&#39;s spokes that came to firm end. The agent wouldn&#39;t be able to flee Moon Lake on the street he was on. He would run out of road, leaving Officer Ward to hold the guy off. Officer Ward was informed that backup was on its way, and stayed close enough behind the crook to keep him from getting enough of a lead to turn around but far enough back that he wouldn&#39;t be an easy target if the guy decided to make a stand. <br />
<br />
They went past a few small stores and shops before Officer Ward saw the dead end sign and the guard rail fast coming up. Officer Ward brought his car to a stop and watched. The agent had sped along, and tried to correct to make a quick turn around, and the initial attempt looked good, but the car he was in was designed for the turn and the momentum was enough to make the car slide and then roll. Officer Ward watched as the car landed on its side with a resounding crash with metal cracking and bending and the shattering of the rest of the car&#39;s windows as it landed. At this point, Officer Ward turned his car so that it was angled so that he would be able to use it as a shield of sorts. He put his car in park and climbed out while drawing his gun.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, you can&#39;t escape,&quot; Officer Ward yelled, &quot;climb out and show me your hands!&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Back outside of Jenkins Construction, Betty had brought out a blanket, normally kept in case a blizzard caught anyone in the office in the winter and helped Officer West wrap it around Huck. It was to serve to not only help curb the bleeding but help hide the fact that the weredog had transformed after being shot. Officer West noted that while Huck&#39;s breathing was weak, it was study. That was a good sign that Huck had been lucky enough to have not been shot through the heart and that the wound while hard was still such that a were&#39;s ability heal, what some doctors termed lycanthropic regeneration, would just be able to save his life, but Officer West wasn&#39;t a doctor there was still a lot that would need to be done medically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will he be okay?&quot; Betty asked nervously she looked down to Huck and stroking his head and fur, trying to assure him that she loved him in the only way she could think.<br />
<br />
Betty did her best try and keep things quiet on that front. She&#39;d been born a Moon Lake normal and couldn&#39;t remember when her family moved to the area. There were a fare number of her family that were weres and related to her through that common ancestor in her family tree, but she&#39;d never paid close enough attention to who that ancestor was. She&#39;d been raised more by her father who had inspired in her an interest in woodworking. It was in that lead her into wood-shop classes in high school and so on. It was there that she met Henry  &quot;Huck&quot; Jenkins Jr. By that time the boy had become a weredog to be his family were, but to Betty that didn&#39;t matter. She&#39;d gladly be a were if it meant being with him.<br />
<br />
However, Betty had also been fearful that asking Huck out would hurt what had been their platonic friendship and the finality of becoming a were made it such that she remained to nervous to actually ask him out. She worked with him and stayed as close as she could in the hopes that Huck might actually ask her, but while he&#39;d always been friendly, he&#39;d never asked her either. Now, though, with Huck shot and practically hanging on to life with a police officer doing his best to try and stop the bleeding, which had stained the blanket a bright scarlet, it had raised fears in her that Huck would die and she&#39;d never get the chance to tell him that she&#39;d loved him for years. It left her in a panic and when she spoke, it was to urge Huck not to die. She paid no attention to the two cop cars that drove past to reinforce Officer Ward in dealing with the second agent.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment,&quot; Officer West spoke, &quot;it&#39;s the best I can do to control the bleeding and hope he can heal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s got be something you can do!&quot; Betty urged.<br />
<br />
&quot;An ambulance is on the way and should be here soon,&quot; Officer West assured her, &quot;from there, they will be able to do more... stop the bleeding, get him any needed transfusions, and do what they need to save his life... or at least let him heal in relative comfort. And the odds of him making it are fairly good. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty simply kept stroking Huck&#39;s head and looked from him to Officer West and then to the street and continued to worry. Her worries didn&#39;t lessen until the ambulance appeared on the scene.</p>
