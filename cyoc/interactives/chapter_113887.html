<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Although nobody knew about it, Damon had rather... unusual sexual interests. He wasn&#39;t quite sure why but he&#39;s always been fascinated by women. Not just women as partners but women as those people who went through a completely (or so he thought) life experience. He found it fascinating that half of the human race for example went through the process of growing breasts (an entire new part of anatomy!) while the other half had no idea of how that felt.<br />
<br />
Naturally, he felt curious.<br />
<br />
With time his interests evolved and he began to get more and more interested in how little control women seemed to have over their role and their bodies. __You want smaller breasts? Well, too bad, you&#39;ll have to carry these because Mother Nature says so!__ __You want to be more assertive? Well, too bad, you&#39;ll be small and really turned on by dominance instead.__ And they just had to accept this.<br />
<br />
He was curious. And he wanted to know how it felt like.<br />
<br />
But his fetish was a strong one. And so to experience the feeling of not being able to help but be an object of male desire and a destination of male gaze, he had to turn into a woman. And he had to do it *for life*.<br />
<br />
He knew he would probably regret his wish. In fact, he knew that he would DEFINITELY regret parts of his wish, due to some special parts he added. But his desire was too strong and the sudden appearance of the magic lamp provided a perfect opportunity to make impossible happen. Without backsies.<br />
<br />
And so he rubbed the lamp, waited for the genie to pop out and started reading the product of several hours of typing:<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that everything I say between now and saying the word &#39;facade&#39; came true!&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt a stirring in his groin and he pulled out his hardening dick, as he did so many times before when working it to erotic fiction online.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two minutes after I finish reading this wish I shall pass out and and wake up five minutes later to a completely new life. In that new life I will be a 16 year old girl called Danielle. Danielle had a very minor car accident two weeks ago, which gave her amnesia, without any further medical repercussions. Thanks to that nobody will find it weird I don&#39;t remember anything from Danielle&#39;s life and have to learn everything from the scratch.&quot;<br />
<br />
He took a big breath and continued, his dick now at full post in his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though fairly pretty (what most med would call a 7.5 out of 10) Danielle is a late bloomer. Currently 4&#39;10 tall, Mother Nature won&#39;t be too generous about my future stature, letting me grow only one more inch, settling at 4&#39;11, with a petite build of a 20 inch waist and shoulders not much wider. My size two feet will have me struggle to find shoes in any but kids sections of shoe stores and no matter how much I work out I&#39;d only be able to open under a quarter of my jars. As a late bloomer, Danielle only got her first period six months ago and that&#39;s also when she started growing breasts. But even though late, puberty hit her hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon had to stop stroking his cock or otherwise he&#39;d explode. He wanted to keep that for the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;In only six months she grew into a C cup and at the point her life becomes mine, I&#39;d be in the middle of another slightly-painful growth spurt, ending up with me pleading my new mom to get me a new bra by day two of my life as Danielle. By the end of high school, despite my petite size, I&#39;d be the most top-heavy student there. The truth will be that although it will never be diagnosed, I&#39;d be suffering a mild case of macromastia, which will have my breasts continue growing until my early twenties, stopping one year after I reach the size...&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon paused briefly. Considered what he was about to say. Then continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;... one year after I reach the size which will make me regret wishing myself having to deal with my new chest. Though not big enough to cause me serious medical problems they will be too sizable for me to ever truly get used to them. Furthermore, despite their size they won&#39;t sag excessively and instead stay firm, jutting forward from my torso proudly. This will make them more attractive to men, although many will still consider them somewhat too disproportionally large compared to the rest of me. I will not understand this attraction though, because as soon as I become Danielle, I shall loose my sexual interest in breasts. I will still understand on a rational level that they are sexually appealing, but to me they will be just like to any other woman - two increasingly uncomfortable sacks of flesh stuck to my chest, making me into an object of a male sexual desire, whether I want it or not. On top of that I will also be unable to recall the details of my wish relating to my breasts, only being able to remember that I wished about them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon looked down on his dick breathing heavily. Even though he wasn&#39;t touching it, it was still rock hard. He knew that soon he wouldn&#39;t have it at all. He also knew he has already read enough of his wish so that even if he stopped now, he&#39;d get a pretty intense experience of womanhood. But that was NOT all he&#39;s written. He took started stroking his penis gently again and returned to reading page he just printed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though top-heavy, my chest will be by no means my only prominent feature. Today will be a day marking the start of one year of the development of my pelvis. I want my hips to get wide enough to alter my gait to make it impossible for me to run comfortably, even if my breasts were of manageable size. I want my butt to grow in proportion to it, soft and squishy, making me feel self conscious about its size, despite and because of its appeal to men.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was about as much as he had to say about his new looks. The cherry on top was the behavioral changes he was to unleash upon himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even though I will find women still attractive in principle. I will find my body respond strongly to the prospect of being objectified and dominated sexually by men. Although vaguely ignoreable at first, it will evolve into eventually me finding it hard to not give in to a dude wanting to have his way with me. Even though as clever as I am now, as Danielle, my grades in college will never exceed C&#39;s because of the sheer amount of time I&#39;d be spending on sex. Within the first week at college I will have sex with ten different guys and within my first year with over 150, orgasming at least once with every single one of them. Even despite the amounts of sex I&#39;d have I will never catch any STD&#39;s, get abused, or get any serious mental afflictions. I wish that eventually, I&#39;d settle into a loving and stable polyamorous relationship consisting of two men, two women and me, all involved with each other and living together. I will however be the most dominated one, unable to even find it in me to stand up to the more submissive of the two women. Because of that I will also end up being chosen as the child bearer for our family, carrying my first child before the age of 25, followed by a twin pregnancy, one set of triplets and then another one or two single children. Each of the pregnancies will leave my breasts even more bigger, although not much more. They will however enlarge my nipples significantly, leaving them 50% bigger each time I give birth. As Danielle, I will live a long and healthy life, but no matter how much I try, I will never be able to shake off, how different my life could have been as Damon and how much of a slave to my submissive womanhood I have become.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon was close to coming so he started to pump stronger. He didn&#39;t had to do it very much given how turned on reciting his fantasy mad him anyway. He felt his orgasm coming and as it did he screamed the magic end-of-wish word:<br />
<br />
&quot;FACADE!&quot;<br />
<br />
And then, just like the usual post-masturbation guilt came over him, he realized what a terrible mistake he&#39;s done. But he also knew it was too late as dizzyness overtook him. His body was getting ready to faint and have him wake up in a totally new life...</p>
