<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carefully grabbing her phone, Ophelia cautiously pressed one of her nails onto the touchscreen, hoping she wouldn&#39;t crack her screen. Thankfully though, her nail, to her surprise was somewhat soft and flexible, bending inward slightly as she pressed. It now made sense why Beldazarr said her nails would only be dangerous if she wanted them to be. As they are currently, she bet that she couldn&#39;t even use them to scratch off a lottery ticket. After a few attempts she was finally able to get the hang of controlling her nail&#39;s hardness. Feeling confident that she no longer was in danger of puncturing her screen, she began her second attempt at sending a text. However, right before she began typing, she recieved a phone call, from none other than her best friend, Heather.<br />
<br />
Answering the call, &quot;Hey Heather. I literally was just about to text you. Whats up?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, so who the fuck are you, and why do you have Ophelia&#39;s phone?&quot; Was what came back through the phone. <br />
<br />
For a moment, Ophelia was very confused, but then she understood. Heather would  obviously not be accustomed to her new voice. She probably thinking that some random girl is over with her at the moment and decided to answer her phone. She needed to clear this up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, its me. Oh, wait I mean, I am Ophelia. My voice is just different now, among a few other things. Sorry for the confusion.&quot;  She said, appologeticly, hoping that cleared everything up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, right. The guy who I have know since I was 5 suddenly woke up today, sounding like some horny girl? Not buying it. Look, I don&#39;t care what Ophelia does, I am not his mom, nor his girlfriend. So can you just hand him the phone?&quot; Heather asked, not really wanting to deal with some random one-night-stand girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;You dont seem to believe me, but I really am Ophelia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ophelia also noticed how natural calling herself Ophelia felt. She knew her nams only 20 minutes ago was Drake, but now that name felt completely foreign to her. It was a really odd feeling. Something she has known for her entire life suddenly felt out of place. Anyways, she needed to get through to Heather. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why not just come over here and see what I am talking about? We were going to meet up later anyways. And I have no plans until then. So if you don&#39;t either, then come over, I will prove it to you that I really am Ophelia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I was calling to ask him that anyways. I will be there in 2 minutes, so don&#39;t think of running away or hiding on me.&quot; And with that Heather hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, she gonna be pissed when she sees me. Oh well, better than her ignoring me. At least I will be able to show her I am not lying.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ophelia set her phone down on the bathroom counter. &quot;Wait, she said 2 minutes. That crazy bitch was already basically here. I know for a fact it takes her at least 10 minutes to drive here from her house. Well, at least she called. Now I can at least make the place a bit more decent.&quot; <br />
<br />
Grabbing the lamp again, &quot;Beldazarr, I&#39;m sorry to bother you but could you maybe help me out a bit more? I wish that I was properly clean and dressed, as well as my apartment was in a more presentable state.&quot; Ophelia wished, looking at the still cum coated bathroom, which smelled heavily of sweat and sex. That would have been a major issue if Heather had seen that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly Mistress, however may I suggest that you also wish for a few necessary items of which you are currently lacking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure. I wish I had the items you are suggesting I have.&quot; Ophelia states awkwardly. &quot;Out of curiosity, what are the items I am lacking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress currently is lacking a supply of the following:<br />
- general female hygiene products<br />
- a wardrobe suitable for a female anthro-dragon<br />
- feminine accessories, such as chokers, ear rings, and bracelets <br />
- an automatic milker, because even though you do not need one to extract your milk, having one is convenient for when you are not in the mood<br />
- a large refrigerator, dedicated only for the storage of your milk and eggs.<br />
- a new bed, more suired for your new body<br />
- lastly, a way to identify yourself legally as being the same Ophelia. It would be difficult if while out, your new identity caused an issue, such as being mistaken for identity theft.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, please do that Beldazarr. And thanks. You really helped me out this time.&quot; Ophelia said with a smile, as her first wish began to take effect. She was now wearing a custom short skirt, which was lengthened in the back to account for the raise her tail gave it, which allowed for the hem to appear level. She was also dressed with a pair of black, lacy string panties. Which she realized she was going to be the only kind ahe could wear since her longer legs and clawed feet would make putting normal ones on somewhat difficult. Unlike with her claw-like fingernails, her claw-like toenails were always hard, with only their sharpness being adjustable. She noticed however, that the strings rested fairly high on her hips, appearing a few inches above her skirt&#39;s waistband. <br />
<br />
She was currently barefoot, but noticed in the corner of her room, a pair of special kind of high heeled sandle boots appeared. Apparently, it could fit her foot, with her toenails sticking out the front, with the platform keeping them from scraping on the ground. Heel was very tall, which she guessed had to be at least 7&quot;. And the shaft looked to go all the way up to either just above her knee or to her mid thigh in height. The boots were entirely black too. &quot;Huh, those look like they would be fairly comfortable and are actually fairly sexy. Beldazarr has a good sense of style, everything so far is really cute and fitting.&quot; She thought to herself while grinning like an idiot, now just a bit excited to try them out later when she and Heather decide to leave. <br />
<br />
There were also a few other pairs of similar shapped heels, some were boots, a few were sandles, there was even a pair of wedges, but besides those everything else had a very thin stelleto heel,  all were at minimum 7&quot; heels, with one pair reaching 11&quot;. This pair would forced her onto her toenails. The thought if wearing them around while in public started making Ophelia a bit horny. Apparently these were special, &quot;indoor only&quot; heels. All were custom made for her. She noticed there was even a pair of soleless heels, which basically was just the heel with a few straps which would go half way up her calf. These were only 6&quot; tall, and seemed to be her go to pair, given that of all the others, besides the first pair of thigh highs, looked as if they bairly were ever used. Odd given she only became a girl today, but she figured Beldazarr was just making them look more natural.<br />
<br />
Shifting her focus once again back to her clothing, she found that her top was unsurprisingly custom made too. Her arms and shoulders were completely exposed, with the front tying behind her neck with the 2 strips of fabric holding up her uppermost breasts. Her front was designed in a way which gave her H-cups a generous amount of cleavage and a surprisingly decent amount of support, which was odd given its low v-neck shape. The &quot;v-neck portion&quot; ended right above her middle pair at a band, which wrapped around her torso. Below the band, was a form fitting material which wrapped entirely around her. The hem was rested only a few inches above her belly button, allowing her abs, and a sexy amount of underboob, to be displayed. The front, between her lower 2 pairs, had a cutout in it showing off her middle pair&#39;s underboob, and her bottom pair&#39;s cleavage. Her top also was black, with a sheer mesh material filling the cutout.<br />
<br />
Her room had just finished becomming spotlesd when Heather walked in through her front door, not even bothering to knock, obviously concerned and annoyed for some reason. The moment she saw Ophelia, starring down at her own tits while fondling them a bit, did her expression change greatly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, she is cute, and bigger than me too.&quot; Heather thought to herself. She never told Ophelia, but for a while now, she had felt like she wanted to date him seriously. And the sight of a girl who honestly was more attractive than her, in his appartment, had all but shattered that hope. Her pride also took a bit of a hit, seeing the girls chest. Heather knew Ophelia was into large boobs, and she was secretly prideful that her own F-cups were hard to compete with, even if they did hurt her shoulders sometimes and made running a hassle. <br />
<br />
&quot;So. Where is he?&quot; Asked Heather, sounding a bit defeated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Im right here. I am Ophelia. We have been best friends since we were 5.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The Ophelia I know is a man, not a anthro dragon girl. But if you say you are him, then prove it somehow.&quot; Reasoned Heather, a part of her actually hoping the girl was telling the truth. If this really was Ophelia, then she still could date him or rather her, even if she is now an unfairly cute girl, with a bigger chest and a sexy voice. Plus her having 4 extra boobs was cheating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hah, thats easy! Until we both turned 7, you were convinced I was a girl. You would even introduce me as one to others. And even when everyone said I was a boy, you didn&#39;t bdlieve them. You only realized you were wrong when you accidently saw my dick when my swimshorts fell off in your pool.&quot; Exclaimed Ophelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it. Stop it. Stop it, I get it. You&#39;re Ophelia. Just stop with the embarrassing memories. Your name is Ophelia. At 5 years old, I only have hever heard girls with that name. So obviously I would think you were messing with me.&quot; Heather cried out, now embarrassed remembering how she would insist Ophelia was a girl, and would dress him up in princess dresses, and such. He always complained at first, but eventually just went with along it since they ended up having fun anyways, and usually took them off after just a few minutes to play outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not my fault my mom convinced herself I would be born a girl, to the extent she had spent thousands on hand-made furniture with the name Ophelia engraved on it.&quot; It actually was no Ophelia but Drake. But since she worded her wish to officially be named Ophelia, the name was switched. Her mom&#39;s extreme love for dragons being replaced with her mom expecting a girl, but getting a boy.<br />
<br />
The two just stared at each other for a while. &quot;Soooooo.&quot; Heather said, trying to break the silence. However, both of them immediatly broke down into laughter. &quot;Alright, get over here&quot; heather said motioning for Ophelia to come closer.<br />
<br />
Ophelia, now very happy, jumped into Heather, knocking them both to the ground in a tackle, hugging her on the ground. Surprisingly, Ophelia was actually slightly shorter than Heather now. Heather, fully expecting the tackle, but not the force, caught Ophelia and immediatly was knocked down to the ground by the anthro-dragon girl&#39;s strength. It didn&#39;t hurt when she fell though. Ophelia had apparently used her wings to ease their fall. However, Heather didn&#39;t remember giving Ophelia permission to shove her face into her cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, what are you doing?&quot; Asked Heather, not really annoyed or upset at Ophelia&#39;s sudden aggressiveness. If anything, she was excited with her playfulness, hoping that meant Ophelia felt similarly about her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just something I have wanted to do for a while. And now I can, since I can let you do the same to me afterwards. You always said that I could as long as I had a pair for you to do the same with.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well then. That is quite the bold assumption of you girly, thinking that just because you now have tits, opens up a few doors for you. I will have you know it will cost you more than just letting me motorboat you to make up for it.&quot; Teased Heather playfully with a mischievous grin. &quot;I expect you to buy me an apology dinner later, and maybe let me spend the night, so I can explore more of you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Maybe I&#39;ll let you milk me too.&quot; Replied Ophelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Milk you? You&#39;re seriously lactating?&quot; Heather said now shocked with the sudden revelation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, all 6 need to be emptied daily. And I only want someone I can trust doing so.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but then I am going to need a new title.&quot; Said Heather, holding up Ophelia&#39;s head with her hand under her chin. Both were now looking into each other&#39;s eyes. &quot;Make me your girlfriend, then I will gladly milk you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ophelia didnt aswer right away, still starring at Heather, now out of disbelief. But once she understood that Heather&#39;s comment about becomming her girlfriend was serious, she shot out her significantly longer tongue, slipped it into Heather&#39;s mouth, hooked her jaw, and pulled her in close to kiss her. <br />
<br />
Obviously not expecting the sudden french kiss nor a tongue which easily spanned the distance of over a foot between their lips, to pull her mouth into Ophelia&#39;s kiss, caused Heather&#39;s eyes to widen in suprise. However, once the kiss started she quickly understood that Ophelia had accepted her confession. <br />
<br />
Now ecstatic, Heather pulled her new girlfriend who was laying down on top of her, up closer to her head, while secretly sliding both of her hands down Ophelia&#39;s skirt, squeezing her new lover&#39;s impeccable ass. Ophelia, feeling Heather&#39;s hands rhythmically squeezing her ass, slid her own hands under Heathers top. She delicately unhooked Heathers bra, thankful that she wore a front clasp today. Heather felt her bra lossen, but didnt pay it much attention. She knew her girlfriend&#39;s hands would surely make for a suitable replacement. <br />
<br />
As this continued, Ophelia&#39;s tail, which normally was loosely hanging behind her, had been flicking back and forth in time with Heather&#39;s squeezing. Left. Right. Left. Right. By now Ophelia was entirely nake. And except for Heather&#39;s high heeled boots, leggings, panties, and bra, which was still hanging loosly from her arms, Heather had begun to lose her clothing too. Ophelia still on top, and both still making out while squeezing each other&#39;s soft areas.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Heather firmly cupped both of Ophelia&#39;s asscheeks at once, which caused a moan to slip from Ophelia&#39;s lips, interrupting their kiss. Opening her eyes a d looking at Heather, Ophelia immediately understood, and began flapping her wings, lifting the two of them up. <br />
<br />
As they rose off the ground, Ophelia wrapped her legs tightly around Heather&#39;s body, as well as doing the same with her arms. Heather still held Ophelia&#39;s ass tightly, letting the girl&#39;s wings pull both of them up off of the floor. Once they were high enough, Heather swong her feet underneath them, now standing up. Ophelia stopped flapping her wings to let Heather carry her to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Once in the bed room, Heather turned around so that her back faced the now king sized bed and jumped backwards landing softly but tossing Ophelia up so she landed straddling her head. Now in perfect position, Heather began to eat out her girlfriend. Ophelia couldn&#39;t suppress her moans as she slowly used her tail to get into Heathers panties, and puahed her way into her wet pussy. <br />
<br />
What Heather didn&#39;t know though is that when Ophelia would orgasm, a lot of cum would squirt out of her. To call her a squirter was an understatement. So when Ophelia finally reached her limit, Heather found herself completely drenched. The bed was completely soaked too. Heather had tried her best to drink as much as she could, but it was just too much for her mouth to handle all at once. <br />
<br />
Quickly pushing Ophelia off of her, while coughing, Heather raised her head to catch her breath. &quot;Holy fuck, was that seriously all just cum? You didn&#39;t piss on me did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I forgot to mention that I do that now. And no, I wouldn&#39;t dare pee on you. Im not that depraved. Well. Unless you want me to, then maybe I would become that depraved. But I swear, only if you asked me to do it to you would I even consider peeing in your mouth. A d don&#39;t even think about asking me to do any scat play. That stuff is really gross.&quot; Said Ophelia, now with a cute pout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I believe you. But damn girl, that seriously is a lot of cum.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, you should have seen the bathroom. It was all over the walls too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess we are going to need some plastic sheet covers if this pussy keeps squirting like a fire hose.&quot; Joked Heather while she slid 2 fingers into Ophelia&#39;s still dripping pussy. Ophelia moaned loudly once and burried her head in Heathers chest, her mind going blank from pleasure. &quot;Guess I found your spot.&quot; Ophelia, now moaning with every exhale, could only nod her head, quickly on her way to another orgasm.</p>
