<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen looked at the clock – her time was almost up. Every time she tried to say one or the other, though, she caught herself beforehand, a new drawback to each option inconveniently paralyzing her. She stammered helplessly, feeling the seconds pass.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, time's up. Looks like you get both,” Kyle said. “Don't worry, this won't be too horrible. For your transformation, you're going to lose your head and neck, but where your neck was will be a vagina. You'll still be able to see, hear, and talk and all that, just not through physical means. On command, your viewpoint can shift between where your head would be and your crotch. And you won't need to eat, per se – you'll feed on the sexual pleasure of others, like a succubus – don't worry, you won't be injuring anyone by doing so. You'll only need to feed about twice a week, but you'll want to do more than that, I'm sure. Also, when you cause someone to orgasm, you'll be able to freely transform them mentally and physically, with few limits- oh, and you'll now feel overwhelming attraction for females.<br />
<br />
“Next, for your dare, this will help you sustain yourself. I dare you to transform everyone you have sex with from now on into females subservient to you. They can have whatever features you want, just so long as they're ultimately women. You don't need to transform anyone you already have, of course. If you avoid having sex altogether, though, a week from today, at this time, you will have sex with the next person you see, after which they will become like you. Ah, and nobody's gonna find any of this abnormal, okay?<br />
<br />
“Good luck.” A click.<br />
<br />
What the hell, Jen wondered as she hung up the phone. What kind of perverted-<br />
<br />
She didn't get to finish the thought. Her head felt really weird, as though it was shrinking or melting away. By the time she reached her hand to feel it, though, it was already gone. She watched as her hand went in front of what ought to have been her face... and went right through it onto her shoulders. And on her shoulders, right where she'd had a neck just a minute ago, there was a slimy cleft which sent shudders of pleasure throughout her body.<br />
<br />
She needed a mirror.<br />
<br />
Panicking, Jen raced to her room and looked in her mirror. Sure enough, her reflection was headless, a blankness staring back from her line of sight. She leaned in closer to examine her shoulders. As he'd said, there was now a vagina where her neck had been, its clitoris pointing to the front of her body. Jen was surprised to see a urethra there (what would come out of it?), and wondered how deep the vagina was, hoping there wasn't a fertile womb attached.<br />
<br />
How could she live like this? From what that dickhead Kyle had said, she wouldn't have problems from being headless or need food in a human sense, instead feeding by having sex with people – who she'd then turn into lesbian sex slaves, or just about. Nobody would think her strange, either, but...<br />
<br />
Despite her shock, Jen found her apprehension being replaced by lustful curiosity. She found her disembodied gaze examining, her hands roaming over her sex machine body. That “overwhelming attraction to women” thing was clearly taking hold.<br />
<br />
Thinking back, lust having overridden panic and logic, Kyle had also said that she could change her point of view to her original pussy. She imagined the view from between her legs, and then she was staring at the sink cupboard. Below her were her crotch and legs, above was her torso. Gingerly, she moved her right hand to her lower pussy, lightly stroking it. Her lips twitched immediately, and her clit poked out somewhat painfully. It felt incredible! Jen realized that the feelings were affected by the proximity – her crotch felt like her nervous center, thus receiving the strongest, most direct sensations. Shifting PoV back to her “head,” she guided her left hand to her shoulder-pussy and gave that a feel. Again, the pleasure was phenomenal. As perverted and strange this was, it was kind of a blessing in disguise. <br />
<br />
Then, Jen had an idea. She looked around and found a small mirror, which she propped up on the floor. She then undressed and sat back down so that her crotch was in front of the mirror. Then, she shifted her viewpoint to her crotch, seeing her pussy in the mirror. She brought her hands down, opening her lower lips for a better view. She tried flexing her vaginal muscles and her clit, reveling in the sensations and completely aroused at her own vagina, which had never before looked so appealing. She needed to finish herself off, Jen resolved, stroking her lower lips and mashing her clit against her thumb. Her muscles tensed and her body contorted wildly as she came with the force of a combined month's orgasms, girlcum oozing from her slit. Jen realized that her upper pussy must have come too, from the feel of it; a quick feel of sopping shoulders confirmed this.<br />
<br />
No longer worried about her freakish body, Jen's next thoughts were whether she was going to get some sex servants or just masturbate all day.</p>
