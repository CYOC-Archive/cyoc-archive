<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You integrated quickly into the daily life of the hospital, soon becoming everyone&#39;s favorite nurse. Your kind smile and commitment to your patients was unparalleled, and soon all the doctors  were pulling whatever strings they could, doing anything to get you to their departments even for a day. But you didn&#39;t mind, by moving all around the hospital you could secretly spread out your blessing to anyone in need. The hospital supervisor was the only one who knew of your powers, and you wanted to keep it that way. Besides, it would be unfair for the doctors who studied for years to just simply heal all their patients with a touch. So you were careful, only giving a small spark to everyone, making sure that they would survive whatever ailments they were suffering from.<br />
<br />
But while you were holding back, Agatha Steele was anything but. She worked like a woman possessed. Management duties, paperwork, expansion plans, nothing seemed to satiate her, and oftentimes you saw her running all around the hospital, working as a nurse and even a doctor, utilizing her decades of experience and multiple doctorates. No one seemed to question why their supervisor was now back in her twenties and doing the work of twenty. Another useful facet of your powers.<br />
But even with her humongous workload she showed no signs of slowing down, demanding more and more to do. It was like a nuclear reactor has flared to life inside of her, compensating for the years she spent sitting in her office, fueling her with boundless energy she was desperate to use up. And she couldn&#39;t be happier about it. You were very pleased with yourself, especially as Agatha insisted on treating you to tea almost daily.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
It was a Sunday night, and the hospital was practically empty. But Mrs. Steele still patrolled the halls, checking in on every patient and saw them sleeping soundly. She smiled. The hospital had become the country&#39;s finest since Vera&#39;s hiring and her rejuvenation. Still she could feel a ball of warmth in her chest, radiating as a reminder of that wonderful day they met. Pleased, she finally locked her office and prepared to leave, saying goodbye to the night guards and nurses.<br />
<br />
But as she was walking towards her car, she spotted a van on the parking lot. There were people crowding around it, dressed in dark hoodies and hauling boxes in the dead of night. Looking around, she noticed more people coming out of a side door, one that was located suspiciously close to their storerooms...<br />
<br />
She sighed. Just her luck to encounter criminals.<br />
<br />
But Agatha Steele was not one to back down from ruffians, and so she began pacing towards the van, her heels clacking on the pavement as she advanced, not even trying to hide her approach. The figures soon spotted her and stopped what they were doing, muttering amongst themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suggest you stop whatever you think you are doing. Whatever you&#39;re staling, patients need it more than you do. And believe me, we don&#39;t take kindly to thieves sabotaging our efforts at saving lives.&quot; She stated forcefully, confronting the group. All men, and vastly outnumbering her. But she didn&#39;t back down. This was her hospital, and she&#39;d be damned if she let them do as they pleased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut the fuck up, whore! These drugs are ours! They&#39;ll fetch a nice price. Give us a moment till we&#39;re loaded and THEN you can get to work.&quot; One of the thugs shots back. His comrades burst out laughing, and Agatha felt a blush creeping to her face as she suddenly became aware of her short skirt, stockings and cleavage-baring blouse. Sure, it wasn&#39;t up to dress code, but ever since her transformation she&#39;d vowed to never wear stuffy clothes ever again. Showing a little skin felt liberating after suffering as an old lady all those years. And the men certainly weren&#39;t complaining.<br />
<br />
She regained her composure, and pulled out her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m calling the police. Stay put and the night guards will accompany you till their arrival.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her words caused an uproar, as the men began scrambling, panicking at the prospect of getting caught. Their reaction amused her.<br />
<br />
Until one of them pulled out a gun.<br />
<br />
BANG!<br />
<br />
Time seemed to slow down as Mrs Steele was shot in the chest. The warmth in her chest was pulsating rapidly. What she didn&#39;t know was that it was in fact a fragment of your power, left behind since her rejuvenation as it encountered a genetic defect in her body. The spark had spent all these weeks repairing it, and now, with all her instincts flaring at once, it finally succeeded, releasing the lock on a curious mutation she&#39;d had since birth.<br />
<br />
CLINK!<br />
<br />
The sound of the bullet impacting something metallic echoed across the parking lot. Agatha held her breath, expecting the pain. But it never came. Slowly, she looked down.<br />
There it was, the bullet, squished in between her breasts, something silvery on her skin having stopped it. It looked almost like... metal?<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t have time to think as the metal began to spread, covering more and more of her skin in seconds as her cells hardened, turning into a different material altogether. Her breasts were engulfed, becoming impenetrable but remaining just as soft and bouncy. Same thing happened with the rest of her body, her toned muscles and abs becoming immortalized in the metallic exterior but moving and working just like their organic counterparts. But the change wasn&#39;t skin deep, as her internal organs shifted too, entirely eliminating her need to eat, drink or sleep. Even her ovaries hardened into steely balls, the dormant eggs within them inheriting her genetic evolution as the change finished, coating her entire body in living metal, finishing off by turning her hair into a solid, metallic structure.<br />
<br />
She opened her eyes, now smooth steel orbs. The thugs were looking at her in bewilderment, taking in her new body. She admired her new self, feeling her invulnerability. She grinned. This would even things out.<br />
<br />
Turning her attention back to the thieves, she leapt forward, bouncing her prey like a tiger, her heels getting absolutely demolished as her feet dug into the pavement. Her metallic form was supremely strong, agile and tough, easily taking down the helpless goons.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The fight was over, and Agatha stood there, catching her breath next to the unconscious thieves. Not that she needed to breathe anymore. Like this, she felt that she could survive the crushing pressure of the ocean depths, or the void of space. The thought made her giddy. So much power was contained within her body now. She couldn&#39;t wait to put it to good use.<br />
<br />
But she sure couldn&#39;t be seen like this, right? What would the others think? Would they call her a freak?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I wonder...&quot; she thought to herself. In her chest, where the glow had been before, now was an empty coldness. She closed her eyes and focused her mind on it, letting her consciousness drift towards that void.<br />
<br />
She could feel it working, the cold metal receding, the flow of blood restarting in her body as her transformation was reversed. The emptiness filled up again, not with the same glowing energy, but with... completeness. And she felt that she could do this again, as many times as necessary. But she was in no rush. Being an unstoppable wrecking ball of a woman was great, sure, but it didn&#39;t compare to the warmth and feeling of organic existence.</p>
<hr/><h3>
She smiled to herself as she dialed the cops. What would Vera think of this?</h3>
