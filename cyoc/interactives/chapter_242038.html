<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After thinking for a bit, you answered Brooke, &quot;Okay, we&#39;ll get you more sisters.&quot; You then let go of the ring, leaving it back on your finger. &quot;Thank you, Master,&quot; Brooke responds. &quot;Call me by my name, and not &#39;Master,&#39;&quot; you command her. She gives you a frown, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Master, the ring will not let me call you by your name. I can only call you Master, no matter what.&quot; &quot;I see. Well then, Brooke, put on some fitting clothes. We&#39;re going to eat out for lunch,&quot; you command Brooke. After her &quot;Yes Master,&quot; Brooke walks over to the bedroom you guys share, and you start putting on shoes. When you are all ready, Brooke walks back wearing one of her bigger dresses, a pink polka dot one, which now fits herself well, with some basic pink slippers. &quot;Am I fitting well, Master?&quot; &quot;Yes Brooke, now follow me,&quot; you command her more as an actual slave, to which Brooke responds, &quot;Yes Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you and Brooke get out of your house and go into your car, you decide to drive into one of the best places to use your ring, Hooters. As you drive over to a good-rated Hooters, you and Brooke go in during a lunch rush. After some amount of waiting, your next victim appeared to take you over to your seat. A woman, slightly smaller than Brooke, who has an amazing ass and thighs that matches the orange shorts well with her light tan. She also had a good pair of breasts with the iconic shirt, but the ass was selling you for her. Having nice natural blonde hair, with some highlights of blue, some pretty blue eyes, some nice mascara, and some nice red lips, your waitress brings you over to a small booth for you and Brooke. Pulling out her small clipboard, she introduces herself with a cheeky mood, &quot;Hello my name is Destiny, I&#39;ll be serving you guys today, can I get you two something to drink?&quot; You answer with your drink. Brooke asks you permission to choose a drink, and after giving her permission to get what she wants, she asks for water.<br />
<br />
After Destiny leaves to get your drinks, you look at Brooke, knowing you can&#39;t make conversation without her talking to you like a slave, then you look down to the menu to think of what you will eat for lunch. After a few minutes, Destiny comes back with your drink and water. &quot;Alright, are you two ready?&quot; Destiny asks with a cute giggle at the end. &quot;Yes, actually,&quot; you answer, and then give Destiny your order. After permitting Brooke again to get what she would like to eat, Brooke asks for a grilled chicken garden salad. After writing down the food, Destiny giggles again, &quot;Alright I&#39;ll get your food as soon as I can,&quot; and then leaves. Looking around a bit more, while sipping on your drink, a part of you couldn&#39;t wait to catch this woman as a new slave for your needs. But another part of you felt pretty bad, for even owning a woman, two women as slaves to satisfy your ring through its craving of your lust. But Brooke did ask for more sisters, she didn&#39;t want to be alone only serving you. You were just thinking too much about all of this.<br />
<br />
Some time passes by, and Destiny shows back with the food that you ordered. &quot;Enjoy yourselves!&quot; she smiles and walks back. You just want to claim her now, but your hunger is speaking louder, so you eat your food, but Brooke can only stare at her salad. With a sigh, you permitted Brooke to eat her salad and drink the water she didn&#39;t even touch. &quot;I apologize for annoying you, Master,&quot; Brooke responds. You forgive her, and as more time goes back, as you finish your food, Destiny comes back. &quot;Are you guys doing alright?&quot; she asks with the same smile. You answer, &quot;Yes of course, of course. Check please!&quot; &quot;Alrighty! I&#39;ll be right back!&quot; Destiny responds, walking back. You pulled out the money needed to cover your price, with some extra cash. Shortly later, Destiny walks back and gives you your total. You give her your money and touch Destiny&#39;s hand that was grabbing your money with your ring hand. &quot;I&#39;ll give you your change...&quot; Destiny paused for a moment, fighting something that was taking her in. But only for a mere couple of seconds, did Destiny finish her sentence, &quot;...my Master.&quot; &quot;Good!&quot; you smile back at Destiny, &quot;Now tell me your full name.&quot; &quot;Destiny Rose Banks, my Master. But I now identify as slave number two,&quot; Destiny answers with the giggle she gave earlier. &quot;Brooke,&quot; you ask her, &quot;will you accept Destiny as your sister?&quot; Brooke responds, &quot;I will accept anyone who loves you with their all as my sister.&quot; &quot;Destiny,&quot; you ask your new, second slave, &quot;will you accept Brooke as your slave partner?&quot; Destiny giggles a little, &quot;I will accept and love anyone who gives you all of them second-in-line to you, my Master.&quot; <br />
<br />
You smile at Destiny, &quot;Good, now Destiny, you will take our money, put the leftover change in your bra, and then promptly quit right now and sit next to us.&quot; Destiny answers, &quot;Okay my Master!&quot; with her smile and walks back. Now talking to Brooke, you say, &quot;Congratulations Brooke, you now have a sister.&quot; &quot;Thank you, Master,&quot; Brooke smiles, &quot;I will love her second to you, I hope we form a loving bond over to serve you, Master.&quot; After some time, Destiny comes back, and you scoot over for Destiny to sit next to you, with a warming smile she uses for her customers. &quot;So,&quot; Brooke starts to talk on her own, to someone other than you, &quot;how was it Two, my sister?&quot; Destiny responds with a light giggle, &quot;Well, it went really well! I have worked here for a couple of years, but the place already has enough waitresses to release me.&quot; &quot;So Destiny,&quot; you look in her direction, to her looking back to you with her smile, &quot;what is your life story?&quot;<br />
<br />
Destiny takes a second to think, before answering back, &quot;Okay, so I was Destiny Banks, now slave number two, and I am twenty-six! I grew up an average life, having a good enough pay to live a suburban life. My mom and dad work under a bank, as my old name implied duh!&quot; Destiny laughs for a bit, before getting back her composure, &quot;It was good enough for a good childhood, but I was wanting more. So starting in my late school years, I would start getting good money from all of me, and I would use it for good perfume and good looks, getting me more money! I worked for a stripper place, and now working here for somebody to give me good tips! Or, uhm, used to, before quitting just now, haha.&quot; &quot;So you like getting attention Destiny?&quot; you ask her, touching her left cheek and feeling her smooth face. &quot;Yeah of course! A girl like me liked to fish out the men for the good life silly.&quot; &quot;And how do you feel now?&quot; you ask her, still hand on her, now under her jaw. Destiny answers with a smile only for you, &quot;Well, now I just want you. I used to love the attention of all boys, but now I only want you to love and admire me. When looking at you, you make me feel something, something more satisfying than anything I have ever felt in my whole life, and I want to continue experiencing that satisfaction. I see One was able to experience that before me, and now I want more women, or &#39;sisters&#39; according to One, to join us two, to experience your love and satisfaction of serving you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smiling back at her, you talk back to Destiny, &quot;Well I love having you as my number two slave Destiny. You&#39;re such an adorable and funny slave.&quot; Destiny grabs her hands around your arms, saying &quot;Thank you, my Master!&quot; &quot;Now I wanna grab my change back,&quot; you say, as you get inside Destiny&#39;s bra, and grab out the leftover change. &quot;Of course!&quot; Destiny smiles back, &quot;What&#39;s yours is yours, on me or not.&quot; After grabbing all the change she had in her bra, touching some of Destiny&#39;s breasts a bit during the grabs, you decide to stand up, and Destiny moves aside for you to move out. After going out of the booth, you make your first group command, &quot;Brooke, Destiny, let&#39;s head out!&quot; In unison, they both said, &quot;Yes, (my) Master.&quot;</p>
