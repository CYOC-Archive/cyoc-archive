<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, Ty was still struggling to remember. She was sure she had seen a book like that before... a book like...<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a spellbook?&quot; Ty asked abruptly once the doors had closed behind her friend and the Elf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm?&quot; Luma glanced at her, momentarily bemused, then realised what her slave meant. &quot;Oh, the Tome of Change? Yes; and it is said to whisper to those who hold it. Telling the secrets of this world -- for it can do more than just defeat the Witch Queen. It contains spells that can reshape the world itself to the user&#39;s whim. It can lift the curse cast by the conclave. It could even unite the Five Lands to other worlds -- such as Earth...&quot;<br />
<br />
She trailed off, her gaze becoming distant again. &quot;The one who opened it would essentially, be the <i>true</i> &#39;god&#39; of this world and any other they chose to conquer. The Witch Queen wants it most desperately... and I...&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed, and refocused on Ty. &quot;I suppose it is enough for me that it is not in her hands, and things continue as they are. Why do you ask, pet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I...&quot; Ty frowned again, trying hard to recall. &quot;I think I may have seen it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt Luma stiffen. &quot;<i>No.</i>&quot; Luma licked her lips, and through their link Ty could feel a sudden swell of... of <i>desire,</i> mixed with fear. &quot;It&#39;s not...&quot; The Mistress lifted her hands, forcing her slave to meet her gaze again. &quot;Is it possible, slave? Where would <i>you</i> have seen it!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t lie to you, Mistress!&quot; Ty protested, feeling hurt that Luma didn&#39;t readily believe her. The larger vixen took a breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not. Of course not, my pet... But this news is... is too good to be true! I had resigned myself to this life -- a life good enough; but with the Tome I could...&quot; Her eyes sparkled, and Ty felt the magic wake in her, and her libido rise and entwine with the newly roused lust for power. &quot;I would no longer have to fear another -- I could <i>destroy</i> the Witch Queen! I could -- I could return to Earth! Create a new world of sex and whoredom!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! -- oh Mistress!&quot; Ty felt overwhelmed, smiling eagerly to see how excited she had made her owner. &quot;That would be wonderful!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So tell me slave -- <i>where</i> did you think you saw the Tome!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After we defeated the witch. We were searching her house for... for something to cure our friends...&quot; She grimaced, thinking how unfortunate Aaron and Eric had been with their changes. In time -- if Mistress was right -- they could give them forms that were truly alluring. &quot;I... I&#39;m not <i>sure...</i> but Jackie said she saw Kelly take a book from the witch&#39;s library like that. And later I saw her in one of the wagons, looking at a book bound in chains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Luma exploded in laughter. &quot;That two-penny hag had the Tome this whole time!? Well put me in heat! But... hmmm...&quot; She became thoughtful. &quot;Did you get a good look at it, pet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... no. And neither did Jackie.&quot; Ty&#39;s heart fell as she realised where Luma was leading.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it might <i>not</i> have been the Tome of Change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... maybe not Mistress.&quot; Ty looked down, disappointed in herself for not being able to confirm it. <i>We were so close to helping Mistress win and going home...</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Then again... it <i>might</i> have been. Nobody of importance really took the Stone Witch seriously -- we just let her amuse herself with the stupider heroes. It&#39;s <i>possible</i> she found it, somewhere, and was searching for the keys or trying to find a way to circumvent the seal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luma shook her head. &quot;No matter. I can&#39;t take the chance that it falls into the Witch Queen&#39;s hands -- she would be all powerful, and it would be the end for me and everything I&#39;ve built. You, too, pet. On the other hand... if <i>I</i> got it...&quot; Her cock slid up again as a wicked grin curled her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>You</i> would be all-powerful!&quot; Ty threw her arms happily around her Mistress. Luma laughed, hugging her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes pet!&quot; Luma groaned as her cock was squeezed between their heated bodies, then growled in passion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m too excited. I need to <i>empty</i> myself so I can <i>think!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Ty found herself face-down on the couch, Luma moving into position atop her. &quot;Up, slave!&quot; she commanded, tugging on Ty&#39;s tail. The concubine quickly assented, her mind awash with the feel of Luma&#39;s need to cum and her intoxicating scent. She braced her arms on the armrest, and lifted her ass high.<br />
<br />
Luma was on her in seconds, furiously thrusting into her, intense and rough, lost in a mix of fantasy and fear about the Tome and what it meant. Scarce five minutes and her knot had locked them together, and she was pumping even more seed into the already bred slave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rrrrgh,&quot; she snarled. &quot;It&#39;s not enough... Slaves!&quot; She slid off the couch, standing erect with Ty still speared on her firing shaft, Mistress&#39; tails enwrapping the slave fox to turn her about again. Ty threw her own twitching legs and arms around her Mistress as she whimpered and warbled in mind-melting sensation. The pressure building in her; the knot wrenching painfully at her vaginal ring; Luma&#39;s tails pumping her around the herm&#39;s cock like an onahole.<br />
<br />
Ty scarce heard the words as the Mistress muttered a spell; but she smelt the milk as Luma&#39;s nipples swelled out and beaded with white gold. As Ty tried incoherently to express her pleasure and beg for more, the Mistress reached her arms out towards the two human girls approaching at her command.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suckle me!&quot; she commanded; and crushed their faces into her tits. With eager abandon they obeyed, their lips closing around her fonts as their hands worshipfully caressed the smooth flow of fat and muscle across her abdomen and rear.<br />
<br />
When Luma had said &quot;empty&quot; Ty had not realised how much the herm still had left to give. But as the vixen yowled in final release, Ty felt shot after shot after <i>shot</i> of heavy semen fire into her depths. She screamed her own orgasm into Luma&#39;s cleavage, her mind in splinters of variegated happiness -- she feared that she might burst, literally, but who cared if her life was consumed by the virility flooding her?<br />
<br />
Several minutes later, Luma collapsed back on her throne, her tails lifting Ty from her thoroughly spent cock. Ty fell limply alongside her, cradling her belly with awe. It was taut, swollen even, with at least a quart of fox seed, despite the stream trickling from her legs now that Luma&#39;s male plug had been removed. <br />
<br />
Glancing dazedly around, she saw the humans in like predicament, fallen back on their butts, milk dripping from their lips, their bellies rounded from the load of Luma&#39;s breasts. Fluid spilled from their cunnies, too; though it was all their own. Their Mistress&#39; release mingling with her aphrodisiac milk was enough to drive them over the edge.<br />
<br />
After several minutes of collective panting, Luma spoke again. &quot;Now... now that I&#39;ve taken the edge off... I can decide what to do.&quot;</p>
