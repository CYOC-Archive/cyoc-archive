<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John could see Scott walking over to him, he seemed to be walking with quite a purpose. He glanced him up and down, Scott’s frame was quite stocky but he was no more than 5 foot six, a small belly showed underneath his red hoody. Scott’s cut off jeans had rips in them from boarding, and one of his blonde hairy knees had a small cut from the fall before.
<br><br>
“Hey, er who are you?” Scott glazed over in-front of John, his mind being overwhelmed.
<br><br>
“I’m John, hey look where am I exactly as I really need to get home to pick some things up,” John  scrubbed his head with the palms of his hand as he tried to clear it up; before noticing that the youngish man in front of him simply hadn’t said anything yet. Then John noticed that his new friend had started to breathe a lot heavier than before, and that he seemed to be almost shaking.  John could smell Scott’s sweat pouring out of his body, he had already had a slight odour about him from the exercise but now it was like a stench. 
<br><br>
“Hey... yeah so you didn’t tell me who you were,” Scott grunted a little bit as John began to notice his head was clearing up. He could finally see Scott’s face clearly, it was a little pudgy but cute and covered in a thin wiry five-o-clock shadow. His blonde hair gently hid his green eyes, though he noticed that Scott’s pupils had grown to a huge proportion.
<br><br>
“Would you like a drink?” John smiled at Scott, and Scott just nodded vacantly as John handed him the last beta vial. Scott popped off the cap, and John quickly hurried both him and Scott in a nearby desolate car park. After all John didn’t want to any of those other skaters to see what was happening to their friend. Little did John know that none of them were actually watching him at all, but he would rather be safe than sorry.
<br><br>
The pair just made it into the carpark when John noticed that Scott was getting heavier to drag behind him, soon John had to stop as he could no longer pull the weight of Scott. He turned in glee to see what transformation would become his last beta, letting go of Scott’s hand as he span on his heels to face him.
<br><br>
What John found was weird, Scott hadn’t seemed to of changed one bit and looked no different to when they’d first met.
<br><br><br><br>
Scott felt extremely strange, he could feel his body getting heavier and soon began to think that he didn’t actually have the weight to hold himself up. His short muscular legs were starting to buckle under an invisible  pressure as he could feel something welling up inside of him. It felt as if his little round stomach, which was a genetic trait in the males of his family was growing huge... but from the inside. His mind was overwhelmed with an animalistic urge, he needed to be near this guy he just met but didn’t understand why. He soon began to forget about the park as he could feel his posture changing. The view at his eyelevel was becoming lower and lower, soon only just staring at John’s crotch (which was sharply becoming erect from sheer anticipation).<br><br> Scott’s tussled hair was soon starting to grow a little bit longer, as he could feel something in his mouth re-arranging, it felt as if his teeth were going to fall out as his face elongated a little bit into a sort of muzzle. Suddenly  the buckle on his belt popped and Scott let out a massive sigh as an almost beer gut style stomach poked out from underneath his hooded top and spilled over his cut offs.  The gut started to expand a little more as Scott’s legs started to bow, making him slightly shorter than he was already.<br><br> 
Scott could feel his posture changing  more responding with by letting a little grunt,.Which soon turned into a deeper grunt as he felt something weird happening in the back of his legs. He could feel his hamstrings and calves widening, inflating to become giant muscular legs (even more muscular than that of Hugo) which were sharp becoming necessary to support Scott’s weight. <br><br>
Scott then roared up, throwing his clenched fists in the air and then started to pound his chest. John noticed that Scott’s arms had grow much longer than they were before,  and soon began to pulsate with power as his biceps bulged starting a chain reaction down his arms. Soon both of his arms were like two huge slabs of meat, his hands growing exceptionally big and gaining a slight cushioning on the palm. Scott slumped forward onto his knuckles, doing so caused hoody and t-shirt to rip directly off his body revealing a growing set of shoulders and muscular back. His pectoral muscles were also growing; it felt his heart was on fire as the muscles soon carved out his giant girth of a gut, giving it some definition and support so it didn’t just hang downwards. This added muscular support under the layers of fat finally pushed Scott’s pants to the limit, not earlier before had the majority of them  been decimated by his huge legs. <br><br>
The destruction of his pants revealed a giant powerful cock, with a huge mushroom head that pointed upward cutting an almighty almost foot long against his giant gut. His balls hung low between his legs, and Scott’s mind was overflowing with primal urges and lust as he entered the final stages of his transformation. His eyes darkened as a uni-brow and ridge jutted out of his fore-head, and his nose darkened and widened slightly. A little muzzle appeared and his neck muscles bulged with power as his head dropped down slightly.<br><br> 
His feet burst through his converse shoes, giving air to his giant muscular toes. Scott’s fine fuzz of body hair became a dense covering, as he soon became nearly covered in darkish blonde hair. Scott felt his body settling down, and he once again stood up on both hind-legs and let out an almighty animalistic roar whilst pounding his chest in raw power. The gorilla like Scott sat down on his giant behind and began to play with his penis whilst using the other hand to scratch his stomach.<br><br><br><br>
John couldn’t believe the transformation he’d just witnessed; Scott was the smallest of the beta’s but looked absolutely huge. He’d undergone an almost animalistic transformation, each person seemed to have their change determined by their character and nature. 
“Feel good... John smell good,” John was amazed that Scott knew his name; it must have been some mental connection he had with them. Scott was sat mindlessly playing with his cock, as John began to wonder if his car could move under the weight of Scott. Who looked like he could easily weigh a few tonne with that gut alone.</p>
