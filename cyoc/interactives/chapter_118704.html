<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On Mother&#39;s Day, there were plenty of Animalians who were soon to be mothers if they weren&#39;t already. Though some couples were holding out for a while before having any children. For most, it&#39;s so that the women can compete in the Animalian Games without the impediment of a swollen, heavy body. But there were other reasons as well.<br />
<br />
Janice Camberton had adjusted to being a skunk Animalian rather well and she deeply loved her mate, Walter. And yet, she was not ready to start a family of her own. The thought had some appeal, but she always had a nagging feeling about her own family back in France, about her mother who worked so hard so that she could have a better life in America.<br />
<br />
On Mother&#39;s Day, Janice and Walter were cuddling together while watching TV, but it was obvious that Janice wasn&#39;t really watching. &quot;You ought to call your mother,&quot; said Walter, &quot;She&#39;ll want to hear from you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know expensive a call to France is?&quot; asked Janice.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing we can&#39;t afford,&quot; said Walter, &quot;And you wouldn&#39;t let something like cost keep you from talking to your mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s just that...I don&#39;t think she had this in mind when I went to America. She wanted me to have a successful job, not change my species entirely,&quot; said Janice, slipping into her native French which was a sign of duress.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do have a successful job,&quot; said Walter, switching over to French, &quot;We make very good money with our modeling. Would your mother not approve of being a model?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She might, she might not,&quot; said Janice uncertainly, &quot;I have no idea how she feels about Animalia at all. How could I face if she thinks that I&#39;ve turned into a sinful creature?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother would never see you as that,&quot; said Walter, &quot;If she loves so much to pay for your education, then she&#39;d be happy that you&#39;re happy with your life, no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice sighed and said, &quot;I wish I could be certain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, there was a knock at the door. &quot;Were we expecting anyone?&quot; asked Walter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that I know,&quot; said Janice before she got up and headed for the door. When she opened it, she was surprised to see a woman outside. She was older-looking, probably older than she actually was. She had a tired, slightly haggard look to her, but there was still a kind, loving look in her eyes. Janice gasped in surprise, recognizing the woman that she knew so well. &quot;Maman?&quot; she asked in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice? Oh, it really is you!&quot; said her mother in French before grabbing her daughter in a big hug, &quot;Oh, Janice, you are so much bigger than I remember, in more ways that one. I said you would make it big in America, but I never thought it would be like this. Oh, you are so beautiful now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice&#39;s shock quickly dissolved as she hugged her mother. She had been so worried that her mother might reject her, but it was clear her mother loved her as strongly as ever. &quot;Oh, Maman, I wanted to see you, but I was worried what you&#39;d think if you saw me as a...&quot; said Janice.<br />
<br />
&quot;A polecat?&quot; asked her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;A skunk, actually,&quot; said Janice, &quot;Oh, come in, come in, you must meet Walter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should take my bags in first,&quot; said her mother.<br />
<br />
Janice looked over her mother&#39;s shoulder to see several bags on the porch. &quot;How long are you planning on staying?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Until I have my own house here,&quot; said her mother, &quot;I am an American citizen now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that is wonderful!&quot; said Janice, &quot;Come in, come in, my house is yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice soon introduced Walter to her mother, Anne Camberton. Anne was a little surprised that Walter was originally an ordinary skunk and seemed slightly annoyed that he caused her daughter&#39;s transformation by spraying her. But she didn&#39;t hold it against him. She was just glad her daughter was happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;So tell me, Maman. How is it you were able to come to America?&quot; asked Janice, &quot;The expense of moving overseas is very great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And immigrants aren&#39;t very welcome in America these days,&quot; said Walter, his tone showing the annoyance he was feeling towards the xenophobic members of the government currently in office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it was the strangest thing,&quot; said Anne, &quot;I received this package in the mail from the Animalian Reinvention Program.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The what?&quot; asked Walter.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a program for those who want to leave their old lives and move into Animalia,&quot; said Janice, &quot;There have been a lot of new people moving in that way. I didn&#39;t know you wanted to join so much, Maman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as much as I wanted to come, I couldn&#39;t,&quot; said Anne, &quot;The expenses were too high. But then this package arrives with not only a one-way ticket to Nevada, but basically everything I need to apply for American citizenship and joining Animalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice turned to Walter and asked, &quot;Walter, did you do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I did, but I didn&#39;t even know about that program,&quot; said Walter, &quot;Besides, I wouldn&#39;t know how to take care of that citizenship thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn&#39;t the strangest part,&quot; said Anne, &quot;Whoever sent the package left no note or anything about who sent it or why. I thought it might have been a scam, but I did check first. It&#39;s very genuine or else I wouldn&#39;t be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But who would want to bring you to Nevada?&quot; asked Walter. Janice gave her mate an annoyed look. &quot;I mean, not that your mother isn&#39;t nice, but who&#39;d sent an anonymous package all the way to France just for her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure, but right now, I couldn&#39;t care less,&quot; said Janice, &quot;What matters is that we&#39;re together and we can be a family again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will when I&#39;ve finished my application for Animalia,&quot; said Anne, &quot;Is there room for one more skunk here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Maman, you shouldn&#39;t feel pressure to be the same species as me,&quot; said Janice, &quot;You can be whatever you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What I want is to be close to my daughter again and my son-in-law. And I think my grandchildren would accept me better if I was the same species as them,&quot; said Anne. She gave Janice a stern look and asked, &quot;Am I to be a grandmother soon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we weren&#39;t really ready for that,&quot; said Janice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, good,&quot; said Anne, &quot;That means I&#39;ve got time to adjust first.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mystery of who sponsored Anne to come to Animalia still nagged at them, but the two Cambertons were just happy to be able to be together again.</p>
