<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felka&#39;s farmhouse wasn&#39;t too far away, but it wasn&#39;t close enough to make it their in tine before sunset either. After joining Felka&#39;s party, Alix accompanied her as far as they could go with the remaining light. What they never anticipated was that they would be moving way faster now that Alix was able to either fend off the enemies or avoid them entirely due to her Eagle Eye skill and her increased stat line. If you took the letter grades and added a numerical value to them, with F being 0, E being 1, D being 2 and so on, she went from a 2 up to an 8. Meaning she was 4 tines more able in a fight than before. Not to mention that although she lost her hands, having wings wasn&#39;t much of a setback since being able to fly had turned most of the battles in her favor alone. Plus she now could use some minor magics too.  But if she had to pick a single regret about becomming a harpy, it was the building pressure in her gut, which she just somehow knew wasn&#39;t her needing to releave herself. <br />
<br />
No, like many avian like existences, she would continue to lay egg after egg, reguardless of if it was fertilized or not. The thought of someday laying a fertilized one scared the shit out of her too. Would she eventually want a child? Or better yet, would she even want to be fucked by a man? The thought didn&#39;t sit well with her. She disliked the idea of being fucked by some guy immensely. However, there was a very small part of her that was now just slightly less against it. Call it a curiosity if you will. Basically, what would it feel like?  That though had brought down her being completely against being fucked to only extremely sure she didn&#39;t want it. She feared that the longer she lived as a harpy, the more her views would shift to align with those of a normal girl&#39;s, albeit a harpy girl, but a girl&#39;s nonetheless.  She already was thinking about herself using feminine pronouns like it was normal, and she did have the proper equipment now to do it with, so it was very possible she one day may find herself a nice husband. Maybe they would meet on an adventurer, or once she returned to the guild and wasn&#39;t killed on sight. No! No! Stop. She cant be thinking like that. She isn&#39;t like that. And that was why it was scary. She would spontaneously start daydreaming about girly things.<br />
<br />
While Alux was fighting her inner self, Felka called out to her. &quot;Alix, we are actually really close to my farmhouse, if we dont mind a short night run, we wont need to stop. What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine with either, your call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we will carry on, just maybe stay a bit closer to me okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alix swooped down closer to Felka as she sprinted through the sparsely covered forest. If the trees had been any closer, then Alix couldn&#39;t have flown quite as easily and would have had to walk in several places, slowing them down greatly. But because there was enough room, they were able to travel mostly uninterrupted. By the time Alix saw a distant light, the sun had already set a a short while ago, leaving them to walk the last few minutes in the dark. That was until Felka stopped their progress. Alix landed down next to her. After which Felka grabed onto and hugged, although while being careful to not injure Alix in the process. The both of them had bonded quite quickly over the last several hours, and now were very close to each other. Part of which was because neither of them had anyone else to call their friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you again so much Alix. I am being serious in saying I would be quite dead by now if you hadn&#39;t shown up. You have saved my life, and I owe mine to your&#39;s now. Any less and I wouldn&#39;t be able to sit with myself. So I wish to offer you myself. Or well, my connections that is. But I guess if you really just wanted to possess my body... I really have no room to say no. But I think not simply becomming me will end up helping you out the most. Mostly because my Master will not simply kill you on the spot then. So right now, I can offer you a deal. Come with me to meet my master. I will explain everything and she should agree to help you by making a new body for you. A biological doll to be exact, which you could then possess. It should be possible to make it ij any shape, size, and with the abilities or functionality of anything you can think of. For example, a woman&#39;s body, but with a cow udder and lays eggs to reproduce. Or whatever you can think of. All that will likely be required on your end, will be to become either my or my master&#39;s familiar. That said you could also just live with us as my friend if you want, but I can&#39;t guarentee she will ever agree to help you out. Those are the best options I can offer you. Of course you could also just fly away and never return here too. And although I will miss you dearly, I will respect your choice.&quot;</p>
