<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Brandon was having a fit back in his apartment, Walter Jannes was hard at work back in his lab making a serum flooded with Brandon Whyte&#39;s DNA.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure this is going to work?&quot; Came a deep voice from the other side of the lab. Walter looked up and over to his husband. It was finally getting easy to think of him as his husband. The large, muscular, black man in this early thirties was not the man who he had married, but that&#39;s what the serum had made him when they used it to reverse his brain cancer. Sometimes he still expected to see the short, stocky Latino he had made his vows with. Julio, or Julian as he went by now, was also the DNA donner to the initial serum for Brandon.<br />
<br />
Walter sighed. &quot;We&#39;re out of money, and this project is never getting approved for use unless we can control or eliminate the side-effects. We need Whyte&#39;s money and this is the easiest way to get our hands on it. Besides, the man is a grade-A asshole, I don&#39;t feel bad about correcting that. Hell, even his lawyer hates him enough that he&#39;s helping us with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of them were working on a new dose of the serum, but at this point it was just injecting the proper genetic material into each one. Walter&#39;s dinged first and he picked up the vial, giving it a look. &quot;Essence of Brandon Whyte.&quot; He said almost formally. He didn&#39;t waste much time getting it into an injector.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Now?&quot; Julian said as he stood up and strode across the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a very narrow window to wor..&quot; Walter cut off as the much larger man pulled him into a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;This better not turn you straight.&quot; Came a strict admonishment as Julian let him go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m pretty sure I isolated and removed that gene.&quot; Walter unbuttoned his shirt and picked up the injector to press against his chest, one pull of the trigger and he could feel it flowing through him. He knew it would take a while to start taking effect but he still looked down at his hands. His old bully&#39;s DNA was now flowing through him, the serum already reworking him. Soon he&#39;d have some of the body of Brandon Whyte in his prime. Enough to pass a DNA test showing paternity anyway.<br />
<br />
Julian had been loading up the other injector and carefully placed it in a satchel before handing it over to Walter. &quot;Calibrated properly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julian nodded. &quot;It should make him young enough to obliterate most of his memories and some of his personality. I&#39;ll call Thompson and let him know to get all the paperwork ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walter let out a sigh. This was it, no turning back, they were about to fake either the death or disappearance of Brandon Whyte and leave a sizable chunk of his money to his illegitimate son, a son that was now brewing inside of Jannes. Thompson, Brandon&#39;s lawyer, was getting a sizable chunk, too, for handling the estate and years of service, and with his recommendation some money was being funneled to other individuals. But Walter Jannes was going to get most of it, as well as control of Whyte&#39;s old company to keep a steady income. Brandon calling him out of the blue had been complete serendipity, but even he was surprised how quickly this plan came together. He just hoped he could trust Thompson.<br />
<br />
Jannes felt uncomfortable most of the ride over to Brandon&#39;s apartment. Where his clothes actually too tight or was that just his imagination willing the serum to work quicker. He pulled into the parking lot under the apartments, telling them Whyte was expecting him and getting waved through to the visitor&#39;s spots. He flipped down the visor to get a quick look in the mirror, making sure there was nothing to give him away. He ran his fingers through his hair, which had started to lose it&#39;s salt and pepper look, but had also started getting a bit lighter. A few less wrinkles, but nothing that couldn&#39;t be explained with an older man&#39;s attempts to look more youthful and a good night&#39;s sleep.<br />
<br />
When he got up to the apartment and knocked on the door, he was greeted with a sour looking man of mixed ethnicity. African was still at the forefront, but it was obvious there were other things in there. He was only wearing a pair of shorts, his muscular, furry chest on display for all to see. Walter had to admit he was kind of sexy, if not for the sour grimace. &quot;You came into contact with other people?&quot; He said as he stepped inside.<br />
<br />
Brandon glared but stepped aside for the doctor. &quot;You could have told me this would happen if I..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Had sex? I did.&quot; Walter breathed to keep his annoyance in check. He was really eager to put Brandon in his place. He hoped enough of Julian&#39;s DNA was in there to still show a familial connection. They needed to keep Brandon the biggest wild card of all under control. &quot;Hopefully it won&#39;t mess too much with the serum.&quot; Jannes set the satchel down on the kitchen counter just in time for one of the buttons on his shirt to suddenly give way, luckily Brandon was stomping around enough to cover the noise. &quot;I&#39;ll stay here on hand so I can monitor you.&quot; He needed to inject Brandon before he noticed something was off. He pulled out the injector, examining the vial. Inside was a mix of Julian and Brandon&#39;s DNA to hopefully make the transformative effects a bit more mild. He just wanted it to make him younger. Too young.<br />
<br />
Brandon was already seated on the couch, so Jannes walked over and as casually as he could, shot Brandon in the arm. &quot;You need to stay away from contaminating DNA this time. Any more injections and I don&#39;t know what will happen to you, a second is already pushing it. Good thing I&#39;m staying to keep an eye on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon stood up and stomped over to the stairs. &quot;I&#39;m going to lay down, and hopefully when I wake up this nightmare is over. Just.. stay quiet if you&#39;re going to lurk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon disappeared upstairs and Walter breathed a sigh of relief, it was pretty much done. Another button popped off his shirt and he winced. The thing really was getting too tight. He carefully tried to undo the remaining buttons, breaking off two more as he did so. He tossed his shirt aside and rand a hand over his torso. His chest was larger, shoulders broader, and he just had a touch more muscle all over. The slight potbelly he had that had come with age was starting to recede. Just seeing the changes was already getting him turned on. Too bad he needed to avoid his husband for the next few days, but when he was done he already knew the sex was going to be fantastic.</p>
