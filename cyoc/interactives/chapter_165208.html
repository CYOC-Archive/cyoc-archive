<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Timothy feels aroused at the sorry mess in front of him</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seeing him bawl his eyes out and making his face a sorry mess rings a tune Timothy he could not understand. His heart isn’t slowing even if the struggle is over. No. It’s speeding up but not from fear. It’s entirely different. Timothy felt a pressure growing on his groin and from there, he knew. He likes seeing him this way. No. He loves it.<br />
<br />
Tim had his hands on his face - he’s crying with eyes that he doesn’t know and a voice he isn’t familiar with. He doesn’t understand everything. The man on top of his smiled and grabbed him the hand. He thought he would care - whoever he is. Somehow, he managed to control the bodies in the room like a specter jumping between hosts. His face lowered and their kiss connected in a wet open embrace.<br />
<br />
Tim doesn’t want this. What the fuck is he doing? He tried breaking free but the specter is on a bigger body with a chest twice the size of his head. His hands imprisoned him on the floor while his tongue invaded his own. His tongue danced inside, wriggling and scouring all the insides of his mouth. Tim couldn’t breathe and he begged the man to stop with his red and raw eyes. But Timothy’s eyes are closed, he’s savoring the fear and salt brewing between them. His arms grasped by the back and lifted him where he advanced on his chest.<br />
<br />
“Fuck! Get off!” Tim pleads on deaf ears. Timothy is too into it. His heart pounded like a hammer on his chest whilst his mouth tasted every inch of skin he can. He left marks here and there, a lick behind the ears and trailing saliva on his cheeks. He sniffed and tasted the salt of their struggle. Tim was a mess but he remains a meal Timothy can feast on.<br />
<br />
Timothy traveled downwards on Tim’s groin where he was met with a flaccid 5-inch dick. He gave it a quick prod with his tongue. It responded with a quick nod, a jolt that surprised Tim. He knows that the man’s actions are horrendous. He should be baffled. Angry even. But somehow, he’s pressing all the right buttons. His body is singing a tune akin to instinct, a memory born inside the body he’s in. And so, the licks he received was met with confused excitement. He too is liking it. <br />
<br />
Timothy swallowed the whole thing and fondled the shaft with his tongue, careful not to scrape his canine over it. His tongue was nimble and fast, he did not choke but willingly swallowed it to the deep end. He swallowed it with ease and innate experience. Tim grunted at the wrong and right signals pinging all over his body. His hands that were protesting before were now digging on Timothy’s short-cropped hair, looking for an anchor as the waves of euphoria washed over him like a tsunami. His thought of breaking free was replaced by those of momentary joy that he hated and loved.<br />
<br />
Timothy moved deeper, now swallowing the balls. He pushed back Tim on the floor while adjusting his body so that his dick would be facing Tim’s face. His dick is engorged for some time now, reaching about 9 inches, red and throbbing. Whilst his dick is being sucked from a vacuum of a mouth, Tim tried to swat the dick dangling in front of his nose. The musk it excreted is intoxicating, it’s making him lose his breath. He tried to breathe for real air but all he can suck in is that pungent hard-hitting smell. Also, it’s way too big that every time he swatted it, it just returns to mock and torment him.<br />
<br />
And fuck. <br />
<br />
Timothy hit a good spot. Tim opened his mouth for a squeak of a moan and when he did, Timothy’s dick slipped inside. It’s girthy and the taste is just like what he imagined, briny and bitter. He wanted to spat it back but their rhythmic movement is making it impossible to do so. Timothy’s dick plunged deeper and deeper. He wanted to gag but all he could do is cry as he unwillingly sucked on his tormentor’s cock. <br />
<br />
The two men were in a wet embrace, one Timothy leads the tempo on. They writhed on the floor like one solid mass of flesh. Floorboards creaked in their wake but the sounds of their grunting moans filled the air in beats. In a matter of coincidence, they both felt that all too familiar feeling of their rushing seed. They guessed that it’s the same for all men. And yet, this feeling is magnified five-fold as their bodies were in storage for years without a release. Their tempo sped and Tim who was reluctant at sucking before was eating it up willingly. His thoughts of anger were gone. The only thing left in his mind anymore is his dick and his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Hnrgghh…” They groaned but not in symphony with another. Timothy grunted in a deeper baritone while Tim quipped like a mouse, despite having the body of a 40-year-old. <br />
<br />
Then they felt it all at once. A rush of pressure seething in their skin. Their asses clenched and the other muscles tightened. Tim was a coward who closed his eyes when the climax nearly came.  Timothy faced with opened his eyes in a welcome embrace. He needs to see everything and feel all of it. His eyes locked with Tim’s close eyes and …<br />
<br />
A release.<br />
<br />
An explosion that shook with deep throngs in their groin. <br />
<br />
A bang that shook them more than awake.<br />
<br />
Their hot steaming seed spilled over each other mouth, filling them to the brim. Timothy tasted all of it, the briny and tangy thick liquid beaded on his lips and licked every drop. Tim was on the other end. He was reluctant to swallow it but the meat blocked the only escape. There’s no other way Timothy’s cum is leaving Tim’s mouth. <br />
<br />
Timothy laid at the side, breathless but with an active mind. He’s young but he had sex with strangers before. But this - this takes the cake.</p>
