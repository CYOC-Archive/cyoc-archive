<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marie-Eliza spoke, &quot;So the witches told Marie Cruz everything, the lost of their families to <br />
sickness and the witch hunters. The adopt of their third sister into their little coven. <br />
Finding Princess, or rather Princess finding them. Their trip across the sea. The arrival in <br />
Glendale.... the death of their mother at the hands of the drunkard... <br />
<br />
Goldwyn 'forgiving' the killer and making him the monkey statue that would relive the few <br />
happy memories he had in his life over and over forever.   And their beginning to use <br />
magic to do as they thought other children and adults asked of them. The many golden <br />
deer. The statues. The dolls.<br />
<br />
 First the boys of their mother's employer the Wises. Then the Wises themselves. And of <br />
course... Joella.. and making her a statue for safe keeping until they were powerful enough <br />
to heal her from their bungle.   The loss of Goldwyn's eye, and their undying hatred for the <br />
wolf pack for the loss of Joella... <br />
<br />
The meeting of their familiars, and of course the the creation of the first fairy, followed by <br />
more fairies to come. <br />
<br />
The 'lesson' with Monica. The experiment with Rosa. The many failed attempt to resurrect, <br />
and then to -recreate- Joella resulting in the many fairy statuettes with Joella's face. Finally  <br />
the transformation of Madeline Yulle into Joella. <br />
<br />
The rune experiment that was supposed to create a paradise, that pack fired and 'opened <br />
their minds' in other words drove them completely mad. <br />
<br />
And then the candy meant to open the children's minds to the infinite chaos but in the <br />
process also drove them insane. The creation of Ben's family. The Witch Pride. And the <br />
horde of thugs the witches had annihilated out of existence to create Lark and her small <br />
family of quasi-siblings.<br />
<br />
The recoloring of the wolf-pack cubs. <br />
<br />
And of course the de-aging of all those in Glendale and those who came from the praying <br />
town, and the punishment of the slaver earlier that day. They left no detail out, they were <br />
proud of the work they had done.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You should restore each and every one of them Brides of Satan.&quot; Marie Cruz said referring <br />
to the objects and animals. Though the witches couldn't know that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to Hell.&quot; Gaal said simply and to the point without the normal zeal for that one <br />
sentence.  &quot;They're all happier, have found greater happiness, and kill us if you want Dog of <br />
God, but you won't steal the happiness we've manage to give to others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides.&quot; Golgatha said her one eye matching's Marie, &quot;Rearranging the strands of the <br />
living and making those strands eternal is simple enough, but reverting the Me that makes <br />
up each person Dog of God? Reversing the Self that defines them Dog of God? Even we <br />
can't make that mutton sandwich back into the animal!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're lying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know we're lying? Or do you wish we were lying so you could push everything we <br />
done for everyone out of existence and everything can go on orderly and predictable as if <br />
we had never existed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza spoke, &quot;The witches would sooner die than restore any of their victims... <br />
Willingly restoring them might have just maybe spared their lives.  However, Marie Cruz <br />
would wonder if there was another way to restore Madeline Yulle from Joella for example... <br />
only to realize that it would take had been a murder, to making it a double-murder. This <br />
choice would lead to more straining with her friendship with the others much as her choice <br />
to defend the witches had....&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The witches venomously denied that they sought to be kings of the world. They swore <br />
they wanted a world where all were equal, a world completely devoid of any law, and thus <br />
absolute freedom, with their magic providing everything for everyone always. They were <br />
certain beyond any doubt their new world would be anything other than perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
When Marie Cruz came down from upstairs.... the last she expected was to find a living <br />
room full of fairies fluttering about looking like naked women with insect wings and <br />
inhumane eyes.<br />
<br />
Linus sat down aggrivated while Draco did his best to keep their curious hands away. <br />
Kathrine didn't have so much as luck as they fairies apparently loved her pretty colors and <br />
Kathrine was practically fleeing from them as they tried once too often to look into places <br />
they shouldn't have. <br />
<br />
Some where floating over the unconscious Witch Pride and familiars, looking worried and <br />
concerned but not quite sure what to do. <br />
<br />
Monica, Rosa, and Mal'akh look at Marie embarrassed but somewhat calm. Finally Rosa <br />
said, &quot;Miss... I do believe we've found your jury.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz looked at the fantastic creature fluttering about, and felt a headache coming <br />
on. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
While their mother Marie Tyson was searching through the Frostvile directory trying to find <br />
Kathy's phone number with some help over the phone from Wanda who apparently knew <br />
the girl's family, Trevor asked his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you want to be called Nala so much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I'm actually an martian alien space princess from the future of an alternate <br />
universe.... JUST KIDDING! Because she's cool that's why!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor resisted rolling his eyes, that would be uncivilized. <br />
<br />
&quot;Found it!&quot; Their mother said, &quot;Now it's not quite too late in the evening, so I think it's safe <br />
to call her, now please remember to be polite Trevor and be sure to thank for the nice <br />
letter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor just nodded, having no idea they were talking about a girl who in a previous reality <br />
had been the girlfriend of Alpha-Kaylee before her firm belief that cats were superior to <br />
humans had driven him away. And that Trevor in this reality had been the one to give Kathy <br />
her cat ears and inspiring her family to move from Glendale rather than a near rape <br />
attempt. <br />
<br />
Of course, now Kaylee was an adult woman, not a teenage boy, and would have logically <br />
never met Kathy. To balance this out however, Kathy had been on relatively good terms <br />
with the teenage members of the Big Bad Wolf Pack, in spite of her prejudice. <br />
<br />
Marie Tyson called... waited a few seconds and finally there was a sultry answer on the <br />
other end, and she asked about Kathy with the sound of what sounded like two boys <br />
breathing fire in the background before finally getting the voice of a teenage girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;Merow-llo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this Katy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Marie Tyson... the mother of Trevor Tyson, I called to say thank you for your <br />
letter... my son had recently been returned to me after ... too long a time... and I just want <br />
to say thank you for that...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a lupman, forever, now and always. Only a lupman, could only be a lupman, was <br />
only a lupman, will be only a lupman, am only a lupman, never anything else.&quot;  Zelipe said <br />
holding the little mouse in one of the smaller 'den of wolves' away from the estate. <br />
<br />
His mother, Pearl, nearby talking with the lupmans who were in fact the little mouse's <br />
parents. <br />
<br />
While Kaylee and Isabelle had been chatting it out, the power of Zack's children had come <br />
up. And with that, Isabelle's cousin who had been turned into a mouse and had gone <br />
missing for a seemingly endless amount of time, until Madam Serenity had found him with <br />
the help of an unnamed Leoman cub who had nearly gotten eaten alive by rats while <br />
rescuing the little mouse. <br />
<br />
Part of the reason why Julie had come to Madam Serenity to find the 'lost' parents of the <br />
gem wolves. <br />
<br />
With Pearl not bed bound (unlike June), and home schooling a wreck with no many needing <br />
to see after the mundane needs of the injured and keeping the house in one piece, she had <br />
taken her son to the home of Isabella's cousin who was still a tiny mouse in the finally of <br />
big big wolves. <br />
<br />
As soon as Zelipe had spoken, the mouth grew bigger and bigger. The fur stayed grayish <br />
white, but that was it. The long naked tail because fluffy and a bit shorter. The claw <br />
became much larger. Eyes gained whites. Ears shrank and became pointed. Muscle mass <br />
increased dramatically. Then giant buck teeth went poof. His figure became one that was <br />
supposed to stand on two feet not four. His forepaw grew thumbs.  The muzzle became <br />
full of sharp fangs. <br />
<br />
And the 'mouse' got bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and BIGGER! <br />
<br />
Finally a leoman cub at nine years old (a year older than Zelipe), with grayish white fur <br />
stood looking at him. &quot;I'm me again... THANK YOU!&quot; The little boy hugged the light pink <br />
pup. <br />
<br />
It also gave Zelipe a sense of pride and purpose, that he could do things without his sister <br />
Amy around... <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Gillie wasn't sure how much longer she could stand this torture, and she thought being <br />
made a woman of a non-human species would be the low point of her new life... nope... <br />
not in the least... it was her companion now getting on GOOD TERMS with Gillie's <br />
grandparents!!!<br />
<br />
Gillie began to tune out the entire discussion, just begging the fates for some restitution <br />
and just please please let the discussion end! But Madam Serenity and Mother Glen were <br />
going full blast talking about historical events both of them had seen!  And Gillie had seen <br />
slightly different and major-league different versions than either remembered. <br />
<br />
But Mother Glen then said something that got Gillie's attention, &quot;YOU were the one whose <br />
been keeping care of Trevor since he vanished all this time-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again, I apologize, the killer-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not even mention him! I assure you I do not blame you! In fact it is an honor to meet <br />
you! I had heard about you through the Pack but I never imagined you'd have a connection <br />
to us as well. Even it amazing how fantastic the world is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Madam Serenity and Gillie looked at the children playing together. Seeing a little boy <br />
leoman kiss a little girl human on the cheek who became naked furry, larger, and bald <br />
seconds later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.... it is...&quot; Madam Serenity said simply. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Sarah/Ame-no-Uzume-no-mikoto knew she should be getting pack to work now.. she <br />
really should... but it was so fantastic to see Ulysess like this! Going to strong and so fast <br />
with her by his side, and she was sure he could hear her, or at least subconscious as she <br />
whispered encouragement and help him avoid little mistakes. <br />
<br />
What made things even more fantastic was latter when Amy came by and paid her proper <br />
dues, Sarah/Ame-no-Uzume-no-mikoto felt another shade of herself  leave with Amy, <br />
able to keep her senses with her as well as Ulysess at the same time while still in the entry <br />
way! And she didn't feel overwhelmed in the least! <br />
<br />
'This should be impossible...' Sarah/Ame-no-Uzume-no-mikoto whispered to herself.<br />
<br />
'So should be a lot of things.' The Monkey Prince/Kira replied in turn. <br />
<br />
And Sarah dreamed of a festival, with a purple leoman, purple felman, and purple scaled <br />
dragon attending with her chatting happily with her, even if she couldn't remember what <br />
they spoke about when she awoke.</p>
