<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before he could reach the living room, Jeff began to notice something. He soon saw that his body was starting to grow and his clothes were returning to normal. At that moment Jeff wondered why this had happened, but he decided to find out later and check what his mother was doing. Upon arriving at the living room, Jeff saw that his mother was sitting near the TV, watching a baby show.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you having fun mom?&quot;, Jeff asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Jeffy. This show is pretty funny. Although....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong mom?&quot;, Jeff asked her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing Jeff, it&#39;s just that I would like to enjoy this with someone else&quot;, his mother replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s no problem. I can easily turn myself into a toddler. I could even make dad a toddler too&quot;, Jeff replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;That wouldn&#39;t be bad. But I would rather enjoy this with someone more like me,&quot; his mother replied. Although this seemed somewhat complicated, especially considering the fact that his mother did not have friends or siblings, Jeff had an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you think of Dawn and her group of friends,&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean your friends&#39; mothers? I&#39;m not sure&quot;, his mother replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on mom. This way you can finally make friends,&quot; Jeff told her. Although his mother was unsure at first, she eventually accepted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, then let&#39;s go to my room to get everything ready.&quot; It was then that Jeff took his mother to his room and they began making alterations to the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
The first thing they did was alter the entire house. Now the house included a nursery which had everything necessary to care for a baby. And not only was there a nursery, now there were multiple toys and baby things scattered throughout the house and at some entrances to the rooms there were baby gates. They also made sure they had a large supply of diapers and baby food. And finally, in the living room there was now a large playpen full of toys, stuffed animals and among other things.<br />
<br />
But now that they had the house completely ready, it was time to bring the guests. And not only were they going to bring them, but they were also going to transform them.<br />
<br />
So making certain configurations in the Chronivac, the playpen in the living room began to be filled with women who had been turned into infants.<br />
<br />
There were 6 women in total and each one had been changed in a different way by Jeff following the instructions of his mother:<br />
<br />
The first was Lilah, who was turned into a 2-year-old toddler girl and wore a red onesie patterned with colorful birds.<br />
<br />
Next was Hazel. Jeff&#39;s mother didn&#39;t like her very much, so she asked her son to turn her into a 1-year-old baby girl and, just like her, wear only a diaper.<br />
<br />
After Hazel, it was Ruth. She had been turned into a 2-year-old toddler girl who now wore a white t-shirt and yellow overalls with a smiling sun in the center.<br />
<br />
Following Ruth, it was Edna. She was transformed into a 1-year-old baby girl, now wearing a green frog hooded romper.<br />
<br />
The second to last to arrive was Ashley. She was turned into a 2-year-old toddler girl who now wore a brown romper patterned with acorns.<br />
<br />
And lastly, it was Dawn. She was turned into a 2-year-old toddler girl who now wore a small orange dress which barely covered her diaper. Not to mention that she now had a pacifier in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;There. All of them are now in the playpen. I made sure to alter the reality of their families so that they don&#39;t wonder what happened to them. And also their transformations last the same time as yours. You want me to alter their memories?&quot;, Jeff asked his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, leave them as they are,&quot; his mother replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you still want to be the oldest of them, or you want to change your age to be the same as theirs,&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, I think I&#39;d rather be 2 years old than three. And if you wouldn&#39;t mind, could you put me in some of my new shirts?&quot; her mother asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
It was then that Jeff altered his mother&#39;s age and put a blue t-shirt on her that said &quot;I&#39;M 2&quot;. A female babysitter would come to take care of the 7 babies, but in the meantime Jeff went to take his mother to meet her new baby friends, who were...</p>
