<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Rick sighed as he looked at the guarded warehouse. In a few minutes he and some others were going to raid that warehouse and 
seize the weapons inside. That is if everything went according to War's plan. He seemed like a competent man from what he could tell. Of 
course to minimize the chances that they would all be caught if one of them was they used code names and covered themselves from 
head to toe. War also used a voice synthesizer so no one could recognize his voice.</p>
<p>Rick watched the guards movements and was pleased to see that they were patrolling just as Snitch had said. She had spent hours 
spying on the warehouse and was even able to give an estimate of what it held. She had done this at great risk since if she had been 
caught she would have been turned into a statue. Of course he was risking the same but he felt he had to do it. He had seen people who 
had been turned into a metal statue being melted down and it sickened him. He hoped that they weren't alive trapped in that form. Also he 
had to wonder if somehow they were still alive if the melting would kill them or if they would continue to live. He shuddered at that every 
time he thought about it. Better for them to be dead then to live as a statue.</p>
<p>Rick saw the opening and started slipping toward the warehouse. His mission was to get inside and disable the security systems. That 
was easier said than done since they had no idea what type of security other than the obvious guards and cameras the warehouse had. If 
Snitch's info was right then he didn't have a lot of time to squeeze through the opening. With maybe a second to spare he was able to slip 
through and into the warehouse.</p>
<p>He looked around at the small room he found himself in. It was quite dark so unless there was a night vision camera in here he 
wouldn't be seen. As his eyes adjusted he remembered the blueprints that Google had been able to procure. How he did it was anybody's 
guess but the knowledge would come in handy. Of course Rick had concerns that Google might be a spy but he hadn't known the group 
for long. Anyway the room he was in had been labeled as a security office but feeling around a little bit confirmed that it wasn't now. He 
would have to go out into the warehouse itself and try another location suggested by Logic. He had his hand on the doorknob and was 
easing the door open when he had this feeling that things were about to go terribly wrong. He couldn't back out now though so he steeled 
himself and crept out of the former security office. Once he had someone hit him over the head and he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>He came to in one of those clear boxes that the NWO used for "terrorists". He was also completely naked and he was sure that any 
minute the strange mist would be pumped in and he would become a statue. Though looking around he wasn't out in public but in some 
sort of lab. A middle aged guy was standing before him with a smile. "Glad to see you've finally awakened," the man said with a huge 
smile. "My name is Anthony Bulgari and I'm going to ask you some questions. If you cooperate and answer truthfully I'll let you go. Now 
then what is your name?"</p>
<p>"Little Girl," Rick replied with a smile. That was the code name he had been given at the first meeting.</p>
<p>Anthony didn't seem to like that since he said, "I told you to cooperate and be truthful. Now what is your name?"</p>
<p>"I told you my name," Rick said with a bigger smile. "If you don't like it just put me out in public and change me into a statue."</p>
<p>"If you're hoping that someone will come save you you can forget it since your fellow terrorists are dead," Anthony said scowling.</p>
<p>Rick shrugged and said, "I didn't expect anyone to come rescue me if I were caught anyway." He wasn't sure if Anthony was telling the 
truth or not but if he was he would be sad. There had been good people on the team.</p>
<p>Anthony seemed to think for a moment then said, "We have a spy in your group who has provided us with some interesting 
information. A piece of that information is the location of your base which we are in the process of raiding." Another man came up to him 
and spoke quietly in his ear. After Anthony looked at Rick with a very angry look on his face and said, "It appears that there was no base 
at that location."</p>
<p>Rick had to laugh and after a moment said, "Of course not genius. Did you really think we would have a base where if one of us were 
captured we'd give it up or if there was a spy in our midst? You must not be too high up if you're that stupid."</p>
<p>"Enough of this," Anthony roared. He turned to a guy in a white lab coat and said, "Pump in the mist."</p>
<p>The guy obeyed and soon the mist was pumped into the box. Rick was expecting to just freeze in place but as a wave of pain hit him 
he doubled over and let out a scream. The pain was unbearable and he wanted to lose consciousness again but he couldn't. He was able 
to get a look at Anthony's smiling face. He thought he would be transformed into a statue but those that became statues didn't move once 
they mist started transforming them. This must be a different kind of mist then since he was able to still move around and scream in pain. 
And to think he had an hour of this torture to go. Maybe Anthony hoped that he would give up anything so he wouldn't have to go through 
this again. But what was he changing into?</p></p>
