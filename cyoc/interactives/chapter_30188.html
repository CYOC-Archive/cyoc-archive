<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zebulon was your average college student; to an extent...  He was a psychology major and was fascinated by the mind, and desires of the psyche.  He had a difficult time adjusting to the college life, all the new faces, the social pressures, the work load, etc.  That is until he met Leland.  At first Zebulon was strongly drawn and attracted to Leland both physically and emotionally.  Zebulon had been a closeted homosexual all his life, and hated not being able to be himself.  Zebulon's father was a pastor in a evangelical church, full of dogma and anti gay and anti abortion sentiments.  (you know the type that protests at abortion clinics; and picketts gay pride parades)  This fact alone made it impossible for him to be openly gay.  If he were to tell his parents of his sexual orientation, he was sure college would no longer have been an option.  Afterall his father was picking up most of the tab.  He decided to remain silent about his homosexuality until he was completely indepent of his parents and their radical belief structure. He was often locked away in his dorm room studying for classes, not interacting with other students, just being a total recluse.  That is until he met Leland.  Leland was a Lacrosse player, he was handsome, charming, and surprsingly despite looks that could make on arrogant; he was one of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet. Anyways he became the most happy and fufilled after meeting Leland; more happy than he had ever been his entire life.  He was beginning to fall in love, but he repressed his desires for the sake of friendship.  He dreaded going home for vacations for the fact of being away from Leland; and for being around the depressive environment that his parents created.  He would lie awake at night for hours dreaming of being with Leland; his soul yearned for Leleand, and his heart ached to be with him.  He had never met anyone like Leland, and they became the best of friends.  Later on in the semester; Zebulon was at a college party where tequila shots and beer were being partaken in the festivities.  After having several shots of tequila and a few beers; along with Leland, they became extremely intoxicated.  He was slightly more sober than Leland however and therefore assisted Leland back to his dorm room Zebulon got the biggest shock and most pleasant surprise of his life, even moreso than when he got accepted into college.  Leland in his drunken state confided in Zebulon that he was in fact gay; and had a boyfriend that he met in highschool.  Their relationship had been kept discreet up until this point, but he confessed of being tired of it.  All the lies, trying to keep the girls off of him without divulging his secret.  He confessed to Zebulon that he was going to come out and end the frustration.  Zebulon of course accepted him and supported him; but he still was way too scared to disclose my own secret to him.  If it ever got back to his parents (which was highly unlikely; but he feared his father's wrath and thus was extremely paranoid), his life would be ruined.  <br />
Weeks passed, and Leland had come out completely, he even brought his boyfriend around on campus.  At first other students were shocked, some expressed disgust especially since Leland was on the Lacrosse team, and changed in the same locker rooms.  After a while the shock wore off, and things were back to normal; except for the fact that Leland's boyfriend Xavier was now often hanging around. Zebulon now felt like the third-wheel with Xavier tagging along all the time. Zebulon became increasingly jealous of Xavier; that he was with the man of his dreams; that he could be open about his sexuality, and not be disowned by his parents.  Physically Xavier was quite the specimen, he would be any gay man's desire, but Zebulon desired Leland.  To him no one could compare to Leland's personality, dashing good looks, and charisma.  Zebulon thought of Xavier as a distant second to Leland, but hot nonetheless.  He hated watching Xavier lock lips with the man of his dreams, he fostered hate, jealousy, and envy towards Xavier increasingly over time.  He started wishing he was Xavier, that he could have Xavier's good looks, his loving accepting family, and most importantly Leland as a boyfriend and the love of his life.  He often masturbated to the thought of actually being Xavier and having Leland's arms wrapped around him.  He wanted this fantasy to become his reality.  He knew it made no rational sense, and was scientifically impossible, but he entertained his fantasies by researching body swapping and the ideal throughout mankind; from its very origins; to theories of how it could be done.  He searched hopelessly almost giving up hope until he stumbled across....</p>
