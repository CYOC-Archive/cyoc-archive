<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the elevator opened, Dave was startled to see a uniformed security guard blocking him from leaving. She was slightly shorter than Dave, with an athlete&#39;s build and her brown hair pulled back in a severe ponytail. She stepped into the doorway, resting her hands on her belt, which Dave noticed sported both a taser and tactical baton.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good evening?&quot; Dave asked,  stalling for time to think as he stepped back to stand near the rear of the elevator. He racked his brain to think of her name, he&#39;d passed her other evenings checking out after working late. Stacy? Tracy? Susan? He couldn&#39;t remember for the life of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr... Bahner? I understand you&#39;re responsible for the naked woman my colleague apprehended sneaking down the back stairs?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Apprehended?&quot; Dave asked. &quot;Naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny had been dressed, well, as dressed as she could be in three pieces of a not very big to begin with t-shirt when she&#39;d left his office. Dave couldn&#39;t imagine why she&#39;d have stripped, especially since everyone knew there were cameras in the stairwells.<br />
<br />
The elevator dinged and attempted to close, but the doors rebounded from the security guard&#39;s feet. She stepped into the elevator, projecting almost palpable menace. Dave tried to step back, but he was already against the wall. He resisted the urge to slide into a corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;She said you&#39;d be able to explain her nudity and presence in the building after hours. When I ran your name I noted you got promoted today.  Congratulations on the promotion, btw, but you&#39;ve got some serious explaining to do.&quot; She folded her arms across her chest.  <br />
<br />
Behind her the doors closed, trapping them together in what felt like a very confined space to Dave, though he noticed it wasn&#39;t that much smaller than the average cubical on his floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, there&#39;s a very good explanation...&quot; Dave began speaking.<br />
<br />
To his lust vision the security guard, why couldn&#39;t he remember her name? was solid black with crackling white lines like lightning flowing from her torso outward to the ends of her limbs. Dave made a mental note to write himself some better understanding of his new perceptions the first chance he was able. <br />
<br />
He started by describing the prank Jenny had pulled on him, his promotion, her censure, and, recalling belatedly that he&#39;d protected himself, explained they&#39;d been having sex all afternoon, and were headed to his place once she got dressed. He did not mention the pen, of course, or his romp with his secretary.<br />
<br />
During his recitation, the lightning had faded, and with it the security guard&#39;s tension. By the time he finished she was mostly green, and leaning casually against the elevator doors. She was even half-smiling at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Four hours, huh?&quot; She looked him up and down. &quot;And headed home for more?  My boyfriend passes out as soon as he cums.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave saw the faintest hints of yellow in the area of her crotch and lips. He debated the wisdom of delaying his night with Jenny, but she&#39;d have to get used to him fucking other women eventually, and Dave felt a sudden curiosity what the woman he was with wore under her uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s a shame, I hope he at least has the courtesy to hold off until you&#39;ve had one?&quot; Dave smiled, willing her warmer all over.  If he&#39;d said something like that to a woman yesterday he&#39;d have been flushed, sputtering, and sporting half a chub. As it was, he felt calm and in control. And not just of himself. The security guard was yellow from head to mid thigh, with orange deepening in her crotch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, usually one, sometimes more.&quot; She smirked at Dave.  &quot;Doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t keep going without him once he&#39;s done though.&quot; There were white sparkles in her head, which confused Dave for a minute until he realized she must be enjoying the flirting?<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your record? Not that I&#39;m likely to have a higher score,&quot; he gave her his best boyish grin, &quot;But after today Jenny might.&quot; He pressed on the sparkles, was was gratified to see her crotch rapidly darkening to red, her lips and breasts becoming orange.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really? You think you could help me break my record?&quot; She reached up and toyed with her ponytail, the sparkles swirling as they flowed down her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think,&quot; Dave said, taking a step forward and locking eyes with her, &quot;that at the very least I won&#39;t fall asleep on you.&quot; He willed her hotter, watching the orange spread along her limbs in his peripheral vision.<br />
<br />
She took a step as well, leaving bare inches between them. Her lips were nearly white with sparkles, and Dave saw some perspiration beading in her face. &quot;&#39;Won&#39;t&#39;?&quot; She asked softly, licking her lips. &quot;Don&#39;t you mean, &#39;wouldn&#39;t&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave reached up, brushing a thumb across her cheek and sliding his hand around to caress her hair. She tilted her head into his touch, her eyelids drooping slightly. Dave leaned in, giving her the kiss she so ardently desired. Her arms were around him, her tongue snaking into his mouth. Dave willed himself rock hard as their bodies met and entwined.<br />
<br />
The security guard, whatever her name was, was making soft mewling noises as they kissed. Dave helped himself to a double handful of her ass, each squeeze pulsing her color deeper and deeper. She pulled her lips free but kept her arms wrapped around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not here!&quot; She gasped. &quot;Cameras--ah!&quot; She broke off speaking as Dave began nibbling the side of her neck. She slapped a hand on the elevator panel, eventually getting the doors to open. They stumbled out into the darkened hallway, both panting and clutching eachother.<br />
<br />
Dave let her spin and pin him against the wall as she pressed her lips and body against his. He slid his hands down to squeeze her ass some more, and she pulled away, leaving him reaching out to her.  She was red to her fingertips, with flares of white at her breasts and loins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Catch me!&quot; She hissed, and whirled to run down the hall.<br />
<br />
Caught off guard, Dave watched her duck around a corner. He could still see her in his lust vision, unaffected by walls and furniture, but her footsteps got fainter as he caught his breath, glancing around.  They were on the third floor, where building maintenance and presumably security offices were located. HR was down on the first floor, were he was supposed to meet Jenny, assuming the security guards had let her go. If not she was probably around here somewhere.<br />
<br />
Dave hesitated, should he follow the guard and spend some time giving her enough orgasms she&#39;d get wet at the mere thought of him? Or try to find Jenny, who was likely around here somewhere?  Maybe, he thought, I should go back up for the pen, since it might get him out of any trouble he and Jenny were in. Decisions, decisions.</p>
