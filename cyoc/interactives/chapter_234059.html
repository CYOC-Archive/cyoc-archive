<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took George ten minutes to locate the two remaining intruders, thanks to his connection to the stone. If he had to search them the normal way, it could have taken hours.<br />
Mike and Sei had explored many rooms on the east side of the manor, and now where on the west side, wandering the third floor. So far, the rooms up here were mostly bedrooms, with a few bathrooms in between. Whoever had once owned this place surely had received many guests. That, or they had about fifty children living here. <br />
What had made them curios was the missing dust. The rooms looked all in clean shape, as if they had been made ready just hours ago. They had asked themselves if the manor was still inhabited by someone. Right now, both had decided on a break, and relaxed sitting on a sofa in one of the bedrooms.<br />
George waited, and sure enough, the teens were soon asleep. It was part of the manor´s magic, relaxing in a bedroom would make you fall asleep for an hour, and only the old owners had known how to wake someone up early, not that George knew that. He had waited for them to come out, so it wouldn´t look like he searched for them in a random room.<br />
When he heard the two snoring, George walked in and tried to wake them unsuccessfully. “Well, this way, they won´t fight” he thought, and then shouldered Sei, who was the lighter one, like a sack of potatoes over his right shoulder. Mike, he threw over the other shoulder. Lucky, he had absorbed this much muscle from the brothers, adding his natural strength, which hadn´t diminished after switching with the little brother, it was rather easy carrying the two. With an arm around their legs each, George walked back outside to the others. On the way out, he spotted an old ax hanging on the wall, and took it with him to give it to the bull.<br />
When the thief wandered back into the sight of his caught intruders, all three mentally cried out in shock. Johnny had a small part thanking the thief for getting revenge, but it was small compared to the sadness of their last hope getting extinguished. Ryan was disbelieving, knowing neither Mike nor Sei would be easily knocked out, while Eric feared what would happen to them now.<br />
Not needing them restrained, George only removed the backpack Mike had worn from them. “Bull, you will spit on them both, each on their right foot. Just to make sure they aren´t able to get away.” He ordered Eric, and watched satisfied when the spit ate away their shoe and sock, before their now bare right foot turned to stone from the spit, easily connected to the ground. The spit wasn´t enough to cover more, but that had been his intention. <br />
Eric was shocked how he had trapped his friends, and hoped it wouldn´t work until he was seeing their now stoney, bare feet sticking to the stones, He then knew they would never escape. All three of them cried in sorrow at their fate.<br />
They had to wait a bit more than half an hour before both teens slowly woke up. While they waited, George gave the ax to the bull an let him spit onto it, too. Soon, the ax was stone covered, and fitted the bull. <br />
Mike was immediately aware of being both cold and laying on a hard surface. Remembering the soft sofa he had drifted off on, he opened his eyes in panic, knowing something was wrong. He tried jumping away from the feet he could see, only to crash back down when his right foot didn´t move with him, pulling him back painfully.<br />
Sei woke fully when he heard that crash and a following moan of pain, opened his eyes and tried to get up. He had wanted to ask what Mike had done, only to realize he couldn´t move to him, because something hold him back. Thinking he had been shackled by his right foot, he looked backwards, only to see his foot looked grey and he was unable to move his toes. He tried tugging his leg up, but that was impossible. It was as if his foot was glued to the ground. “What the hell?” he exclaimed.<br />
George laughed at them, gaining their attention. It was amusing him to see their attempts to get away. Both now looked up at him in a mix of fear and anger. “What have you done to us?” they screamed nearly as one.<br />
George grinned down at them. “Until now? Nothing but bringing you here and making sure you don´t leave again. What I wanted to do needed you two awake, so thank you for finally waking up.” The last was said with scorn.<br />
“What have we done?” asked Mike after a few seconds of silence. He still tried to get up, but whatever had his foot trapped held tight.<br />
“You are intruders in this manor. The last of your little group to catch I believe. You were five, right?” George explained shortly, already knowing they were only five. Let´s see if they lie now.<br />
There was a bit of shocked silence before Sei screamed again: “What have you done to Ryan and Eric, you asshole?” His tries to escape the stone hadn´t done anything but making him angrier.<br />
When Mike didn´t add anything to that, George shook his head in suppressed anger. “So, the little one is truly unimportant to you, huh? You had the nerve to come here and insult him and his brother, and now you ignore him again? Shows what friends you are.”<br />
After a couple of insults to both him and Johnny, George had enough. “Silence, you insolent pests. Before, I thought you would at least have some good in you. Now? Now I know you are the monsters here. Just adds to your punishment. Bull, Kiddo, spit them some more, let them slowly change in spots before our main guest can do the rest to get his revenge.”<br />
At first, neither Mike nor Sei knew what he meant. That was, until both felt cold spit hit them. Ryan, near to Mike, spit every few seconds at him, in various spots, leaving only the head after a few minutes. Eric spit more at once, but with bigger intervals, at Sei, who was nearer to him.<br />
Bit by bit they both got more stone onto their bodies, feeling heavier by the second. At the first few bits of spit, both had screamed at the, at first, unseen attackers. But soon, they knew exactly what was spitting at them, not that it turned their insults any better. The stone spit eats away their clothes, leaving them naked as it went on while George watched them.<br />
“Enough, Bull, Kiddo. How does it feel, huh? A little info, the minotaur was you friend Eric before, while the small gargoyle was Ryan. Now, for the final bit, the honor is yours, Big One. Show them how much you liked their insults.” George said, which instantly stopped Eric and Ryan, only to give Johnny the freedom to finish the two off.<br />
Both Sei and Mike were red from the strain to scream, lack of air from their petrified lungs, and anger over this abuse. But now they had turned white in shock, hearing that it was their friends. Before either could say anything else, Johnny nearly vomited the stone liquid on them, forcing both to swallow some of the liquid as they had just wanted to start speaking. <br />
“Good, now let´s see what to do with them” George said as Johnny stopped. All three were in mental tears, even if Johnnys were fewer. After all, they had been assholes to him.</p>
