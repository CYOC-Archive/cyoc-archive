<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Left with no choice but to go along with the flat-chested ladies in the ugly outfits, Emma had found herself dragged off and squirlled away inside a tent, sat down at a table in one chair with an empty seat across from her. The way they had put the magic icky restraints on her was especially annoying - she couldn&#39;t play with her huge titties or squeeze her heart-shaped ass or finger her tight pussy or anyhting! Why did they have to be so mean?! She was just thoroughly frustrated by the a blonde girl who&#39;d be way cuter without the awful uniform or the glasses stepped inside, taking a seat at the table and setting out some kind of vial of glowy green stuff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that, we&#39;re ah, we&#39;re a bit busy.&quot; She smiled, and at least seemed nice, even if she wasn&#39;t letting Emma make herself feel good or go find Millie. &quot;I&#39;m Taylor. I know you must be confused, and I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re already feeling pent up, stuck in here, so...&quot; She pushed the vial towards Emma. &quot;I whipped this up for you. It&#39;ll make you feel really, <i>really</i> good, I promise.&quot; <br />
<br />
That sounded nice. But she wasn&#39;t sure if she could trust anybody who was dressed so not-pretty. &quot;You promise it will? What&#39;s it gonna do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;ll feel like sex in a bottle,&quot; she assured her, instantly piquing Emma&#39;s interest. &quot;It&#39;ll make you feel so good, and... and it&#39;ll make your boobs and your butt just so huge you won&#39;t hardly be able to fit in here anymore! You&#39;ll be so hot, Millie won&#39;t be able to look at you without getting soaking wet all over herself, I swear!&quot;<br />
<br />
That all sounded good enough for her. With her hands a bit less restrained, Emma rushed to grab the vial, drinking down the whole thing in one big gulp. It felt weird and sticky and kinda funny, but she put up with it, figuring that it was worth it to be as sexy as she could be for Millie. But after a second, her head started hurting - and she started feeling less sexy, a lot less sexy, even though her boobs were still the same size. She started... ugh, she started thinking! Why was she thinking about icky things that didn&#39;t involve making love to her Millie?! Why was she thinking about the gemstone and not being a bimbo... and... and...<br />
<br />
Her eyes widened as awareness slowly returned, her mind dragged kicking and screaming away from total airheaded lust and back to a normal state. She let out a pained groan, her whole head throbbing; the magic that had changed her body was raging, struggling to keep her dumb and obsessed with sex, but the clearing of the fog continued. She could remember things now, recalling how she ended up... like this, how she got here. Who these SALEM girls were, and the whole disaster unfolding outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhhhh crap.&quot;<br />
<br />
The way Emma spoke, in the tone of a sassy 20-something and not a vapid bimbo, seemed to give Taylor a huge sigh of relief. &quot;Oh thank Christ, it&#39;s working.&quot; She frantically jotted down something on a notepad before turning her attention back to the mermaid. &quot;Okay, that potion&#39;s not gonna last long - Emma, I need you to tell me everything you can about what happened in there, how you got out, and that amulet you brought with you. Please - we need to know...&quot; She paused as sounds of yelling and people rushing to secure another breach could be heard outside. &quot;...before this spirals way beyond control.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mind temporarily restored, the pink-haired woman felt like they might already be past that point, but she&#39;d do her best to help the witch across the table from her. Quickly she rattled off the sequence of events, from when she and Millie had spotted Adie using the amulet, to their being trapped in the magic shop, to Millie sacrificing herself as Emma grabbed the necklace and used it to escape, only to tumble out the other side of her little emergency portal much farther along in the bimbofication process. All the while, she could feel some fog at the back of her mind trying to drag her back into the idiotic void, but the thought of her fiancee still trapped in there just barely gave her the strength to hold on.<br />
<br />
&quot;...protective charm!&quot; Taylor snapped her fingers just after the end of Emma&#39;s explanation. &quot;Adie, she must have had a protective charm that got corrupted - that&#39;s why the thing is putting out lust magic like crazy!&quot; Her brief smile turned to a frown. &quot;But... purifying that... it&#39;d take hours...&quot; The commotion outside was an indication that they had, at best, minutes. <br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s gotta be something we can do!&quot; She scratched her head, the strain growing with every single moment. &quot;Can&#39;t we just... use the amulet to undo everything?&quot;<br />
<br />
The blonde was silent for a moment as she considered it. &quot;Not directly, no... but... maybe... no, no, that&#39;s not an option...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure <i>anything</i> is an option right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe....&quot; She stood up, pacing back and forth and scratching the back of her neck. &quot;If it&#39;s been corrupted to output lust magic, then it&#39;ll be able to draw in that same energy. So someone could use it to suck all the magical corruption out of the mall and those people, but... whoever did that... I don&#39;t even want to think about what it&#39;d do to them...&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of weapons fire and yelling erupting outside cleared away any potential doubt Emma might have had. They were out of time... and she was willing to do <i>anything</i> to save her fiancee. &quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot; She hopped to her feet, strained slightly by the immense weight of her chest, but moving fast as she could. &quot;I have true love to help resist it, and your potion thing... I&#39;ll try and fight back against whatever it does to my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor still looked incredibly reluctant, but they truly didn&#39;t have another choice. Praying silently that she was making the right decision, the blonde grabbed Emma&#39;s wrist and dragged her out of the tent, into a scene of spiraling chaos; Olivia was not far off, looking to have been fully bimbofied, and a small hole in the barrier had allowed the infected to start surging out. One by one, soldiers and officers were going down, being transformed and sent sprawling out in throes of pleasure or infecting their sisters in arms. Taylor tried not to look as she rushed the mermaid over to the lab tent, shoving right past technicians who were already more concerned with getting ready to bug out than with studying the amulet.<br />
<br />
As the blonde grabbed another green vial and started hastily casting some spell onto it, Emma rushed to the necklace, picking it up with some trepidation. The moment she did, the voices in her head screaming about lust and pleasure and endless indulgence of the flesh increased in volume a hundred-fold; she very nearly might have surrendured, if not for Taylor suddenly forcing a much larger dose of her concoction down her throat. It dragged her once more back into rational thought, if only for a second; she nodded in appreciation before rushing back out, lifting the amulet up towards the horde of bimbos, and willing the pink gemstone to draw in all the lustful magic in the area.<br />
<br />
She could feel it working - the bimbos were entranced as tendrils of magenta energy began to trail out from them and from the mall, growing in strength and frequency as the gemstone became a magnet for the transformative magic that had caused this disaster. But at the same time, Emma could feel that same corrupting force surging into her, screaming in her mind, the collective lust of hundreds of bimbos screaming in her mind. Desperately her eyes locked onto Millie out in the crowd, tears forming as she fought with everything she could muster to keep the process going... until at last, the pink mist cleared, and all the bimbos began to return to their human forms and minds, the mall retreating from its extreme girlification and back to its previous form.<br />
<br />
It had worked... but now, held in Emma&#39;s hand, was a glowing amulet pulsating and crackling with bolts of pink electricity, the energy jumping to her body and driving her curves and proportions to new extremes with every second. It felt as if she was holding a nuclear warhead of pure lust, the last shreds of her willpower keeping it from exploding - and as the tears streamed down her face, she wasn&#39;t sure if even her love for Millie, powerful as it was, would be enough to keep this thing contained.</p>
