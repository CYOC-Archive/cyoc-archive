<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fortune has a strange way of showing itself. For not even before they had finished their meeting with the three girls who had breast hyperthropy, Ami received a message on her phone. She took one look at it and said, &quot;I don&#39;t believe it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently a white orca has beached itself on the south shore,&quot; said Ami.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, here?&quot; asked Andrew, &quot;Are we even near any usual orca hunting grounds?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they do range all over the world,&quot; said Ami, &quot;But there&#39;s only one way to describe such a stroke of luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Contrived?&quot; asked Tsuku.<br />
<br />
&quot;Precisely,&quot; said Ami.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The killer whale wasn&#39;t that hard to spot when they got to the beach. Even despite its size, its coloring made it stand out like a sore thumb. The orca wasn&#39;t perfectly white like a beluga whale. However, the parts of its body which should be black on a normal orca were a very light grey, almost silver. It was also truly beached and thus it couldn&#39;t get away even if it wanted to. Upon closer observation, it was clear that this was a seasoned orca. Its pale hide was covered in many scars, its dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins all had nicks on them, the dorsal fin had a large bite taken out of it, and its left eye was completely gone. Because a good part of its dorsal fin was missing, it couldn&#39;t immediately identified as male or female like with most orcas. They were able to confirm that its remaining eye was blue, so this was a leucistic orca instead of an albino.<br />
<br />
A small DNA sample was taken so they could confirm what sex the orca was. In the meantime, Jen and Andrew tossed buckets of water onto the orca to keep it from drying out. Kumiko stayed next to the orca and kept speaking softly and soothingly to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would it even beach itself here?&quot; asked Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear orcas chase their prey into the shallows and partially beach themselves in order to catch them,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;This one must have miscalculated and got stranded.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked out at the sea and asked, &quot;Orcas are supposed to be social animals, right? Where&#39;s the rest of the pod?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If this is a male, he might be a rover,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;But the pod might be still be out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko looked up and asked, &quot;If that&#39;s true, shouldn&#39;t we be returning this whale back to its family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First off, orcas are actually dolphins,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;And secondly, look how battleworn this one is. Chances are it is a male and it&#39;s battled a lot of other bulls for mating rights. He&#39;d probably only have a few years left before a younger orca kills him or a shark blindsides him. He&#39;s probably ready to retire and be reborn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming it is a male,&quot; said Kumiko.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Ami came back with both the DNA results and a sample of the Animalia virus. &quot;Well, this orca is definitely a male,&quot; said Ami.<br />
<br />
&quot;One that&#39;s obviously past his prime and ready to restart life,&quot; said Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; said Ami, &quot;Which will give Kumiko exactly what she wants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kumiko flushed at that. She was excited to become an orca Animalian so soon, but she wasn&#39;t expecting something like this. &quot;How exactly will this work?&quot; asked Kumiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first we uplift this orca,&quot; said Ami, &quot;Then he&#39;ll be able to convert you. And the two of you should be able to double-dose each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In which case, we probably ought to give them some privacy,&quot; said Tsuku.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; said Ami, giving the orca his shot, &quot;Kumiko, this particular orca doesn&#39;t have to be your bond-mate, but you will give a good first time as an Animalian, won&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as he does the same for me,&quot; said Kumiko.<br />
<br />
With that, the Animalians left Kumiko alone with the killer whale. The orca was already showing some signs of changing. The Animalia virus couldn&#39;t truly remove mass, but it can redistribute it. The pectoral fins surged in size as they were remolded into arms. The legs had to made out of excess mass as cetacean hind legs have long since been removed by evolution. That allowed the orca to become a more manageable size as mass was drawn away from its torso which was reshaping into a more humanoid frame. The head compacted as the neck became more defined. A more intelligent light appeared in the orca&#39;s remaining eye. Eventually, the orca was able to push himself up on his new limbs. His pale body was still covered with scars and he had a more weathered look from his many years. &quot;So, this is what limbs feel like,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hello,&quot; said Kumiko, &quot;I&#39;m-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I heard,&quot; said the orca, &quot;You&#39;re Kumiko and you want to be like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could understand us?&quot; asked Kumiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could hear you, but it didn&#39;t make any sense to me until just now,&quot; said the orca.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re not upset about leaving your pod?&quot; asked Kumiko.<br />
<br />
The orca shrugged and said, &quot;Mother died years ago, so everyone went their separate ways, joined new pods. I roamed from pod to pod, siring calves, had more than my fair share of fights. If Animalia can provide an easier way to live, I&#39;m not against joining it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re not against helping me join, are you?&quot; asked Kumiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would I have to do?&quot; asked the orca.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just need a little bit of your body fluid in me, like your saliva. We could-&quot; started Kumiko only for the orca to grab her leg and give it a small bite. &quot;Ow! I meant like a kiss!&quot; snapped Kumiko.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a kiss?&quot; asked the orca.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s when you touch lips and-&quot; started Kumiko before she felt warmth spreading from the bite. She looked down to see her leg getting bulkier, her toes started to stretch out into a flipper-like shape. Her other leg grew to match it. Already her legs felt strong enough to support her massive bust. Her back was another matter though. Then Kumiko felt the warmth extend into her spine, which started extending herself. But it wasn&#39;t just making her taller. Her spine was extending out of her body as her tail started to form. As her spine made her taller, her torso also got broader. Her arms also became longer and thicker as webbing appeared between her fingers. Despite her body getting bigger, Kumiko&#39;s breasts remained more or less the same size. The biggest difference was that her nipples were becoming a silvery color, which became more obvious as her clothes tore apart thanks to her expanding mass. Kumiko grimaced as her face started pushing out into a snout, her nostrils merging into one hole before being forced up her head. Her new dorsal fin extended out from the back of her head.<br />
<br />
When Kumiko was done changing, she was now an anthro orca. Though unlike other orca Animalians, her black parts were silvery grey. She was also quite a bit busty than other female orcas, but it was more proportionate to her new size than when she was human. Kumiko hefted up her breasts, no longer feeling quite so burdened. She would never be called &#39;petite&#39;, but she could now support herself without relying on wheelchairs or walkers. &quot;You have no idea how much of a relief this is,&quot; said Kumiko, &quot;I really owe you for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what was it about this &#39;kiss&#39; you mentioned?&quot; asked the orca. He might be an older male, but he was still mating with females before he got too worn. And becoming an Animalian awoke a new preference in him. Seeing Kumiko&#39;s shapely form soon encouraged his penis to emerge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll show you that and so much more,&quot; said Kumiko as she lied down on the beach, spreading her legs.<br />
<br />
The orca grinned and said, &quot;I&#39;ve had many females who&#39;d say I was a good lover. If they could talk, that is.&quot; He lowered himself over top of her and inserted himself into her vagina. The orca soon felt new vigor as he thrust into her. His scars were fading away as the nicks on his body filled up, his dorsal becoming whole again. His right eye socket puckered before eyelids regrew. Soon, they opened to reveal a restored eye. His old strength and vigor returned in spades as his muscles became more defined. Beneath him, Kumiko&#39;s muscles also grew larger as she grew a little taller. Her large breasts became even less of a burden as her back and pectoral muscles strengthened. Of course, she was more concerned about the orca bull that was filling her.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
It took some time before they were finished. After that, Kumiko named the orca &#39;Ningen&#39;, after the cryptid resembling a white bipedal whale that supposedly inhabits the antarctic oceans. (Author&#39;s note: I&#39;m not making this up, but this is a more recent product of Japanese folklore.) Ningen was quite pleased to join Animalia with his new mate. Though Animalians were a little more monogamous than he was used to, he didn&#39;t particularly mind. And thought Kumiyo was happy for her cousin, she was still waiting for Tyson to arrive at Heiya Island and hopefully become her mate too.</p>
