<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon&#39;s power to alter himself and to suck the life force out of others was very useful. <br />
<br />
The school wouldn&#39;t have a football team for several years once Simon drained the boys. But they were for the most part happy in their new life.<br />
<br />
Bobby happened onto a man in a leather jacket. It had several patches on it and the man stunk of sweat. He had a beard that looked as if it had never been shaved which was quite in contrast to Bobby&#39;s former life. He had been quite the preppy sort. He cut his hair nice and short, always shaved, wore the best name brand outfits and here he was drawn to this man that was the antithesis of what he had been.<br />
<br />
Soon Bobby was taken by Harley as his bitch. Harley wasn&#39;t just his name but also the bike he rode. He might have been a well built man at some point in his life but he now had quite the beer gut. Bobby grew his hair out long and as it got longer it became curly. He kept up his primping but this became more feminine in nature. His long hair made him look like a girl. His skinny legs and arms looked more feminine. And the outfits that Harley had Bobby dressing in made him look like a girl. He wore skirts and frilly tops. The only things that were to identify Bobby as a man were his dwindling cock and his lack of boobs. But Harley often thought about implants for that.<br />
<br />
Harley used Bobby often and when he went out Bobby was free trade for his buddies. But Bobby enjoyed this life. And he now had someone to control him.<br />
<br />
Ryan on the other hand was one of the few that resisted the change.<br />
<br />
The more he resisted being the twink that he now was the more he craved a dominant man to control him and that is what he got. It was the first time he had ever been in a gay bar. He flitted from man to man flirting with each and every one of them. In his mind he screamed out but what came from his mouth was a litany of sweet talk that he had no control over.<br />
<br />
Ryan had been the quarterback. He was use to being in control and now he had none.<br />
<br />
As he flitted from one to the next he was being observed by Phil. Phil watched him approaching man after man. He saw the retreats that Ryan would attempt and then head more forcefully into the flirtation.<br />
<br />
As Ryan made his way around the room he finally made his way to find Phil. Phil ignored Ryan&#39;s advances at first which made Ryan even more insistent to approach Phil.<br />
<br />
Phil grabbed Ryan by the hair. It wasn&#39;t long but long enough to hold onto. He was fairly muscular and easily held Ryan in place. He tore the t-shirt from Ryan&#39;s body exposing an almost pre pubescent body. Not an ounce of hair on his chest. He was as slim as possible almost approaching anorexic. <br />
<br />
Phil examined Ryan&#39;s body. Stroking his skinny arms and chest and even lifting him up and finding out that he had grape sized balls and a dwindling cock. A product of Simon&#39;s activities.<br />
<br />
He tossed Ryan to the floor and said loudly I don&#39;t think so.<br />
<br />
The rest of the night Ryan followed Phil around like a lost puppy dog. He had lost his interest in any of the other men and he needed Phil.<br />
<br />
As the night wore on Phil headed out the door to find Ryan follow him.<br />
<br />
What do you want?<br />
<br />
I want you sir. Ryan said regretting his words immediately.<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t want you.<br />
<br />
But I will do anything for you sir.<br />
<br />
No you  wont.<br />
<br />
Oh yes I will sir.<br />
<br />
I have seen your resistance you don&#39;t want me.<br />
<br />
I do sir please let me prove it to you. Ryan came closer and tried to unzip Phil&#39;s pants.<br />
<br />
Oh no you don&#39;t get that till I give it to you.<br />
<br />
Then how can I prove it to you?<br />
<br />
Phil opened the back of his car and told Ryan to get in.<br />
<br />
Phil got in the front and there was Ryan sitting in the back seat grinning like a fool.<br />
<br />
On the floor boy.<br />
<br />
As Phil drove home Ryan tried to speak but all Phil would say was silence. And Ryan would shut up.<br />
<br />
When they got in Phil told Ryan to strip and he did immediately.<br />
<br />
Phil went to another room and came back with a leather collar, fur lined with big rings around it. He put this on Ryan and threaded a thick chain through the rings and put a padlock on them and made Ryan swallow the key.<br />
<br />
That key will take quite awhile to pass through. At that time we will reevaluate.<br />
<br />
Phil took Ryan to a room that had a bolt in the floor and even though the chain was long he chained him to the bolt so that he had to kneel in front of a trough.<br />
<br />
Phil took out one of the largest dildo&#39;s Ryan had ever seen, stuck it in a can of crisco and shoved it unceremoniously up Ryan&#39;s asshole.<br />
<br />
Ryan squealed in pain but tried to not show Phil his pain.<br />
<br />
Soon Phil came back and dropped a bucket of slop in the trough and said eat.<br />
<br />
That was a lot of food but he started to pick up the food with his hands and eat.<br />
<br />
Look pig this ain&#39;t no dainty outfit you are a pig. Eat like a pig. Shove your face in there. I don&#39;t want to see you use your hands again.<br />
<br />
Ryan did as he was told.<br />
<br />
Phil sat in front of Ryan in an easy chair and pulled out his cock. It was a monster cock but what Ryan didn&#39;t know was that Phil liked to pump up his cock artificially and it got even bigger.<br />
<br />
You see you will have to take this up that ass of yours and I like a nice soft ass so we are going to fatten you up like a good sow and stretch that hole so you can accommodate me.<br />
<br />
Ryan had never had much fat on his body and his mind was screaming even more but the more his mind screamed the more he dug into that trough. He was stuffed but there was still quite a bit left in the trough and Phil said you need to finish that. You said you would prove to me that you wanted to do whatever I said and I want you to finish it.<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s tiny body was straining at the stress that was being pressed on his abdomen but he kept eating till it was all gone and he laid there on his back his stomach rising in the air.<br />
<br />
Good start.<br />
<br />
As the days, weeks and months passed Ryan grew fat and round. His man boobs grew huge and Phil would put a breast pump on them to enlarge them even more.<br />
<br />
It was more than a year when Ryan&#39;s belly reached the floor as he knelt over the trough and ate and that was the moment when Phil decided to finally fuck the boy. His ass was nice and supple and his asshole as wide open never to close.<br />
<br />
Ryan had found himself a dominant feeder and he was in hog heaven.</p>
