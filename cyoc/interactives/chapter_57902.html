<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A living statue of a five year old Lupman pup stepped out of the dinning room mirror, <br />
looking like it was stepping through the mirror and being covered in a film. For the older <br />
by years Lilly and Cassandra, Whitney and Maddex's pups, it was like they were being <br />
pulled through water standing on it's side. Their nineteenth century clothes vanishing as <br />
they did so. <br />
<br />
&quot;Will you two be okay?&quot; Abbey asked. <br />
<br />
The carnelian colored pups felt a little dizzy but replied almost together, &quot;We'll be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abbey hugged them and said, &quot;I'm sure your papa will tell all about the story later, I'll see <br />
you after the finale.&quot; And with that, Abbey stepped back through the mirror, not really <br />
thinking of how many days she had been in there listening to Marie-Eliza's story. <br />
<br />
Nor did Cassandra and Lilly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe we can't get to hear the end of story after listening to it for so long!&quot; Lilly <br />
lamented. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know it's just.... we should... maybe we should go watch TV.&quot; Cassandra said dully, and <br />
Lilly nodded limply. <br />
<br />
When Whitney saw her cubs, she didn't ask them where they had been all this time or <br />
where her husband was. Instead she merely smiled at them, hugged them good morning, <br />
and ushered them to the rest of the pups and cubs in the living room.  The carnelian twins <br />
not really feeling about talking about the witches story right now or wondering when their <br />
father would come out of the mirror.... <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Mal'Akh Bialyk had to ask, &quot;How do you know your dance only works on humans? Joy said <br />
so herself that she was mutated via your dance, and she is a lupman. Whose to say it <br />
doesn't effect Felmans, Dragons, Gargoyles, or Leomans?&quot; <br />
<br />
Martha started, no one had really asked that question, they had only just assumed. &quot;Well, <br />
there's something about all the leomans I've met that prevents their species from being <br />
changed, even by the game it can't seem to change their species, only turn them into art or <br />
a decidedly leoman shaped somethings. As to weather my dance would mutate leomans <br />
like my dance did Joy and Ingrid... I honestly don't know, and I doubt I'd find a leoman <br />
who'd wish to be the test subject of such a thing... as for dragons, I've never met one face <br />
to face so except maybe once I think in a formal manner and Felman I've again never <br />
danced for them so even if they are effected I've never been in a position to test it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well if your line is related to Twilight, I don't see why it wouldn't effect leomans or at least <br />
making them ... like you in that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well call ourselves Shiva Wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shiva?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A Hindu god often depicted as having multiple arms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And thank you for the warning. Even without the magic I've been told my dance is <br />
hypnotic, which is only amplified when the other omegas, other shiva wolves dance with <br />
me, even if it only lasts as long as the dance itself and doesn't allow me to implant any <br />
commands. Most still find it enjoyable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Joy and Ingrid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've heard them chatting among themselves when they don't think I'm listening, and by <br />
that I mean J, O, Y, In, Gr, and Id. They're still happy they got to see me dance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the way they are now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The way they are is simply natural to them now I guess, and the six of them are separate <br />
and unique entities even if three each shared the exact same childhood. I don't think they <br />
can comprehend being apart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Prime-Omega-Martha. It's nice to know you care about us.&quot; J said. <br />
<br />
Martha startled and her heads look in different directions seeing Joy and Ingrid on opposite <br />
sides of her. <br />
<br />
The twin nurses pointed at their ears, &quot;It's not very bright to have a conversaation you wish <br />
to be semi-private in a large open room with someone who had  two extra sets of ears <br />
with exceptional hearing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... right... I apologize if anything I said was gossip.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are our Prime Omega.&quot; J said. &quot;It's not our place to judge what you say as right or <br />
wrong.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ingrid's awake heads nodded. <br />
<br />
'And that's the wolf pack I know.' Mal'Akh thought, 'Some things don't change.' <br />
<br />
Bart considered the practical advantages of having multiple heads and multiple arms, from <br />
a purely business stand point, you'd be able to work on some jobs three time as fast. Bart <br />
didn't worry if his business partners would take him seriously, since it had nothing to do <br />
with age. <br />
<br />
 Jenny meanwhile considered the legal aspect, 'You'd have to write at least a dozen new <br />
laws just cover it all! Just imagine! 'I didn't take part in that crime! My other two heads <br />
forced me to do it!' Would all three heads have to fill out tax forums? I wonder if Ingrid and <br />
Joy do! Or does the pack pay taxes as a whole as a commune? I need to read up on that <br />
more.' <br />
<br />
Kevin meanwhile pulled on Mal'Akh's arm, &quot;So you were alive during the witch trials? Did <br />
you ever see a witch burned?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcy pulled on her other arm, &quot;What was it like during the civil war?&quot; She asked not <br />
knowing she was a couple centuries off, and she was still at the age where she thought <br />
world war one and the civil war were one and the same thing and had never even heard of <br />
the war of 1812 or the French-Indian Wars that set the stage for the American Revolution. <br />
<br />
Martha INSTANTLY took charge. &quot;Now now.&quot; Her head said in a very firm voice looking at <br />
both children, &quot;Don't shove her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We weren't shoving, we were pulling.&quot; Marcy defended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave the semantics to Alice please.&quot; Martha's head said cooly. <br />
<br />
Zack meanwhile felt a nudge on his arm. He turned his head, and saw Amy. He tried to <br />
huge her at once, but found his broken bones had a thing to say about that. Amy saw this, <br />
and hugged her father instead. <br />
<br />
&quot;Amy...I'm happy to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I'm happy to see you too papa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And... you're my Amy right? You're not some ancient spirit, some dead japanese priestess, <br />
or ... or... or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy hugged her father's arm, the only thing she could wrap around as things were. &quot;I am, <br />
always have been, and always will be your little princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we have enough princesses already dear.&quot; June said looking at Jenny, and thinking <br />
of Gretchen. <br />
<br />
&quot;One more won't hurt.&quot; Zack whispered happy to feel his daughter's body around his arm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you here dear?&quot; June asked her baby. <br />
<br />
&quot;A daughter needs  a reason to see her recovering father and mother?&quot; Amy smiled.   Hope <br />
and Grace felt a tiny bit envious of June. <br />
<br />
Amy just smiled to herself, after everything that had happened, all the crying she had done <br />
for those who couldn't cry for themselves or had no one to cry for them, she needed them. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity and Chief Gillie stepped into City Hall. Madam Serenity noted first how the <br />
doors seemed much bigger than she remembered, and the place gave off the slightest hint <br />
of a scent she couldn't identify.  <br />
<br />
And when they stepped inside... Gillie felt like she was going to have a heart attack. Madam <br />
Serenity managed to take it a lot more in stride all things considered. <br />
<br />
Naked lion women. All bald.<br />
<br />
Brandi had of course chatted happily with her work mates and bridge partners spreading <br />
the cascade to the rest of the city Hall staff. <br />
<br />
Now the security for city hall were nine foot tall naked (except for their security gear)  lion <br />
women. All standing at attention, all in a room whose ceiling was now much much higher, <br />
and all smiling and turned their heads when Gillie entered and one or two even waved at <br />
her like they had been friends for years. <br />
<br />
Gillie felt sick inside as she saw some of the paintings on the walls had also become those <br />
of naked lion people. She knew it was just reality not allowing for all inconsistencies, but <br />
that didn't make her feel better. <br />
<br />
Gillie wondered what these lion women's names had been before they had become women.  <br />
Gillie however did spot the Janitor ... now a lion person, but still male... and she saw some <br />
of the lion women smiling at him and starting at the thing between his legs. And she saw <br />
other civil grunts and middle men who were still men if now furry and nude. The cascade <br />
had had days to fully transform the city hall staff. <br />
<br />
While Gillie was just twisted on the inside, Madam Serenity remembered what was said <br />
about lion's naturally having a very large different in female to male ratio.  Madam Serenity <br />
correctly surmised the vast majority of gender changes to the wolves was purely due to <br />
Jensen when he remembered being Jenny being a pervert (and Kaylee when she <br />
remembered being Kyle doing her hardest to please him).  But here she figured it had to do <br />
with lions in the wild having a ratio of five to six females to one or two males. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think it could have gotten this bad this fast.&quot; Gillie muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to compound interest.&quot; Madam Serenity said. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Sandi and her half-sister Catherine, and their half brother Aaron, were now <br />
both proud members of the lion-people 'nudist colony' that continued to grow at a <br />
growing rate.  <br />
<br />
Sandi and Catherine put on their school uniforms as was normal with a private school... <br />
just because they were leoman didn't mean they could ignore that base rule. Though now <br />
they had special sandals for their paws and holes in their skirts for their tails and of course <br />
they were sizes bigger for the larger leoman cubs. <br />
<br />
Of course the uniforms itched a little, but they got used to it soon enough and built up a <br />
resistance. <br />
<br />
Once at school the girls chatted with the other lasses at the private school. The ones who <br />
weren't sociopaths in training transformed quickly enough, destine to spread it to their <br />
families, or the ones who loved them at least, there would be a number of more recorded <br />
adoptions in a few days. <br />
<br />
Leomans normally gave birth to litters. The fact singular births were so overwhelmingly <br />
common in Glendale and other parts of the country had been attributed to the curse. This <br />
was fantasy, but the curse made a good scapegoat. Criminals had realized this a while ago, <br />
and cons with PRETENDING to have the power of the game was relatively common, and of <br />
course didn't set off Madam Serenity's sixth sense. <br />
<br />
Sandi and Catherine talked with the other girls at the private school... not even seeing as <br />
their hair the key vanity of many a little girl just up and vanished with no blinking an <br />
eyelash, those with dyed hair ended up dyed fur instead (expensive, but well worth it to <br />
these girls).  The chairs all changed to allow for tails, and Sandi and Catherine's 'special' <br />
uniforms were quickly becoming standard. <br />
<br />
There were of course special outfit for Gym too of course, but these were quickly becoming <br />
purely optional to the leoman students, those who did wear them did it mostly for the <br />
sake of maintaining the sense of a learning environment. <br />
<br />
Hair clips stayed, but keeping them on become more of a hassle. <br />
<br />
One girl, named Rika, twelve years old, who had been a friend of a friend of Sandi's and <br />
Catherine, who dyed her entire fur purple with sparkles this week (last week it was red <br />
white and blue without sparkles).  Stayed behind after class to add her two cents of <br />
cleaning up the room of her own free will! Her teacher always appreciated this, and <br />
admired her, even if he wondered about her sometimes.  When she was done, and her <br />
teacher thanked her, she turned her back to him, and took a package out of her backpack. <br />
<br />
The little girl put the package on his desk and ran out before he saw it. He wondered why <br />
she hadn't said good bye as normal. And the teacher saw the package, and wondered what <br />
it was about. It wasn't his birthday. He opened the package and found a locket, kind of <br />
expensive too. He wasn't quite sure what it meant. But if it was from Rika he wouldn't <br />
reject it, that would been rude to his student when she had clearly put a lot of effort into it.  <br />
The teacher put it around his neck, in a few minutes, it was the only thing he was wearing. <br />
<br />
And that was how the cascade entered the teacher population. the gym teacher was the <br />
only one whose gender changed, but thought no one knew it, she was just as much a strict <br />
but kind taskmaster as in the old reality. <br />
<br />
Somewhere deep within her, Gillie still hoped that the leoman cascade would fade when <br />
the game was gone. If she had more experience with magic, maybe she'd hope that when <br />
the game was gone, the uber concentration of magic in Glendale would dissipate to the <br />
rest o the globe, thus robbing the leoman cascade of the massive amounts of magic <br />
needed to feed it. Or perhaps, she also desperate hoped, that the Leoman cascade would <br />
not, and could not spread beyond Glendale's borders. <br />
<br />
But there was a vector Gillie hadn't considered. The internet. Of course the vast, vast, VAST <br />
majority of people online didn't consider each other friends in the real sense of the term, <br />
even if they thought they did. But by sheer law of average, the few true REAL friends on the <br />
internet had already caused the leoman cascade to appear in New York, San Francisco, <br />
Britain, and Germany. This happened normally with voice chat. <br />
<br />
The Amish population of course, stayed totally human, not only did they not connected <br />
with the internet, they also kept mostly to themselves, and thus were HIGHLY unlikely to <br />
form a die-hard true-blue friendship, or a romantic relationship, with outsiders. It seemed <br />
Madam Serenity might not end up the last human on Earth after all in theory... <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Gillie.&quot; Waved the mayor's secretary. <br />
<br />
Gillie saw the name  the lion woman on the desk, and repeated the name and waved back <br />
at her not to be rude, that would be uncivilized. Gillie internally groaned, 'Great, now my <br />
instincts betray me...' <br />
<br />
At this point, neither was really shocked when they saw the giant lionman behind the desk. <br />
Gillie was SO SO GLADE, and was actually thanking God in Heaven that the desk hide his <br />
lower half. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello and Good morning.&quot; Said the Mayor in a perfectly polite voice. <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity noticed first the photo on his desk of the leoman and three bald lion <br />
women and a cub in front of each. She considered asking about it, but knew it had nothing <br />
to do with what she had come here for. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Mayor... I am Madam Serenity... a cure for the game has been found.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Mayor shuddered, his eyes went wide, and a expression that dared to hope. &quot;Tell me <br />
more... and do not leave out a single detail!&quot; <br />
<br />
He clinked on an intercom, &quot;Brandi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cancel my other meetings, I think I'm going to be busy today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza was sorry to see Cassandra and Lilly go, they had been good company. <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza spoke her mother holding her shoulders. Due to their mental link, Marie-Eliza <br />
practically spoke for both of them. Eliza rarely having something separate to say.  <br />
<br />
Abbey came back a few minutes later, Lilly and Cassandra slipping out of the context in <br />
their minds. Abbey evened out the wrinkles in her blue apron and white dress and sat next <br />
to her half-sisters/cousins, once again perfectly entranced by Marie-Eliza's story. <br />
<br />
The reflective blond furred and glass blue eyed witchling collected herself. Folding out the <br />
wrinkles in her black dress with red runes she spoke. &quot;The witches of course practically <br />
spat in the face of the offer of Father Draco Fire to give them a last confession. After all, <br />
the witches were the heroes, the hunters were evil, and the witches were rebelling against <br />
a jealous vengeful God and the unfair world made by Him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza made a sharp, ironic, harsh, and lamentive laugh, &quot;The sick joke is by aiding <br />
'Free' the witches would have been executed anyway if they had been lobotomized of their <br />
magic and gotten into the hands of slave owners. The south took a very, very, VERY dim <br />
view of anyone who aided run away slaves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ironically, some not ALL methods of identifying witches involved torture or dying weather <br />
you were found innocent or not, but they make for less entertaining drama so aren't <br />
covered much in documentaries. <br />
<br />
Ever heard of the Lord's Prayer test? It was practiced in Europe during the Inquisition's <br />
time, though the Inquisition itself found witchcraft an absurdity. The base idea was that if <br />
a witch could say the Lord's Prayer without a mistake, or screaming in agony, they logically <br />
couldn't be a witch since the devil wouldn't allow someone loyal to him to recite holy <br />
words. <br />
<br />
The other was 'The Witch Cake' you make a cake with the urine of the witch's victims, and <br />
feed it to a dog. If the witch felt pain when the dog ate the cake, they were a witch.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear!&quot; Eliza said, being the one to interrupting the story for once, &quot;You're going off track.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH!&quot; Marie-Eliza realized, &quot;Sorry. <br />
<br />
&quot;They didn't really have time to build a Gallows, so they'd use a tree instead... one that was <br />
NOT loyal to the witches like the Boxing Trees that circled the city. In their haste to get it <br />
over with, they'd pick a tree near where the witches' rune experiment blew up in their <br />
faces, weather this aided the witches in placing their last curse or not, even I don't know.  <br />
What I do know is that the 'trick of fate' that makes that no one interrupts a game of <br />
'transform of dare' once it's begun was also established at that point.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sister Marie Cruz wanted their execution done humanely, using methods again she had <br />
cheated with her sixth sense in knowing. But Lewis, and Father Draco, wanted the <br />
execution done as quickly as possible and didn't want to risk waiting for Marie Cruz to <br />
figure out the witches weight (which they would have lied about anyway) and height, and <br />
figured out the mathematics for the proper length of rope and drop height to kill them <br />
instantly by the drop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddex's heads said, &quot;That came back to bite them, Glendale, and all of us in the tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza shook her head, &quot;Not quite. The witches would have been able to get their <br />
curse across either way.&quot;</p>
