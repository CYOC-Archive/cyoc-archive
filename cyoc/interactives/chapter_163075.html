<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob and his mother had planned a lovely outing for just the two of them. Hiking in the hills behind their neighborhood, they saw it as a tranquil activity for them to enjoy together. However, Jacob wasn&#39;t enjoying it as much as he&#39;d like. His mother being an attractive woman, she was unaware her own feminine vibes worked on her son. With a curvy and mature body, Jacob thought she looked sexy; even moreso, with her clad in a sports bra smooshing her E cups, and short shorts hugging her large butt, showing off her shapely legs with sexy feet wearing sandals. He found himself fantasizing about her often lately, and regretted going on this outing. Though, he didn&#39;t want to disappoint her, and reluctantly agreed.<br />
<br />
Everything was going relatively fine, with both far from exhausted, and Jacob keeping his libido in check with the scenery. That was, until out of the blue when he heard his mother scream from farther ahead. Sprinting in a panic, Jacob was just in time to see his mother being pulled toward the exoskeleton of a Fuckbug. &quot;Mom!&quot; He shouted, just as her arms were pulled inside along with her head. &quot;Run away honey!&quot; She shouted, before losing control of her mouth. However, her lower half was still free, with her legs out and flailing. It seemed to disrupt the Fuckbug enough, that it couldn&#39;t secure that part of her body. Pulling out a survival knife, Jacob went around the bug, cutting at it&#39;s midsection. Enough slashes weakened it&#39;s body, until the front quarter of it&#39;s body, still containing the upper portion of his mother fell away from the rest of it.<br />
<br />
The severed back portion twitched for a bit for falling lifeless. Jacob took it as a good sign and looked toward the front half. Unfortunately, this portion still remained alive. The open wound regenerating over and closing up, melding with the flesh of his mother&#39;s back. &quot;Mom!&quot; He called one last time, seeing her lips and breasts expand, with the latter tearing through the sports bra. Surprisingly enough, her hips and ass also expanded along with her pussy, ripping through her shorts and panties. Jacob knew his mother was now gone, as he surveyed the damage. Her oversexed body seemed mostly intact, with the remaining part of the Fuckbug having assimilating the upper portion of her head and arms, so that it just looked like she was wearing a hood melded to her body. <br />
<br />
Taking control of the nervous system, the Fuckbug unsteadily rises to her feet, finding her huge tits and ass helped balance her out. And sure enough, she noticed Jacob right away, and began producing pheromones to coax him in for coitus. The pheromones may not have a scent, but they were being chemically produced so that only his body would react to them; as such, his erection was straining to escape. Jacob hesitated; this thing just erased his mother from existence, and was using what was left of her for it&#39;s own sexual ventures. Not to mention, it was aiming for her son since he was the only male around. But, the other half of Jacob&#39;s brain tried to reason, &quot;If I didn&#39;t fuck it, it might go after another stranger. I can&#39;t let this thing abuse mom&#39;s body like that; plus, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d rather screw me than a random guy. Guess it&#39;s decided.&quot; He concluded. <br />
<br />
Stepping over to his Fuckbug mom, Jacob grabbed her K cup tits and made out with her oversized lips. Staring up into the inhuman eyes of the Fuckbug, it was sort of a turn on for Jacob. He was about to lose his virginity to his mother, and an animal, at the same time. &quot;Well, might as well start.&quot; He proclaimed, helping the Fuckbug onto her back, as she spread her luscious legs. Her plump pussy was leaking juices, eager to mate with a male for life. Jacob, however, was in a state of awe; the pussy he came out of decades prior is about to become sole property of his dick exclusively. This Fuckbug will walk around with his mother&#39;s body, womb full of her son&#39;s cum, from now on.<br />
<br />
Finally, he took the long awaited plunge, sticking his entire length into the mature cunt, feeling it tighten up immensely. Rumor has it that Fuckbugs have greater control over their pussies than their victims did, and Jacob definitely believed it. His mother&#39;s pussy seemed desperate for him to move, so he began thrusting. Rocking back and forth caused the Fuckbug&#39;s assets to jiggle furiously, so he grabbed at her tits and placed both her nipples in his mouth. As if to further ruin the normal image he had of his mother, the Fuckbug moaned from the ecstasy, using her voice. It helped Jacob feel he was finally giving her the pleasure she always wanted, just under the control of this insect from now on.<br />
<br />
Wrapping her legs around his back, the Fuckbug was making certain her mate would only cum inside her womb. And that was just what Jacob planned to do. Minutes of incestuous arthropod fucking pass, with both lost in the ecstasy of their mate&#39;s embrace. Poking the entrance to her cervix, Jacob knew the Fuckbug was ready for his seed. Both climaxing together, the Fuckbug&#39;s cunt tightened to milk Jacob for all the cum he could give, as he shot all his warmth into her womb. The two collapsed in the afterglow for a bit, spasming from ministrations. After a while, Jacob pulled out and got redressed, placing an arm around his Fuckbug mother. Feeling on her back where her smooth skin was fused to the warm exoskeleton, he tickled the nape of the Fuckbug&#39;s neck area. It laughed sweetly, meaning she was still ticklish like his mom. &quot;Well, let&#39;s go home, honey.&quot; Jacob told his new mate for life, directing the nude oversexed milf insect back to his house, where the two fucked for the rest of the day.</p>
