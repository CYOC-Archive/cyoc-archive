<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up the next morning feeling great, and enjoying the feeling of the sheets caressing your hard naked body. Ronnie must have slipped out earlier to make it to his first class. Part of what you loved so much about him was his dedication to his studies. Your loving memories of him were becoming stronger than your old memories... it felt like your brain was coated in a thin haze, every thought feels like more effort than you remember. You stretch your arms wide and your new American pride tattoo on your left bicep catches your eye. You thought it was just one red, white and blue star, but now you notice two more similar stars. Did more tattoos appear overnight? They must have just faded in after you stepped away from the mirror last night and not noticed until now.<br />
<br />
You get out of bed and search for some clothing. You pull designer underwear over your huge cock (wow, even bigger than you remember) and then some simple jeans and a plain blue t-shirt, favouring simple but form-fitting clothes that showed off your physique. Your day goes pretty much as usual, attempting your first class of the day (Introduction to Politics) but finding it incredibly difficult to stay focused. Even more so than yesterday, this version of you seems to really struggle with thinking about much of anything. You give up after that lesson and head to the gym before swim practice in the afternoon. You were never much of a swimmer but the feeling of water against your bare skin as you race across the pool, and the time spent getting to watch the other attractive men on your team in their speedos leads to one of the most enjoyable afternoons you can remember. When you return to your room Ronnie is there, and you notice it looks like he has dyed the front of his hair a lighter colour, leaving his hair almost blonde in contrast to the rest of his red hair. You don&#39;t have time to question him on it before he is pulling you into a kiss and you repeat the bliss of last night.<br />
<br />
A few more days pass just like this: attempting class, giving up, gym, swim practice, fucking Ronnie. But with each passing day it seems harder and harder to focus on anything other than this basic routine, as the fog in your brain seems to intensify. You notice your tattoo changing as well, and there is now a full American flag next to the three stars. Over the three days, Ronnie finishes dying his hair, leaving no trace of the redhead and going full twink blonde. On the fourth day, you wake up and feel the clouds in your mind stronger than ever. Basic thoughts are very difficult, and you notice for the first time Ronnie hasn&#39;t left for class before you wake up. He is sitting next to your bed, watching you with a studious eye. &quot;We need to talk&quot; he says. &quot;Why we need talk?&quot; you reply in your American voice. Was that right? Words are hard, you realize. Ronnie continues: &quot;I think as the days go on the last beans we took are intensifying. Have you noticed my hair? It&#39;s blonde? And I think I&#39;m getting shorter as well.&quot; He stands up and beckons you to stand next to him. You see what he means, four days ago he was as tall as your shoulders, now he only came up to your nipples. &quot;Aww, cute Ronnie&quot; you say as you grab his ass and try to pull him into a kiss. Wow, was his ass larger too? &quot;No, no Sam stop!&quot; He pushes you off. &quot;You&#39;re still changing too! Look at your tattoo, and you must have noticed that your dick is even bigger. And you&#39;re barely forming full sentences&quot; You knew you had a big dick, and you loved it. Why was bigger a bad thing? &quot;I talk good. And you like big dick.&quot; You smile dopily and press your semi-hard cock up against Ronnie&#39;s thigh. He just sighs, apparently upset but you can&#39;t understand why. Ronnie goes to his desk and reaches into the drawer where he stashed the jellybeans. He digs around for a moment and pulls out two, placing one in your hand. It was purple with some squiggly black lines through it. &quot;I think we need to keep eating beans until we are back to normal. This week has been great but... we can&#39;t keep this up!&quot; He looked scared. You didn&#39;t want to see him so upset. &quot;Okay.. we eat beans&quot; you say gloomily. Hopefully you won&#39;t change too much, you think as you put the bean in your mouth and start to chew. Ronnie does the same with his bean.<br />
<br />
Immediately the clouds start to clear from your brain and your thoughts start to come back into focus. Wow... you were really far gone into stupidity. You can&#39;t believe how dense you have been these last few days. This bean must be increasing your intelligence. While your thoughts are clearing, your vision is becoming blurry. At first it is just minor but soon it becomes impossible to see anything in front of you. You fumble around for a minute before you feel a pair of glasses next to you on the bed and put them on, allowing you to see clearly again just in time to watch your monstrous cock start to retract back into your body until it is merely large, but in more normal proportions. Now you look at Ronnie and see him doubled over in pain on the floor. His body is pulsing as his puny muscles start to swell in waves. Swelling and swelling until they are larger even than yours. His ass deflates just a bit, looking firm and muscular instead of its former plump bounciness. While you were built tall and lean, Ronnie was still short but now built heavily with muscle, giving him a thick and stocky look, sort&#39;ve like a gymnast or wrestler&#39;s build. You stand and go to the bathroom to check if there are any more changes to your body. You are now wearing thick but trendy looking black glasses, and thankfully your physique hasn&#39;t changed at all. Your face however is looking different, not drastically so but just... plainer. Your formerly sharp looks have softened, your nose looks a bit more crooked than before, and there is a smattering of freckles across your cheeks. You smile and notice your formerly perfect teeth are now a messy jumble in your mouth. Your hair has also changed, getting a bit curlier and longer on the sides so that your neat quiff has become a messy mop on your head. The colour has darkened from blonde into a basic light brown, and your body is no longer shaved smooth but instead there is a smattering of brown hair on your arms, legs and chest. Your pubes are also much thicker and curlier so you&#39;re apparently not into manscaping. You are clearly not as concerned with your looks in this reality, even if your body is still beautiful.<br />
<br />
You return to the room, where Ronnie is collecting himself off the floor. &quot;I chose a green bean, so I think we can assume green means muscle.&quot; He flexes his massive arms and smiles. &quot;I hoped your brainy looking bean would make you less, you know... stupid.&quot; You look around the room and see that nothing much has changed, but your swimming posters have disappeared leaving your side of the room simple and sparse. You see what new memories flow in. Still 19, still American, still gay and dating Ronnie. But no longer a swimmer. You&#39;re a successful physics major, so you don&#39;t have time for sports. You do squeeze in time for the gym however, to keep your body and mind both sharp. You open your wardrobe and groan. Your designer clothes have been replaced with tired looking, basic clothing. You pull on some jeans and a jumper, but all your clothes are slightly baggy and worn down. Looking in the mirror, it would be hard to tell what physique you are hiding underneath your basic, baggy clothing. People must just consider you a nerd without realizing there is a stud hiding underneath. &quot;So if the beans just get worse over time, what are we going to do? How do we stop them from changing us?&quot; You and Ronnie ponder your question for a bit, but what do you do next?</p>
