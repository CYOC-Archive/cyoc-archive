<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dana looked in the mirror, and was disgusted by the succubus she saw.  Starring back at her was, she thought, the most evil thing she had ever seen.  A perversion of her former self, a being with no morals, no capacity for love or any redeeming qualities.  As her anger built up, she found self control harder to maintain.  Eventually, she couldn't take it any longer, and punched the mirror.  Not a smart move on my part, she thought, as blood spurt from her knuckles.  The wounds healed quickly, but the rage remained, and as she realized there was nothing she could do about it, she sunk her head in sorrow.  Tears streamed down her face, dripping into the sink as if from a waterfall.  As they swilled down the drain, she noticed they had changed color, becomming a dirty black, as though they were full of soot.  This just made her even more depressed, and she sunk her head over the sink in shame.  Suddenly, she felt what she thought was a hand on her shoulder.  Had someone come into the bathroom and discovered her?  In a panic, she raised her hand up to swat the offending hand away, until she realized it was comming from the mirror.  Now that just wasn't right.  She looked up, and saw that her reflection was reaching out of the mirror to comfort her.  Not only that, but it started to speak.

"Why do you fear these changes so, my love?"  The succubus in the mirror asked.

"They're not me!"  She wailed.  "I'm not some evil demon!"

"Neither am I."  Replied her reflection.  "But we are demons, and that's not gonna change.  The only thing we can do now is make sure Astara doesn't get her way.  We can't let that bitch run roughshot over us!"

Dana clasped her hand into a fist.  Who did Astara think she was, going around calling herself a princess?  This is America!  We don't have princesses!  But she did seem to have enough power to destroy the planet if she wanted, so Dana didn't see a lot she could do to stop her.

"What are we gonna do about it?"  Dana asked.  "I may be just like her now, but I'm not nearly as strong!"

"Maybe not."  Her reflection replied, "But she's still a succubus.  Bound by the same laws all succubi are bound to follow.  You are the one who summoned her, so she has to serve you, right?"

"I doubt she'll agree."  Dana opined.

"She has to.  It's in the code."  The reflection answered.  Dana realized she was right.  Back when she was still Dan, and she was in the basement, she read the entire demon summoning catalogue from cover to cover.  She had paid more attention to the succubus section of the catalogue than any of her classes, since it was so chock full of sex.  Before he put his palm to the succubus picture that had sealed his fate, he had read a certain section that now would come in handy, pertaining to the laws of succubus society.

1) A succubus is both master and slave.

2) The summoner is both servant and lord.

3) Whatever a succubus does must be done with permission of the master, and vice versa.

4) If the master becomes a succubus at the hands of his familiar, the laws still apply.  

5) If there be a dispute between master and servant, the stronger of the two wills will prevail.

6) The stronger the will, the stronger the succubus.  

7) Willpower can be increased by giving in to one's emotions and desires.  But this runs the risk of corrupting the will from its original purpose.  One must maintain a balance of discipline and abandon.

8) Power is manifest in beauty.  The more exotic the succubus, the stronger she is.

9) The stronger the succubus is, the larger her army.  

10) The looser in any conflict will become subservient until the time at which she builds back up her power.

With this knowledge in mind, Dana the succubus looked back up to the mirror, and let a small smile cross her features.

"So now do you see?"  The reflection asked.  "Astara is limited by her relationship to you.  She's hoping to build an army to crush you.  You must take control!  And in order to do that, you have to let the change finish!"

"Alright, alright!"  Dana groaned.  "Just tell me what I have to do."

"Enjoy yourself, that's all."  The reflection replied.  "The more you enjoy yourself, the more powerful you will become!"

Dana looked down at her groin, and realized what the reflection meant.  She pulled her pants and thong off, and slipped her fingers into her quivering vagina.  Immediately a wave of heat emanated out of her body, locking the bathroom so that nobody else could get in.  She was by herself, and had all the time in the world.  She began to relax, and the changes accelerate.  Her aching feet burst into black talons, with retractable claws and an extra opposable toe on each heel.  Her horns erupted out of her forehead, sheathed in a black cuticle.  Her canine teeth sharpened and elongated into venomous fangs, dripping a black aphrodisiac with the power to mutate those whose veins it coursed through, turning them into more succubi.  She let one hand come up to her gigantic G-cup breasts, and pinch and roll the nipple with her black, clawlike nails.  Her tongue snaked out of her mouth, elongating as the septum in the tip tore apart, forking it.  Her tail slithered into her vagina, freeing her other hand to touch the other breast.  She could feel Astara's telepathic influence trying to penetrate the bathroom to see what was taking Dana so long, but Dana's rapidly expanding power pushed it back.  Her tongue snaked down between her breasts, coiling around them.  It teased and tickled the left nipple, causing black milk to lactate from it.  She tasted herself, and the aphrodisiac effect of the milk drove her lust even higher.  She began to moan in pleasure, and as she did, her eyelashes began to elongate.  They became three inches long, and as she fluttered them, she felt like the most beautiful thing in existence.  Her ears became pointy and elf like, arousing her even further.  The red in her eyes completely filled her irises, erasing the last of her humanity.  Her pupils became catlike slits, giving her a bestial appearance.  But though she was a succubus in form and in mind, her morals remained intact.  She knew that if Astara had her way, the world would bow before her or be destroyed.  She planned on stopping her, but not before she had finished her job here.  As she writhed in ecstasy through her ministrations, her body began emmitting heat that warped the room around her.  The commodes and stalls melted away, and the whole area became coated by the shimmering substance of the mirror.  All she could see was herself, and she used this opportunity to modify the transformation to suit her needs.  Her lips and eyelids became black, coated with shimmering makeup.  Her eyelashes became studded with perls, and a constellation of red gems appeared on her temples.  Her navel became pierced, with a single red ruby covering it.  Her ears were bedecked with numerous gold earrings, and a red tongue stud stabbed its way through her blackening forked tongue.  Her skin turned bright red, and her labia and nipples became black.  She winced in pain as swirling black tattoos covered her body, and rubies pierced her nipples, clitoris and cheeks.  Spikes began to puncture through the mucosa of her vaginal canal, and her labia quivered as small black lumps appeared on it.  These lumps began to stretch and stretch, until they were eight black squid tentacles with red suction cups studded with black fangs.  They had red spikes and red tattoos all over them, and she blushed as they pushed their way into all of her orifices.  They oozed black slime into her body, and she climaxed again and again and again.  Her hair turned black, and grew down to the upper edge of her pelvis.  Finally, she had one more earth-shattering orgasm, and screamed so loudly and lustily that she thought every human being on the planet could hear her.  Fortunately they couldn't, because the room she was in prevented any sound or thought from escaping.  She opened her eyes again, but her sclera were not black like Astara's hateful orbs.  They were as white as a normal human being's, full of determination to let "Princess" Astara know what her place in the world would be.  They beheld her wondrous new form, and as they exalted, her reflection moved toward her.  The two identical succubi embraced in a passionate kiss, as their tails slithered into each other's sex.  

"Now that you see what you're capable of, are you ready to go reckon with her?"  The reflection asked, telepathically so that she wouldn't have to break her kiss.

"Definitely!"  The reborn Dana said.  "But first, let's you and me lay together for a little while longer.  I'd hate to waste this opportunity."

"My pleasure!"  The reflection replied, and increased her ministrations.  Unbeknownst to Dana, she was working her own powers on the mirrored surface of the room, causing more and more of her kind to appear and join in on the sexual frenzy.  Dana was going to need all the help she could get for the coming struggle, and as she enjoyed the orgy, she prepared herself to teach Astara what being a Princess really meant.</p>
