<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Nate and Eric Anderson left their house, Nate found a private spot to strip and release his inner werewolf. With clothes in hand, Nate then walked over the hill behind their place to visit his boyfriend Alex Ramsey while Eric, still in his human form at the moment, almost set a new speed record running to go see his girlfriend Cassie O&#39;Sullivan.<br />
<br />
Within his own lupine fursona, Alex laid in the grass of his unfenced backyard behind the Ramsey house, staring up at the stars, when his view was blocked by the handsome werewolf before him.<br />
However, he was getting conflicting vibes from his boyfriend. Nate&#39;s wolfy red rocket was peeking out of its sheath happy to see Alex, yet there was an unhappy look on his lover&#39;s muzzle.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up Stud?&quot; asked Alex, using his pet nickname for Nate, even as he sat up and gave the bulging tip of the penis before him a quick lick.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; admitted Nate, even as he shivered in pleasure at his lover&#39;s touch. &quot;Mom&#39;s invited a guest  over for dinner Friday night.&quot;<br />
&quot;So?&quot; asked Alex, uncertain what the issue was, even as he orally teased Nate&#39;s member some more.<br />
&quot;Mom said she wanted the lady to meet the family, because she&#39;s considering offering her room at the house as a <i>boarder</i>.&quot;<br />
&quot;The way you said that last word makes me think you think there&#39;s more to the story than that,&quot; said Alex, momentarily forgetting the tasty treat before him.<br />
&quot;Have you ever heard of a lady named Coach Katherine Johnson?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve obviously never had a class with her, but she teaches Girls&#39; Gym at the middle school. From what I hear, she&#39;s a lesbian weretigress, but above reproach. Won Teacher of the Year at least once that I&#39;m aware of and never does anything with anyone at the school, even if they&#39;re legal*.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, guess who&#39;s coming to dinner,&quot; said Nate, as he sat down next to his boyfriend.<br />
&quot;So? It&#39;s not like it&#39;s the end of the world. Sooner or later, your mom was probably going to find someone and move on with her life,&quot; pointed out Alex.<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t think it&#39;s too soon?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a judgement call at best, but considering how your mom cried and moaned over losing her husband and your father for the first month or so after his funeral and his murderer&#39;s trial...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, but another woman?&quot; asked Nate, staring at his paws.<br />
&quot;Is that what&#39;s bothering you? That your mom&#39;s next date might be with a woman? After all, you accept she&#39;s bi just as much she accepts you&#39;re gay,&quot; pointed out Alex, before kissing Nate on the muzzle.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; admitted Nate, shaking his head negatively after the kiss. &quot;I want her to be happy, but...&quot;<br />
&quot;People, even weres, grieve in different ways. Some, like the were-mers and the werefoxes would grieve for months, if not years, because they mate for life. But is the fact that your mom&#39;s on the verge of moving on what&#39;s truly bothering you, or is it the fact that you&#39;re probably not prepared to do so yet?&quot;<br />
&quot;I still miss him,&quot; admitted Nate. &quot;He had just accepted the fact that I&#39;m gay, let alone in love with you. He had just started adjusting to being a werefox, let alone mom becoming a werecat and finally acknowledging her bi side, then Yvette...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know Nate. I know,&quot; said Alex, who moved closer to his boyfriend and lovingly wrapped his furry arms around him.<br />
Nate leaned his head on Alex&#39;s shoulder and sighed, then the two of them just sat in the grass together for a long time.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
When Eric, still fully dressed and human, reached Cassie O&#39;Sullivan&#39;s unfenced backyard, he saw the beautiful girl of his life sitting alone on her back porch.<br />
Whether as a 14 year old red head with green eyes and a slight smattering of freckles, or as a russet furred she-wolf, Eric felt stirrings in both his heart and lower extremity whenever he saw her.<br />
&quot;Am I over dressed?&quot; he asked casually, as he started to take off his coat. Since becoming a werewolf himself, Eric didn&#39;t feel the cold as badly as he used to, but was used to wearing it and didn&#39;t think twice about putting the coat on before leaving the house.<br />
&quot;No. You&#39;re fine,&quot; said Cassie, looking up at him. The fact that the bulge in Eric&#39;s pants was currently at eye level with her was not lost on the she-wolf, but Cassie had other things on her mind. &quot;It&#39;s just that sometimes being furry helps me think better.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? About what?&quot; Eric asked, as he sat down next to his girlfriend.<br />
&quot;I think mom&#39;s seeing someone.&quot;<br />
&quot;Your&#39;s too?&quot; asked Eric, before telling her about the unexpected dinner plans with Coach Katherine Johnson Friday night.<br />
&quot;I had her for all my gym classes between sixth through eighth grade. She&#39;s a good person, so you have nothing to worry about. But I know nothing about whoever my mom&#39;s seeing except it&#39;s a male wolf**.&quot;<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
&quot;When I came home, mom was in the kitchen fixing dinner, but it was obvious she had just gotten out of the shower. All she was wearing were her underwear, her bathrobe, house slippers, and a towel around her head,&quot; explained Cassie. &quot;I couldn&#39;t tell who, but I still detected a good whiff of a male werewolf on her, and she was still emitting some pheromones, indicating either she&#39;s already had sex today or was seriously thinking about having sex with that werewolf.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Eric, while putting an arm around Cassie. &quot;Is this a bad thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Mom&#39;s been pretty... quiet ever since dad was killed by that drunk driver. It got to the point where she would only attend pack meetings just long enough for the formalities and pack business, then she would leave before things got hot and heavy. Now...&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, it has been a long time for your mother. Maybe it&#39;s time for her to move on, and you too,&quot; suggested Eric. &quot;I&#39;m just uncertain how I feel about my mom suddenly having an interest in someone again.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe you should take your own advice,&quot; suggested Cassie.<br />
&quot;Been giving it some serious thought ever since mom made that announcement about Johnson coming over for dinner Friday night. I&#39;d have no problem with her doing so eventually, but just three months shy of losing dad? Especially since she&#39;s just completing the end of her first trimester being pregnant with my new sister.&quot;<br />
&quot;I guess no matter when they do it, we&#39;d have a hard time adjusting to our moms moving on again,&quot; realized Cassie.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; conceded Eric. &quot;They say the only constant in life is change.&quot;<br />
&quot;Speaking of which, why don&#39;t you get out of those confining clothes and change so we can have some fun,&quot; suggested Cassie, even as she opened Eric&#39;s zipper and inserted a paw inside his pants to start massaging his rapidly hardening penis.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Martha Anderson laid in her king size bed, wearing only a smile as she reached for the phone on the nightstand.<br />
She was already proudly displaying her werecat features, something her OB/GYN said wouldn&#39;t be a concern until the last week before her due date, when Martha should conserve her strength for the impending birth of her forthcoming daughter.<br />
When the person on the other end of the line answered the call, Martha happily said, &quot;Kat? We&#39;re on for Friday night for you to meet my sons. Hope you like spaghetti and meatballs. It&#39;s a house specialty.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love it, and you too,&quot; purred the weretigress on the other end.<br />
