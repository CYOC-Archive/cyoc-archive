<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moment Willow had turned her attention from him, the moment she&#39;d gone after Tammy, Rob knew it was his only chance for freedom. He&#39;d pulled himself up from the table as quietly as he could (which given he had a the body of a knockout supermodel with tits the size watermelons and hips to match was no easy feat), pulled off the pair of heels he was wearing, and he&#39;d made a barefoot beeline for the only other exit from the kitchen: The basement.<br />
<br />
Rob opened the basement door as quietly as he could and bit his plump lower lip in pain as he squeezed his giant new assets through the aperture, wincing at the sensitivity of his nipples as they pressed against the fabric of the low cut green dress and the hard door. But then he was through, and he slid the door closed behind him, the light from the kitchen fading away to a faint darkness as LED lights lit up each step of a staircase leading down into the NEW Strasserman basement.<br />
<br />
The irony wasn&#39;t lost on the bully turned bombshell. His morning had started in the basement of the OLD Strasserman house, there on orders from Jonathan Ingerman to wait until Bill&#39;s family was out of the house and then burn the entire place down as &#39;revenge&#39;, but Rob knew it was just a trap to get Big Jon&#39;s only competition out of the way permanently. And Rob had complied, as Big Jon expected of his &#39;loyal&#39; lackey, the cowed, tamed beast of Shermer. But Rob was smarter than most people gave him credit for; The big man hadn&#39;t just kept control over a gang of bullies simply out of brute force, or had gotten away with the no small amount of petty thievery over the years. Rob was smarter than most people gave him credit for, and he wasn&#39;t going to waltz right into the trap.<br />
<br />
So Rob had waited until Shitterman&#39;s parents had left, creeping upstairs to get Bill alone and propose some kind of alliance to take Big Jon down for good...Only to see the little nerd and that failure Tom Ackteron arguing with the hot but bitchy Gloria Vanapolous across the street! Gloria had been holding some kind of rock and the three of them were fighting over it...<br />
<br />
And then there was that flash of light and suddenly he was a woman! A incredibly hot woman! Sitting in a car that looked like it was out of some sci fi flick! He&#39;d had just enough time to look himself over and mutter a obscenity before the girl, Willow, round the corner. Then it was like he&#39;d been thrown in some kind of twisted prison, nothing more than a passenger in his own mind as this &#39;Bobbi&#39; acted like a little demure doe in the headlights, allowing the shorter girl to pull her up the stairs and submit her to a humiliating meet and greet with her &#39;parents&#39;.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh, you&#39;ve got to be fucking kidding me with this bullshit!&#39; Rob had groaned to no one but himself when he&#39;d seen just who those parents were. The old man was clearly Bill Strasserman and the Meryl Streep knockoff in the business suit was Gloria Vanapolous (given she looked almost identical to her mother). The little blonde he had trouble placing until he realized it was Tom Ackerton, the sports star acting like some perfect little housewife. And he was getting engaged to their crotch goblin!<br />
<br />
And what was with that sob story at the table?<br />
<br />
&#39;Fucking embarassing&#39; Rob muttered in his new breathy voice as he descended the stairs, praying to whatever deity that was clearly messing with him to not let the wood structure squeak. But the bully turned bombshell reached the concrete floor of the basement without incident and blinked into the darkness with eyelashes that were so long they were slowly driving him crazy. Unlike the original Strasserman basement, this one was fairly generic. Before Bill&#39;s new house has a full carpet floor, a bathroom plus the whole area that Bill had claimed as his own, filled with Marvel and Star Wars and other geek shit. This basement just had a handful of shelves filled with what looked like junk and some old furniture...<br />
<br />
&#39;Bingo!&#39; Rob thought as he spied another door. Faint light spilled in from a gap in the heavy curtains, obviously leading outside. Above him he heard the sounds of whatever was happening to Willow begin to subside and just to be on the safe side of...whatever, he cupped two tiny hands over his earring bejeweled ears and made his way as fast as he could through the dark confines of the basement, stubbing a painted toe once on some un-seen object and fighting back the instinctive urge to swear at the top of his lungs. But then he was at the door, quickly flipping the two locks open and turning the knob, the door swinging wide to reveal the Strasserman&#39;s backyard.<br />
<br />
Above him he could hear Willow&#39;s voice calling out to him. Or rather, to Bobbi and he quickly covered his ears once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shitshitshit!&quot; He whispered, his green eyes wide, afraid that this new body he was in would come like a dog and he&#39;d be trapped as Bobbi for who knew how long again. But as he heard the muffled sound of Willow and then Tammy calling out to him...nothing happened. Or well, nothing save for a nagging feeling, more of an itch, for him to march back up those stairs and into the arms of her Willow. Maybe it was visual contact? Willow WAS pretty easy on the eyes...<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck that!&quot; Rob snarled, giving his pretty new head a hard smack, turning his attention back to escaping. The backyard of Bill and Tammy&#39;s new house was wide and long, typical of the more wealthy area of Shermer and definitely larger than Bill&#39;s old backyard had been. And instead of a fence there was a row of hedges that were as tall as Rob used to be. Now they simply towered over his much smaller, prettier frame. Rob poked his long-haired head out of the doorway and angrily held the waterfall of red locks off to the side as he looked side to side, finally spying a path that led back up to the ground level of the large house, possibly to the front yard or a garage or something. He chanced a glance upwards, noting the that there were more than a few windows. And if Shitterman and Titsapolous were still on the front porch...All in all, there was a high chance that he could be seen.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t ideal, but if worse came to worse Rob could just go through the bushes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Bolstrum, here you go...&quot; Rob said as he readied himself for the escape of his lifetime.<br />
<br />
&#39;Then what are you gonna do Robbie? You&#39;ll still be a chick! And still stuck...Wherever the hell you are!&#39; A condescending voice in his head said. And it was right. Everything had come from Vanapolous and that weird rock she was holding! Maybe she was still on the front porch...If he could surprise her, maybe grab the gemstone and make a wish to be back to normal...<br />
<br />
Rob glanced at his hairless arms.<br />
<br />
...But overpowering Gloria, and definitely Bill was out of the question. The girl he&#39;d been transformed into clearly only had enough muscle tone to help with her looks, she was no fighter.<br />
<br />
And if Rob got caught, he&#39;d end up trapped in his own body again. And who knew if him getting away was just a fluke of whatever had changed everything or not! Or maybe if he played the part...Maybe he&#39;d have a better opportunity to get away? One with less risk?<br />
<br />
Regardless, the sound of the basement door opening forced him to take action.</p>
