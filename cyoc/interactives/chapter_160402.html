<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Melanie and James got dressed and started walking together hand in hand, a thought came across his mind. “Mel, we have got a couple hours before we need to be at Elspeth’s for dinner. If you don’t mind, I would like to ask a favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Sure, what is it?”<br />
<br />
“Let me give you a little context before I ask.” James then recounted the whole episode with Meghan. Melanie listened intently and was fascinated with the whole tale.<br />
<br />
“Wow that was quite the ordeal.”<br />
<br />
“Yes it was. But I learned some things about myself and it also gave me a unique insight. I was wondering. Could you age us both to 80 years old? I would like us to spend the next couple of hours as an old couple to see how we might feel about each other is we are still together after all those years.”<br />
Melanie was taken aback by his request as she stood silently contemplating his request. James took her silence as apprehension at his request.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, it was a silly notion, forget I said anything.”<br />
<br />
“No, James, I was actually just thinking it might be interesting to experience that, it could be kind of sweet too. Ok, I’m in.”<br />
<br />
Melanie then stripped off her sarong, thing bikini bottoms and her top, releasing her incredibly large and firm breasts. James shinnied out of his shorts. Melanie then concentrated and with a wave of her hands the incantation was complete.<br />
<br />
Both of them shot up in height almost immediately as they left their teen years. Melanie went from 17 to 30 almost instantly as did James.<br />
James was dumb struck at her beauty as a full grown mature adult. Her breasts had gotten larger to full D Cups and they still defied gravity as her hips expanded and long legs lengthened, her backside was ow a breath-taking “bubble butt” that would make any woman jealous.<br />
<br />
James also regained is mature manhood as his penis grew and his features sharpened as his muscles bulged and his square jaw bristled with his light beard.<br />
<br />
“What do you think lover? Purred Melanie in a low sultry adult voice as she put her hands on her womanly hips and struck a pose.<br />
<br />
“I think you’re incredible, so beautiful!”<br />
<br />
Melanie smiled as she then glanced down at Jame’s throbbing member.<br />
“I must say that I whole heatedly approve of your changes as well. Glad to see how you’re going to turn out one day. Uh, oh, here comes part two.”<br />
The aging spell started up again as they quickly aged into their 40. Melanie’s large breasts began their slow descent down her chest as James could see lines appearing on her smooth face as grey hair began to weave its way through her hair.<br />
<br />
The couple quickly and rapidly aged through their 50s, when they should have been parents of grown children sat this age. Then into their 60s and 70s, when they should have grown grandchildren, finally stopping at 80 years of age.<br />
<br />
James had already experienced this and knew what to expect. What he was not expecting was just how well Melanie had aged into a senior citizen. Her hair was now a stylish steel grey color and while she had wrinkles on her face, it was a kind face that was lovely to look at like a kindly grandmother. Her body was certainly more frail and had lost muscle mass and her skin was translucent and thinning, but her weathered legs still held some shape to them.<br />
<br />
She had certainly aged better than Meghan had. Melanie did not try to hide her large breasts which while sagging, still retained some shape to them as she put her weathered hands on her womanly hips once again and struck a similar pose.<br />
<br />
“So Grandpa, what do you think?” she said is a raspy, low voice that still sounded sexy.<br />
<br />
“I think you’re the sexiest great-Grandmother I have ever seen!”<br />
<br />
“I guess I would be a great-grandmother at this point, wouldn’t I”?” she cackled.<br />
<br />
Then with a wave of her bony hand the two of them were now dressed in age-appropriate clothing. Both also now had canes as James walked over to the old woman and offered his arm.<br />
<br />
“Care for a stroll Grandma?”<br />
<br />
“I sure would.” She smiled as she took his arm ad they began to shuffle down the path. At one point the came to a clearing where they saw a number of the girls playing volleyball, including a still nude Alexandra. <br />
“They all look so young” mumbled James.<br />
<br />
“Yep, they are just wisps of girls at that age. A bunch of young whippersnappers who don’t realize how much life means.”<br />
<br />
“I believe you’re right.”<br />
<br />
“Come on dear, it is not good to ponder such things at our age.”<br />
<br />
As the old couple came to a small clump of tree’s that was obscured from view, James looked over at the now 80 year old Melanie and he felt something inside of him stir. He then dropped his cane and grabbed Melanie and kissed her shriveled lips long and hard.<br />
<br />
“Well!” said an out of breath Melanie. “I never would have expected that after all these years.”<br />
<br />
“Well hang on to your bonnet old woman, cause it has been too long.” And with that he slowly and carefully let Melanie down to the ground. As he laid down beside her he began to kiss her once again and this time he let his right hand caress his way to her sagging breasts as she began to knead them like dough in his hands. This produced a loud moan from Melanie. He then made his way down her dress until he pulled it up and began to caress her leg as the support hose she was wearing slowly collapsed down to her ankles. They broke their kiss as James then frantically began to undress the old woman, while she began doing to same to him as well. Soon her dress was off as James expertly unclasped her support underwire bra and removed it, letting the sagging yet shapely orbs fall free as he smothered his face in her breasts and began to suckle on them, making the old woman moan even louder. He then looked down to see her old vagina with white hair as he then started kissing her soft abdomen and then he finally reached her pussy and began to lick and probe its interior with his tongue. Melanie groaned in ecstasy as she grabbed James white hair as she bit her lower lip and then exclaimed “Oh James! Yes! Please don’t stop!”<br />
James expertly found her clit and began to use his tongue to dance around it driving Melanie wild with desire. “I need you inside me James NOW!”<br />
That was all he need to hear as he moved and hovered on top of Melanie, his dick surprisingly hard for a man of his age as he entered her with one thrust, which made Melanie squeal in pleasure. They soon found themselves moving in rhythmic motion together, but in a slow methodical way and not like two teens, as Melanie moaned with each thrust.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes James darling, yes!”<br />
<br />
Soon Melanie felt an old familiar feeling as she felt herself beginning to climax. “I’m almost there James, almost….there! YES! OH DEAR GOD YES!” she screamed as she was hit with multiple orgasms. James unloaded with little load he has at his age, but it was more than enough to give him a feeling of bliss and satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Both of them were completely out of breath as James pulled out and collapsed next Melanie.. Melanie then rolled on her side and put her grey covered head on James chest. <br />
<br />
“That was so wonderful my love. So wonderful. You are such a dear for giving this old woman the time of her life.”<br />
<br />
“I was afraid I might hurt you.” Said an out of breath James.<br />
<br />
“Nonsense and fiddle sticks. I may be old but I am spry. I was more worried that you might through your back out.”<br />
<br />
“It was touch and go for a while, but I still got it in me!”<br />
<br />
After lying there basking in the afterglow for a while they slowly got up and got dressed, though it took them a while. Melanie then picked up her cane and then winced as a slight pain his her lower back. “Owww! I think I might have exacerbated by sciatica. I keep forgetting I am not as young as I used ta be.” She said as she bent over slightly and out her hand on her back for support. Hey two shuffled their way to a waiting park bench where they sat down hand-in-hand as they watched the sunset together as Melanie put her head on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Well old woman of mine, it is about that time.”<br />
<br />
“Time for what? She rattled as she looked at James.<br />
<br />
“Time to make us young again.”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about?” said Mel with a look of confusion on her face.<br />
<br />
“Are you having a senior moment, dear? What’s this nonsense about turning us young?”<br />
<br />
James got nervous. “Mel honey, how are you, really, I mean how old are you?”<br />
<br />
“Why I’m 80 years young you old fool and this is our 6oth wedding anniversary.”<br />
<br />
“Oh God, no. Melanie, you need to wait here til I can get some help.”<br />
<br />
“What was that you said dearie? I’m hard of hearing ya know, so stop mumbling!”<br />
<br />
James was about to run off when suddenly he heard Melanie laugh, or rather cackle like the old witch she now was.<br />
<br />
“I had ya going there for as moment, didn’t I?”<br />
<br />
“Jesus Christ woman! You nearly gave me a heart attack!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, but it was too good to pass up. I may be an old woman but I still got a wicked sense of humor. So, did ya learn anything>” she said as she stood up and leaned on her cane for support.<br />
<br />
James relaxed the stern look on his face and then looked at her with affection.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I did. I discovered that I love you Mel and will no matter how old we both might get.”<br />
<br />
Melanie was expecting some witty come back, but not that expression of love. It moved her deeply as she started to tear up. “Now look at what you made me do. It isn’t dignified for a witch to cry.”<br />
<br />
James handed her a handkerchief and then hesitantly spoke up.  “Did you learn anything?”<br />
<br />
Melanie stopped and sniffled a couple times and then put her bony hand up to Jame’s wrinkled face.<br />
<br />
“I did, and it took me off guard to be honest. I love you too James.”<br />
James leaned in and gently kissed the old woman.<br />
<br />
“I guess we should transform back now, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Not unless you want to show up at Elspeth’s house looking like this.”<br />
<br />
“No, I think that would be a bad idea.”<br />
<br />
And with that Melanie waved her hands and instantly they were both teenagers again and both wearing the clothes they had started with. As they started walking towards Elspeth’s house hand in hand Melanie spoke up.<br />
<br />
“You know, I thought the first time we had sex it would be as teenagers, I never expected that our first time would be as an elderly couple. I have to say it was very satisfying too. We might have to try that again sometime.” She smiled as she squeezed his hand.<br />
<br />
“Deal, but only after we explore each other’s bodies as they are now first.”<br />
“I can live with that.” She giggled.<br />
<br />
As they both arrive at Elspeth’s house, James knocked on the foor.</p>
