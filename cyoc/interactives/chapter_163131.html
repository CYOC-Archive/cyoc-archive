<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up dazed and confused.<br />
<br />
You rub your eyes and sit up in the bed you’re lying on. Bright fluorescent lights blind you and reflect off the white walls of the room, which is about the size of an average bedroom. There is a table across from you with various tools and equipment. A stethoscope and a white coat hang from the door. A monitor next to you makes continuous beeping sounds.<br />
<br />
Then you realize: you’re in a hospital.<br />
<br />
You lift the white blankets that cover you. You’re wearing a one-piece hospital gown and there is a white wristband on your right arm. Many tubes and wires are connected to your body.<br />
<br />
You try to remember what happened last night. You can picture yourself and a friend sitting in a car. Then screaming. Maybe a flash of light and noise. Lots of noise. And then silence.<br />
<br />
“I must have been in a car accident,” you conclude.<br />
<br />
You hear voices outside and strain your ears to listen.<br />
<br />
“No, he won’t be awake yet,” says a deep, gravelly voice.<br />
<br />
“What are we going to tell him?” a second voice asks, this one a woman’s. <br />
<br />
“I have no idea.”<br />
<br />
“How could you be so stupid!?”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry! The opioids and the mutated steroids look so similar.”<br />
<br />
“Hopefully they don’t cause him any damage.”<br />
<br />
“I think he’ll be fine.” The man sounds uncertain though. You are beginning to get worried.<br />
<br />
You watch as the doorknob turns. You close your eyes and pretend to still be asleep.<br />
<br />
You hear a doctor walk into the room and shut the door behind him. He or she types something on a keyboard. <br />
<br />
“I know you’re awake Connor,” the doctor says. It’s the man, his low voice unmistakable. He has an average build with a thick, nicely trimmed beard.<br />
<br />
You sit up in bed. “How?”<br />
<br />
“This computer here tells me a lot of information,” the doctor said. You suddenly remember the tubes and wires connected to your body.<br />
<br />
“That’s what all this is doing?” you ask.<br />
<br />
“Yes, and much more.” He must see the worried look on your face because he gives you a sympathetic smile. “My name is Doctor Adams. I think you deserve to know the truth. There’s a new drug in the world now. It’s called X5-H27-B. Most people just call it mutated steroids.”<br />
<br />
“Well, what does it do?”<br />
<br />
“It acts like steroids, which as you probably now are used to build muscle mass and strength. Their mutated counterparts are dangerous though. They work extremely fast once they kick in and could have major side effects.”<br />
<br />
“So that’s what you gave me?”<br />
<br />
Dr. Adams looks confused but then realizes you heard him speaking outside the room. “Yes, Connor. You have been injected with mutated steroids. I can not apologize enough for my mistake, but I am certain that you will be just fine.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t seem so sure.”<br />
<br />
“Trust me. You’ll be out of this hospital soon enough, maybe with a new body.”<br />
<br />
Doctor Adams leaves the room. You are terrified. A new body? The doubt from Doctor Adams only adds to the fear. <br />
<br />
Your head swimming with thoughts, you lay your head back down on the pillow and fall asleep.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
You wake up the next morning and panic. “Where am I?” Then relief floods your body as you remember where you are. But the panic quickly reruns when you think about the mutated steroids.<br />
<br />
You flip the sheets off your body and look under the hospital gown. You still look the same. No changes yet.<br />
<br />
Thankful, you rest your head back down. Just then, a female doctor walks into the room.<br />
<br />
“Where’s Doctor Adams?” you ask.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry Connor. Doctor Adams was let go last night. He was one of my best friends.”<br />
<br />
This doctor was probably the one Doctor Adams had been talking to outside the door yesterday.<br />
<br />
“I’m Doctor Jones,” she says. “I just need to check your vitals and I’ll be on my way.”<br />
<br />
She ran a series of tests that seemed to take forever - especially in the anticipation of what I knew what was going to happen to me. <br />
<br />
She was almost finished when it happened. It came without warning.<br />
<br />
She removed a needle from my arm and I let out a moan. Wait, what? That doesn’t seem right. But I was filled with immense pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” Doctor Jones asked.<br />
<br />
“I feel amazing.”<br />
<br />
Your hospital gown starts to feel tight. You lift off the covers and your jaw drops. You are growing.<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones let out a shriek. “No, no, no this wasn’t supposed to happen yet.” She shoots out the door and leaves you alone. <br />
<br />
Your biceps were expanding and stretching. They were huge. The hospital gown was as so tight you could see every curve of your growing body. <br />
<br />
All of a sudden the gown couldn’t take any more. It ripped and fell to either side of you. Your entire naked body was exposed.<br />
<br />
You were ripped.<br />
<br />
Your pecs were expanded outward and your abs are perfectly shaped. You rub them, having always wanted to know what they would feel like. More moaning escapes your mouth.<br />
<br />
Your hands are huge and your feet stretch upwards. Your legs and calves grew before your eyes, stretching and expanding. <br />
<br />
Everything felt so amazing you don’t want it to ever stop. You groan with rapture. It felt like you were having a continuous orgasm.<br />
<br />
Hair started to sprout all over your arms and legs. There was a lot on your chest and some of it trailed down your abs and into a huge bush of pubes. You feel hair growing on your face and you reach up to feel your new beard.<br />
<br />
You continue to grow, the hospital bed creaking under your weight. The monitor had started beeping much faster. <br />
<br />
Your biceps are enormous. You flex them and rub them. You also rub your hands over your abs and pecs again. They feel so good.<br />
<br />
You basically scream with pleasure when your dick starts to move. It reaches the size of your normal erections but then it keeps going, reaching for the white ceiling.<br />
<br />
You grab it with your huge hands and began jerking off. You rub it up and down while it is still growing, thicker and taller. Your balls explode with size and grow hair all over them. <br />
<br />
Pre-cum leaks out of your shaft as you jerk off harder than you ever had before. Your body is still growing. You can’t believe how big you are.<br />
<br />
Just then you hear a creak, and then the hospital bed collapses under your weight. The monitor is beeping extremely fast now. But none of that stops you.<br />
<br />
You continue to jerk off. Your cock is easily two feet long and your balls are the size of softballs. <br />
<br />
Your moans get louder as you rub your enormous shaft. You are in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Your entire body almost fills the room. Your feet touch the opposite wall. “Will I ever stop growing?” you think suddenly getting worried.<br />
<br />
Just then Doctor Adams runs into the room and the injects you with a syringe.<br />
<br />
The antidote stops the growing but you can’t hold back your orgasm. You groan with pleasure as tons of warm cum erupts out of your three foot long monster cock. Your basketball sized balls shoot out everything that had they had built up.<br />
<br />
You collapse onto the ruined hospital bed and breathe heavily. You huge hairy pecs rising and falling with every breath.<br />
<br />
You look over at Doctor Adams who was covered in your sperm and looking as shocked and terrified as ever. <br />
<br />
“I feel amazing,” you say in a much deeper voice than you were exiting. “My body is huge!”<br />
<br />
Doctor Adams was at a loss for words. “I - uh...”<br />
 <br />
You wrap your arms around your enormous dick and pull it close to you, still rubbing it. Your cock is still leaking cum. <br />
<br />
“Doctor Jones came to get me when I you started changing. I wish I could have been here to see it.” The after a few seconds he said, “Can I touch it?”<br />
<br />
“You can do more than that,” you reply. “Get out of here and fuck me in my giant hairy ass.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to tell me twice,” he says, a very noticeable erection peaking through his lab coat.<br />
“Can I tell you a secret?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” you say.<br />
<br />
“I gave you those mutated steroids on purpose.” Then he kisses you on the mouth and pounds you in the ass, the monitor still beeping loudly.</p>
