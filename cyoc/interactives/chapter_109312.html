<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Austin rolled the dice. A two. He moved his token and picked up the card. He read it out loud in his squeaky voice. &quot;Pick a sport. Say it aloud&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Umm, football I guess?&quot; Austin said. All of a sudden he felt a terrible cramping all over his body and cried out. The other three boys were scared. Austin started growing taller and muscles were getting larger and developing all over his body. Within seconds he was a few inches taller and he had thicker arms and legs. His chest started barreling out forward and his shoulders cracked as they broadened significantly. He moaned again in his high pitched voice, only to have it break and drop considerably half way through. It settled in a rumbling masculine baritone. It felt like something was caught in his throat so Austin felt it. He felt a thick Adams apple push out.<br />
<br />
Austin felt his clothes rip all around him, leaving him just in his white briefs. Apparently his manhood had also grown considerably and was creating an obscene bulge in them. Veins raced up and down his legs and arms, and his biceps grew huge. Lastly his briefs finally gave and his cock flopped out. It had to be at least 8 inches long, but it was totally soft!<br />
<br />
Austin felt an incredible itching start at his feet and move up. Thick brown body hair was pushing out of his skin and racing up. It exploded into a very thick bush around his cock. His stomach likewise was absolutely dusted in hair. His chest became a thick rug of hair. He felt itching under his arms as thick put hair grew in. Lastly Austins face was dusted with some brown sandpapery stubble.<br />
<br />
Austin sat there, naked and panting. He was about 6 and a half feet tall and 260 pounds. He was incredibly musclebound and hairy. He looked like the perfect football linebacker!<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!&quot;, Cody yelled, &quot;is this game for real?! This is awesome. Look at how big you are!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Reese piped in; &quot;look at how hairy your are! That&#39;s crazy! And look at how big your penis is now!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa&quot;, Austin grunted in his incredibly deep and booming voice.<br />
<br />
Jack picked up the box; &quot;it says in the instructions that when we finish, all the transformations revert back to normal. Guess we need to keep playing! Reese do you want to go next?&quot;<br />
<br />
Reese shrugged and rolled the die. 3. He moved his piece and picked up the card.<br />
<br />
&quot;All it says is &#39;mega foreskin&#39;, what does that me-&quot;, but Reese couldn&#39;t finish. It felt like he had been kicked in the crotch. He quickly opened the waist band of his pants and peeked. &quot;AHH!&quot; he yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?!&quot;, Austin boomed. Reese took off his pants and boxers and let them see. The boys had all known Reese had a pretty big package from changing before gym class and they knew he was circumsized. Except now he had a foreskin over his cock. A large one! And it was still growing. The loose skin kept growing and growing until there was about 7-8 inches of loose foreskin dangling over the tip of his penis. It hung there like a wet flesh noodle. The foreskin was longer than Reese&#39;s penis! How would he go to the bathroom with this. How would he clean it!?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Reese yelled. &quot;Gross!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Cody and Jack start laughing while Austin scruntches up his face in disgust. &quot;Its like a dangling flesh straw! Gross! How can you even use that now!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Reese sat down in shame, pissed with his changes. Austin got to be a big strong football player and he got this! Sitting on the ground, his foreskin lay on the cold ground coiled beneath him.<br />
<br />
Your turn Cody! He picked up the dice and hoped for a good change. He rolled a 1. He picked up the card. &quot;Slob&quot;, said Cody. The changes were instantaneous.<br />
<br />
Cody grew like long greasy hair, his clothes became filled with holed and disheveled. Nasty yellow spots stained the armpits of his tank top, while the small blonde wisps of armpit hair he had grew in bushes! Likewise his whole white tank top took on a faintish yellow color. He became covered  in dirt and sweat. His pants became stiff from sweat and piss. His toenails and fingernails grew long yellow and cracked. His teeth became bright yellow and some of them fell out of his mouth. The stink around Cody was almost visible. He raised his arm to check his changes and Reese was assaulted by the odor wafting out of Cody newly hairy pits. His body odor was fierce.<br />
<br />
Cody looked in his pants. He saw his cock wasn&#39;t any bigger but it was surrounded by a huge bush of matted twisted blonde hair. It itched really bad and upon closer inspection he saw little bugs crawling all in his pubes. His crotch stunk so bad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god! You stink dude! That&#39;s nasty!&quot; Jack yelled. Cody burned bright red in embarrassment. To make matters worse, Cody let out an uncontrollable fart, and a little bit came out in his pants. He was ashamed. &quot;It&#39;s not his fault&quot; boomed Austin; &quot;its this game! We have to finish now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Last, it was Jacks turn. He rolls 5. &quot;Pick one player to perform oral sex on, with a surprise at the end&quot;. He was disgusted! &quot;Gross, im not doing that!&quot;, Jack yelled. &quot;You have to!&quot;, Reese pleaded, &quot;or well be stuck like this!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jack was mortified. He was 100% straight. The last thing he wanted to do was have a dick in his mouth. But there appeared to be no choice. &quot;Who will it be?&quot; Cody asked.<br />
<br />
Jack looked at Cody&#39;s stinky cheesy slob cock and instantly crossed him out. Austins cock looked to be way to big, but he didn&#39;t think Reese could even cum with that huge foreskin in the way. He knelt down in from of Austin. &quot;Make it quick&quot;, Jack pleaded.<br />
<br />
Austin was ashamed to feel excited, but he was. He had never had a blowjob before. Plus, this new body of his was full of testosterone and he was very horny. Austin was hard in seconds and Jack gasped at the length. It had to be 11 inches long and so thick!<br />
<br />
Jack stated at the cock and said &quot;Austin I think your too bi-&quot;, but Austin shoved his cock in before he could finish; Austin was too horny. As the huge member pumped into him, he felt like he was choking. Jack could taste the sweaty cock and it was nasty! He also felt his nose being buried in Austin&#39;s thick pubes. Austins bloated hairy sac kept slapping him in his chin. It was humiliating!<br />
<br />
Jack was disgusted, he tried to pull away but before he could, Austin took a powerful hand and held him down in place. It only took a few minutes for Austin to cum, but it felt like an eternity to Jack. Jack felt the hot salty load rocket into his throat. He spit it up and got it all over his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;THERE&quot;, he said sputtering, &quot;I did it. Uggh that was so gross&quot;.<br />
<br />
Austin chuckled in a deep voice and patted him on the back. &quot;Thanks. I needed that Jack&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just then Jack remembered the &quot;surprise&quot;. What was it? Just then there was a flash of smoke around Jack and Austins groin. When the smoke cleared, Jack could see that he now possessed Austin&#39;s huge hairy linebacker member. It looked out of place on his small frail body. It was soft and hung nearly to his knees. Everytime he walked it turned into a weighty pendulum.<br />
<br />
Austin looked down and saw that he had Jacks cock now. Hairless and very tiny. It looked ridiculous on his huge linebacker&#39;s body!<br />
<br />
The boys started laughing at Austin. Red faced, Austin said &quot;whatever. Its my turn. Round 2!&quot;<br />
<br />
Austin rolled the dice...</p>
