<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your head was swimming. Your sister had accidentally retconned reality, and turned herself into a minotaur bull and never realizing it. And had implied to be in a physical relationship with at least one of the cows. <br />
<br />
Had your sister just wiped herself from existence completely? Or did traits of her remain in this new bull man? <br />
<br />
You were able to pass it by since you DIDN&#39;T know the people you&#39;d changed in the parking lot, and that had been a panicked decision. The disclaimer said all choices couldn&#39;t be reversed and all of them were on his head. And at the same time said to do whatever he WANTED with it the thing. Maybe this was what the disclaimer meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Master, ugh, sorry, I mean, little brother, let&#39;s get the groceries in and then we can check up on Billie and Jacklyn.&quot; <br />
<br />
You startled. You felt surprise, relief, and confusion all at once, and left you dizzy. He was still your sibling. Though you doubted they responded to Sera anymore. At least you were still family... It did make you feel a bit better about what you&#39;d done. Though you were as confused as ever at how that was even possible. <br />
<br />
You thought of what the instructions on the binoculars had said, <br />
<br />
&#39;Should you need any additional assistance in reaching the very best version of you possible, be sure to observe yourself using the Moo&#39;NOCULARS through the mirror! It&#39;s guaranteed to give you a leg-up on the competition!&#39;<br />
<br />
Was... was this transformation meant for you?! For you to become the bull with a harem of loyal and obedient cows? <br />
<br />
If anything, at least it explained your new brother&#39;s oversized pouch. <br />
<br />
So in other words... had your sister become a bull purely because she&#39;d looked at HERSELF through the binoculars? Had you being the owner &#39;set&#39; the transformation of anyone who looked at themselves with the sighters to always be male?<br />
<br />
If this was really changing reality, what would happen if you used this on a mother? Or a father? Would their mate flip automatically? Or would it just not work? Would their children be cow-people as well then? Way too many questions... <br />
<br />
You could just melt the binoculars and be done with them... Except you&#39;d bought them. You weren&#39;t given them. You didn&#39;t stumble upon them. You checked them out. You read the instructions. You didn&#39;t think they were just an obstacle illusion. You&#39;d known what they did, and you bought them with your own money. You could have even bought a pair that turned people into some other creature. But you&#39;d chosen the cattle. <br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t deny it, part of you WANTED to have these, wanted to use them, wanted to rewrite people&#39;s self and existence. Your sister had gotten caught in the crossfire. And you were in for a penny, in for a pound. Maybe a decent people would bury them, or take them back to the store... Were you a decent people? You thought so. <br />
<br />
The instructions all but gave you a license to rewrite reality. <br />
<br />
The instructions, <br />
<br />
&#39;3. Observe their growth into a more natural being, naturally inclined to help you further your goals!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;More natural being&#39;, you now wondered what they meant. Natural as in nudist? More natural as in &#39;animal people&#39;?  Or &#39;natural&#39; as in removal of some of society&#39;s norms? Or were the people who made these things and sold them through &#39;Spells R Us&#39; at the strip mall just big fat perverts? <br />
<br />
Unless they were spawned by some cosmic being as a prank, but it had come in a box with a bunch of disclaimers to boot, so there had to be a manufacturer. Was there a cosmic enterprise selling reality-altering items across time and space? <br />
<br />
You wonder if you go back to the store if it&#39;ll even still be there, that&#39;s how these things normally went. <br />
<br />
&#39;naturally inclined to help you further your goals!&#39;<br />
<br />
What goals did you even have? You weren&#39;t interested in being king of the world or anything. But it seemed you had a responsibility now to the herd you&#39;d created. And it seemed it was your responsibility to round out and expand their community. Or at least that let you put things into focus.<br />
<br />
You wondered if anyone bought any of the other binoculars, or if the magic ship moved between universes only selling one to one person per reality or something. Were there people out there creating harems of animal people of their own? <br />
<br />
Well, you were given other options, and you picked cows. This was the path of your choosing. <br />
<br />
And you thought of Billie and Jacklyn... You did promise to milk both of them, best not keep them waiting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bro&#39;, can you drive? I&#39;m feeling kinda distracted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, but if we crash, you&#39;re legally responsibility for me,&quot; he &#39;reminded you.&#39; Well. He was part of your herd, your cattle, made sense. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t believe this. This is impossible! This doesn&#39;t make any sense at all! It&#39;s insane!&quot; Jacklyn declared, her eyes widened and then darkly narrowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;They took the fairy sidekick and turned her into a hacker using a fairy screen name. They turned the ancient demon lord and made him a corrupt CEO. And they had the hero be dead and out of the picture for three-fifths of the story, then had him DIE AGAIN on the cliffhanger!&quot; She slapped the book she was reading indignantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot; Billie asked as she worked on the milking machine, Jacklyn helping her when asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;And they took a high fantasy adventure and turned it all completely mundane. If I go to visit a lake, I don&#39;t wanna arrive to find someone drained the water and called it an improvement just before asking me to go for a swim!&quot;  <br />
<br />
If there was one thing you didn&#39;t argue with Jacklyn about, it was reboots. Didn&#39;t help they ended the original books with a universe eating demon devouring everything. Billie was pretty sure the original author was sick of writing the book series by that point. <br />
<br />
As Billie slide a long hard thick pipe into its waiting hole, she stopped working for a moment and turned towards her sister. <br />
<br />
&quot;You ever think it&#39;s weird Master has Sean as the bull of the herd and not himself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re asking that NOW?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The accident just reminded me how much he cares about us.&quot; She said of the human who had accidentally bumped his car into her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we are a herd of just two. Three counting his brother. It&#39;s not like he can just disown us and carry on with the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not the question: you think he&#39;d want to express it in the biggest way possible instead of having Sean do it for him... Not that I mind,&quot; Billie blushed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he just wants us to have a bull for company. Personally I never get cows who attach -emotions- to this kinda thing, sis. It&#39;s duty to continue the herd.&quot;<br />
<br />
Billie replied flatly, &quot;Gee, you&#39;re mother of the year material.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, if the herd needs calfs I&#39;ll &#39;lay back and think of England&#39;, but just because he&#39;s hot doesn&#39;t mean I HAVE the hots for him like you.&quot;</p>
