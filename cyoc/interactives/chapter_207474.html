<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sue was so entranced in her thoughts that she failed to notice just how close her brother was. While she believed that her brother was still far away, he was actually just a few steps away from her. She got up to her knees and wanted to dash for her room. But just as she took her first step, a mighty hand caught her shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sue? What are you doing here?&quot; Ben asked, wondering what was up with her sitting around the corner of the stairs.<br />
<br />
Sue, on the other hand, was taken aback by Ben&#39;s sudden appearence. She quickly turned around while holding the gun tight to her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-Nothing much. What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben was surprised by her question. He would&#39;ve bet that she would ask him about his more muscular body, but somehow she managed no to notice it. He had a feeling that Sue had to be involved with all this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting some baggier clothes for those beauties!&quot; Ben exclaimed as he flexed up a bicep. Sue couldn&#39;t believe just how stupid she was for accidentally choosing the wrong setting on the gun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Sue, you aren&#39;t possibly responsible for this, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
A shiver crawled down her spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-Me? Why should I be the cause?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a feeling of mine. What&#39;s behind your back then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing, huh? Let me see myself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben reached for the object behind Sue&#39;s back. She tried her best not to lose the gun, but it was to no avail. In mere seconds, her brother used his superior body to turn you around and to grab the gun out of your tight grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this then?&quot; Ben asked rhetorically.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s mine! Give it back to me, now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhh, it has many options. Were you trying to shrink me? Admit it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Why should I?&quot; Sue knew she was fucked, but still tried to safe herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? Because you wanted your revenge! But no more, now I&#39;m in control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, think about it. I helped you. I never wanted to hurt you.&quot; Sue tried to argue, but Ben was long gone as he looked at all the options of the gun and picking his favourite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess, you simply choose the mode and if you want to increase or decrease said aspect. I wonder what would happen if I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben held the gun&#39;s barrel towards his chest as he held down the trigger for a second. Almost instantly, his body reacted to the wanted changes and began to grow again.<br />
<br />
&quot;do this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everywhere on his body, his muscles grew bigger and denser. Ben&#39;s already big biceps further increased in size. It was now outgrowing even world record sizes as he flexed one intentionally. His mighty pecs stood out some more as his abs got more defined and harder. The strong pillars that were his legs gained many pounds of pure muscle mass. Ben could&#39;ve only dreamed of a body like this, and now, it was his!<br />
<br />
*Uh oh...&quot; Sue thought as she now knew it was too late. Her brother figured out how the gun worked and even grew himself already. No matter what happens now, she was sure she couldn&#39;t stop it even if she tried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I&#39;ve got to go now see y-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP!&quot; Ben ordered. &quot;Did you really think you could get away after what you tried to do? I was always such a good brother to you, but I&#39;m afraid I will have to punish you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben fiddled around with the settings of the gun, picking out one that he thought would make this situation a whole lot fairer... for him, at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
But it was too late, Ben aimed the gun towards Sue and held down the trigger. Instantly, Sue started to lose height. Inch after inch was taken from her average body. The longer he held down the trigger, the smaller she was. He didn&#39;t stop until she was significally smaller, ending at about 4 feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;That suits you a lot more!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t do this to me! Change me back, now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure I can&#39;t do this?&quot; He said as he flexed one arm again, showing off the biggest biceps the world has yet to have seen. &quot;What are you gonna do, fight me over it? Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make sure you won&#39;t even think about getting the gun back at all!&quot;<br />
<br />
For the third time now, he switched up the settings, now locking height and muscle. He again aimed at his own chest and fired, only this time, he held the trigger for a bit longer.<br />
<br />
In front of tiny Sue, Ben surged higher and higher as his muscles increased in size. As he reached six and a half feet in height, his muscles were already far bigger than any should be, but he didn&#39;t stop there. Just as he reached 7 feet flat, he stopped holding the trigger. Sue now gazed at an immensely huge person with muscles that would strike fear anywhere he went... and that person was her own little brother.<br />
<br />
He flexed his bicep, watching it rise up to the size of a pumpkin. His pecs have become literal chairs for people to sit on if they wanted. His now 10 pack was as defined as can be while being harder than steel. Many obliques surrounded them whereever Sue looked. His titanic thighs seemed strong enough to crush steel beams between them. Even his calves alone looked as big as his biceps were before his latest transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s more like it! Screw the hulk, I&#39;m so much better than him!&quot; After a few seconds of reveling his own musculature, Ben loocked down at the much smaller Sue and grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe it won&#39;t be a problem if I keep this gun for myself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sue simply shook her head, she was far too afraid of her colossal brother to argue against it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought so. Now go back to your room, before I shrink you down even further!&quot;<br />
<br />
With lightning speed, Sue dashed to her room, locking it from inside. She wouldn&#39;t have needed to do so since her brother was now far too strong for a locked door to block his path. But still, it gave Sue some sort of security against her huge brother.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ben smiled and headed back to his room to plan out what he wants to do next with his new device in hand.</p>
