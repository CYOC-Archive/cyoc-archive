<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr. Ngyung Noc stepped out of the portable lab that had been assigned to her. She had to respect the excellent training of the team Mr.<br />
  Dace had put together. There were over 25 men and women, militarily trained, and essentially all loyal to him and the higher ups.<br />
  The man in charge of this group that Mr. Dace had dispatched was a Sgt. Ronald West.<br />
  Sgt. West had, within an hour, cordoned off the entire town and locked it down very effectively. They had started by creating road<br />
  block on the road that led from the lab. Then using seldom traveled side road, with their ATVs, they had quickly covered ground to a<br />
  second road out of town. There again they created a road block, then moved on to the third road, the road that followed the rover up to<br />
  the city and where they would create a base of operations for controlling the viral spread. This was the road that was considered the<br />
  most important as it passed though most towns that would be in the way of infection.<br />
  After securing the outskirts of Otter Falls as such, only three roads led into the town or out of it, Sgt. West ordered the phone lines to be<br />
  cut. Power lines would remain uncut so as to avoid suspicion of sabotage as long as possible; the power would keep people form<br />
  panicking. Phone lines had to be removed because the virus’s effects took hold so quickly. There was a need to keep a cap of silence<br />
  on the mater. This problem with this method, in Dr. Noc’s opinion, was that it also caused a great deal of danger for the town and<br />
  endangered the lives of those who could possibly escape infection before it was too late. She had said nothing, at the time as she was<br />
  busy giving orders to the four scientists under her. All of them had been assigned by Mr. Dace to collect samples and the distribution of<br />
  masks. Another problem with the quarantine was that there were a number of forest trails that, if one knew well enough, could be used<br />
  to escape. Sgt. West had said that they were the preliminary beach head. People would attempt, at first, to leave through the roads and<br />
  only think of the trials later; after they found the roads impassible. By then though, back up from the company would arrive. <br />
  Apparently the company was calling in favors and drawing all its resources to bear on the situation; the company’s resources were<br />
  indeed considerable. In a day, perhaps two, many more soldiers would arrive on the road and help to cordon off the other towns as they<br />
  came under infection. More teams would be dispatched into the woods to guard the trials and capture any errant anthropomorphic<br />
  creatures.<br />
  “Is all well, Dr. Noc?” asked Sgt. West as she came up to him. He gave a form to one of his underlings.<br />
  “Yes, I’ve already started gathering data for Dr. Summers and I’ll make a report to him soon. The virus is moving at the projected<br />
  speeds which is a small blessing. I must say I am surprised Mr. Dace gave me aids for this project.” Ngyung said.<br />
  “He felt it was necessary.” Sgt. West said, simply.<br />
  “Still it was unexpected and very good of him. I hope to have a clinic set up, in another hour, for the injured and infected citizens.” Dr.<br />
  Noc said.<br />
  “Excuse me ma’m? I thought you were a scientist?” said Sgt. West “Why are you setting up a triage and hospital?”<br />
  “I am a scientist, but I am first and foremost a doctor” said Ngyung.<br />
  “I see” said Sgt. West.<br />
  “I do wish to bring up the fact that we have left no way for uninfected to leave the town. With the way these blockades are set up there<br />
  is no quick way to process people as they try to leave the town.” Dr. Noc said.<br />
  “Of course not, that’s because no one is leaving Otter Falls” said Sgt. West simply looking at Dr. Noc.<br />
  “Excuse me? What do you mean?” said Dr. Noc consternation on her face. “The policy as I understood it was to allow uninfected<br />
  humans out of quarantine zones so they would not be infected. We are supposed to be holding only the ones who knew about the<br />
  infections, of course, until later but…”<br />
  “We are under orders, Dr. Noc, from the higher ups. No one leaves under any circumstances” Said Sgt. West “The town of otter falls is<br />
  to remain under full quarantine.”<br />
  “What higher ups?” asked Dr. Noc, a bit angrily and with some suspicion.<br />
  “Mr. Hammersmith.” said Sgt. West.<br />
  “What? Hammersmith? But he was one of the major proponents of testing the virus on the general populace to see its effects as a<br />
  weapon and quick way to create bodies for the military breeding program. He was overruled by the rest of the board.” Dr. Noc said.<br />
  “The same board, as I understand it form Mr. Dace, feels that this situation can have some… dividends. They feel large scale testing,<br />
  now that it’s inevitable, is worth any potential cost.” said Sgt. West.<br />
  “But that unethical! Unfeeling! It’s plain monstrous!” said Dr. Noc angrily. “Innocent people could die!”<br />
  “No, once a human is infected, he isn’t human. Those things are monsters. They ain’t human anymore, Doc. Sorry no clinic, no one<br />
  leaves and that is final” said Sgt. West. “I’ve been given authority over you in these maters by Mr. Hammersmith. You retain command<br />
  over data collection, only.”<br />
  “But those people will need help!” said Dr. Noc angrily<br />
  “Stop being a bleeding heart Doc. In a few hours, the only ‘people’ in this town will be those of us who are keeping those ‘things’ here.<br />
  Now I suggest you get back to data collection; oh and a warning, Doc, don’t go reporting to Dr. Summers about this.” said Sgt. West.<br />
  “Hammersmith told me about that goody-two-shoes. He’s not willing to use an opportunity like this if it gets in the way of ethics. He<br />
  seems to lack a certain scientific conviction.”<br />
  “Fine,” said Dr. Noc with a hint of malice in her voice. The only thing holding Dr. Noc back form screaming at Sgt West and attacking<br />
  him was her long held, family taught, patience that had somehow, over time, subsumed her temper. She was angry but she knew she<br />
  would be of no help to Otter Falls or any other place if she got angry now. She’d be off the project in an instant if West reported that<br />
  she was ‘uncooperative’. She would comply, for now.</p>
