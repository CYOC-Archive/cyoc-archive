<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Minor violence and veiled threats</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Grandma!” Stacy shouted as she landed just outside of a small cabin in a forest. The forest located just outside of Heaven’s capital; Stacy was shocked that she was placed here. She was soon told by an angel that handles the arrival of souls entering heaven that this is where the old woman wished to be; near nature.<br />
However the woman that greeted Stacy looked nothing like her grandmother; she looked like a woman in her early thirties. While Stacy did see pictures of her grandmother when she was younger; those pictures were old black and white photos and where of poor quality. Yet the woman before her did have her grandmother’s raven black hair and steely stare. Both features Stacy had to observe leave her beloved relative as she got older and her health failed her.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry,” the young woman responding to the large angel with antler, translucent silver halo and wings blacker then the darkest night; “do I know you?”<br />
“Its me grandma,” Stacy bounding towards her; “your granddaughter. I’m now an angel!”<br />
“You don’t look like Stacy,” The woman looking confused; “she is still alive and on earth with her boyfriend.”<br />
“You mean me,” Charles landing and folding his wings back; “you saw through my disguise just as you died.”<br />
“Yes,” the woman looking stunned; “but what are you doing here? Why aren’t you with stacy?”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps this will help,” Stacy concentrating; “will her wings and antlers to retracted into her body; she rapidly loses height and then soon looks like the half Cherokee woman, she did before she came to heaven and walked into a magic pool. The only part that didn’t change was her hair; it’s was still raven black.<br />
“Stacy,” The woman looking stunned; “but how? Did you die?”<br />
“No I didn’t die,” Stacy hugging her grandmother; “but I am getting married. To Charles here,” Stacy grabbing her boyfriend; “I believe you two already know each other.”<br />
“Only briefly,” Charles offering a sheepish smile; “you notice my aura as you were passing. But a proper introduction is in order. My name is Charles Morningstar. Son of Michael and Parthenope; Parthenope is my mother’s angelic name,” Charles smiling; “but her human name was Joan of Arc.”<br />
<br />
****************************************************************<br />
<br />
Kushiel glared at Raphael. He wanted to interogate the demon Pava that Michael Morningstar brought to heaven the other day. Raphael stating that it wasn’t possible and that she was no longer her; Kushiel demanded to know where the vile creature was hiding.<br />
“I told you Kushiel,” Rahael’s patience wearing thin; “that the demon named Pava is no longer here.”<br />
“Then were,” Kushiel raising his voice; “I have questions to press upon her.”<br />
“Well you’re a day late and a dollar short,” Raphael snapping back; “plus didn’t god order you to protect her as if she were an honored guest? I was present when you dared to raise your blade to our holy king,” Raphael snapping back.<br />
“You still haven’t told me where she is,” Kushiel not backing down; “if she is dead then show me the ash pile; if she is still alive then why is she not placed under guard?”<br />
“Because she is no longer a demon,” Raphael tired of Kushiel’s bullying; “faith and prayer turned her to the light and she is now an angel. And don’t you dare accuse me of lying,” Raphael glaring; preparing to ready his sword if needed. “Jehovah was present when we both tended to her and he witness her reformation!”<br />
<br />
Kushiel was taken aback by what Raphael just told him; a demon becoming an angel.<br />
“I don’t believe you,” Kushiel said before Raphael levied a right cross to Kushiel’s jaw; causing the inquisitor to take a few steps back and spit out a bit of blood.<br />
“I warned you,” Raphael speaks as he unsheathes a large Scottish Claymore; “Accuse me of lying again and I’ll lop off one of your wings.”<br />
“If she is an angel as you so claim,” Kushiel seeing the resident healer; “then where is she?”<br />
“Not here,” Raphael snarling; “but if it will get you to leave, try the Papilio Estate. Jehovah reopened it as the Papilio line has been restored.”<br />
“Why would he do that,” Kushiel testing his jaw to see if it was broken; “that line died out during the rebellion.”<br />
“Beelzebub killed his father,” Raphael sensing Kushiel calming down but still wary of the inquisitor; “but his daughter Cruciata.”<br />
“Two demons here in heaven,” Kushiel screaming as his rage builds once more.”<br />
“No,” Raphael answering; “two new angels. Cassandra Papilio and Iris. If you want more,” Raphael turning his back to Kushiel; “you can always try to interrogate Jehovah.”<br />
“Why talk to him,” Kushiel snarling as he storms out of the temple; “when I have two demons to arrest.”<br />
<br />
Raphael watched Kushiel rush out before creating a communication portal.<br />
“My knig,” Raphael bowing; “Kushiel was just here. Demanding the demon we healed the other day.”<br />
“Even after I told him that she was a guest and to be afforded the same rights and protection as everyone else here?” Jehovah sounding nonplussed; “what did you say?”<br />
“The truth,” Raphael sheathing his two handed sword; “it was the only way to get him to leave without having to spill blood.”<br />
“So he knows that Cruciata and Pava are angels,” Jehovah smiling.<br />
“He doesn’t believe they are angels,” Raphael shaking his head; “once a demon always a demon in his eyes.”<br />
“Well he will be disappointed once he arrives at the Papilio estate,” Jehovah sighing; “Cassandra and Iris are enjoying a shopping excursion here in the capital. But I will send for some angels to intercept the two and provide escort in case Kushiel tries something foolish.”<br />
And I’ll be here to help tend to wounded,” Raphael nodding as the communication portal closes; “because Kushiel is so hot, he is liable to actually assault a fellow angel just to justify his convictions.”<br />
<br />
*******************************<br />
<br />
“So you are the new Custodia Ordins, “Stacy’s grandmother looking confused as she watched her granddaughter shift back into her imposing angelic form; “what is that?”<br />
“It wasn’t explained to me all that well,” Stacy answering; “but the gist’s are that the next Custodia would come before the next apocalypse. The previous one who was god’s mother died protecting creation.”<br />
“So like mother nature,” the young grandmother chiming.<br />
“Not exactly,” Charles jumping in; “But it does fall in line with protecting nature, which is part of creation.”<br />
“And get this,” Stacy chuckling; “my new angelic name is Gaia.”<br />
“Another name for mother nature,” Stacy’s granny getting up to make some tea; “sound right up your alley. After all you did fight corporations and rich fat cats protecting native land from pollution and resource exploitation.”<br />
<br />
Stacy smiled, yet before she could answer; she paused. Feeling a large welling of power surge through he; it vanished and she thought she could hear a faint voice along with it.<br />
“Ooh that felt strange,” Stacy shivering; “it was like I got slapped with raw primal energy.”<br />
“I didn’t feel anything,” Charles responding; “perhaps you are imaging things.”<br />
“I don’t think so,” Stacy shivering as the strange sensation comes back again. Only this time it came through stronger and she could hear a voice more clearly; before she fell into a trance.<br />
<br />
“The key to the cosmic power of creation has found its vessel,” Stacy droning in a deep voice of unknown origin; “prepare for the arrival of Enoch Morningstar the rightful bearer and host to light bringer.”<br />
<br />
Charles looked shocked as Stacy blinked looking confused at what she just heard and said.<br />
“Enoch Morningstar,&quot; Stacy looking at her fiance in total confusion”<br />
“My cousin,” Charles getting up; “Arch angel Michael Morningstar is my father who you will soon meet. However,” Charles looking serious, my uncle is Lucifer Morningstar. The Ruler of Hell; We need to head back, Jehovah and the council will need to know this.”</p>
