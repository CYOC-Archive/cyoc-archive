<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was bursting with excitement, though he was careful not to show it since he was going through a bit of trouble to keep up the rouse. All to avoid a whole bunch of extra work...<br />
<br />
Jeff briefly considered that now that the Chronivac was exposed and his dad was a notch or two down from being completely obsessed with improving Jeff, he could come out and say he figured out what the program did... but the goal was not to be involved and have to plan everything out. This left Jeff feeling like it was Christmas and he was about to unwrap a new, better, sexier body and a new exciting life of fun and freedom.<br />
<br />
Jeff went throughout the house to the bathroom, remembering the 20 foot radius and avoiding being under his bedroom, he got a good look at himself and his traits. Then he went up to his room and thought he felt an odd tingle upon entering but it was easily dismissed once he went to the upstairs bathroom and found no changes. Jeff retreated back to his room disappointed but unsurprised, he had stupidly specified weeks to months... Jeff retreated to his room watching videos on his phone, periodically taking stock of his room and body, just in case he was changing more significantly... but he wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
The next morning was the same as any other with the exception of Jeff looking for changes which he wouldn&#39;t find in the bathroom. Breakfast was the same, school was the same, his friends were the same, classes were the same. When Jeff returned home however, his dad&#39;s car was in the driveway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad? Are you home?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;m in your room.&quot;<br />
With a grunt Jeff dropped his book bag and headed to his room. &quot;Hey dad, you&#39;re normally working now, are you feeling okay?&quot;<br />
&quot;I took half of today and tomorrow off to work on that personal project I had told you about. Actually, since I believe I have things set up I might as well tell you...&quot; Mike discussed the Chronivac explaining how he put the pieces together, what &#39;his project&#39; was, but none of the specific changes he was going to make... Jeff found it all unbearably boring and was apathetic to the whole worthless discussion. He knew all this already, trusted his dad to get him in the ballpark of where he wanted to be, and he can tweak things afterwards. &quot;So, since you are my project, I made it so... Jeff are you paying attention? I made it so you won&#39;t care about the program until I&#39;m done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s fine, I already told you I won&#39;t mess with it... in this case myself, until you&#39;re done. I&#39;m not sure if you did something to me for this but I&#39;m on board with learning new things and becoming a better person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, I&#39;m really happy to hear that, we can start now. Why don&#39;t you play some video games for a few hours to relax after school, do your homework, and meet me in the kitchen to get dinner started?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I have a lot of homework to do and as much as I&#39;d love to game, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be done until its almost bedtime considering I&#39;ll need to stop to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds like you just need to be three people at once.&quot; Dad said with a light chuckle and a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, wouldn&#39;t that be some... thi..ng?&quot; Jeff said as a wave of disorientation struck him and he staggered. When his senses cleared there were two copies of him. Jeff was surprised but was quickly accepting<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, a Jeff for each task. I&#39;ll take this one for cooking, The two of you can split up the homework and gaming.&quot; Dad stood up and grabbed the soon to be cook.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... I have algebra 2, biology, reading, and psychology homework to do, and it wouldn&#39;t hurt to pre-emptively review the current and next chapter in history... Mr. Chambers loves pop quizzes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad smirked, &quot;You catch on quick, that&#39;d be what 5 more? Sounds like a plan.&quot; Dad turned back to his Jeff clone and exited the room as the remaining two became disoriented and multiplied.<br />
<br />
After some bickering from upstairs a Jeff came down and grabbed the bookbag before returning upstairs and more bickering ensued. Mike looked at Jeff and smirked, &quot;Sad you&#39;re missing out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not particularly...&quot; Jeff replied. &quot;So what should we do for dinner and will we need to feed... all of me? All of... mes?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, we&#39;re planning on dinner for two. But we need supplies. Spaghetti sound good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You drive, you can use more time behind the wheel and practice parking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff and Mike headed to the store and eventually the other Jeff&#39;s settled on work to do and even the Jeff intended to game pitched in and helped with half the math problems. The two Jeff&#39;s dealing with the history book had different roles, one read out loud while the other took notes and the others settled into their task. They spread throughout the house, kitchen table, couch, reclining chair, bed, and kitchen barstool.<br />
<br />
Once Jeff and Mike returned from the store dinner preparation began, and the other Jeff&#39;s began completing their tasks, they retreated to Jeff&#39;s room and began relaxing, 2 played on the console, phone, tablet, and computer distracted three more, the pair working on the history review were the last to complete their work and helped to set the table before going upstairs to find all the normal distractions were taken and settled for watching and cheering on the Jeff&#39;s playing at the console.<br />
<br />
Within a short time dinner was ready and Mike was eating with a Jeff. The rest were upstairs having fun and the remaining Jeff was getting jealous of his clone brethren having fun while he was left having to run errands cook and then eat this whole time! &quot;Dad, can&#39;t I go? I want to play and relax like the rest of them get to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike chuckled, &quot;Just eat and be happy for them. You&#39;ll get to relax just as much as them, don&#39;t you worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dinner finished and the pair put the plates into the dishwasher, cleaned up the rest of the dishes and when everything was done Jeff said, &quot;Now can I go play with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just yet.&quot; Mike said, &quot;HEY JEFFs, COME DOWN HERE!&quot; <br />
<br />
A few seconds went by and things upstairs fell silent, Mike repeated himself and there was a ruckus upstairs followed by a thunderous storm of footfalls on the stairs as one by one all the Jeff&#39;s appeared...<br />
<br />
&quot;Touch one another and think about being one.&quot;  Mike said.<br />
<br />
 The Jeffs did so and a final Jeff was standing along with the chef Jeff who ate with Mike, &quot;Now the two of you.&quot; Mike said as Chef Jeff cautiously held out his hand...<br />
<br />
The two merged and Jeff was left standing... &quot;Woah...&quot; Jeff said as Mike smiled. &quot;Intense right?&quot; Mike commented as Jeff was reeling from the sensation. <br />
<br />
It felt good to merge, but more than that, he gained all the experiences from each of the Jeffs he ultimately merged with... &quot;I remember everything from each of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, It wouldn&#39;t do much good if you couldn&#39;t learn from all the experiences.&quot; Mike smiled.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled, &quot;I fought with myself a lot about the chores I&#39;d do... that was really pointless...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s probably one of the best lessons you could learn. Procrastinating when you will have to get it done regardless is just spending more time with it looming over your head. Some adults haven&#39;t seemed to have learned that.&quot; Mike felt a wave of pride wash over him as he realized he had just given his son an epiphany strengthening his work ethic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Check your ID&quot; Mike commented. <br />
Jeff realized he was 1 day  older and spent the rest of the evening processing a days worth of information as he continued playing video games into the night.</p>
