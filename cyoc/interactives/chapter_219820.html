<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, I didn&#39;t really wake up so much as become aware of my new surroundings. I tried to move, only to find that my body wouldn&#39;t respond. It felt...numb, somehow. Like, I could feel that I was lying on a bed. I could see a fan spinning on the ceiling above, and I could feel the gentle breeze of the a/c kissing my skin. But I couldn&#39;t move at all. My eyes simply stared straight ahead, forced to examine the ceiling. At first I thought perhaps I&#39;d woken up as a paraplegic - there was one time when I had spent the day as a girl in a wheelchair, and another time as a man with half my body in a cast. But this was different than that. Both of the times, I had still...felt alive, I guess you could say. Right now, I just felt...nothing. Like, I couldn&#39;t even feel my heart beating anymore - that was definitely something new. Was I perhaps something that wasn&#39;t human? But I could still feel that I had limbs - even if they wouldn&#39;t respond to my commands - and out of the corner of my eye I could just barely make out one of my hands and see a tuft of pink hair. <br />
<br />
I&#39;d been a lot of things, so I wasn&#39;t panicking too much just yet. But it was certainly an odd way to come to.<br />
<br />
I simply laid there for a time, unable to really do much of anything else. I wasn&#39;t even breathing. It gave me time to think of some uncomfortable possibilities - like, what if the body I was in had died and I was essentially...trapped in a corpse for a day? But that didn&#39;t quite feel right either. Like I said, I could still &#39;feel&#39; my body, but it felt...artificial. <br />
<br />
After an unknown amount of time had passed, the door cracked open. I instinctively tried to turn to look - but of course, I couldn&#39;t. Whoever it was, they locked the door behind them and began to undress. It sounded like a girl. She came into the corner of my vision, biting her lip as she looked down at my body. She was young - either in high school or college, though it was hard to tell exactly. She had piercing blue eyes and wavy blonde hair. She was beautiful to be sure. What was going on here? Who was she, and who - or what - was I to her?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey cutie,&quot; she said in a low, sensual voice. &quot;Did you miss me?&quot;<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t respond, of course.<br />
<br />
And it became apparent she didn&#39;t expect one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeahhhhh, I bet you did,&quot; she went on, giggling softly. She began peeling off her halter top, exposing her sizable chest and a sexy black lacy bra, which was quickly removed as well. She sat on the edge of the bed and reached over to put a hand on my chest - I could feel her touch, feel bits of my body jiggle a bit in response. So whatever I was - I still had body parts. I just...couldn&#39;t move them. What was I? I was starting to have an idea. This was certainly a new one. Even in my inert state, I began to feel a gnawing sense of want and desire desire. <br />
<br />
The girl finished undressing, and then positioned herself over my body, looking down at me with lusty, half-lidded eyes. She took some lotion and began lathering me up. I felt my boobs jiggling far more than they would&#39;ve been in my regular body - and in an odd way. They felt totally fake. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I was getting a pretty good idea of what I was. A sex doll of some kind. It made sense - no ability to move, but still human like. <br />
<br />
I had a lot of questions. Who was this girl? Why did she have a sex doll? That was more of a guy thing, I&#39;d always thought. Not that I&#39;d really given much thought towards sex dolls before. Why would I? I never would&#39;ve imagined I&#39;d end up as one. <br />
<br />
But the questions were pushed out of my immediate worries when she leaned forward and began kissing her way up my chest, up my neck, and then passionately on my rubber lips. The weight of her on top of my synthetic body sent pleasurable tingles running up and down my inanimate body; even though my body wasn&#39;t alive, it seemed as though I could still feel pleasure. Well, at least this wasn&#39;t going to be a boring experience.<br />
<br />
And boring it was not. She began to make out with me, grinding herself against my body. God, I would&#39;ve given anything to move, to be able to return the actions. She tied her hair back and went to town on my plastic pussy - mentally, I was crying out like a squealing schoolgirl, wanting more, more! It felt so good. I wish I could&#39;ve returned the favor. I don&#39;t know who you are girl, but holy fuck, I would rock your world if I could! But she seemed to be doing just fine at turning herself on. Her breath was hot against my neck as she ground her pussy against my own rubber clit. My silicone boobs were squished comically down to either side as she lay on top of me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you were real,&quot; she whispered in my ear. &quot;I wish I was brave enough to come out...the thought of anyone finding out about this...about me living out my fantasies with a sex doll...&quot; She let out a sigh. <br />
<br />
I wished I was real at that moment too, for multiple reasons. One, I was starting to feel bad for the girl. Apparently a closet case of some kind, she was obviously lonely and struggling with her queer identity. Maybe she lived in a conservative state or had really controlling parents. And two, I was so fucking horny, that if I&#39;d been able to move, I would&#39;ve rocked this girls world. Just once, I wish I could defy whatever curse had taken a hold of me and moved. Even in this overly exaggerated form.<br />
<br />
She was quiet for a bit, casually playing with my hair - hot pink, of course. Probably a wig or something. And then she let out a sexual purr and began to start it up again. God! This girl was totally going to drive me crazy. Whatever I woke up as tomorrow, I hoped it&#39;d be animate, because I would REALLY need to masturbate after this. <br />
<br />
I also hoped that this girl would give me some kind of clue as to who she was, or where we were. Because if I could track her down in a body that was alive - a female body, of course - I would be ALL too happy to really rock this girls world, as a living girl instead of a silicone doll.</p>
