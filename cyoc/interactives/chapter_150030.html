<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">--Author&#39;s Note: In adherence to the guidelines above, I&#39;ll do my best to describe the setup for this storyline. The Main Character of note:<br />
<br />
Selicia Luxdorn, Self-proclaimed yet still able to prove her boasts, Archmagus. She keeps her physical form at prime &quot;age&quot; with a well endowed physique but, just enough to keep it tasteful. She&#39;s rather condescending and yet smooth enough to cover for it. She likes to make her clientele or victim believe that they&#39;re in control of what their asking for. She won&#39;t correct or warn of any loopholes within their request as she wouldn&#39;t want to &quot;taint&quot; their truest wish. Getting caught in the act or manipulating the request is nothing to her as she is too much for most to handle. If her ire is raised however she often does whatever first comes to mind. Often times the result is rather simple, more so if her temper is completely lost. She prefers to keep face as it were so the result will make it so noone will find out.<br />
<br />
Physical Appearence: She keeps herself at a rather tall 6&#39;7&quot; as to look down on others literally. Long black hair reaching down past her waist and a light tan to her skin. A mesmerizing quality to her blue eyes pairs with a perpetual smirk. A large bust (DD) accentuated by her dressing in ways that leave little to the imagination. She&#39;s not partial to makeup as she believes it hides what she&#39;s so carefully crafted.<br />
<br />
Her specialty lies in subjects of Lust especially. This can cover a broad range of subjects as everyone has their likes and dislikes. Above all, she is not above and will in most cases twist a spell granted to another to suit her. Having not much else to do with her free time often leads to her &quot;helicoptering&quot; her recent victim-tele. She might not be in a said chapter personally but, she&#39;ll be keeping close tabs on the happenings. <br />
<br />
About the only things I&#39;d rule out are subjects mostly frowned upon in the world over. I.e. If they&#39;re too young they&#39;re made to be old enough, to put it Selicia&#39;s way, that young and they have no real appeal like an unripened fruit. Otherwise, I&#39;ll just keep to my own line of her, maybe you&#39;ll see her differently, I&#39;d like to see what and where she goes without me. Hopefully I&#39;ve satisfied the criteria and this will stay around a while. Without further ado, here&#39;s Selicia&#39;s potential debut.--<br />
<br />
Story begins in what would roughly be the middle ages. Selicia has yet again run into trouble with the local authority. She is confronted inside her own Treeborne home on the Kingdom&#39;s edge. The brave knights enter the domicile leaving a cadre of mages outside to seal her away at any cost. As it would cause difficulty otherwise, the proceedings have been roughly translated for your leisure:<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is the princess, we know you have her!&quot; The Lead Kingsman loudly accused Selicia as his men stepped into the room holding their weapons threateningly at the &quot;witch&quot;. &quot;Out with it now, we&#39;re done playing your games! You will tell us or we take what we need out of you by force!&quot;<br />
<br />
Selicia lounged in her chair laying over its arms, legs crossed air as she pulled another grape from her bowl. This chair in particular was one of her favorites, solidly built, sturdy, and with just the right amount of plush. Poor man had asked her to help him be more supportive of others. Well now he was and here she was receiving the latest threat in the series over one of her other clients. She languidly set her eyes on the Lead Kingsman and smiled warmly as if regarding an old friend. &quot;We&#39;ve been over this Renault, I don&#39;t have her, not anymore. She&#39;s been sent back to your kingdom ages ago. How many times must we visit like this until the allegations are cleared?&quot; She plucked another grape as she eyed the other members arrayed before her.<br />
<br />
Renault sputtered at the sheer audacity of the witch and her seemingly lax nature of the situation. &quot;We&#39;ve scoured every corner of the Kingdom, Witch. Every Town, village, and boons have turned up nothing! You claim to have returned her and yet, she is nowhere to be found, just why else would that be?&quot; He drew his own weapon which caused a gleeful cackle from Selicia as her eyes filled with an unreasonable mirth. <br />
<br />
With a dismissively casual wave of her hand, Selicia dealt the first blow against the lesser Kingsmen around her. She smile akin to one a predator would give a cornered prey, eyes practically sparkling with amusement. &quot;You presume to threaten me? With what exactly? It seems they can&#39;t even handle the equipment they brought with them.<br />
<br />
Turning about to see what she had referred to Renault noted grimly that the men he had brought with him were already dispatched. Arrayed around him were group of women of varying shapes and sizes struggling with their ill-fitting armor. Most notably and quite possibly because of his brawny form, the largest of his cadre had become the daintiest among them. Their eyes filled with a mix of emotions ranging from shock to dismay told him that they were still of their own mind. He turned back to Selicia attempting to keep his anger in check, all he had to do was keep her attention on them just long enough. &quot;For the last time tell us, where you have her. I&#39;m enough to handle you alone. Men, leave us, you&#39;re no longer fit for this task.&quot; He watched as they bowed their heads to him leaving, two had carried another who was to shocked to move with them. Their equipment was strewn and abandoned on the floor.<br />
<br />
Watching the once-men leave the room, Selicia allowed herself another outburst of laughter. She did so try not to shame those she so kindly gave a new lease on life but, other times she couldn&#39;t help herself. Her focus turned back to Renault and she resumed her pleasantly calm demeanor. &quot;As many times as you demand it, I will not be able to produce that which you ask. I am not in possession of particular object in which you seek.&quot; Noticing the quickly hidden smirk on Renault&#39;s face, she guessed correctly that the spell working against her finally took effect. She glanced toward her feet seeing them turning to stone, not even marble, just stone. She rolled her eyes and sighed at the atrocity. &quot;At least let me pose in a manner befitting myself.&quot; She stood up from her chair giving its arm one last caress goodbye as she laid out on the table between them. Choosing a sufficiently seductive pose, she gave Renault his first gift.<br />
<br />
Renault had been a Kingsman for most of his life and retired from service with honor. With the princess having gone missing, he returned to service for this last deed to his king. As such, age had had its way with causing aches, weariness and balding that he hid gladly in his helm. Seeing Selicia accepting her fate however, worried him far more than it should have. He gripped his weapon more firmly than he had in years. This whole situation was somehow giving him far more vigor than the last, maybe it was seeing justice finally done. An itch on his scalp however became too distracting, his helm clattered to the ground and hair brushed his gauntlet. Stunned, he looked about for a mirror, it did not take long to find one. He ignored the the wood carved in the image of a young woman holding it as he inspected the young man within. <br />
<br />
Surely it couldn&#39;t be, he was a youthful man again. Much more than that he had a striking figure that he did not as a lad. He turned back careful to not let the witch see his jubilation at the proceeding. By now, Selicia&#39;s thighs were trapped in stone and her eyes told him that she was already aware of his glee. &quot;This is how you beg for your life? Now, you seek to what? Bribe me with youth and expect me to spare you? You would sooner turn the world backward.&quot; His sneer was rebuffed by her absolute refusal to show fear.<br />
<br />
Keeping it down to a small chuckle, Selicia regarded Renault as he admired his change in the mirror. Would it change his mind on this verdict he brought upon her? No, she knew as much but, if this was to be the last of her fun for some time, let her do so. &quot;No, no, you have me all wrong, Dear. You now have a bevy of beauties to look after, I merely gave you the body to keep up.&quot; Her smile widened as he fumed with realization, weapon raised at the ready to strike. &quot;Ah-ah.&quot; She waggled her finger resting it against her stone stomach. &quot;Kill me now and the princess&#39;s location dies with me.&quot; That did the trick, he seemed to remember his duty and rested his blade.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you finally admit to having her. Where is she?&quot; He peered around the room they were in trying to find a hint of her anywhere within. Each sidelong glance to Selicia gave him a sight even more jovial than the last. &quot;Out with it! Where do you have her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Selicia giggled like an air-headed youth with the secret she held for so long. The stoneform had reached her chest so she supposed she would tell him. &quot;She is here in a way and yet she&#39;s also many, many other places at once. You see, she came to me with a plea to help your kingdom&#39;s plight. Too many promises, not enough gold. Now, she herself was worth a King&#39;s Ransom obviously as here you are. Knowing that, I helped her by making the exchange with her. A beautifully crafted gold statue melted down into thousands of glittering coins settled the situation. I sent the coins to your king and he distributed them saving his kingdom. Of course, I made sure they&#39;d remind everyone where they had come from.&quot; A large grin slid across her face as she finished the explanation.<br />
<br />
Confused by this confession, Renault hesitantly opened his coin pouch and inspected a few of them coins. Some of them were of the large supply of which she spoke. There on the coin was the form of a nude woman displaying herself provocatively, so much so most ignored the figured prudishly. He pulled it closer to his face to make out the finer details of the figure. There before his eyes was the missing princess or at least a piece of her. The witch hadn&#39;t lied about not having her or sending her back to the Kingdom. With the plight so great, they had spent their princess to save themselves. His weapon dropped to the floor with a clatter as he stared at the nearly completed sealing of Selicia. All that was left to change was those knowing eyes filled with such mirth as to ruin him for life. <br />
<br />
With the sealing complete, the cadre returned to the Kingdom with the news. The King with great fury and indignation ordered the burning of the Witch&#39;s forest and a tomb erected around the preserved form of the fiend. Many of the victims were left to the fate of the forest unable to be released. A stone tomb was built and sealed to keep incidental release from happening. So it was for a thousand years, the Kingdom fell to infighting and the tomb was forgotten in the minds of the people. Until, an intrepid duo of grave-robbers found and broke the seal.<br />
<br />
&quot;You find anything on your side?&quot; The eldest of the pair spoke as he searched another nook.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing... Maybe that statue is the only thing in here?&quot; The youngest responded eyeing the creepy statue that seemed to be staring at him. It looked as if it knew there was nothing and was gloating at them. He got up from his crouch to inspect the statue, it was well preserved and finely crafted for sure. He cupped the free breast feeling out the detail even slipping his hand down further. He jerked his hand back as his partner had been watching him. &quot;Seems like this is it...&quot; He knocked on Selicia&#39;s head with the flashlight to emphasize his statement. Unaware of the crack that it had caused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I know you&#39;re lonely but, can&#39;t have you getting horned up over a rock. Rots your brain when you think only with your dick... Don&#39;t go hitting it again either, if its well made enough it&#39;ll be worth more whole...&quot; The Elder of the duo chastised the younger all the while unaware that the crack was growing rapidly in the dark behind them. As he opened his mouth again to continue, he was interrupted by the sound of falling stone. &quot;Now you&#39;ve gone and done it, its probably in so many pieces its worthless. I knew I should&#39;ve left...&quot; He was interrupted again but, this time by an all too unfamiliar yawn. Turning his flashlight toward the statue revealed a beautiful woman sitting upright and stretching languidly before opening an eye toward him. <br />
<br />
Selicia loved a good stretch after a long nap and judging by the two in front of her, it was the longest she&#39;d ever had. The was a must in the air and she felt a tingle on her chest. She eyed the younger of the two with an annoyed expression being as he was closest, it was likely him. With a flick of her wrist, the young man began to panic as his body unraveled at his feet traveling upward at an alarming rate. The unraveled strands reformed around her waist becoming an old fashioned pair of black panties leaving nothing of the young man behind. She adjusted them on her hips and regarded the older man before her. &quot;So... What time is it?&quot; She smacked her lips taking a deep breath as the man had froze seeing what she&#39;d done. <br />
<br />
The eldest graverobber watched as his younger cohort came undone like a spool of yarn. Now, the demon was speaking to him wearing his former compatriot as a pair of undergarments. For once in his long life, he felt like he&#39;d gotten in over his head. He turned to escape the way they&#39;d come in and seal it back up before it got loose. Sadly, that meant living the other behind but, it was a sacrifice for the betterment of them both. He&#39;d turned to leave as he heard a sigh followed by &quot;I can&#39;t go out looking like this...&quot; It was the last thing he&#39;d ever hear as a human being as he too changed. His limbs and head pulled inside his torso which bloomed out like a flower below. Soon after he felt lighter as his body hollowed out and thinned to a soft fabric. He fluttered to the ground and lay there unable to move more than a scrunching of cloth. <br />
<br />
Selicia walked over to pick up the new satin slip made from the older man. Enjoying the feel of the fabric, she slipped it on over her head and grimaced as the cloth scrunched up on her chest. He had some fight in him for his age she&#39;d given him that. &quot;You&#39;re so much feistier than your little friend. He gave up the moment I finished, guess he&#39;s quite content down there. Though, I can&#39;t have you moving in public... If that were to happen I&#39;d have to burn the offender...&quot; That seemed to be threat enough as the cloth released its grip. &quot;Good boy, now let&#39;s see where or when we are, hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
She climbed out of the tomb by the rope ladder left behind and surveyed her surroundings. It had been long enough that the tomb was mostly buried and covered in grass, the forest she called home was long gone. She sighed and sought out with her magic the closest civilization. It was roughly an hour before she touched on a large cluster of people some ways away. She willed herself toward the area stopping roughly a few miles from it. It wouldn&#39;t do to scare too many, bad for business. Thinking of business, the first order on the list was to find a suitable location to set up shop. So she would begin there and hope humanity hadn&#39;t become too moral over the years. With a casual smirk, she sauntered forth toward civilization to begin anew.</p>
