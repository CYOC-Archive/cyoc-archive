<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the day that Sammy and Gloria&#39;s eggs hatched, Sally and Charlie lead Brent into their home. Fluffy, Mary, Janice, and Snowflake actually followed behind them as they had followed  their parents home. They eventually made their way into a kitchen/dining room which had a large back window where the sounds of cheers of children could be heard. Sally briefly looked out to see Lia and Luna out there as Pinkie, Rena, Diamond, Marta, Marka, Mardi, Baton, and Parish were playing backyard volleyball.<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice... why don&#39;t you and your gurlfriend take Fluffy and Mary out and join the others in the volleyball game,&quot; Sally said to the eldest soughter that shi gave birth to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, mom,&quot; Janice replied. Shi wanted to groan, as shi hadn&#39;t truly begun &quot;dating&quot; Snowflake, yet, but then, shi also really liked Snowflake and just about everyone knew that shi and and Snowflake had been great friends since they were infants. They were both twelve and turning thirteen wasn&#39;t too far away. It wouldn&#39;t be long before they&#39;d be in Janace High School where Talia and Midnight taught, along with various other teachers, and high school romance would follow. Though the biggest thing that Janice dreaded was &quot;the talk&quot; which shi guessed would largely come from Sally since Charlie had been born male and female puberty wasn&#39;t something Charlie would know.<br />
<br />
While Janice took Snowflake and the others out, Charlie and Sally moved to sit by their dinner table and Charlie motioned for Brent to come and sit nearby. Shi did so as the two Chakats settled onto their haunches.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wished to talk?&quot; Sally asked after a few moments, when shi was sure that the kids wouldn&#39;t overhear them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Brent nodded, &quot;About what happened in the Vatican.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally fought back a shudder. Shi was feeling better and was getting better, but what had happened there brought back the scars that had happened in Cairo.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think all I need is time, Brent,&quot; Sally said slowly, &quot;What happened to me in the Vatican was mostly a reminder to what had happened to me in Cairo... A... a group of Kats there got their minds back after burning through the lust phase of the virus, but they were already criminals and they deliberately raped me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie and Sally both watched Brent shudder. It went through hir entire body as hir exoskeleton wouldn&#39;t allow for only a part of hir body to shudder. It tipped something off to both Charlie and Sally.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Scorpkats in the Vatican were simply horny, not consciously wanting to rape someone,&quot; Brent told them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Sally slowly sighed, &quot;and to be honest... I don&#39;t entirely blame them. If there was anyone I&#39;d really want to hurt out of it... it&#39;d be the scientist that decided to launch the outbreak... but still... it reminded me of what happened in Cairo and I just felt so helpless. Held there as they prepared to place spermatophores on the ground and then rub me in them, and all I could do was... was kick with my rear legs, and that did nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that made you feel powerless?&quot; Brent asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sally nodded, &quot;It&#39;s the powerless feeling that makes me uneasy. It&#39;s not really you or your form. I just need time to feel fully in control again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that will be good news,&quot; Brent gave a smile, which looked weird as hir mandibles sort of tilted downward to indicate a &quot;smile.&quot; Charlie nodded quickly, and Sally did nod hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you wanted to help?&quot; Charlie asked, &quot;Can you help hir get hir power back? I can love hir and do anything I can to ease whatever is bothering hir... but I&#39;m not sure on what else to do...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of that is simply to talk and let time heal the wounds,&quot; Brent admitted, &quot;but some of that would also be to reach out to others with similar experiences. They can provide a level of understanding that someone who hasn&#39;t been raped can&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you raped in the Vatican?&quot; Charlie asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Brent said slowly, &quot;Like Sally, I was grabbed by a Scorpkat just as the cloud burst and people began transforming. My clothes were torn off and its pincers cut my arms. Shi then held me under hir and used hir hands and hir own female &quot;openings&quot; to mate with me and then smeared a spermatophore into the wound inflicted on my arm. It&#39;s only after that that I went into a lust filled haze that I didn&#39;t really come out of until Charlie stung me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie and Sally sat quietly and let Brent continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless, I did still feel helpless... especially since that as a guy... I really didn&#39;t think of myself as a target for rape, the fact that I was, obviously proved that wrong, and if I still had sexual organs that would be recognizable to a vertebrate, they would be scraped up a bit. Not non-functional as they do still work... think like they&#39;d be sore after over use.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I didn&#39;t know,&quot; Sally spoke, realizing that Brent had more in common with hir than shi thought. The form may remind hir of hir own pain, but on some level, Sally knew that Brent had no real choice of what kind of Kat shi became. Just as shi and Charlie had no choice in what kind of Chakats they became back in the Fee City outbreak.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were pretty shook up by what had happened in the Vatican and by the fact that the scientist essentially raped Charlie&#39;s DNA in his little revenge plot or whatever,&quot; Brent spoke, &quot;telling you this then wouldn&#39;t have helped while you were in a more fragile position and half worried that your mate was being taken from you. I didn&#39;t want it to become a &quot;woe is me&quot; contest... the Scorpkats and Spidkats in the Vatican had no control over themselves and the only thing that really got to me was the fact that I had not control in the situation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Charlie to hir sither. Sally nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be,&quot; Brent nodded, &quot;it will be... and since you&#39;re starting to get over what happened, I figured now was the time... especially with other things that are likely coming up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other things?&quot; Charlie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m pregnant,&quot; Brent said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pregnant?&quot; Charlie gasped.<br />
<br />
Sally&#39;s gasp was silent and hir eyes widened in surprise. Brent was just like hir. Shi had been raped and was impregnated as a result.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can feel the eggs forming within my... within my &quot;taur&quot; half... and I don&#39;t know how many eggs are in there,&quot; Brent said weakly.<br />
<br />
Brent wanted to say more when both Sally and Charlie rushing forward and hugging hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, being a mother isn&#39;t that bad,&quot; Charlie told hir, &quot;I&#39;ve actually enjoyed it... nursing Pinkie and then Fluffy and Mary. They are such little darlings and you&#39;ll love their baby pictures... and we&#39;ll help if you decide to be a mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be,&quot; Brent said slowly, &quot;mostly because since giant insects and arachnids haven&#39;t been around for quite a few epochs, no one&#39;s figured out how to do an abortion for them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll help you raise them,&quot; Sally spoke, &quot;and we&#39;ll help you with anything you need. The rape in Cairo did make me feel weak and vulnerable, and it&#39;s not fair that anyone for ANY reason made you feel the same way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brent felt a bit better, as getting that all off hir chest did seem to help Sally a bit more, and shi didn&#39;t want to admit it, but it also made hir feel better two. Shi then hugged Charlie back with the arms that held hir pincers and then hugged Sally with the arms that held hir hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you told mom?&quot; Charlie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve actually been too nervous and would like to know for sure,&quot; Brent admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I know what we&#39;re doing tomorrow,&quot; Sally spoke, &quot;Mina or Ronnie can do the blood tests to see if you&#39;re pregnant. We&#39;ve had about a month since the Vatican outbreak... if you are pregnant and will lay eggs, it should be evident by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brent nodded but did have a slight shudder to hir. The only spots where a syringe or dart could pierce hir would be in areas where the joints of hir exoskeleton met, such as hir neck, the hinge in hir pincers, and where every army, hand, finger, leg, and tail joint was, and even there, it wasn&#39;t something that could be done easily. Shots did hurt, but figured that some truth might be important.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next day while Charlie and Sally took Brent to have hir blood tested for pregnancy, Jess and Nikole made their way to the home that was built for Casey and Ryles. The union between Jess&#39;s former pet and Jess and Sally&#39;s aunt (their mother&#39;s sither) had been a sweet one. Casey remained very much the explorer and occasionally did call Houston to see if NASA had found any planets that they thought might support life. Some of the answers were surprisingly positive, but also tinged with the fact that they were light years away and Earth had no technological means of getting there. Ryles, in gaining a Kat&#39;s lengthy lifespan, had proved very playful, just like Jess remembered hir being when Ryles had been a young fox. In a strange way, Jess felt a mother&#39;s pride in seeing Ryles so happy with hir aunt.<br />
<br />
As shi made hir way in with Nikole, Silky, Foxy, Heather, Shasta, Flake, Alexis, and the new Elise entering, shi found Jess, Casey and their family. Ryles was presently pregnant to the second time and looked ready to give birth any day now while Casey looked more slim, but shi had laid hir second clutch of eggs after a two month pregnancy. It was smaller than the first clutch, at least with regard to the eggs that actually contained baby Rattlekat/Foxkat hybrids. Seated in front of Ryles and Casey were the children that had hatched from Casey&#39;s eggs or that Ryles gave birth to, Trenta, Maras, Sinasta, Missa, Rissa, Jissa, and Kiran.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are Charlie and Ssssally?&quot; Casey asked as they all came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they took Brent to the clinic, we couldn&#39;t get them in time before the appointment,&quot; Nikole answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Issss ssshi okay?&quot; Casey asked, concern evident in hir voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;We think so, but Brent didn&#39;t tell us specifically what is the issue,&quot; Nikole said slowly, &quot;I&#39;m sure shi&#39;ll tell us when shi&#39;s ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Casey acknowledged that and then looked back to hir eggs. <br />
<br />
They lay in a sort of pillow nest that was very similar to the one that Sammy and Gloria had built six years before for their own eggs, but there were obvious differences between Casey&#39;s eggs and the eggs of Janace&#39;s two Dracokats. Casey had been glad to find that Kats of any species could breed with each other, provided their &quot;equipment&quot; could match up. And in that regard, Casey and Ryles only JUST made it in that way. Casey had one penis between hir rear legs, but as with snakes, it ended in not one but two &quot;heads&quot; which Ryles insisted was twice as fun. This hadn&#39;t been the big surprise in hir reproductive life as a Rattlekat. The big surprise was that shi laid eggs. While most people figured that since they were reptiles, rattlesnakes did lay eggs. But rattlesnakes were actually among a handful of species that that gave birth to live young.  In fact, Casey had even found that all of North America&#39;s pit vipers (rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths) gave birth to live young, odd for a reptile, but it was true. Hir trivia search also found out that some sharks, like the Great White (which Torrent&#39;s DNA was based off of) also gave birth to live young, defying what was common. So, Casey had been heavily surprised when shi laid eggs.<br />
<br />
Eventually though, Maurice and Snowy had run some genetic tests to see why and to make sure that Casey was healthy. Despite carrying the outward look of a Western Diamondback Rattlesnake (with arms, four human-like legs ending in very human-like feet) they also found that part of Casey&#39;s DNA was taken from the Speckled Kingsnake, a nonvenomous constrictor (which also ate rattlesnakes in nature) that also lived in Texas. Maurice guessed that when whichever Sang Lt. or hired scientist mixed the DNA in with the virus for the Houston outbreak the work was done sloppily and some of the different animal DNA strands hybridized thanks to the nature of the virus they were being attached to. It proved that Casey was healthy, but that shi laid eggs because part of hir DNA came from a different species of snake that did lay eggs. Maurice and Snowy also found the Kingsnake&#39;s natural immunity to rattlesnake venom in Casey&#39;s bloodstream, and soon found it in all of hirs and Ryles&#39;s children. Casey then made the joke that shi didn&#39;t have to worry about biting hir tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will they be okay?&quot; Heather asked curiously looking to Casey&#39;s elongated eggs that unlike Sammy and Gloria&#39;s eggs which had a bird&#39;s egg like shape and texture Casey&#39;s eggs were more leathery and they could see the new hatchlings pushing on them from within. Heather was obviously too young to remember when Trenta, Maras, Sinasta, Missa, and Rissa, &quot;They look like they&#39;re rippling...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s how they hatch, dear,&quot; Jess said to hir soughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;But the Robins that nest in the birdhouse don&#39;t hatch like that,&quot; Heather commented, referring to a birdhouse that Jess and Nikole kept in their backyard that attracted a family of Robins that lived there in the spring and summer.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are birdssss,&quot; Casey told hir grand niphew, &quot;not all eggs hatch the same way. Reptile eggs are more leathery and do not crack open the way bird&#39;s eggs do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re not reptiles, they&#39;re cousins,&quot; Heather said with great certainty.<br />
<br />
That raised a lot of chuckles, as both were right. Casey and Ryles&#39; children were the cousins of Charlie and Sally&#39;s children and Jess and Nikole&#39;s, but that didn&#39;t cover their animal DNA base that determined their Kat form. Though, Jess and Nikole were proud that their soughters put family OVER any genetics concerns... though they were still rather young. Much of this was due to youthful innocence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here they come,&quot; Ryles announced as suddenly three triangular heads shot through the leathery shell of their eggs.<br />
<br />
The rest of the new hatchling&#39;s bodies followed as they twisted their bodies to widen the opening that had been made in them. Once their shoulders were out, they reached out with their hands to try and help pull themselves out, and their forelegs shakily joined in doing this until the three new hatchlings were all out and their bodies beginning to dry from the natural fluids found inside eggs that had nourished them after they had been laid. One looked like Fennac based Foxkat, though with hir fur being in the colors and pattern of a Western Diamondback Rattlesnake. One looked like a Rattlekat, but hir scales were the creamish-tan color of a Fennec. The third seemed to be  a mix of a Foxkat and Rattlekat. Shi had the head shape and legs like Casey&#39;s, but shi had fur on hir dorsal side, a fox&#39;s tail, and definitely hir father&#39;s ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwwww...&quot; Silky and Foxy said together, &quot;They look cute Aunt Casey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t they,&quot; Casey smiled and brought a small wash cloth to clean them and then lay down, coiling hir body around them so that any attempt to crawl away were met with their mother&#39;s scales.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, any thought on names or...?&quot; Jess wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we agreed on Sara, Janet, and Missy, but I forget which eggs would be which,&quot; Ryles admitted to Casey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ssso do I,&quot; Casey gave a hissing chuckle, &quot;But it doesn&#39;t matter... they&#39;re here with usssss now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone nodded in agreement.</p>
