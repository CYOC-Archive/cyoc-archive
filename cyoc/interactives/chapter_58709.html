<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bartender stretched out a warm and moist towel to Jesse who cautiously grabbed it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Could use some cleaning up, I thought. If you intend to stay the evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, damnit.&quot;, he lifted up his overhanging belly with one paw and hurriedly wiped his crotch <br />
with the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;But congratulations son, you're now a real werebear. And a pretty impressive one to boot&quot; , he <br />
said with feel, as Jesse was not too far away from the same height and bulk as the bartender <br />
despite his low age in comparison. He looked around 35-40 or something. &quot;Just leave it on the <br />
floor and kick it under the bench, someone will take care of that later. However you and I need <br />
to take a talk after the pub closes regarding your new you,&quot; he said and gestured at the whole <br />
of Jesse. &quot;The thing is, the Animal Revealer only works for as long as you stay on this island-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;, Jesse said, completely amazed at his own baritone voice that made his throat rumble as <br />
he spoke much too loud, making several heads turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ssch!&quot; he said and put his muzzle close to his and looked at him right in the eyes and said <br />
with a whispering voice, &quot;It's not like I decide how to run this place, it's a safety procedure <br />
understandably. It was created back when that guy-turned-tiger mauled those customers. But I'm <br />
willing to help you gain the form. Permanently, if you'd like.&quot; Jesse was amazed at how his <br />
muzzle moved as he spoke. The bartender looked smug.<br />
<br />
&quot;The island commitee had most of the old brew disposed, but I keep a stash hidden, you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bartender, how about 'em drinks now!&quot; someone shouted from behind Jesse. The bartender <br />
smacked his forehead and nodded, rang a bell hanging overhead and roared a name that made the <br />
crowd go silent for a moment, as another employee came back from cleaning up the tables, entered <br />
the bar and began to serve the customers. Then the bartender leaned back towards Jesse again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Name's Frank.&quot; said the bartender and reached out a paw which Jesse shook. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesse.&quot; <br />
<br />
Then he saw Frank reaching his paw to his left as Jesse noticed Teresa seated beside him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Teresa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See? I was right before about that lady-friend.&quot; said Frank with lopsided smile.<br />
<br />
Jesse looked down at her as she began to rub his paunch sensually again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm... seems like it.&quot; Jesse replied with a slight discomfort on his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Won't really last outside your stay here though I'm afraid. I can smell that she's a nymph.&quot; <br />
<br />
Teresa smiled innocently at Jesse. She stopped her rubbing and leaned back to her chair. &quot;Well, <br />
I wasn't lying back then; I was waiting for someone like you. Can't help myself when it comes to <br />
the burly... or 'bearly' types for that matter, it's just that so far they all seem to come in <br />
the homosexual variant lately. But hey, I may not be able to leave the island but I can always <br />
show you a good time while you're here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse gave the nymph a long hard look and then realized something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! You're not that woman who called out for me to transform earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I figured you'd like a brunette considering the long stare you gave her.&quot; she said and <br />
quickly shifted her hair blonde and curly then back again. <br />
<br />
Jesse cowered back in fright with arms held up in a protective gesture from her, and looked <br />
wide-eyed at Teresa, looking quite ridiculous as the massive beast cowered in shock. He then <br />
heard a hearty chuckle from Frank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Hedonia! Or of course, as it were in english; 'Pleasure Island'. Don't read too much <br />
into it, they're all around the place to ensure the customers have a good time, no matter shape <br />
or form as you just noticed. Conjured up of course and not able to leave this island, but they <br />
really know how to pleasure anything on two or on occasion; four legs. And son, your expression <br />
right there was priceless&quot;, Frank roared with an outburst of laughter and Teresa giggled.<br />
<br />
Jesse brought his clawed hand towards his muzzled face and did his very first (and many more to <br />
come he realized) 'facepaw'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, just enjoy your stay until my shift ends at 1 AM, then I'll help you,&quot; he glanced <br />
sideways to Josh who was apparently socializing with someone with an ordinary beer in his hand, <br />
&quot;and perhaps your friend there too, if he'd so desire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Jesse said perplexedly and looked back at Frank. &quot;Why are you doing this for us?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's not everyday I see a straight werebear - lets be honest - and most certainly not one <br />
who strips down to his very last garment in front of a crowd and well...&quot; he slowed down in his <br />
speech noticably and bobbed his head in rhytm, &quot;that which came after, of course.&quot; Jesse <br />
groaned. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have some guts son; that's why I guess you fit into this form of yours like a glove.&quot; Frank <br />
friendly punched Jesse's paunch and let out a boisterous laugh again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I am not the kind of type of person... or well bear to be precise, to stand between two <br />
friends so your friend Joel-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Josh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh, damnit, I usually never miss a name... anyway Josh is getting the same treatment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Frank, really.&quot; Jesse clapped his hands together and leaned forward into a barely <br />
noticable bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome.&quot; Frank grinned, his fangs glistening in the light from the bar-scene behind <br />
them. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll give you guys a bit more info later, but for now I think your friend Josh has waited long <br />
enough for his change, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, but before I get back to work, here's... lets see... five more beers for the 'bearly <br />
man' over the counter on the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's all too much!&quot; Jesse exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no it's quite literally too little for your new body; I'll make that eight.&quot; he said and <br />
laughed loudly while he began to tap large glasses full of glistening amber beer, foaming <br />
perfectly to the rim of the glass. <br />
<br />
&quot;With a hint of honey of course.&quot; Frank said and winked.<br />
<br />
Staring at all the beers standing before him like the impenetrable wall of China, Teresa put a <br />
hand on his thigh, arousal buzzing through him again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there Mr. Bear, if strike out on that brunette and want some more, just give me a call on <br />
this number while you're here,&quot; she slipped him a note written on the backside of a receit, <br />
&quot;preferably tonight.&quot; She said with lust dripping every syllable to the point of oversaturation <br />
as she squeezed his member making him moan lowly. <br />
<br />
She slipped out and with a sexy walk made her way through the crowd before shifting appearance <br />
and disappearing completely out of sight. Without thinking, Jesse sniffed with his broad nose <br />
and caught the last whiff of her scent and then embarrased took another sip from his glass. <br />
She's a seductress... he told himself as he emptied the first glass, but that other girl from <br />
before however really caught his attention. He looked above the heads of several dozen of people <br />
talking and drinking but couldn't catch her face. His heavy head landed on the counter and he <br />
sighed, but then he saw something through the bubbling glasses. Almost unnoticably Frank slided <br />
a handbag behind them and then swiftly was out of sight at the other end of the bar (how did he <br />
do that?), but instantly he smelled through the fragrant beer the sensual smell that he somehow <br />
knew was hers. He took both paws and shuffled the glasses to the sides and gave the bag a whiff. <br />
<br />
Jesse chuckled. He had her scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;'Sorry miss, seems like you misplaced this'...&quot; he said so low only he could hear, but he <br />
caught Frank smiling at the other end as he obviously kept an eye (or ear) on Jesse, before <br />
coughing and turning around grabbing some bottles from the shelf. <br />
<br />
Jesse eyes wandered and found himself looking at Josh's back turned to him as he were talking to <br />
someone, when he suddenly saw a bulge from Josh's backside which was pushing out the fabric. He <br />
placed his beer back on the counter and with a clawed finger he took the waistband of his pants <br />
and pulled them down to see the beginning of a tail sprouting. Josh was too drunk to even take <br />
notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Josh!&quot; Jesse said and tapped him gingerly on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
