<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Emily could respond to Rick her phone buzzed from a text. Emily put the camera on a nearby table to check the text. The text was from her model friend Amber. The text was asking if Emily was free to come over to celebrate the inuguration of the new photo studio and that she was free to bring a one-plus. Emily smiled as an idea came into her head.<br />
<br />
Emily told Rick the contents of the text and said he should come over as he is now. <br />
<br />
Rick was abset about this and made it clear he dislike the idea.<br />
<br />
Emily picked up the camera and messed with the settings before taking a quick photo of Rick. The big titted Rick was replaced by a more average looking women. Emily smiled, feeling less jealous of Rick while also sending a clear message to him/her. <br />
<br />
Rick blinked recovering from the flash and noticed he is still a woman. Looking up at Emily perplexed he asked &quot;what did you do?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I just changed you to be more average and I think this should make it clear, that since i&#39;m holding the camera I can change you to much worst things.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rick never seen Emily so threatening. He was about to speak when Emily interupted him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick come on, it will be fun, plus you can go to the womens washroom and look at all the women there.... I promise not to get jealous, but now touching yourself.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rick thought about it, Emily does have a point in that nobody would suspect him of being a man and nobody would mind him stairing at them as a woman. Rick relented and agreed. <br />
<br />
Emily smilled happily at Rick&#39;s acceptence. They headed out to the studio. On the way Emily asked Rick what would he liked to be called by while at the studio. <br />
<br />
Rick was a bit taken aback having thought that she had turn on the reality alteration option. Emily made it clear she didn&#39;t as she respects Rick as her boyfriend enough to not go that far, just to get want she wants. Rick smilled back at her, happy knowing how much his girlfriend cares about him. <br />
<br />
Rick answered Emily by saying she could call him Rikki, while at the studio. Rick then asked what Emily&#39;s plan was. Emily just shushed him saying it was a suprise.<br />
<br />
They arrived at the photo studio and they meet Amber at the door. Emily introduced Rick as her friend Rikki. Amber lead them into the studio where it was decorated festively for its opening. There where only at the moment the owner and photographer of the studio Gabriel and Amber the model, beside the newly arrived Rikki and Emily.<br />
<br />
While they waited for the other models and their friends to arrive, Emily asked Amber if she could get Gabriel to take a photo of the four of them with her vintage camera. Amber said sure and went to ask her boss. <br />
<br />
Emily quickly messed with the settings turning on the reality alteration, she then made sure she would be partially aware of the changes. Her main desire was to change everyone and their relationships to each other and the four of them were a good test. <br />
<br />
Emily made it clear to Gabriel that he shouldn&#39;t mess with anything on the camera and just set it up to take a photo of the four of them. Gabriel being the pro that he is accepted Emily&#39;s word and with a tripod set up the camera to get a good angle on the four of them. Gabriel then went to join were everyone was while Emily went to set the timer for the shot. <br />
<br />
Emily joined back the group and the camera took its shot. <br />
<br />
Emily looked to her left and saw her pregnant bimbo wife Gabriel. <br />
<br />
Gabriel was now both a model, photographer and owner of the studio. Her tits were the size of her head and her honey blonde hair reached her ass. Gabriel was pregnant with Rikki. Gabriel was wearing a very slutty looking wedding dress. Gabriel was now 16 years old and was 5 foot 7.<br />
<br />
Emily then looked at herself, her mind telling her her body was different, but not the fact Gabriel shouldn&#39;t be her wife. <br />
<br />
Emily was wearing a wedding dress as well, except hers was more normal. Emily felt her clit replaced by a 7 foot cock. Emily was now 16 years old and 5 foot 6. Besides her breasts went from a C-cup to D-cup nothing else changed about her. <br />
<br />
Emily looked to her right and saw her and Gabriel&#39;s 1year old daughter Amber.<br />
<br />
Amber was in a bean bag chair. Amber was in diapers. Amber had honey blonde hair like Gabriel.<br />
<br />
Emily feeling the lust of a teenager decided to have some more fun with the camera and her wife. She grabbed her daughter at took her to her stroller, while she told Gabriel to stay were she was and get ready for a good fucking. As Emily took Amber to her stroller, Emily noticed that the decorations changed from congratulating the opening of the studio to congratulating them on another child. <br />
<br />
Emily put Amber in the stroller and stripped naked. Emily remembered it was her idea to wear the wedding dresses for a photo. Emily saw her hard cock and felt a stronger urge to shove it into the love of her life Gabriel. Emily returned to see Gabriel lying on her back and having removed only the parts of her slutty wedding dress that covered her lactating nipples and access to her dripping wet pussy. <br />
<br />
Emily went to the camera and altered what would be changed. In her heat Emily didn&#39;t realized the changes of the previous settings. <br />
Emily wanted to feel the changes as they happen, while they fuck and wanted Gabriel to feel them as well so she set he camera to take multiple pictures rapidly. Emily made more changes then set the timer and began fucking her slutty, but loyal wife Gabriel.<br />
<br />
What does Emily change them into</p>
