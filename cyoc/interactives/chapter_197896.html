<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;d already been working on a Dino City - Spring Break chapter... and well, I was far enough along that I didn&#39;t want to start over...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not all of the original Animalia Ambassadoria cast returned to Lyre/Animalia for Spring Break. For Sophie, Roland, JC, and Pauline it was actually easier and cheaper to go down to Dino City for the week. It was closer to where they went to college at SMU and wouldn&#39;t require a flight, which was there for Christmas break, or a several days drive as what they had at the end of the summer to start the college year and in May to start the summer. It was also something that came with an added benefit as Spring Break began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, this will be amazing!&quot; said a blond-haired young woman that Sophie had made friends with as four Dinotopians met her at the doorway to one of the sophomore dorms on SMU&#39;s campus, &quot;the whole town is still open for tourism and all full of Dinotopians like you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... not just like us,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;aside from Roland and I... there are only four other Pterosaur and they&#39;re all of different species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I think only three of them actually live in Dino City,&quot; Roland added.<br />
<br />
Sophie watched as the blond smiled and nodded as she led them her SUV. The girl was another sophomore, but one that Sophie had both one of her law and economics classes and they had forged something of friendship, and one that had also enabled Sophie to find out that she&#39;d been a fairly big fan of Animalia Ambassadoria, though more for some of the side antics and jokes than for anything serious related to Animalia and Animalians. The girl&#39;s name was Ezri Duke and seemed sweet enough and had taken up some interest in looking over Dino City for the week and had asked for Sophie and Roland to give her a bit of a tour. The two of them accepted as it would be an opening for some relaxation and for the two pairs of bond mates, the time for more personal fun that wasn&#39;t there on the college campus. Sophie was very certain she would marry Roland and that Pauline would marry JC, but both of their parents had urged waiting on that until after college, which meant they couldn&#39;t take residence in the &quot;married couple&#39;s&quot; dorms that the campus provided.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll still be fun and could have all sorts or reenactments of Jurassic Park scenes,&quot; Ezri commented, &quot;It’d be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d be more that you&#39;d get opportunities to learn on science and things like that,&quot; Sophie warned, &quot;or get a punk rock concert in the evenings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ezri shrugged and hit the unlock button on her key fab, &quot;It could still be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The drive down to Dino City took a while, even with the main highway that was there. It was something that showed just how big Texas was as a state and the group found that the Skybax was a bit more crowded as they arrived in Dino City and indicated that there were more that came to Dino City or Glen Rose for Spring Break than was otherwise expected. Sophie doubted this was for scientific study and more college students thinking that Dinotopians and Animalians there would be open to “exposing” themselves in some way, which many would likely take as a surprise. Animalians might not be as self-conscious about nudity, that didn’t make them interested in public nudity. That was one of the weird things that some people still seemed to have, even more than four years after Animalia was formed.<br />
<br />
But it was there and thankfully, the four Dinotopians and Ezri had rooms booked in advance and that it wasn&#39;t too hard to get their keys to the hotel rooms that were part of Skybax Heights in Dino City and then moved to make their way toward the central elevator. As they reached the door, a familiar figure came out. Quetzal still towered over Sophie and Roland, which made sense as Quetzalcoatlus was regarded as the largest Pterosaur to ever live, though some of its relatives in Europe were comparably big. The bigger surprise was the male Quetzalcoatlus that came out with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophie... what brings you here?&quot; Quetzal spoke with a surprised gasp, &quot;moving in already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... We’re all part of the Spring Break mob that&#39;s come in,&quot; Sophie answered while gesturing to the group that was waiting to check in at the front desk, and then gestured to Ezri, &quot;this is Ezri Duke, she&#39;s come down with us for the week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... all the college fun,&quot; Quetzal chuckled, &quot;well, don&#39;t party too hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not today, anyway,&quot; Ezri promised, &quot;we just checked in and were going to put our bags in our rooms. From there... there was a tour of the sites to see in Dino City.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... you seem to have found someone new,&quot; Roland commented looking to the male Giant Azhdarchid Dinotopian with Quetzal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... he isn&#39;t someone new,&quot; Quetzal smiled a bit, which Ezri noted that like Sophie, only the very corners of Quetzal&#39;s mouth could smile, as her beak was hard bone. Though unlike Sophie and Roland who had teeth, Quetzal did not. &quot;He&#39;s just a bit different from when you first met him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie and Roland traded glances as JC and Pauline also came forward, curiously sniffing at the male Quetzalcoatlus Dinotopian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; he said with Fred Timm&#39;s voice, &quot;it is good to see you again Ms. Albers and Mr. Luwrie.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four Dinotopian college students could only blink. Ezri only looked to them with some surprise as she wasn&#39;t sure as to where this surprise from them all came.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would appear that Tyra wasn&#39;t the only one to win over a paleontologist,&quot; Quetzal commented, &quot;and Doctor Timm has helped with a fair number of things and has proved quite accepting... so in time... things just developed to where things went forward to where some very nice things followed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Quetzal&#39;s been teaching me to fly as well,&quot; Fred Timm added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations,&quot; JC spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully you two will be as happy as Tyra and Rex are,&quot; Sophie then managed, &quot;where are you off to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now? Just some shopping,&quot; Quetzal smiled again, &quot;and we&#39;d best leave you to getting your rooms... The week for Spring Break will go by quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quetzal and Fred Timm then moved on while JC, Pauline, Sophie, Roland and Ezri then entered the elevator to take things up to their rooms. Their reservations had assured they were all on the same floor, but couldn&#39;t get them next to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... are you friends with everyone here?&quot; Ezri asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know a fair number of the Dinotopians here, but much of that is more by reputation,&quot; Roland answered, &quot;The ones we&#39;re actually friends with is far fewer. We know Quetzal from the flight lessons we gave her and Buzz last year. The rest is limited to Jeremy and Heather Greene... and her grandmother Tyra and her husband, Rex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t that the one who put you in the hospital, Sophie?&quot; Ezri asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... or at least not me,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;Heather did show up in Lyre and attacked. But the one she roughed up was Roland.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was the one sent to the hospital,&quot; Roland agreed, &quot;but Sophie found that being a Dinotopian was possible and ultimately found that there was more to Heather&#39;s actions than just some sort of stereotypical villain. Thus, as Heather was reformed, Sophie made friends and I went along with her. As she was smart and focused bac then too. And cute... I... well, I fell for her even before we became Dinotopians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This will make for a fun week,&quot; Ezri smiled.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The tour of Dino City ultimately went well, and Ezri had shown a great deal of curiosity at things as Sophie and Roland showed her where Dino City&#39;s Horizon Light and Labs building was, along with some of the other sites to see. The public-school building was a surprise, given that until recently, all of Dino City&#39;s residents were adults. And even with the hatching of Dino City&#39;s first clutches of eggs the previous calendar year, the hatchlings were still infants. It would thus be years before anyone would actually need the school district for Dino City. Sophie explained that as part of the city planning that given that many of the first Dinotopians were larger than other Animalians, that once they started having children and they reached school age that they would be too big for the furniture in the Glen Rose School District. Though, like WSA, in Lyre-Animalia, the Dino City school district would be open to Dino City&#39;s residents, Human or Dinotopian, and even some Glen Rose residents could &quot;open enroll&quot; once the district was ready to open.<br />
<br />
From there, Sophie then showed Ezri some of the other sites, including the turnoff that led up to the state park where Rex and likely Fred Timm would give lectures and presentations on both the fossils there at the site and with regard to natural history in general. They also passed the Dino Dome, though by this time it was closing for the evening and the group was soon on their way for an evening meal and then returning to their hotel rooms at the Skybax Heights. Sophie and Roland both heavily noted Ezri&#39;s amusement and curiosity at the sizes everything was in Dino City and that how even Sophie, Roland, JC, and Pauline seemed small next to some of the furniture and things that were there. It was an ultimate reminder on how not everything from the Mesozoic Era was massive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I think Ezri will enjoy the week,&quot; Roland said as they entered their room, &quot;and there may well be plenty of things to learn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And probably some things to laugh at,&quot; Sophie commented as she thought back on their walk back. <br />
<br />
They&#39;d seen a couple male students, who Roland recognized from one of the fraternities at SMU hounding a pair of raptor Dinotopians, one looking like its feather patterns matched an Osprey. Eventually one had had enough of the taunts and jabs and gave a screeching &quot;roar&quot; at those students. It was amusing, though even the frat boys didn&#39;t lose complete interest. It left Sophie wondering if they made the right choice with this, but so long as Ezri didn&#39;t get into anything that would cause trouble, Sophie ultimately felt it would be worth it. The two of them shared a fair number of interests and had become good friends, almost as good as her friendship was with Jessica, Sarah, Malice, and Abby was. So long as Ezri was fine with things, Sophie supposed things would work out.<br />
<br />
And while Roland went back into the room proper, Sophie moved over into the adjoining bathroom and retrieved her birth control pill case. She loved Roland and did want to lay his eggs in the future, but that future wasn&#39;t there yet. She wanted to get through college and potentially get a bit of a start on what would lead into a proper career. Until then, while sex was fun, Sophie made sure she remained on her birth control pills. She removed one from its case and laid it on the counter will then filling one her reusable plastic cups with water and then using it to down the pill. From there, Sophie then returned to the main room to find Roland seated on the bed and having gotten his shirt off, which made her smile a bit.<br />
<br />
Roland would never have the bulk muscle that Samson did, and to a degree, he probably wouldn&#39;t match Simon or Travis, but he was still well developed. Especially now as an adult, and Sophie knew that his wing muscles were very impressive and at times gave her the sense that he could carry her in the air if need be. Some of the thoughts of that also raised the question of them being able to mate in the air if they could find a place with enough open uninhabited land to &quot;do it,&quot; which was enough to get her wet at the thought of that. Roland taking his shirt off also enabled Sophie to get a better look at the blues and bluish accents in his crest and pycnofibers, that instinctively Sophie increasingly was drawn to more and more after their conversions.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here he is... my wonderful bond-mate,&quot; Sophie smiled, &quot;looking all buff and getting ready to make passionate love to his mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re coming into season...&quot; Roland said slowly, stating what he and Sophie had found out since their conversions.<br />
<br />
When he and Sophie first became Dinotopians, they were only just completing their sophomore year in High School. Sophie had grown from a large A to a modest B cup into a small C cup just in the transformation and her hips had flared out a bit. As they matured into adults, Sophie took on the proportions that just about every Animalian female had. Large and perky breasts, a relatively narrow waist, and wide hips. Proportionately, Roland knew that Sophie was smaller than Jessica, but a lot of that came from the need to &quot;save&quot; weight so as to fly. It didn&#39;t change that as an adult Pterodactylus Dinotopian, Sophie had grown into a curvaceous and sexy Dinotopian and as she posed before him, even with her top on, he could see that. They&#39;d also found that like all the Animalians that laid eggs, Sophie came into season in the spring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sophie said as she climbed up on the bed and catching a growing scent of arousal from Roland, &quot;but I took my pill. So there is no need to worry about an unplanned pregnancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is good,&quot; Roland said as he nuzzled his crest to Sophie&#39;s and then moved to undress her, making sure that her shirt didn&#39;t catch on her wings or anything else, &quot;our parents may accept our being sexually active now as adults... but I don&#39;t think they&#39;d want to hear &quot;grandma&quot; or &quot;grandpa&quot; anytime soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sophie agreed as she folded her wings to let Roland more easily pull her shirt up and then tossing it onto the floor and exposing her erect nipples to the air of the room as they poked through the pycnofibers on her breasts, &quot;but don&#39;t kill the mood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; Roland answered as Sophie began to reach for the button to his pants.</p>
