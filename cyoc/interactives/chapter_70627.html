<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I'll go to Ashton's I think,&quot; Ty said to himself as he quickly called his friend on his smartphone.<br />
<br />
To his delight Ashton picked up. They'd always been close friends, and Ty was curious to see how their relationship was in this new reality. &quot;Hey Ty,&quot; Ashton said, &quot;Sup?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm comin' over okay? Just want to make sure you're up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? On a nice summer day like this? Shouldn't you be at the beach with your basketball friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
So apparently they were close, but Ty's popularity meant they didn't get to spend much time together. &quot;Dude, I got the whole summer to hang with the guys, we're going to hang today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay great! I'll be waiting,&quot; Ashton said and hung up. Ty hung up too and decided to go ahead and update his memories to suit the new reality. His guess was correct; he and Ashton had been friends since kindergarten, but as Ty started to show his physical and athletic skills and became more popular they had less and less time to hang out together. There were always people wanting Ty to help them with homework, or join a football or basketball game, or help practice karate or making a website or a number of other activities. And Ty never had the heart to turn away those who wanted help. Even now as a jock he was a very nerdy jock, and luckily his friendly attitude spread through most of his school, but that only made him more popular and gave him less time to hang out with Ashton.<br />
<br />
With these thoughts in mind he used his powers to teleport over a couple blocks to Ashton's front door. His knock was answered by a boy of about twelve with blond skater hair, blue eyes with a slim build and average height; Ashton's younger brother Nate, wearing red plaid shorts and a red polo shirt. &quot;Ashton!&quot; he called, flicking hair out of his face and heading down the hall to his room. Ashton's house was a single story, but had a basement that doubled as a second living room. Ty waited while his friend came down the hall. Ashton also had blond hair and blue eyes, but his hair was darker and short, not having any style to it. He was wearing blue plaid shorts and a gray graphic t-shirt and had a pretty average build.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man, how'd you get here so fast?&quot; Ashton asked, leading Ty back to his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I teleported,&quot; Ty replied simply.<br />
<br />
Ashton chuckled, &quot;Fine, don't tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No seriously,&quot; Ty insisted. &quot;I could hardly believe it to begin with, but this morning I passed out and had this weird dream, and when I woke up I had reality warping powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reality warping huh?&quot; Ashton asked, sitting down on his bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really! See these,&quot; Ty said, flexing his seventeen inch biceps, &quot;I used my reality warping power to get these. I used it to reshape my whole life into this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've always had a great bod like that,&quot; Ashton replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not form my point of view, I was average just this morning, I changed reality so I've had a body like this my whole life, and a mind sharper than everyone's at school, and everything really. Watch I can prove it,&quot; Ty said. He focused on Ashton. He was going to bring him up to speed, and he saw Ashton's amused expression turn to amazement when he felt and saw his muscles growing right on his body, causing his shirt to tighten around his expanding pecs and back, and his sleeves stretched and tore around Ashton's growing biceps. The process was identical to what Ty had gone through earlier, and when it had finished Ashton was now just as muscular as Ty, and as well endowed.<br />
<br />
Ashton stood in shock for a moment, flexing his own seventeen inch biceps and lifting up his tight shirt as he flexed his six-pack. &quot;Holy shit!&quot; he cried, &quot;You weren't kidding! Holy fuck! I have muscle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty cool eh?&quot; Ty asked, folding his own muscular arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;No kidding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate walked back down the hall past Ashton's room and burst out laughing when he saw his brother, &quot;Dude, why the hell are you wearing such tight clothes? Going to a gay bar or something?&quot; Nate teased before heading off to the washroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;He has a point, can those powers fix my clothes?&quot; Ashton asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah sure,&quot; Ty replied, quickly willing Ashton's clothes to resize to fit him, &quot;Well that's another reality change,&quot; he added, realizing that he had access to a new reality's memories.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I see what you mean,&quot; Ashton added, realizing he had a second set of memories too. Now Ty and Ashton still had less time for each other, but it was because of their mutual popularity. People wanted both of them for different things and neither could turn down the offers, but they were both known for their great sport skills and grades. Ashton was captain of the swimteam and soccer team, while Ty was, in the previous reality as well, captain of the football team and the wrestling team. &quot;Why don't we both go hang out with some of the guys?&quot; Ashton asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, why not?&quot; Ty said, &quot;Oh, let's bring Nate and Dustin too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, maybe you can buff them up.&quot;</p>
