<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i> Meanwhile at the farm </i><br />
<br />
Alex was amazed. The &#39;wood&#39; that needed moving were mostly felled trunks, not the fully chopped logs Alex had pictured. But with the vigor running through his veins, lifting was easy. He  hoisted a log above his head,  biceps bulging with strength as blood rushed to his pecs, further accentuating their mass. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;d I tell you?&quot; Cael said with a grunt, raising his own log above his head &quot;That vigor does wonders for your strength. While I can handle logs like these on my own, with that skinny frame you had, there&#39;s no way you&#39;ve been any use.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex grinned. &quot;Feels pretty fucking good to handle this much weight, I gotta say&quot; As he&#39;d been working, the sheer pleasure of being able to hoist the trunk of a tree, or a stone boulder, was almost intoxicating. His muscles were not just strong, but perfectly balanced. He felt no ware from the effort, and as he went his strength only seemed to grow. &quot;Shame this stuff wears off, I&#39;m getting pretty used to having this mass&quot;<br />
<br />
Cael looked over at the boy, eyes studying his form. <i> Really does look good in Roy&#39;s clothes. Could use so more mass, but that outfit accentuates what he has perfectly </i> He thought. <br />
<br />
Cael&#39;s eyes traced over the pair of mounds Alex&#39;s slightly unbuttoned shirt revealed. Below, the gentle mounds of his six pack barely showed, and from behind a thick bubble butt squeezed against the log&#39;s weight. Caal, who&#39;s orcish muscles went far beyond anything a vigored-up human could attain, straddled his own log with just one arm. This left his other hand free to wend its way to his crotch. Gently, he began to stroke his bulge as his eyes hungered. He was drawn to Alex&#39;s ass in particular. <i> Swear the boy&#39;s ass has only gotten bigger since we started. That vigor sure thickened his glutes nicely. </i> He licked his lips as the pleasure of his stroking increased. <br />
<br />
Alex, for his part, was fully aware of the orcblood&#39;s ogling. A grin crossed his face as his cock hardened, a tent forming in the tight confines of Roy&#39;s clothes. Alex noted that he wasn&#39;t usually so quick to get aroused, especially when concentrating on hard work. Since he&#39;d landed in this world, however, he found himself hornier than usual. And increasingly so.  It was starting to seem like he had developed a sort of baseline horniness: The arousal was always there, always looking for an outlet, and always waiting to make him hard. <br />
There was something different about this world, something that seemed to demand lust. Lust was starting to feel almost inescapable. <br />
<br />
&quot;Over on that pile should work&quot; Cael said. With a grunt, the man launched his log onto the top of a growing pile next to his house. <br />
<br />
Alex, lacking Cael&#39;s orcish strength, had to carry the log over himself. From behind, Cael admiring his form as he squatted to lower his load.  To his astonishment, as Alex&#39;s glided into a squat, his gluts seemed to thicken. They were growing before his widening, hungry eyes.  It was as if the universe was beefing up Alex&#39;s muscles in response to the strain. <br />
<br />
<i> That&#39;s curious. </i> Cael thought, <i> I *thought* his ass seemed bigger. Vigor doesn&#39;t normally thicken muscle after the initial change. Somethings different about this batch. </i> <br />
<br />
Alex turned to face Cael, the tent in his pants on full display. He felt the orcblood&#39;s eyes lock on it immediately. Back in his own world, Alex was never bold with his sexuality. While he enjoyed sex, he&#39;d never have exhibited himself so openly or taken such a bold lead in showing off his arousal. That said, he&#39;d always had a yearning to be more exhibitionist, more bold, more open - yet couldn&#39;t  muster the courage. While he&#39;d been working, however, something seemed to be changing about his thoughts. With each train of his muscles, each grunt he was finding himself feeling bolder, more sensual. It was as if this world wasn&#39;t only driving his arousal, but drawing out his inner sexuality, Shaping him into someone kinkier, more open, a match to the ranging sexuality of this world. Little did he know this was the first sings of the changes that would mold him to match this world. While his deep desires already fit this world, they would have to be brought, accentuated, out for him to match. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, looks like that batch of vigor&#39;s doin&#39; more than just filling up your muscles&quot; Cael said with a grin.<br />
<br />
Alex gently groped himself, eyes studying the orcblood&#39;s form with increasing hunger. &quot;How can I not get hard working next to so much beef all day&quot; Alex didn&#39;t know where this bold new self was coming from, but it felt so good. His other hand traced down his chest, feeling the muscles heave with each inhale, enjoying the power his pecs contained. His cock twitched in respone, new form fueling his increasing arousal. &quot;Got any more vials? One feels so good...&quot; He flexed an arm to demonstrate &quot; but with two I could be a beast!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cael stepped forward, the two now practically chest to chest. Alex felt his cock brush the tip of the orcblood&#39;s much larger tent. It twitched as anticipation rose. Alex looked up, the orcblood looked down. They both grinned. The orcblood&#39;s eyes turned to Alex&#39;s flexed arm. His hands clasped against it, taking in the left as they dragged along the thick bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Fraid I&#39;m fresh out. Thankfully, we&#39;ve got a pair of &#39;taurs next door who can make some more.&quot; Beneath his fingers, Cael noticed the bicep thicken. It seemed to almost grow to compensate for the lack of available vigor. Part of Cael was increasingly concerned. This wasn&#39;t right... vigor doesn&#39;t have such an effect. Yet another part of him - the stronger part - couldn&#39;t resist the alure of the boy&#39;s growing muscles. He gave the arm a slight squeeze, then released. <br />
<br />
&quot;Taurs?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really are a city boy.&quot; Cael responded, eyes once again locking on Alex&#39;s. &quot;Everyone knows vigor is minotaur&#39;s milk. To get results like these you need the essence of pure beef. thankfully, the &#39;taurs are usually quite willing to share. Milking, I hear, is quite sensual.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex felt the man trace his nipples, an unexpected pleasure shooting from them. <i> Did I get more sensitive? </i> Alex thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;We can stop by the &#39;taurs place shortly, but how &#39;bout for now we let of some of the heat from all this work&quot; Cael&#39;s hands moved lower, gripping Alex&#39;s cock. The boy winced,  gluts tightening in response. Alex felt Cael&#39;s thumb drag across his length; his hips bucked slightly. It felt so good, and he was so horny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly what I was thinking&quot; Alex whispered as he gripped Cael&#39;s bulge and leaned his free hand on the man&#39;s chest.  One against the other, eyes locked. The two found themselves pause for a moment. Beneath his hands Alex noticed the powerful beating of Cael&#39;s orcish heart and the somewhat heightened pace of his deep breaths.  The air filled with nervous, excited, silence.  While both were overwhelmed with arousal, there was an unexpected tenderness in this moment. Something about their closeness felt comfortable, right. A spark of smoothing more had seemingly lit between them. <br />
<br />
Without words, they turned and broke the moment. Hearts beating, pants straining, they had priorities. Both slowly walked towards the house.</p>
