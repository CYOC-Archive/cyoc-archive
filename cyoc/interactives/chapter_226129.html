<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I squinted down at the report through my tired eyes, rubbing one paw over my plump cheek in frustration, I&#39;d uncovered nothing. As I delved into the report, my hopes of uncovering any evidence to support Max&#39;s claims of mistreatment quickly dwindled. There was no indication of improper behavior from the owner&#39;s side, and it became apparent that Max had indeed caused damage to the cargo. With a heavy heart, I sighed, and my large rabbit ears drooped in a mixture of disappointment and frustration. The report provided no solutions, so we were back at square one.<br />
<br />
Resigned to this reality, I carefully returned the document to its original place, sliding it back into its designated spot with my paw. It was reminiscent of Mercurius&#39; dismissive words in his memory when he first received the report, referring to it as just another typical accident involving damaged goods. Those comments weighed heavily on my thoughts.<br />
<br />
Silently and with great caution, I locked up behind my fluffy tail and waddled off into the night, ensuring my infiltration left no evidence. <br />
<br />
It was time to ditch Mercurius&#39; body in his own house, pretending nothing happened. Drawing from Mercurius&#39; memories, I recalled that his residence was nearby, offering a convenient location to part ways with his physical form before he woke up. <br />
<br />
As I waddled my way towards Mercurius&#39; residence, my belly jiggled with each step and my breathing grew heavy. Mercurius&#39; stamina is no match for Max.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a surge of stirring coursed through my mind. I could sense my host stirring from the depths of his blissful slumber. I controlled my movements with utmost care, ensuring that there was no physical stimulation that could disturb his dreamy state. Lowering my long rabbit ears, I caressed and whispered enchanting fantasies, weaving an ethereal web to keep him rooted in a state of ecstasy.<br />
<br />
The rich clothing that covered my body still contained Max&#39;s lingering aroma, acting as a powerful tool - I brought the collar up to my nose for a grateful inhale. He moaned lustfully as the dreamy state seemed secure for now. <br />
<br />
However, the attraction became too enticing and drew me in as well. My thoughts started to wander, and I found myself daydreaming about my gorgeous wolf, imagining his strong paws running their fingers through me. I nudged my furry cheeks to bring myself back to reality, and I managed to keep my eyes on the road. <br />
<br />
I creaked open the Mercurius&#39; doors with its owner&#39;s paws, ears perked as I surveyed Mercurius’ collection. Rubbing my chubby belly, a mischievous plan formed in my mind—I would disguise tonight&#39;s events as a continuation of his recurring drunken coma dreams. It was a risky gambit, but it may provide the ideal cover for my actions.<br />
<br />
I approached the wine cabinet, carefully selecting the strongest liquor available. Holding the bottle to my twitching nose, I took a deep inhale of its sweet fumes before tilting it skyward. The fiery liquid warmed its path down my throat straight to my toes, and already the room spun on its axis, enhancing the authenticity of my performance. In an audacious move, I splashed more onto my fur, the inky stain deepening my disguise. <br />
<br />
My clothes fell away with fumbling paws, and the fabric&#39;s lingering scents of Max would be discarded and evidence of intimate contact with Max would be removed. This would all be but an indistinguishable dreamy memory for Mercurius.<br />
<br />
I lolled back on the plush carpet with a drunken woozy grin. One of my fluffy paws groped at my swelling crotch, and the other rubbed my soft belly, making sure Mercurius immersed himself fully in arouse and spirits. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet dream.&quot; I whisper one last time using this voice and dispel my Possession. <br />
<br />
It only took a few seconds for me to reappear in my body, and I was half-kneeling beside Mercury without feeling much. With the faint light, I saw the chubby naked rabbit continuing to entertain himself with a face beaming with bliss. I quietly slipped out of the room, taking the evidence of tonight’s infiltration with me. I felt a surge of joy, knowing that I had completed my mission successfully.<br />
<br />
As I walked away, a sense of relief washed over me, and I gradually regained my own identity. It had been a mere two days, but it felt like an eternity—a whirlwind of experiences that had left me disconnected from my own body.<br />
<br />
In truth, I should have expected this strangeness. My physical form now felt distinct from Mercurius&#39;, Max&#39;s, and even my former self. I feel heavier and warmer, and I have more vigor coursing through my body than I have in a long time.<br />
<br />
Now think about it, my eyes adjusted to the dim light in an instant. This must be a benefit of the Heritage Upgrade! Using the same low-night vision as Beastman, I quickly found and darted into an uninhabited dark alley, eager to examine myself<br />
<br />
My arms were the first thing that drew my attention; I couldn&#39;t get over how big and muscular they were. I reveled in the raw power coursing through my fingers and wrists as I rotated my hands. Each rotation of my arms allowed me to feel the muscle fibers contracting and relaxing. With a confident flex of my biceps, I felt them swelling and solidifying. My short sleeves were stretched to the breaking point, ready to rip at any moment.<br />
<br />
I was amazed at my newfound strength and wondered what else I could do with these guns. I ran my hand over my arm, surprised to feel the coarse hair covering it. Although there is no visible difference, it was denser than before, but not in a bad way that enhanced masculinity. With each squeeze, I reveled in the sensation of solid mass, thick and powerful.<br />
<br />
I peeled off my top, noticing how my better form strained against the tight fabric. I was astounded by how much taller as I carefully pulled it over my head. My once lanky body had transformed into a healthy athletic build, with well-defined muscles bulging where they had previously been almost non-existent.<br />
<br />
My entire torso was fit and strong, with each part being in proportion, despite my exaggerated arms. With a visible treasure trail over my sculpted abs, a surge of joy swelled within me at this boost Max had granted.<br />
<br />
I had always been scrawny and frail, but now I could feel strength coursing through my veins. Reaching for my phone for a makeshift mirror, I froze at the sight of the size difference that emerged - my hand became truly massive, nearly twice the size of my usual hand, with thicker fingers and a wider palm that could easily clasp my petite device.<br />
<br />
As I unintentionally turned it on, I noticed that time seemed to have stopped within its display. I hadn&#39;t checked the time before possessing Max, yet the stalled digits matched my estimate. Time has also frozen on my clothes, which are still stained by the sweat of yesterday&#39;s toilful march. Oh, I got distracted again.<br />
<br />
As I refocused my attention and stared at my reflection, a mesmerizing feeling grew within me. I see a strong resemblance between myself as a human, with the masculine traits of beastmen adorning my facial features, adding a bit of mystery and wildness to my bookishness. I groaned, tossed the phone aside, and urged both of my sizable hands to explore the inviting muscles that I couldn&#39;t stand by and watch.<br />
<br />
I traced the contours of my chest with one hand, fingers groping with newfound strength. I gently massage my nipples with my brush, the touch was electrifying, sending a wave of euphoria through my body. <br />
<br />
Moving my hands to my sides, I explored the broad expanse of my back, tracing the ripples of muscle that spanned across my shoulder blades. Any labor job should be simple for me to apply for.<br />
<br />
My fingers continued to descend along my abdomen. My palm slid over the taut, sinewy muscles that now defined my body. With each stroke, I could feel the well-defined ridges and valleys. They came across a washboard pattern of sculpted abs, each muscle fiber distinct and defined. The sensation under my touch was thrilling, inviting me to embrace my newfound capabilities.<br />
<br />
Never before had my body felt so overwhelmingly powerful, yet also alien to me. This caused a tingling sensation to grow below my waist, causing me to squirm with rising excitement. My dick hardens as it extends to full mast inside my pants, developing an obvious and painful bulge. That uncomfortable feeling helped me regain some sanity.<br />
<br />
I am shocked by my unusual new urge, where did they come from?<br />
<br />
My heart is racing in my chest, and I can almost feel testosterone being pumped into my veins by my testicles. It&#39;s making me feel excited and turned on so easily. I have never felt so full of lustful energy before, and this rushing surge must be what&#39;s making me feel so stimulated and aroused. I realized this is the boost from Mercury, that horny little rabbit!<br />
<br />
I measured myself by pulling my pants half down and squeezing my engorged genital. As expected, they are significantly larger, my balls and cock both grown in size and mass, quite a lot I would say. With manhood like this, I definitely would enjoy them more often. When I compared it in my head, it was still far from the largest one I&#39;d ever seen, which belonged to Max.<br />
<br />
As I thought about Max, the chill of the night air reminded me that he was still waiting for my bad news, which dampened my sense of contentment and sexual desire. I bundled Mercurius&#39; discarded clothes and tossed them into the trash, pulling my stained clothes back over my newfound curves.<br />
<br />
Walking from the alleyway, my grown-up frame found the familiar path while my mind wandered. How can I explain the bad news without upsetting Max?</p>
