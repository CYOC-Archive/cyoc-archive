<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, Jesse told his &quot;little brother&quot; who was five years older than him, that he would agree to go back to the fair. Jake was very relieved. He had actually cum for the first time thinking about his brother and his surging muscles. It was sick! How could he be getting sexually excited over his little brother? <br />
<br />
But he wasn&#39;t so little anymore. He was getting taller and bigger. Jesse now looked closer to 15 instead of 13. He had muscle for the first time, with biceps and pecs beginning to form. Jake had to beg the Madame Illusia to stop this now!<br />
<br />
As he drove, Jake kept looking over at his now extremely confident and mostly silent brother. Jake was getting pretty antsy. <br />
<br />
They got to the fair and sought out Madame Illusia&#39;s tent. She was busy giving a reading to a single woman and was talking very concernedly in hushed tones. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hate to think of doing this to my own husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah but your husband will enjoy being the younger man again! He will have virility!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, don&#39;t you think 13 is a little bit too young?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he think his 18 year old secretary was too young?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right. I&#39;ll do it. Thank you so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take my card in case you need my services later, the fair leaves tomorrow!&quot; The woman departed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me? Ma&#39;am?&quot; Jake approached her carefully, and had his cap in his hand. He looked apologetic. He used his most polite language as his brother nodded to the Madame with a confident smile. &quot;I just wanted to say how very sorry I am to you. I&#39;m very sorry. I was wrong and you were right. I was rude and ill-behaved. I have no excuse for my behavior. I very much want to make it up to you, Ma&#39;am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, well, this is a very different young man from the one who visited me a few days ago. No longer so very arrogant now that you have a shriveled boy dick that only responds when your little brother allows it. Not that he is so little. Why look at you, you look so strapping. I made it so that as the days pass your brother would grow from having a true man&#39;s virile member!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it feels amazing! I feel like I have so much energy! Way more than Jakey here. Isn&#39;t that right, Jakey?&quot; Jesse asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, that is true.&quot; Jesse said through clenched teeth. He hated being called Jakey and Jesse knew it!<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would you have me do? You do not enjoy this new life of yours?&quot; she asked. <br />
<br />
Jake looked up at her pathetically. His voice croaked from near tears. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, please give me my dick back, please I was so wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So! You have learned that sometimes the genetics you were born with are not the only thing that makes a man worthy? Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Yes, definitely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you now think of your brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s...he was nice and I shouldn&#39;t have been a bad big brother. But now that...he can be the only one to give me an erection, it&#39;s terrible. Please. I&#39;m not gay. I don&#39;t want to...&quot; Jake began to cry, break down over the stress of it all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I think you have learned humility. But, I will not change your brother back, he enjoys having virility, do you not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I do! It rules,&quot; Jesse agreed, touching himself and the outline of his enormous nine inch dick pressing against his jean leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;So. What are you willing to do for me that I should give you a large dick back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I don&#39;t know. What do you want?&quot; Jake was now scared. Before he thought of the old woman as just some old woman to push around but now he was getting flashbacks to Ursula from the Little Mermaid and he gulped. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to act your age and since you behaved like a child I want you to be one. So! I will return your dick to its normal size. I will make it so you can masturbate on your own. However, you still must do as your brother tells you to do. If you disobey him, your dick will shrink by one inch each time you tell him no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hell yeah!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In addition, I will now make it so you are fully 100% homosexuals. I do love gay men and you do want me to love you, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GAY? No! Please! Anything but that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, come on. Ain&#39;t nothin&#39; wrong with bein&#39; gay. Everyone is way more cool with it nowadays. And you can even legally get married someday if you want!&quot; Jesse added helpfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to give me straight in exchange for your dick and you will be your brother&#39;s slave in exchange for being able to use your dick on your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Slave???&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, perhaps that is a harsh word. Owner. Your brother will have to learn all about the mastery of another human being,&quot; she said to Jesse. &quot;i have a book here, called &quot;Introduction to Enslavement&quot; which I think you should both read. Now your brother will not just give you orders, he will also be responsible for you. He will have to be a true leader which means not injuring your brother in any physical way. If you beat your slave he will gain muscle and if you make him bleed his penis will grow an inch. BUT if you disobey Jesse it will be different and he can beat you all he likes and you will not grow at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both brothers thought about it for quite some time, about the myriad possibilities. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll be gay and...I&#39;ll do what my brother says,&quot; Jake said quietly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah! I&#39;m gonna be in charge!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not be gloating, young man. You will be a strapping young man in just a few days and will soon outweigh your brother and be much taller than him. You must not take advantage of those smaller than you, or there will be repurcussions. Also I am making you Jesse to be bisexual. It is a small price to pay to be a big muscular man. Now then, do you both agree?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse had to think about it, but he was very open and liberal and had no problem with gay dudes like his brother had, and he thought it might even be fun to have sex with guys.<br />
<br />
They did. The Madame Illusia made Jake strip his pants, in broad daylight in the tent. She closed the tent flap even though you could see their silhouettes. She went into witch mode and said some words in an ancient language and sure enough Jake&#39;s penis grew back slowly over a few minutes until it was nine inches long again!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank you! Thank you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank your new master for forgiving you for your many sins against him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting something, Jakey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master. I&#39;m your master now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have to call him Master, do I Madam?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is an appropriate title. You are his slave now. As long as he doesn&#39;t endanger you in any way. This is the rule. You must keep your slavery a secret from all, unless it is someone you very much trust, but you must both respect your new slave/master relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.........&quot; Jake said, pausing and trying to find the courage to say the word. &quot;master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t hear you, Jakey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well it looks like we&#39;re done here, Jakey. Now you&#39;re gonna spend the rest of the day teaching me how to drive. It&#39;s time I learned. I&#39;m gonna be a man in a few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Jesse stared at Jake threateningly.  &quot;Yes, Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good. Now both of you get the hell out of my tent. I need to make preparations for leaving tomorrow! My work is so much, it is never done!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake got into the passenger seat of the truck as Jesse, his 13 year old brother got into the driver&#39;s seat and smiled. &quot;Things are gonna be changing a lot, and soon, baby brother.&quot;</p>
