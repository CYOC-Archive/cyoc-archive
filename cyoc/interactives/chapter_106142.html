<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;WOO HOO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Matron Ritter was momentarily cheering for his Friend and semi-crush, Kevin Chase, over at his bench at the stadium, staring at the audience with a wide smile as he watched at the Asian male perform his sick moves at the stadium. <br />
<br />
The fellow moved to the United States a year ago is trying to fit in, having moved in from a multiracial community and is getting used to the new culture. Luckily , his fellow Asian friend Kevin helped him settle in.<br />
<br />
&quot;WOO HOO!&quot;<br />
&quot;RAWRRRRRR!&quot;<br />
&quot;God damn the crowd is so loud.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course the crowd would go crazy over this event, especially seeing as this event was Organised by one of the most popular clubs in the school, dance motion. <br />
<br />
He placed his ear buds to his ear and jammed to his music, hiding beneath his orange hoodie as he wore a plain white V-neck underneath. Along with a pair of grey pants and a pair of slip in shoes. His black locks grew Long into bangs as his natural brown irises stare at his Friend in the performance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh a new challenger!&quot;<br />
<br />
He remarked, seeing a tall, Asian male. Maybe Indonesian or Thai? He wasn&#39;t so sure. But there was without a doubt that the man had awesome dancing skills when he danced on stage. Along with the rest of the crowd , he clapped in amazement.<br />
<br />
Now it was Kevin&#39;s turn...and for some odd reason. He suddenly looked beat out, as his movements became less swift and suddenly<br />
--He stopped??!! Why did he stop??<br />
<br />
He took off his headphones and watched as Kevin dash out of the stage, the crowd with laughter amongst them. Immediately, Matron took his belongings and quickly went down the auditorium and chased after Kevin.<br />
<br />
He went and looked to the left and right and saw no one, he wondered where had Kevin went, the corridor having nothing except maybe a toilet at the end of the hallway and a few stair cases up and down.<br />
<br />
He reached for his cell phone and dialled for his  Friend, only thing that came out from his cell phones were beeps. As time goes by the minute, he kept on dialling and there being no response. Suddenly, he had forgotten why and who he was calling for, he looked down and noticed it was Dr Percival Chang&#39;s number, briefly noting that he didn&#39;t know the teacher before suddenly recalling being his favourite student, the teacher&#39;s pet as his classmates described him to be. He simply noted that he just wanted to call him for clarification on...something, as the final ring took hold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Dr Percival Chang speaking, may I know who is this?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Matron Ritter, module rep for class of--?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh Matron! My most well-mannered student, do---Oh there you are!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr Percival Chang stood straight from where he was standing, he was walking in the opposite direction of Matron and just so happens to be where he is at now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was just remarking about how some students...are behaving quite unruly today. Nothing&#39;s worse than a bunch of rowdy men...except maybe boys who play around with other boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matron took note of that remark, and looked to his side briefly. Recalling how conservative and strict the Asian-British foreign teacher was, but the teachings he provided were the best, plus he was hot for a middle aged dad, so it should be fine for now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go to the office lounge shall we? And far away from this rowdy place....I&#39;m so Glad at the very least I have one respectful students like you Matron.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, thank you Dr Percival Chang.&quot; He spoke, blushing at the remark despite it being quite odd and awkward. It was just a way of interaction which was rather cute. Oh if only he was more open minded.<br />
<br />
As they walked, Matron&#39;s lower parts stiffen to the transformation point with reality shifts and mental change occurring Matron simply felt a jolt down there as he shrugged it off and continued to walk and listen to another one of the Dr&#39;s talks.<br />
<br />
His clothes seem to take advantage over this. Wanting to impress the doctor no matter what as maturity takes root. Clothes becoming tighter as he felt the urge the straighten up his posture while talking to Dr Chang.<br />
<br />
Hoodie melting down into his free right arm as it wrapped around his backpack, slithering to his right hand as it became a dark brown briefcase which consisted of more office related things and papers. <br />
<br />
His shoes made a familiar CLUNK sound as he glanced down momentarily to see a pair of loafers fit over his seemingly more tannish complexion. He noticed more bristles and strands of hair to poke out from the more muscular legs that he had possessed.<br />
<br />
He noticed his arms and hands taking on a similar complexion as his continued to walk with the doctor. Developing a darker Tan by the minute with numerous bristles sprouting all over. <br />
<br />
His body lost its fat as it developed lean well-maintained muscle that made him feel great, he cracked his neck, as he allowed the racial transfiguration of his body.<br />
<br />
He placed his fists in his pockets, leisurely enjoying the walk. Pants now fancying into formal dress pants , tightening all over with a similar sensation around his waist as steel buns dominated at the back of his hips. <br />
<br />
It feels good! He thought, suddenly feeling like he&#39;s the man in charge around here. He walked with exude confidence, as though he&#39;d still got that suaveness that attracted---PUMP! Goes the testosterone from below, making him smirk as though he&#39;s enjoying every moment.<br />
<br />
His sleeves lengthened out, covering his nicer and more attractive looking foreign arms with a row of buttons down the middle. Numerous stripes design themselves on the middle aged man dress shirt he wore. He always appreciated the mature looks Teachers presented themselves, really professional.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Say Matron, you don&#39;t mind that we continued to discuss about Advanced Biochemistry inside the lounge...do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh...uh no! Not at all!&quot; <br />
<br />
Matron felt shocked and a bit confused, since when did he even learn about ADVANCED Biochem , he barely even passed the module! But as Percival ran through notes and knowledge worth a life time, Matron felt confident in the subject. In fact, he even recalled studying it with Percival! Smiling to himself, feeling a strong bond between the two , though his dick didn&#39;t react surprising enough.<br />
<br />
Matron&#39;s earphones draped down as they slithered down his neck into a identification card, completely oblivious to it as the string gets attached to a new identification card, which showed a picture of his inevitable fate. Not that he even noticed as he scanned his card and allowed both Percival and himself into the lounge.<br />
<br />
As the both of them are in, almost instantaneously, Matron grabbed a beer can from the fridge. Just being legal age and suddenly enjoying its pleasures. <br />
<br />
&quot;Beer as always Matron?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah! I like beer!&quot; <br />
<br />
His voice sounding enthusiastic, sure he kinda enjoyed the taste before. But for some reason even more so as his tastes get refined , and the daringness to even take one of teacher&#39;s stash. <br />
<br />
No worries! I can always take my buddy out for drinking later!<br />
<br />
&quot; So let&#39;s begin! &quot;<br />
&quot; Sure!&quot;<br />
<br />
Originally, Matron was slightly bored of the extremely scientific details. Chugging on a beer can to stay awake and reaching out for more cans on the mini fridge while he&#39;s at it. Developing an obsession , but suddenly seemingly more relaxed and interested in the topic Percival is speaking. As he slides some cans over to the fellow Asian male, and responded back.<br />
<br />
Stutters in his voice get extinguished as he felt his body relax as they continued the conversation about lessons and science. Heart feeling at ease. No wonder he was Dr Chang&#39;s Favourite, he laughed honestly as he brushed against his hair, shaving them into a men&#39;s cut with little bristles on the top and sides with little greys on them. <br />
<br />
The two continued the interesting debate over science, chugging on cans as Percival seemed to fall in a daze like state before him, despite knowingly having more alcohol tolerance than the Doctor-ah screw the formalities, he&#39;s a Doctor himself anyways!<br />
<br />
He has definitely taken the same subjects as Percival when he was in his university. More manly and matured features take over his facial expressions and age. Remembering meeting the man when....when...<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you gay?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well...No.&quot; He felt shocked, not at the homophobic nature of his Friend but rather, it was something personal. His eyes stared into the abyss, as he fiddled with something on his left ring finger. Feeling the shape and hard but rich texture it had, twisting and turning as though he&#39;s adjusting to his fellow doctorate buddy&#39;s conservative personality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you gay?<br />
&quot;No...&quot; He felt different . His mind tried to search for that...guy he liked? Guy he liked? Kev--Percival? He&#39;s just a buddy right? And plus he&#39;s straight! And he only hangs out with straight guys that share with his beliefs. So if he&#39;s talking with you very openly...you must be straight and homophobic.<br />
<br />
Sadness turned into confusion, being more open to the fellow men&#39;s words as he recalled being the man who helped get Percival out of his shell and allowing him to find a Girlfriend back at home. Likewise, he also found the love of his life, a very traditional , foreign woman. He smiled as he recalled all his affection and love for her and their kids, before a drunk question comes along and ruins everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you gay?&quot;<br />
&quot;No way man! I&#39;m straight! You of all people should know that Percival! Don&#39;t ask me such a queer question!&quot; His voice became heavily accented, like those of a mixed race, Indian-Caribbean . Confusion turned into disgust as his genes boiled ferociously like the straight family Asian man he is. &quot;I mean! I even got married and you were there! I&#39;m definitely not a fag!&quot; <br />
<br />
He took a huge chug of the beer can, crushed it with a CRUNCH! Like it was though he was embracing his new powerful Self, impatiently crushing away every last bit of homosexuality that he used to be tossed it aside. He wanted nothing to do with it, he was never a fag! He was straight! <br />
<br />
&quot;IM STRAIGHT!&quot; And as though he proclaimed it, the heavy burden left over his shoulders as new sensations with being with his Wife took over. He smiled momentarily, before suddenly being overwhelmed with new memories as he clutched his head once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha! What to do? My Son is gay ! Where&#39;s the Honour in that?&quot; He spoke in a tired voice , eyes momentarily rising as though conflicting memories are mixed about his brain. One of a teenager never being able to complete his arousal while the other contains a family man whose always so overly lenient with his Wife and sons. <br />
<br />
Dr Percival Chang shook his head, took another sip of his beer can, and softly spoke to his colleague, speaking out the generic Asian parent heritage tradition phrases. Gently patting his friend&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re always such a push-over Mark! That&#39;s not good--Hic!&quot;<br />
&quot;Haha yeah...Mark, that&#39;s my name--Hic!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark Ritter closed his eyes and began to hug the other male, vision and reality so drunkenly twisted until he thinks that he&#39;s hugging his Wife. Sure Mark would occasionally seek comfort from his buddy and fellow teacher for advice, but never to the point he would be--<br />
<br />
Dr Percival Chang felt momentarily disgust at the touches before he became as drunken as the guy embracing him, seeing a vision of his Wife embracing his chest like the good woman she is. <br />
<br />
Both allowing their drunk heterosexual fantasies get the better of them as they smiled lovingly at one another, thinking the other was their respective wives.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must show the world that the Asian tradition is absolute Dr Riches...wherever you are hahahaha. Get your own room!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahahaha! Percival ! You queer! I just wanna, kiss my beautiful Wife that&#39;s in front of me hahahaha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr Mark Riches laughed and slumped over his best man, with Dr Percival Chang lying on the couch letting Mark over him. Overly drunk men thinking the other was their female significant other back in their respective homes, as they gave in to the drunken haze.</p>
