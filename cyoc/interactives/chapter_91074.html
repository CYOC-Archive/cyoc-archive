<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie looked at at Grace, &quot;You know if Kellie sees you become younger see might bound with you faster. It might make the bound between the two of you stronger if you have something like that in common.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace smiled and nodded. &quot;Okay it&#39;s settled let&#39;s age back to 29 and when I give you the signal make me seven.&quot; <br />
<br />
Katie smiled and wished the two teens to be 29 again. The familiar tingling spread over the two girls as they began to slowly age into adulthood. Katie regained the curves of her twenties as she matured. Her breasts and hips expanded as she lost the slim features of an 18 year old girl. Looking over herself Katie was once again a 29 year old woman with a mature face, full breasts and womanly curves.<br />
<br />
Grace&#39;s progression proceeded similar to Katie&#39;s. The 16 year old teen grew a couple of inches as she raced towards her twenties. As she became twenty her womanly curves returned. Grace was a sultry looking woman in her twenties with large d cup breasts and a curvy but trim waist. Grace looked herself over in the hallway mirror. The cute teen was now replaced by a beautiful dark haired woman with sultry green eyes and luxurious black hair that flowed to the middle of her back. &quot;I forgot how good I looked at this age,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;Whenever I went out with my late husband I always turnd heads. I shouldn&#39;t get too used to this though, Kellie will be home in a few minutes.&quot; Katie looked over at her new friend. &quot;You know when this is over I can make you 29 permenantly,&quot; she said. Grace smiled. &quot;Maybe,&quot; she said. &quot;But I&#39;ve lived a full life I don&#39;t know if I want to grow up all over again. Still.....maybe.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two women were talking when they heard the door open. Turning towards the front door Grace and Katie saw a sullen looking girl enter the house. Kellie sighed as she kicked off her sneakers and made her way towards the couch. Sitting down Kellie stared down at her stocking covered feet that dangled a few inches off the floor. &quot;How was school?&quot; Katie asked cautiously. &quot;Terrible mom...i mean Katie, darn it,&quot; Kellie said sadly. &quot;The teacher got mad because I tried to show her that her answer was wrong. Plus your friends were sick and some mean girls picked on me. I ate lunch by myself and none of the other kids wanted to talk to me. I forgot how mean kids can be, I don&#39;t think I can do that again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie looked at her mom. The adult Kellie was still having a hard time adjusting to life as a child, hopefully Grace would help cheer her up but first she would change it so Kellie would be able to call Katie Katie again. Silently Katie made a wish so her mom wouldn&#39;t call Katie mom anymore. &quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear you had a tough day Kellie,&quot; she said. &quot;Hopefully things will be better soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie looked up at Katie and smiled. &quot;Thanks Katie,&quot; she said sadly before pausing. &quot;Hey I&#39;m not calling you mom anymore. Maybe things are starting to turn back to normal.&quot; Kellie smiled as she looked at Katie and Grace. &quot;Katie whose this,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Grace stepped forward and smiled. She had been waiting for this and had already thought of a story. &quot;Wow I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t recognize me,&quot; Grace said. &quot;It&#39;s me Grace, your neighbor. I don&#39;t know what happened but I stopped over earlier today to check on you two and the next thing I knew I looked like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie&#39;s jaw went slack. &quot;Grace,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Oh no your getting younger too. Katie how is this happening, maybe we should call a doctor or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace smiled and approached the young girl. &quot;There&#39;s no need for that,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m perfectly happy like this. I like being young maybe theirs a reason I&#39;m like this,. Maybe I can help you embrace your situation.&quot; Grace turned towards Katie and smiled. Katie knew this was the signal and wished Grace to become seven.<br />
<br />
Kellie looked at her formerly elderly neighbor with a look of disbelief. That someone would want to become so much younger mystified her. As Kellie looked at Grace she noticed something seemed different about Grace. &quot;Grace,&quot; Kellie whispered. &quot;Your.....your still getting younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Grace said in mock surprise. &quot;I need to see,&quot; the now college age Grace made her way towards the hallway mirror and examined herself. &quot;Wow I guess I am,&quot; the 21 year old remarked. &quot;I wonder how young I&#39;m going to be. Maybe I can be your babysitter or even your new friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie stared in horror as her former neighbor began regressing through her teens. A now 16 year old Grace was still happily looking at herself in the mirror. &quot;How can you be so calm?&quot; Kellie asked. &quot;I mean look at you. Your barely old enough to be in high school now. If you get any younger your going to be a child again just like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace turned to Kellie and smiled as she shrank down becoming a skinny girl of 13. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve been this young,&quot; Grace said in a bubbly teen voice. &quot;I don&#39;t know how long this will last so I want to savor every minute.&quot; Grace turned back towards the mirror as she became a preteen of 12. &quot;Guess I won&#39;t be babysitting,&quot; she said cheerfully. &quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind having a friend over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie stared in shock as Grace continued to regress. It boggled her mind that Grace seemed so comfortable with becoming a child. Kellie watched as Grace went from 12, to 11, to 10. The young girl smiled happily as her clothes became far to large for her tiny frame. Grace kicked away her shoes and pants giggling happily as she became younger and younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grace,&quot; Kellie whispered in shock. &quot;Do you.....do you feel okay? I mean your getting so young, when it happened to me I was absolutely terrified.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nine year old Grace turned to Kellie and smiled. &quot;We need to accept things as they happen,&quot; she said cheerfully. &quot;Everything happens for a reason why worry ourselves about what we can&#39;t control. We should just embrace it, things will turn out for the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie watched as Grace continued to grow younger becoming eight and finally seven. The young first grader smiled happily as she spun around in her overly large shirt, which covered her to her shins. Grace smiled and approached the seven year old Kellie. &quot;Come on Kellie,&quot; she said cheerfully. &quot;Who knows how long this will last let&#39;s go play and enjoy our second childhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cautiously Kellie grasped Graces outstretched hand. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said shyly. Grace gave Kellie a reassuring hug. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she said. &quot;You&#39;ll see Kellie. Everything will be just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie watched as the two seven year olds ran upstairs to play. Hopefully Kellie would now embrace her new found youth before becoming an adult again. Still watching the young girls play and laugh made Katie want to join them just a little. Katie now thought about her next move. Let the two enjoy their time together or join them as first graders. She pondered her choices now as she stood in the living room listening to the sounds of children laughing.</p>
