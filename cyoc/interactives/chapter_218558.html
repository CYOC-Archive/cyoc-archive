<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come one! Push it! Just a bit harder! Only a few more reps! One More!&quot; Adrian cheered on his client. It was tough. He&#39;d been working with Matt for about three months now and the guy wasn&#39;t showing as much progress as either of them wanted. The big guy had just finished a hard set and was breathing heavily. Sweat dripped down his shirt, covering it completely. Adrian gave it a slap. &quot;Good job man. We&#39;ve just gotta keep at it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh...&quot; Matt breathed heavily as he tried to keep his composure. Supposedly he was a bit of a big shot in the world. Not that Adrian understood any of it. Any time Matt would start talking about work, Adrian would zone out. Something about computers and soft ware. He didn&#39;t understand much other than being able to take a picture then post it online. &quot;Again?&quot; Matt asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wait a little longer,&quot; Adrian said. &quot;I don&#39;t want you passing out on me. Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt nodded. His whole body seemed to go right along with it. &quot;Right. That would suck...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. Don&#39;t need you on the ground,&quot; Adrian smiled. Matt also smiled at the jab. He knew his body was a bit more than hefty. A large amount of fat covered every inch of him. &quot;So,&quot; Adrian changed the subject back, &quot;how&#39;s your diet been?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good?&quot; Matt said. &quot;I&#39;ve been eating everything you&#39;ve been telling me to. I&#39;ve been staying away from any processed foods and eating chicken and rice at least 3 times a week. Haven&#39;t even had a brownie in the past month.&quot; But his large belly and heavy shoulders told a different story. Same with his hips as thick mounds of fat layered over his legs and butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Adrian eyed him suspiciously, but Matt seemed to be pretty earnest about it. &quot;Okay. Then I guess you&#39;re just really bad at losing weight and we need to stay at it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good...&quot; Matt breathed. &quot;Then let&#39;s get going.&quot; <br />
<br />
The big guy pushed through the rest of the workout without any complaints. Even though his body was covered in sweat and he was clearly ready to just drop onto a bed and pass out, he didn&#39;t say anything about quitting. It was one of the main reasons Adrian never found Matt to be annoying to train. While others would complain about the weight, intensity or progress, Matt kept a chipper attitude the entire way through. Adrian was the one who had to tell him to pull it back the intensity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...&quot; Matt breathed as he was about to go to the locker room and change. &quot;You wanna help me with something tomorrow?&quot; <br />
<br />
Adrian&#39;s brow furrowed. &quot;Help? With what?&quot; he was nervous about Matt asking to move furniture or something. Even if Adrian was a big dude and it would barely be an inconvenience in terms of weight, he still didn&#39;t want to spend his days off moving a bunch of shit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Work actually,&quot; Matt said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know if I can help much with that,&quot; Adrian answered. &quot;Not exactly all that good with computers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s the thing; you don&#39;t have to be,&quot; Matt smiled. &quot;It&#39;s a whole new thing. Still not even in beta but it could be absolutely massive. We just need a couple of outside testers to see if it&#39;ll work or if it&#39;s really compatible.&quot; Adrian hesitated. &quot;Look, it&#39;s a thousand bucks either way. All you have to do is come down, download the app and then try it a couple of times. If you don&#39;t like it, just delete it. Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian&#39;s mouth was still hanging open from the thousand dollar price tag. &quot;Yeah man! Absolutely!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; Matt smiled. He wrote down an address and time and handed it to Adrian. &quot;Just meet here tomorrow and ask for me. Then we&#39;ll get you all squared away.&quot;<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Adrian drove through the city until he found the address listed. &quot;Damn...&quot; he muttered as he stared at the 30 story glass building in front of him. he didn&#39;t know how many floors Matt&#39;s office would have, but just based off the architecture and statues out front, even half a floor would cost a fortune. Adrian pulled into the parking garage. <br />
<br />
He walked around front to the security desk. Only to be shocked again as the two men working behind the counter were absolutely built. Each one looked squeezed into the security uniform and were having a bit of a struggle to sit still. One looked to be actively squeezing a grip train while the other looked like he wanted to run around the building. &quot;Hey,&quot; Adrian said. Even with his athletic size, he couldn&#39;t help but feel the least bit intimidated by the two men. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; one of the guards asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Yeah,&quot; Adrian continued. &quot;I&#39;m looking for Matt Perkins.&quot; <br />
<br />
Before he was able to radio, Matt came barreling through. &quot;Right on time!&quot; Matt smiled. He was out of breath and a bit of sweat rolled down the side of his rounded face, but his smile shined through. &quot;Sorry. He&#39;s with me.&quot; Matt said as he clutched his sides. The guards nodded and opened the gate.  Adrian almost thought he heard one scoff as he walked by. &quot;Sorry about that... And this,&quot; he motioned to himself. &quot;Just wanted to meet you down here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a problem,&quot; Adrian said. His eyes couldn&#39;t stay forward as he looked around the halls. The entire office was teeming with life with some of the most attractive people he&#39;d ever seen. Even though he&#39;d lived in this city for years, he couldn&#39;t remember seeing a single person as attractive as the people he passed. &quot;But what&#39;s the app?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt waited for the elevator to open and close before speaking. &quot;It&#39;s a desire transmitter,&quot; he smiled wildly. &quot;We&#39;ve been testing it a little bit in the office, but it&#39;s supposed to be able to transmit words into reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian felt lost already. He nodded as Matt continued speaking. Even if he wasn&#39;t listening, the sheer excitement coming off the other man filled him with some as well. The elevator dinged and Matt was rushing off again. Adrian would have been surprised at just how much energy the round man had if he wasn&#39;t his personal trainer. Even he was having a bit of difficulty keeping up without feeling like he needed to change his pace into a jog.<br />
<br />
&quot;This way,&quot; Matt pointed down the hall. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Perkins?&quot; a high class looking secretary with glasses rounded the corner. Her raven black hair fell over her shoulder perfectly. The tight dress she wore accentuated every single one of her curves. And the bright red lipstick made her lips look all the more voluptuous. Matt didn&#39;t slow. When he saw that Adrian did, he grabbed the man by the wrist and kept pulling. The woman started off behind them, somehow able to keep up in her high heels. &quot;Mr. Donahue would like to speak with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell him I&#39;m with a client,&quot; Matt said. He didn&#39;t slow in the slightest and just kept heading for his office. Once there, he pulled Adrian in and closed the door, then the blinds. &quot;Now...&quot; he was having trouble breathing as his body weight leaned against the door. &quot;Let&#39;s... Get... You... Started...&quot; <br />
<br />
Matt took his seat behind the desk and took a drink of water. &#39;At least he&#39;s not lying about that,&#39; Adrian stared. Even looking at the breakfast in the trash, it was just a banana and granola bar. Nothing that would be too high in fat. And then there was a lunch box in the corner as well. That meant he probably wasn&#39;t eating out either. <br />
<br />
Adrian scolded himself for being nosy, only to realize what kind of office he was in. They were on the top floor looking over the city. Not only that but this was a huge corner office. Easily larger than his living room, and decked out with several leather chairs and desk that probably was worth more than his yearly pay. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh-hm,&quot; Matt cleared his throat, drawing Adrian&#39;s attention back to the computer. &quot;All I need is your full name and phone number and it&#39;ll send you the app. Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian gave it to him and then felt a notification on his phone. &quot;Woah... That was fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. Now download it,&quot; Matt ordered. His eyes kept darting back at the front door. Adrian did as he was told. He opened the app to find a relatively plain looking screen. Besides a few grey bars, menu and help button, and flashing I bar there wasn&#39;t anything on the screen. &quot;Put your name in.&quot; Again, Adrian did as he was told. Only this time he saw a whole host of stats appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Adrian gasped as it knew everything about him, including his exact weight, height, body fat percentage and more. However, he felt awkward when he scrolled down to see his dick size. It was a full inch smaller than he bragged about. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that. Just change one thing,&quot; Matt said. Adrian&#39;s fingers hung over the different stats. Matt fidgeted in his chair. &quot;Just change one thing. Anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian wasn&#39;t sure and he clicked on body fat percentage. He&#39;d always kept it pretty low, mostly hanging around the 13-15% range. Getting any lower would be pretty hard to maintain and he&#39;d always be hungry. He dropped it down to 9%. &quot;Wo-ah...&quot; he gasped. Suddenly, his body shifted and changed as he felt about fifteen pounds of his fat turn into muscle. It started in his waist. The little bit of belly fat that he had quickly tightened and toned into a perfect six pack. Then that weight shifted out to the rest of him. His pecs and shoulders pushed harder against his shirt. His biceps filled the sleeves completely, making them roll up towards his shoulders. He felt the little room he still had between his legs completely disappear as his quads fought over the space.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-at... What the hell?&quot; Adrian panted as he held onto the desk for a little bit of support. His stomach grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect,&quot; Matt smiled as he pulled out his lunch and handed Adrian an apple. <br />
<br />
Adrian had so many questions. What had just happened.? Why did Matt want him to change something so badly? Why was he so damn hungry?<br />
<br />
But none of them could be answered as Matt&#39;s office door slammed open. &quot;Mr. Perkins,&quot; a massively built man that would have put even the guards out front to shame stood in the doorway. His 6&#39;9&quot; body was stuffed into a button up dress shirt and some black pants. The top buttons couldn&#39;t close around his neck, but the rest of the shirt and pants had to have been specially tailored made to him as there was no way he could find something that large over the counter. He must have lived and breathed the gym. Though, with how much Matt had been working out, Adrian figured he should have looked closer to what this man was than his current rotund shape. &quot;I believe I said I needed to talk to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course sir,&quot; Matt nearly whimpered. &quot;But you always said that customers come first.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man&#39;s masculine face twitched. &quot;Of course,&quot; he seethed. &quot;Is this the customer?&quot; His face softened into a smile, though the level of agitation on it didn&#39;t change much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Matt said. &quot;I have him all set up for testing. I was just going to--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need,&quot; the man said. &quot;He&#39;ll figure it out on his own. Send him home and come to my office the moment he&#39;s gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Matt said. &quot;Come along,&quot; Matt led Adrian to the elevator and out to the garage.</p>
