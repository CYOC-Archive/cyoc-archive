<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The doors open and a humongous Chris walks in. He was 8&#39;10&quot; tall, and weighed about 1500 pounds. His muscles were so huge that his arms could barely touch his sides. His belly was swollen and round, the cum of two gigantic muscle freaks sloshing around inside him. He was horny, and looking for some dick.<br />
&quot;DOM, JEFF!&quot; he roared, his voice loud and deep.<br />
&quot;C-Chris?&quot; Dominic gasped. The muscular giant was a monster, far, far larger than either him or Jeff. And yet, there was still a sense of familiarity. Jeff&#39;s cock, which had been growing slowly ever since he&#39;d stepped into the gym, throbbed in a massive, hairy paw. He groaned as his dick was worked over, and felt himself swell further, the muscle worshippers stepping back as they tried to accommodate his growing body.<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s me!&quot; the enormous, muscular god replied. &quot;I&#39;m here to join you guys in your fun. Wanna get fucked again!&quot; He turned around and shook his huge ass at the muscle gods, grinning as he felt his cock pulse and drip pre onto the floor, the clear fluid sizzling as it made contact with the concrete.<br />
&quot;Fuuuck...&quot; Jeff groaned, his hands reaching out to grope at his little brother&#39;s enormous, hairy asscheeks. &quot;You are fucking huge!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know!&quot; Chris grinned. &quot;But I want you to be even bigger, bro. Bigger than anyone in the universe!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Jeff said, his dick twitching at the thought of being the biggest.<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot; Dominic asked.<br />
&quot;Nothing much, just increased the growth rate for all of us,&quot; Chris said. &quot;That&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?! But that means we&#39;ll-&quot; Dominic protested.<br />
&quot;Grow and grow and grow,&quot; Jeff cut him off. &quot;Until we&#39;re the biggest muscle monsters that ever existed!&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; Chris agreed.<br />
&quot;Now, how about we get back to what we were doing before,&quot; Chris suggested, grinning.<br />
Jeff nodded. He and his brothers moved back into the center of the gym, surrounded by the smaller muscle worshippers. Jeff pulled Chris&#39; monstrous ass cheeks apart and spat on his hole. Then, holding his huge cock in his hand, he guided it to Chris&#39; gaping entrance. Chris grunted as the huge, veiny dick penetrated him, and soon Jeff was thrusting back and forth, fucking him hard. Dominic was kneeling in front of Chris, feeding his own monstrous cock to his friend.<br />
Chris eagerly sucked Dominic&#39;s cock, loving the taste of the man-flesh. He could feel the heat radiating off the massive, pulsing meat-stick, and the sensation was incredible. His own cock was hard as a rock, and dripping pre-cum everywhere.<br />
Jeff and Dominic moaned loudly, the vibrations sending delicious tremors through Chris&#39; body. Jeff could feel the cum churning in his balls, and knew he was close to coming. Dominic&#39;s cock was pulsing with need, and the wrestler&#39;s balls were swollen and heavy.<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Chris yelled, as Jeff&#39;s monstrous cock rammed into his prostate, sending waves of pleasure coursing through his body. Dominic&#39;s dick swelled even bigger, and his balls clenched as he neared his climax.<br />
&quot;Fuck yes!&quot; Chris moaned, as his own orgasm hit him. His cock pulsed and spurted huge ropes of cum, the thick, white fluid coating his face and chest. Dominic and Jeff followed suit, their own orgasms overwhelming them.<br />
&quot;Ahhhhhh!&quot; Jeff cried, as his cock throbbed and shot its load deep inside his brother&#39;s ass. Dominic&#39;s cock erupted, flooding Chris&#39; mouth with cum. The three men moaned in ecstasy, their bodies writhing in pleasure.<br />
As the orgasms subsided, the three men collapsed, exhausted and spent. They lay there, panting, their muscles still quivering. Chris could feel the cum in his belly churning, and he could sense the changes beginning. He knew that the cum was changing him, making him bigger, stronger, and more muscular. He also knew that it wouldn&#39;t be long before the effects became visible.<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; Jeff panted, his mind hazy and his body tingling. &quot;That was incredible.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Dominic agreed, his breath ragged. &quot;I&#39;ve never come that hard before.&quot;<br />
The three men lay there, basking in the afterglow, their bodies glistening with sweat. The crowd of muscle worshippers was gathered around them, their own cocks hard and their own bodies slick with arousal.<br />
Suddenly, Chris&#39; abs started to swell, growing larger and cobbler by the second. His muscles were becoming more defined, his chest broadening, his arms thickening. He could feel his body growing, stretching, and expanding. He was getting bigger, stronger, and more powerful.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?!&quot; Jeff gasped, his own body starting to change. His muscles were bulging, his pecs growing, his biceps swelling. He was becoming a monster, a hulking behemoth of a man.<br />
Dominic was undergoing the same transformation, his body expanding, his muscles growing, his cock swelling. He was becoming a god, a colossus among men.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re growing!&quot; Chris yelled, his voice deep and resonant. &quot;We&#39;re becoming bigger, stronger, and more powerful! We&#39;re becoming the biggest, strongest, and most powerful muscle monsters that have ever existed!&quot;<br />
The crowd of muscle worshippers was cheering, their cocks throbbing, their bodies trembling with excitement. They were witnessing the birth of the ultimate muscle gods, the three men who would rule the world with their strength and size.</p>
