<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you browse through the catalog - looking at the variety of objects you can be turned into - you start to feel a bit lightheaded. The surreal nature of this whole thing is beginning to get to you. Are you really - are you really going to go through with this? Because the implications of this - it&#39;s pretty staggering. You&#39;d be turned into an object. A thing! You trusted Jade - she was your best friend - but the thought of her being able to do whatever she wanted, with no input from you...<br />
<br />
It was scary!<br />
<br />
But also...kind of a turn on? Like...a pretty big one in fact. And you weren&#39;t quite sure how Jade might react to that - if you told her at all. It was kind of embarrassing to realize that you wanted to be used by your best friend. <br />
<br />
You closed your eyes, shaking your head a bit to try and clear your head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there. You alright?&quot; <br />
<br />
You open your eyes to see Ashley standing nearby, looking down at you with a kind expression. She hands you a cup of coffee, which you accept gratefully. &quot;Oh...thanks,&quot; you tell her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem. I saw you looking kind of pale in here, and I just wanted to have a quick talk with you, put your mind at ease if I can. I get it - this is a lot to take in, yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod vigorously. <br />
<br />
Ashley smiled. &quot;I get that. You know, before I worked here...I went through with a couple transformations myself. With a friend - I didn&#39;t feel comfortable being sold, though I don&#39;t judge the ones who are. I&#39;ve seen all sorts of people, wanting to be all sorts of things, in all sorts of circumstances.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I get that - I called a friend of mine...she&#39;s going to be meeting me here. I couldn&#39;t - I wouldn&#39;t feel right about being sold to someone I don&#39;t know.&quot; You laugh, shaking your head when you realize what you&#39;ve just said. &quot;What a weird sentence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley laughed. &quot;Yeah, it is at that. But yeah. I went through with it. Emily was my best friend...I became her purse for the weekend. And then her shirt the weekend after that.&quot; She lets out a wistful sigh. &quot;It was...it&#39;s hard to describe the sensation until you&#39;ve gone through it yourself, to be honest with you. I felt...secure. Safe. Loved. It was...intimate in a way I&#39;d never really experienced before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; you whisper. &quot;And...are you still friends with Emily?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley smiled. &quot;A bit more than that now, actually.&quot; She looked around and then whispered, &quot;I&#39;m wearing her right now,&quot; she added.<br />
<br />
Your eyes went wide. &quot;Wh..what? Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhmm,&quot; Ashley said, looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s...your shirt...?&quot; you asked, looking at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...&quot; Ashley blushed. &quot;No. Under that. She&#39;s guarding the girls, you could say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Oh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley laughed again. &quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And...and she&#39;s...she&#39;s okay with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley smirks, and then looks around before grabbing at her breasts for a moment, giving them a squeeze. &quot;Yeah, she&#39;s probably on cloud nine right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.....Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley smiled. &quot;You can choose the sensitivity of how the change feels. So - yeah - she&#39;s good.&quot;<br />
<br />
You could feel the blush spreading across your face, and you looked away, tucking your hair behind your ear. &quot;I...see...&quot; you ventured cautiously. &quot;That&#39;s...good to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley smiled. &quot;I gotta get back to the desk. I just wanted to let you know - it&#39;s cool to be nervous. Just don&#39;t stress too much. If you trust your friend, it could be a truly wonderful experience. Okay? If you have any questions, feel free to ask me about them. And if you decide not to do it, no judgements. I&#39;ll direct your friend in here when she arrives.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod and watch Ashley leave, returning your focus to the catalog. <br />
<br />
So many options. Everything from statues, mannequins, dolls of all sorts, to furniture like chairs, couches, even TV&#39;s. What would it even feel like to be half of those objects? To be aware, but completely helpless? You shivered a bit, and blushed again at the thought - you&#39;d always been a little curious to try bondage - the idea of being tightly restrained by someone else was a definite turn on, though there hadn&#39;t really been anyone you trusted enough to try it yet. <br />
<br />
You browse the catalog for a bit until you hear a familiar voice out in the lobby. Jade.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you must be the friend,&quot; you hear Ashley say. &quot;Your friend Megan is waiting for you in the other room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks!&quot; Jade says. A moment later, she comes through the door, giving you a curious nod. &quot;So. This definitely isn&#39;t a toys-r-us.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile at your friend. Jade&#39;s been one of your best friends for years now. You&#39;d been through a lot together. You&#39;d been there when Jade&#39;s parents had gotten a divorce. She&#39;d been there for you when your brother had gotten into a car accident and ended up in a coma for a week. You&#39;d dealt with bullies, home problems, the usual drama that came along with being a teenage girl, and you&#39;d always stuck by each other. Her shoulder-length black hair was adorned with a small butterfly ornament, and there were a few streaks of green visible. She wore a halter top with a mesh overlay, as well as a skirt with fishnet leggings. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sadly, it is not,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll recover eventually. Thanks for coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, sure,&quot; Jade says with a shrug. She glances around the room curiously. &quot;So, what is this place? Some kind of curio shop? Seems a little too high tech for something like that, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; you say. &quot;Not exactly...they sell a lot of stuff, yeah, but...that stuff...is people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade looks down at you for a moment, eyebrows slightly raised. &quot;Ohhhhkay,&quot; she finally says. &quot;Are you high?&quot;<br />
<br />
You let out a laugh. &quot;No. No, I&#39;m not high. No. Look - this place - it can turn people into objects. See this catalog here?&quot; You move it so that Jade can take a look, and she looks down at it, frowning deeper now. &quot;People can turn themselves into things - for a set amount of time, and either be sold to strangers or entrusted to a friend...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade looks at the catalog, and then back at you. &quot;Uh, alright Megan, you&#39;re starting to scare me a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No - look - I&#39;m not doing a good job at explaining this --&quot;<br />
<br />
Someone cleared their throat and you and Jade turned to see Ashley standing there, holding up her hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to be listening in,&quot; she said apologetically. &quot;But if you would please come with me, I think I can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade shoots you a curious glance - you shrug, you have no idea what Ashley has in mind - and then the two of you followed Ashley into a back room with the label of PROCESSING. That sounds...somewhat ominous, you think. But when you enter the room, your eyes widen. There&#39;s a statue of a man and woman hugging - the same ones you&#39;d seen in the shop earlier! The detail on the statue was incredible - down to the individual strands of hair. And yet, when you reached out a hesitant hand to touch it - it was hard and a bit rough. The two figures were looking deeply at each other - you can practically feel their love emanating from the sculpture. In a weird way, it makes you feel a bit jealous. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; you whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; Jade admitted. &quot;It&#39;s...a nice looking statue, I guess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jade - this isn&#39;t just - it&#39;s not just a statue. I saw these two - they were in the store before me. And...they were talking about becoming statues for a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade frowns, looking at the sculpture, eyebrows furrowed. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true. They&#39;ll be an excellent display piece on loan to the museum for the week. They came out wonderfully, don&#39;t you think? But come with me - perhaps a more direct example is in store. We&#39;ve also gotten some of our returns,&quot; Ashley said. &quot;Over here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ashley leads you over to a wooden crate. She takes a moment to pry it open, revealing a male plastic mannequin, wearing some trendy looking sporting gear and wielding a tennis racket. Like the statue of the pair, it looked incredibly realistic. You both watch as Ashley takes out a small device and puts it on the side of the mannequin; she keys in a few buttons, and then steps back.<br />
<br />
At first, nothing seems to be happening. You can feel Jade looking over at you with a <i>have you completely lost your fucking mind</i> expression on her face. But then, you gasp, and the plastic seems to be moving - changing - almost seeming like it&#39;s melting right off the man. Jade&#39;s mouth opens and she backs up in shock, watching in disbelief as plastic becomes skin. A moment later, the man lowers his arm and drops the tennis racket. He blinks - slowly at first - and then cracks his head to the side, before smiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that feels good!&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back Mr. Blake,&quot; Ashley says warmly. &quot;Hope you had a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I did, I did.&quot; He nods to you and Jade. &quot;Hey there girls. Don&#39;t mind me.&quot; He begins to stretch. &quot;A month on the floor really puts a crick in the &#39;ol neck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...A month on the floor?&quot; Jade repeats faintly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh - yeah. Sporting goods store! Andy&#39;s Sporting Goods. I was one of the main displays, right in the center. Great place, lots of deals - you should check them out, cause a sale is coming up! Fifty percent off of...oh. Ahem. Ah - sorry. Spent so much time listening to sales people that it&#39;s almost instinct now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley laughs. &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a minute Mr. Blake. Go ahead and keep stretching and I&#39;ll be right back, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, sure. Thanks Ash. See you around girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley smiles and leads the two of you back to the waiting area. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hope that helped,&quot; Ashley says, winking at you over Jade&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Jade takes a seat next to you, her eyes wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;That...really just happened,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; you say, popping your mouth on the P.<br />
<br />
Jade let out a small laugh. &quot;Alright. Well. Gonna have to reconfigure a lot of what I thought was possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile at her. &quot;Take your time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely not a toys-r-us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True. Though I guess you could make me into something that WOULD be in a toys-r-us...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade turns to you with a laugh. &quot;Yeah, sure, I&#39;ll just go ahead and...wait. Wait - wait. Let me get this straight. You - you want to do this, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You bite your lip and nod your head. <br />
<br />
Jade laughs. &quot;Holy shit. Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm...yeah...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade runs a hand through her hair. &quot;Well. I wasn&#39;t sure what I expected when I got that call - but it certainly wasn&#39;t this!&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug self-consciously. &quot;I mean...I wasn&#39;t expecting to find a place like this either. But...what do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really want to do this?&quot; Jade asks. The smile fades from her face, and she looks at you with an intent look. &quot;You seriously want to do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod. &quot;I do. I want to become an object. Just...just for the weekend. To see what it&#39;s like. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m so curious! And...I trust you Jade. You&#39;re my best friend, yeah? I trust you! So...what do you say? Wanna own me for a weekend? Turn me into something?&quot; You smile at her. &quot;But - you gotta promise to use me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade stares at you for a long moment, before her mouth curls into a smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah, alright,&quot; she says. &quot;Meg, you&#39;re crazy, but I guess that&#39;s why I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You squeal, giving her a hug. &quot;You&#39;re awesome Jade!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So...what do you want me to be?&quot; you ask. You spread your arms. &quot;For a weekend, I&#39;ll be yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looks at you, then down at the catalog. She flips through it for a few minutes before smiling, a blush coloring her cheeks. &quot;Mine, huh? Well...&quot;</p>
