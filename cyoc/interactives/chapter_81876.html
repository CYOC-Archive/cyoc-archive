<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Brian thrust his big dick into the wizard's tight ass, he felt a tingle come over him. It was familiar somehow, from the stableboy's memories that had been forced into his mind. He looked up to see the wizard finishing some strange finger movements, while staring intently at the elf-human hybrid. <br />
<br />
Power surged through Brian, and he let out a loud moan of pain and pleasure as the wild energy filled him, making his muscles throb and ache. His thrusts slowed, then ceased, his dick deep in the wizard, as Brian let out a groan of agony. It was quickly followed by pleasured panting though, as Brian's muscles began to expand dramatically, swelling with power and size, becoming large, round, and hard. Brian moaned with pleasure as he felt the wizard's delicate hands wander across his increasingly large arms and pecs. The wizard slowly twisted Brian's nips, eliciting gasps of surprise and excitement from the increasingly large ex-elf. <br />
<br />
&quot;My old lover always got off on this part. I'm glad to see you enjoy it too,&quot; the wizard purred. <br />
<br />
Brian was speechless. His body felt incredible, every muscle fueled by some dark magic, his dick pulsating inside the wizard's increasingly tight ass. Brian was shocked as he realized that his already sizable dick had gotten even bigger! <br />
<br />
Brian glanced over at the cheap mirror on the wall. Even with the distortions in the glass, the changes in his body were obvious. His muscles were spectacularly huge, bulging out freakishly under his skin. His once lithe figure was gone, replaced by a huge hulk of muscle. He was surprised to realize that his powerful torso even outsized Mike's centaur brawn. Brian turned away, looking back down at the wizard, who smirked up at him with satisfaction. <br />
<br />
Brian lost it. Every last shred of restraint dropped, and he growled ferally, resuming his thrusts with increased speed and vigor. Now it was the wizard's turn to show surprise, his eyes widening and his mouth opening into a gasp. Brian smirked, thrusting hard, using his huge new body to full advantage, pounding the wizard's ass hard. The stableboy had never given it to the wizard like this!<br />
<br />
The magic user writhed beneath Brian, or tried to, pain and pleasure warring within him as his hulking creation ravaged his ass. Worried that things were getting a bit out of hand, he began to move his fingers, thinking of a spell to slow the huge elf-hybrid down. Brian reacted swiftly, grabbing the wizard's wrists and immobilizing them. The wizard's eyes went wide with outrage, but before he could speak, Brian had planted a furious kiss on his lips. <br />
<br />
The wizard was 327 years old. For centuries, he had always been in control of every situation he was in, always had a spell or three prepared for various possibilities. In this very moment though, he wasn't in control at all. He felt his body lift up off the bed, and realized that Brian was carrying him through the room, still fucking him. With every step Brian took, the wizard felt it in his ass. The smaller man struggled, trying to get free, but Brian's powerful grip was too strong. The wizard did manage to break the kiss, but before he could utter any words of arcane power his back hit the wall hard. The wizard gasped in shock, both from feeling the rough plaster against his back, and from the way Brian thrust in his huge dick, forcing all fourteen freakish inches of it into the wizard's ass, deeper and harder than Mika had ever gone. <br />
<br />
The wizard surrendered. The sensations he was experiencing were intense - he'd never felt anything like them! The closest comparison he could think of was certain powerful incantations, his body filled with arcane power, threatening to slip out of his control at any second. But even there he was the master. Not here. Not now. And he liked it. Brian kissed him and he returned the kiss, meeting the hulking ex-elf's passion with his own. His own dick was hard against Brian's freaky abs, leaking pre all over them. Sensing the wizard's resistance crumbling, Brian released his wrists, and was rewarded with admiring hands running over his huge muscles, caressing their sweaty mass, pressing against their powerful hardness. Brian flexed obligingly, pounding his huge dick deep and hard into the wizard. He felt the small man tremble, heard him cry out, felt warm cum gush all over his abs. Brian grunted in approval as the wizard's body tensed up from the orgasm, his small but fine glutes clamping down on the muscleelf's oversized rod. All it took was a few more thrusts and Brian was cumming as well, letting out a loud groan of pleasure and accomplishment as his huge dick filled the wizard with a large load of spunk.</p>
