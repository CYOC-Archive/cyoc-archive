<br />
It was Thursday November 23 2023; Thanksgiving Day in America. The Heartpaw household was bustling with activity as Edward and Julian were hosting a Thanks Giving feast. They have been furies for roughly three and a half weeks and have never felt better. Despite the weather getting colder and the first official snow fall predicted around this time, both Edward and Julian didn’t mind; they had a thick coat of luxurious fur to keep them warm and had no need for clothing. Edward being a anthro red fox furry and his wife being an anthro cougar furry. Their daughter Allison also an anthro cougar furry. She was with her mate Jimmy Proudhoof; both currently living next door, and was expected to show up soon along with the rest of the Proudhoofs’ and Soulfangs’.<br />
<br />
“the turkey should be ready an hour after everyone shows up,” Edward closing the oven door after basting the large bird. “Is there a station broadcasting on the television still?” Edward asking his wife as she was busy setting the table for ten.<br />
“The last station went off the air an hour ago,” Julian smiling; “looks like the world is well on its way to going fury.”<br />
“It’s about time,” Edward embracing his wife and giving her a loving kiss; “I guess Denise Proudhoof’s math was off by a week.”<br />
<br />
“It would seem so,” Julian adjusting the center piece. Michael Proudhoof’s mate, a former virologist of the CDC was now an anthro Tigress fury. She developed a prototype method of making the fury virus airborne; accelerating the conversion of humanity a lot faster than fluid transfers do, due to subterfuge or through overt sexual acts. With the help of the doctors’ and nurses at the local hospital; a large amount of the virus was manufactured to be dispersed in the planet’s jet-stream. It was theorized that it would take a week to circulate the planet ensuring every human inhabited location would devolve into rapid fury conversions. Denise explained that this would stymie the CDC and World Health Organization’s attempt to identify a patient zero and work to try and find a cure.<br />
<br />
Denise was surprised to find out after deploying her creation that Julian was said patient zero; the source of the fury virus. Julian’s description as to how she became infected made Denise presume that this was an act of god or gods unknown. Regardless, all felt great and wonderful once they became furies and had no regrets over their new forms or sexual appetites.<br />
“What was on before the station went dark,” Edward nibbling his wife’s rounded ears; finding them to be quite the erogenous zone thanks to their many intimate moments and wild sexual ruts.<br />
“The silly dictator of North Korea being deposed by a mob of furies after he tried to turn his country into a radioactive wasteland with nukes.&quot;<br />
“What an idiot,” Edward responding as he began exploring Julian’s body with his hand paws. Listening to her murmurs of approval as he caressed her tawny brown fur, lightly pinching her nipples and gently squeezing her breasts.<br />
<br />
Earlier reports showed that several attempts to suppress the fury virus through acts of force were met with swift and brutal reprisals. Despite being peaceful and generally pacifists; furies were quick to anger when threaten. Thousands were killed before the militant forces were soon repelled; furies preferring to use their ability to cast magic thanks to their runes to fight back. as like wearing clothing; a fury found using firearms such as hand guns and rifles abhorrent. A live feed of the Russian army shooting furies in Moscow ended up becoming a disaster to Putin as the loyal soldiers he still commanded after his disastrous invasion of Ukraine were soon routed and swiftly killed. There was chanting as the furies march on red square to the Kremlin. While the words were in Russian, a loose translation stated; “reject this gift with violence, then you forfeit your life!” This message was repeated in many languages throughout the world as several other governments also fell due to furies rebelling to military intervention or due to autocratic repression. Most notably Iran and Afghanistan; two countries that treat half of their population as second class citizens. Considering females to be the property of the husband; or in the case of the woman was unwed, the property of the father. Female furies walking about without burkas or any form of covering considered mandatory of the oppressive government was met with brutality. Those repressive regimes were the first to fall as they faced the wrath of a marginalized group of individuals that now had the power to be equal with their male counterparts.<br />
<br />
Incidents of the fury virus killing those in poor health were also documented. Many people in need of organ transplants, those with terminal illnesses such as cancer, Alzheimer&#39;s and those who are elderly were quick to die. The body unable to handle the stress of being transformed, these unfortunate individuals suffered massive heart attacks as they were infected; either from the initial air born deployment or from the secondary wave as furies began to pounce on and jump humans in a passionate haze of lust.<br />
<br />
Edward’s intimate foreplay was interrupted with the sound of the doorbell. Still thankful that power was still going; most likely those who worked at the power station becoming furies and maintaining the important utility. Edward sighs as he and Julian disentangle themselves from each other. Giving each other a once over to make sure they are presentable, despite being naked; they head to the front door and smile as their daughter and Jimmy Proudhoof were waiting from them.<br />
“Allison,” Jullian smiling as she embraced her daughter while Jimmy shook Edward’s hand paw in greeting; the anthro stag-deer now sporting an impressive rack of antlers. Edward did a count and noted at least twelve points.<br />
“Looks like your antlers will be due for another trim,” Edward smiling as Jimmy wipes his hooves on the carpet before stepping onto the hardwood floor.<br />
“Yes,” Jimmy nodding as his runes glow and his antlers shrank and dissolved down to at least four points; “they seem to grow in fast. You should see my father’s rack. It’s quite impressive.”<br />
“I can’t wait,” Edward nodding; “oh you brought some wine!”<br />
“Picked it up at the liquor store,” Jimmy handing over the bottle; “it not the greatest, but with the way the world is going at the moment, I wouldn’t expect new supply of decent spirits for at least a while.”<br />
“Quite alright,” Edward nodding; “most places are adapting to becoming fury better than others.”<br />
“That doesn’t mean that there aren’t pockets of resistance, even here in America,” Jimmy answering as he and Allison are escorted to the living room.<br />
“Managed to get some news over the radio,” Allison chiming in; “the various right wing hate groups and militias made some sort of last stand in Wyoming.”<br />
“Don’t forget Idaho,” Jimmy adding; “and the various Evangelicals are trying to go scorched earth.”<br />
“You’d think they learn after seeing what happened in Russia,” Edward getting the corkscrew to open the wine. Before he could begin the doorbell goes off again.<br />
“Probably Brittany and Jake,” Allison helping her father with the wine as he went to the door.<br />
“How is she doing,” Julian getting the wine glasses to pour the bottle into.<br />
<br />
“I’m doing fine,” Brittany speaking; the anthro gray wolf furry entering the living room and giving Julian and Allison a quick kiss; “Pregnant but fine. Multiple test kits confirmed I am growing a cub. And no it’s too soon to tell its gender.”<br />
“We agreed to not know or find out if it will be a wolf or deer fury,” Jake embracing his mate; “at least until after birth.”<br />
“So no gender reveal party,” Julian looking sad; “have you told Lucas and Rachael?”<br />
“As well as dad and stepmom,” Jake accepting the wine while Brittany was given a wine glass full of apple juice. She accepted with polite grace but was a little down that she had to abstain from alcohol for the time being.<br />
“Will Michael and Denise be here soon,” Edward reappearing into the living room before heading to the kitchen; “I should give the bird one final check.”<br />
“Let me help,” Jake putting down his wine.<br />
“Brother,” Jimmy sipping the white wine; “just relax for the day. There are other holidays to come where you can play host.”<br />
“Fine,” the brown eyed twin responding as he escorts Brittany to the recliner as he choose to sit on the nearby matching foot stool.<br />
“I take it the stations are dead,” Jake eying the no signal message on the t.v.<br />
<br />
Before anyone could answer, the door bell goes off and Julian gets up to head to the front door as Edward was in the kitchen still. Answering the door she is greeted by both Lucas and Racheal Soulfang with both Michael and Denise Proudhoof trailing up behind them.<br />
“Welcome,” Julian beaming as the anthro wolf fury and his anthro lioness mate give the cougar fury a warm hug. “Hurry up and get in so I can greet Michael and Denise.”<br />
“Is Brittany here,” Rachael holding an object wrapped in tin foil; “oh we brought a pecan pie.”<br />
“Now that’s a tasty pie,” Michael approaching; just as Jimmy spoke earlier, the elder stag-deer fury had a large rack of antlers. Julian noting at least eighteen points as he entered with Denise close behind.<br />
<br />
“Oh come here my daughter and give mommy a hug,” Rachael walking into the living room; “how is you mate treating you.”<br />
Mom,” Brittany feeling embarrassed; “I’m fine. And Jake has been nothing but a gentleman with me.”<br />
“But your heat,” Rachael sounding concerned; “you made it sound like that it was an unbearable event and Jake was rather rough.”<br />
“Oh thanks,” Jake rolling his eyes as he found his mother inlaw’s veiled insult in poor taste.<br />
“Mom,” Brittany not amused; “yes Jake was a little rough when I was in heat. But that doesn’t mean he meant it. It was my pheromones that threw him for a loop. Something you should bear in mind when you enter it and give dad a nose full from your feline twat.”<br />
Lucas nearly chokes on the white wine he was offered at that comment, while both Michael and Denise mearly chuckled.<br />
<br />
“How is the new place,” Michael changing the subject; “are the neighbors treating you well?”<br />
“The neighbors are great,” Jake nodding; “the place is a little on the small side, but we are making it work.”<br />
“Plenty of room for a couple of cubs along with us,” Brittany smiling at her mate; “you should thank you brother for the ideal of moving into your mother’s condo.”<br />
“Well I do have a mind for finances,” Jimmy holding up his glass in salute; “I got that from mom.”<br />
“And I got the cooking skills from dad,” Jake trying to one up his twin brother.<br />
“Born two minutes ahead of you,” Jimmy getting up; an urge to butt heads with his brother welling within.<br />
“Stop,” Jake putting down his wine; “this sibling rivalry is getting childish. Plus I get to be a father and give dad a grandcub well before you, so I win” Jake smirking as he makes a quick scamper next to the Proudhoof patriarch.<br />
“Alright,” Michael shaking his head; “enough you two; there is enough violence going on in the world, we don’t need you two adding to it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh did I forget,” Jimmy adding one last jab; “I was able to purchase the house next door from the bank. Free and clear of a mortgage.”<br />
“Free of a mortgage,” Jake responds in a mocked tone.<br />
Before Michael Proudhoof could shut the impromptu pissing contest down; Edward reentered the living room; grabbing a glass of wine, he notices another bottle of that Denise brought with her; this one a red wine and of a rare vintage.<br />
“This should go well with the turkey,” Edward nodding in approval; “which by the way is ready. So if everyone would like to go to the dining room, we can begin to eat and give thanks to what we have.”<br />
“A fine ideal,” Julian getting up and helping to diffuse the tense situation that Jimmy and Jake just caused.</p>
