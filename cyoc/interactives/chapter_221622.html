<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vic buried his face in the pillow as Trey&#39;s thrusts grew more determined, his own cock was twitching, close to release and he didn&#39;t think the other man was far behind. Powerful hands gripped Vic&#39;s hips as he felt himself being spread open on Trey&#39;s beer can thick tool. That first day they had finally given it a try was an uncomfortable experience for Vic. Now, a couple days later, it felt so good and right. He was sure he had his changing body to thank for that more than just the sessions he kept having with Trey, and there were more than a few, this was the fourth today. As the week progressed, Vic&#39;s libido seemed to be growing, something Trey was only too happy to help him with.<br />
<br />
Vic moaned as his cock twitched, emptying his balls once more as ropes of thick cum hit the bed beneath him. He didn&#39;t know where it came from, he should have been dry by now, but there always seemed to be more. His balls had grown in size the last couple of days, looking oversized below his still average cock. Trey grunted as he slammed home one more time, filling Vic&#39;s hole with his seed. He waited until he was done to pull free of Vic, who dropped to the bed on his side, breathing heavily. A much heavier flop behind him signaled Trey joining him, and soon a powerful arm was wrapped around him, pulling him close, a series of kisses pressed to the back of his neck.<br />
<br />
Vic leaned back into Trey, enjoying the feeling of that fuzzy chest and stomach up against his back. &quot;You know, it&#39;s been a week since we met now.&quot; Trey rumbled, his hand running over Vic&#39;s chest, playing with the light dusting of hair in the middle of his chest. It still hadn&#39;t spread much since it appeared, in fact the last couple days had only seen some muscle growth which Vic wasn&#39;t too upset about, his arms, legs, and chest now had some noticeable definition, nothing to write home about, but more than he had ever had before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can only remember five days though.&quot; Vic said. Some spots of that weekend sometimes intruded on his thoughts, but nothing he could pin down for long.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll come back. Though, not much to remember, a lot of sex and eating. More than we&#39;re doing now.&quot; Trey laughed, resting his chin atop Vic&#39;s head as they basked.<br />
<br />
&quot;More than this?&quot; Vic laughed, disbelieving. &quot;I&#39;m exhausted with this pace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just think of it like extra puberty. You&#39;re getting bigger, hair growing in weird places, and just being really fucking horny. It&#39;ll calm down once you&#39;re done, enjoy it while it lasts. If anything I should be the one who&#39;s worn out.&quot; Trey echoed Vic&#39;s laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s slowing down.&quot; Vic muttered, placing a hand over Trey&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not even close, your body is probably just working on things inside getting ready for some impressive changes, trust me. I&#39;ve been there. Besides, I can confirm your ass is getting better by the day.&quot;  Vic felt Trey squeeze one of his cheeks then give it a playful slap. &quot;Why don&#39;t you get cleaned up, I&#39;ll change the sheets and make you something to eat.&quot; Trey started to get up, unentangling himself from Vic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might as well wait on the sheets until we&#39;re about to go to bed, unless you like doing laundry five times a day.&quot; Vic muttered sitting up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Point taken.&quot; Trey said, leaning in to kiss Vic, something that was surprisingly tender and gentle from the big man. He was learning Trey had multiple kisses, rough would mean he was in the mood for sex, he had a teasing one for when he was feeling playful, and then the tender ones, which he just seemed to sprinkle through the day just to remind Vic he was around.<br />
<br />
Vic hated to admit it, but this week long romance was probably the best he ever had, and he knew deep down he was falling for Trey, but he worried how much of that was the instinct Trey sometimes mentioned. After all, he had never considered being with a guy before, though maybe he should have. Clothes having not been worn by either of them since Wednesday, except by Trey to answer the door for food delivery or trips out, he watched Trey stride off out of the bedroom, eyes lingering on his backside, at least until he heard his phone chime.<br />
<br />
It took him a moment to find it on the nightstand. It had been going off periodically the last ten minutes, but he was too occupied to care. There were a couple of messages from Dave asking for clarification on some of the projects he had handed off, and more from Trish about drinks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit..&quot; Vic muttered. He got up and wandered out into the apartment living area where Trey was already in the kitchen working away at his latest meal. More and more Vic was convinced Trey made his living as a chef or something. He plopped on the couch, and started texting back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t clean up.&quot; Trey said, more teasing than admonishing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? You&#39;re just going to get me all sweaty and messy in another hour or so anyway.&quot; Vic replied, maybe with a bit more heat than intended as he stared at his phone. He hated to cancel, but did he even have a choice. The changes he had may not seem drastic, but in a week and in the eyes of his best friend, they&#39;d be hard to explain.<br />
<br />
&#39;Sorry Trish, something came up, need to reschedule&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; The deep voice was soft as Trey came over, leaning on the back of the couch as he looked at the phone over Vic&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Oh..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh&#39;s right.&quot; Vic muttered. &quot;I hate lying to my friends. Why can&#39;t I just tell her, invite her over and explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t end well, it never ends well.&quot; Trey leaned forward more and wrapped his arms around Vic. &quot;I&#39;m trying to give you the time you need, but eventually you&#39;ll need to cut ties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know! Part of me just wishes you&#39;d have left me alone. &quot; Vic snapped, leaning back in the sofa. He spotted Trey&#39;s face, who looked surprisingly hurt by the comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would have happened anyway.&quot; Trey said softly, placing a hand on Vic&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Better that I&#39;m here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know..&quot; Vic said, biting back another acid comment. Instead he leaned his cheek against Trey&#39;s hand, the touch instantly calming his frayed nerves. &quot;Is this why you don&#39;t share things about yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Trey answered. &quot;I don&#39;t want to get too attached until I know you&#39;ll be sticking around.&quot; He withdrew his hand and started walking back towards the kitchen. &quot;Some cubs don&#39;t take cutting off their old life well and take it out on their mentors.&quot; Those words made Vic flinch. &quot;It makes it easier for them to do the cutting if they cut out the one who bridged that gap, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother married his though?&quot; Vic said, maybe trying to dig a bit more out. &quot;You kept in touch with him, didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He did.&quot; Trey said. &quot;That also happens. And he&#39;s not really my brother.&quot; Trey said, finally dropping another tidbit about himself. &quot;We were born about the same time and so went through our changes at the same time. Actually. Our mentors were best friends, and all four of us weathered the month out together. They&#39;re like my family, but aren&#39;t blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh..&quot; Vic said softly, watching some loophole evaporate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stick around and I&#39;ll introduce you some day.&quot; Trey said, obviously trying to lighten the mood a little.<br />
<br />
Vic&#39;s phone chimed and brought his attention back down.<br />
<br />
&#39;Tomorrow?&#39; Was the single message back from Trish.<br />
<br />
He stared at his phone screen for a long few minutes before replying, &#39;I took the week off, taking a trip, leaving tomorrow morning&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;With mystery guy?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You must like him&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I think I really do&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well, have fun, we&#39;ll catch up when you get back, luv ya&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Luv ya 2&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trey.&quot; Vic said, his voice sounding a little hoarse even to his ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; The other man asked, looking up from where he was throwing some chicken breasts into a pan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think maybe we should go to your cabin tomorrow.&quot; Vic looked over to Trey to see him breaking out into a wide grin, excitement clear on his face, and eagerness. It soothed the hurt he was feeling over Trish almost instantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! We&#39;ll need to get you something to make the trip in, but it&#39;s only a couple of hours driving away, you&#39;ll love it there. I promise!&quot; Trey was practically giddy, almost boyish in his eagerness. &quot;We&#39;ll need to pick up some groceries, too. Few other supplies, there&#39;s a store on the way we can hit up.&quot; Trey kept on going and Vic just letting the rambling words wash over him as he tried to imagine the cozy little cabin in the middle of the woods. It might be nice to rough it for a bit.</p>
