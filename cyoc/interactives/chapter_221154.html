<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Angus was really pleased to see that Samantha had changed her mind and would join him and Jordan for a coffee across the road. He was glad for a number of reasons. The first was that Samantha was hot. Really hot. Just his type. Secondly she wasn’t throwing herself at him like a lot of girls did. She had made it clear earlier that she wanted to keep this meeting platonic, but Angus loved a challenge. The third reason was related to the second. Jordan was a pretty girl but not in Samantha’s league. The short brunette was pretty and petite but through the evening she had let be known that she was available. To Angus that unfortunately was a turn-off. He was glad that Samantha was coming so that Jordan didn’t get the wrong impression.<br />
<br />
He did notice that Samantha had redone her lips. Maybe his charm was having some effect?<br />
<br />
Angus spent the rest of the evening finding out what he could about Samantha. He didn’t broach her love life but she seemed open about talking sports and proved to be a big basketball fan, even knowing some of the players on his team’s roster. He initially suspected she had possibly just done her homework on him and knew of his interests. But after asking a few probing questions he discovered she genuinely was a fan and had played throughout high school. However she clammed up when he asked what school she had gone to and what position she had played. Perhaps an invitation to courtside seats when his team visited their city in a few week’s time might be appreciated, however he would keep that idea for later.<br />
<br />
Angus was surprised that Samantha was also knowledgeable about the latest electronic games. She certainly wasn’t the bimbo cheerleader type that she looked like. She had a sharp mind, but then again that made sense as she was a technical expert at this small company which had come up with what at least on the surface was a breakthrough management software package. She certainly wasn’t your typical IT nerd. Angus was intrigued. He didn’t usually admit it but he enjoyed a bit of gaming himself.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to sign contracts with a fly by night operation, he had done his own homework on the company the girls were representing. He found Jordan’s profile easily enough, she was an account manager and had worked there for two years since graduating from college with a bachelor of Arts. She was a ballet dancer but not quite good enough to be a professional. The only mention of Sam Colson he had found, was a picture of a chubby man at some award ceremony. Perhaps this male had just been picking up an award for an absent Samantha? She became cagey when he asked her what role she held in the company, replying “It’s complicated” before hurriedly changing the subject back to basketball. Angus let the matter drop.<br />
<br />
Angus also asked whether the girls had any other business in town, as he knew they were staying two nights. Jordan replied by asking him whether he had any suggestions of other companies that it might be worth her while to contact. She wrote the names he suggested into her phone, saying she might make some initial enquires in the afternoon. It seemed Samantha was planning to stay in the hotel room during the afternoon and work remotely on her laptop.<br />
<br />
After the coffees and deserts he suggested they visit a nearby bar, but Samantha begged that she was tired and had probably drunk enough already considering she had to give her presentation in the morning. Angus could see that Jordan was disappointed that her colleague didn’t want to continue with the evening but reluctantly acceded to Samantha’s wishes. Angus walked them back across the road giving both girls a kiss on the hand knight style. In response Jordan giggled with delight, while Samantha blushed with embarrassment. Was he making an impression?</p>
