<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer grumbled to herself as she pulled up her panties and put on the other sock - she still had no idea where her cheerleader top was, and that call with that total loser...what was his name again? Kevin? Karl? Oh whatever, it didn&#39;t fucking matter. Making weird calls like that, it was no wonder she and her friends had ended up pantsing him in front of everyone. <br />
<br />
With a sigh, she sat down on the bed and looked around her room. It was nice and tidy, as always. Which made the lack of cheerleader top particularly frustrating - god, had Maria tried to wash it or something? She&#39;d told her not to mess with her cheerleader stuff, but half the time she was pretty sure Maria didn&#39;t even speak fluent English, so who knew what she got up to. Ugh! Maybe she&#39;d have to speak to her Mom about getting cameras put in. Then she smirked; her boyfriend would probably like the idea of cameras being in here...<br />
<br />
She looked over at the mirror and her smirk widened. God, the boys at school would probably just explode if she showed up like this, wearing only her bra. She cupped her modest sized breasts.<br />
<br />
Well, unless she wanted to be later than she already was, she&#39;d have to throw on a regular top or something. <br />
<br />
Except--<br />
<br />
She frowned, turning back to the mirror.<br />
<br />
Then she slowly stood up and walked closer to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck...?&quot; she muttered, lifting a hand to her nose.<br />
<br />
Her nose was...it was turning blue. Like she&#39;d been punched in the nose and it was bruising or something! Except - holy shit, it was spreading! <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; she whispered, eyes growing wide. She pushed on her nose, but - there was no pain. No pain at all. But there was...something. Her nose felt a little squishier. Almost...wet. And when she took her finger away, she noticed that there was a bit of bluish/purple liquid on it.<br />
<br />
As she watched, the patch of blue began to spread further, covering her cheeks and face, turning every bit of her skin blue. She felt her breath start to pick up in intensity as she watched - this - this couldn&#39;t be happening! What was going on?<br />
<br />
And then a very odd sensation began to build up within her. &quot;Shit!&quot; she gasped, her arms going down to tenderly touch her stomach. There was a sudden sense of pressure, like - like she&#39;d drunk too much soda or something and had to belch (not that she ever did publicly, thank you very much). But - this was different. More intense. And there was no sensation like she had to burp or anything else. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is going on??&quot; she cried, looking back up at the mirror.<br />
<br />
Her entire head had turned blue now. Her mouth fell open - even the inside of her mouth was blue! And she could see the blue/purple tint spreading down her hair even, and when she went to go comb through her hair, it came away with more of the liquid. And then the blue/purple color began to spread down her arms as well - and it was beginning to spread down her chest as well!<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; she shouted, looking down at her rapidly changing body. As the discoloration spread, the odd sensation in her gut seemed to become more intense. She let out a grunt, and looked down, eyes widening again - her stomach - it was starting to - holy shit, it was expanding! She could see it plumping up a bit, and felt another gurgling sensation. <br />
<br />
She looked back up in the mirror, her chest heaving with anxiety now - and her eyes widened again when she saw that her pink bra had been stained purple. With trembling hands, she removed her bra and looked at her bare chest in dismay - even her nipples had turned a dark purple. <br />
<br />
The gurgling sensation picked up again and she let out a moan of discomfort - and this time, a sense of pressure from her ass. She turned around with a whimper and looked back in the mirror. Now her ass was expanding - and her stomach was still getting bigger! <br />
<br />
By this point, her body was entirely blue. Her white socks had been stained purple, and when she took a step, she left behind a slight purple footprint. <br />
<br />
And then her mind thought of the call.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she said, shaking her head. &quot;No, no, no. That guy was just a fuckin&#39; weirdo. This isn&#39;t happening - this isn&#39;t happening - this isn&#39;t - shit!!&quot; She let out a frustrated squeal as she looked down, feeling a sudden cutting sensation as the combination of her stomach and ass expanding made her panties become uncomfortably tight. She reached down to try and get her fingers underneath them to get them off - but they were too tight now - and when she looked back in the mirror - her hips were expanding as well. Her whole midsection was plumping out further and further, and Jenny winced, feeling the panties becoming very uncomfortable--<br />
<br />
RIIIIIP!<br />
<br />
And then they snapped off and her skin jiggled out, eagerly growing to fill the unimpeded space.<br />
<br />
And only when she took a step back did Jenny realize that she had to do something about this. <br />
<br />
What was it that loser had said? How had that story gone? Like she was going to remember some dumb story they&#39;d read as kids - fuck, she probably hadn&#39;t even read it! Something about getting the juice out of her...? Is that what this shit was? Juice??<br />
<br />
And now that she thought about it, she realized that it had to be true. In the chaos of the changes, she hadn&#39;t even noticed, but there was a persistent taste of blueberries in her mouth. <br />
<br />
She quickly walked over to her phone, groaning as her body jiggled with the increased mass. It was definitely more of a strain just to move around now - her stomach stuck out like she was pregnant, and her ass had doubled in size. <br />
<br />
She picked up the phone and quickly dialed her best friend&#39;s number. Surely Tessa would help her. <br />
<br />
The phone rang. And rang. <br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon!&quot; she groaned. <br />
<br />
There was a new gurgling sensation - except, this time, it came from her chest. She let out a gasp and looked down - now her breasts were beginning to expand, and - was that something leaking out of her nipples? More juice! Shit...!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; asked a voice on the phone.<br />
<br />
Right as Jenny said, &quot;Shit, not my tits too!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an awkward moment of silence on the other end of the phone. &quot;Uh. The fuck? Jenny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tessa!&quot; Jenny shouted. &quot;I need - have you left for school yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just on my way out,&quot; the other girl said, still sounding curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I need help!&quot; Jenny said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh-kaaaay....&quot; Tessa said hesitantly. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny shook her head. &quot;I genuinely don&#39;t know how to explain this,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Just...please come over...I...ngh!&quot; She winced as the expansion seemed to intensify a bit. Her breasts surged forward, doubling in size - her stomach and sides had rounded out, becoming wide enough that it was beginning to make her legs tremble from the increased weight. &quot;Hurry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Tessa said, a mix of curiosity, concern, and annoyance in her voice. &quot;On my way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny hung up the phone and staggered back, almost losing her footing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop growing!&quot; she shouted at her expanding body.<br />
<br />
But of course, it didn&#39;t listen. The sense of pressure only seemed to increase, and then, there was an entirely new sense of pressure - she could feel her entire middle section just...begin to grow. Everything was growing now. Even her cunt - which was sopping wet, probably with juice, she thought miserably - was beginning to press outwards, expanding between her legs. And her legs were trembling, except - when she finally gave way - she didn&#39;t fall all that far. <br />
<br />
Instead, when she fell, her midsection, which had begun to bloat outward in a sphere, simply took her weight. She could feel her legs being...it was like they were being sucked into her body. She let out a scream as her body grew larger - and all the while, her ass was growing, rounding out, as were her tits, which filled the bottom part of her vision, jiggling with every bit of movement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop....stop!&quot; she shouted. <br />
<br />
And then her arms were forced to stick out as the expansion began to overtake the top half of her body as well. The sensations of pressure increased, and she let out a long moan of fear. <br />
<br />
And as her legs were sucked into her body and her feet stuck out pathetically, unable to make contact with anything, she felt her throbbing cunt make contact with the floor as her body expanded more, pushing her higher up. She was completely at the mercy of her own body now - unable to move her feet at all and only barely able to move her feet and toes. And the sensation of pressure on her pussy was sending entirely new sensations through her - making it feel damn good, even though that was the opposite of her mental state.<br />
<br />
And she could feel her arms being absorbed more and more, and her shoulders and torso were plumping up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone...help...me...mmmph!&quot; she shouted, before the sensation of pressure increased and her torso swelled up around her neck and chin. <br />
<br />
Soon, all that was left of Jenny was her head, which stuck out of a divot at the top - her hands, which were wriggling helplessly to the side - her feet, which twitched from the sensations of her throbbing clit grinding into the carpet below, leaking pools of blue juice - and her breasts, which continued to inflate and made her body roll forward slightly, to the point where her massive tits rested on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;MMMMPH!&quot; she moaned, what little movements she could make resulting from how good it was beginning to feel.<br />
<br />
And still she grew! Her body, one giant sphere, with her breasts sticking out ridiculously in front...it was all slowly getting bigger. And she could barely see her face in the mirror, so far had her head sunken down into her juicy body. But she could see her wide eyes - eyes that had, that morning, been hazel, and were now a deep blue.<br />
<br />
<i>TESSA, HURRY THE FUCK UP, I DON&#39;T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN LAST!</i> Jenny thinks to herself.</p>
