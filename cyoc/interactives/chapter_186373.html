<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Noah paused and looked over what he had written: &quot;The following changes won&#39;t take effect until I blink my eyes after I finish writing them. After I blink and these changes take effect, all future changes will go into effect as normal unless I specify otherwise. I am a seven-foot-five-inches tall man with a muscular body similar to a movie star with the minimal amount of body fat needed for survival. I have six arms, four legs, and an 18 pack. My four legs all end in hands instead of feet, though these hands are capable of functioning as feet without issue. I have two mouths stacked on top of each other and can use them independently of each other to talk, eat, breathe, etc. I&#39;m able to survive without oxygen for up to 48 hours before suffering the effects a normal human would suffer from oxygen deprivation.<br />
<br />
&quot;My family adopted me because of my unique differences and have always loved me. My parents are disappointed that their children did not have my unique features and my brothers is jealous of me for them and respect me more because of this. There are no health complications from me being the way I am and no one is concerned about how unusual it is, though they may still recognize and politely comment that it&#39;s unusual rather than being abusive or fearful.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled as he reread his ideal fantasy body and slowly blinked his eyes. When he opened them, he realized he could feel his changes happening as if time had slowed down and quickly pulled off his shirt. First he realized that his vantage point was getting progressively higher as his entire body lengthened to his new 7&#39; 5&quot; height. He smirked as he saw that his faint six-pack was comically stretched to account for his new height. His new muscles began to reshape, some inflating and some shifting to become more toned as his skin tightened around them until he looked like he could star in a superhero movie. He was surprised to watch it happen without feeling anything in the muscles themselves, but he felt his blood rushing to his crotch as the sight of his changing body aroused him.<br />
<br />
Next his sides began to indent and change shape, as if his torso were a shirt he was wearing over his arms. He lifted his arms and marveled at the feeling of them being simultaneously lifted and trapped at his sides. His two new arms took shape at his sides as if being sculpted from clay, until at last the new appendages were freed and could move about. The process then repeated itself until he had six arms, the shoulders of the ones below nestled snugly in the armpit of the ones above.<br />
<br />
Noah grunted as his height increased even more, his legs splitting amoeba-like until there were four of them, a slight bit of flesh growing between them until he had a hind butt and a forebutt from which his second set of legs grew. He stood up and gasped as he realized he could feel the hefty weight of not one but two erections, one between each pair of legs. As he bent over to admire them he realized he was slightly more flexible and felt his spine was curving in a slightly odder arch. He looked to his chest and discovered the reason was that his oversized abs were dividing into an eighteen-pack that allowed for a bit more flexibility as one muscle became three. He licked his lips at the sight and reached for his cocks when he felt his balance shifting slightly as his toes lengthened and his feet reshifted into hands. With a grin, he leapt onto his bed and used the hands on his hindlegs to gently stroke his front cock as his hind boner pushed into his front butt. He gasped as he realized he could feel it teasing a second anus and knew he would have a lot of fun once his changes were through.<br />
<br />
He let out a yell of excitement as he realized his changes were happening sequentially as he had written them. His yell quickly amplified as his jaw stretched down to accommodate his second mouth. He could feel some internal changes taking place now, but they didn&#39;t matter as he used his many hands to massage his two dicks, turning his excited yell into a loud moan. When everything was done, he felt his new memories filling his head, and spared a split second to ponder how he could remember two realities before feeling his cocks begging for release. Though his mind told him he&#39;d fucked himself plenty of times before, it also told him this was his first time and he needed to try it immediately.</p>
