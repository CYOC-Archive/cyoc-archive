<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Friday morning eventually dawned and came to Moon Lake, as the Earth&#39;s rotation made sure that it always did. As it came, Martha and William Anderson were both awakened by the alarm and got them both sitting up. William quietly reached over and flicked a switch that turned off the radio. He glanced over his shoulder to see Martha stretching as she sat on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; William said to her with a small smile as he began to transform back, his fur pulling back inside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Martha answered with a small smile of her own and as her head and skull altered into more of a human like shape. Her ears rounding and moving to the sides of her head and as her muzzle shrank back into the more flat human face.<br />
<br />
The transformation wasn&#39;t painful, despite how it looked as their muzzles pushed back into their faces, as tails retracted back into their spines, and as their feet shrank down to let them take a more plantigrade stance. It looked painful, but it wasn&#39;t. The sensation that William and Martha felt as they transformed back was like they were saying goodbye to a very good friend... like their fursonas were who they truly were. But they did have to transform back to get ready for their respective jobs. They then turned to each other as they moved to go around the bed before moving toward the bathroom and the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had the most interesting dreams...&quot; William said slowly to her as they entered the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;So did I,&quot;Martha responded as she turned on the water for the shower, &quot;one was you being a character reference for Nate as part the adoption process and then one with me visiting Eric and Julie... and talking about Wilma.&quot;<br />
<br />
William&#39;s eyes widened as Martha spoke, &quot;I had the same dreams... that you wouldn&#39;t have her in your classroom...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I&#39;d stayed on the job in Minnesota, I wouldn&#39;t have had Nate or Eric in my classroom either,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;as students don&#39;t begin to go from class to class and I wouldn&#39;t want to put myself in a situation where anyone could claim I&#39;m favoring my children over others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense,&quot; William commented as Martha beckoned him to the shower, &quot;You don&#39;t suppose this was a prophecy dream... do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Martha shrugged, &quot;It might be something to talk to Frances about... but if it is... it does have some good news...&quot;<br />
<br />
With both of them in the shower now, Martha moved to test the temperature of the water while William moved to set the shower curtain. She could hear the cling of the curtain as William closed the curtain while she ran her feet under the water coming out of the faucet. It was sufficiently warm  and with that, she bent over to the lever at the top of the faucet and lifted it, opening the valves that sent the water up to the shower head above them. Both of them soon felt the spray of warm water hit them as they stood together, and in fact after lifting that lever to turn on the shower, Martha felt William come right up beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That we will have a daughter,&quot; William said to her.<br />
<br />
Martha smiled as they embraced. The fact that their sons were growing up wasn&#39;t something that she was fully ready for and the fact that it had come so quick for her was going to take some getting used to. She could be fairly secure that Julie was keeping Eric grounded and that Alex seemed like a good match for Nate, and that was something that she could accept and would be something that would let her get ready for when Nate and Eric did move out. However, that wasn&#39;t the thing that was the good news that Martha had seen in her dream. The good news was that she and William would have a daughter in the future, and that pleased her greatly. They&#39;d originally planned to have both a son and a daughter, though after Eric was born, it was agreed that they wouldn&#39;t be able to afford a third child, and so they had agreed to raise the children they had. However, now as weres and with their lifespans greatly extended, they both knew that when Nate and Eric moved out to start their own lives, they could start again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... we will have a daughter,&quot; Martha answered, as they released from the hug and William began to softly scrub her body with one bar of soap while she returned the favor with another bar of soap, &quot;Wilma.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this a Flintstones fan creeping out of you?&quot; William teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... but Wilma isn&#39;t necessarily a bad name the feminine form of William,&quot; Martha pointed out.<br />
<br />
William blinked, &quot;You&#39;d... you&#39;d name her after me? But... I thought we agreed with Nate and Eric that we wouldn&#39;t name our kids after us because some of that was sorta silly...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two came close in the shower, and both doing their best not to let their closeness lead to anything they didn&#39;t have time for,  but they were close. Martha could only smile as she felt the water from the shower wash the suds off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;d suppose in this specific case it wouldn&#39;t exactly be naming a child after one of us, unless your name is actually Wilma and you&#39;ve been pretending to be William since we&#39;ve known each other,&quot; Martha gave a small giggle.<br />
<br />
There was a quiet moment while William reached over to a side tray for some shampoo for them to use.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t like it?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind the name Wilma,&quot; William answered, &quot;I just didn&#39;t expect you&#39;d spring for it. It was a surprise... but like so many of the surprises we&#39;ve had since coming here... it&#39;s not a bad one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha couldn&#39;t resist it. Even while William was scrubbing shampoo into her hair, she turned and pressed herself against him and gave him a very passionate kiss. Things had been surprising and their sons were growing up fast, but things wouldn&#39;t be too bad. Having a daughter would a great thing, something that she and William had wanted. Now that they were weres, they&#39;d get the chance to try again and William was okay with the name.</p>
