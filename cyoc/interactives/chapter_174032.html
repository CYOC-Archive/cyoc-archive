<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The entire room was tense as people tried to process what was happening, Rose and Nate stayed up in the corner just being together not really talking or even doing anything. Maybe it was everything that had happened or the changes which was sweeping over their bodies but in time Nate fell asleep. Rose could feel his body slacken a bit as he relaxed a bit as sleep took him. She could feel sleep coming on herself as she push/pulled Nate back so that instead of sitting on the edge of the stone slab/bed he could lie on it. She lied beside him, it was a tight fit but all the more reason for her to pull herself closer to him. She closed her eyes and let sleep take her as well. <br />
<br />
Hours later her eyes opened up to find the room was darkened with the large blue stone which was the main source of light had faded. Sam, Taylor, Mike and Stacy had said that it had dimmed in the evening and so she guessed judging by the light and how she felt that it must be in the middle of the night. Slowly she pulled away from Nate who was still sound asleep and slid off the slab and began to float down. She didn’t even have to kick her tail all that much, she just dropped down. The room was quiet with the sound of people sleeping. In the semi-dark she could see every couple was attempting to sleep together, to be close to someone else as they changed. <br />
<br />
Once on the ground level she flicked her tail and shot into the bathroom chamber, here was possibly the weirdest thing she had seen so far. It looked like a toilet but instead of water it had a vacuum like suction which took away waste. She was still half asleep so she just did her business and was about to go back to bed when she looked at herself in the large full length mirror. <br />
<br />
Her eyes widened a bit, while she had slept her body had started to change. Her eyes always green had turned even brighter shade of green to the point they almost seamed to glow a bit, her red hair had also turned brighter but with a few strains of pink mixed in. Her hair was still as about shoulder length so that hadn’t changed but unless she was mistaken her breasts had grown at least a half cup size maybe even more. They strained a bit against her bikini top, so far however none of her white scales had changed colors. She kept turning around to get a better look at herself in the mirror, she liked what she saw, the look of her tail was still throwing her off but she tried not to look at it.<br />
<br />
“This is just weird.” Said Rose<br />
<br />
“You have no idea.” Added a new voice as Rose turned to see Amanda sitting against the wall just on the outside of the bathroom door. She was just looking out into the darkness and judging by how puffy her eyes where she had been crying for a while. “It is even stranger watching the changes as they happen.”<br />
<br />
“Amanda have you gotten any sleep?” inquired Rose as Amanda shock her head, in the semi-darkness it was impossible to make out much details about what was happening to her. <br />
<br />
“I have been fighting it, I want to stay as human as I can for as long as I can.” Explained an exhausted Amanda as she leaned back a bit putting her back against the stone walls. “But it hasn’t really work.”<br />
<br />
“No…I assumed it wouldn’t.” stated Rose “What has changed about you.” <br />
<br />
“A lot.” Said Amanda with a heavy sigh as she pushed off her seat and moved into the light. Rose’s eyes widened, Amanda had changed a lot. Her eyes had changed to a lilac color while her long dark hair remained the same color it looked smoother and thicker. Her breasts always the largest of any of their female friend group was the same size but her core looked toner like she had been working out. Her tail was filling in rapidly on one side with a mixture of lilac and deep dark purple. It was strange a pattern seamed to have formed, with the light lilac around her hips and down her side with the dark purple going the rest of the way down the front and back. Her left side was still totally white along with the last foot or so of her tail and the membrane which made up the tail remained white. <br />
<br />
“You look good.” Said Rose as Amanda shrugged. <br />
<br />
“I must admit I do like how I look.” Said Amanda before she let out a sigh and looked around the room. In the darkness she could see where the others slept. “I just wish I wasn’t alone.”<br />
<br />
“You are not alone.” Countered Rose before she realized what Amanda was talking about. “Oh…sorry, ya you mean you don’t have a boyfriend here to be with you.”<br />
<br />
“Ya…” sighed Amanda as Rose raised an eyebrow, something was off.<br />
<br />
“I…I almost asked someone to come with us on this vacation but decided against it.” Admitted Amanda<br />
<br />
“You should have…we had room in the yacht for another person.” Added Rose before Amanda shock her head. <br />
<br />
“Then they would be transforming like we are…no, better for them to have a life on land.” Stated Amanda<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry we will get out of here.” stated Rose<br />
<br />
“Sure.” And now it was time for Amanda to sound unconvinced.<br />
<br />
“Get some sleep.” Ordered Rose as she pressed her hand on Amanda’s shoulder and swam off. She returned to Nate and snuggling back in let sleep take her again. <br />
<br />
 When she awoke again there was a lot of activity happening below her, she looked over the edge to see mermaids and merman bringing in food. She watched as they brought in food and left. <br />
<br />
“Ah…good you are awake…I really need to use the bathroom.” Said Nate as he lied looking down on her, she was using his chest as a pillow. <br />
<br />
“You could have just woken me up.” Said Rose as she gave him a kiss before sitting up, she looked at Nate. His body seamed to have gained a little muscle, he was never the body builder type and he had a swimmer’s body but now it was more defined. Web skin now filled in his hand from the knuckles, the membrane had a dark reddish orange color. A couple of small fins had started to grow from his tail, it kind of reminded her of the fins one would find on the tail of a shark. His white tail had begun to fill in with a mixture of reddish orange, bright orange and black. It was not fully filled in yet.<br />
<br />
As she was studying the changes in Nate, Nate was studying the changes in Rose. He had been asleep the entire night and had only seen her change hair while he watched her sleep on his chest. He tried not to look at his girlfriend’s chest which had grown and was threatening to overflow her red swimsuit top. It wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t want to look, he wanted to take her top off and have some fun but he knew Rose was always a little concerned about her small chest, he didn&#39;t know why she thought that but he wasn&#39;t going to make her feel bad. His eyes moved down, her scales had started to come in with a bright red and dark red with a few pinks mixed in. Like him she had some fins coming in but it in different places. He had noticed that mermans and mermaids had fins in different places, maybe that was a sexual trait.<br />
<br />
It was by midmorning by the time everyone was up. Sam’s and Taylor’s tails where almost fully filled in with scales black and red for Sam and different shades of yellow for Taylor. Fins larger than what had come in on them. Mike and Stacy where filling in as well, Mike’s with multiple different shades of green while Stacy was a mixtures of tans, browns and a few golden scales, unlike the others there didn’t seam to be any physical changes to their bodies besides the tails. Their changes seamed almost totally done as they looked just like the mermaids and merman who came into the room every so often. <br />
<br />
Being a day behind the four of their friends everyone else about halfway through the transformation. Amanda’s transformation hadn’t advanced any more but she still looked like someone who had just gone through a very bad final’s week at college. She sat half dead eating the food provided for breakfast, a mixture of fish, other sea food and coral which merpeople could eat. Meiko still seemed very thin but she had been eating like crazy and seamed to be gaining weight, she was no longer a step above a walking skeleton or a swimming skeleton now. Her dark hair was becoming fuller and her sun tanned skin was becoming pale again. Her tail seamed to be coming in with a mixture of light rose pink, maroon and unless she was wrong white scales. <br />
<br />
“Morning.” Said Kelly as she and Kenny came down from their little slab, to everyone’s amazement their transformation was closer to being done then those who started sooner. Kenny’s tail was a deep dark reds, maroons and browns. Multiple small fins where clearly visible on his tail and his hands where webbed. His brown hair seamed to become a richer brown and his muscles seamed toner as well. Kelly’s rich chocolate skin seamed clear even as she floated in the water gently flicking her tail which was now filled with a mixture of blues, mostly royal but with dark and sky-blue mixed in. Her dark hair now was tipped with blues. She also had webbed hands and fins on her tail, both looked like a finished merman and mermaid.<br />
<br />
“What happened to you?” inquired Rose as Kelly and Kenny eyed each other and blushed a little.<br />
<br />
“Well lets just say, that Doctor isn’t wrong mer-sex is amazing.” Added Kelly “It may have speed up the change but who cares.”<br />
<br />
“Well…never mind about that we have an idea to escape.” Whispered Taylor</p>
