<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob had pretended to sleep while her kidnappers had made love on the bed next to her. At that stage all she was hoping for was to avoid the attention of Rick. Rick had seemed a big muscular guy when Jacob had been in his own body but now that Jacob was in a female body Rick had seemed a giant.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t remember much before the sex. She guessed the injection Rick had given her had knocked her out. <br />
After the sex session Jacob had listened to the kidnapper’s conversation on the bed while feigning sleep. What had almost startled Jacob into revealing that she was conscious was Jacky’s revelation that Dana was pregnant. Dana’s not wanting to have children had been a major cause of their break-up years ago. (Jacob dismissed the affair he had with another woman as a possible cause). Was that why Dana had returned? To Make Jacob be a father to her baby. Jacob knew that given the chance he would have made a good father. Could he raise a baby that wasn’t his own?<br />
<br />
Those ponderings stopped when the kidnappers got around to talking about what to do about her. Or she assumed they were talking about her. ‘I don&#39;t think we should give him back his real body, I mean too many people running around knowing about the medallion would not be good for your plans’ were the words Jacky had used. That made Jacob scared. Very scared.<br />
<br />
Jacob had then heard the conversation about the need for Jack, Sharon and Jacob to all go to the police so as to clear Rick’s name. She almost volunteered on the spot. She desperately wanted her male body back. But something in the back of her mind made her continue to feign sleep.<br />
<br />
She also heard that Dana had only given the necklace back to Jacky on the proviso that Jacob got his body back. That got Jacob thinking that “Dana still loves me”<br />
<br />
She then heard the story about who Jacky was - A former girlfriend of Jack’s evidently. Jacob could not ever recall meeting her but Jack was quite a ladies man and a lot of different girls had frequented his apartment. Jacob actually owned the apartment Jack rented. That explained why they had gone to Jack’s apartment. <br />
<br />
It was after this point in the conversation that the two kidnappers had left the bedroom. They had closed the bedroom door and Jacob could only hear a muffled conversation from the room outside.  <br />
<br />
Becoming aware that she was alone in the bedroom Jacob slipped quietly out of bed and checked the windows. They were locked. There was no escape that way. Not that Jacob wanted to be outside in the flimsy nightgown that the Jacky woman had made her wear. What would she do if she did escape? Where would she go? And who would possibly believe her story? <br />
<br />
She heard Jacky call out ‘Stop!’ quiet loudly and rushed back into the bed. Did they have a camera trained on her? Were they watching her?<br />
Sometime later the two kidnappers returned to the room. With her eyes closed, pretending to be asleep, Jacob didn’t observe that the two bodies were different. <br />
<br />
Jacob heard and felt the two other bodies squeezing into the bed beside her. It was a queen sized bed but there wasn’t a lot of spare room with 3 adults in it. To Jacob’s horror she sensed a male body was the one lying in the middle.<br />
<br />
Fortunately it seemed the kidnappers were only in the bed to sleep, they were not talking and soon enough Jacob could hear a gently feminine snore from the far side of the bed. Jacob tried to think happy thoughts in order to not think about Rick lying next to her. She could hear his male breathing and smell his body. It wasn’t that he smelt bad. To be honest he actually smelt good, but it was a distinctly male smell and that scared her. <br />
<br />
Jacob’s happy thoughts were about Dana. Had she really given Jacky back the medallion just so Jacob would be returned? She must love him after all. She began to dream about Dana, her gorgeous body, her gorgeous breasts and her beautiful fanny. Jacob prided himself on the way she could make women beg for more. She thought about the effect she had on Sharon the other day. She knew she had essentially blackmailed the woman into the first bout of sex but she had clearly enjoyed her experience and come back for more. She was confident that Dana would also want to hang around now that she had a reminder of what she had been missing.<br />
 <br />
Feigned sleep soon became real sleep and Jacob was unaware when her fingers began to touch her own groin. She soon found her clitoris and began to gently stimulating herself. The fanny her fingers were dipping into quickly became moist. Jacob’s fingers did what they were so good at doing. She was unaware that she had begun to moan.<br />
<br />
The real Sharon now occupying the ‘Jack’ body could not sleep. He was lying on a bed between two women and the thing between his legs had grown to apparently enormous size. Light was shining through the inadequately shaded window revealing the gorgeous Jacky body. He lay there watching her in the semi-darkness. It really was a good body. The girl looked like an angel.<br />
<br />
He turned over and looked at Rick lying on his other side, in the “Sharon” body. It was hard to believe that this attractive woman was really the ultra macho Rick. Rick, clearly embarrassed to find himself in a female body was sleeping in the nightgown Sharon (When Jacky) had bought for herself that afternoon once it became clear that they could not return to their house. Now Ricks breasts were pushing tightly against the flimsy material of the garment, a couple of sizes too small for the body she now occupied.<br />
Much to Sharon’s disappointment, Rick had made it clear that she was not interested in experiencing sex as a woman. Sharon on the other hand would only have been too happy to experience what being the penetrator was like. It was so frustrating that he had this magnificent appendage between his legs but couldn’t use it. He ignored the temptation to snuggle up to Rick and push his rod into her soft body. It was hard to resist, however he knew that he eventually wanted to be back in the Jacky body and in 12 hours Rick would be the man in the relationship once more. It was certainly in his best interests not to upset Rick.<br />
<br />
That was when Sharon heard a very feminine moan coming from his other side. He quietly rolled over to face Jacob. She was also wearing a cheap nightgown, this one sized for the “Sharon” body before Jacob had been changed into “Jacky”. Jacob was lying on her back with one hand cupping her right breast and the other apparently at work on her vulva. <br />
<br />
Seeing this gorgeous female body, in the throws of sexual pleasure was too much for Sharon. He found himself whipping off Rick’s boxers, which was all he had been wearing, before moving on top of Jacob and putting his penis into the very moist hole in her groin.<br />
<br />
Jacob woke in shock to see his friend Jack on top of her and doing something that felt very pleasurable. Before she could scream a hand was placed over her mouth and Jack said ‘Shh keep quiet. You don’t want to wake Rick’</p>
