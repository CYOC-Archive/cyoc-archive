<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan stood in the nude in the transformation chamber, the doctor had inserted the transformation. She tried to keep her heart beat normal and her breathing the steady and felt as if she was failing badly, she had spend years swimming and thought it would help keep herself steady. If failed, her heart rate shot up and her breathing quickened and her body began to shake a bit. <br />
<br />
Mike watched on as the transformation began, his wife was the most beautiful woman he knew and he loved her with all his heart and soul. Even so he had to admit that she like him while aging very well where getting older, they where both closer to 50 then they where to 40. Throw five kids, including two sets of twins had effects on her body. She had kept herself amazing fit, she was the head swim coach and one of the track coaches for their local high school. To be honest he hadn’t been as good either, the six pack he had when he finished basic for the army almost 30 years ago was gone but he didn’t have a beer belly and he was a reserve officer on the Police Department Swat team. So he was fit and strong and could run in full tactical gear but he was getting up in years.<br />
<br />
Before his eyes, his wife began to change. Her body grew slightly taller, she was already tall for a woman but now she had to have added at least an inch or two. While she grew the years seamed to melt away from her. Her breasts never that big but perfect for her frame which had dropped a bit in the years lifted up and became perky again, her ass lifted up as well. The stretch marks around her stomach which where there because of the five beautiful children she had given him disappeared and her skin smoothed out. For a moment it was if he was looking at a slightly taller version his wife in her mid-twenties almost right before she told him that he was going to be a father. <br />
 <br />
For Susan, she felt the years melt away all the little pains she felt in her body disappeared. She felt her breast lift as well as her ass. She looked away from the stunned look on her husband’s face to the mirror along the wall. It was as if she was looking at herself when she was 26 or 27 right before Mary and John where born. Had she really dropped almost half her life in age, she knew that was possible in the change, but she couldn’t believe it. Then she felt one of the worse headaches she had ever felt, and it was focused in two spots. Almost the same spot really on either side of her head. <br />
<br />
Susan winced in pain as Mike watched on as two large lumps formed on either side of her forehead, they where just off center with his wife’s eyes and growing. He watched as they grew and grew, hardening as they grew up, then they curled around before coming to a point. His wife now had horns, ram or possibly goat like horns. The horns hardened with ridges on them and while they where tightly curled some of Susan’s short blondish brown hair was between them. Then that began to change, his wife’s blonde/brown hair which he knew she colored to remove any grey hair began to change into a silver color. Even her eyebrows changed to sliver and he looked down to his wife’s womanhood and saw the hair there was also silver now. While he had been distracted by the hair, he had failed to notice her new horns turning gold or that her ears where now pointed like an elf from a fantasy movie. <br />
<br />
Susan could see her hair turn silver after years of avoiding greys she now had the ultimate grey hair, silver but this silver almost seamed to sparkle like shinned metal. She watched as her chin narrowed a bit and her face narrowed as well, still clearly her but different. Her ears began pointed and she could hear her husband’s breathing as well as her own, she could also smell him, and the smell turned her on. She fought the need to lick her lips as they became fuller and turned from pink to a purple color. She blinked as her eyes changed to purple as well. Then starting at her hair line and moving down her skin changed from white to a dark charcoal color, not black but close. It traveled down her face and her neck which elongated somewhat before spreading out over her shoulders. It paused there for a moment before moving downward. Like an advancing army wherever it touched it changed, her shoulders narrowed a bit as her bust went up at least two cup sizes. She had been a small A cup before but now she had to be a small C cup if not a normal C. Her breasts stayed perky and almost seamed to stand against gravity as the charcoal color advance downward, her sides narrowed a bit but not unnaturally narrow and her hips stayed the same. She felt pain above her ass and then with a wince she felt something pop out.<br />
<br />
Mike could only watch as his wife’s skin turned charcoal color, her bust grew in size. He would never had admitted it to her but he always wished her breasts where bigger and now he was getting that wish. Then out of her tailbone just above her ass which had improved as well, a tail pushed out. It extended like a snake before narrowing to a point. There was no fork or hook at the end just a point. As the changes worked its way down his wife’s legs became even more feminine, however remained for the most part unchanged, expect at the kneecaps, small armored plate formed, almost like a cover over the joint. It like the horns on the top of her head where golden and then her feet changed to the same charcoal color. Her toenails changing to purple the same shade as her lips. He had been so focused on following the advance down he had missed her arms changing to charcoal color as well, similar golden armor plate formed at the elbows and her fingernails turned purple as well even as her hand elongated somewhat.<br />
<br />
For a moment it looked like she was done, Susan looked at herself her new body and she liked it. Then she felt pressure on her back. With a burst two new limbs began to grow from her back as out of her shoulder blades grew two large bat like wings. The main part of the wings were black but at the tip of each a golden claw formed and the membrane which ran between each of the wing tips was a purple color.<br />
<br />
“You are done, I think your a Succubus.” Announced the doctor as Susan, now a charcoal skinned demon with golden horn, silver hair and purple eyes stood there for a moment. She looked at herself and liked it, she felt powerful, felt strong, felt sexy as she eyed her husband. She already wanted to jump him and maybe make another child, she was young again. No she would wait, she wanted to see him as a demon whatever type he would become. There lives would be forever changed by the end of this day for sure, she was only the first to change the rest of her family would come next. <br />
<br />
“Your turn dear husband.” Announced Susan</p>
