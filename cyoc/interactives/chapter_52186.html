<br />
Martha knew her best, only chance of finding a mate was to use the Transform or Dare on <br />
someone before the game was destroyed forever by the combined effort of the catholic <br />
priests and Madam Serenity.  However Martha was no longer a sociopath to non-wolves <br />
like she had been when she was first transformed. Which meant she couldn't bring herself <br />
to grab a random man off the street and use the game on him to transform him, or even <br />
use her dance on a random person even if it was during a moon phase she could use it <br />
because her sense of right and wrong just wouldn't allow it! <br />
<br />
<br />
She could think of a hundred plans to gain herself a partner and/or mate to watch over <br />
the pups... but they all involved the game, and the game in of itself required a level of <br />
sociopathery that none of the pack had anymore. <br />
<br />
Martha, &quot;Why did a random mix of opposing magics have to have the unpredictable side <br />
effect of reproducing the Transform or Dare produced by Miss Harty BEFORE I would think <br />
to find myself a male to help work alongside the pups?&quot; Then again, she -was- Omega, <br />
sex was about the last thing on her priority list. While the pups were at the top of her list. <br />
<br />
At least she had Ameythst who was the pups' tutor and the governess of the gem twins. <br />
Ameythst was a lot smarter than she ever let on, and Zack and Lawrence had both often <br />
questioned if such a 'bubble head' was really the best wolf to teach the next generation. <br />
but Martha had work along side her often enough, though Jensen's pups and Zackery's <br />
didn't interact as often with the gems as often as each other.  None treated the two <br />
headed, three eyed, four breasted, four armed, two tailed shiva like she-wolf as anything <br />
other than beautiful (which artistically Martha knew she was), but Martha had wondered if <br />
Ameythst was simply under equipped for the job. Or maybe Martha felt what anyone felt <br />
at being one of a kind.  <br />
<br />
And still the temptation bubbled up inside Martha, to ask Amethyst to accept a Transform <br />
or Dare to become a mutant like Martha was... She didn't want to FORCE it on, heavens <br />
no, she just prepared not to ask. But she knew once the game was gone, the door would <br />
close forever on that. <br />

&quot;Dear....&quot; Kaylee asked sounding scared as the married couple laid down in the bed, <br />
feeling empty without Fran, Darla and Julie to share it with, &quot;Does this mean we've had <br />
maybe ten years, twenty years of our lives stolen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen reached out, gently touched her muzzle, then pulled her closer to him until her <br />
bodies were against each other, &quot;Be happy you accomplishments, education, experiences, <br />
a legacy, -children- to go along with those years honey... &quot;<br />
<br />
 Jensen felt it, and was sure Kaylee felt it too. Jensen felt his memories of being a self <br />
centered cheerleader dissolving into the ether, while Kaylee felt her own memories of <br />
being a social failure also breaking apart into nothing.  Kaylee reached out and gently <br />
touched a scar her husband had gotten in high school over a decade ago when a football <br />
player not looking where he was going crashed into him in the bleachers remembering <br />
the incident clear as crystal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear I'm scared, will we still be us?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We're always 'us' honey,&quot; Jensen stroked her back as Kaylee stroked him. &quot;We haven't <br />
been those -versions- of us since we misused the game on each other... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean we committed murder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! Absolutely not!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... if I looked back at what I did as Kyle as someone else, and I forget having even <br />
doing things as Kyle...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll still be you. And would you want to go back to that life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in a thousand years, I couldn't bear not having you, not having Jenny, Bart, Marcy, <br />
and Kevin... &quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen hugged her, &quot;Then be happy and content my love, that existence is just a shadow <br />
now fading with the morning light.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two drifted back to sleep in each other's arms. <br />
<br />

<br />
Zelipe saw a woman middle aged, a loving wife, in love with the occult, but loving her <br />
husband more, of having a son who Zelipe knew was now his father, of having a mother <br />
who was not Mommy-Pearl.  A woman who had been happy, a woman with a life all her <br />
own. <br />
<br />
A Zelipe remembered this had been his life... Her life. A life with a different mother and <br />
father who had given birth to her and loved her, of an elder sister who was now less than <br />
a stranger to him... If she even still existed at all. <br />
<br />
Zelipe was scared, knowing how much he'd forget, all those experiences, all those <br />
wonderful memories of being with her husband Randy... all just, gone? Never were?  <br />
Zelipe cried. Not caring that was something only girls were supposed to do or what Bart <br />
would think of him for it. <br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't fair.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No it isn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zelipe blinked at tears, &quot;Alice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... &quot; Said the blond wolf girl wearing a black and red dress with funny shapes on it. &quot;My <br />
name is Marie... I'm... I guess you could say I'm the Game Master now... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then fix it!&quot; Zelipe snapped.<br />
<br />
Marie shook her head. Just yesterday she'd have responded in exactly the same tone, a <br />
little boy angry at the world for stealing things it had no right taking. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, it has to be this way. If reality doesn't heal itself, the chaos left in the world <br />
when Kurse tore the opening to the infinite chaos will eventually existence to fall apart on <br />
itself... Reality is fixing itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pale pink Zelipe blinked in confusion, &quot;It's making sure it can't have kittens?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie blinked back and said, &quot;No I mean it's working to compensate for the changes made <br />
due to chaos being introduced to the universe via the curse. Right now it's feeling the <br />
waters, patching up the obvious changes like the switches in parenthood between you and <br />
your father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I had a father!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, now he's Zack's father... your sister is even worse off, she doesn't even have <br />
her parents in the previous reality as grandparents... &quot;<br />
<br />
Zelipe started, he hadn't even thought about Amy. His sister had become so strange since <br />
their transformation into the pack... or had she always been a little bit off in her own <br />
world like Miss Amethyst? <br />
<br />
&quot;Reality changes, as a rule, take the path of least resistance. This isn't some 'delusion' or <br />
'lie' where reality 'thinks' you're Zelipe of the Big Bad wolf pack. Reality knows you are <br />
Zelipe, and is doing it's best to compensate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... then LET ME HAVE A TURN AT DA GAME! Let me be Zelda again..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And could you leave your mother Pearl? You father Zack? Your sister Amy? The rest of <br />
the pack? Could you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's.. let's... LET'S CHANGE'EM ALL BACK!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... That's not possible anymore, maybe before Kurse died, maybe, but at this point trying <br />
to reverse the healing reality is doing would only make things worse... it could cause the <br />
wounds to tear open again and let the chaos back in... I'm sorry Zelipe... Any more major <br />
changes to reality with the game could be dangerous since reality is in flux... reality might <br />
just throw up it's hands and forsake us all. We'd be dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zelipe shivered. Still sniffing, &quot;But, it's just so wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My Other Mother wanted to make sure we'd lament for defeat when she fell.... If it's any <br />
consolation, you'll always be with your sister. Your father -does- love you. And if it <br />
means anything, this'll be the last misery in it's three hundred and ten years of life that <br />
the curse will cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... You're pretty...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; <br />
<br />
She hugged Zelipe and stroked his head, &quot;Dream of Harry Potter, dream of Wizard of Oz, <br />
dream of Dungeons and Dragons... let a past that no longer exists fade, let memories of <br />
things that never happened be gone...&quot;<br />
<br />
Fall asleep in the dreamscape, Marie gently put the little boy down and kissed him on the <br />
forehead. &quot;You're cute too.&quot; <br />
<br />
With that Marie left Zelipe's dreamscape, making way to Bart's, Kevin's, and Jenny's. <br />

Gary and Brian laid on the make-shift beds, the medical wing stuffed to capacity. The two <br />
male lions talking about the loss of their mates, and their daughters being short two <br />
mothers. <br />
<br />
Tano asked Moja, no one hearing them, &quot;Why did you tell them that? We have pasts of our <br />
own now. We don't have to pretend we used to be our own mothers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because that's how our mothers died.&quot; Moja said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't have to be!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our mothers had their souls cut into four pieces and died. ... &quot; Moja said sagely, &quot;By <br />
tomorrow we'll... we'll be crying out hearts out like any kids would over the loss of their <br />
parents... Everything in our transform or dare I think will still come to pass but... I don't <br />
think we'll remember it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tano started, &quot;But, but how did we even get to be on the island then! Our mothers would <br />
have never put us in that kind of danger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn't, remember Tano? We only arrived there after the dust settled and saw all the <br />
passengers needed a way home...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tano nodded, feeling the memory taking place of their time, taking place of her memory <br />
of being a stuffed lioness doll with a stitched on bikini, though she had one in her <br />
bedroom along with her sister Sita.  The memory of Tatuli and Neili being a stone and <br />
glass fountain replaced by both of them having an early passion for sculpture that had <br />
overjoyed their mother Elise and their father Brian. <br />
<br />
&quot;So by the time they curse is gone, it'll be as if we always were?&quot; Tano asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, not always? We had been conceived and born some time remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls giggled. Remembering the story of how they had gotten their names from their <br />
parents.  Having been born at nearly the name time, their numbers had been counted off <br />
in swahili as a joke, but one of the work-hands there as went the classic story had <br />
mistaken it for their names, and they had stuck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey kids!&quot; Said Sunny passing between them, &quot;I ... I know you've.. oh I know what <br />
happened but please... your dads need rest so please, give us some room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tano and Moja nodded simply and gathered the rest of their sisters leaving the crowded <br />
medical wing (Nane having proven enough trouble to be removed on her own). <br />
<br />
Mbili and Saba were both thunder struck and had to be held by their sisters as they left, <br />
as the memory flash in their minds of earlier that 'day' of seeing their mothers perfectly <br />
unharmed but empty, lifeless soulless shells after Kurse had torn their mothers spirits <br />
apart. It had been an accident they had seen them at all, though Bobbi wondered if it was <br />
for the better, so the eight girls wouldn't live in a fantasy world thinking their mothers <br />
were okay, though Sasha Rhymm the lioness had wondered if living such a fantasy until <br />
they were old enough to appreciate their loss might have been better. <br />

Amy had been underfoot at the police station all day, doing her best to stay out of the <br />
way. June had torn away from the pack desperately wanting to go get her daughter, and <br />
when she had failed, Zack had tried, but like all the pack and pride who had set foot on <br />
the island, they were in too a mangled and broken state to leave the estate safely (On the <br />
pack's side mostly from the vast collection of broken bones from the crystalized twins and <br />
the gruesome stabbings from the possessed deer herd). <br />
<br />
&quot;How does this sound? The gem wolves had been cast away Marie had found on 'her' <br />
island. Apparently it had belonged to her dearly departed father.&quot; Amy herd the voice <br />
behind her. <br />
<br />
&quot;The twins were already part of the pack, otherwise the pack wouldn't have risked itself so <br />
utterly to rescue them all.&quot; Amy didn't even look at the mirror, &quot;And you've never been to <br />
Glendale, and we've never met.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the chaos trickling through as reality heals itself. The alternative of course is deciding <br />
who fathered and mothered which twins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are four sets of gem twins. Jasper. Topaz. Goldie. And Lazuli. The pack is divided <br />
mostly into four females to one male.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Carnelian? Remember, Coral and Tourmaline were the two pink wolves, not <br />
Carnelian.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amy started, leading up against the mirror behind her, which Marie looked onward. <br />
&quot;CURSE THIS CHAOS! ... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chaos was the curse, just directed towards causing human misery...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know I know but... ugh... It feels that every healing it make another wound opens up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not worried. I know it'll work out in the end. Paul and Father Mike are by now working <br />
around the clock to create enough of the cure to be used on Glendale as a whole... but... <br />
all these fragments of randomness that keep creeping up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scared reality will never fully heal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't allow myself to think that, or everything we've done will be for nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help adjust the flow, the white magic that's how a part of Big Bad Island can help <br />
there... I just hope existence -CAN- work it all out in the end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will... it will... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Want a free ride home? Japan's nice this time of year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Japan was Ami's home. Not mine. Take me to my father, brother and mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright... though I'm not sure if we'll know each other once reality fully heals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't know each other now.&quot; Amy said goodbye to the officers explaining one of the <br />
glass wolves had come to take her home (which was true) and let Marie take her into the <br />
mirror verse. Amy looked down at herself, still dressed in a child sized attire of a Shinto <br />
priestess, with the kanji for 'wolf' or 'okami' (which verbally could mean 'great god' if <br />
'written' different) etched in her clothes. <br />
<br />
Ami silently slipped in the cub's bedroom with Marie's help, past Samantha still sleeping <br />
soundly. She stepped out and was naked again, and laid on the same bed as her brother, <br />
and laid back looking at the ceiling wondering if she'd ever get enough sleep again. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Jacob asked as Trevor came with Serenity holding his hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, he thought he saw his attacker back from the dead... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was it?&quot; Jacob asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, like I said, that person is long gone.&quot; Serenity said perfectly honestly. <br />
<br />
The lioness Marie took hold of her son, patting him on the back saying sweet nothings <br />
while his sister looked on confused and distraught. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay son, mommy's here... &quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity saw the teenager and his girlfriend had already departed for part's unknown, 'All <br />
the better.' She thought simply.</p>
