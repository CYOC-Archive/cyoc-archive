<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Chip specializes in a general outlook on plants, Ray has a more culinary view on them. His family owned a larger farm than Chip’s but he shied away from the botanical lifestyle preferring the kitchen. His family was none too pleased about his decision as he’s the eldest in the current generation. But they soon mellowed out when they realized that Ray has a gift when it comes to cooking. He’d usually go from farm to farm, buying and asking for vegetables for the cuisine he’ll cook. He’ll stop by Chip’s family and order the usual basket of herbs Chip’s family cultivates.<br />
<br />
Chip thought the plant is some strange cuisine flora that he hasn’t read yet. And he hopes that Ray’s input would clarify the matter.<br />
<br />
Chip found Ray by the kitchen doing an inventory of the supplied.<br />
<br />
“Ray, I need your help.”<br />
<br />
“What? But I’m busy checking our rations.”<br />
<br />
“You can ask ISAAC to that for you. Isaac, check the inventory.”<br />
<br />
From the comms panel, a robotic voice said, “Enough for a five-month journey judging by the daily average consumption of the crew.”<br />
<br />
“See?” Chip asked.<br />
<br />
“Awww… You know I like counting the food manually.”<br />
<br />
“I know, but I found something you’ll like even better.”<br />
<br />
Chip grabbed Ray by the wrists and dragged him into the hallway where they nearly bumped into Fenton who’s carrying his crystal globes. <br />
<br />
“Watch where you’re going assholes!” Fenton cursed. <br />
<br />
“Sorry!” Chip replied.<br />
<br />
Inside the Conservatory and in the Fruit Quadrant, Ray immediately saw the yellow-vined covered tree. Judging by his look, he too hasn’t seen a tree like this before. He grabbed one of the vines and smelled it from the tip. <br />
<br />
“Fragrant,” He commented.<br />
<br />
He nipped one of the polyps and chewed on it. The glowing juices splashed around his mouth and squeezed between his teeth. “Tastes like Pine Mangoes,”<br />
<br />
“You sure?” Chip nipped one and he verified that it does taste like the citrusy Pine Mango.<br />
<br />
“I could already think of a few deserts with this thing. Did you splice this tree by yourself?”<br />
<br />
“That’s the thing. I didn’t make this tree. It just magically appeared here. I know it wasn’t here yesterday.”<br />
<br />
“Hahaa- ha-” Ray sarcastically laughed. “I know you’re just fucking with me.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not. Look inside and see.”<br />
<br />
Chip showed Ray the glass bowl at the center of the tree trunk and made him peer to see the beating organ inside. Ray knew that Chip is now telling the truth as Chip is not sophisticated enough to make a creature like this. Let alone grow it in a single day. Next, Chip showed the strange vine that looked like an umbrella. Ray grabbed it by the edges and inspected the outside and inside. The surface is a clear bright yellow, rubbery and faintly glows. It’s not coated with enzymes like pitcher plants. It’s just a rubbery bowl. Ray held it in his hands and placed it on his head.<br />
<br />
“Chip, look at me. I’m like that villain in the movie you’re watching.” Ray said. “I. Am. Your. Father.” He said in a robotic tone. <br />
<br />
“Hardy har. His helmet is black, not yellow. And his name is Garth Raider, which is nearly your name. Now remove that thing. You look stupid.”<br />
<br />
Ray grasped by the seams and tried to pull it out, but it wouldn’t budge. He pulled harder but the thing is wrapped around tight by his temples and forehead.<br />
<br />
“I can’t remove this thing!” Ray screamed. Chip helped on removing the helmet but the hold of the thing is stronger. Ray clawed at the outside surface but the rubbery surface prevents him from doing damage. “Chip! It- It’s sucking me.”<br />
<br />
“Sucking you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes! Oh my god!”<br />
<br />
The yellow glowing polyps turned red and the beating true beat faster and harder. The melancholic hum turned into a gnash of metals upon metals and the vines whipped and turned. It was no tree. This is a creature and it’s eating Ray by his head. Chip pulled Ray by the feet and dragged him outside the overgrowth of vines. He managed to at least get him out but the tentacle on his head is still intact. Chip pulled harder but all his efforts were for naught when the vines came alive and pulled his friend back inside.<br />
<br />
“CHIP! AHH!!!”<br />
<br />
Ray’s body thrashed in the hold of the vines and one moment, his body slouched lifelessly. The tree gurgled and then spat out Ray’s lifeless body on the floor. His eyes are wide open and as white as a sheet of paper. Chip slapped his friend’s body and initiated CPR. There’s heartbeat but he is unresponsive to any stimuli he’s placing on his body. <br />
<br />
“Ray, wake up! Wake up!”<br />
<br />
But he wouldn’t. He couldn’t.<br />
<br />
…<br />
…<br />
…<br />
<br />
“Wake up, please!” Chip cried. He buried his head atop his friend’s lifeless body and hoped everything he ever dreamed that his friend talks again.<br />
<br />
“I’m already awake.” Chip opened his eyes but Ray’s eyes were closed like before. He swore he heard his voice. Was he already going mad? It’s just a few seconds before the damn tree killed his friend and he’s already going insane? <br />
<br />
“Where am I?” Ray’s voice spoke once more. Chip was sure this time that the voice is not coming from Ray’s body. He didn’t take his eyes away from the body and he knew the sound is coming elsewhere.<br />
<br />
“Ray? Where are you?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. That’s why I’m asking you in the first place. But I could see your back from here.”<br />
<br />
Chip turned around and saw the glass globe poking in the tree trunk is not empty anymore. Inside is a glowing orb with the faint face of Ray embedded on its surface. It’s red, bright and vibrating minutely in its glass container.<br />
<br />
“Ray? Is that you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes. Please tell me this is just some elaborate prank you made with Stoney. Tell me I’m strapped in VR or you spiked my drink yesterday. This is just some fever dream you think that’s funny.” <br />
<br />
“No, Ray. This is real. Very real. Look,” Chip dragged Ray’s body and showed it to the glass globe. “It’s your body.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my god, am I dead?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think so. Your body is still breathing.”<br />
<br />
“So if my body is there then where am I? What am I?”<br />
<br />
“This is my hypothesis but, I think the tree sucked your soul and stored you in its trunk.”<br />
<br />
Souls, from its very conception up until today, is still debated in the mystic and scientific community. Scientists said that souls have a weight you can measure by weighing a body before and after death. Some scientists say that’s just gas released during death. Mystics say that gas is the soul. No one is sure whether the soul exists or not. But one thing for sure, this tree is a key to understanding its existence.<br />
<br />
“So you mean, I’m stuck in here?” Ray cried. “I still have dishes to cook and dudes to fuck. Am I going to spend the rest of my life stuck as a tree?”<br />
<br />
“We’ll find a way out of this. Maybe, we can repeat what you did earlier. If the tree could suck you in, maybe it could suck you out as well?”<br />
<br />
“Well, the tree already did its thing. Nothing worse could happen now. Do it.”<br />
<br />
It needed the effort to drag Ray’s body to where the vine is, an even greater effort to keep his body upright so that the vine could reach his head. His body is too stubby and damn heavy. Nevertheless, Chip managed to do it. Like what happened before, the tree grumbled and the glowing lights flickered on and off. Ray’s soul got sucked in by a vortex of energy from the top of his prison, which drained to a tube in the crown of the tree. Chip followed the trail of glowing light from the largest vine where it drained into the very vine strapped around Ray’s head.<br />
<br />
The tree churned and grumbled and spat out Ray’s body like it was nothing. <br />
<br />
As expected, Ray grumbled when Chip shook him awake. When Ray opened his eyes, he was met with the tightest hug from his best friend. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry you had to experience that. It’s all my fault that happened to you. I swear it won’t happen again.”<br />
<br />
“Are you kidding me? I want to do that again! Do you realize how scary and exciting that was?”<br />
<br />
“You nearly died. I still don’t know what this tree is. And you’re begging to do it again? I can’t believe you, dude. And look,” Chip pointed at his wristwatch. “It’s nearly 1600 and shouldn’t you be cooking in the kitchen by now?”<br />
<br />
“Oh shit!. Meet me here after dinner.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, fine.”<br />
<br />
And with that, Ray was gone leaving Chip surrounded by the tree that nearly killed his friend.</p>
