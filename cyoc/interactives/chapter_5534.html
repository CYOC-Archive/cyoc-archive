<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">as the two saw the enormous with blood drunken dick began to grow and get enormous wide. But Coal felt that it wasn't the dick, it was the skin of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;The dick is needeld at the end, Coal. Master you are ranning short of blood. Should I cut the under half off you?? Thank you for the lunch, but it was so a small portion, so have a nice meal before I leave you, I am glade you know that the taste of pure bloody meat is my taste, SOoo!!!&quot; said Xan with an evil smile.<br />
<br />
To this horror Coal began to feel that the dick was moving the blood and his meat must have torn in to the dick. He began to wonder why he hadn't cried and what Xan had said. He begin to think, that it all must be an illusion, since the cock startet to expanded over 10 inches in the wide and length.<br />
<br />
He must had have had a black out was his thought after a while, it was in the middle of the night. There was something, three things had fallen to the ground, a little squilly thing, some sort of bone and a large and heavy body. Than there was a time of darkness, of darkness filled with fire. Yes somthing set his stomach in to fire and was still burning there. Coal had the feeling all of his blood was like fire. That wasn't the concert thing, it began to grow, no he began to grow but not at it seems, his flesh was it, but what Co&aacute;l thought.<br />
<br />
Xan shook his head in horror, yes the master began to awake, but was it his master, it is know only a eunuch, a eunuch with to really big balls. To his dislike something haden't let him to his master, because as he had eaten an innerpart of man which has bounded him, could free himself within an hour, when he eat his master. That would have the consequense that his master would be captured by him, but him .... But then he thought, that it only would be happen if he had eaten the heart of the master when it has fallen to the ground but so ... bad day!!!  But so why is now master becoming red this couldn't be, he had sawn as all the masters blood was torn into the dick. But know there is rolling in front of him in and between him and Coal a large bloody ball of human skin. Yes he could smell it, it was human skin, wonderful, tastefull human skin. He could see the underskin and smell another taste, yes holiness pure goodness not seen in his life since more than a century. As it began to roll to him, was parallysed, that could be, he himself had smelled the pure demonic aura of the dick, of some powerful evil, something so unholly which could only be of the rang of a demonlord. &quot;Arggghhh, Qdyyll AAAAAHHHHHHHHH, FFFIIIRREEEE&quot;<br />
<br />
Coal began to worry what happend to him, but then there was an demonic cry, something that he hadn't heard him in his life. As he opened his eyes he saw an Xan with a leg on fire and a bouncing red ball. &quot;Xan don't play a foul, I thought you liked fire, ha hahah&quot; But where was the pain, the egony, the pleasure hhmm what pleasure. Pleasure from his sacks and his dick, yes his dick was on fire. But rest where is it, where his once proud member was is yet only an inch left, but what balls. Yes the balls are really large, like to two watermelons, watermelons?  Yes they were large melons and why could he then Xan? Before he could have another thought the pleasure had build to an unbelieveable hight.<br />
<br />
&quot;DDDUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMM----------------------DDDDUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM&quot; Heard Xan &quot;Water, water, what nice water, yes red and white water. Thank you Coal your cum and blood tast really good. Coal Coal Coal&quot; He could see Coal lying on the floor his leg spread wide and where the balls and cock would be two mounds of demonic meat. Yes he thought, there was a vagina, a proud and one of the most beautifuls of which Xan as a thousands of year demon could thing. The smell of erotic, nudity and pure sex was filling the air. Xan could see as the dark red demonflesh pulsating in Coal and alter him, his flesh(meat). A loud sound of constant pleasure was ascaping Coals lips as he began to floating. As Xan wanted to go nearer his &quot;master&quot; rushed against a glass. As he lifted it up, he could feel something had cooked it out, it was the glass from which the dick came. To his surprise there was an etiquet on which stood in the language of the angels: &quot;Bound through the HOLY DICK of brave and rightful Herinmaus Augustus Paladin master of the order of bravery and inquistion the last rest of the flesh of the demonlord Lilith, ruler of plane ninth level of hell, The Gard&eacute;n of pleasue.&quot; that couldn't read Xan because he could not read the holy and magical language of heaven, but it was fresh overwritten with the new mode language 'elvin' of the mages <br />
&quot;&gt;All beawer, inactive minor DEMONFELSH, dick, minor imp&lt;<br />
&gt;RESEARCH MATERIAL, for studentsexperiments&lt;<br />
&gt;Stolen from the Highorder of Paladins Pauliten&lt;&quot; On the otherside of the glass stood written into the glass but yet not so good to be read of Xan in old magi<br />
&gt;Attation: to be kept in the Holy Chamber&lt;&quot; <br />
<br />
But there was to much passion the room Xan couldn't concentrate, he have to rubbing his dick. Yees Pleasure filled him as he cum in the glass, then there was fire, hot fire, fire that could only come from hell, from the hottest point, he could feel as the glass was melting and driping onto his cock. Than Xan blacked out!!!<br />
<br />
When Coal awaked, he could only see the complet room in fire. The stone was melting and droped to the ground. In the air was lying the taste of sulver and pure sex. He felt alive as he was born once more. But why was he standing in the air. Then he got a glimpse of himself. In the reflection of the melting glassig stones. He saw a woman with red he red hair and eyes, it was the most erotic and beautiful woman he could ever emagine, but it was beyond that. She had only a single mistake, she was pure demonic and evil on sight but without he could say that she overly and overly human. Where they the pure demons? This was the most demonic creature ever placed a foot in the stonewood but the perfectest human at the same time. He could feel that he could control everypart of his body and his aura. He thought a moment, he could control it, but not change it. Without knowing, but through a memory sparkle of the demons, he thought of the unknown never seen demonlord without knowing it, he thought: never seen never changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, master, master it's too hot, help me help, when you are existing, heere it too much pleasure pleasure for me, AAAUUUUUUUAUAUUAUUUAUUUUUUUU; HEEEEEEEELP&quot; Coal heard Xan's voice. Than he thought a moment, he need something, not he need pleasure, he was hungry very hungry. But he wanted to be a Coal again and the room unchanged. He made a step and was in his unchanged room and Coal again, but there was something changed, a glass was lying on the floor, broken with a water and a demon dick was lying in it, a dick from a minor imp. Lying beside the broken glass was Xan, with his claws rubbing his not existing cock. Coal smiled, he was Coal again, all was the same but there was something a miss, he was hungry and hot very hot in an unknown way.<br />
<br />
Then he began to hear Professor Zyrix from the door: &quot;Coal are you there? The complete floor heard your cry of pain! You haven't answered so we are coming in!!!&quot;&quot;</p>
