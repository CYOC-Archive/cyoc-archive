<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Catching his breath, Sam couldn’t be happier finally being out of that dreaded tent. Remembering the reflection he had saw of the mirror just earlier, Sam gasp as he looked down at his body, patting it down. Realizing nothing has changed, he took a sigh of relief before turning around. Shauna and Sara stood not too far from him, catching their own breaths. Like Sam, their appearance has not seemed to have change at all, or at least not noticeably.<br />
<br />
“Wait… where’s Sandra!?” Sam panics.<br />
<br />
The two little girls looked at each other briefly, before turning back to Sam. “I don’t know… maybe she stay inside the maze?” Shauna suggested.<br />
<br />
Sam felt his face drop, realizing that it would be irresponsible leaving a little 6-year-old girl alone, he knew he had to reenter that horrid maze once more.<br />
<br />
“Alright… you two stay here. I’m going to go look for Sandra really quick!” <br />
<br />
“That no fun!” Shauna pouted, “I want to come too!”<br />
<br />
“NO!” Sam couldn’t help but yell back, thought of the things he saw at the mirror maze still made his spines chill a bit, he knew that place wasn’t normal. “Just… stay put, and don’t talk to strangers… I’ll be right back.”<br />
<br />
With that, Shauna couldn’t help but grumpily cross her arms as she watched her older brother reenter the maze through the exit they just came out of.<br />
<br />
Entering the darkness once more, Sam couldn’t help but tremble a bit. “S-Sandra… where are you!? …we need to leave, now! … Sandra!”<br />
<br />
“I’m right here!” He heard a voice reply near him. Twisting his body around him saw Sandra, the little 6-year-old girl waving at him from a distant.<br />
<br />
Seeing Sandra looking the same as always, Sam couldn’t help but take another sigh of relief. He couldn’t help but chuckle because how worried he was about them changing or something. “Sandra… “ Sam spoke as he headed towards the little girl, “just what are you doing back here in this maze? Come on your friends are waiting for you outsi-“<br />
<br />
THONK<br />
<br />
Sam felt his body hit against something. It was a mirror.<br />
<br />
“What… the…” Sam uttered, he was too focused on Sandra he didn’t notice his own reflection which he walk right into.<br />
<br />
Sam then hears giggling as Sandra began to speak once more. “No silly, behind you!” Sam now focused more than ever realized something different about Sandra’s voice… it was deeper than usual… more… mature. Sam turning his head around slowly couldn’t help but feel his jaw hang loose as he saw who was waiting there behind him.<br />
<br />
It was Sandra, not as the little girl she was supposed to be, but as the adult woman he saw reflected on one of these mirror not too long ago.<br />
<br />
Sam couldn’t process what he was seeing; it had to be another reflection! Sam just to speak, but only incomprehensible noises came out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
“What wrong?” The woman laughed as she began to approach Sam. “Cat got your tongue?”<br />
<br />
Looking at this blonde babe approach him, he felt his eyes following the moving of the suggestive swaying of her hips.<br />
<br />
“S-S-Sandra!? Is that really you!? T-This isn’t real, it’s j-just a reflection… right!?”<br />
<br />
“Reflection?” The woman wonders, “Nope, it’s really me, Sandra!” She smiles as she places one of her hands on Sam’s cheeks.<br />
<br />
It was warm of soft.<br />
<br />
“T-There’s no way!” Sam gasps stumbling back, looking at the beautiful blonde woman looking back at him. Sam felt his body heat up with tension being so close to such a babe. She was a couple inches taller than him now, and her massive breast hung only a few inches away as well. “You’re only supposed to be 6-years-old! How did this happen?”<br />
A grin appeared on Sandra’s face, “I’ll tell you… I’ll tell you exactly how I became a sexy… adult… woman” she finished saying as one of her long shapely legs brushed up against Sam’s, making him gush a bit. “It’s all because I said those magic words.”<br />
<br />
“Magic words?” Sam utter back.<br />
<br />
“Yup” Sandra smiled back. “Well before I tell you that let me start from the beginning. As we were leaving this tent under your command, I felt a desperate need to go back and look at the mirror that made me pretty just one more time. Reaching that mirror I looked up at my reflection with a deep sense of yearning, that’s when I said…” Sandra pauses a bit a she leans towards Sam’s face, “I wish I looked that that” she whispered into his ears.<br />
<br />
Backing up a bit with a smile, Sandra continued her story. “When I said those words, I felt a sensation I never felt before pulsating throughout my body. At first I was terrified, I wanted to run, to scream… but I did not. Watching my reflection I noticed it began to change… it was getting smaller… it was shrinking… it was getting younger” she grinned, “As my reflection began to regress, I felt my own body getting bigger… stronger… and older by the second. At first I didn’t know what to think, but soon knowledge began to pour into my mind, I felt myself understanding more and more as time continued on forward. By now I began to enjoy my growth, embracing it as the warm feeling envelops my body. It was as if I was having a really good stretch that didn’t stop. Looking back at my reflection, I was catching up to it, and for a brief moment we matched, but only briefly as I soon surpassed it!” She giggled. “Looking down at my reflection I knew my dream really was coming true. Before I knew it, I became the grown woman I desired to be, while my reflection was now that of the little girl I used to be. Hearing you coming back, I decided to play a little trick on you to surprise you” Sandra laughed. “And that’s that.”<br />
<br />
Hearing the story, Sam was in disbelief, but knew this was the truth. “Sandra, t-this isn’t right! You need to turn back into a little girl!”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think so Sam” Sandra replied back, “and honestly, I also don’t think you want me to turn back either!” Sandra smirked.<br />
<br />
“W-what? What do you mean?” Sam gasped.<br />
<br />
“Oh come on Sam… I know you been ogling my cleavage ever since you first saw me. I don’t blame you though, boys your age can’t help yourself when dealing with girls my age, it’s kind of cute” Sandra giggles “how about this, I&#39;ll let you give these two a little squeeze?” Sandra then suggest, pressing her own hands against her bosom, making Sam’s eyes widen “they’re so big and hefty now.”<br />
<br />
“S-stop teasing me Sandra” Sam pleaded as he shifted his eyes away, trying to alleviate his carnal desire that were beginning to swell up inside him.<br />
<br />
“I’m not joking Sam” Sandra replied. Before Sam had a chance to react, Sandra moved closer to him once more. Gently touching his arms her soft hands, while her long shapely legs rubbed up against his legs. Sam tilting his head up a bit to match Sandra’s gorgeous face looking back at him. He felt his face flush red as his chest began to heave. Sandra was close enough to kiss, but she did not. “You’re still a little young… but how about I make you a man?” Sandra suggest in a low provocative voice.<br />
<br />
Sam’s felt his eyes widen as his brain slowly began to turn into mush…</p>
