<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Damon…what are you doing?” asked Beverly as she and the rest of his friends stood in the cabin area of the ship and looked back at him standing near the stern of the boat beside Whitney.<br />
<br />
“I am sorry, I am going to accept Whitney’s offer.” announced Damon<br />
<br />
“And become a merman?” inquired Tosh to his best friend, Damon looked down as if in shame before snapping his head back up.<br />
<br />
“No…with luck I will become a mermaid, I am trans and that is why my girlfriend left me.” Announced Damon to his stunned friends. “She could being bi sexual, most so when I was ok with a three way with another guy but she wouldn’t do it with another women or accept that I in my heart is a women.”<br />
<br />
“Damon.” said Tosh not sure what he could say to his best friend, however before he could say anything Damon stepped off the boat and fell into the water.<br />
<br />
The water was warm and gave off a glow as Damon fell into the water. He expected the water to begin the process of transforming him but it didn’t. Instead, as he fell Whitney came swooping down and caught him before he touched the sandy covered sea bed. He found that his body couldn’t move as Whitney took him into her arms and lied him on his lap with her tentacles holding him like a baby, he had never realized just how much larger she was thanks to the length of her tentacles.<br />
<br />
“Receive the gift of breath.” Said Whitney as if she was a priest. She bent over and lifted him toward her lips and gave him a full kiss on the lips. She was breathing into his body and as that happened, he felt slits open on either side of his rib cage. She pulled away leaving a small amount of slava linking the two together for a moment as Damon took a breath of sea water, the water rushing into his mouth and pass his new modified lungs before leaving through the slits on his side. He breathed deep as her tentacles began to rub his body.<br />
<br />
“Receive the gift of a new body.” said Whitney as Damon began to feel his body began to change, it was as if his body was molding clay in her tentacles. He felt her rub his head and out of that came a rush of silky-smooth black hair, which was thick yet smooth as it feel around his face and going down to what would be his shoulder blades. <br />
<br />
That was the first sign that his wish was actually happening, he felt his face soften and his neck elongated a bit as his shoulder’s blades snapped together and his entire frame began to thin. It felt amazing as he felt as the tentacles run down his arms thinning them yet at the same time making them more elegant. His fingernails became perfect like he had gone to a manicure. Then the tentacles worked on his chest, he had always been fit and while he liked his muscles, he gladly traded them for this. He felt some of his muscles turn to fat as they became large soft mounds as his nipples pushed out forming two breasts. <br />
<br />
He was surprised at how big they where but happy, given his frame he expected a solid B cup but he was a solid C, maybe mermaids had larger busts. He was too happy to care, tears where falling down his face, as he felt a tentacle rub his manhood, he let out a moan as it was pushed in and he became a she. <br />
<br />
“Thank you.” Said Damon in a female voice.<br />
<br />
“You are welcome my daughter, but we are not done.” Said Whitney as her tentacles worked on her legs. Her legs were pulled outwards and thinned, until her legs where at least almost three feet longer. The legs where then twisted and merged together into a single large limb, with some flare two fins were pulled out of the flesh.<br />
<br />
The flesh color soon disappeared as the skin hardened and formed a scale pattern which went up to her hips. The scales quickly turned a dark color before becoming a black onyx color which reflected the light given off in the water. <br />
<br />
“Take a look at yourself, my daughter.” Said Whitney as the water above her turned semi solid and as smooth and reflective as glass. She was breathtaking beautiful, long silky-smooth black hair which went down to her new large breast, her dark eyes where beautiful and her face was something models would kill for. Her core was strong and feminine, and her tail was long smooth and a black onyx color which was somehow darker than her hair yet reflective the light with ease.<br />
<br />
“Thank you…” said Damon in a silky-smooth sexy voice. She tried to rise but found she couldn’t.<br />
<br />
“Now to finish the transformation, receive the gift of knowledge my daughter.” Said Whitney as she pulled Damon to her bare breast. Damon didn’t know what was going on yet as soon as her new lips touched Whitney’s bare nipple she began to suckle like a baby, milk…began to come out and she drank it with glee. <br />
<br />
At first Damon was confused then new knowledge began to enter her new mermaid mind, she understood now. It was a kin to a computer download, she receive knowledge about how her new life as a mermaid would work, from basic stuff like how to go to the restroom as a mermaid, to how sex worked as a mermaid and what danger monsters where out in the ocean. She even began to get knowledge on where she was in the world, she even understood her location physically in the world and the role Whitney played. <br />
<br />
There where of course other mermaids and merman in the sea, whole cities and all of them where Whitney’s children and grandchildren and so on. She transformed the humans who arrived and helped them join this new world and in time Damon and her friends hopefully would go out and live their new lives in the sea.<br />
<br />
Whitney pulled away, before bending back down and kissing Damon on her forehead. <br />
<br />
“Welcome to the sea my daughter.” Welcomed Whitney<br />
<br />
“Thank you.” Cried Damon with tears of joy in her eyes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What shall we call you?&quot; inquired Whitney as Damon smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Diana.&quot; said Dianna formally Damon, she wanted to keep a D name and stay close to Damon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Diana.&quot; said Whitney</p>
