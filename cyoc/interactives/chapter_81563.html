<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon went to each family member and made them younger. They all ended up in their 20's even Danny. This <br />
startled Mark and as he began to see him youthen he thought to himself Simon must have made the proper <br />
adjustments and decided to turn Danny back to his original age.<br />
<br />
This of course wasn't his intention. <br />
<br />
He then noticed that he was becoming 21. This wasn't a huge change to Mark but he began to get confused as to <br />
the reason for this change. He picked up the phone and called Simon back.<br />
<br />
Dad! Jay yelled to Simon. It's Mark again. <br />
<br />
I figured he would be calling. He unlocked the door and grabbed the phone from Jay. Seeing Jay for the first <br />
time since the change he realized he did good at making the change. He had a shelf where his pecs were. <br />
Sticking out slimming down to a 32 inch waist. Now he had made one interesting change to his clothing once he <br />
saw Danny's setting. He was standing there in a set of bib overalls. The straps straining to hold over his <br />
massive pecs but this made for his shoulders and arms easy access. The loose fit legs were tight on him as the <br />
tree trunk legs filled them. He had 5 o'clock shadow showing on his Greek god face and although he had a bit <br />
of fur on his chest his back arms and legs were almost smooth.<br />
<br />
He saw Bryan flexing out in the corner looking almost a mirror image of Jay.<br />
<br />
As he grabbed the phone and went back into the room and locked the door he caught a glimpse of himself in the <br />
mirror on the back of the door, paused a moment to admire the now sexy muscle daddy and headed back to the <br />
chronivac.<br />
<br />
Yea Mark what's up.<br />
<br />
What the hell are you doing. Thanks for turning Danny back younger but what are you doing to me. <br />
<br />
You need to learn your lesson. <br />
<br />
Oh great Mark thought to himself. I'm sorry what are you going to do to me. <br />
<br />
You will see.<br />
<br />
Well you did a great job on Danny. That hillbilly muscle guy look is good on him.<br />
<br />
I know you should see Jay and Bryan. <br />
<br />
So is that my punishment becoming one of the pec boys like the rest of the boys?<br />
<br />
Rest of the boys? Oh it isn't just the boys that are muscular. You will be happy to see what I have become <br />
too. But no. You are not going to be a pec boy like them you are going to stay 21 forever. I have stopped the <br />
aging on you. One day aging is 0 days aging for you.<br />
<br />
Well that isn't too bad. I guess always being 21 is a bit of a punishment but I was really scared you were <br />
going to do something like make me a baby again.<br />
<br />
Oh don't worry. You shouldn't be a baby I would never do that to you just come on home and we will talk.<br />
<br />
As Danny and Mark got home Mark saw the muscular family. Jay and Bryan almost looked like twins but they were <br />
a couple years different. Simon was the oldest now at 29 and Danny was 28. All incredibly hansom.<br />
<br />
Mark looked at himself in the mirror and he had the look of the others making them all look like they were <br />
related but he didn't have the build that the others did.<br />
<br />
Come with me Mark, Simon said taking him by the hand. I have someone for you to meet.<br />
<br />
They went into Simon's room and he had Mark stand at the door as it was shut. Now son you know what you did <br />
was wrong and it got out of hand. <br />
<br />
Yes dad Mark said. I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
I know you are sorry but you wont learn if I don't punish you so here is your punishment. Simon was sitting <br />
down in his swivel chair looking like he was about to break it with that muscular body but just as he said <br />
that he was going to have to punish Mark he said now turn around I have a surprise for you. Mark was facing <br />
the mirror thinking that he was going to get a spanking but he saw Simon swivel around and hit enter on the <br />
chronivac. In moments Mark was now in a set of overalls just like the others but this set wasn't the same as <br />
theirs. It was straining at the straps but not because he was a pec boy it was because he was easily two to <br />
three times the weight of any of his brothers. And not a bit was muscle. He was all fat.<br />
<br />
DAD!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Oh yea. You get to be the black sheep of the family. And the big punishment is that you get to continue to <br />
know that you are this. I have set my knowledge of the chronivac to full understanding but the boys don't know <br />
anything about it. But they do know that you are to be humiliated by them for being so fat but they wont help <br />
you get buff like them. It is their job to keep you fat. Now get out there and show yourself off to your <br />
brothers.<br />
<br />
No I don't want to.<br />
<br />
I said get out there.<br />
<br />
Mark opened the door and started out the door but his hips had grown so wide that he got stuck in the door and <br />
Simon had to get up and push. <br />
<br />
There were cat calls and hoots as Mark came out the door.<br />
<br />
Simon set the room to have extra locks on the doors and windows so that Mark wouldn't be able to get in and <br />
make any changes to himself and went out and started to play with their now fatboy.<br />
<br />
Mark was easily 450 pounds and they were going to make sure he kept growing fatter.</p>
