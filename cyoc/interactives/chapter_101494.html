<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy felt herself changing.  She was growing taller, and shedding her fairy wings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, &quot; said Amy. &quot;I am not a fairy anymore.  But why?  I didn&#39;t wish for that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mara smiled. &quot;Wishes can be interpreted many ways, child.  That is why it is not wise for one as young as you to use them idly.  Apparently, if I am to be of use to your family and remain your Gryphon, then you must return to your family - as a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how will I make wishes anymore?  And how will I save you?&quot; asked Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a feeling that is no longer required.  I see an exit up ahead.  Come, let&#39;s fly home to your farm, and see what fortune your wish has brought us, &quot; said Mara.<br />
<br />
They exited the cave.  Amy climbed on Mara&#39;s back, and they flew through the air towards Amy&#39;s farm.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
John sat at the kitchen table, idly flipping the lid of the box open and closed with the red button.  He had found it in the cave of that cursed Gryphon.<br />
<br />
That stupid Gryphon!  It had not been at the cave when he brought the hunters.  They were pretty upset.  They didn&#39;t just take back their money.  They gave him a good beating for wasting their time with fairy tales. <br />
<br />
Then he returned home and faced the wrath of their Mom.  Amy was missing, and since he was the older sibling, it was all his fault.  His Mom was now tearfully filling out a missing person report with a police officer.<br />
<br />
John examined the box.  He had hoped to sell whatever was inside.  But instead of something valuable all he found was worthless tubes filled with water.  He held a tube up and examined it.  It had a picture of some animal, and the corresponding name of the animal.  Was this animal urine, or maybe some little kid&#39;s chemistry set?  <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the vial felt very warm.  He dropped it in the box.  The box shook a little, and he felt the lid.  It was warm, too, and felt like it was vibrating.  He was distracted by a bright light out the window. <br />
<br />
He looked out the window, and saw that the light was coming off of the horses.  They glowed brightly, and appeared to be changing.  As he watched, they sprouted wings.  Their snouts changed into beaks, and their hooves became talons and paws.  They were turning into gryphons!<br />
<br />
John ran into the living room.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, Mom! The Gryphons!  They are in the pasture out back!&quot; yelled John.<br />
<br />
His Mom rolled her eyes.  &quot;Of course they are.  Where else would they be?  But it is getting late.  Maybe you should put them in the barn, &quot; said his Mom.<br />
<br />
John couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing.  There were live Gryphons out back, and she didn&#39;t care.  The policeman didn&#39;t even bat an eye. John was so shocked he didn&#39;t hear the policeman&#39;s question.<br />
<br />
His Mom glared at him, and repeated the question loudly and sternly.  &quot;John don&#39;t be rude.  The policeman asked you a question.  Is your sister&#39;s Gryphon out back?  Did she take Mara for a ride?&quot;<br />
<br />
John stared in silence.  How did they know about Amy&#39;s Gryphon?  He had only told the hunters.  &quot;But, Mom.  The Gryphons ....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, the Gryphons, &quot; said his Mom angrily.  &quot;Jeez, John you are acting like you have never seen one before.  But you work with them everyday.  We raise them for God&#39;s sake.  That&#39;s where we live, anyway. On a Gryphon ranch.  Maybe those guys roughed you up a little too much.  Maybe I should take you to a doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
John shook his head. &quot;No, I&#39;m fine.  I&#39;ll go outside and look for Mara.&quot;<br />
<br />
But John didn&#39;t have to go far.  As soon as he opened the door, Mara dropped out of the sky, with Amy on her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young lady, where have you been?&quot; said her Mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mara and I went on an adventure!  I was a fairy, and I saved her from hunters.  But then I wished that Mara could be my gryphon, and that she could help my family.  Then I turned back into a little girl, and Mara flew me home! &quot; said Amy quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my, &quot; said her mother.  &quot;Little girls and their imagination.  I am so sorry for wasting your time, officer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s true!  Tell her, Mara,&quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
Mara opened her mouth and cawed.  She could still speak, thanks to Amy&#39;s magic, but she thought it was a good idea to keep that a secret.  It was better to pretend to be mute like the other Gryphons on the farm, for now.<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s Mom glared at her, then walked the officer out.  As soon as she left, Mara held up one clawed finger to her mouth in a shushing gesture, and winked at Amy.  Amy smiled, and understood that she wanted to keep a secret. The gesture did not go unnoticed by John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, enough fun for one night.  You are grounded for one week.  No more flying!&quot; said Amy&#39;s Mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Mom,&quot; whined Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to try for two weeks.  Now get cleaned up and get into bed.  And you, &quot; said Amy&#39;s Mom, pointing now at John.  &quot; I am not done punishing you yet.  But you can start by putting Mara and the other Gryphons in the stable.&quot;<br />
<br />
John walked outside, leading Mara to the former horse stable.  He felt nervous in the field with all the Gryphons.  They were not like horses.  They looked more vicious, more dangerous, with sharp talons and beady eyes. And Mara seemed to be watching him with almost human intelligence.  Everyone else seemed to accept the Gryphons, but he felt like something was wrong.  Amy&#39;s story was a little too close to what he remembered.  But why was he the only one who remembered?<br />
<br />
After he corralled all the Gryphons, he walked back into the house, vowing to get to the bottom of all this weirdness.</p>
