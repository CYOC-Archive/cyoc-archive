<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carmen’s eyes barely just adjusted to the dark of the room she was deposited into when the chamber suddenly flooded with light. Dozens of bioluminescent bulbs and clusters of coral illuminated a large circular chamber, its naturally cavernous ceiling arching high into a domed hemisphere. Vents in the ground poured out columns reminiscent of smoke into the water. Carmen was naturally headstrong, but even she was a little humbled by the theatrics of it all. <br />
<br />
“Welcome to my fane, Carmen Rodriguez. My sprit allies told me of your coming.” The voice that spoke emerged into the light, and Carmen took a moment to process just what she was seeing. The priestess Livinia was unlike any mermaid she’d seen before. Her hair was stark white airy, like the down of a newborn bird. It fell down over both her shoulders, covering her eyes completely along with much of her face like a veil. Only the enigmatic expression of her black lips conveyed her emotional state. From the neck down, her body was mantled with navy blue scales merging into to a long and sinuous eel like tail. Most striking were blinking white bioluminescent lights that ran down her lower half.<br />
<br />
“I’ve served and advised my darling Tethys for well on three millennia, I’ve done her bidding and safeguarded our peoples’ future in this distant plane, and together we’ve made a home for our kind.” Her lips curled up in a smile. “And you are the first mermaid in all that time, to come to me on her first day as a mermaid, seeking the sacred rite of fertility, an honor granted to but a sixth of our kind in their lifetimes.”<br />
<br />
Carmen began to speak but fell silent as the priestess continued her speech. <br />
<br />
“And yet here you are, found by Tethys’ eye Theodora, and granted leave to meet me by the queen’s own invitation. Why Queen Thethys has ordained this is up to her, but I will abide by her prescience.”<br />
<br />
“I- I just came to get a big dick, and now you’re reciting a lot of prophecy I don’t know what to do with. I promise I didn’t think I’d be wasting your time lady.” Carmen replied.<br />
<br />
“At ease Carmen, you’ve done nothing wrong. But the transformation you’re asking for is not something that is so simple as your guides or Queen Tethys may have made it sound. That was intentional I imagine, to make sure at least one of you came here to try it. You see, the Rite of Fertility is powered by an exceedingly rare and powerful magical reagent, a Seamount Pearl, relics of our ancient battles with the Deep Ones. A single one can power multiple of our most important magical rituals, unfortunately, as I said, you don’t just find these things lying around on the seabed.”<br />
<br />
“And that’s why Chiaki said that only a handful of mermaids have cock.” Carmen answered.<br />
<br />
Carmen snapped her fingers. “Just so. We give it out as often as we can, so we may bolster our numbers, but few are willing to go looking for the pearls, as most are deep in the outer oceans. Queen Tethys normally would not encourage such a reckless venture, but she’s seen something in your group, clearly. So, here’s the deal miss Rodriguez- you get the royal court a pearl, and you get a portion of its power to give you what you’re asking for. One ritual, whatever you desire. You will need training, so will your friends. This won’t happen overnight, and I expect you’ll have many other adventures on the way.”<br />
<br />
Carmen looked at her searching for some tell, this all sounded like it was a lot of deception just get her there, but she gathered through it that Livinia was at least bargaining in good faith, whatever hers’ and Tethys’ motives were. “Sounds… pretty kickass actually, but where the hell do we start? You don’t have a lead or a clue or something?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, yes. Fortunately there’s no shortage of ocean to search. Most often they’re to be found in the ruins and trenches, you’ve been told about their dangers already though. Best you build up to it… follow up with your new acquaintance. That’s what I’d do.” Livinia waved her hand. “And with that, you and your pod have a quest. Go, with mine and the ocean’s blessings. <br />
<br />
———-<br />
“A meeting with the high priestess is never less than memorable.” Lady Cassandora said as Carmen emerged from the inner sanctum. “How did it go? Got what you were looking for?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah she’s scary… sexy scary, but still fucking terrifying.” Carmen said. “I asked for her to set me up with a dick, but I didn’t know it was such a rigmarole.” <br />
<br />
“It is indeed! Not for the feint hearted either.” She turned to face Carmen. “I wouldn’t have you leave the temple empty handed though. We can get you inducted into the guard, have you fitted for your spear and armor. There’s a… traditional welcoming embrace to join the sisterhood, if you follow?” Cassandora swam up closer to her, placing a hand on her sculpted shoulder. <br />
<br />
“Let’s fucking do it.” Carmen purred, flashing her sharpened teeth.<br />
<br />
————<br />
Two bodies wrestled for the upper hand in the middle of the royal guard’s dueling net. It was a large circular cage in the heart of the barracks, perfect for training in the three dimensional challenges of a pitched fight underwater. Right now though, it was being used for something far more pleasurable. <br />
<br />
Cassandora’s chest heaved and her hips bucked with vigor and heat, her bronzed skin flush red as her tail grappled with Carmen’s own. For her part, Carmen moaned deep and heartily as her partner’s fingers probed deep into her slit, her strong but deft fingers expertly lavishing ministrations against her inner walls and massaging her erect nub. Cassandora gasped with savage pleasure as the shark mermaid she made love to nibbled along her shoulder and down to her breast. Her teeth at one point managed to break skin, the faint scent of blood driving her into a wilder frenzy of appetite than Carmen had ever experienced.<br />
<br />
About a dozen other members of the royal guard gathered around to bear witness. Among their number, Carmen grinned as she saw a number of them probing their lower lips, and erect shafts emerging from the tails of a few more.<br />
<br />
“The people love you…” Cassandora panted as she dragged her hips sensuously over Carmen’s lap. <br />
<br />
“They’re watching both of us. I can get used to this, you gals know how to make an introduction!” Carmen growled huskily, seizing Cassandora’s long braid of copper hair, giving it a tug that made the commander yip in excitement. <br />
<br />
“You’re fierce, let’s hope you fight like you fuck.” Cassandora moaned. Her fingers withdrew from Carmen, leaving her right at the edge. “You have one last task though, taste of your commander, and join our ranks in full.” The commander held firm to her shoulders and pushed Carmen down to her ready slit. <br />
<br />
Their commander shuddered in a powerful orgasm as Carmen’s tongue ate her out. The taste of mermaid’s fluids, ambrosial and pleasantly salty, flooded into her lips as she drank up voraciously. Her caramel skin flushed red from cheek all the way down <br />
 her neck and shoulders as Carmen rewarded her recruit, brushing her sensitive slit with her tailfin just gently and pleasurably enough to grace her with the climax she was initially denied. <br />
<br />
The two mermaid floated to the bottom of the arena, gearing up for another round as the rest of the guard slipped into the ring.<br />
<br />
“The intimation’s over, so it’s  open season now. Have fun, recruit Carmen.” Cassandora caressed her lover’s chest sensually, before promptly slapping her on the ass and propelling them up into the frenzy of mating mermaids.</p>
