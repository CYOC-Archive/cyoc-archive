<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The arrival in Rio De Janeiro was fairly quiet and the team from Janace had little real expectation of what would going on there. The previous outbreaks had widespread sex as lust filled Kats went around trying to satisfy it and thus spread the virus. Paris and Cairo had been noted by violent actions that went towards trying to spread the virus when the Kats began to turn to loving each other and not spreading the virus, as what had largely happened in Fee City. The only incident that had been different had been the strange calm in Sydney. There there was no violence and no wild lust, and in fact the people that became Kats there quickly volunteered to help with the vaccinations so that they wouldn&#39;t spread it further in the city, but that in itself presented the team with various things they needed to ponder.<br />
<br />
The issue the team had to solve was the terrorist Li Sang. The man had engaged in a great many different crimes over various years and had been good at avoiding capture by law enforcement. At one point they&#39;d thought they&#39;d captured and killed him, for piracy, but when Sammy had identified him as hir kidnapper, it was clear that the man the Chinese had executed had been either a double deliberately sent to die or a lookalike who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. All of this demonstrated a great deal of criminal intelligence and hinted at a much larger scheme that wasn&#39;t just being carried out by Li Sang himself. Regardless of what had been the original genetic template for the Chakat Virus, be it Talia&#39;s blood or an extremely complex design the result from modern genetic engineering, a pirate and a terrorist could never organize anything like this on his own. He had to have support somewhere.<br />
<br />
And something that sat in the back of Raul&#39;s mind, a legacy of his time as a general, was the question of what Li Sang&#39;s goal was. While the Kats once they&#39;d gotten their &quot;mind&#39;s back&quot; time and time again proved that they&#39;d rather love each other and have sex than do anything violent, they were still immensely powerful creatures. While Kats were not brawny creatures built for combat, the fact that their taur halves were still the size of a big cat gave them a tremendous amount of power and that a normal human would need some weapon in order to take a Kat on if the Kat was determined to fight, for whatever reason. In addition, Kats, due to having the head of the animals their Kat form was based on, their sense of smell and hearing was greater than any normal human&#39;s. By creating so many Kats, Li Sang was creating an army that would be able to more accurately track him, and given his criminal record, it was doubtful that ending war was something on his mind.<br />
<br />
They were met by a lone man who represented local police units.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the team from the UN?&quot; the Brazilian policeman asked, in English, though with a heavy accent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Raul said slowly, &quot;I am Raul Heroud, these are Ryles, Talia, Midnight, Luna, and Lia. We&#39;re here to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m afraid you don&#39;t have a very simple case,&quot; the policeman answered, &quot;while the effects of the Vaccine Bomb that you released about a month ago are spreading... it&#39;s effects in the Southern Hemisphere has been limited... or so the news say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what does that mean?&quot; Ryles asked slowly and sounding rather curious and still adapting to the fact that shi suddenly had the same mental faculties and abilities that humans had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, according to the news, the Vaccine Bomb was released in the Northern Hemisphere and is spread by the NORTHERN jet stream,&quot; the policeman answered, &quot;We are presently in the Southern Hemisphere and has its own jet stream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we could unleash a second one,&quot; Ryles came up with the solution.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d need to work with the government of Chili for that... or maybe Peru... looking for the high point you could use to get it into the southern jet stream,&quot; the policeman nodded, &quot;In the meantime... there are plenty of things here in Rio De Janeiro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lust filled and aggressive Kats?&quot; Raul surmised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not entirely,&quot; the policeman explained and began to lead them towards a large van, &quot;Some might be... but since the number of people with the vaccine is growing larger... not everyone is transforming after the &quot;attack&quot; and there the real trouble is that the Kats then go into a strange sort of panic... they declare their love for the one they&#39;ve &quot;attacked&quot; and then seem to panic when their &quot;mate&quot; doesn&#39;t change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Luna sighed, &quot;we got some horny Kats out there that are now panicking because they can&#39;t just create new mates...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That should make giving them the Foxkat Vaccine fairly easy,&quot; Talia commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if they&#39;re panicking,&quot; Raul warned, &quot;They could lash out more aggressively and since we aren&#39;t here to kill them, we can&#39;t respond in kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia only shrugged. Much of this was the standard sort of problem they faced in previous outbreaks. The fact that some were panicking was new, but providing some comfort for them shouldn&#39;t be too hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;What sort of Kats are we facing?&quot; Lia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most are actually birds... based on parrots, parakeets, toucans, and various song birds, some are not always from Brazil, but there are the various Chakats, most of them being based off of Jaguars,&quot; the policeman answered, &quot;The only other Kat is based off of a Capybara.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Ryles asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Capybara? The world&#39;s largest rodent, though it has no visible tails,&quot; the policeman said slowly.<br />
<br />
Ryles licked hir lips, betraying the fact that shi had been a normal Fennec before Alexis and Flake discovered the vaccine in their system affected normal animals the way the virus affected non-vaccinated humans. Fennec Foxes, like all foxes typically preyed on rodents, though wild Fennec Foxes never encountered rodents the size of the Capybara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, they are still people Ryles,&quot; Luna teased, &quot;If you&#39;re good we can see if we can go hunting later and you can get a real Capybara to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryles wagged hir tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;More Kats that aren&#39;t taurs,&quot; Lia commented on the fact that many of the Kats were based on birds, &quot;It&#39;d be like Sydney all over again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t taurs?&quot; Midnight asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only having two legs,&quot; Luna explained to hir sither.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Midnight commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;The real interesting thing is that we caught the guy who set the bomb off that was supposed to trigger the outbreak,&quot; the policeman commented, &quot;The guy was already vaccinated and was noticed by some one when he was setting up the bomb. We got him in our main station if you want to take custody of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll need to in order to get information Li Sang&#39;s activities,&quot; Raul answered.</p>
