<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen had rummaged around her hotel room that day, and found she was on vacation, she took the chance to take off the bikini, what little it was, and look at herself naked, she was pleased, she had never wanted to be this huge, but it made her feel powerful. She finally got a measurement, she now stood at eight foot two inches tall, she took the time to explore her new self, even enjoying some carnal desire a few times, but now it was time to go home, her vacation was over. She left the hotel and hopped into her car, she found some things translated, she hated flying, and so did her new self.<br />
<br />
It took a few days to go home, but she found herself enjoying her new body more and more, people stopped and would do a double take at the new goddess, she would go over to them and have a lengthy conversation, her anxiety about the situation had changed as she continued on her cross country trip. There was one thought on her mind though, what would she do to Kyle when she found him, but as she continued on her trip she found herself wanted less vengeance on him and more wanting to reward him. She was gorgeous, wealthy and popular, and she had him to thank for it, so she planned as she went.<br />
<br />
Jen got home, and called her parents, having a long a wonderful talk with them, and she got herself familiar with her new house and land, she found she had a bit of a cowgirl attitude now, and while that struck the former cheerleader off guard, she found it to be more interesting. Jen got back to her business and continued to think about Kyle, and what she would reward him with, she finally decided on what to do two weeks after she got home and went to the school, assuming she had changed and he had not, sure enough she found him walking alone to school and walked up behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle.&quot; Jen said in her breathiest, sexiest voice. Kyle turned around and shrieked in surprise &quot;JEN!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, It&#39;s me, do you like it, I sure do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle stared at the enormous woman, he couldn&#39;t even compute how his vengeance had backfired this badly, he wanted her to suffer and be some fat guy or and animal, and here she was, twice as sexy and she could beat the hell out of him if she wanted to. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got a question for you Kyle, Transform or Dare.&quot; Jen said with a sly smile. Kyle couldn&#39;t even think of a response, he stewed in his anger as time ran out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it looks like you&#39;re out of time, so you get both. For your transformation, you&#39;ll age to be twenty six, two year younger than I am now, but you won&#39;t grow too much taller, in fact you&#39;ll stay the same height...&quot; Kyle wanted to scream &quot;...but your cock will grow to be able to satisfy me as I am now.&quot; Kyle blushed in anger as he felt his body age, he finally grew the beard he had wanted, but it didn&#39;t help that she was now towering over him like this, and would do so forever, thoughts and memories fell into his mind, he is a computer programmer now, but still single, despite what was happening down in his pants right now, he looked down, his stiff member stuffed into his pant leg, it reached down to his knee. He looked at her with loathing, but she reached down and touched him, abruptly sending mixed signals through his body. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s better, much, much better. You know Kyle, I could have beat you half to death, or turned you into a monkey or something like that. But I&#39;m going to reward you for this...&quot; The ran her hands up and down her body, &quot;...for your dare, you will start packing all of your things from your house and move into mine, and never use the curse again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT? WHY WOULD I DO THAT YOU BITCH?&quot; Kyle yelled. Jen leaned in really close, Kyle blushed in anger and arousal as he couldn&#39;t get his eyes off her massive bust, she brought her lips close to his ear and she whispered to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you&#39;re mine now little man, you get to fuck a goddess from now on. Now don&#39;t argue with me, you&#39;re under a dare now.&quot; Kyle&#39;s eyes went wide, he couldn&#39;t find anything to say as she walked past him a little, turned around and slapped his ass, making him cum down his jeans. Jen enjoyed the look of shock on his face.</p>
