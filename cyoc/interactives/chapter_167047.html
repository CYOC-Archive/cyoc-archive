<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janet&#39;s eyes grew bigger as she surveyed her massive husband panting above her, his swollen muscular chest heaving in and out as he peeked over the mounds of muscle that made up his pecs.<br />
&quot;WHAT the FUCK is going on?!&quot; Janet exclaimed while propping herself up on her elbows still breathing heavily from the intense intercourse the pair had just had.<br />
&quot;I TRIED to explain earlier,&quot; Matt began, gesturing with his over-stuffed arms, &quot;but you decided to have your way with me.&quot;<br />
Matt smiled and winked at her as he said this last bit.<br />
<br />
Janet smiled back, &quot;Well, now&#39;s as good of time as ever, because good lord, you are enormous and this doesn&#39;t make sense!&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe we should put on some clothes first, you seem a little distracted,&quot; Matt replied noticing that Janet was not looking at his face, but instead was starting at his huge mounded body.  To Janet, Matt appeared to be just a series of muscular globes, with deep valleys and tight crevices separating each lightly tanned sphere.<br />
&quot;HEY, my eyes are up here!&quot; Matt joked as he tried to bring his index fingers to point to his eyes, but his watermelon shoulders and ham-sized arms collided with his beachball pecs rendering the distance between his fingers and his eyes over a foot apart.<br />
<br />
Janet shook her head and laughed as she looked up at him and said, &quot;you&#39;re right!  I&#39;m sorry, I just can&#39;t believe this!&quot;<br />
&quot;You and be both, babe...&quot; Matt trailed off as he turned naked to dig through his dresser for something that might fit him, realizing now that his options would be severely limited now that he clocked in around 445 pounds, a good 245 pounds over the limits of his wardrobe.  Meanwhile, Janet bounced off the bed, never taking her eyes off her husband&#39;s massive form, noticing the expansive acreage of his muscled back and ass.  His backside seemed almost like a square sitting atop two monster truck tire piles that made up his immense hamstrings and calves.  He sported an incredibly wide, nearly 4-foot expanse shoulder-span with giant lats and traps that obscured his ears.  There was some taper to his waist, but not much as his huge roidgut on the other side forced his waist to be significantly wider than the average bodybuilder&#39;s.  His bubbled ass was sticking out far past his back and nearly formed a shelf as it bowed outwards both directly behind him and to the sides.  His hamstrings were immense as well, jutting out from the back of his legs and inflating into wide and powerful ellipses before cutting into his knees and then blowing back out again into his overstuffed bowling ball calves.<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s mouth continued watering as she pulled on a pair of panties and a skimpy pair of jammie shorts.  She pulled a close-fitting tank top on over her bra and perched on the bed as the still-naked Matt pulled items from his dresser searching for something that would cover his bulk.<br />
&quot;Need some help??&quot; Janet asked stifling a giggle.<br />
&quot;Uhh... yeah... haha,&quot; Matt replied as he realized he was struggling to bend over and reach the lower drawers of the dresser, &quot;although I don&#39;t know if I have anything that will fit this body.&quot; Matt again gestured to his overinflated physique rubbing his hands down from his pecs and over his blown out abs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about those old sweatpants shorts my mom got you a couple years ago?  The ones that were way too big and we forgot to return?&quot;  Janet offered as she opened the bottom drawer and dug to the bottom, pulling out a huge pair of shorts made from sweatpants material.  She then dug from the same drawer an oversized white t-shirt displaying the logo of the local baseball team.  The shirt&#39;s tag read XXXL.  &quot;Why the hell do they put such huge t-shirts in those stupid shirt canons at the games??&quot; Janet asked looking at the shirt, &quot;well, I suppose it worked out for you now... Hopefully it will fit!&quot;<br />
<br />
She handed the shorts and t-shirt up to Matt, again eyeing his monstrous body.  She realized from her position, she couldn&#39;t see Matt&#39;s face over his titanic torso.  Matt took the the shorts first and began bending over to slip them on.  Instantly, the problem presented himself.  His gut collided with his giant quads and stopped him short from reaching the ground by a couple feet.  He couldn&#39;t lift his legs any to step into the shorts.<br />
&quot;uhh, I guess I didn&#39;t think this through either,&quot; Matt chuckled.<br />
Janet practically came in her new panties as she watched the immense pile of meat try and maneuver into his shorts, &quot;here, let me help you!&quot; Janet said, as she grabbed the shorts and held them open near the floor as Matt, not able to see what he was doing, slipped first one foot, then the other into the shorts.  Janet hiked them up pulling them every which way as they worked their way over Matt&#39;s redwood-sized legs.  She pulled and yanked as she tried to stretch the waistband larger to work the shorts up and over the bulbous quads and his doubly wide ass, seams and fibers snapping the whole way, and breaking a good sweat, Janet managed to get the shorts to his waist and past his newly enlarged dick hanging in front of her face.  She cinched the waistband a couple inches before it snugged up and stepped back.<br />
<br />
Janet laughed again at the sight of her overgrown husband in the once too-large shorts.  He looked like a child wearing one of those overly large muscle suits boys get for Halloween superhero costumes while also wearing a pair of toddler shorts.  The sweatpants material shorts were painted on his skin, showing off every crevice, every bulge, and stretched grotesquely over his huge ass.  The shorts were designed to hang right at the knee, but on Matt they were pulled taut halfway down his quads.<br />
<br />
Matt was frustrated, but smiled, &quot;Jeeze, this is taking forever!  Lets get this tent of a shirt on and I will explain it all!&quot;  Matt held out this shirt in front of him and tossed it over his head.  He managed in getting his head through the hole but wasn&#39;t able to go further.  His arms were simply too big to reach up and pull them through the holes, as the material kept getting snagged on this mound of muscle here, this watermelon shoulder there.  Janet reached up and guided first one nearly 3-foot diameter bicep thorough an arm hole, then the other, popping seams the whole way.  She then pulled the shirt down over his gargantuan pecs and gut.<br />
<br />
Janet stepped back and admired her work.  He was dressed, but only barely.  Everything was very tight, showing off his body and not really helping her lust at all.   Matt turned and looked in the mirror, shrugged and maneuvered his way over to bed, lowering himself down onto it breathing heavily.  The bed took his weight, but groaned loudly in protest.<br />
<br />
Janet stood, hands on her hips and said, &quot;alright, spill it.  What the hell is going on with this body of yours??&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt looked up at her and told her the whole story of going over to Cray&#39;s house, seeing the nearly immobile forms of Guy and Cray, how they had forced the ointment on him, and how the ointment&#39;s properties made the user grow to their subconsciously desired size, how he had seen Guy and Cray and thought how great it would be to have such a powerful body, and had grown immobile himself under piles of muscle.  How he had overcome that brief desire and been able to move again, before making his way home and further shrinking himself to a more reasonable form before she, Janet, had shown up and seen him.  He then went on to explain his discovery of about 20 minutes earlier when he realized that Janet was controlling his body using the ointment&#39;s properties.  That she must have desired him to be bigger, the size he was now, while they were having sex and thus growing him into this 445 pound pile of flesh.<br />
<br />
Janet listened intently, and as difficult and ludicrous as it all sounded, she couldn&#39;t deny it must be true, given the size of her beast of a husband telling her the tale while popping seams on a XXXL shirt and stuffed into XXL shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me get this straight,&quot; Janet said, pacing the floor, &quot;this ointment that Guy picked up...all you have to do is imagine your body a certain way, and it just happens??  And that somehow, I am able to do the same thing to your body since you used the ointment?&quot;<br />
&quot;As far as I can tell, yeah.&quot; Matt replied shrugging his 4-foot shoulders.<br />
&quot;And Guy and Cray were nearly immobile when you saw them, and you actually grew so much muscle that you were unable to move?!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.....&quot; Matt replied suddenly eyeing his wife, &quot;why?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s almost too much to believe, Matt, it&#39;s impossible to grow that size in the real world!&quot; Janet said absently glancing down at her husband sitting on the bed as she paced the room.&quot;<br />
&quot;Jan...Be careful what you&#39;re thinking about... You never know what can set off the gr...&quot; Matt began, when he suddenly heard more seams popping on his shirt and shorts, and felt his whole body stiffen.<br />
&quot;JANET!  STOP!  You&#39;re causing it to happen again!  I&#39;m already too big.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh Matt, I&#39;m sorry!  I can&#39;t help it!  Janet said exasperated, turning to face him, &quot;but you said we can shrink you down again, right?!  Please!  I just want to see what this looks like.  I do love my man with more meat on him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s mouth dropped open, his chin nearly hitting his pecs.  He couldn&#39;t believe his wife was so ok with this situation.  Internally, he admitted he was terrified of the effect his ability to change his body&#39;s size would have on his wife, and had been overcome with emotion at Cray&#39;s house over it.  But seeing his wife so excited to experiment on this phenomenon was more than a little hot.  He smiled up at her, again feeling the sensation of tensing muscles and hearing more seams popping and a couple of tears on the sides of his shorts.<br />
&quot;Alright... have your way with me, hot mama.&quot; Matt said gazing up at her.<br />
<br />
Janet squealed with delight as she imagined her handsome husband growing immense, huge, too big to move under his piles and mounds of muscle.  She watched his body and looked lovingly into his eyes as his body puffed and reshaped itself into an even greater form.<br />
<br />
First, Matt felt his quads pressing even harder into each other, pushing his legs apart on the bed.  The sweatpants shorts creeped higher on his monstrous legs, before starting to rip open down the sides.  His calves touched briefly as they swelled larger, but in the end, his quads were simply too enormous and pushed his legs apart too much to touch anymore.  He stared up smiling at his wife as his ass swelled and bubbled outwards into a butt Kim K. would be in awe of.  The huge ass pulled the shorts tightly backwards and accentuated his well-endowed member in the dark blue fabric of the shorts.  This didn&#39;t last long, however, as he was slowly becoming aroused watching his wife get hot just watching him grow.  <br />
&quot;I want to be a part of this!&quot; Janet exclaimed, as she hopped onto Matt&#39;s immense lap and pushed him back on the bed as she straddled his waist.  At this point, his expanding waist snapped the waistband of the shorts with a &#39;BANG!&#39; slapping Janet in the shins on it&#39;s way off Matt&#39;s body.  &quot;Ouch!&quot; Janet yipped.<br />
Meanwhile, the combination of his arousal, the pressure of his growing ass and legs on the shorts  caused the the seams of the shorts to give way in short order, ripping in multiple spots as his lower half swelled in size.  By the time this all happened, Matt&#39;s hamstrings inflated to the point that they made contact with this billowing calves, effectively rendering his knee movements to almost nothing.<br />
<br />
During all this, his top half was also responding to Janet&#39;s imaginative subconscious.  His biceps and triceps blew up fast and in beautiful fashion as they crisscrossed with veins and grew beyond the size of most bodybuilder&#39;s two quads combined.  They swelled in size to over 4 feet in diameter.  His forearms swelling in time, and eventually overtaking his elbows and locking his arms in.<br />
<br />
Janet wasted no time in feeling every part of Matt&#39;s body she could reach, running her soft hands all over his arms, growing pecs, lats, and traps, and kissing him intensely on his rock hard, southerly-pointing nipples, and tracing every perfect ab muscle.  She felt Matt&#39;s dick slapping her back the whole time she watched as Matt outgrew the oversize shirt he was wearing.  The white shirt was practically see-through by this point as Matt pumped larger and larger.  It pulled upwards as Matt&#39;s pecs swelled and puffed with each heavy breath he took.  By the time Matt&#39;s pecs brushed his chin, the shirt and ridden up to his 3rd row of bowed out abs.  Janet was practically doing the splits across his enormous waist as Matt lay prone on the creaking bed.<br />
<br />
CRASH!!  the bed fell to the floor under Matt&#39;s considerable weight.  He continued to swell in all directions as Janet surveyed the immense body beneath her.  The shirt was finally giving way as the the armpits ripped open at the same time as the neckline.  It split almost down the middle as his lightly tanned swelling flesh made itself known to the world, with a deep canyon between a pair of pecs that pressed heavily into each other.  His abs mounded up to meet the two king-sized pillow pecs.  Matt&#39;s obliques and abs fought for space on his torso as they pushed outwards in all directions, pushing Janet back against Matt&#39;s cock.  Matt&#39;s shoulders finished off the shirt as they burst through the top portion of the shirt and pressed against his traps as they buried his ears.  Matt closed his eyes and this time enjoyed the sensation, as for the second time that day, he felt his mobility disappearing beneath his titanic body.  His lats swelled up a few inches bigger as they pushed his arms up and locked them in place.  His monstrous muscle belly pushed hard against his pecs and made bending over impossible.  He groaned as his inflexibility caused slight pain as his sewer pipe-sized legs pressed hard into one another and caused his legs to spread beyond what he thought possible.  His massive waistline, still straddled by his tiny wife, met with his gargantuan quads and gut, and made twisting almost impossible.<br />
<br />
Matt lay there heaving breath in and out as he looked up at the ceiling, able to feel the hundreds of pounds of flesh piled on his body tensing and flexing.  All he could see was several square feet of his chest sticking up into the air in front of him, as his head was held aloft by his monstrosity of a back, the muscles there all overinflated and overstuffed like a giant couch.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Janet&#39;s face appeared at the top of of his chest as she peered down at him from several feet up.<br />
&quot;Wow, babe, I didn&#39;t know you had an imagination like this!&quot; Matt breathed heavily<br />
&quot;This...is...so...fucking...hot.&quot;  Janet replied gazing down at him and doing flesh-angels across his chest and gut, moving her arms in circular motions across the mounds of flesh below her.  <br />
<br />
Matt was fully erect at this point, and Janet slowly slid herself backwards, up and over Matt&#39;s gut, and down near the throbbing cock.  She toyed with it for a while before taking the whole thing in her mouth and sucking her husband off.  <br />
<br />
Matt howled in pleasure and would have arched his back and gripped the sheets if he had been able to move anything.  Since he could do neither, he tensed every muscle, swelling them slightly larger as he enjoyed the sensations, breathing hard.<br />
<br />
When Janet was done, she slipped off Matt and the bed, and walked around his monstrous prone form on the bed, and spreading across the floor.  She mounted his bicep and climbed over making her way around to his tiny head nearly lost among the mounds of muscle making up his torso and arms.<br />
&quot;Hi honey, my own personal planet.  Janet&#39;s Planet!&quot; Janet said smiling, bending over and looking down at Matt&#39;s face from upside down.  Matt opened his eyes and gazed up at his wife, taking in her face and body.  He couldn&#39;t believe he was so lucky.<br />
Janet reached down and stroked Matt&#39;s hair with her left hand while her right reached up and traced the striations of his enormous right pec and shoulder.<br />
&quot;Now...what...?&quot; Matt panted.</p>
