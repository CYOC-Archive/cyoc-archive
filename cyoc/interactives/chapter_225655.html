<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nancy enjoyed hanging out with Charles throughout the day. The way people reacted to his imposing figure, how he managed to get the girl&#39;s (and a few boys&#39;) attention by just being in the room, and wherever they went, people listened to him. And to top it all off, whenever someone tried to approach him to see if he was available, he would say that he was “taken” and walk away with Nancy following along. Of course, nobody would ever know that Charles, the big, hunk of man meat, was once Charlotte, a lithe girl who has nanomachines floating in their body.<br />
<br />
Nearing the end of their celebration, the young couple decided to end the night by partying at the nearby club. With Charles dressed up in his recently bought blazer-sweater combo and upper-end jeans to go with it, he dominated the dance floor. Nancy, who was quite proud of her nanobots that caused these newfound changes in her “boyfriend”, just sat by the bar and tapped on her phone to take notes of the day. She was about to take another sip of her wine when she saw the time on her phone.<br />
<br />
“It’s 11:58 already!!”<br />
<br />
Nancy put down her glass and left to find Charles, but not before quickly paying for the drinks that they had. Now, finding Charles wasn’t the hard part. It is the part to pull him away from his adoring “fans” and head home is makes it difficult to do. Nancy squeezed her way between the dancers to get to Charles, with it became harder and harder to do the closer she got due to the gathering that surrounded him. As she barely gets close enough to touch Charles to get his attention, a gaggle of drunken girls surged in the way just before she could reach him.<br />
<br />
“Just what are you doing, bitch?” one of them shouted at Nancy to be heard over the booming music. “Yeah. He’s our, bitch. Go find some other guy, loser.” screeched another as they blocked Nancy away from Charles. “Let me through, he’s my boyfriend!” Nancy yelled to be heard through all of the noises, with Charles unable to hear her due to the club and a girl laying herself on him. <br />
“Like, he would be a boyfriend to a loser like you,” the first girl said to Nancy before she turned back around and shimmied up to Charles. “But he can stay here, he is-” Nancy&#39;s yelling went unheard on the dance floor, with the cacophony blaring out in the room.<br />
<br />
Then Nancy&#39;s phone alarm rang from her pocket, alerting her that it was now midnight.<br />
<br />
Charlotte never knew how easy it was to be a man. Granted, there was a learning curve in the beginning (especially in the bathroom), but he managed to figure it out. And here he is now, being the center of attention at the club with all of these sexy, drunk girls tossing themselves on him the moment he walked through those doors. While the thought of being the one giving instead of taking did cross Charlotte’s mind and doesn’t want to do it, Charles on the other hand is down for anything.<br />
That is until he felt some hair fall across his vision. His hair that he had done up in a man bun. He takes his phone from his pockets, something that Charlotte enjoyed using since she tried on guy clothes, to see what time it is to which he panic! At the disco, where he spent too much time dancing and enjoying being a man among boys, Charles lost track of time and soon be back as Charlotte and then some.<br />
<br />
Charles tried to escape the enclosure of dancers, but the drunk girls weren&#39;t letting him. “Where are you going, stud,” she loudly whispered in Charles&#39;s ear, not noticing that she had to push past some more hair than before to get to his ear. “Yeah, where are you going, handsome?” said the other while she draped herself over his chest, who was too drunk to tell that he was approaching her height. Thinking of the only place where he could get some privacy, Charles quickly said with his voice rising a bit higher, “I need to use the restroom.”<br />
A bit crestfallen about letting such a catch go, the girls let Charles out to relieve himself. But not before saying something that threw a wrench in his plan. “Okay, but we’ll be waiting outside the door to continue to dance the night away. You still owed us at least that.” “I don’t owe you jackshit,” thought Charlotte while she pushed her way to the toilets in the back.<br />
<br />
Another hidden joy about being the other sex is how quick to use the restroom. Can’t say the same about the smell or how disgusting it was when Charlotte entered the club’s restroom. Beelining to the handicapped stall, Charlotte took out her phone and fired out a quick text to the only person who could save the night.<br />
<br />
“NANCY!! SAVE ME!!!” <br />
<br />
“Where are you?”<br />
<br />
“MEN’S RESTROOM! AND HURRY, SOMEONE JUST CAME IN!!!<br />
<br />
Charles, who is looking more like Charlotte again, holds her breath while the guy enters the other stall next to hers. She heard some grunting and then the most foul-smelling stench radiated from him. “Boys are disgusting,” was the thought ringing around her head while she kept holding her breath. Charlotte looked down to see how much she changed since she locked herself up from the thirsty girls and saw how much more she had gained and lost.<br />
<br />
The pants that she just bought today were now pooling on the tiled floor, mostly because her legs had shrunk along with the rest of her stature. Not wanting to keep dragging these nice pair of jeans, Charlotte undone her pants and took them off. Now clad in her sweater to cover her modesty, Charlotte just kept watch as her body continued to keep changing. Comparing herself to the stall door, she had lost over two feet of height which put her smaller than her normal height.<br />
Not wanting to repeat the last time she was shrinking, Charlotte pulled out her seemingly bigger phone in her tiny hand and sent another text to Nancy. “I’D SHRUNK PAST MY HEIGHT! PLEASE HURRY!!” with no response from Nancy. Feeling like she was left behind, Charlotte inspected what other changes the nanomachines had done to her.<br />
<br />
Not including her loss of height, the only other change that she could see was her assets. Her once manly pecs and ass inflated to a womanly breast and butt. But the growth doesn’t end with them growing back to their normal sizes. Instead, they kept on growing out and away from her. Charlotte turned her head to see her near-naked booty growing in the open air, to which she had the foresight to take off what would’ve been ripped jeans on her lower half. Her sweater struggled to keep covering swelling breasts which had grown so much that they dominated her view from below.<br />
Feeling that her transition from a tall, handsome hunk of a man to a small, sexy slice of a woman, Charlotte sends Nancy one last text. “I think my transformation is over. I’m going to try to make a break for the entrance. I’ll see you at the car unless you have a plan to save me.” So, with a sweater stretched over her loose globes and a blazer tied around her waist to cover her ass, she exited her stall and began to walk back to the door.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the mysterious man who had used the stall next to her also exited, without flushing the toilet. Standing over 6 feet tall to Charlotte’s 3 and a half, the drunkard leered down at the overtly buxom girl. Standing just tall enough to face his groin, Charlotte craned her head up to see that he was thinking about her. “I’m sorry, I went to the wrong restroom. If you let it slide, I’ll-” “Blow me.” Charlotte slowly backed away while the man undone his fly. “W-what did you say?” “If you blow me, I won’t tell a soul that you were in here getting your jellies. If not, all I have to do is to pick you up and…” he let his pants fall to the ground, his dick rosed in the restroom air.<br />
But before she made a choice, another clubgoer came into the bathroom. Seeing a man with his dick out with a little girl in the restroom, the clubgoer step back to the doorway and yelled, “Someone call the police! There’s a pedo here with a kid!” The music stopped and the lights turned on, alerting the clubers about what had happened. <br />
<br />
A few hours later and an arrest later, Charlotte found Nancy and rode back home in silence. “Thank you for telling the police that I came in with you. But where did you go, Nancy?” The only woman with legs long enough to reach the pedals of the cars said, “I was looking for someone to trust to go in the men’s rooms to help you. By the time I found a guy to trust and sent him to save you, you were almost turned into a sex toy.” “Well, why didn’t you text me that? Or answer the messages that I send to you.” By the time the two ladies made it to the house, Nancy only had to say this, “My phone died so I didn’t get the messages.”</p>
