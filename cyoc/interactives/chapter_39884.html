<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;S...satisfy her?!&quot; Josh said, his face flushing, &quot;You don't mean...you can't mean....THAT?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ric frowned in annoyance. &quot;Yes, I mean having sex with Francesca,&quot; Already he had stopped viewing the girl as the former Mr. Mendes, &quot;I mean, right now we're not going to be doing anything, but I am gonna improve us right no-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going too far Ric!&quot; Josh said, his high-pitched voice at a squeal, &quot;I didn't complain when you did this to Fran-.... to Mr. Mendes but come on, this is not fair! This is Mr. Mendes we're talking about, the awesome guy who's helped us out all this time. First you change him into a girl and now you want to use her as a toy? How the hell is that fair to Mr. Mendes?&quot;<br />
<br />
The silence that came afterwards felt like it lasted an eternity. It was finally broken when the brothers heard the shower faucet being turned on, followed by Francesca's beautiful voice humming. Ric sighed and scratched his head. &quot;Ok, ok, you're right. I'm going too far with this thing. I'm going to go to my room and figure out what spell is needed to turn Mr. Mendes back to normal.&quot; Before Josh could even mutter a word Ric had left the room and had shut and locked the door.<br />
<br />
Ric leaned on his closed door, his face breaking into an evil grin. His brother was such a spoilsport. How the hell could he even DARE suggest that Ric miss such an awesome opportunity? This was a one-in-a-lifetime chance, and Ric sure as hell was not going to blow it. He sighed. He really wanted to let his brother get in on the action....<br />
<br />
He shrugged as he focused on improving himself. He read through the book and found the perfect spell; the spell of aging. He read the language carefully and as he did he could feel his body start to change. His eye level rose with his increased height, his gangly arms became toned and somewhat muscular. Rico could even feel a bit of fuzz develop under his chin. So this was how he'd look when he hit 17... but it was not enough. He checked the book again and chanted several more spells, increasing the size of his penis and making it magically adjust to whoever it penatrated. He gave his skin a healthier, slightly darker complexion (as if coming from a beach) and increased the size of his muscles to the point where he looked like the perfect track and field runner. NOW he was complete. Ric contemplated; what could he do about Josh so that Josh would shut up...?<br />
<br />
Ric's eyes gleamed. He figured out a way that Josh could participate, would shut up AND would make the night more enjoyable. Ric quickly went back to the spellbook and read off several spells, not noticing that a dark aura was starting to permeate off the front cover of the book....<br />
<br />
Josh was busy trying to get himself some milk, wondering what the heck his brother was up to. He popped off the milk cap and tried getting a glass but could not reach it. He reached as far as he could then huffed after realizing his futile effort. He suddenly felt a wave of dizziness go through him, almost making him fall. He quickly recovered before he reached the ground. &quot;What just happened...?&quot; he said to himself, the confusion from the dizziness not letting him think of the possibility of it being Ric. He looked up... the glass suddenly seemed much closer. In fact, Josh could suddenly reach it with ease. He pondered the situation while drinking the milk, but his mind was quickly distracted by the sudden cramps - and a second wave of dizziness - that hit him. He grabbed onto the nearby table to steady himself, when something clicked: someone was causing this to happen to him, but who? The answer was on the tip of his tongue...<br />
<br />
He checked his body to make sure that nothing had changed. His C-cup breasts waved bouncily in the air as normal, and his brown, long hair was the same as well... reaching all the way to his petite, cute ass. Wait a second... he didn't have breasts or long hair.... did he? The person grasped her head. Things did not seem right to him but she was always a woman. Wait, wasn't she a man? What was he doing in the first place now?<br />
<br />
A final wave of dizziness hit the new 16-year-old girl, glazing her eyes over. Ric came out of his room knowing that his spells had worked; now he had TWO girls AND had shut up Josh to boot. The bedroom door opened and Francesca came out wrapped in a bath towel. She stopped immediately and stared at the other girl in the room, who was staring blankly at her body. &quot;Who is she?&quot; Francesca demanded cooly.<br />
<br />
Ric gently smiled. &quot;Why, you don't remember your best friend Jedina? You two've been the best of friends since I met you, and have always provided each other company,&quot; Ric's smiled broadened &quot;especially in the bedroom. We have had very &quot;fun&quot; times together no?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Jedina and Francesca zoned out, their eyes blank as memories were rewritten yet again. Ric grinned, wondering how long he had to alter the girls' personalities or if it was a permanent ability. Jedina snapped out of it first. &quot;Sorry Ric, I don't know why I dozed off there...&quot; she eyed Francesca, who was still in a stupor, and smiled lustfully. She moved over to the other girl, her hips swaying sensually with each step, and gave the other girl a wet, juicy kiss on the lips that was immediately replied to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for breaking me out of that,&quot; Francesca said, her need for pleasure building almost visibly, &quot;That was the best way to wake up period. So Ric,&quot; the two girls turned to Ric and grinned mischievously, &quot;When are we gonna start having some fun? It's boring standing here clothed and talking...&quot;</p>
