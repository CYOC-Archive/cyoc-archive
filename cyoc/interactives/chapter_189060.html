<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hon are you really sure about this?” Eliza’s mother inquired in worry over the News her daughter had given her. “Sure I’m sure Mum. I’ve not been enlisted at a Collage or University yet. It allows me time around the subject courses I’m aiming for. It’s at Aunt Chelsea’s Aquarium... frankly I don’t see any issues?” Eliza assured, “But Chelsea doesn’t do the mermaid exhibits and even then surely the artificial ones would be better off being used” Eliza’s mum insisted. “Right you’ve not heard” Eliza realized “Aunt Chelsea’s been approached to take part and it’s looking hopeful she’ll accept. Besides she needs the funds and unless you’ve forgotten I’m 19. In age to be transformed”. “Is their nothing I can say to talk you out of it?” Eliza’s mum asked. “Nope, it’s decided on my end. Just need to let Aunt Chelsea know her niece is also to be her first mermaid” Eliza assured.<br />
A little later within her bedroom after getting a travel bag out “So if this is settled we need to figure what you’ll be taking down” Eliza’s mum stated. “For what? Mermaids don’t exactly wear clothes” Eliza assured while reviewing herself in the mirror. She had long accepted she’d never have the giant breast or huge butt the more looks over brains idiots were famous for throwing away their hearts to, standing at 5.3 feet with shoulder-length raven hair and right now wearing a Yellow T-shirt under a Maroon sleeveless crop-jacket with cut-off below the knee jeans and gray trainers and possessing a slight athletic Caucasian build with a B cup chest. “At the very least maybe take a two-piece swimsuit, at most the top” Eliza’s mother suggested “I do recall allot of mermaids do wear them”. “Fair point” Eliza accepted.<br />
Before long at the Seabreezeer’s Sealife Centre “So you’ve agreed into using merfolk here as a crowd pleaser?” this gray trouser suit under a white Labcoat red-haired woman noted to the middle-aged brown-haired woman wearing the Aquarium’s fleece over a white shirt with red trousers and work boats seated opposite her at the desk within the main office reiterated. “Frankly if I don’t I may as well prepare to shutdown and reduce the interest of marine life in future generations” the woman stared firmly “Problem is...funds wise to start off in getting your clone mermaids risks our endanger’s breeding contracts”. “Mrs Lawrence, Mind I call you Chelsea while you call me Monica. If you reviewed our statements fully with your lawyer you’d surely be aware of the gap in prices between the Artificial and Transformed. By logic I can estimate Seabreezer’s can bring in more than enough within a year with a Transformed to switch to the Artificial” The Labcoated Woman insisted. “But that’s my problem... aside from my niece possibly during this gap year she’s taking I lack the staff, all trained in fixed divisions I cannot pull them from when not counting the tour guides and shops... and for those doing the tours and shops we’re to understaffed right now to pull extra shifts as cover” Chelsea explained. “Admittedly that might be an issue” Monica agreed in surprise.<br />
Just then Eliza knocked and came in “Hi Aunt Monica. I came to talk about- oh sorry” she called. “Speak of the devil... Eliza this is Dr Monica Reeds. Reparative of the company that handles the new merfolk trend” Chelsea introduced before returning her attention to Monica “My Niece Eliza Edwards”. “Your aunt just spoke of you taking a gap year helping here” Monica recalled kindly. “And as it happens your involved in a way with my planned role during that time” Eliza happily returned. “Well actually your aunt here claims issues. Can’t afford Artificial Merfolk but also can spare the staff for Transformed... bit of a pickle really as she admits she’ll surely need the boost” Monica then stated. “No longer an issue. I’m willing to be a mermaid for Aunt Chelsea for a year, maybe more” Eliza announced. “WHAT?” Chelsea shouted. “Here... my Driver’s Licence” Eliza then said while handing the card to Monica. “Oh your 19... So no arguing age restrains” Monica started while reviewing Eliza a bit “And your build is perfect. Good muscle tone, breast size is fitting... how is your swimming?”. “I’ve gone about 20 metres down and held my breath for about 6 minutes” Eliza confessed. “Eliza you are surely kidding us here?” Chelsea complained. “Nope. I want to do this” Eliza assured. “The equipment I had some colleges at the feeding area setup ready for this. Just need to sign the papers and I’ll call then to say we have a participant” Monica then stated kindly.<br />
Soon within the area for the staff to feed the aquatic charges linked to the tanks “Dr Reeds. Everything is ready. All we wait for is the volunteer” one of Monica’s colleges greeted as Monica and Eliza arrived, “Oh... Eliza. We didn’t expect you for awhile... oh and I think you may have heard your aunt offered one of us up” this late 20s dyed-red haired Asian woman in the Aquarium’s uniform called upon seeing Eliza before looking at Monica “Oh please don’t let it be me... I know I’m a doctor of marine biology but honestly I’d like the freedom legs allow me around here”. “It’s fine Yuko. You’re not the one” Eliza assured. “With transformed we do prefer it’s not under duress” Monica followed kindly before saying to Eliza “Now while it’s your choice over *cough* top or topless once the exhibit is open due to the process you need to enter the pod my colleges here setup naked”. “Hold on? You’re the one being transformed Eliza?” Yuko inquired. “I came here to let Aunt Chelsea know in advance to her final decision and as it happens I didn’t need to wait” Eliza admitted as she put the travel bag down to put her clothes in before she started stripping.<br />
Once Eliza was ready to enter the pod to be transformed “Now a few points to go over with being a mermaid” Monica started “First as opposed to the assumption of your leg bones being replaced by an extended spine or pure muscles, you instead have everything that’s covered by scales in terms of bones basically rubberised for flexibility... reason being to assure you’ll have usable legs when reverted, quick really to avoid lawsuits”. “I see... that’s actually news to me” Eliza confessed. “Second while the aspects to breathing underwater are not visible on your outer body as it’s all internal, as well as you’ll retain your ability to talk for emergencies, on average you can only service about an hour without breathing water in breathing air before...well I think that’s obvious” Monica continued. “So I can only remain emerged from the water for a limited time but stay submerged indefinitely... basically opposite to swimming as a human but with extending time” Eliza took note. “Finally just so your aware plastic surgery transplants are removed during the process though I see no signs of that on you and your breasts cannot be enhanced in size from the process” Monica finished. “Big breasts are a hazard in swimming so that’s a bonus” Eliza assured as she hoped into the pod and got ready.<br />
Once within the pod one of Monica’s colleges injected a sedative into Eliza before imputing the commands to start “Sorry for the injection surprise but it’s another safety measure as it’s best you sleep through the process” Monica apologised as the pod was sealed. “I still can’t believe young Eliza’s our first mermaid” Yuko meanwhile called out. “As I said we do prefer with the transformed they are willing participants. That being said I do hope you and your colleges will be sure to keep her company when off hours and healthy” Monica assured “Who knows maybe you may change your mind down the line”. “That depends” Yuko returned firmly “So then you’re done here at this point”. “In 10 hours actually... got to run some final tests for safety and maybe if she’s willing allow us some DNA for the mixtures for the artificial merfolk” Monica assured before explaining “our bosses insist we don’t use a single subject’s DNA in the process. Help avoid any repeats of a very early case post the start of operations”. “Amanda Judies case, I’ve read the story... Husband murdered her then when a mermaid using her DNA was showing signs of dispersing at the end of her lifecycle he claimed the mermaid was her” Yuko responded “Not for the new owners’ of his buddies sold off house’s workmen where he hid the body chancing upon it plus outside specialists proving the clone was a clone... well...”. “Even so it made a then safety suggestion many assumed silly minatory” Monica noted “By the way if you’re worried or interest, and honestly we advice it for mental well being,  you can stay with one of us while we monitor Eliza’s transformation”. “You don’t say” Yuko responded.<br />
Soon as time moved on Eliza slowly to the world but quickly in her sleeping mind when through the transformation process; her legs got locked together before the skin started fusing them into a single limb, as said all her bones from her hips downwards became flexible, her lungs and toroth were altered for breathing water, her toes started extending into branches while a gray membrane formed between then and as the membrane formed silver scales started forming all over her fused legs to finally create a tail (Silver being the sole colour of tails merfolk had regardless of gender or state). All the while Eliza was dreaming of the possibilities of attractions she’s be doing:</p>
