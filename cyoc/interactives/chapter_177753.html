<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiden woke up in Mark&#39;s protective embrace, his husband&#39;s muscular, hairy arms wrapped around his stomach. He could also feel Mark&#39;s thick cock pressed up against his butt cheeks. Aiden smiled. Even soft, Mark&#39;s member was about 7 inches long and heavy. He had vague memories of what having his own dick felt like, but that felt like a long time ago, and the thoughts felt alien to him. Aiden couldn&#39;t bear the thought of changing back. His pussy had opened him up to worlds of new sensations and new pleasures.<br />
<br />
Aiden squeezed out from his man&#39;s embrace, being careful not to wake him. He stood up and stretched, turning back to look at Mark, still snoring softly in their bed. Mark was an amazing hunk of a man. The power of the Chronivac had granted him a thick, muscular frame. His big pecs were broad and heavy. And of course, Mark&#39;s whole body was covered in a pelt of thick, dark hair. It formed a dense trail up his stomach, then spread out into a bushy tangle between his pecs, then marched right up towards his neck. A dusting of hair even covered his adam&#39;s apple to connect to his beard.  Aiden admired his partner for a few moments, smiling at how lucky he was. The sight of Mark was getting his juices flowing already, so he turned and headed for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
After relieving himself, Aiden washed his face and brushed his teeth, examining himself in the mirror. A few things seemed &quot;off&quot;. They were barely noticeable at first, but then became clearer and clearer to him the more he looked. Firstly, there was his ass. It seemed bigger to him: a proper bubble butt. It was smooth of course, but it stuck out quite a bit more than he thought it used to. Aiden turned so he could see his cheeks better in the mirror, and squeezed them with both hands, letting them fall and jiggle. Hmph. Aiden thought this was pretty sexy actually.<br />
<br />
Next, there was Aiden&#39;s chest. His pecs seemed fuller, somehow, and heavier. His nipples were definitely larger, and stuck out from his chest at least half an inch like pencil erasers. The areolas were larger too. Confused, Aiden reached up to feel them, but a gruff voice in the doorway interrupted him. It was Mark, coming to stand behind Aiden. At 6&#39;5&#39;&#39;, he was much taller than Aiden, and his wide, muscular body dwarfed Aiden&#39;s. &quot;Good morning, my adorable little pussyboy,&quot; Mark said, grinning. He rubbed the morning out of his eyes to get a better look at Aiden. &quot;Are you admiring the new changes we made last night?&quot; he asked. Aiden could see Mark&#39;s cock hanging pendulously behind him from a thick bush. It twitched a little in excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Changes?&quot; Aiden asked, but then he began to remember. They had made some additional changes in the Chronivac last night before making love and heading to bed. &quot;Of course, don&#39;t you remember babe? We thought we&#39;d experiment a little bit,&quot; Mark said, &quot;with this....&quot;<br />
and Mark roughly grabbed Aiden&#39;s ass cheeks with his big hands. &quot;And these,&quot; he continued, reaching his arms around and down to Aiden&#39;s new big nipples and giving them a squeeze. Aiden yelped and shrunk away, shocked at how sensitive his nipples were now. The feeling was positively electric, sending waves of pleasure down through his body, especially his pussy. <br />
<br />
Mark laughed. &quot;I guess they work really well, huh? Mine too...&quot; he said, reaching up his to tease one of his own nipples. &quot;We changed mine too, of course.&quot; Aiden could see the pleasure in Mark&#39;s face. Indeed, now that he looked carefully, he could see that Mark&#39;s nipples were also larger, poking out like his own, except from dense chest hair. There was no hiding those things. Aiden could tell that Mark&#39;s nipples would be easily visible through most, if not all of his shirts. Mark turned to show off his new ass, admiring it in the mirror. It was muscular and round, except covered in soft, dark hair. &quot;I think we did good, babe,&quot; he announced. &quot;But that&#39;s not all we did, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden was trying to remember. Suddenly, he began to feel warm. Those sensations from his nipples seemed to have triggered something. His chest felt like it was getting tighter, the skin stretching. But it was his chest that was getting fuller. At first Aiden thought his pecs were growing with muscle, but it wasn&#39;t muscle. Instead, a pair of breasts was slowly expanding on his chest. It was a pleasant, full sensation. They both watched in amazement at Aiden&#39;s growth. The breasts grew and grew, reaching a C cup. Aiden&#39;s new nipples were now obnoxiously pointing up and out from the smooth globes.  &quot;Wow. Those are some nice tits!&quot; Mark announced, &quot;C&#39;mere, let&#39;s check them out..&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden did as his Daddy asked, joining him in front of the mirror once again. He gingerly held them in his hands, feeling their weight, then letting them fall down, bouncing and jiggling. Mark did the same, pressing his body against Aiden&#39;s as he did so. He teased Aiden&#39;s nipples, causing the other man to gasp and moan in pleasure. &quot;Ooh yeah,&quot; Mark growled, &quot;I love my pussyboy&#39;s new tits. They are nice and heavy, aren&#39;t they?&quot; Aiden tried to answer, even protest a little. He was now feeling unsure about the new changes. Did we really want female breasts? But surely, he&#39;d agreed to these changes, hadn&#39;t he? However, Mark couldn&#39;t restrain himself any longer, with one hairy hand he was fondling Aiden&#39;s new breasts, and with the other, he was reaching up to finger him. Mark&#39;s mouth was on his, the thick mustache and beard tickling his face a little as they kissed. Aiden was growing moist. The feelings were overwhelming. Mark&#39;s big cock had become fully engorged, swelling up to its full 12 inches.</p>
