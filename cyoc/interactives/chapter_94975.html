<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You&#39;re laying on a bed as you wake up, and get an extremely weird feeling. You still feel somewhat human... until you look at the place were your legs once were. You gasp in horror as you see that your lower body has been replaced with a motorcycle, your human half blended into the cold metal.<br />
<br />
You try to get up, but your machine half is too heavy. However, you can feel the motorcycle as if it was just another part of your body. Your engine, carburetor, tubes, gas tank.... all of them feel like exposed organs. With a bit of effort, you try to move again, and you feel your wheels moving slightly. After many failed attempts to get up, you give up and just admire your new frame.<br />
<br />
Moments later, a woman and two strong men come into the room. The woman presents herself as Dr. Sanson, and begins speaking to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear, you were extremely lucky. You could have ended up as mud, or something like that. Be glad that at least you were able to keep your humanity, and that we have transformed people into these things before. Now, my assistants will help you come off the bed, but we&#39;ll need you to extend your kickstand so you don&#39;t fall. Please, do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
And just as if you were moving an arm, you extend your kickstand which was fondled before. The two bulky guys lift you up and carefully place you at the floor before leaving. Just then, you realize you&#39;re naked and quickly cover yourself up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, here&#39;s a bra that might fit you. I won&#39;t stare.&quot; she says. She then gives you a bra she had, and turn her back. You put on the bra, which indeed fits you, and tell the woman she can see again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s continue. You should be able to feel all of your lower half just as if were more parts of your body, which they indeed are. You should be able to ride by yourself very soon. We&#39;ll help you with that. Now, there are quite a few motorbike girls around, so you won&#39;t have much problems to fit in. Now you have the needs of both a human and a motorcycle. You&#39;ll have to eat, and you can do that by either eating like you always did, or... filling up your tank with gas. You&#39;ll need to have a ride once in a while, and you still have sexual desires, of course. Let&#39;s just say your pipes can do the trick: human food will end up coming out as gas from them, and they can be stimulated like genitals. You can move around with your wheels without wasting gas, but you&#39;ll have to turn on your systems in order to move like a vehicle would. However, keep in mind that you&#39;re more of a motorcycle than you are a woman, so don&#39;t be surprised if one day you just want to ride on the road for hours, or want to have maintenance, or want for someone to have a ride on you, or to lay standing, or receiving gas instead of food, or be treated like a normal motorcycle... It&#39;s absolutely normal.&quot; The woman makes a brief pause to clean her glasses a bit, and continues. &quot;We&#39;ll now help you with the first steps of your new life: we&#39;ll explain you how to ride and use your new parts, give you a test ride, and a quick tuning if you&#39;d like. We&#39;ll also put you in contact with some people who take care of motorbike girls, and then you&#39;ll be able to continue with your &quot;normal&quot; life&quot;.<br />
<br />
After the speech, she calls the two guys that took you off the bed, and tell them to hold your hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Ms. Ylviosa, please fondle your kickstand again.&quot;<br />
<br />
You proceed as told, and the two men quietly take you out of the room, holding your balance as you feel your wheels rolling. The newfound feeling of your wheels touching the floor and rolling through it is amazing, but you want to move them on your own as soon as possible... and try out the road. They take you to a huge room, and Sanson begins explaining how to move your wheels, keep balance and usage of your parts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... do it by yourself. I know you can. Turn on your engine, and begin rolling.&quot; Just as she told you, you think about &quot;changing&quot; something on your body... and your machine half comes to life.<br />
<br />
Oh. My. God. IT FEELS WONDERFUL! Why did they have to explain how to drive? You&#39;re a vehicle, you know how to do that better than anyone! Soon, you&#39;re running around the room, your wheels rolling at incredible speeds, your body sucking the gas on your tank and converting it into raw power, printed on your legs... no, wheels... You quickly forget you have a human half, and just keep running around like a regular motorcycle without pilot. Minutes later, you stop... but just because you want to continue with the procedure.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was AMAZING!&quot; you tell the woman. &quot;I felt invincible, so incredibly powerful, like I was just a common motorcycle!&quot; you shout excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s normal, these feelings should wear off quickly. The first turn on of the engine can be overwhelming... Now that we know you&#39;re working perfectly, let&#39;s get you a tuning if you want. Your carrocery is plain black.&quot;<br />
<br />
You just noticed that your metal is painted with a simple black colour. You also notice that your human half looks the same... but your hair feels funny. There is a mirror nearby, and when you stare at your reflection, you notice that your once black and long hair was now blazing red, cut in a short pixie style. You like your new look a lot, and you feel it fits you better than your old hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... i&#39;d like that. I want flames!&quot; you tell Sanson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flames, uh? I guess they can do that...&quot; she wonders.<br />
<br />
Soon, you&#39;re taken to another room where a guy with painting gear is waiting. Your human half is covered with a thick cloth, and the man begins working on your carrocery. It feels nice to be painted, but you get bored quickly. After what seems to be an eternity, the cloth is taken off and they come with a mirror big enough that it lets you look at your whole body.<br />
<br />
You look wonderful, beautiful... and sexy! Your human half is gorgeous, and your motorbike half looks powerful and badass with these red flames the man just painted over your once boring carrocery. You thank the painter, and they try to take you somewhere else. However, this time you don&#39;t let the muscular guys help you, and just go by yourself, now controlling your body to perfection, just as if you were born with a motorcycle instead of legs.<br />
<br />
The place looks like a garage with a big exit. Just before you ask, the woman tells you something.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re done with you. Since you obviously won&#39;t be able to fit through your door, you&#39;ll have to find a new home.&quot; She then hands you over a card, which says &quot;Lydia&#39;s MotoWomen Garage&quot;, with the address and the phone number, and the purse that you forgot you brought. &quot;This place is a big home for girls like you. If you go there and say that Dr. Sanson sent you, they&#39;ll give you a permanent place to stay, and they&#39;ll pick up your stuff from your home and take care of any legal shenanigans. Feel free to come back here if you need something... except for maintenance. Due to the nature of the transformation, you&#39;re pretty much indestructible and you&#39;ll never ever need any maintenance. Good luck, and enjoy your new life.&quot; The two guys go back, and the woman stays to give you a goodbye.<br />
<br />
You start moving towards the exit, excited to know how your new life will be...</p>
