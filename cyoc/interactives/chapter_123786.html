<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mmmm, cornflakes.&quot; Cassie said as she walked next to Jennifer. The latter just tried to ignore it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s grab some juice as well.&quot; Cassie continued.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you stop that?&quot; Jennifer exclaimed. She didn&#39;t really want to think about Cassie being able to at least partially chill at home, while she had to attend school with her full consciousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Was the answer she got.<br />
<br />
They continued walking. The busstop was not far away, from there they&#39;d go to school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cassie, you need to get me some food for lunch, I forgot.&quot; Jen said as she continued the already awkward conversation. She realized she&#39;d forgot to make her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Jen, I&#39;d brought my own lunch, but you can have it, I&#39;m still able to eat something at home anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Was Jen&#39;s answer.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
After 20 minutes, going by foot and by bus, the two arrived at school. Not shortly after, Sam joined them. &quot;Good morning!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sisters greeted Sam back, and afterwards Jen immediately cut to the chase:  &quot;Sam, I&#39;m still planning on paying Kyle back, for what he did to me yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam grinned. &quot;I thought you liked the changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes, but not the one he made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, so when do you want to do what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked Sam in the eyes. &quot;During the break, I want you to come to the bathrooms on the second floor. I&#39;ll handle the rest.&quot; She did have a secret weapon after all.<br />
<br />
The bell rang, and Cassie left the two behind, going to her own class. The other two went to theirs, walking next to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way Jen,&quot; Sam started, smiling, &quot;since when do you have four arms?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked down quickly, seeing her four arms, blushing heavily. &quot;I- I...&quot; She stuttered. Then she sighed. Looking to her right, she already saw Sam with a big smirk on her face, she was teasing her. Jen looked down again, folding her lower pair of arms around her, &quot;Since last night alright? Everyone was asleep already, Cassie was caught off-guard, and I was horny.&quot; Jen said, feeling both her pussies get wet as well, inside her pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-ha!&quot; Sam blurted, &quot;that&#39;s all I need to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
It was the last lesson before the break, Kyle was sitting a few places away from Jen, but in the same row as hers, and she had the advantage of being closer to the door. Because of that she could easily intercept him before he left the classroom.<br />
<br />
As the bell rang, Jen stood up, and confronted Kyle. &quot;A moment of your time please?&quot; She asked him, in a gentle, but firm voice. Kyle apparently wasn&#39;t too awake yet this morning, as he shrugged and followed Jen... towards the bathrooms on the floor they were now on. Once arrived, they saw Sam, and Kyle became a bit anxious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Kyle.&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello. What&#39;s this about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know about the town&#39;s curse?&quot; Jen asked him. Kyle gulped.<br />
<br />
Jennifer continued. &quot;Yeah, so something went wrong, and now we have the craziest malformations on our bodies.&quot; She wasn&#39;t lying, she literally stood in front of him with four arms and 3 boobs, and those were only the visible parts of her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re referring to her arms and such,&quot; Kyle answered, specifically not mentioning what Jen knew he wanted to say, &quot;You&#39;ve always had those, with or without the curse I gave you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Jen started acting, hoping Sam would follow. &quot;I wasn&#39;t talking about that Kyle, she said, biting her lip as to give it some more effect. If Kyle were to still have his dick, he&#39;d be getting hard right now, for he currently only felt the desire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me and Sam were talking about, down there.&quot; Jennifer continued, pointing with her finger towards her groin. &quot;We&#39;d like to try it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you follow us into the bathroom?&quot; Sam asked, gesturing at the ladies toilets. Kyle nodded, and they entered. Following that, Sam locked the door, just to be sure.<br />
<br />
But as the door was locked, wide, to Kyle disturbing grins appeared on the faces of both girls. Jen walked of to Kyle, and cornered him against a wall, holding him at his shoulders with two of her arms. As he tried getting away from her grip, she brought her second pair to keep his hands to himself. Kyle tried to resist, but it was helpless.<br />
<br />
Jen then turned to Sam, who was waiting for something to do. &quot;Sam, get my back, and open its front pocket.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam obliged in doing so, and as she opened it, she immediately knew what Jen wanted. What came out, in between to of her thumb and index finger, was a detached pussy, the one Jen got slapped in the face with. Her secret weapon with that.<br />
<br />
Sam walked over to Jen, who took the piece of skin from Sam with her lower right arm, and gestured her friend to hold Kyle. <br />
Jen started explaining why she&#39;d brought it with her:<br />
<br />
&quot;You see Kyle, I wasn&#39;t to happy with what you&#39;d done to me, just tricking me into the town&#39;s curse. Now is payback.&quot; Jennifer undid Kyle from his pants, and shorts. &quot;You must&#39;ve been sad about the loss of your dick, a few days ago, props to Jen for cursing you like that. I have a solution for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen stood up from her kneeled position, and held Cassie&#39;s pussy in front of Kyle. His eyes widened at the sight, and he tried to get out of Sam&#39;s grip. Jen cackled. &quot;Spread your legs!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was forced by both Jen and Sam to sit down. He obliged, but tried to resist madly. Some part of him had the desire to have sex with someone again, but his mind knew that this way was wrong. How could a guy during puberty have a vagina? It was something only possible in this town.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s legs were spread, and Jennifer didn&#39;t hesitate. She didn&#39;t sit in front of him, knowing what would happen if she did. She laid the pussy on the palm of her hand, the flat skin on the upside, and aimed for the gap between Kyle&#39;s legs. With a wet smack, the skin connected.<br />
<br />
Immediately after, Kyle&#39;s muscles contracted, and his heart rate shot up. His breathing sped up, yet it also stocked. Juices squirted out of his newfound pussy, the direct reason why Jen didn&#39;t want to sit across him. On that given note, Sam and Jen were maniacally laughing at Kyle during the 20 seconds that his orgasm lasted.<br />
<br />
Once his senses came to, his face turned white, and he looked at the two girls in anger. &quot;What did you do to me?&quot; He shouted, feeling humiliated. he tried to pull of the organ he was gifted, but got sent jolts of pleasure and ecstasy in return. When he failed getting it off, he put on his pants again, no longer wanting to be in the presence of the causers of his mischief.<br />
<br />
Sam and Jen were still laughing, as Kyle stormed past the two, unlocking the door and running out of the ladies bathroom. &quot;You were right Jen,&quot; Sam cried out, &quot;He was indeed flat!&quot;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
As their laughter faded, Sam looked at the clock. She turned to Jen, satirically biting her lip. &quot;The break isn&#39;t over yet...&quot;</p>
