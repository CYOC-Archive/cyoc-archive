<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You take out of one of the metal foil bags of dog treats and look at it. According to the small advertisement on the bag, the treats inside not only look like little bits of chicken, beef, turkey and other assorted meats, but will taste and smell exactly like the real thing. The advertisement then tells you to give them a try and see for yourself on how good they would be for your dog.  Despite your dubious feelings about trying something that is made just for dogs, and the fact that you don’t have a dog, you decide to take a bite out of one of the treats. Carefully you tear a small hole in the bag and shake one of the treats out into the palm of your hand. <br />
For a second, you just eye the treat. It looks like a chicken leg. And then you pop it into your mouth and start to chew it. Your eyes then widen and your breath quickens as a burst of rich, succulent chicken explodes in your mouth. You eye the bag as you continue to chew. It really does taste like chicken! It tastes like the best oven-baked chicken you have had in your entire life. You smile and lick your lips with delight. And for brief moment you chide yourself about how you felt eating something meant only for a dog. These treats are definitely good for humans as well as dogs. You shake out another treat from the bag, and see that it looks like a miniature rack of beefy ribs. You pop it into your mouth and chew it. And like before, you experience the same tantalizing burst of rich, meaty flavor. But this time with the rich, beefy flavor rolling around in your mouth, you feel something happening to you. <br />
The feeling starts with your shoes. They feel uncomfortable. So without missing a beat while shaking out yet another treat, you kick them off of your feet. Now it is your socks that are making you feel uncomfortable. They are ruining the pleasurable experience you are having with rich flavor of pork that you now got rolling around on the inside of your mouth. So you step on them and pull at them in order to get them off of you without having to stop what you are currently doing with these wonderfully tasteful treats. <br />
Standing on the tips of your toes and leaning against the countertop, you shake out a fourth treat out of the bag, this time another chicken leg. You quickly snatch the treat out of your hand and practically wolf it down without even bothering to chew it. You smile, lick your blackened lips and nose before letting out your tongue to pant contentedly from the sheer pleasure you are having with each treat you eat. Just then your pants and underwear decide to give you the slip. They fall off of your legs and hips into a tangled pile at your feet. Still panting contentedly you decide to take a brief look at the mess your clothing has made around your feet. And that is when you notice that you aren’t standing on the tips of your toes. You are standing on a pair of hind paws whose long bones have grown longer even as your legs have thinned out and grown shorter. You also note that your legs now resemble those of a very large dog. Your legs and hind paws are practically covered in a thick, rugged and shaggy layer of black fur. You smile and continue to pant seemingly unfazed by the fact you have the hindquarters of a dog now. What you see and smell looks quite natural to you. And then with a brief spurt of pain from your now furry rump, a docked tail emerges. You happily wag it before the smell of those delicious treats once again gets a hold of you. <br />
You turn shaggy head back to the countertop and notice that the bag is now a bit out of your reach. You try reaching for it, but what comes into view is no longer a hand but a paw tipped with running claws and paw pads. You try reaching for the bag with your other hand, but are met with the same thing. You whine and pant some more. You want to eat some more of those treats. But you have grown too small to really get them from where you are. Just then your ears twitch at the sound of something or someone coming into the room. You turn your shaggy head around and whine some more.<br />
Just then a police officer comes in. You see him and begin to pant and wag your tail excitedly. The human sees you as you are leaning against the cabinet with your forepaws resting against the countertop. He chuckles.<br />
&quot;Looks like you are really enjoying those treats, my shaggy friend. Need some help getting some more?&quot; He happily asks you.<br />
You happily woof at him and push yourself off and away from the cabinet. Now standing on all fours, you smile, wag your tail and pant as the police officer walks past you toward the countertop where your treats are. You look up at him as he picks up the bag and shakes out a treat for you. You pant excitedly, whine and then bark. But all your act does is to make the human smile.<br />
&quot;Sit, boy, sit!&quot; Your human friend tells you in a commanding voice.<br />
So you sit down on your shaggy haunches for him and then look up at him expectantly. <br />
&quot;Good dog, good boy!&quot; He tells you now in a happy and eager voice. <br />
He crosses the distance between you and him and gives you your reward for just sitting there before him. You snatch the treat out of his hand and wolf down the treat. And once again, you feel that same feeling you had when you found yourself changing into a large, shaggy dog. Your arms pull themselves in closer to your body and begin to become a pair of forelegs for you. Your chest deepens, broadens and lengthens. Your fur coat thickens out some more and takes on a shiny luster. You eye your friend again for another treat.<br />
&quot;Now beg, my shaggy friend, beg.&quot; He tells you in that commanding voice of his again.<br />
Realizing now that you have to perform a trick before getting your reward, you stand up straight on your shaggy haunches and feebly wave your forelimbs in the air before him. <br />
&quot;Speak, my boy, speak!&quot; He tells you.<br />
You bark twice for your friend and master’s enjoyment. And when you do so, he smiles and shakes out yet another treat. You smile and pant contentedly, knowing that you just pleased your master. His hand disappears into the thick beard and mustache surrounding your mouth. You like up the treat with your long, flat tongue and wolf it down. The pleasurable sensation of becoming a large, shaggy dog returns as your back and spine straighten out, and your nose and mouth push outward into a muzzle. Without being told by your master or seeing it for yourself, you know deep down inside that you have become a large Bouvier des Flandres. You have become this human’s canine partner. And those two feelings please you very much. <br />
&quot;Good boy, Champ, good boy.&quot; Your master tells you as he shakes the last of the treats out of the metal foil bag and uses them to beckon you over to him. <br />
You stand up on all fours and wag your tail. You feel very happy to be named by this human. And you feel very happy that you now belong to this human, both as his partner and as his pet. You pad on over to him and eat the last of the dog treats from his hand. And as you are doing that, he is fondly rubbing the backside of one of your docked ears, thus tripling the pleasure you are feeling right now. <br />
&quot;Sit!&quot; He tells you.<br />
You sit and happily watch as your master removes your shirt and puts it aside. He then straps your dog collar and uniform before attaching a leash to your collar. <br />
&quot;Are you ready for work now, Champ?&quot; He asks you.<br />
Looking up at him with love and affection in your melancholy-looking eyes, you bark an affirmative and then pant contentedly. You stand back up on all fours as your master and partner leads you out the door on the leash. And as you trot alongside him into the wide outdoors, you wonder what you are in for as a dog.</p>
