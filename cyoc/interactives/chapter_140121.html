<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I want whatever Andrew was on.&quot;  Sandra smirked.  &quot;I thought he was too straight-laced to try drugs.&quot;  She popped the candy into her mouth.  <br />
<br />
Daniel waited for her reaction, &quot;And?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It tastes like bland sugar.  Barely metallic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel looked at the grey sphere, &quot;I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s a worse idea to do it, or not to do it.&quot;  He decided he&#39;d suck it anyway.  &quot;But there&#39;s something more than drugs going on around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did see that weird light show...  Did he leave that?&quot;  She pointed to a satchel in the corner.<br />
<br />
Daniel, intrigued, walked over to inspect it.  Inside were several very old books on the occult, and ancient Amerindians.  Also some carved stone talismens and notebooks full of writing.   They take it back to the camp, where they can get a closer look at it.  It was now around 5 AM so Sandra went back to sleep.  But Daniel was curious.  He had been friends with Andrew for just a year, but never had he seen him act quite this strange.  He opened some of the books.  There was a lot of information, most of it over Daniel&#39;s head or in a different language.  He decided he would study until Sandra woke up, then they&#39;d get the first bus to an airport home.<br />
<br />
By the light of the fire, he could make out enough that Andrew&#39;s research revolved around a few common themes.  One was transformation – especially animal transformation.  Reading one page of notes about life as a lion, it seemed like Andrew was planning to become a were-lion.  But that would be crazy, right?  This centered around a few ancient depictions Daniel remembered in the ruins.  He grabbed a lamp and a book before heading back in to see.<br />
<br />
He spent a few hours trying to figure out the notes, until suddenly, he became really horny.  Out of no where he had a massive erection.  Since he was alone he figured he&#39;d take care of it.  Immediately he felt great pleasure as he pumped his cock.  Furiously, he pulsed multiple string of cum all over the ruin floor.  &quot;That was really good for just masturbating...&quot; he mused, satisfied.  He felt the sensation of a wedgie though.  When he tried to adjust his pants, the sensation was worse.  Then he turned around to find that he had a new appendage.  What appeared to be a six-inch tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the deuce?&quot;  He reached behind to handle it.  The sensation was felt in what was now *his*, somewhat hairy, tail stretched over his shorts.  The hairs looked to be blonde.  &quot;I have a fucking tail?&quot;  In disbelief Daniel turned away and looked at the notebook, he now noticed he got some semen on.  He flipped angrily through the pages, not even knowing what he was looking for.  Turning back around, he felt it again to confirm this was actually happening.  His tail was still there.  As Daniel fondled it in amazement he could see it was still slowly growing.  It was now eight inches, with a few brown hairs on the end.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit shit.  How do I stop this!?&quot;  He again started quickly flipping through the pages.  There had to be a cure.  He found something about silver effecting the transformation, but the details were hastily scribbled.  Trying his best to concentrate, Daniel was distracted by the sensations in his tail.  It was starting to twitch by itself!  He slapped himself in the face, &quot;Fucking focus dammit, or your going to be a freak!&quot;  Then he remembered the jawbreakers.  Andrew said they had silver in them!  But where did Daniel spit it out recently?  He thought for a minute, mentally retracing his steps.  His tail was now ten inches long and a little thicker.  Ignoring it, he grabbed the lamp and went to the ledge by the hieroglyphs.  Finding a small grey ball in dark rubble, was not going to be easy.  Ten minutes of frantic searching later he, miraculously, found it.  Wiping it off, he immediately tossed it back in his mouth and sucked like his life depended on it.  His normal life basically did.  He grabbed his still growing tail.  The tawny fur had filled out over the length of it, and Daniel could kinda move it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have loved a tail when I was younger.&quot;  He thought out loud.  &quot;...Now this is freaky as fuck...&quot;  At around a foot long, it thankfully seemed to stop growing.  Daniel took stock of this new development.  &quot;Well, I&#39;m part lion now...&quot;  He could swing it somewhat to the side.  &quot;Now when does it go away?&quot;</p>
