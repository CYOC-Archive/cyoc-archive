<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick nearly ripped the door, his heart skipping a beat as he and Emily tried to call out to Emily&#39;s father as he stood in front of them, holding the camera in his hands and right about to take a selfie as the mysterious camera shuttered and clicked. The light mesmerized his eyes as he quickly yelped and felt his hands rub them in vain to soothe them. The damn lighting always did that to him, and this would be no different. He&#39;d only hope that by the end of it, maybe Paul&#39;s mistake would have created a better timeline, or at the very least, fix their predicament. <br />
<br />
Groaning, Rick gently opened his eyes, and was greeted to his familiar hands and fingers, hairy arms, and his smile grew broader as he started patting himself and realized he was back to his old self once more. But there was something off, as he patted the firm upper arms and the resistant body that seemed trained for years. It felt bigger, more honed. He sighed, maybe it was too good for his own luck, but he wasn&#39;t going to complain, he was more than happy to see himself back in his right place and gently caressed his bearded face sighing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god... I&#39;m back... Emily, I&#39;m back! I-&quot; Rick called out, though, as he looked towards where Emily was, but couldn&#39;t find her anywhere. He looked back towards the home, and though the scenery had changed a good deal, she was nowhere to be seen. As Rick glanced up and down in shock, he had just noticed the deep grunt that came from behind him, and turned to see a true behemoth of a man with his back turned to him stretching. Broad was an understatement, with lats so large a normal dress shirt wouldn&#39;t fit him, though the loose tank top that was practically held by its last vestiges wasn&#39;t helping by any means. The mere silhouette of his width made Rick weak in the knees, and he softly gasped as the beast rolled his shoulders and flexed his titanic arms in front of him, the sheer presence of this paragon worked on his nerves. His massive neck tilted to the sides before it cracked, and the brawny man turned to face Rick&#39;s shocked demeanor. He was in all aspects handsome, rugged, with a chiseled yet bearded face to match his brutish physique. His eyes were tired, but had experience to them, and his chest had a massive canyon that threatened to bump his chin as he breathed deeply. <br />
<br />
The man hm&#39;ed, the schematics and files had either been placed in the new gym bag that was strapped over his more than capable shoulders, or they must have become the bag itself, and as Rick eyed the tree trunk like legs that caused the gym shorts to seemingly become wrapped to his gargantuan body, the beast eyed him and smiled. Smirking arrogantly, the man sauntered up to him with a gait of a king who owned it all and shifted his weight to one leg while he leaned on the doorframe, his entire body pressing up onto Rick as his chest was level with Rick&#39;s face. &quot;Hey, babe. I&#39;m thinking to head to the gym, but I forgot my goodbye kiss...&quot; He tenderly pulled Rick&#39;s chin to peer up to his face, and Rick&#39;s entire world was beginning to melt away. Memories of finding this hunk of a man at the gym and sharing jokes and tips with each other before a passionate romance had begun to boil was etching themselves into reality, and Rick&#39;s jelly like knees were of no help in the situation. &quot;I- P-Paul...&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul chuckled, leaning closer to Rick&#39;s nervous face, it seemed as if he loved when Rick behaved this way, so shy and in need of someone to protect him. To cherish him. &quot;Yeah, baby?&quot; Paul lingered, his eyes peering into Rick&#39;s and threatening to unleash feelings Rick hadn&#39;t known were possible to him. &quot;You&#39;re so... Big... I, um...&quot; Rick&#39;s voice faltered, suddenly thirsty beyond belief and forming coherent sentences were growing harder. Paul&#39;s mountainous chest heaved, bouncing up and down to Rick&#39;s inner delight. Whatever reality this was, Paul was turned into a perfect man, and Rick was slowly leaning into this reality with open arms despite the voice in the back of his head screaming at him for this change. Paul gently kissed him, Rick moaned as Paul&#39;s strong and thicker arms slowly found themselves pulling himself into his loving grasp. The behemoth was all too aware of Rick&#39;s sensitivity and goaded him into leaning onto him, Rick felt himself automatically moving his arms to wrap around Paul&#39;s large traps, before slowly cascading down to the impressive lats that gave him such a enormous presence.<br />
<br />
Rick broke away from the kiss, feeling himself on Cloud 9 and opened his eyes to the welcoming face of his man, his Paul gently reaching to his cheek and rubbing a circle with his thumb on his stubbled cheek. &quot;You&#39;re so good to me, baby...&quot; Paul beckoned, Rick obliged him with a smile, before reality caught up to him as Paul eagerly slammed a muscle bound arm on his firm rear end. &quot;I&#39;ll take good care of you today, kitten.&quot; <br />
<br />
Paul huffed, a mischievous smile written on his face as he grabbed Rick and sweeped him into his arms. Rick yelped, about to protest, before Paul growled as Rick&#39;s finger caught onto his nipple and he entered the house, slamming the door behind him with such a force that Rick gulped anxiously. If he wasn&#39;t careful, Paul could really do damage, was his first thought, but as Paul began to carry him upstairs and thinking grew harder to do, Rick&#39;s excitement built as he thought of Paul&#39;s new self giving him everything he needed, everything he wanted. He sighed, feeling like a prince, just as Paul chuckled and he entered their bedroom with triumph. Paul let Rick onto the bed with the care of an angel, as he huffed, he placed the bag away from the bed and tried to pull the tank top off him.<br />
<br />
He was beginning to see the kind of man Emily&#39;s mother had fallen in love with, and drunk from the cup of lust as Paul threw the tank top elsewhere, unimportant and unnecessary. He slipped out of his shorts and Rick gasped once more, in delight he found that instead of flimsy boxers was a sizable package that was tucked into an overflowing thong that was close to ripping. Paul flexed for his appreciative audience, posing eagerly and bringing his burly arm for Rick to cop a feel. &quot;Like that, lil&#39; man?&quot; Paul taunted, bouncing the muscle and watched Rick&#39;s excited face lit up. &quot;Hell yeah..!&quot; Paul grinned, before he made his way onto the bed and started to crawl towards Rick, who had pushed himself back to the baseboard in glee. On the prowl, Paul&#39;s burgeoned physique caused the bed to creak, and Rick soon realized with gusto, that this hadn&#39;t seemed to be the first time Paul may have broken the bed before, and by god, he was going to make it happen again.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Rick&#39;s addled mind became clearer to the circumstances, and though he tried, he felt the compulsive need to check for the camera. He turned his head away from Paul and glanced over the room before his eyes caught sight of the gym bag, it must have the camera in it, but he still didn&#39;t know what happened to Emily. Paul noticed his attention change and he tilted his head in confusion. <br />
<br />
&quot;You alright, babe...?&quot; He attempted to sit on his knees, hand making a beeline to Rick&#39;s outstretched leg just as Rick turned back to him with pleading eyes. He didn&#39;t want to ruin the moment, but he also needed to check for a camera. He needed to. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, just gimme a second, I think I might have left something in your bag...&quot; Rick said, heart thumping as he opened the gym bag as Paul reclined on the bed, arm propping up his head and body outstretched. &quot;C&#39;mon... C&#39;mon...&quot; Rick pleaded, sifting through socks, shirts, and even jockstraps before he found the camera, but within the camera the photo attached shocked him. Two photos had been taken, one of Paul&#39;s new self making a selfie with his handsome features gracing the majority of the photo, while Rick had been in the back, his own muscular figure smaller than his counterpart, but still no sign of the girl. On the other, however, was a shot that seemed cropped on Paul&#39;s adonis belt and crotch, the pink thong struggling to contain the treasure within. Could it be? It couldn&#39;t... He could hear Paul behind him, but the pictures that were in front of him were far more important.<br />
<br />
Thick thighs had pressed and pushed the fabric to the limit, and while scanning the musculature, realization hit Rick just as he heard...</p>
