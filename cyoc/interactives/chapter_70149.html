<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David's third week was much like his second. He went to work, did a mediocre job, went to the gym, lifted like a beast, went home, and jerked off. He ignored the daily worried text messages from Alex, as well as the one or two from other friends. Mrs. Somers would often give him a thoughtful look, her brow furrowed, before writing down something in her mysterious notepad. The old David might have worried about his job being in jeopardy. The new David was too busy catching his own reflection in any shiny surface. On Tuesday, he bought new shirts and pants, going a bit looser than necessary, to accommodate his growing body. By Friday, those clothes were tight once more - so tight he couldn't button the shirt all the way over his meaty pecs. He left a few extra buttons open out of necessity, giving everyone a nice view of the deep cleft forming down the center of his increasingly powerful chest. <br />
<br />
At work, the other employees were constantly whispering about him. He heard it occasionally, but paid them no mind. When they said something about an order coming in wrong, he rolled his eyes. When they mentioned how big he was getting, he grinned. And when the subject of drugs came up, he shrugged it off, whether it was a mention of steroids for his muscles, or something else for his brain. One day, as he carried a heavily-loaded tray out of the kitchen, there was a reference by one of the cooks to &quot;that huge sausage.&quot; It was obvious from the context that the 'sausage' being referred to wasn't the kind that the kitchen stocked for meals. That put a mile-wide grin on David's face. <br />
<br />
By Friday night, David couldn't wait to get home and measure himself. He forced himself to be patient though. At the end of his shift, he headed to the gym, as usual. His gym clothes were becoming quite tight as well, and as he went through the paces of his workout, he focused on adding more weight to every exercise, growling and snarling as he cranked out one powerful rep after the other. By the time his three hours were up, his body glistened with sweat, muscles pumped, veins all over, his tee shirt plastered to his sweaty torso, showing off his powerful physique. He caught a few stares as he left, and couldn't help a showy pec bounce as he walked out the door, past one of the hottest personal trainers. The athletic young trainer stared openly, and David gave him a coy wink before getting into his car and driving off. He'd caught the look of shock that had spread across the young stud's face when he got a load of David's fully-packed crotch. David had to rush home, before he exploded right out of his pants!<br />
<br />
When he finally arrived, David took time undressing before his mirror. He didn't bother showering just yet, liking the way the sweat highlighted his muscles under the lights. He began by stepping onto the scale. The digital readout climbed rapidly, before settling on 270. Fifty pounds of muscle in a week. He was adding it faster than before; the workouts were clearly paying off. <br />
<br />
He brought up his big arms, and slowly flexed. His sweat-damp biceps rose dramatically, bringing a broad smile to his face. He grabbed a measuring tape from the drawer, and taped off his right arm at an impressive 22 inches. He knew that some of that size was from the gym pump, and that some was from being flexed, but he didn't care. His arm was twenty-two fucking inches around. It made his dick harden even more than it already was. The tape went there next. Thirteen inches long. Just seeing the tape stretch across his huge dick made him shiver with pleasure. Just to double-check what he was seeing, he grabbed a ruler, and held it next to his big tool; it only reached up to the base of his big cockhead. <br />
<br />
It was all too much for David. The ruler clattered to the floor as he began working his cock over with both hands. He watched himself in the mirror, his muscles glistening wetly as he began to sweat once more. The sight of so much muscle flexing put his self-lust into overdrive. He beat off furiously, grunting and groaning, man-handling his huge cock mad glee. When he finally came, his big rod spasmed violently in his hands, bucking furiously, shooting huge loads of thick cum all over the mirror. David bellowed with ecstatic rage, pumping his big meat until his hefty balls were finally empty. <br />
<br />
When he had finally spent himself, he looked up at the mirror, a crooked grin on his face as he beheld his reflection in the mirror, obscured by ropes of pearly cum. &quot;Fuckin' a...&quot; he growled happily. He slowly flexed his meaty pecs, loving the sight of the two striated masses of beef obeying his command. &quot;One more week to go...&quot; he purred, &quot;Gotta get as big as fuckin' possible...&quot;</p>
