<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian looked at her as the question echoed in his head. &quot;Did he want to be with her?&quot; Yes, was the overwhelming answer, he would do anything to be with her.<br />
&quot;We can be together. Being silly is so much fun you will enjoy it with a girl like me.&quot;<br />
They could be together, he can be with her forever. Patrick was a she now, she was Patricia she had changed for him and he would do anything for her. A part of his mind rebel against this line of thinking. It was the part that still remembered who he was two days ago and that all this was totally weird. Patrick a girl? Patrick a clown? It struggled and yelped and pounded the inside of his brain trying desperately to wake him up but all this turned out to be a whisper compared to his wanting of this hot girl in front of him.<br />
&quot;Yes, I want to be with you for the rest of my life.&quot; Patricia gave a squeal of delight and pulled him into a kiss. The tingles on his lips increased tenfold and started to spread out over his face. A feeling of relief and release washed over him at making the decision, he felt lighter and happier. He felt the tingles race down his neck and flow out to his entire body, he broke the kiss and laughed. Looking down at his arm he saw the color of it fade out to a pure white and he suddenly was over taken with giggles and collapsed on the ground. The rebellion in his mind grew stronger and it struggled against the changes hoping to stop it. The tingles raced around his body he gasped in pleasure as they suddenly increased. Patricia rubbed his tummy and giggled.<br />
&quot;Shh.... Relax let it happen.&quot; Her hand moved lower.<br />
Brian&#39;s watched as his feet grew larger and shoot out of his soccer shoes and let out a laugh, most of him enjoying the change. Patricia leaned in and kissed him, his lips grew red and swelled becoming large and plump. He smiled and the smile forze on his face. His eyebrows vanished and became low arches and tiny blue stars appeared on his cheeks. He felt hair tickle his neck and ran a hand through his long hair pulling some of it into his vision finding it blue. <br />
&quot;I feel great, so silly.&quot; Brian commented to Patricia<br />
&quot;You are looking so beautiful, your almost there.&quot; The rebel part of Brian slowly faded. Then Brian felt an odd sensation in his stomach that made him pause his giggling. Looking down at his stomach suddenly he felt a suction sensation between his legs and a vacuum. The rebels rallied and surged and his hand shot down knocking Patricia&#39;s aside to feel nothing. His terror did not show on his smiling face as he felt for his manhood only to find a hole, he now had a womanhood. A cold sensation washed over him as he started to hyperventilate and a heavy sensation settled on his chest.<br />
&quot;What the fuck is going on?&quot; The fog in his mind started to clear.<br />
&quot;You said you wanted to be with me. I&#39;m gay so you obviously need to change for me just a bit.&quot;<br />
&quot;A bit?&quot; She stroked his face and he felt the cloud form over his mind again.<br />
&quot;We will be so happy together. You want to be with me don&#39;t you?&quot; Brian&#39;s mind filled with the need to be with her. <br />
“N…..” He wanted to say no, she wanted to get up and run but it was too late. It was a small change and she felt so good now. She looked up at Patricia and struggled but the fog rolled over her mind and her eyes glazed over.<br />
Briana looked at Patricia and nodded. She leaned forward and kissed her love. Pink eye shadow filled her eyes as her blue hair continued to grow down her back tying itself into two braids. Orange tights formed around her legs as a green skirt flowed out around her waist and a pink and purple polka dotted blouse grew on top. Looking down at her cute new outfit she saw the she now had small breasts poking out beneath the blouse and blue shoes on her large feet. The tingles surge to a tidal wave and looking cross eyed at her nose she saw a purple clown nose pop out. She gasped and felt the thoughts in her mind melt as her already average IQ was lowered, not being needed, and new knowledge fill her very empty head. Patricia helped her up, her girl the one she wanted to be with.<br />
Briana looked at Patricia with total devotion &quot;Thank you, I love you more than anything.&quot;<br />
&quot;I love you too&quot;</p>
