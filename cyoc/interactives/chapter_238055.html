<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike watched himself in the mirror and was in complete and utter awe. Thanks to the Chronivac, he has gone from a Middle age over worked husband and father with three kids and dead end job, to a 30-year-old man in his prime with a muscular build and a brighter future ahead of him. He watches as the day and night zipped by as his parents went in and out of the room like a blur as time was traveling back. And while he was moving normally, his clothes continue to flash by with some of those times seeing himself naked with a long sausage sized dick nestled between his legs with two huge balls dangling between. Checking himself out, he rubbed his well trimmed beard and was amazed at how much progress, or regress was made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn... Just look at me. I forgot how fucking hot I was before making some bad choices in my life. And just look at my baby. All big and meaty. Can&#39;t wait to fuck with any girl I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Checking himself in the mirror, Mike was amazed that how much he changed and sacrifice to get his body back to what it once was. But to him, it is not enough. While he is back in his prime state, he wasn&#39;t satisfied. That is why he used the Chronivac, to reround himself and the world around him to a specific time and year he can rebound and live a different life. And a man enter thirty means that it would get him back to when he was going nowhere. So he keep staring himself at the mirror as time keeps on rewinding back as the days and night zipped by in seconds as blurs of his mom and dad moved around the room.<br />
<br />
Looking on, he could see his clothes appearing and disappearing, transitioning from polo shirts, dress pants, muscle shirts, gym shorts, sneakers, dress shoes, suits, ties, the typical thirty year old stuff when he left the military to begin his search for a job, that would in turn lead to his boring, dead end, life. Though he smirked when he sees his half naked side, wearing boxers and swim trunks, even seeing himself fully naked with his huge dick and balls inbetween his legs. But by the time he left thirty and was re-entering his twenties, he could see that the most drastic changes were starting.<br />
<br />
For one, he could see flashes of himself wearing a military uniform and a military top and long camouflage pants, even seeing himself in camo gear and holding a rifle in his hand. Starring at that in the mirror, he could tell what it meant. He was going back to his time when he was at the military. It was a known fact that his family was mostly a military family, as his father was one, then his grandfather, and his great-grandfather. Which means that he was next in line to serve his country. But deep down, he knew that the military wasn&#39;t for him. There were certain opportunities he would&#39;ve take that would&#39;ve been more fun then doing mindless drills and going to battle. But his father forced him to go and it led him down the very path of nowhere. But now that he used the Chronivac to reverse time, he can actually remove his military experience and do something completely different for a change. Maybe even find true love pre military life. He just need to wait until the process is over.<br />
<br />
Looking at all the military attire flashing by, he smirked and said, &quot;Looks like I&#39;m going back through my military years. Time to remove that from my life for good.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he watches on, Mike can noticed the changes happening in rapid time. In his military suit, he always sees metals of honor and promotions he got. But when he was looking at himself, those badges seem to be disappearing as he was getting demoted down the ranking system. But that&#39;s not the only thing that was happening to him. Looking on, he could see every muscle in his body slowly deteriorating before his eyes. His arms and legs were thinning away as his chest didn&#39;t look at manly as before. Even his abs have downgraded into a six pack with a much thinner stomach. Looking at that, he never realized how much muscles he gained during the intense military training that he had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa... I so forgot that I wasn&#39;t that muscular before getting forced to military school. It is like five years of hard work and dedication were melting away. Oh well... Guess that&#39;s the sacrifice you got to pay to live a far better life then before.&quot; he said with sadness, but relief.<br />
<br />
Looking onwards, he knew that the changes aren&#39;t done yet as there is still some time to go before reaching his destined year, and to him, he enjoys watching himself regress and degrade through time.<br />
<br />
As soon as he left his military years behind, he could see that he was now sporting designer Ts, polo shirts, blue jeans, dress pants, sneakers, and loafers.  Even seen himself in a football uniform and gym attire from time to time.  No doubt, he was going back through his college days as he was rewinding through the 1990s at an alarming rate.  His muscles weren&#39;t shrinking like at the time he removed himself through military school, but it was much slower then before due to the fact that he was playing football since he was in grade school.  But the most drastic came with his face and hair.  Getting a closer look at the mirror, he could see that his hair was slowly shifting styles.  Normally, he was sporting a short crew top for a long time, but now that he&#39;s back in college, his hair was growing and shrinking in a few areas while the top part came down and covered his eye, making it look like a cow lick that was popular for college boys.  Not only that, but his beard was going through a transistion as the bristles and the side burns separated itself from the sides as the small hairs on his cheeks were slowly shrinking into his skin, leaving it smooth and nice.  Pretty soon, he didn&#39;t have much of a beard and was now a mustache and goatee combo with a ring around his mouth.  It was at the time he was only shaving around the mouth as he was trying to get comfortable with the look.  Still, no matter how he look, he was just a young, rugged, and handsome to the ladies.<br />
<br />
Instinctively flipping the cowlick up, Mike gave a coy grin and spoke to the mirror, &quot;Hey there good looking.  Like what you see?  Why don&#39;t come on over to my place so you can see the full package, if you know what I mean.&quot;  He soon broke out in laughter as he never behaved like that before.  Preferably because his body language is changing to match up with his age.  &quot;Wow!  I never behaved like that before since I graduated college.  Guess the Chronivac is making me match with the times.  Really need to get use to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
By the time he reached 21, the world around him slowed down with the days and nights normalizing and the blurs of his mom and dad were less like blurs and more like people coming in and out in reverse.  Soon enough, time stopped before moving forward at a normal pace as he was still in his parents bedroom, which was once his.  It was clear that he rewound himself and the world to 29 years in the past, leaving him in 1993.  Infact, he was on his 21st Birthday that day as he and his college friends would be heading to the bar to celebrate, without his family knowing it.<br />
<br />
Looking at himself in the mirror, he was nothing more then a college student who plays for the football team and is a young hearthrobe for the ladies.  He got quite the muscular build for a college student, not like his post military bod, but enough to show it off.  He was also dressed in campus shirt and varsity jacket with faded blue jeans and a pair of cleets for football too, looking like he was ready to train.  Combine that with a cow like hair style and facial hair combo, and you got yourself a stunning young man.<br />
<br />
Starring at himself in the mirror, Mike was impressed at the end result.  &quot;Yep.  There he is...  There&#39;s the young college lad I once was.  Man...  Talk about a hottie.  With a body like this, I can hit on the entire cheerleading squad.  Speaking of hitting...&quot;  Undoing the zipper and bottom, he pulled his pants and underwear down to see the damaged caused by the Chronivac.  From what he saw, his penis looked like it was lost a quarter of it&#39;s size and garth as the balls were now the size of oranges then grapefruits.  Feeling disappointed, he said to himself, &quot;Too bad my pal isn&#39;t what he should be in the future, but it&#39;s still functional.  A small price to get back in time to live a better life then before.  Good thing it&#39;s not farther back then this, I remembered what my dick was like before I hit puberty.&quot; he shuddered at the thought of what it would look like in his preteens.  &quot;So embarrassing...&quot;<br />
<br />
Putting his pants up, he turned to his former bedroom to see what has become of it.  After twenty nine years, the room looked more ancient then before with less modern furniture at the time, and more antique stuff in it&#39;s place.  He could even see curtains and blinders on the window as they were removed in 1995.  Starring at the room, he had a disgusted look on his face and said, &quot;Damn!  This place is old as fuck!  This isn&#39;t a master bedroom, it&#39;s an egyptian tomb.  Why didn&#39;t my parents get rid of this shit!  Guess they want to keep to the times is all.&quot;  Looking at the entertainment system, he could see that it was just a black box TV with a VCR and cable box on top of it.  Nothing high tech about it.  And check out the system that mom and dad had.  It looks so outdated then what I had in the future.  I mean, streaming services and smart TV are just imaginations of college kids my age.  It so pains me to see how things changes since the mid nineties.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking back at the mirror, he marveled at how he looked and said, &quot;Whatever...  At least I am back to my college age self and ready to take on the world. N o kids, no nagging wife, no worthless job, no military training, just a bright future and a lot of possibilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
With his hands on his hips, he acted all Superman and asked himself, &quot;Now...  What can I do to celebrate my new life and vigor?&quot;</p>
