<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon walked up to the dragons and stared them down trying to look intimidating. However the two idiots looked too drunk to get intimidated by Damon in the first place. Damon sighed and looked to the bartender knowing that these two would’ve been banned by now at any normal human establishment, but for dragons it was completely different.<br />
<br />
It was then that Damon had an idea, and he turned back to the two drunks with a wide grin and said,&quot;How about a bet? A bet to see who can handle their alcohol better, the two of you against me. If I win then the two of you fuck off, and get the hell out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon looked back to the bartender and nodded to him then the bartender nodded and said,&quot;Yeah, as long as someone is willing to pay up then I’ll be fine with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon smiled at this then Thoren ran up and asked,&quot;Blackfire what are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thoren trust me,&quot; Damon whispered,&quot;No matter what they want if they win won’t happen. They’re already extremely drunk as it is, and I can’t just let a couple of drunk assholes threaten my pregnant mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thoren paused then nodded to Damon slowly and said,&quot;Okay, uh...I trust you Blackfire, a...and I’m sorry. We shouldn’t have come here in the first place, and I should probably cut back on the drinks until I’ve laid the eggs too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon paused and nodded to Thoren and said,&quot;It’s okay, I promise I’ll take you somewhere nice soon, before you lay our clutch.&quot; <br />
<br />
Thoren blushed then kissed Damon and said,&quot;Good luck then big guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the drunk dragons then roared,&quot;Hey! Wh...*hic* what if we...win?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon sighed then looked at the dragons and replied,&quot;Well, name your price then if I would lose to either of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...if you lose....&quot; one of them said then they looked to Thoren and smiled,&quot;Th...then we get to have some...*hic* fun with your female.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bartender heard this and growled,&quot;This is NOT a brothel! If you do that here you two then you’re out of here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we’ll *hic* j....just go outside to fuck her.&quot; The other growled and Damon looked at Thoren and she looked back nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me dear, neither one of them will get to you, even if they somehow win this.&quot; Damon whispered to her and she nodded to him and whispered,&quot;I trust you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon then turned back to the bartender and said,&quot;Okay then in that case let’s go by local rules. The last one to pass out drunk is the victor. In other words, whoever has the most bottles before blacking out wins.&quot; <br />
<br />
Damon said this then slapped down a few pieces of gold onto the counter and the other two dragons meandered on up and did the same. The bartender&#39;s response was to give each of them a drink, and the contest began as soon as the lids were popped off.<br />
<br />
<br />
________<br />
<br />
<br />
Some time later...<br />
<br />
<br />
_______<br />
<br />
Damon was on his 31st bottle and the other dragons were keeping an astonishing pace with him. Damon knew he was drunk, and he was regretting even suggesting this contest in the first place. But as Damon started on his next bottle there was a loud thud right next to him, and he looked to see that the dragon had passed out drunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s....30, and I&#39;d say that’s a loss.&quot; The bartender exclaimed then the dragon next to Damon spouted out some kind of drunken gibberish and passed out as well. &quot;Aaaand, wow, that’s disappointing, 28, and Blackfire is 31 so I&#39;d say he is the victor!&quot; The bartender announced<br />
<br />
The entire bar erupted into a bunch of cheers and roads as dragons each drank to Blackfire&#39;s success, while others just didn’t care or just drank out of disappointment. Damon’s drunk self felt so accomplished that he opened his mouth to roar, but as he did he felt his stomach lurch. He felt the vomit enter coming up from his throat, and Damon quickly covered his mouth with his claws.<br />
<br />
A few trails of glowing magma vomit broke through the gaps between his fingers and Damon swallowed forcefully and groaned,&quot;Ugh, my....*hic* body wasn’t built for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of Blackfire! I could just kiss you!&quot; Thoren shrieked happily and wrapped her front claws around him then Damon growled as his stomach lurched again. &quot;I wouldn’t...*hic* I...vomited a bit in my mouth and....I think I might again soon.&quot; Damon groaned grasping his head with one front claw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it wouldn’t be the first time that’s happened. Either way I think you should head home before...well you’re drunk off your ass so you go figure.&quot; The bartender said then Thoren nodded at him and turned back to Damon and smiled,&quot;You’re so bold and stupid sometimes.&quot; Thoren then assisted Damon slowly out of the bar and onto the path towards their comfortable cave.<br />
<br />
Damon chuckled drunkly then leaned up against Thoren and hugged her. &quot;Aw, you *hic* know m...me so well, y....you brood....bitch.&quot; Damon laughed.<br />
<br />
Thoren sighed then said,&quot;Yeah, let’s go home you drunk asshole. You better not make a habit of this with our kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m okay to fly!&quot; Damon roared then Thoren growled,&quot;No! We&#39;re walking Blackfire, you beautiful drunk idiot. Honestly, I swear that you should be the one helping me since I’m carrying our eggs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon laughed then his stomach lurched again and not even 100 yards from home, Damon was vomiting up magma in front of his cave, and the hot red substance slowly flowed into a stream that flowed downwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is a story for the kids once they’re older.&quot; Thoren mumbled then Damon looked to her and smiled and said,&quot;Hey, wanna fuck again? I don’t c...care if I’m a bit drunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thoren blushed then growled,&quot;No!&quot; Damon’s cock unsheathed and he looked at her with a drunken smile on his face with his tongue out. Thoren blushed at this and smiled,&quot;Uh...okay maybe a little, but don’t you dare kiss me until we wash all that shit out of your mouth. If you puke on me I swear to god I&#39;ll kill you Blackfire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon laughed in response to this,&quot;Surrrrre.&quot; Damon was sarcastic in his tone and he wobbled on by Thoren barely taking her seriously in his drunk trance until she tackled him into the nest and pounded on top of him.<br />
<br />
Damon looked up at Thoren wide-eyed and she slapped him and growled,&quot;Tonight, I&#39;m the dominant one bitch!&quot; Damon laughed at this then playfully poked Thoren&#39;s snout and in response she grasped onto Damon’s cock and clenched it in her claw.<br />
<br />
Damon let out a loud and almost high pitched whimper then she looked down at him and said,&quot;I&#39;m not afraid to get rough too, I was male too, before I changed.&quot; Damon just stared back blushing then he grinned at her and let out a low growl,&quot;That’s hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thoren then sighed and positioned his cock beneath her pussy and slowly eased down onto it. Damon let out a moan of pleasure, but then everything went black, and whatever happened the rest of the night was an utter blur to him.<br />
<br />
The next day Damon woke up with Thoren on top of him, and he growled feeling the largest hangover in his life take effect on him. &quot;Arrgh! Fuck!&quot; Damon growled and Thoren sprang up still bound to Damon by his cock and she smiled then gave him a kiss on the forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning there horny boy,&quot; Thoren growled happily then she nuzzled up to his body and said,&quot;You know, you’re an asshole when you’re drunk, but you’re so much more of a sexy rake when you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon groaned and shook his head,&quot;Ugh, what...happened between us? I...think I blacked out, and now I’m stuck with a goddamn hangover.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thoren paused and saw the agony in Damon’s face then hers grew more serious and she asked,&quot;Oh my god, are you okay?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah just....might need to take a rest, maybe just stay with you today instead of hunting. I&#39;ll just go and...grab something from the meat storage probably.&quot; Damon growled and Thoren looked down and asked,&quot;Should I get off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon nodded to her and said,&quot;Y...yeah, but....are we knotted again, I might still be a little hard right now?&quot; Thoren blushed then attempted to stand up.....</p>
