<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adrian and Selena were babysitter haters. The only way they liked babysitters, was when they embarrassed them. They also had a baby sister too, which was great for distractions.<br />
Adrian and Selena owned a special disk, if you played it by someone&#39;s head for the night, you&#39;d have control of their bowels. You just had to say the words. One for poo, one for pee. <br />
Well, it just happened that Adrian and Selena&#39;s parents decided to go out for a week. Naturally, a babysitter was in need. They found one, she was nineteen and had babysitted a couple others in the neighbourhood. Adrian and Selena heard their parents talk to the baby sitter.<br />
&quot;Here are the emergency numbers.&quot; said their mom, Kate.<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Said the babysitter, Mary. <br />
&quot;Oh, and you don&#39;t wet yourself do you?&quot;<br />
&quot;What? No. I am nineteen years old. Why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because the last three babysitters have peed, pood or both right in front of me when I got home.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I am nineteen years old and do nothing of the sort.&quot; Mary said. Kate thanked her and payed her.<br />
&quot;Now, we have a punishment in this house. If any of them misbehave, or wet themselves, feel free to stick them in these.&quot; Kate said, holding up a diaper case. Mary nodded, took the case into her hand, and said goodbye. <br />
                             oOo<br />
&quot;I&#39;m in charge here now. My name is Mary. And you two must be Adrian and Selena.&quot; Mary smiled. The siblings nodded. Their baby sister was sleeping.<br />
&quot;Do you wet yourself?&quot; Adrian asked.<br />
&quot;No. Haven&#39;t since I was three years old.&quot;<br />
&quot;Have you ever pood yourself?&quot;<br />
&quot;No...&quot;<br />
&quot;Have you worn diapers recently?&quot;<br />
&quot;No! Enough with these silly questions. I am nineteen!&quot; Mary seethed. Adrian and Selena nodded and behaved for the rest of the day. Only the baby didn&#39;t. Lots of crying. <br />
&quot;Annoying baby.&quot; Adrian whispered.<br />
<br />
Mary thought that Adrian and Seluna were sleeping. They weren&#39;t. At 1:00AM, they got up and played the CD at low volume. After they played it a couple times, they tested it. Selena said the word for pee. Mary slowly peed. Adrian said the one for poo. Mary&#39;s sweatpants she was sleeping in slowly bulged. Adrian took pictures. Then, the two left. <br />
<br />
It was morning now and Mary woke. She felt kind of... Squishy. She looked down and froze. She was wet and squishy. She slowly pulled down her pants and underwear. She&#39;d done both 1 & 2 in her underwear. She hasn&#39;t even felt it! She went to the bathroom and changed. She came back in denim shorts. Adrian came up with the pictures and said the word for pee quietly. Mary started to pee. She gasped.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m nineteen. I&#39;m nineteen!&quot; She repeated over and over. Adrian crept onto her bed. <br />
&quot;Nice flow.&quot; he said. Mary turned and gasped. She covered her crotch. <br />
&quot;Ohmigod!&quot; she yelled. He showed her the pictures and her eyes went wide.<br />
&quot;When mom gets back, tell her you had a great time with us and we loved you.&quot; Adrian said. Mary nodded and went to change the baby, and answer her crying.<br />
<br />
Mary fed them breakfast.<br />
&quot;We should go to the park downtown!&quot; Selena smiled.<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know. That ones real busy, and the traffics bad too.&quot; Mary said. Adrian held up the pictures. Mary gasped. <br />
&quot;Take us.&quot; Adrian said. Mary nodded. They got changed, and drove downtown.<br />
<br />
The baby was in between the two siblings.<br />
&quot;Someone had a stinky diaper.&quot; Adrian said.<br />
&quot;Oh really? There&#39;s so much traffic here. I&#39;ll have to find a place to stop.&quot; Mary sighed. She pulled over and got out the diapers to change the baby. Adrian and Selena exchanged smirks. They said the words for poo and pee. Mary stopped cooing at the baby and changing the baby&#39;s diaper and held her butt. Then remembered she was in public. She quickly changed the baby and said, &quot;My pants are getting small. I&#39;m gonna go buy some new ones.&quot;<br />
Adrian smirked with his sister. That wasn&#39;t the reason. Mary took them all into the store.<br />
&quot;Take care of your sister while I&#39;m trying some jeans on.&quot; Mary said. The siblings nodded. Adrian stayed with the baby and Selena went to spy on Mary. She subtly peeled into her stall. <br />
<br />
Mary was trying on jeans. She&#39;d taken off her underwear and pants. Mary looked around and went into her purse. She pulled out a diaper. She pulled it up through the legs and put on the pants. She liked them. She walked out to the cashier.<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to buy these.&quot; Mary said, pointing to her jeans. <br />
&quot;Uh, miss? You have to take them off.&quot; the cashier said. Mary paled.<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t take those jeans off in five minutes, we&#39;ll have to take them off in public. Policy.&quot;<br />
Now, Mary was paralyzed. After two minutes. She started thinking. She could put on her poopy jeans, or reason with him... Mary started thinking about the pros and cons.<br />
&quot;Times up!&quot; the cashier said. Mary paled.<br />
&quot;Wait! Please-&quot;<br />
Mary&#39;s voice was cut of by the gasps turning into laughs as everyone saw her diaper. Adrian said the word for pee three times. Everyone saw and laughed. <br />
Mary paid for the jeans and walked away, putting them on, all dignity gone. She drove the car back home. <br />
&quot;That was funny.&quot; Adrian laughed. Mary glared and ran to the guest room, leaving the baby to Adrian and Selena. <br />
<br />
When Mary finally went to sleep that night, they got up, took off her bra, shirt, and sweats. They took off her undies and stuck her in just a diaper. Mary woke up and screamed. Across the hall, Selena and Adrian snickered. Mary went into the top drawer for a bra... There weren&#39;t any. Just diapers. She put a robe on and walked into the sibling&#39;s room. She opened her mouth, but Adrian beat her.<br />
&quot;Alright. We&#39;ll give you THIS bra, if you&#39;ll let us do whatever we want. If not, you&#39;ll be embarrassed beyond your dreams.&quot; Adrian said. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to do whatever you say.&quot; Mary sneered. She left in a jacket and diaper, covered by a skirt. Adrian nodded to Selena. Adrian said the word for pee ten times, and Selena did the same with the word for poo. Mary froze. Selena ran down and pulled down her skirt. Everyone ran out to see what was happening. One by one, stunned neighbours started to laugh. Mary pulled up her skirt and tried to open the door. Selena had locked it. Mary knocked on it and started peeing on her own. <br />
&quot;Ready for this?&quot; Adrian said, holding up a bra. Mary nodded frantically. Her diaper was clearly showing. The door opened and she walked in. <br />
Selena closed all the windows.<br />
&quot;From now on, you&#39;re the baby around here.&quot; Selena said. Mary gasped. She was nineteen! She started to protest aloud, but Selena stuck a soother in her mouth. She didn&#39;t change her diaper. She strapped a bra onto her. <br />
&quot;Sit.&quot; Selena said. Mary started to get onto her usual chair, but Adrian pointed to the high chair. Mary slowly transferred onto thy chair and heard the squish. She started to cry.<br />
&quot;Baby needs a diaper change!&quot; Selena chimed. She grabbed her and stuck her on the floor. They changed her, all the while Mary trying to block her privates from these two thirteen year old kids. Adrian made dinner and Selena des Mary baby food. She raised her hand.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Selena asked.<br />
&quot;May I go to the bathroom?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
&quot;Since you asked like that...&quot; Selena smiled.<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Adrian and her said together. <br />
&quot;Now we know you gotta go. So stand up, put our hands in yor crotch, and do the pee pee dance.&quot; Adrian smirked. Mary&#39;s eyes widened and her head tilted to say, seriously? But she saw they weren&#39;t kidding so she did so. She peed. <br />
<br />
It went on like this for all the week. Their mom was coming home in an hour so Adrian told Nary, &quot;You can either wear all your normal clothes, except for an obviously showing diaper, or you can wet yourself. Or both.&quot;<br />
Mary opened her mouth, but Selena cut in saying, &quot;She wants both.&quot;<br />
And so it was decided. Mary wore a T-shirt and a huge diaper underneath her miniskirt. She walked up to the door nervously to greet their mom.<br />
&quot;Hello Mrs. Perkins.&quot; Mary said and Adrian and Selena&#39;s mom gasped. She was wearing a diaper! Selena said the pee word fifteen times and Mary let out so much, that the diaper was falling. However; Adrian said she wasn&#39;t allowed to touch it. It fell. <br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; said mom. Adrian gave her the signal. She was allowed to touch t. She calmly pulled it up. <br />
&quot;You know what? I&#39;ve had enough of these lying, slobby babysitters!&quot; said the mom. With that, she pulled away her miniskirt and shirt and pushed her outside in a bra and used diaper. <br />
<br />
If luck would have it, Mary&#39;s boyfriend came out.<br />
&quot;Oh my God! I&#39;m so sorry, I&#39;m just being punished right now!&quot; Mary squealed:<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; he said. But then smirked he pulled down the diaper and changed her.<br />
&quot;Your welcome!&quot; he called, leaving. Mary gasped. <br />
<br />
Now, Mary is always reminded of that, and Adrian still embarrasses her in public, as does Selena. However, now Mary wears diapers, 24/7.</p>
