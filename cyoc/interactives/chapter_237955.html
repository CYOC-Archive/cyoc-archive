<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eddie watched in horrific fascination as the creature before him buckled and bent into shape, the engine head growing in size and horsepower, its exhausts growing in length, extending over his shoulders until they reached his thin hips, flaring outward in a volley of fire, his gloved hands growing larger, his fingers disappearing until his hands and feet had turned into fresh looking white wall tyres, snapping and contorting continued for what felt like hours.<br />
<br />
 A large skull formed around the engine, now resting in its jaws, extending into a long skeletal body, bones and ribs shaping into a familiar vehicular shape until at long last two headlights appeared on extended fenders over the new vehicles front wheels, it was truly a thing of beauty, almost bringing a tear to Eddies eye, where a demon once stood now sat a large vehicle of the underworld, a tour bus from hell.<br />
Walking over to his creation, Eddie marvelled at what he had created, the shell of the bus made from a multitude of bones and twisted metal, scorched and burned, its engine humming like a dream.<br />
<br />
But something grabbed Eddies attention from his new ride<br />
“So I suppose all of you want to avenge your leader of some shit like that?” He called out, spinning around to see the seven cloaked figures standing around him.<br />
<br />
“He wields titan blood”<br />
“The strings of creation”<br />
“Creations hammer”<br />
“The devils cry”<br />
<br />
All these words caught his ear as they murmured, gripping his new guitar tighter as they whispered to each other<br />
“Ok look I’ve had my fair share of violence today but if any of you want to sta-“<br />
Eddie was cut off as each of the seven removed their red robes, letting the crimson fabric fall to the ground.<br />
<br />
All seven were women, extremely hot women, decked out in spikes, chokers, leather and pure punk energy, he was at a loss for words, that is until one of them stepped forward.<br />
she was like a dark angel, narrow waist, wide hips, toned stomach, an impressive rack and a resting bitch face to boot, she was the whole package,<br />
Long flowing blonde hair, thick black eyeliner and lipstick, black spiked choker, demonic black tattoos on her arms and chest, black cropped tank top, baggy black jeans, chains, studded belts and spiked heels, Eddie had to remind himself not to drool.<br />
<br />
“We are the iron maidens, former attendants to the rager of the roads” she declared, resting a hand on her jutted out hip as she waved her hand towards the other women<br />
“Wha’sup” was all Eddie could manage to get out, getting a nod or nervous wave from the group before refocusing on the blonde.<br />
“ my name is Amalia, I lead the iron maidens, and I ask you mighty warrior, what do you call yourself?” She asked, her hand never leaving her side, or her sword for that matter.<br />
<br />
This was Eddies chance, to be a somebody, to be a legend among legends, to be a warrior of METAL!,<br />
Standing proud, guitar in hand he looked over all the iron maidens<br />
“My name, I am called many things, a rodie, a manager, a ladies man, but you can know me as Eddie” he spoke proudly, striking his most heroic pose he could manage.<br />
<br />
Amalia looked at him confused<br />
“What is ‘a ladies man’?” She asked, tilting her head in confusion<br />
Eddie couldn’t help but give a grin, confidently walking up to her, gently cupping her chin to look up at him, leaning in close to her ear<br />
“I’d be more than happy to demonstrate some time” he whispered gently, chuckling as she gave a small shudder, pulling back to see her cheeks flushed red against her pail skin.<br />
Looking around to the other maidens he could see looks of confusion from a few, jealousy from most, as well as a fair share of suspicion.<br />
<br />
Looking back at his new bus, Eddie wondered what would happen to theirs women here if he left, he could do that right? Just drive off and try and find where the hell he was, but he couldn’t just kill their boss and then abandon them, wrestling with his thoughts he didn’t notice as two of the other maidens approached him.<br />
<br />
The one in the left looked one shade of black from breaking out the white makeup and black markings, short black hair swept to one side, mocha brown skin, wide hips and shoulders, sturdy waist, large D cup rack, and her whole body plastered with tattoos, from neck to toes, wearing a sleeveless tube crop top, spiked silver chain necklace, elbow to wrist fingerless gloves, long flowing skirt with slits all the way to her hips on either side, revealing a pair of frilly lingerie panties, jet black to boot, and speaking of boots, knee high leather healed boots.<br />
And then there was the one on the right,<br />
Puffy short white hair, enough eyeshadow and liner to sink a ship, piercing of every kind, small frame, ample bust, narrow hips, black spiked choker, chain necklaces, studded sleeveless black jacket, white skull t-shirt, studded belt, black miniskirt and skinny jeans.<br />
<br />
Needless to say Eddie was feeling a little outnumbered now as they marched up to him, the white haired one going first, <br />
“I’ve never seen titan blood weapons used like that before, why all the sliding and moving around all wild?” She asked with a curious glint in her sapphire eyes, the dark one chiming in before Eddie could even think to reply<br />
“And why not simply use the notes for attacking, you almost looked like you were having fun, not fighting to the death” she spoke bluntly and plane, but what they were saying stumped him.<br />
<br />
“Why wouldn’t I be having fun, it’s music REAL music” he grinned, guitar in hand as he jumped in the air, slamming a power chord as he landed, shaking the ground and the room around them, cracking the walls and letting sunlight bleed in.<br />
Recovering from the shock, the maidens regrouped, when Amalia spoke up<br />
“What do you mean, what is REAL music?” She asked, tentatively reaching out to touch the guitar, only to recoil from the heat its strings were emitting<br />
“Well where I’m from, we call it, heavy metal” he grinned, slamming another chord, the demonic instrument purring under his control as the walls around them came tumbling down<br />
“Now THATS how you bring down the house!” Eddie cheered, quickly running over to the new bus, looking back at the girls as they looked around at each other.<br />
Eddie rolled his eyes before becoming them to join him, the falling rubble of the room around them landing next to where they were standing probably aiding in their decision as they hurried over to clamber into the vehicle.</p>
