<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rok sat in a chair at a table that contained only 5 things: a pitcher of water, two glasses and two big pink pills. The blue-skinned cyclops stared down at the objects. His opponent, a red-haired Irishman in his late thirties, sat opposite him and grinned. Mind Dolan. He seemed affable on the surface, but Rok knew the redhead was absolutely insane.<br />
<br />
He’d seen it. Rok owned the Book of Divination, which granted him psychic powers. Minor Telekinesis, Clairvoyance, Precognition, Retro-cognition, Psychometry and Minor Telepathy. His Book was powerful, but not something used for direct attack. What it did was provide him information and using that information, make a proper choice.<br />
<br />
They’d been ambushed in the bathroom by the Dolans after Xavier and Troy had gotten into a fight. Now they were fighting the Dolans-some of them, at least. He knew that the Dolans were not all on the same page in regards with how to deal with them. Technically, this split of Dolans was the best thing that could happen to them. If he could win. <br />
<br />
Now, sitting here on an otherwise empty stage on the Soul Floor (the 3rd floor) of the casino, there wasn’t anything all that useful for him to see. He wasn’t confident he could pull off the win anymore.  Every object here had been created from something else with the book of transmutation. His Psychometry was, essentially, useless.<br />
<br />
Precognition was difficult because of how many Bad Ends he could see. He’d have to be very careful with his choices here. Rok hadn’t activated his retro-cognition yet, because he wasn’t sure how many other people had even performed this challenge here. It seemed very makeshift. Telepathy wasn’t picking anything useful up either, other than a surge of bloodlust.<br />
<br />
He saw Rusty run in out of the corner of his eye.<br />
<br />
“He can’t help you.” Mind Dolan grinned. “Barrier spell cast by Arcane Dolan.”<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t expecting his help.” Rok snorted. “What’s the game?”<br />
<br />
“Simple!” Mind Dolan leaned forward and indicated the table. “Pick a pill. Hope you don’t ingest the poison.”<br />
<br />
“Poison?”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s a reality shift that ends with you ceasing to exist.” Mind Dolan smirked. “I prefer to be completely rid of any of my opponents.”<br />
<br />
“SO if I get it wrong…”<br />
<br />
“If you get it wrong, reality shift.”<br />
<br />
“Right, you said that, but what sort of reality shift?” <br />
<br />
“Another of our special VR games, I suspect.” Mind Dolan smiled. “Or maybe a phantom mare for our stables. Or perhaps you’ll be transformed into a reward for one of our employees, like a cocksleeve for a janitor. All of them are inanimate transformations, though. Living beings have a pesky tendency of remembering who they were.”<br />
<br />
“Why the game?” Rok asked. “Why not just dust me?”<br />
<br />
“What would be the fun in that?” Mind Dolan smiled. “You think you’re smarter than everyone else. Beat me and prove it.”<br />
<br />
Rok sat back in his chair and contemplated the pills. Mind Dolan had set this up as a binary choice. That should make Divination easy. Perhaps that was the trick? What was Mind Dolan&#39;s true goal or strategy here? Obviously, to take him out of the game. Probably to take his Book, but it felt like there was something more to this. It was a calculated strategy to take Rok out personally, not just because he was a Book owner.<br />
<br />
He knew that all of the Dolans came from other worlds, other timelines. Had he wronged this version of Dolan? Unlike Troy or Rusty, he certainly wasn’t an innocent person. He played the game just like everyone else and his decisions-made with perfect foresight, mind you-could come off as callous or ruthless. If this Mind Dolan had been someone he’d hurt, then of course he’d wish for revenge.<br />
<br />
Rok placed a hand on one pill and attempted retro-cognition. The only thing he got-as expected-was that it was created that day via transmutation. Nothing else. Same with the other pill. If he had the Book of Arcane (which he would have if Troy and Rusty had listened to him and not fought Myth), then he’d almost certainly be able to defeat this challenge.<br />
<br />
Using Divination on the pills…risky. Very risky. The reality shift might affect him even if he was only viewing it as a possible future. That might be the trap he assumed Mind Dolan had set up for him. The problem was, if he <I>didn’t</I> use his spell, he’d be done for. Literally the perfect trap.<br />
<br />
There had to be some way to detect the poison without falling into the trap.<br />
<br />
His bag of tricks was limited. Clairvoyance would be useful…if he’d used it much earlier to monitor the Dolans. Which he <I>was</I> doing, before Xavier turned them into goons. This had to have been a pre-planned setup, they likely waited until everyone was distracted to set this up.<br />
<br />
Telepathy wasn’t giving him anything. Book of Mind was blocking most of the thoughts he could normally pick up. Maybe he could use Psychometry on the other objects on the table? retro-cognition might work, too. But…what if Rok had already been defeated in a different timeline and he ended up trapped in a reality shift again? The same trap, but from a different version of himself.<br />
<br />
“The clock is ticking, Rok.” Mind Dolan said. <br />
<br />
“And?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I forgot to tell you.” Mind Dolan smiled unpleasantly.”You have ten minutes or I force you to choose.”<br />
<br />
Rok reached out to the left pill. “Divination.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
The world was shadowy and dark. Sounds were muffled and Rok could taste something oily on his tongue. A cool breeze brushed past his lips but he couldn’t even shudder. He could vaguely smell something like a barn around him. Rok was confused as to what he was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
A horse gave a whinny nearby and Rok could hear the clip-clopping of it’s hooves. The sound grew louder as it walked towards him. He could see the vague outline of a horse as it trotted up to him and sniffed Rok’s face. It snorted and Rok could feel the hot exhale of breath against him.<br />
<br />
The horse’s tongue licked across Rok’s mouth. It lapped outside Rok’s engorged lips, the touch was so good that he wanted to shiver. The tongue dug deeper, prying open Rok’s mouth. The warm, slimy organ tasted of old hay. Rok almost lost himself in the eager laps and chuffs.<br />
<br />
After a few moments of oddly comforting laps, the tongue withdrew, leaving Rok dazed. Then the horse reared up and landed on Rok’s back. Rok saw a huge cock pointed at his face. It had to be two feet long, mottled pink and black with a flat head. The cock flexed and twitched, and Rok could smell the musk and barnyard stink of the stallion. The stallion gripped the side of Rok’s body and slid forward. The smell intensified as the belly slid past and the crotch loomed ever closer. <br />
<br />
Rok saw the cock was dripping precum, the huge dick’s veins pulsing visibly across the skin. The dick jabbed at Rok’s face and bounced off. The warmth and pressure of the huge cock against Rok’s lips was both humiliating and yet, oddly, fulfilling. This was Rok’s entire purpose, after all.<br />
<br />
The former cyclops tried to shake the weird inanimate thought away. As Rok battled with the simple desires of an object, the cock bumped against his face again and again, each failed thrust pleasurably jarring his thoughts loose .<br />
<br />
Finally, the horse bellowed and thrust its pelvis one final time and the cock managed to split open Rok’s lips and slide in. The stallion hilted all the way to the back of the former cyclop’s throat. The throbbing, fat, warm cock filled all of Rok’s insides. He could smell the equine stench of the horse, his face buried deep in its pubic fur and the furry testicles resting on his chin. Lube sloshed out of Rok’s mouth, dribbling around the base of the mottled shaft and rolling down the stallion’s huge balls.<br />
<br />
There came from deep inside Rok a soft click and a whir. Rok’s throat came to life, contracting and squeezing around the horse’s length. Rok’s insides inflated and deflated, air flowing in out of his lips, creating a suction as he began to milk the stallion. The horse chuffed and whinnied in pleasure. <br />
<br />
The stallion thrust again and again into Rok’s well-lubed throat, splattering lube against its underbelly. Rok was all but lost in the pleasure and the deep-seated sense of fulfillment he was experiencing. The stallion’s big black orbs slapped against his chin over and over again. Holding a thought for longer than a second was impossible as each thrust jangled his thoughts away. <br />
<br />
Finally, with one final thrust, the stallion shuddered and its cock started to contract. Cum flooded into his throat and was forced up and out of his mouth. There came another whir and the semen began to get sucked away somewhere in the back of Rok’s throat, down into his stomach. The horse kept squirting, emptying its balls and seizing with pleasure, his head buried in Rok’s back.<br />
<br />
Rok felt so full, wet with thick yellowish horse spunk. There was a wet puddle on the floor below them as the device in his stomach failed to keep up with the flow. The stallion shuddered and heaved as the semen trickled and slowed. Its floppy cock slipped out of Rok’s mouth and dibbled on the floor as the horse trotted away, stallion-hood dangling.<br />
<br />
Then Rok heard the sound of another horse walking in. He barely finished his cleaning routine when he was mounted again. And again. And again, over and over and-<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
-Rok managed to pull himself away from the Divination.<br />
<br />
He leaned back in the chair, belly sloshing and full. He burped, tasting thick horse semen on his tongue. His belly was swollen with jism, purplish colored from stress and distension. He licked his lips, savoring the heady musk and flavor of the horse cum.<br />
<br />
“Not looking good for you, eh Rok?” Mind Dolan smirked.<br />
<br />
“Whuh-” Rok swallowed and ran his tongue across lips that felt rubbery. “What was that?”<br />
<br />
“Looks like phantom mare or autojacker.” Mind Dolan shrugged. “Almost had you by the looks of it. You’ve got seven minutes left, by the way.”<br />
<br />
His entire body felt oddly numb and warm. The rubbery texture of his lips had covered his entire body.  Little seams crisscrossed his form. Rok felt swollen and relaxed. That scared him a bit, as he hadn’t realized how good it would feel. <br />
<br />
Rok stifled another cummy burp and reached his strangely numb hand out and touched the other pill. “Divination.”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Rok found himself on a coffee table in a rather messy bachelor pad. He dimly recognized it as a room in the hotel, likely a staff member’s private room. An ash tray lay next to him, almost full, and empty beer-cans were piled on the floor next to the table by a pair of dirty underwear. The whole place stank of stale cigarettes, old beer, and musk.<br />
<br />
The door opened and a rather imposing, rough-looking anthro-wolverine sauntered in. He was stoutly built with burly arms, a wide chest, and a navy baseball cap turned backwards on his head. The wolverine was wearing a beige jumpsuit with the name <I>Grendel</I> stenciled across his thick chest. His shaggy fur stuck up around the collar of his shirt. <br />
<br />
Grendel unzipped his uniform and let the top half fall open, revealing a wife beater that had a couple of holes in it and was covered in stains-paint, oil, and beer. His bulky body stretched the fabric of his t-shirt tight across his chest and biceps, showing off the toned muscle there. The wolverine lumbered to the bathroom, scratching his ass. He pissed heavily into the toilet, letting out a fart and a chuckle . The toilet flushed and the wolverine walked to the couch and flopped onto it with a heavy grunt, then put his smelly paws up on the coffee table, shoving cans off of it to make space.<br />
<br />
“What the hell is this, a flashlight?” The wolverine’s meaty paws closed around Rok’s tube-like form. <br />
<br />
The wolverine glanced down and saw a note next to the object. He picked up the note and turned it over in his hands.<br />
<br />
“Dear Grendel-We thank you for all your hard work as the head of the janitorial services.” The wolverine mumbled out loud. “Please accept this gift as a part of our gratitude. We hope it will help you relax.-Dolan.”<br />
<br />
Grendel’s shaggy wolverine features split in a toothy grin as he stared down at the cocksleeve in his hand.<br />
<br />
“Well, well, well, wonder who you were, cocksleeve?” The wolverine rumbled, lifting Rok’s form and inspecting him. “Not that it matters anymore more, eh?”<br />
<br />
Grendel stripped off his jumpsuit and wife beater and kicked off his boots. His stomach was undefined, but broad and firm, a wall of muscle and fat that lent his form the heft of a boulder. His short, thick legs and broad feet carried his weight well, and between them his package was a pudgy fist of male wolverine flesh. His round balls were the size of lemons and hung low and fat against his thigh. His cock, a four-inch soft fat log, nestled down on top of his big balls. He was uncut, the bulbous head of his cock shrouded in a thick flap of foreskin.<br />
<br />
The wolverine flipped on some gay porn and settled down on the couch. He popped open a can of beer and chugged it, belching heartily and wiping his mouth on his arm fur. He glanced over at Rok, and picked him up. The wolverine spat into Rok’s opening and inserted a finger into Rok’s mouth, rubbing the spit in.<br />
<br />
Rok felt a thrill shoot through his and wanted to moan, the wolverine’s thick digit probing inside an orifice that was even more sensual than when he’d been a phantom mare. His ass, mouth and cock had combined into one sensitive, rubbery tunnel. More warm spit drooled into him, the finger pushing and spreading it deeper.<br />
<br />
Grendel turned his attention back to the porno and lit a cigarette. He took a puff and blew it into the cocksleeve. Rok’s head spun as the second hand smoke filled him. The wolverine tugged on his thick, ebony shaft. He scratched his armpit, eyes not leaving the TV screen and took another puff, tugging himself to full hardness. His meaty log soon stood a proud, thick ten inches long.<br />
<br />
Rok wanted nothing more than to taste the wolverine fat, juicy meat. And soon, he got his wish. The wolverine lifted him up and shoved him onto his turgid cock. Rok’s mouth and throat stretched out as Grendel’s cock filled him. The cock was warm, musty, sweaty with the day’s exertions and just as the former cyclops was beginning to enjoy the salty taste, he was pulled off with a <I>plop</I>.<br />
<br />
Rok was dazed, wondering what the wolverine was doing. But it was like he was just another object to the wolverine. He was idly watching the movie, taking gulps of beer and chuckling at the action on the screen.  His cock pulsed just beneath Rok’s lips, bead of pre forming at the tip. The former cyclops wanted nothing more than to encase that big, masculine length in his warm, moist, mmmouuuwwwmm-<br />
<br />
The virile length forced itself deep inside him. Rok swallowed and swallowed, his inner lining roiling and suckling on the shaft with delight. The cock stretched him nicely, as though he were designed for the wolverine’s mighty dick. Soon he was hilted, the musk of his pubes and the sweet tickle of pre all he could sense.<br />
<br />
Grendel settled himself deeper into his couch, spreading his legs wide. Rok was pulled off his cock with a surprisingly long, lewd slurp. He was greeted by the wolverine’s immense, shaggy form. His cock jutted lazily out of his crotch and over the couch, drooping under its own weight. Grendel groaned lustily and Rok began his descent back down the meaty spire.<br />
<br />
Rok’s mouth stretched wide around the glistening, swollen cockhead, the foreskin pulling back under the stimulation. He accepted the length smoothly, like it was his purpose…and it was. Grendel’s warm cock burped up a load of pre and it coated Rok’s mouth and throat thoroughly. He pulled back and pushed down once more, lodging the bulbous head in the back of Rok’s tunnel. Rok began gulping and contracting his inning lining, desperate for more, the toy stretched and bulged from the wolverine’s obscene girth.<br />
<br />
“Ahh, fuck, you feel so good!” The wolverine growled, tongue lolling out.<br />
<br />
Rok felt a thrill shoot through him. It felt so good making Grendel’s cock happy. He could feel it throb with pleasure inside of him. Rok was practically delirious, stretched taut by the wolverine’s sheer girth. When he was with the horses, he felt humiliated, now he felt a strange sense of pride well up inside him.<br />
<br />
Grendel pumps grew faster now. The more he fucked Rok’s mouth, the better the cocksleeve felt. Rok loved to give a good blow job, but this was more. Grendel dominated his throat, the surly wolverine snarling and plunging his cock into Rok’s throat faster and faster.<br />
<br />
Rok’s lips were pulled taut around the wolverine girth. Another burp of pre slithered down his liner adding more lube. He could feel the veins on Grendel’s dick pushing against his thin liner, his entire body wetly massaging the massive shaft. His liner was vibrating, as though all his muscles had been converted into some kind of massager dedicated to stroking the wolverine’s cock-flesh and encouraging it deeper and deeper inside of him.<br />
<br />
Grendel obliged, shoving himself deeper down Rok’s love tunnel. Down and down, as hard as he could until he *popped* into the farthest reaches of the toy. Rok’s head swam with unthinkable pleasure from all the stretching. The wolverine’s entire length throbbed and pulsed warmly inside of him. There was a whirring as something started massaging Grendel’s bulbous cockhead.<br />
<br />
The wolverine threw his head back and gasped in sheer ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Rok’s mind was on fire as the wolverine began slowly pumping again. Grendel’s toes were curling into the carpet. His only thoughts were about pleasuring that beautiful cock, like a good cocksleeve should. Rok cradled the husky mustelid’s length, body completely shaped to his cock and being jerked along his girthy pillar.Every inch of Rok’s inner lining worked Grendel’s length, warming, wetting, massaging him, caressing and squeezing his glorious expanse and tasting the sweaty, musky flavor of Grendel’s meat. <br />
<br />
Every twitch of that cock made Rok shiver in pleasure at the satisfaction. He could feel the wolverine huffing and snarling, knowing that he was close to the end. With a snarl and grunt, the wolverine cock flexed and filled Rok up with hot streams of wolverine seed. Rok’s mind was lost in a sea of warm, musky spunk and the sense of deep fulfillment that came with serving a purpose.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, that was good.” The wolverine moaned and tugged the cocksleeve off with a wet, lewd *splorch*. He set it on the table next to him and fell asleep, snoring loudly.<br />
<br />
As the cum inside of Rok began to cool, his thoughts began to fade. Soon, only a contented, well-used cocksleeve sat on the coffee table. It was happy to serve as the wolverine’s sex toy. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Mind Dolan smiled as Rok disappeared. Three chips rolled across the table and he snatched them up in his hand.  Just as planned.<br />
<br />
“Guess you’re gonna make someone very happy.” Mind Dolan chuckled to himself and rose to his feet. “Or are making someone happy. Time travel and reality shifts are so hard to understand.”<br />
<br />
Rok’s Book was sitting in his chair. Mind Dolan grinned. They didn’t have the Book of Divination yet, so it would be a big win for them. He reached for it.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” A voice yelled angrily at him.<br />
<br />
Mind Dolan paused and turned.<br />
<br />
An angry-looking Kirin stood below the stage, holding a strangely cute puppy-seal-fish thing. His finger was pointing at Mind.<br />
<br />
“If I don’t grab the Book, it’ll fade away.” Mind Dolan kept his voice level. “I Suggest-”<br />
<br />
“Inanimate.”<br />
<br />
