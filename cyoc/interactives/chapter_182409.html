<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave&#39;s eyes burst open as the alarm clock blares, squawking in that same irritating tone over and over again. With a groan he roals over onto his back and swats at the clock, missing several times before his hand hits the mark of the snooze button temporarily shutting it up long enough for him to throw the covers off and motion his way towards the clock to shut it off proper. <br />
<br />
Dave then sits on the edge of his bed, and rubs his face to help get the sleep out of his eyes as he thinks to himself about his dream and what exactly is all this going to mean, with you stuck in your predicament, alone in the other room permanently trapped in 2D. He can&#39;t hide you forever and a hyper-realistic painting of you in his house that can move and talk isn&#39;t exactly going to stay unnoticed forever...<br />
<br />
&quot;-sigh- I&#39;m going to have to get him out of that painting before people start to notice he&#39;s gone missing...&quot; Dave mumbles to himself as he makes his way over to his dresser and takes off his PJs. &quot;I mean, sure I can tell your teacher your boss your sick and can&#39;t come in today, but... how many days can I do that before people start getting worried?&quot; Dave ponders as he puts on his work shirt and jeans. &quot;What was the meaning of that weird dream anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave then finishes putting on his work clothing then opens his bedroom door, making his way into the living area. He sees your still there inside your painting. &quot;Ah good, it isn&#39;t empty... wait...&quot; Dave squints a few times at your scene, cocking his head slightly to the side as he makes his way to the kitchen dinette to make himself some coffee. &quot;Am I seeing things right...&quot; Dave says as he rubs his eyes again, but no. His eyes are fine. &quot;He&#39;s still standing there posing? Why?&quot; Dave then shakes his head a bit. &quot;I&#39;ll deal with that in a minute... I need to get some coffee to deal with today&#39;s crazy...&quot; Dave breaks his gaze from your scene and makes his way over to the kitchenette, starting up the coffee maker and grabbing a granola bar to eat. Dave munches on the granola as he finishes setting up the coffee maker, then turns back toward your scene as he makes his way over to you.<br />
<br />
Dave examines your scene closely, &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s definitely still there alright, but did he really not move at all all night? Like, seriously?&quot; Dave then examines the artistic strokes and coloring on your body, while you do seem hyper realistic, there still are those slight details that give away your just a painting to anyone who would see you and didn&#39;t know you were turned that way. Dave then motions his hand onto your painted torso, thinking to himself as he moves to touch you, -does he really want to be a painting that badly?- <br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s hand then makes contact with your scene, you are completely lost and rambly in your dream, enjoying the euphoria that weaves itself through your whole body and thoroughly enjoying being stuck and inanimate in 2D, but are suddenly snapped awake from your own dream, like a deep static shock just suddenly hit you and rocketed through your body, you burst awake and your vision swirls around 180, looking back out of your painted eyes and outside of your scene. It&#39;s Dave! But, why does he sound sooo... muffled? His words start coming back into focus rather quickly as your body is still waking, and that electrical, jittering sensation of being touched by someone who is in 3D is starting to ripple through your body. <br />
<br />
&quot;D... Dave?&quot; You say lazily. &quot;Yeah its me, you okay? You look like you haven&#39;t moved since yesterday evening.&quot; You still kinda waking up lazily speak to him back, &quot;Haven&#39;t m-oved s-since ye-yester-day-y?&quot; Dave replies, &quot;Yeah, your still standing there posing as if to wave &#39;hi!&#39;&quot; You now a bit more awake, &quot;But, th-that&#39;s w-waa y-you tol-d me t-to doo?&quot; You then remember, you haven&#39;t been able to move since Dave told you to stop moving. &quot;! D-dave! I-its b-b-be c-c-cause I c-can&#39;t m-move!  I, I have-nt been a-able ta-ta move si-ince yester-day whe-when you s-sto-pped ta-ta-touching m-me!&quot; Dave&#39;s eyes go wide, &quot;You, can&#39;t move? Like... at all? Not even a little bit?&quot; &quot;N-no!&quot; You reply, &quot;I kept try-ing t-till y-you whe-ent to s-sleep! I- I even tr-tri-ed to c-call y-you for- h-he-help!-&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave goes silent for a little while, thinking deeply about your situation, you do genuinely seem to be serious which is making him worried. &quot;Okay, so he can&#39;t move now on his own. Now, and I don&#39;t have a whole lot of time before I need to get to work today, so I need to make this quick... Ahem, you listening to me?&quot; &quot;Y-yeah.&quot; You reply. &quot;Good, because I&#39;m going to need you to try moving.&quot; Interestingly, you nod in compliance as you say &quot;Okay&quot;, without realizing your moving. Then you squirm a bit under his hand. Dave then tells you to stop. &quot;Okay, you can move if I tell you to and you stop when I want you to stop. I&#39;m going to let go of your painting, but I want you to try moving on your own after I let go, okay?&quot; You motionlessly without moving say &quot;Okay&quot;. Dave then takes his hand of your painting, and the rippling euphoria feeling fades from your body. You try over and over and over again to tell your body to move, but nothing is happening. Dave then touches your painting. &quot;Holy shit you really can&#39;t move anymore... Okay, umm. I want you to move freely, and of your own accord.&quot; You then physically nod again and say okay. Dave then says, &quot;Now I&#39;m going to let go of your scene again, okay? I want to see if you can move freely without me needing to touch you and pose you and everything. And if you can, can you try to stop doing that wavery speech thing, its kind of making it hard to hear what you have to say.&quot; Dave then lets go of your painting, and you fall backwards, landing on your bum inside the painting when Dave lets go. You then rub your head and silently motion as if saying &quot;Ow...&quot; You can hear your own voice again when your mouth is moving and you then try to shake your head and sit up. You then feel the rippling euphoria come back again as Dave touches your image for a 3rd time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Dave. I can move again!&quot; You say to him happily, though a bit disoriented. &quot;Good.&quot; Dave then replies. &quot;But, before I have to go to work, I wanted to ask, Did you have any strange dreams?&quot; You then look at him and ask, &quot;What do you mean? I was a painting. Like, for real this time after I fell asleep... I could see myself all night, I couldn&#39;t move at all in any way, I was able to focus on any part of me and feel pleasure in that part of me fairly extremely, but that feeling ended the moment you touched me, I was just starting to focus on my hair when you woke me.&quot; Dave looks at you fairly concerned with that answer. &quot;You mean you felt yourself be still and... enjoyed it all night?&quot; He asks. &quot;Yeah, but for me it felt like it was only 30 minutes or so since I got to sleep... To be honest, I feel like I could stay like that all day if you hadn&#39;t had awakened me...&quot; Dave then speaks up again, &quot;Okay, so my friend is genuinely enjoying being a real painting, joy.&quot; <br />
<br />
You then shift to your side a bit and blink a few times at Dave. &quot;Dave, did you have any weird dreams after to left me?&quot;  Dave then looks back up at you, pausing for a bit before speaking. &quot;Yeah, I did... I saw you weren&#39;t in your painting. There were some paint brushes around the easel and you jumped up from out of frame and startled me. You looked more like a cartoon than anything in reality, like you actually were made of paint in my dream, and you had a different attitude too. You outside said you were my painting and that I was your artist and shit and then asked why I hadn&#39;t painted you up like a french girl or some shit, It was weird, I was going to talk to you some more in that dream but, then my alarm woke me up and...&quot; Dave then hears the coffee maker hissing as the maker nears empty. &quot;Shit dude, I have to leave for work in 3, are you going to be okay all day in here when I need to leave?&quot; You look down at your feet, &quot;I wanted to be a french girl?&quot; You say muttering to yourself quietly. &quot;Dude! Pay attention!&quot; You snap out of it and jump up to look at Dave. &quot;Oh yeah yeah! I&#39;ll be fine in here if you have to leave, It&#39;s not like I can leave this painting anyways...&quot; &quot;Yeah I know that, and I&#39;m still trying to figure out a way to solve that... But it&#39;ll have to wait till after I get back from work. I&#39;ll tell your teacher you called out sick today or something so no one will know that your well... Stuck in 2D... -sigh- god dude, I fucking hope you aren&#39;t permanently 2D, everyone&#39;s going to think that I killed you or something if you go missing and stay stuck in there for weeks... Anyway, I know its blank and all but I really need to get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave then lets go of your painting as he rushes over to the coffee maker and pours himself a cup of coffee, then grabs a bagel and a bit of cream cheese before making his way out the door and grabbing his phone, wallet and keys. Dave then locks the door behind him as he makes his way to his car and prepares to call your art teacher to tell them you won&#39;t be coming in today. Meanwhile back in your blank scene, you look around a bit sigh, &quot;What the fuck am I going to do all day alone in a blank scene? At least, I can move again, so that&#39;s something...&quot;</p>
