<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Go on and pout…miss pouty tail.” Laughed his now mermaid mother as she jokingly scold Terry like she used to do to himself and his sister when they where little. However back then, he had been a five- or six-year-old boy not a newly transformed mermaid. <br />
<br />
His now feminine hands had brushed against her breasts blocking them from his mother’s octopus like legs which she was now using as extra set of arms as she began to braid your friend’s Jack’s now silky black mermaid hair. Terry didn’t realize how sensitive they were and had to fight back the pleasure that came from simply touching them. <br />
<br />
He had hoped that his mother and best friend didn’t notice but he was wrong.<br />
<br />
“Well…” said Jack as he….well now she swam up behind him and pulled her backwards so that his shoulder blades where touching Terry’s new breasts. “I know you are still fighting your new feminine side but if you want I can help you embrace it.”<br />
<br />
Jack kissed the back of his now thinner neck, brushing away the long braid his mother had done with her silver/white hair. One of her hands rested on his tone stomach right below his breasts while the other rested on his hip on her silver blue scales.<br />
<br />
Terry’s pale skin flushed a deep red which really stood out with her pale skin.<br />
<br />
His pale skin.<br />
<br />
“No….” said Terry forcing back that sudden urge to lean back into his friend’s embrace.<br />
<br />
“Alright, just thought I would offer but there are plenty of other fishes in the sea for both of us.” Said Jack as she moved back toward Terry’s mother who once again began to work on Jack’s new long black flowing locks. <br />
<br />
Terry turned away from his mother and best friend only to have his eyes fall on a bare-chested handsome merman who caused his heart to flutter for a moment as his mind filled with images of that powerful merman taking her into his arms and doing things to her. <br />
<br />
Him…not her, he was a man not a mermaid.<br />
<br />
He turned away from that merman only to see a beautiful mermaid who had the brightest red hair she had ever seen and had perfectly shaped breasts and an ass which was to die for. Her long red and bronze tail was breathtaking as well. Terry imagined those perfect lips brushing over her own lips.<br />
<br />
His lips…not her, he was a man not a mermaid.<br />
<br />
Terry had read that some researchers believed that all mermaids and merman were bisexual in nature. Maybe they had to be, because of the larger proportion of mermaids to merman or maybe it was a mental change along the lines which made people accept mermaidhood.<br />
Terry was lost in thought, fighting erges of his new mermaid body when the massive trailer pulling them came to a stop.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked around before suddenly two doors opened up along the side of the container, however no water rushed out, for the doors led to a water filled chamber.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to Mermaid virus processing center 15.” Said a voice over underwater speakers. “Please go in an orderly line to be processed and receive a bunk.”<br />
<br />
It was anything but orderly as their seamed to be a mad rush of mermaids and merman heading toward the door. The door, while large by the standards of any normal human didn’t really take into account the many different sizes of mermaids and merman. The jellyfish mermaid had a lot of trouble going through given that this woman new lower half was basically one of those ballgowns from the 1800’s with how wide it was.<br />
<br />
Terry got in line with his mother behind him and Jack right behind her as they kept moving forward. Going into what seemed like a water filled warehouse which had large doors leading outwards. Multiple floating tubes went upwards toward one area where it was clear still human people were monitoring everything. Those tubes went down to what looked to be computers. <br />
<br />
Since the mermaid virus the technology of water proofing electronics had been rushed forward.<br />
<br />
“Name.” said a merman floating behind a desk. <br />
<br />
“Terry Mormon.” Stated Terry as the merman turned a small camera and took a photo of him. He then answered questions about his original sex, age and the like as the merman typed something up. <br />
<br />
“Are you with anyone?” inquired the worker<br />
<br />
“Actually, she is my daughter and this is her best friend.” Answered her mother “My other daughter and husband are still missing.”<br />
<br />
“Ok…not surprising we are getting a massive influx of people; I can put some beds besides yours if they should arrive.” Stated the worker “Give me their names, I will put it in the system if they show up we will send them towards you.”<br />
<br />
Once given gave them wristbands.<br />
<br />
“Section P subsection 7 Bed number 17.” Stated the worker as they were moved on into the next room. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t a room; it was the open sea.<br />
<br />
Maybe that was too harsh, but it looked like one of those refugees camps a massive tent city with mermaids and merman swimming over the tents. A large center…road maybe was clear leading out away from the shore with large pole sticking up with A1, A3, A5 and so on to 9 on one side and A2, A4, A6 and so on to 10 on the others.<br />
<br />
“My God, how many people are here?” inquired Terry as they swam down the line, he was much faster then his friend Jack and leagues ahead of his mother. They had to swim all the way to section P, from here they could see teams of mermaids, merman and human divers working on placing barrier nets further away as new signs with sections Q-V signs going up.<br />
<br />
Terry found his bed, it was a sandy bottom with a sand bag as a pillow. The tent had a thin mess cover to allow some light in and the sides were super thin as well. It was just long enough for him to fit in while his much larger octopus mermaid mother couldn’t fit in hers. <br />
<br />
“Well, this sucks.” stated Terry as he lay down on the sandy bottom. He didn’t think he could fall asleep like that but with everything that had happened sleep quickly overcame him as he fell asleep there on the ocean floor.</p>
