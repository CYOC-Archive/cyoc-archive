<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was roughly noon on Tuesday November 21 when the whole of the United States was made aware of what was being called the furry pandemic. An emergency announcement made by the President gave off a vibe that exuded false hope. Despite the President’s carefully worded speech; those who witness the live broadcasts of what was happening in all over the word, knew what was coming and that there was no stopping it.<br />
<br />
So when his phone rang, Zach knew who it would be. Checking his caller id confirmed as he swore; he knew his thanksgiving leave was getting cancelled as he saw the videos. This was call from his commanding officer to muster back to base.<br />
“Just don’t pick up,” a fellow bus passenger looking at the well-built man with a crew cut saying; as he observes the man in fatigues put down his ruck sac.<br />
“Got to,” Zach answering; “or the M.Ps track me down and haul me up for charges. Private Owens here,” Zach accepting the call; “Yes sir. Yes sir,” Zach repeating as he responds to the unknown officer on the other end. “No Sir,” Zach sounding firm; “I am on civilian transport. I can’t just take over. I understand sir,” Zach sounding exasperated; “IF I may sir, is it your explicated order I commit a half dozen federal offences just to get back to base? I’m not the only on the bus,” Zach answering; “and I’m being recorded.”<br />
Zach chuckled as he hung up; smiling as he bought himself some time as he pulls the chord to get off the bus.<br />
“Back to the Seattle-Tacoma Airport I go,” Zach sighing as he hops off the bus; sending off a text message to his family in Seattle. He wasn’t going to make it for the holidays.<br />
<br />
***************************<br />
<br />
IT took longer than expected to get back to the airport as the bus was running only once an hour where he got off. Zach knew he missed several flights back to his base Texas. But that was okay for him as he walks up to the ticket desk; showing the woman his military I.D; Zach pulls up his phone to display a confirmation code that has her print him a priority ticket to the next available flight to Dallas.<br />
“Leave was cancelled,” Zach trying to make conversation as he waited for the attendant to print his boarding pass.<br />
“And so close to the holidays,” the attendant showing sympathy; “must be important to head back to Texas.”<br />
“Check your social media,” Zach not caring if he was violating orders; “get some place safe.” Zach hoisting his ruck sac as he watches the woman’s face turn ash. She was watching a video showing a man and a women turning into furies as they rutted with each other in the middle of a public square.<br />
He quick walks to the security check point and ignores the TSA agent as they summon him over.<br />
“My orders you prigs,” Zach shouting as he pulls up the papers that were printed; “so don’t even try to pull me over for a secondary!”<br />
The sight of a man in fatigues slapping down papers as he walks through the metal detector, setting off the alarms was sight. Many people waiting in line chuckled as the security agent looked flustered while many others swore for the line cutting. Zach didn’t care, his mood was short and he was in a hurry.<br />
<br />
“You’ll be the first to board once the plane arrives,” a member of the gate crew explaining to an irritated woman at the counter. Like Zach she was in her fatigues and was clearly short with having her leave cancelled. As soon as the gate crew person saw Zach approaching, the female solider turned around an grunted; “guess I wasn’t the only one to have leave cancelled.”<br />
“I was forty five minutes from getting home,” Zach dropping into the nearest chair; he had to check in his ruck sac as luggage. He didn’t mind as it was a chance to relax without hauling fifty pounds of gear. “Fort Hood in Texas,” Zach nodding at his fellow marine.<br />
“Same,” the woman grunting.<br />
“Private Owens,” Zach extending a handshake to the woman.<br />
“Lieutenant Rivers,” the woman refusing the hand shake; her rank causing Zach to jump too and salute his superior officer.  “At ease,” the woman waving him off; “but I will sit next to you as we have nothing better to do than wait. Next flight isn’t for another hour.”<br />
“Then I’m going to hit the head,” Zach getting up; “and then see if I can find a sandwich shop.”<br />
“Washrooms are that way,” Lieutenant Rivers pointing behind her; “and good luck with the sandwich shop.”<br />
<br />
***********<br />
<br />
Leaving the washroom, Zach looked around to see if he could get a bite to eat while he waited for his flight. Knowing that his ticket will not permit him an inflight meal; his commanding officer being his usual cheapness as a self-styled bean counter, Zach was going to be hungry by the time he got to Fort Hood and he had a sneaking good chance that the mess hall would be closed by then. Twenty four hours between eating is not something he wants to go through so he moans as he heads to the only option available. An overpriced coffee shop that sells bland roast beef sandwiches.<br />
“Better than nothing,” Zach mutters as he points to two of the pre wrapped monstrosities and paying for them. Thanking the barista as best he can, he walks back to his gate and plunks down. Noticing the Lieutenant was nowhere to be seen, Zach just assumes she headed to the restroom as he was getting some food. SO with a shrug, he unwraps one of the roast beef with bread and practically devours the first triangle in a single bite.<br />
<br />
“Someone is hungry,” Zach looking up to see as Lieutenant Rivers appears. He had to turn around as she practically snuck right up behind him.<br />
“I take it you had to use the washroom,” Zach biting into the second sandwich half. Unaware of the Lieutenant’s Cheshire like grin.<br />
“Something like that,” the woman smiling as her body shimmers; her military fatigues fading as her eyes turn green, her ear appear in her head and look rounded. A muzzle pushes out and whiskers form. Black fur explodes all over her body as a black tail whips out. The runes on her wrists glow as she finishes letting her Anthro black pathress fury form out. Flexing her hand paws to reveal sharp claws she tenses and jumps private Zach Owens as he stepped up to dispose of the plastic wrap, finishing his late lunch.<br />
<br />
“Ooooof,” Zach grunts as the wind was knocked out him. A large weight pressing on his back as he struggles to move. He then felt a single sharp claw dig into the back of his neck; feeling blood being drawn as he fights his unknown assailant. Unaware that is was Lieutenant that was pinning him down.<br />
“Hurry up and take him,” a female voice he recognized from behind him; “before security shows up.”<br />
“Get off me,” Zach fighting to break free; “you are in for a world of hurt for this.”<br />
“He is a feisty one,” another female voice purring; Zach recognizing this voice.<br />
“Lieutenant Rivers,” Zach starting to feel woozy; “is that you?”<br />
“Yes,” the woman purring as she get up; allowing Zach freedom to move; “and if you follow us, we’ll take you to a spot to enjoy yourself.”<br />
<br />
Zach looked at the naked Anthro Black Panthress that was once the Lieutenant and an Anthro female Jack Russel Terrier. He recognized her voice. It was the gate attendant.<br />
“You won’t need this,” the anthro pantress grabbing Zach’s phone and tossing it into the trash; “just follow us.”<br />
“Okay,” Zach unable to resist as the fury virus is effecting his mind; he saw the videos of people changing and he knew he was going to. He felt excited as the urge to remove his clothing came on him. The two females seeing him struggle pause to assist him. Ripping his uniform off and turning the scraps into ash with their runes as the rushed him into a private security office. They soon went to town on him. Rubbing their hand paws all over his body as he moaned. His erection at full mast as the panthress danced her rough tongue over the engorged phallus.<br />
<br />
“He’s ready,” the dog furry grinning as she guided him to the panthress’s open sex. Already on all fours and with her ass pointed up. Exposing her wet feline snatch to the private who’s head was awash with desire. Needing no further encouragement, Zach plunges into the waiting pussy. Moaning as he feels the tight tunnel squeezing him; he pants as he pulls out partway before plunging back in.<br />
<br />
“oooooooooh,” the panthress fury purs; feeling his hard shaft spear and spread her folds. Her body rocking to the rhythmic thrusting as her own orgasm begins to build.<br />
The jack Russell terrier fury helping Zach Owens along, she fondles his testicles as they begin to sprout a layer of soft white fur. The fur spreading all over his body as his chest broaden and his abdominal muscles become more well defined. His eye turn into a piercing shade of blue just as his ears push up to his head; becoming triangular, just as a muzzle pushes out of his face. He begins to speed up as a white furred tail bursts forth from his rear and his shaft develops a knot that the anthro panthress’s sex swallows; locking them in place and electing a yowl of pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Just let it go,” the dog fury gently whispering as she rubs her hand paws all over Zach new lupine body; lightly kissing his muzzle as he grunts, pressing his body close to Lieutenant Rivers has he feels his balls clench and his shaft explodes in pleasure.<br />
“Oh gods this is great,” Zach shouting as he feels his body shuddering as he pumps his seed into the female he is knotted too.<br />
“Told you he would be easy,” the Terrier Fury now staring at the Panthress fury as her eyes roll back and her tongue lolls out. Her mind is out of it as her orgasm is frying her brain. “Name is Ginger by the way. Just Ginger, the gate attendant wagging her tail.”<br />
“Zach,” The new anthro white furred wolf fury managing as he pants with pleasure. A satisfying smile upon his wolfish muzzle; he feels his orgasm fading. “So much for deployment,” he adds.<br />
“Stacy,” The anthro Panthress fury finally coming to her senses; “and gods that was awesome.”<br />
“My turn,” Ginger grinning; “just as soon as your knot deflates that is.”<br />
<br />
&quot;We should share this with the rest of the airport,&quot; Zach smiling as he wraps his hand paws around Stacy; placing them on her furry crotch, he moans ah he feels his shaft through her furry body.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not the only furies here in the airport,&quot; Ginger looking at a monitor and seeing the transforming TSA agents chasing and tackling airport patrons and other personnel.<br />
&quot;I was going to be deployed to keep this from happening,&quot; Zach looking up and watching a police officer getting his throat ripped out after shooting a fury dead.<br />
&quot;And if you did that,&quot; Ginger watching the second police offer getting killed as well as a federal agent who managed to pull a gun; &quot;you would be sharing their fate.&quot;<br />
&quot;I want to see,&quot; Stacy straining to look at the monitor; still tied to Zach and unable to get up. &quot;Why would they fight this,&quot; Stacy managing to see the aftermath. Human and fury bodies lying in the terminal entrance.&quot;Being a fury feels wonderful,&quot; Stacy looks away. The sight of seeing dead furies making her heart feel heavy.</p>
