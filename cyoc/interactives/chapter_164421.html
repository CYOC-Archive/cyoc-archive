<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing Tucker did when he got back to the apartment was set his stuff down and take off his shirt. He ran his fingers over his chest, but he didn&#39;t need to, the hair was growing in, about a quarter inch long at this point it still was only a patch in the middle of his chest, but he could see the line going from it down to the waistband of his pants. It also had a more diamond shape, as it was getting wider on level with his nipples. The stubble under his arms was promising as well, he was getting the itch to shave again but decided to wait until it had all grown back in.<br />
<br />
Sitting on his couch, he laid his purchase out on the table. Muscle powder, height pills, razor refills, and the box..<br />
<br />
Curiosity had never been something he had been able to resist, so he opened it up. Inside was an electric blue dildo. Only, other than the color, is was the most realistic looking dildo Tucker had ever seen, and put the one hidden in his dresser to shame. He picked it up and looked it over. It even had a ball sack dangling from it. Each vein was rendered on the surface, the head carefully sculpted, the ball sack had natural looking wrinkles. There was a weird bunching along the shaft, and it too Tucker a while to realize that was a foreskin pulled back, depicted in careful detail.<br />
<br />
It was hefty, ten inches long, and hard for Tucker to wrap his hand around, it felt like trying to hold a soda can. Bigger than any boyfriend he had had before, and bigger than any toy he had tried before. But he had a feeling that was what he had to do. He looked in the box and there was a hand written card. Test item indeed. He wondered if the neat, blocky handwriting was Locke&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;For anal use only. Liberally apply provided lubricant, insert until orgasm is achieved. Do not use with other lubricants. Sounds simple enough.&quot; He looked at the box, and hidden under the card was a cubby hole with a bottle of lube. &quot;Might as well get it over with.&quot; He placed everything back into the box and walked it into his bedroom where he stripped down.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t the first time he took a cock or dildo up the ass. Quickly, Tucker lubed it up and placed the head against his hole. Twinkish as he was, he was the perpetual bottom. Sometime he thought it would be nice to be the top, but he&#39;d never met anyone willing to let him try. But the thought fled his mind as he pushed the head inside of him. He gritted teeth, expecting pain as the thick monster split him in half. Instead, it spread him like nothing he had felt before, but there wasn&#39;t much in the way of pain, just a tingling. Maybe the lube helped numb some things? Either way, he found it much easier than expected to slowly insert the large dildo. Each inch sent waves of pleasure through his body. Whatever was numbing the pain did nothing to the pleasure, and he was honestly surprised when he felt the silicone testicles twice the size of his own slap against his leg.<br />
<br />
His own cock was standing at it&#39;s rigid four inches from the experience. Breathing heavily, Tucker just let it sit inside him for a while before sliding it halfway out then back in. He arched his back and let out a shivering moan. At this rate, orgasm would be quick. Like something was pushing him to it.<br />
<br />
He started up a steady thrusting. He didn&#39;t even have to touch his own cock, he was already leaking pre by the third thrust, and he could feel his balls churning by number six. He let out a deep moan of desire as his toes curled with the ninth thrust. Thrust number ten caused him to lose his seed, spraying small bursts of creamy white cum across his sheets. But it was like no orgasm he had felt before, it seemed to shoot straight through him, ever nerve in his body jolted for a moment, every muscle clenching.<br />
<br />
After a minute of heavy breathing he regained his thoughts. &quot;Well.. leave inserted until orgasm, check.&quot; He reached behind to grab it but it was gone. It didn&#39;t feel like it was inside him anymore, and there&#39;s no way that whole thing with the balls and the base he was holding disappeared inside of him. It must have fallen out. He rolled over and looked on the bed, then beside the bed. No.. it was gone.<br />
<br />
Then he felt a strange, not at all unpleasant, sensation in his crotch. Sitting up he looked down to see his balls swelling in front of his eyes. No.. not swelling, the skin wasn&#39;t getting taught. They were growing, sack and balls. Right there between his scrawny legs his balls were going from cherry tomatoes to chicken eggs. Extra large chicken eggs.<br />
<br />
This had been on his list, too, but he was too embarrassed to ask Locke quite yet. Looks like it had been taken care of for him. Balls enlarged, his cock started growing next. Four inches might have been small, but it looked average on his small body. But already his cock was looking huge and it was probably only six inches.<br />
<br />
It was getting thicker even faster than it was growing longer, quickly reaching the same thickness as the dildo. &quot;Wait.. don&#39;t tell me..&quot; Once his cock reached eight inches it was obvious. The veins on his cock had shifted, even the head had changed shape. Skin was growing o the shaft, slowly slipping over the back of the glans. Tucker reached out and slid the foreskin back. It was a different feeling, and one he kind of liked. There was no doubt in his mind though, now. His cock was becoming an exact copy of the dildo, only flesh instead of silicone.<br />
<br />
By the time it reached ten inches, the giant cock looked absolutely ridiculous on him.  It flopped up past his belly button, and was pretty much as thick as his scrawny arm. Hell, the blood going to it was making him light headed. Good thing he intended to get bigger. He breathed slowly, trying to divert his thoughts to things other than the giant rod of meat between his legs and it slowly began to soften, the foreskin completely slipping over the head. It didn&#39;t shrink much though, down to a seven inch meat monster that would make a bulge in his pants no matter how big he was. Getting to his feet, it was a strange feeling to have it flopping around in front of him, hanging halfway down his thighs, maybe more. It started getting hard again and he moved his thoughts on again. Then he noticed another scrap of paper in the box and pulled it out. This one was typed up, and read like a test advertisement. &quot;NuYu&#39;s special Custom Cock service. Design your very own cock exactly how you want it. Results guaranteed... Wonder who designed this one.&quot; Tucker thought maybe Locke.. maybe this was the clerk&#39;s thing.. He started feeling himself chub up again and stopped thinking about the sexy, stubbled salesman.<br />
<br />
Though distracted as he was, he hadn&#39;t noticed his hair had grown in more fully, the chest hair starting to curl a little. And a glance in the mirror showed a more connected beard. &quot;One or two more beard shaves should do it.&quot; Though the bush in his pits was better it still wasn&#39;t thick enough, but he should probably see how the hair looked on a bigger him before shaving again.<br />
<br />
So that left the height pills or the weight powder.</p>
