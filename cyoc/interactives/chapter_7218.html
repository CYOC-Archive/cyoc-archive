<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill Weaver whistled a merry tune as he undressed and then waited for the Doc to return and do his medical exam. As he sat on the exam table his view was of a room quite steril. No pictures, no window, not even a calander but just a light gray painted four walls. <br />
<br />
A gaze upward saw the average ceiling tiles, a florescent light, and oddly enough a vent fan like one he had in his shower at home. As Bill sat their the room had a chill to the air. A shiver ran down his spine as if from the cold or maybe he thought from the longing to begin whatever testing the Doc had in mind.<br />
<br />
The door opens as Doc enters followed by a nurse and in the doorway a large muscled man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we ready Doc? You brought your nurse, a tray of seringes and what is the big guard for, I won't bite!&quot; toyed Bill with the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please help our subject into the proper position on the examination table!&quot; ordered the Doctor. Bill laid back but the nurse coaxed him to stretch out over the full length of the table surface. As Bill watched the Doc tap and jiggle each seringe the big man walked into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Doc this is kind'a embaressing, me naked laying here and your nurse and guard looking at me!&quot; said Bill feeling a little more in the open than ever before.<br />
<br />
The Doctor smiled, &quot;Ignor the thoughts of being naked in front of these professional people. As time goes bye I'm sure any thought of nakedness will be less of a worry and might even become prefered. Now these first injections will cause a burning feeling, let me know if the feeling becomes a true pain.&quot; said the Doc.<br />
<br />
Bill propped his head up to watch as the first injection went into his right hip. Then the second went into his left hip. As the nurse pushed his head back to lay flat Bill's eyes widened as the third injection went into his neck. &quot;Hey Doc!&quot; said Bill as the big man guard slipped restraint straps over Bill's ankles, and the nurse did the same to his wrists, chest and forehead.<br />
<br />
Bill was feeling the heat form the injections as he watched the Doc jiggle down the red liquid in the small seringe that sported a longer than normal needle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Doc!&quot; started Bill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet now and hold very still, nurse hold his head, Franklin hold down his chest. This may hurt going in but within a second you will begin to have little worry over being naked for a long time to come!&quot; said the Doc witha odd grin.<br />
<br />
A sharp pain as the seringe poked into the side of Bill's left ear and was worked deep into the base of his skull. A whimper of pain and wonder as his thoughts and worries seemed to desolve away.<br />
<br />
&quot;There that's done, you can go back to your duties Franklin!&quot; odered the Doctor. &quot;Nurse stay here in case he has any early reactions to the serums!&quot; ordered the Doc as Bill lay looking up into space.<br />
<br />
Like a dreaming state but with his eyes open and hearing the discussion going on in the room and in the hallway. Bill wanted to ask or say things but his desire found no strength to make the urge a reality. He could move his lips but other than blinking, breathing, and normal body functions he laid there stiff as a board.<br />
<br />
At Last the Doc came back into the room. &quot;Mister Weaver, ah Bill, we will drop the formalities' and keep just your first name. Now Bill, remember that when I want you in the future all I need call out is your name Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, remember your name is now Bill!&quot; said the Doc a Bill's name bounced about in his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's alert and listening Doctor!&quot; says the nurse as she makes a close watch over Bill's reactions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good! Bill, Bill, I want you to think about some of what I tell you so that as it happens you won't be afraid. Primary is that from now on you will not wear any clothes. You will in time wear a head halter and then over time a host of leather straps which will guide your movements. During the next two weeks many changes will occur to both inner and outer parts of your body. As per the signed agreement you now are a long duration test subject. This means for all intent and purpose your home for years to come will be as a subject a property of the Research Center. As our experiment rolls along you will have little need or in time even less of a desire for such things a money and personal belongings.&quot; explained the Doc.<br />
<br />
Bill's eyes flared back at the Doc since this was a far cry from the suggested way he was to be treated. The odd notion of his being naked all the time and not feeling any oddity about it made him more puzzled yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;His blood preasure is elevated quite high, Doctor!&quot; said the nurse looking rather concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm yourself Bill, getting worried now won't change what is to occur! You signed your life into my keeping and along with it this fraile body to become part of my experiment. Now Bill, I want you to clear your mind of thoughts as I explain what will be the final and long term part of the testing.  First is the experiment itself! I injected your muscles, and lower lobe of the brain with special reproductionable serums. Over several weeks you should see a color change in skin, hair, and texture of both. Then soft tissue body parts with begin to grow in both size and contours. The redirecting of body growth to one of total change rather than simple cell replacement is the task of the serum injected into the brain.&quot; said the Doctor as he saw Bill's expression change from one of concern to a look of disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you are thinking, you'd never should have signed the contract, well worry not there Bill! Now is a time of looking forward to the end of your first year. A time to come when the serums and additional injections will guide the cell structure to make a new Bill out of this fraile human. Now think about this Bill, close your eyes tight and think on this and this alone! When you came here the many corrals filled with all types of animals, remember?&quot; asked the Doc.<br />
<br />
Slowly Bill slures out a &quot;Yeees!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You looked over the fence and saw cattle, horses, sheep, goats, hogs, and several types of African animals didn't you?&quot; asked the Doctor.<br />
<br />
Another slurred out, &quot;Yeesss!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are the experiment here, in time those animals will be sent on to their testing as you will replace them in a corral. As your body changes the manly form will fade and a strong and beastial animal will replace this fraile form which is you now. Since you are to be with us for a long time I have administered our newest serum. You Bill will be my newest triumph in the field of science. Then too you will be in a field of your own, a pasture where the many funtions of life will occur.&quot; said the Doctor as he prepared an additional seringe.<br />
<br />
Sweat poured from Bill's head as the serum and Doctor's explaination worked in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since you were to be one of our longest test subject I have removed all reformation factors from the serums. I would imagine that after say twenty plus years as part of the animal world there won't be much desire to return to humanity. The simple fact that as you are living the life of a Hackney stallion, it's pleasures will no doubt be the control factor for which you will want and continue to exsist there in. Now the secret is out, you are to be Bill the Hackney stallion! A medium size male of the Equine realm. We will over time see both wild manners of beast and times of compassion like human. I expect that as others before you the animal mannerism' lust, jealousy, feelings of domination, plus the innate lazyness which prevades both human and animals will govern the new you.&quot; said the Doctor as he called for the Guard to take Bill to a special place.</p>
