<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After frantically searching for the web-address for about 2 months, Kyle realized it really was a hopeless cause...the web-address he wrote down must have gotten thown away, and judging by all the various searches he tried, apparently the site no longer even existed.<br />
  <br />
Kyle sighed as he glanced down at his semi-flaccid cock and swollen testicles.  &quot;Well things could be worse.  I really shouldn't have gone back to that page titled 'Genitals&quot; on the website (geez...how did I lose that damn address!) and clicked on the 'Simply Big' package without knowing exactly what it would do.  Oh well, hindsight's 20/20...looks like I'm just going to have to learn to live with the consequences.  Let's see, based on what's happened to me so far, by the time I reach 18, my cock &amp; balls will certainly be way above average, but they should still manageable. Most likely I'll end up somewhere around 12 or 13 inches hard, probably about 7&quot; flaccid.  I'm definitely a little worried about the size of my balls though....I guess, worst case scneario, they'll end up slightly bigger than large hen eggs...and if that does happen, I'll just have figure out a way to live with them at that size. I really do hope they stop aching all the time though.&quot;   <br />
<br />
Realizing the girls that he'll be able to have sex with (once he loses his virginity that is) will most likely be limited due to his &quot;simply big&quot; size: Kyle's mind drifted a bit, and suddenly out of nowhere another thought popped into his head:  (Hell, if I can't find that many girls willing to have sex with me, I'm sure I could find plenty of hot guys that would love to!  I overheard my gay uncle Don telling a female friend of his once that all gay guys were major &quot;size-queens&quot;...which he said meant that they believe there's no such thing as &quot;too big&quot; when it comes to the male genitaila.) As this thought subsided, Kyle suddenly snapped out of the daze he was in.  &quot;Where the hell did that thought come from?  I'm not gay...I've never even had a gay thought before!&quot;  Still, Kyle found it strange that while he verbally was trying to convince himself how weird and fucked up it was, deep down it didn't really seem like a bad thing.<br />
<br />
A little stressed and unnerved by all the thoughts racing through his head, Kyle remembered that he had a small amount of pot hidden in his room that a friend had given him, so he took it out and started puffing away to help him relax a bit. Never actually having smoked pot before, Kyle ended up doing much more of it then was necessary for him to relax.  Now his head was feeling incredibly foggy, and as he glanced down toward his crotch, he realized how horned up he was as he watched his penis slowly starting to thicken &amp; stretch out to it's full 10&quot; length; also suddenly aware of the intense aching that had returned to his testicles.  In his pot haze, he tried to focus as he stared at himself intently.  It was probably just the pot fucking with his head, but his cock and balls looked much bigger than they had been.  Granted, over the the past 2 months he had been so obsessed trying to find that website, that even when he jerked off, he wasn't really paying attention enough to notice if he had grown any bigger; although if he actually was as big as he looked right now he definitely would have noticed it.  That realization was enough to convince him that his eyes were just playing tricks on him because he was high.  <br />
<br />
Kyle realized he had to take a piss, so with some effort, he stood up and stumbled toward the bathroom.  Again maybe it was just the pot, but his balls seemed to be hanging lower and felt heavier than usual as they flopped against his thighs.  He made it to the toilet to relieve himself but he was so fucked up that he got way more urine on the floor than in the toilet.  His stomach growled as he was turning to leave and that's when he spotted the fabric tape measure on the shelf that he used for measuring.  Just for the hell of it, Kyle decided to try measuring himself since he hadn't done it in a while.  Since the tape measure won't lie (as long as he is able to read the #'s) he figured it might also help clear the pot from his head when he sees how much the it had effected his judgement and perception.<br />
<br />
Kyle first wrapped the tape measure around his shaft which was still rock hard from earlier, to measure the girth...it certainly looked like it said 7.5&quot;.  Kyle tried recalling how thick he was 2 months ago when he last measured himself...(damn his balls hurt and even though he knew his eyes were playing tricks on him, when he looked at them in the mirror, they almost looked bigger than the 2 large hen eggs Kyle figured he would end up with over a year from now. Getting back to his girth measurment, he knew wasn't thinking all that clearly, but he was pretty sure he was about 5.5&quot; or maybe 6&quot; then. No, he must have been thicker than that, because he knew he was 5&quot; around before ever finding that website, and if after a year of growth he was only 1/2&quot; to 1&quot; bigger, then how could he have grown a full inch and half more in only 2 months!  No, he was sure he just wasn't thinking straight, so he decided to forget about it for now and measure his length, which he knew for sure was just a hair under 10&quot; the last time and was probably a little over that by now.  As he hefted his shaft with his left hand so he could measure it with his right, he noticed that it felt heavier in his hand and even though he was as hard as humanly possible, it seemed to curve down a bit from it's own meaty weight.  As Kyle stretched the tape measure down his shaft to the end and tried focusing on the number, he lost his balance.  While trying to regain his footing he stepped in the puddle of his own urine, slipped and started to fall.  Just before he did, his eyes finally zeroed in on the last # which was only a few marks shy from the very tip of his cock...in that split-second before he fell and knocked himself unconscious, a feeling of shock and disbelief quickly washed over him when he saw that instead of the 10&quot; mark he was expecting to see, it was a 12!!</p>
