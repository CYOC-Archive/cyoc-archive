<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer felt nothing. Even if she tried her best she couldn&#39;t. The adult side of Jennifer&#39;s brain was seeking for stimuli but her current body was too young to provide it. She hated her current self cursing how useless she was and how long she had to wait. She had experienced a lot of things of dark things as Jennifer couldn&#39;t sleep but kept pushing herself to feel something. Jennifer hated how young she was and wished to be old enough to sense something. Her mother didn&#39;t love her, school treated her like a dumb child and all her knowledge and skills were only working against her. She wanted to act rudely but knew deep inside that if she did the world would turn much worse. Jennifer&#39;s anger was building up as she wanted to throw a tantrum and unleash her verbal onslaught on everyone.<br />
<br />
She demanded the world to throw her a bone but Jennifer was too frustrated and was envious how her brother received the love she was supposed to have. Why did her mother ignore her first child and gave so much attention to Lukas. Jennifer stormed to the bathroom with handful of t-shirts and let out her anger in muffled scream. Hitting the fabric while she could heard the echoing sounds of her mother and grandma. The constant niceness was getting into her nerves and Jennifer wanted to split her head with her two arms. She clawed her own thighs in anger as there were scratch marks. She hated the curse. Slamming her tiny fists on the t-shirts while slowly exhausting her body in the bathroom floor. She remembered how the curse amplyfied the most stupidest things. She tried her best to return back to her &quot;bed&quot; but the exhaustion made her pass out.<br />
<br />
The next moment Jennifer came back to the reality was when she saw her mother greeting her on top of the toilet. Jennifer had grown older and saw that the cloth pile had followed her to the bathroom. Her eighteen old mother acted way too casually and teased her with a name &quot;Piss Goblin&quot;. Jennifer looked at her mother and slowly registered that she wasn&#39;t wearing that much clothing anymore beside the faded and broken t-shirt. What the hell had happened this time. Her mother didn&#39;t even wash her hands as she slammed the bathroom door shut. Jennifer&#39;s delirious raging had made her situation even worse as she hopped to the toilet to inspect herself from the sink&#39;s mirror. No-one had cut her hair in ages as it has been let go, the shirt she wore was similar to her own mother as it was as broken and cheap looking as possible. She looked tired and worn. Jennifer felt a bit dizzy and was sure that lack of nutrion was causing her to nap most of the day.<br />
<br />
Why did her mother call her a &#39;piss goblin&#39; but in the same second she knew why. The whole bathroom looked like a public toilet that hadn&#39;t been washed in ages. Sink had a lot of crusty and dirty bits and even the toilet&#39;s bowl looked more brown than white. Jennifer had zits all over her own body and face. She truly looked like a goblin kid. It felt like a small gut punch. She didn&#39;t choose this and as she looked her new &#39;bedroom&#39;. It seemed that she had been living there most of her life. Her nose had gotten used to the constant stank smell but she was sure that anybody else outside her house picked up her awful stench where ever she went. She hopped down to the bathroom floor and almost tripped as her legs felt weak. Jennifer was sure that she was lacking proper nutrition but as a silver lining she wasn&#39;t skin and bones, yet. Still the &#39;piss goblin&#39; nickname was making Jennfier unreasonably angry as she hated that name. Doubling the anger was the fact that her own mother called her that. It wasn&#39;t a jab anymore. It felt like a knife that was twisted inside Jennifer&#39;s heart. She hated how she couldn&#39;t just yell and scream at her mother. Jennifer made a promise to herself to unleash her inner beast if something really bad happened to her. Hitting the cloth pile to release the surface level anger out of her system.<br />
<br />
But in that same moment. Jennifer heard a small ghostly whisper in her ear. <br />
<br />
&quot;You can always transform or dare her...&quot; The eerie voice whispered it&#39;s words. Jennifer couldn&#39;t tell if it was a man&#39;s or woman&#39;s voice as it sounded like both. Was she starting to hallucinate? Had she always had that kind of power inside her? The ability to curse someone else... Jennifer thought about it as she walked to the living room.</p>
