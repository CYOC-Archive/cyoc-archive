<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Grace formally Kim played nice while Lisa grumbled about taking down her posters and clearing Grace’s desk which she had taken over as her own makeup desk full of different makes up and perfumes. She did a few small talk to her as well, playing the part of a new student, she lied about her home town saying she was from a big city the next state over so it would throw her off. She admitted that they where both in the same major and had almost the same classes as well. She wouldn’t be able to hide that come Monday. Then about the time Lisa would normally be walking out the door to go to some night club or bar with her friends it was instead Grace’s turn as she put on a simple black top and silver shorts and told her she was going to go explore the campus a bit and would be back later. <br />
<br />
She knew the Campus already and knew where her targets would be, she headed straight to the favorite nightclub/bar that Lisa and her friends always went to. Even at 8 pm when they first opened the line was around the block and everyone was dressed in their party gets up. She walked past them all and headed toward the bouncer. In her old body the bouncer would have laughed at her for skipping the line or even attempting to get in the place. This was the place for beautiful people, not the likes of her. Now he lifted the rope and let her skip the line, only checking her new ID as required by law. Once inside she found herself a place at the bar and waited. <br />
<br />
She actually had to wait longer then she thought, but while she waited no less then a dozen guys bought her drinks and she even got three or four drinks bought for her by women. She drank most of them, from what her mentors told her she could still get drunk, she wasn’t immune to it like some monsters, but she had a greater resistance. She was talked to by said men and women and she was one of the main focuses of the bar/night club. It took until almost 9:30 when Lisa, her five friends plus their boyfriends finally made it into the club.<br />
<br />
They took up a booth almost directly behind where she was standing at the bar, still with all the people surrounding her they failed to notice. Now was the time to strike, she excused herself to go to the bathroom and disappeared into a stall. Once in she pulled out her phone and selected all the photos she had of Lisa, kissing men other then her boyfriend of almost three years. Her boyfriend Stan went to a different college about 2 hours away and drove down every Friday to be with her, come Saturday Lisa would normally have a different guy. Now she personally had no issues with Stan or any of her bullies other boyfriends they had paid her no mind in high school like so many others but she did have an issue with Lisa. So once selected she did something the old Kim was too afraid to do, she sent every image to Stan. <br />
<br />
She walked out of the bathroom and reached the bar just as the fireworks went off. Stan began to yell at Lisa while she attempted to say the images where fakes. The yelling only grew as everyone turned to watch the yelling and even the music stopped playing as the DJ took note of the yells. The bouncers instead rushed to the fight.<br />
<br />
“You’re a whore, I can’t believe I went engagement ring shopping last weekend for you!” yelled Stan as Lisa’s eyes began to fill with tears and rage.<br />
<br />
“Well maybe if your dick wasn’t so small you could actually please a real women!” yelled Lisa at the top of her lungs as Grace stood back in the crowd and watched with a slight smile as her revenge started to take form. <br />
<br />
“You whore, you can’t even remember that we haven’t slept together yet?” growled Stan in rage, as realization crossed Lisa’s face, as Stan’s fist turned white for a moment in rage before he let go and spoke in a cold distance voice. “I am the grandson of a preacher and son of a politician; I believe in waiting until marriage, staying true to the one you are with and you are a whore. I hope whatever you call a soul is pleased with itself.”<br />
<br />
With that Stan turned and headed away leaving Lisa and her friends standing at the booth with the whole bar looking at them with a mixture of pity for the public display and some with no pity at all believing she had brought it on herself. Lisa fell into her chair and put her face into her hands and began to cry, for her part Grace couldn’t care less. Seeing Lisa crying should have brought some pity that would have been a natural reaction to seeing a fellow human in pain, for Grace it brought a smile as Lisa was now experiencing some of the pain she and her friends had inflicted on Kim for years. With her work done, she got one last drink and headed out the door as well.<br />
<br />
“Where to next?” she said as she stood outside the Night club.</p>
