<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake heard the door rattle and quickly grabbed a blanket he kept by his chair for cold evenings and threw it over his lap and legs, hiding them from view. Just in time, as Jake&#39;s roommate Drew wandered in. He was dressed in his gym clothes, and still a bit sweaty. Drew liked to jog between the dorms and the school gym.<br />
<br />
Jake and Drew weren&#39;t all that much alike, other than both being 18. Jake wasn&#39;t athletic, but was kind of nerdy. Drew on the other hand was in the school on a athletic scholarship for baseball. He was well-muscled and fit, he also wasn&#39;t all that interested in academia. It&#39;s not that the two didn&#39;t get along, they just weren&#39;t going to be friends. Jake tutored Drew, and Drew offered Jake workout tips, not that Jake put them too use all that often. Well, there was one sticking point. Jake was a complete horndog and always had women on the brain. Jake.. well Jake thought about Drew a lot.<br />
<br />
Drew pulled up the Chronivac and luckily it had scanned Drew when he came into the room. Jake pulled up the profile, angling his screen so his roommate couldn&#39;t see it.<br />
<br />
Drew was too busy stripping out of his gym clothes in prep to go take a shower. The man just wasn&#39;t shy about being naked, and Jake didn&#39;t think he would be either with a body like that. Nicely muscled, just a touch of blond body hair kept trimmed just so, he might be hairier later in life but at 18 it was just a dusting. His dick was only average, but his balls were like a pair of chicken eggs, and hung low.<br />
<br />
Drew pushed through the door to the bathroom that was shared between their dorm room and their neighbor. Four guys using the same bathroom was sometimes a nightmare, but it was better than the whole floor. Jake knew he had about ten minutes to set up his plan while Drew showered. Normally it would have been longer but it was Friday, and Jake would have a date. So no jerking off, he&#39;d be &#39;saving himself&#39; for later.<br />
<br />
First Jake made a quick change for himself. He set it so his new appearance was normal, at least for him. Altered so this is how he always looked.<br />
<br />
Then he brought up Drew&#39;s profile and the animal parts menu. It only took a few minutes to pick, but when he saw the option he knew it was the right one right away. Drew got the same treatment, this would be how he was, world altered to fit. He heard the shower shut off and after a few minutes the door to the bathroom opened, and he hit the button to start both changes.<br />
<br />
Drew came striding into the room, drying his hair with his towel, the rest of his body on display, mostly dried but still damp in places. Jake noticed with a smile that the blond hair on Drew&#39;s legs was looking particularly thick. His walking gait seemed awkward for a moment as his feet took on a new shape on his way over to his closet. He let his towel hang around his shoulders as he browsed through his clothes.<br />
<br />
At one point he picked up one foot and then the other, but when he set them back down he stayed on his tiptoes, his heel having become long and narrow. The parts of his feet he was left standing on looking more and more like paws. His nails turning into thick, blunt claws as his toes rearranged and shifted about. Down his shins and his feet, his blond hair was now more like a shaggy fur. Fur that was growing up slightly thicker thighs. A bit of golden fuzz grew in on his butt, but much like Jake, there was no tail to be seen.<br />
<br />
Drew picked out a few things and tossed them on his bed. Giving Jake a nice view of the next change. Drew&#39;s dick was turning red, the base growing thicker as the head thinned to a point. Drew absent mindedly gave himself a little tug as a sheath grew around the base, but a thick knot tat was swelling at the base of his cock was keeping it exposed. &quot;C&#39;mon. Down boy. We&#39;ll get you something tonight.&quot; Jake blushed slightly and Drew grinned at him. &quot;What, we&#39;re both guys here, and I&#39;ve seen that monster of yours. I&#39;m telling you man, come with me to the gym, we&#39;ll get your top half matching that horsey bottom and you&#39;ll have to fight them off with a stick, or your dong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake felt himself blushing even harder, but it was confirmation that his changes were know part of reality. Golden fur grew in over Drew&#39;s pendulous balls as his cock finally slipped back into it&#39;s fuzzy sheath. He now had a set of Golden Retriever legs complete with doggy dick. It looked good on him, the golden fur complementing his blond hair, and slightly darker blond chest hair.<br />
<br />
He pulled on a tank top, black and tight, that hugged his muscles, then a blue button up he left hanging open. Finally a pair of shorts tailored for beast legs were pulled on and hid that plump sheath from Jake&#39;s view. One of his many baseball caps was placed on his head. &quot;How do I look?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake just gave a thumbs up, and Drew shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should come out with us. Just me, Mike, and Fred. We&#39;re going downtown, to this club specifically for &#39;Tyrs. The girls there all love &#39;em.&quot; Drew smirked. &quot;Horsey bits like yours would be a hit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake blinked a few times. He altered the world twice in quick succession to accept both him and Drew, but  he didn&#39;t think on that. &#39;Tyrs. He knew that term, short of Satyrs, the term used for men with animal legs and cocks. In altering the world he had made a genetic condition, he knew about it, too, of course he would, he had it. About 1 in 10 guys changed during puberty, never affected women. He also knew Mike and Fred were two others on the baseball team with that condition, with Drew they were the only three on the team with it, Mike has some sort of feline legs, and Fred was a little more exotic, he was reptilian. Mammals were most common, but other things did spring up.<br />
<br />
Jake glazed out for a moment as the information he knew but didn&#39;t know went through his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s called Legs. They even let you take your pants off in the back rooms.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake blinked a few times and looked at Drew. &quot;Legs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The club. C&#39;mon, get out, live a little Jakey.&quot; Drew sat on his bed, arms folded on his knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t we a little young to get into a club?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fake IDs, bro. I have one you can use, I used it when I was a junior in high school before I bulked up. Hair color is wrong but people dye that.&quot; Drew was already over at his dresser, shuffling through things as if Jake had agreed.</p>
