<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hilda has always stuck out as an oddball to Felix. Sure, she has gotten along well with the rest of the Biscord server, even providing some therapeutic advice when some members were frustrated with their lives. It certainly displayed her mature, almost motherly, personality, but no one really knew much else about her. She tended to shy away from personal questions and deleted selfies of herself. Even Openheimer disclosed his adventures and hobbies, such as wakeboarding, with the server. Considering that this server mainly housed a gay community, Hilda almost seemed out of place, and yet she fitted right in the everyday conversations.<br />
<br />
Felix decided that he would test the app on Hilda. Not only will he verify the app&#39;s true ability, he could also gain some insight on Hilda, those of the first-person variety, Felix would add. After opening the app on his phone, he closed his eyes and focused on Hilda&#39;s blond hair and her smooth face, the only features he could muster. &quot;I don&#39;t know if that is enough, but then the app did promise that it would work with the &#39;archaic&#39; internet,&quot; Felix thought. Fortunately, he felt himself being lightheaded, as he was slowly stripped of his senses. It was like being in a very foamy bath, or feeling the zero gravity like when Felix visited his university&#39;s physics building. But this feeling was much more intense, as he also felt himself moving at a very fast speed. On this &#39;philosophical&#39; journey of sorts, he heard the female voice from before, explaining that his own body would be kept on stasis and that his host body would not be aware of his &quot;invasive&quot; existence. &quot;Well, that&#39;s nice, if it was mentioned earlier!&quot; he thought. Of course, he was at the mercy of whatever was at the end of his journey. Soon enough, he felt himself stop cold, as if the conductor of this journey forgot how to brake. He was slowly immersed in a warm skin, with his normal senses returning, reaffirming that he was indeed still alive. For a moment, Felix thought the world stood still with a soft breeze caressing his skin, as if nothing had happened.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that sensation was cut short, as Felix felt dizzy, very dizzy. Not enough to be nauseous, but it felt like a heavy weight has been placed on his head. As Felix kept his eyes closed to ease the pain, he attempted to rub his head, only to feel long strands of hair flowing down. It felt smooth and smelled nice with a soft fragrant scent. <br />
<br />
Opening his eyes in shock, he saw himself come face-to-face with a desktop screen, which happened to be the only source of illumination in the room. Even with the dim light, Felix could tell that he was in an office of some sort, similar to his dad&#39;s that he would visit during Bring Your Child to Work day. Computer and desks were neatly organized in rows in this large room. All of the screens were turned off except for the one in front of him. And just as expected, no one else was around, as Felix was just greeted with a soft whirr of the air conditioning and the pit-pat splattering of rain on the windows beyond. <br />
<br />
Wait, rain? And night? But it was a sunny afternoon just moments earlier. Felix glanced at the clock on the computer screen, realizing that it displayed 1:25 AM. That wasn&#39;t the only odd thing, as the screen in front of him showed various spreadsheets and reports. Of course, he could not make sense of it all. But it definitely reminded him that he was no longer in his familiar dorm. He might not even be in the US, for all he knew.<br />
<br />
Glancing down on the desk, Felix saw a smartphone in a pink case displaying the Biscord server. With his now dainty hands, Felix scrolled through the text, confirming that it was indeed the Lemon Club, but with Hilda&#39;s account. Exiting the app, Felix opened the camera app to reveal his face. The screen displayed the face of a young brunette with clear skin and light make up. Some of the make up did wear off though, most likely due to time. The face also showed signs of fatigue, consistent with what Felix was feeling. Curious as to where he was located, Felix opened the Maps app only to reveal that he was somewhere in the Philippines. &quot;Philippines?&quot; he exclaimed, surprised that he was located on the other side of the globe. But perhaps more surprising was his voice, which sounded more feminine than he expected. Felix slid back in shock, feeling his heavy chest for the first time. Having pulled back from the desk, Felix took a through account of his new body, noting that his distended chest was barely contained within the white button up shirt he was wearing. Even the lapels of the outer black jacket was stretched to fit those protrusions. Felix had got his first sense of the undergarment beneath, softly cupping those breasts into a taut form. Underneath, Felix felt his smooth legs wrapped in a soft nylon, enjoying the peculiar feel. They were mostly exposed to the cool air, save for his upper thigh, which was barely covered with a tight black skirt. His ankles were propped up with stilettos. Overall, this business attire certainly wasn&#39;t something Felix would wear. <br />
<br />
So Felix was stuck in an extremely unfamiliar body in a foreign environment in the middle of the night. </p>
