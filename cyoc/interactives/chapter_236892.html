<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Dunno what inspired me to write this... but yeah a more rippy shreddy type of violence with some fetish tf&#39;s sprinkled on top</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin got to his seat on the front quickly as he walked past the cheerleaders, a few jocks, some nerds, and then... *thud* Ty had been looking for it but the two bitches semi-near the back... They&#39;d occasionally do something like make Ty step in gum, get covered in chip dust, or get Ty tripped... The only interaction Ty had with them was just walking to his seat on the bus, so he&#39;d get to get over them even if his day would start on the wrong foot. He still hated them, and not the smoldering hatred he had towards his step-family that was a near constant. It was a quick sharp- &quot;AAAAHHHHHHH!!!&quot; One of the bitches screamed and as Ty looked up he could see one of the bitches covering their belly as a long sharp gash had cut across their body ripping not only their shirt but also their flesh. People, especially Dustin, started to look but as Ty picked himself up the gash was gone. The first bitch was patting her body in shock as the intense pain of being torn by reality itself had vanished along with the wound. Second bitch&#39;s eyes were also wide in shock meanwhile everyone else didn&#39;t notice... except for maybe Dustin. <br />
Ty felt a little empowered as he took his seat near the back where no one was watching the guy who got tripped and usually just stared out the window. Ty in fact let his face stare out of the window as he could feel his consciousness leave a little. Some aura, essence, what have you moving and preying on two bitches. The mystical energy Ty projected was creeping around the two. <br />
<br />
Sarah was still panting a bit but calming own &quot;I wasn&#39;t crazy right... It felt like... some sword or something...&quot;<br />
Anna nodded &quot;I saw the gash too-&quot; The bitches weren&#39;t pretty, they weren&#39;t popular, they were just petty but maybe if they had something to show~ Anna then felt a pressure in her chest as her breasts started expanding but oddly. They didn&#39;t seem to grow that visibly bigger at first as Ty was being mean. In fact at first they seemed to have shrunk as Ty compressed Anna&#39;s breasts with a ghostly energy wall. However her breasts grew and grew as they pressed against the wall. Anna tried clawing at her shirt or bra to try to relieve the pressure, but as she pulled her neckline down Sarah and Anna saw Anna&#39;s breasts growing compressed against air. &quot;Please stop it~&quot; Anna moaned in a mixture of pleasure and pain as Ty had cranked up the erogenous parts of Anna&#39;s breasts. But it wouldn&#39;t stop as Anna&#39;s breasts grew and grew... till they were completely blocking Anna&#39;s sight forward as her breasts spilled all over the energy... and then Ty let the breasts go as they instantly filled and nearly broke her bra and shirt... Ty&#39;s energy form&#39;s hands turned to claws as they grabbed Anna&#39;s clothed breasts, squeezed, and dragged the claws forward leaving cut marks on Anna&#39;s breasts and the clothes around her chest in ribbons. Anna was tearing up as energy Ty grabbed Sarah&#39;s head and slammed her to the ground pinning the bitch. Ty then started shredding Anna&#39;s clothing leaving several lacerations over her fine body before grabbing Anna&#39;s hair and pulling the blonde locks. Yanking painfully the hair before draping it over the girl&#39;s body to preserve modesty... and then the hair started fusing to the skin till the locks turned into fur. The Bitch&#39;s face turned into a muzzle, her tongue lengthening till it spooled out of her tongue and out onto the floor letting her taste the dirt and metal of the bus floor. The energy Ty was enjoying yanking around her facial features like dragging her ears hard to the top of her head, Jabbing most of the colors out of her eyes... and for the tail grabbing onto the vestigial one that humans had and YANKING AND YANKING AND YANKING on it till it was about the right length. Ty then draped the now furry human in a &quot;service animal&quot; uniform with a leashed collar. No one else but Dustin seemed to notice as Sarah tried to say something, but as her vocal chords almost started working Sarah seemed to see the energy Ty. It didn&#39;t look like Ty but some sort of shadow rippling with energy, it&#39;s very being sharp to the touch. The demon looked Sarah in the eyes as she could feel it&#39;s sharp fingers make it&#39;s way down her throat till it touched her voice box... There was a tear in Sarah&#39;s eye as the demon stared at her and then relented. Dragging it&#39;s fingers out of her throat but there was an understanding that Ty&#39;s vindictive side enjoyed a lot more. She could keep her voice, but speak once and it&#39;d be shredded. <br />
<br />
The Bus stopped at the school, many got out, and then the Bitches went out... That dumb freak of a furry looking girl who was only good for a service animal, and that giant boobed ditz whose boobs weren&#39;t even that great since they dragged everywhere leaving them with so many scratches and blemishes. Dustin was scared that Ty might turn against him like that. Meanwhile Ty took a bit to get off the bus as he felt... Unreal. he was mostly there but could feel more of himself dwelling within that Bitch Sarah. She try to stand on two legs and he&#39;d slash her tendons till she remembered she was a quadruped, Try to use her thumbs and he&#39;d bend and drag them till they were dew claws, Try anything smart and his claws would rake across her brain taking whatever IQ she had along with who knows how many memories or personality. Plus that demon could also swipe out and mess with Anna still. <br />
Now Ty felt heavy. He tried lightening himself, giving himself muscles, giving every physical advantage, but after having donned a form of pure omnipotence nothing Ty could give himself corporeally was going to cut it anymore... Still Ty felt like he shouldn&#39;t abandon his body too quickly just yet... It was a tether, and his body and mortality gave him desires... he wasn&#39;t sure he should divorce his essence from his humanity yet. Ty shrank back down to normal as his frustration continued to fester. He had been so powerless and yet now... <br />
Ty sensed behind him and saw his energy in the shape of claws scraping against the concrete and dirt behind him and attention was being drawn... A thought later and the damage was repaired and no one was paying attention. Ty tried to take a deep breath as he went into school. He was pissed off and felt like destroying any or everything in sight... but he couldn&#39;t... shouldn&#39;t. His morality and humanity were telling him to at least try and calm down, that those violent tendencies from being granted power needed to be curbed or worked out. He couldn&#39;t keep lashing out instinctively and then patching up the damage with immortality forever... shouldn&#39;t...</p>
