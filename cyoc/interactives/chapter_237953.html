<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ian was now a golden lab, just like daisy. Sprinting across the yard he spotted the neighbor boy Jillian out playing basket ball in his driveway, human thoughts leaving he had a huge instinct to grow the pack. And looking at Jillian his balls tightened and chilled his long tongue now hanging out of his mouth. He could’ve passed as any other dog. He ran and tried to mount the boy, Jillian screamed a dog just came of the blue and was trying to rape him?! What! Ian must’ve noticed that the boy had pants on and this wouldn’t work because he backed up and then lunged to bite Jillian on the arm, just enough to draw blood and coat with saliva. The boy ran into his house through the garage with the dog following close behind and sneaking through the door knowing his prize. He chased the boy to his bedroom door where the boy was finally able to shut the door and keep him out. He felt hot! Sweaty! Was this dog ill? What’s going on?  Was he having an allergy attack? He got his answer fast, he became aware of a deep burning sensation in his groin like passion. He still grabbed his epi pen and put it in his pocket just in case he had lost the cap unfortunately, but didn’t think he would activate it. So hot he stripped to his boxers, sweating and breathing hard, he noticed hairs growing on his body, and watched his dick change shape into a canine sheath right in front of his eyes his new prick now pointed and sliding out of a thick sheath with two furry balls beneath it, Jillian to his horror understood, he wanted to be bred, he wanted to change, but he was also fully aware none of this should be happening. Almost against his higher will he walked like a zombie towed his door raising his hand to open the knob, to the scratching dog in the other side, the dog tore open the door as soon as he got a small crack and walking around to Jillian’s hiney he began licking deep inside making the boy moan, the boy staggered and fell over facing the other direction the new virus hormones taking over, as ian mounted him, spraying his backside with pre unable to find the hole at first, the boy hesitated at guiding him because he wasn’t even sure if he wanted this. Soon he found his hole and began humping away the boy never having anything up his ass before shouting in an odd feeling and pleasure, curled up on the ground on top on his old shorts the dogs dick dripping puppy pre from his bumhole as he plowed it dripping down his balls and off the tip of his penis mixing with his own fluids before collecting on his shirts below, as he felt new pleasures he curled up more and felt something building, suddenly his hand slipped and sharp pain hit him in the groin he had accidentally activated his epi pen, taking a deep breath feeling winded as he tried to catch his breath his orgasm began it was much more intense almost like the pen made it stronger waves of pleasure rocketed from the dog knot pressing against his prostate feeling like he was going to pee he grunted and pisses cum for a soft moment and starting pining from the base of his new tail to the top of his head grew a layer of fur and his penis changed to that of a dogs. He felt the knot it even felt like it was still getting bigger but his transformation had stopped where he was at. Half human half dog, even observing his fingers they were thicker almost paw like but still usable as fingers. Feeling the warm seed pour into him he did his best to relax. He was still enjoying this, albeit it all was so weird. He quickly got an idea, knowing it wasn’t sanitary but what the hell this thing raped him, …kinda. Wondering if this dog had been a person before too he took his epi pen turned it to a new dose and stick it in the golden labs hind leg, making the dog yelp, and as he expected cum again hard still inside him the pressure actually beginning to make his belly hurt. The gels became more of a human aaahhhhh as the form of a hairy dog like boy appeared on his back in a few seconds still shooting cum into Jillian’s ass every beat of his heart, who are you, I’m so sorry I can explain, recognizing the voice he said Ian! What the fuck, he said I have no idea just like you one minute I was normal the next I wanted to fuck my dog then I was a dog, I never thought that would happen! You fucked your dog? Well you were fucked by a dog, good point he said. He turned over to face Ian his knot keeping them locked together ya know I’ve always kinda liked you, I wouldn’t rather it have been anyone else, that was kind of fun! Ian blushed as Jillian brushed his finger against his face. He was still cumming he could feel his butthole clench with each spurt. This was so intimate he never imagined this with Jillian, after some time they separated and figured since it was contagious, they would go and check on the others to make sure everyone else is fine. Both their penis’s retracting into their sheaths. <br />
Returning to Ian’s house…</p>
