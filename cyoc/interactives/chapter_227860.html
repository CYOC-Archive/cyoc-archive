<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jimmy Proudhoof wanted another cup of coffee after he devoured the bacon, eggs and toast he, his twin brother and father made for breakfast. He gave his mate Alison a sour look when she wouldn’t let him; stating medical mumbo jumbo as far as he was concerned; too much caffeine along with the aspirin he took was not good for dealing with a hangover. Instead she made him have some orange juice after breakfast; the sweet juice did help perk him up some, but that moment he stepped outside Jimmy groaned as the brightness from the freshly fallen snow made his splitting headache feel worse.<br />
“Your fault for drinking all that egg nog last night,” Jake not letting an opportunity to razz his twin brother; them both grabbing the shovels Jimmy had in the garage while their father blazed a path to Edward Heartpaw’s house next door. They watched as their half-sister pounced out of the home and tackled their father; causing the surprised anthro stag-deer fury to tumble into a nearby snow drift.<br />
<br />
The twins chuckle as Roxy begins to bounce around; jumping into the snow and throw pawfuls of it up into the air as their dad gets up. A few moments later both Roxy and Jimmy J.R come bounding towards Jake and Jimmy S.R as they begin to dig out the massive snow blanketing the driveway.<br />
“Uhoh,” Jake seeing the feline furies half running and half jumping through the snow; “we got trouble coming.”<br />
“It’s nothing we can’t handle,” Jimmy squinting; doing his best to look happy despite the splitting headache. He scoops up some snow with his shovel and flings it to the cougar and tigress cubs; he chuckles as the snow lands squarely on the two, causing the cubs to stop in their tracks. “Ready yourself brother,” Jimmy getting another scoop of snow; “we got ourselves a snow fight brewing.”<br />
<br />
The battle was short and fierce as both Jimmy J.R and Roxy did their best to fend off the barrage of snow coming their way. Being brought to the point of defeat, the two cubs managed to rally once Michael and Edward joined the fray to help gang up of the twins. As soon as the cubs were covered in snow, Alison and Brittany step outside to call the two to come in and warm up. Roxy and Jimmy J.R needing no further encouragement, the two cubs who were starting to shiver from the cold despite their thick fur coats came running towards the outstretched offer of toast and juice once dried off.<br />
 “How come Adam didn’t come out,” Jimmy S.R noticing Edward finally joining them; a shovel in his paws as well as an extra in Michael’s.<br />
“He woke up feeling unwell,” Edward sighing; “I guess yesterday’s fun in the snow gave him a cold.”<br />
“Ah shit,” Michael shaking his head; “that mean’s Roxy might get sick as well; she got chilled from her tobogganing fun yesterday.”<br />
“She and junior might have it already,” Edward looking sympathetic as he began to help clear is son in law’s drive way; “The three slept together last night. Curled up under a sheet to help keep in body heat.”<br />
The four made quick work of Jimmy S.R’s driveway and adjoining sidewalk; heading to Edwards patch of concrete, they took slightly longer as his vehicle was in the garage and they had more driveway to shovel. Michael then starts his car to warm it up while he busily clears off the snow, he looks at his sons and beckons them to join him.<br />
“We still got a restaurant to clean,” Michael grinning; “but I think that can wait.”<br />
“What do you have in mind dad,” Jake looking confused; putting the shovel blade down in the snow bank as he sees in the distance a fury using a gas powered snow blower to make quick work of his driveway.<br />
“We clear out you driveway, then help Lucas and Rachael clear out theirs.”<br />
“And then yours,” Jimmy groaning; the stag-deer fury realizing that he has more snow to shovel out; “I guess that means Roxy will have to stay here for the time being?”<br />
“She’ll be fine,” Michael smiling; “and assuming the parking lot isn’t so bad, we might be able to dig out some cars left abandoned from last night’s party.”<br />
<br />
Sipping on a hot cider, Alison watched as her Mate, his twin brother Jake along with her fox fury father and Michael set off to dig out driveways and collect wayward vehicles. In fact she noticed her neighbors across the street also using shovels and snow blowers to also clear out their driveways as well as each other. Everyone was lending a helping paw to dig out of the surprise snowstorm that struck the Pacific Northwest. She turns around to see Brittany on her phone; the anthro wolf fury face chatting with her twin cubs as they wonder when she is coming to pick them up.<br />
“You let your grandfather know that the Calvary is coming to dig you out,” Brittany speaking; “just relax and stay warm, your father and I will come to collect you once the roads are at a more manageable state to drive on.”<br />
“Brittany,” an anthro lioness fury stepping into view; “should I get something warm for the calvary? And do you know when they will arrive?”<br />
“Yes to the first mom,” Brittany answering; “as for the second, I think our house will be tackled first. So expect them around noonish.”<br />
“Well it’s a good thing I made lots of chili yesterday,” Rachael nodding to her daughter’s quick response; “I’ll let Lucas know so as not to pull a muscle trying to clear the driveway by himself.”<br />
“You tell dad to stay safe,” Brittany smiling; “and keep Dusk and Dawn from spending too much time outside. It’s really cold out there.”<br />
<br />
Brittany hangs up the call and looks at her friend Alison; the sound of cubs upstairs playing in Jimmy J.R’s room makes the female fury smile ruefully.<br />
“I know that look,” Alison putting down her cider and summoning a vibrating dildo; “don’t expect me to be gentle just because I’m pregnant.”<br />
“You best cast a soundproof bubble to keep the cubs from hearing,” Brittany spreading her legs; giving Alison a clear view of her vulva as it starts to glisten with lubricating fluids; “I have a feeling I’m going to be a noisy wolf.”<br />
<br />
“You horny bitch,” Alison grinning; her feline fangs bared as she approaches the eager wolf, her runes glowing brightly as she summons a bubble to cancel out the lust filled moans as well as to temporarily black out the windows. “Don’t want any looky loos,” Alison growling as she turns on the vibrator and slowly inserts it in Brittany; hearing the female wolf fury howl as she expertly work the artificial phallus into her tight tunnel. The anthro cougar quickly working Brittany to moan and squirm as she knows all of the wolf’s pleasure buttons to push. Hearing her pant and moan, followed by an ear piercing scream; Alison smiles as she pulls the vibrating rod out, she eagerly licks the shaft clean and then gets down to clean up the mess between her legs. Brittany still enjoying her orgasm, shivers as she feels Alison’s rough feline like tongue lap up her honey within her folds.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck, how I miss that tongue of yours,” Brittany feeling another orgasms building; “keep eating me out my wicked kitty, I think I’m about to squirt again!”<br />
Alison doesn’t respond except for a deep throaty purr as she continues her ministrations; her own sex starting to feel damp despite being five months pregnant. She chooses to bring Brittany to another crescendo by nipping on her clitoris; hearing her screams as she gets a muzzle full of more honey spraying her. Alison pulls back licking her lips clean; giving Brittany a longing look as she lays down on the floor, spreading her legs to reveal her own honey soaked entrance.<br />
“I suppose I owe you,” Brittany getting the hint as she crawls off of the couch to give the anthro cougar fury a reciprocating act of cunningulus.<br />
<br />
Denise giggled as she watched Brittany work Alison’s feline sex slowly as she finished her coffee. The carnal act of two female furies committing lesbian acts of lust, got her feeling randy. Slinking towards the two on silent paws, she surprises Alison as she squats above her muzzle; her tigress sex millimeters from her muzzle.<br />
“Can I join in,” Denise lowering her sex onto a muzzle panting from sexual stimulation; not giving Alison a chance to respond as she proceeds to massage the cougar’s swollen breasts. Chuckling as breast milk starts to leak out from the erotic stimulation; Denise soon gasps as she feels her sex being nibbled on, Alison’s tongue dancing around the outer and inner labia. Denise soon whimpers as she blasts out a spray of her juices; her orgasm coming quick as Alison was efficient when it came to oral satisfaction.<br />
<br />
“To think,” Alison finally having a chance to speak after at satisfying orgasm was achieved despite being five months pregnant; “it took a snow storm to get a surprise lesbian three way going.”<br />
“You rest up Alison,” Brittany getting up; eying the tigress fury with a wolfish hunger; “I think Denise needs a lesson in oral pleasure.”<br />
‘Like I need a lesson from you,” Denise grinning; baring her teeth as she tensed up, ready to pounce on the horny wolf who clearly wants another round.<br />
“Make it quick you two,” Alison getting up on shaky legs; her body still quivering from Brittany’s expertise, managing to make it to the couch that still has some of Brittany’s juices staining the fabric. “I don’t want to leave the cubs unattended for too long,” Alison reminding Brittany and Denise as the two engage in an energetic and furious act of sixty nine.</p>
