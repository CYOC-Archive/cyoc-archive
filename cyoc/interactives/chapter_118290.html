<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As most of Moon Lake was dealing with the wedding between Jennifer Harper and Harold Jenkins that Halloween morning in hopes that the confrontation between the estranged members of the Harper family and one Dieter Wilhelm from Alabama didn&#39;t result in the secret existence of weres being revealed*, the other Harold Jenkins of this small town awoke for the day.<br />
It was no surprise any more to see furry arms and paws as he stretched and yawned, for Harold was fast becoming accustomed to being a weretiger. In fact, a part of him was wondering why he was ever hesitant in gaining a fursona to begin with.<br />
But exactly where he was turned out to be a bit of a puzzle for a moment.<br />
The sheets and pillow cases in the king sized bed were rich and felt silky against his fur. The comforter bunched up under his feet seemed thick and cozy.<br />
It wasn&#39;t until he saw the beautiful weretigress smiling down at him that Harold Jenkins realized where he was.<br />
Exactly where he wanted to be.<br />
&quot;Good morning darling,&quot; he said, smiling at his fiance, Virginia McCoy, who was laying on her side, propped up on one elbow with her paw under her chin, staring at him.<br />
&quot;Good morning to you to, my love,&quot; said Virginia in return, before lowering her head to kiss him.<br />
Muzzle to muzzle kisses took a bit of time to adjust to, but Harold had always been a fast learner and was now enjoying every moment of them.<br />
Virginia and his muzzles not only were pressed together as closely as they could be as they expressed their passion and love for each other, but Harold got a little extra thrill out of the fact that their respective tongues danced back and forth in each others mouths in an intimate embrace of their own.<br />
<br />
When their muzzles finally parted, Harold asked, &quot;What time is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;A little after 8:30. Did you sleep well?&quot;<br />
&quot;During what little sleep I got, yes. I seem to recall this lovely and very horny weretigress wanting to make wild, passionate love to me most of the night after we had this huge venison dinner.&quot;<br />
&quot;Funny. I don&#39;t recall you ever complaining about that,&quot; replied Virginia.<br />
&quot;Why should I?&quot; he asked in return, before Virginia lowered herself closer to him to embrace Harold. &quot;How long have you been up?&quot;<br />
&quot;Long enough to stare at the love of my life and appreciate how lucky I am to not only have the man of my dreams, but realize that we have a bright and sunny future together ahead of us now that I&#39;ve been cleared of any suspicions of possibly violating Statute 1A**.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, you know I wouldn&#39;t of pressed charges. In fact, my life has gotten a whole lot better now that I&#39;m furry.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? How so?&quot; wondered Virginia.<br />
&quot;I have you in my life and heart now,&quot; replied Harold, before wrapping his arms around his fiance and initiating another kiss.<br />
When their muzzle lips parted, Virginia stared at him and said, &quot;In many ways darling, I&#39;m the lucky one, and I&#39;m not just talking about my recent brush with the law either.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
&quot;Since I don&#39;t want there to ever be any secrets between us, and I already know the basics of your history, I want to tell you mine briefly,&quot; said Virginia, before laying her head upon Harold&#39;s furry chest. &quot;I&#39;ve been a weretigress for about 10 years now. When I first moved to Moon Lake to start my teaching career after earning my degree, since it was just me, the Mandatory Were Law didn&#39;t apply, although I did sign the town&#39;s non-disclosure agreement.&quot;<br />
&quot;If they had offered us that option when we first moved here, Melissa and I would have gladly signed that,&quot; commented Harold.<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; replied Virginia, raising her head to look at him. &quot;Anyway, for a while I was happy as a normal among were society. Everything was new and exciting, especially to this history teacher. A whole, unknown society to learn about?&quot;<br />
&quot;I can imagine,&quot; said Harold.<br />
&quot;Then I met this man, who also happened to be a weretiger, and I&#39;m sure you can guess how that turned out,&quot; she added, while holding up a paw for both of them to look at.<br />
&quot;But considering you&#39;re with me now, let alone my bride to be, I imagine things didn&#39;t work out between the two of you, for which I&#39;m glad,&quot; said Harold, before kissing Virginia on the tip of her nose.<br />
&quot;True. But the romance was brief and only one sided. In the end I found out he was kind of like a male Alice Decrux. After the sexual conquests, but not wanting the cash from having children,  nor the desire for any of the responsibilities involved in having a wife and kids, let alone the fact that l-o-v-e was only a 4 letter word to him. It took me a while to get over the heartbreak,&quot; added Virginia with a sigh. &quot;I was still a weretigress though. That&#39;s forever, but I was always lonely and still looking for the one thing a weretigress truly needs more than anything else in her life: a mate. Thankfully, I still had my teaching career and I did make some friends among the pride members too. Some of the hunts and the post pride meeting orgies have been fun, yet in the end it&#39;s just sex. But with you it&#39;s different Harold,&quot; she said, rising back up on one elbow again.<br />
&quot;What I felt for you the moment I first saw you was the stirrings of true love. Something I hadn&#39;t felt in... a mighty long time,&quot; admitted Virginia. &quot;I promised myself that first night after we parted company that I would take my time and at least be your friend. Always hopeful for more, but I was never going to push things between us unless you expressed a genuine interest in me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Virginia, my love,&quot; said Harold, staring at her. &quot;Becoming a weretiger may have been the catalyst that jump started things between us, but I was starting to feel something for you from our first meeting, despite my ongoing depression over missing Eliza,&quot; he added, referring to his deceased first wife. &quot;All of this may not have started out the way either of us wanted it to,&quot; continued Harold, while putting a paw on Virginia&#39;s shoulder, &quot;but it&#39;s real love, and I want to spend the rest of my life enjoying every moment of it with you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh Harold!&quot; cried Virginia, as she fell into his arms and the couple embraced each other again.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before they started kissing once more.<br />
Then the kisses grew longer, as one set of paws caressed a furry body while the other stroked a manly chest.<br />
The inevitable conclusion came as no surprise to either were, as the tigress joyfully mounted her mate, his hard barbed cock penetrating deeply into her love channel as Virginia McCoy lost herself in the thrill of riding Harold Jenkins once more until they shuddered as one, experiencing the mutual pleasure of climax together, before Virginia laid her head upon her future husband&#39;s furry chest and they fell back asleep, holding each other close again.<br />
