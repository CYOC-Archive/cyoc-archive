<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Between the sun and the after effects of Jacob&#39;s abrupt transformation, his, now her, vision took an extra couple of minutes to come fully into focus. Her brother was not a close likeness of who she had been just moments ago, but an exact double of who she had been. What had just happened, what crazy twist of fate now him, now a her and by estimation had him to be less than a year old? If this boy took his place as an older brother, why did Emily just leave with another boy? Emily was his girl, or she was his when he was still a he was just moments ago.<br />
Jacob hurried to bring Jamie back into the house before his parents came home from shopping. He had just got Jamie in her baby bed as he heard the family car pull up. It was good to have had mom and dad hire Emily to be Jamie&#39;s babysitter, but since his and Emily&#39;s break up last month it was just so darned hard to even see her, much less knowing that she was seeing that jerk Matt Conners.<br />
&quot;Emily, Jacob, where are you guys?&quot;<br />
&quot;Up here mom, I&#39;m just laying Jamie down for her nap.&quot;<br />
Upon seeing her teenage son coming down from her little princess&#39;s room she asked, &quot;where&#39;s Emily, did she have to leave&quot;?<br />
&quot;Yeah mom, you told her to leave at three o&#39;clock. She couldn&#39;t wait to see Matt.&quot; The teenager made no attempt in spitting out Matt Conners name with as much contempt as he could muster.<br />
&quot;Now sweety, girls will come and girls will go. I&#39;m sorry you and Emily are no longer dating, but honey I don&#39;t know what&#39;s come over you in the last month but you have been pretty immature.&quot;<br />
Jacob&#39;s little sister began crying at the perfect time, he was about to say something to his mom that would have resulted in being grounded for the rest of his life. So, he did the next best thing by giving his mom a glaring look, turned and stomped off in a huff.<br />
&quot;I hear mom, there has to be a way I can alert her that something tragic has happened. Maybe I can express in some way that that stupid piece of junk Emily conned me in hiding from her sister, somehow changed me, her original son Jacob into this baby named Jamie.&quot;<br />
Walking into Jamie&#39;s nursery eliminated the anger of dealing with a bratty teenage son. &quot;Why can&#39;t boys be as sweet as girls, especially when they are the age of Jamie?&quot; The reverie was cut short as Jamie began to cry.<br />
When Jamie saw her mom her intent was to maybe use some sort of charade strategy since it was painfully obvious that she no longer had the ability of speech that she had as Jacob just a half hour ago. As she was going to make the attempt, her stomach made a rolling sound and a warm mushy feeling began to spread between her bottom and what she embarrassingly knew must be a diaper. What was meant to be a howl in utter frustration in the absurd situation that she was now in, turned into being whimpering and crying as the little infant girl that the previous Jacob found herself as.<br />
Using her mom&#39;s sense of smell it didn&#39;t take long to determine why her little princess was suddenly being fussy. &quot;Aww what&#39;s wrong sweetheart, did mommy&#39;s little girl make poopy in her diaper?&quot; <br />
While listening to his mom&#39;s comforting humming, it began to dawn on Jacob that until he was able to articulate his thoughts into words his mom and for that matter everyone else will just see him as exactly what he appeared to be now, a very cute little infant girl.<br />
The days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and months turned into years. Jacob now began to adapt and to a degree identify as being little Jamie now, but the underlying goal was still present to try and get his parents know that she was the original Jacob. Along with trying to figure out a way to persuade his parents that he was not this cute little three year old girl he was, he often time wondered whatever became of Emily. Emily and He were the very same age when he was placed into this cursed existence. This new Jacob is now nineteen, so Emily must be as well.<br />
It was a typical evening of mommy bathing her little girl, followed by putting her nightgown on her, and then into her baby bed. As humiliating as it always was having his mom, now always being thought of as &quot;mommy&quot;, was a far cry less embarrassing than it was before she was potty trained. Jamie hadn&#39;t made a poopy accident in quite sometime, and since she has been wearing her pull ups, she had only pee pee&#39;d herself during the night once in almost a month . <br />
After turning on her little girl&#39;s night light, placing her in her baby bed, a night time story, followed by a kiss on her forehead, Jamie&#39;s mommy told her little princess goodnight.<br />
After looking at the luminescent stars and moon that adorned her ceiling, Jamie&#39;s breathing slowed, followed by the sleep that she cherished that gave her relief from the distorted life that she&#39;s had to endure for the last three years being trapped in this little girl&#39;s body. This night was going to be different, for unlike her typical dreams of being her former sixteen year old male self, she was still the accursed three year old toddler she presently was . Unlike her typical dream of being a teen aged male doing typical teen aged things, this dream was just her as a little girl in a plain featureless white room. A room that seem to be infinitely large, off in the distance there was a figure that she could tell was approaching her. A figure that resolved itself into what appeared to be a very small child, even being a baby in appearance, with wings protruding from it&#39;s back. The flying baby floated right up to her and began speaking. &quot;Hello Jamie, there is going to be more changes in the days to come for you dear. You have adapted very well so far in the life that was supposed to have been your in the first place.&quot;<br />
Incredulously Jamie responded to the strange little baby with wings. &quot;What are you talking about the life that was supposed to have been mine!? Look at me, I&#39;m a little toddler girl! Three years ago I was a sixteen year old boy, with a girlfriend I may add. I know you&#39;re a little baby, but we had even began making out !&quot;<br />
With a sheepish embarrassed grin the baby replied,&quot; Jamie I am much older than you may guess, actually it&quot;s been 8,878 of your years since I was created by the boss. The boss is the reason I&#39;m here talking to your subconsciousness right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re talking to me in my sleep? I notice that I am dreaming in my little girl body, why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Jamie, since I was the one that caused this mess I was ordered to tell you what happened in the first place .&quot;<br />
&quot; I know what happened, that stupid toroid magical thing changed me into a baby girl three years ago !&quot;<br />
&quot;Jamie magic only happens in the fairy tales your mommy reads to you at bed time, there&#39;s no such thing as magic dear.&quot;<br />
Angrily Jamie replies,&quot;Then how the heck did I go from a teenage boy to a baby girl !?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because honey, the order of the universe had to be corrected from my goof. I am with the Consciousness Placement Division of..., well you know where..&quot;<br />
&quot;A goof, what are you talking about a goof..? I had a very nice life as Jacob, that was not a goof !!&quot;<br />
&quot;Dear your parents were to have two children, a boy that was born nineteen of your years ago and a little girl that was born three of your years ago. Your consciousness, the consciousness that makes you Jamie, was placed into Jacob&#39;s body. You were accidentally placed into your brother&#39;s body, a goof that wasn&#39;t caught until three of your years ago.&quot;<br />
Now being very confused and exasperated Jamie replies to the little flying baby. &quot;What are you saying, that I was supposed to be Jamie in the first place!?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid so Jamie, we had just made you and Jacob&#39;s consciousness nineteen of your years ago, then there was a transcription error. The error that I made. When it was time for you to be physically born, that&#39;s when I caught the error. I took the problem to my supervisor..&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean you have supervisors..., you know.., there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yes, absolutely..! After your body aged six of your months, it was decided to take Jacob&#39;s consciousness from your six month old body and put it into his sixteen year old body. Of course we can&#39;t have two consciousness&#39;s in one body, so we took your consciousness and put it in the body it was supposed to have in the first place.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean to tell me that I never was supposed to have been a boy, but I was, I had a girlfriend named Emily !!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah yes Emily, she posed a significant problem.  We had to confer with another department to have Matt Connors come into her life.&quot;<br />
Indignantly Jamie said, &quot;You mean it was you guys that cause Emily and I to break up!?&quot;<br />
&quot;Jamie we had to, both of you were girls, not to mention she is sixteen years older than you. I&#39;m sorry it had to be done. Not to mention when we were prepping Jacob in his rightful teenage body, he didn&#39;t have anywhere close to the maturity to be in a boy/girl relationship. As we were creating the strategy of righting my goof we saw Matt Connors, and by our fate calculations, Matt and Emily would make a perfect match. Don&#39;t tell anyone I told you this, but as soon as Emily graduates her Child Development course, she and Matt will end up marrying.&quot;<br />
&quot;Noo, she can&#39;t marry Matt Connors...&quot;<br />
&quot;With a shocked look the flying baby responds. &quot;Well why not Jamie, they do live happily ever after after all !? Speaking of Emily, I know that you&#39;ve missed her, so we arranged it for her to move back into the home of her parents. Your mommy and daddy will discover this and eventually hire Emily as your babysitter.&quot;<br />
&quot;Babysitter, you&#39;re gong to have the girl I made out with, the girl I loved, as my babysitter !!??&quot;<br />
&quot;Well think it over Jamie, that won&#39;t happen for another two of your weeks. Uh oh, look at the time, I&#39;m going to have to shut this chatroom down. Your mommy is going to be waking you right about..., now.&quot;<br />
As much as Jamie&#39;s mommy hated it, the finances had gotten to the point that she was going to have to work as well as her husband. Granted it meant Jamie had to be placed in a day care, maybe she could find someone she could trust in watching Jamie at home. Wait, it seems Emily&#39;s mom was mentioning Emily moving back from college. Maybe it&#39;d be possible to see if she might want to make some extra money. Smiling Jamie&#39;s mommy looks down on her little girl, savoring her sweetness before awakening her. &quot;Princess, mommy&#39;s little girl needs to wake up so I can get your dressed for your first day at day care. I need to have you be a big girl and not cry when mommy goes to work.&quot;</p>
