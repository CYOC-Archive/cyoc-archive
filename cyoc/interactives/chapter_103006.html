<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So we should head home first and see if that needs any changing right now.&quot; Deena remarked holding out her wand as she spun it around a bit.  &quot;First things first though&quot;  small strands of energy crackled out hitting both her and Mickey in the head.  &quot;That should do it&quot; she said imitatng blowing on the wand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do what?&quot; Mickey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ensuring no matter how reality changes and shifts from whatever we need to change to fight the Nether Fiend or Those Who Infect Or Devour Or... NeFeinds cause that&#39;s a lot quicker to say, we still remember who we were.&quot;  Deena crossed her arms.  &quot;I accept who I am now, but if I&#39;m going to remain a 24/7 Magical Girl the rest of my life, that means whatever humanity I had was with my old life, for good or for ill.&quot;  She looked around.  &quot;And we should keep that in perspective since we are still fighting for the sake of this world and it&#39;s people.  If we forget who we were, then we&#39;d forget the core point of that mission and just transform everyone and everything to take down the NeFiends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm that actually is rather wise&quot; Mickey admitted, floating around her.  &quot;Some teams have normal human forms to ground them but that is not a luxury we can afford, so having something there makes sense&quot; he then smirked some.  &quot;Though honestly with ideals like that, I do wonder if you retain any actual personality and memories from your previous form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deena smirked.  &quot;Hey if I remember who I was I can also remember just how super hot I am now and get wet when girl spanking it to myself later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mickey chuckled some.  &quot;Yeah that answers that, though weren&#39;t you talking about magical boyfriends earlier?&quot;<br />
<br />
The magical girl shrugged.  &quot;Well duh.  If I&#39;m female physically that technically means I&#39;d be gay chasing after hotties.  Plus with this form who needs other babeage right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, yeah&quot; Mickey said wrapping a bit around her.  &quot;Though if we&#39;re keeping our memories, I&#39;m changing my name then to Milly then, to tribute the greatest performers ever made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Even before all this I kept telling you that was a fake band cat bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfft, don&#39;t matter how many NeFeinds we have to fight, &quot;You Know It&#39;s True&quot; will always be my battle theme girl bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that at least proves the spell worked on you&quot; Deena said petting the now Milly named familiar.  &quot;And with that done we can head out&quot; she then held out her wand, spinning it as a rainbow was shown forming an arc out of the school which Deena, with Milly still wrapped around dashed on at high speeds away....<br />
<br />
___________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
It was a couple of hours later nearing night as the sun for the most part had nearly dimmed in a neighborhood a few houses away from the school.  Specifically focusing on the second floor of a normal blue colored house.  More specifcially in a room where two young, about to be middle school girls were shown fiddling around with weird looking ear piece devices.  There were about six near the wall of the room and one in each of their hands, as one was shown screwing something into one of the sides.<br />
<br />
&quot;And.... there we go&quot; the girl screwing something in said, looking over the pair of what could now be seen mechnical looking ear muffs some.  &quot;That should be the last preparation to this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; said the second girl, still fidgeting with hers.  &quot;Once we get this one done, operation Fanta Park sneak should go off without a hitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first girl narrowed her eyes.  &quot;Fanta Park sneak? Seriously Cathy, I thought you&#39;d come up with a better name then that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl identified as Cathy turned to the other.  &quot;Admittedly I was thinking of something more punny, but sometimes the best names are the most direct Jane&quot; she then tweaked something on the sides of the ear.  &quot;Besides, us 8 are the only ones who are ever going to know about this anyway, so forgive me if the code name doesn&#39;t have more flourish&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Touche&quot; said the girl named Jane, leaning on the bed as Cathy was still working on top of it.  &quot;Now we just have to find a way to scrounge up enough bus fare to get there tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t Sabrina suppose to lend you the 3 dollars for that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jane shrugged.  &quot;Yeah but I guess she&#39;s annoyed at having to pay for the other fees for this little plan of ours and said &quot;why don&#39;t you do it yourself?&quot; so... that&#39;s where we stand on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cathy smirked.  &quot;Well fortuantley for you I planned on having to at least pay for maybe breakfast out before we went, so this afternoon I snuck some money out of my idiot&#39;s brother little stash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he still keeping his money in a broken plastic brown box?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah too cheap I guess to get anything else&quot; she said, continuing to screw in the ears.  &quot;And since he&#39;s likely going to spend the rest of this three day break with his even stupider friend just going around breaking random things all extended weekend, he shouldn&#39;t notice a 20 missing for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice&quot; Jane said, putting her hands over her head, leaning back.  &quot;Guess it does pay to have him sometimes, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me Cat, sometimes is a much rarer occurance then you might think&quot; she said, not realizing a few houses down Deena running down a rainbow bridge with Milly flying behind her.  &quot;While we&#39;re pulling off the scheme of a life time, that goof is probably doing who knows or cares what all day mom will probably scream at him for later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Man this magical girl thing pays off more then any crowbar would of&quot; Deena said, as she was shown sipping on a milk shake.  &quot;Seriously, why threaten someone for free food when just a cute pout and wink will get you the same thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to be more careful who you choose to appear in front of&quot; Milly warned, though there was a box of fries in his hands he was picking and chowing down on.  &quot;Now that we know realtering someone&#39;s memory and perspective of reality only works when they&#39;re actually close enough to you.  Thus we can&#39;t attract the attention of people outside our reach we don&#39;t want to have to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I chose a time when it was mad wicked abandoned&quot; Deena talked back.  &quot;Just that kind of cute guy&quot; she giggled some.  &quot;You know for a fast food employee anyway who was lucky he had that, or I would of saved him from minmal wage indentured servitude by having him be the first of our magic girl army.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, because that wouldn&#39;t of been a major hassle to track down to ensure the secret not leak to any lingering NeFiends&quot; Milly added sarcastically.  &quot;Seriously bro girl, you&#39;re not only magical girl mom but magical girl queen.  You have to pick your subjects clearly, since it won&#39;t work if they totally resist the urge to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deena narrowed her eyes, turning to Milly.  &quot;That&#39;s a rule now?&quot; she asked, rubbing her head.  &quot;I don&#39;t remember that.  How come you didn&#39;t say that before, and for that matter how come you have info I don&#39;t?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a familar I can connect further into the mind link of the Mystic Ten-Runes then you can&quot; Milly pointed out.  &quot;But even I can only sort through this knowledge so fast it gives, so if I don&#39;t explain to you everything right away, I probably don&#39;t know either until I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... guess that makes sense&quot; Deena walked closer to the yellow house in front of her.  &quot;So let&#39;s hope the rents then are either cool with the changes, or deep down cool enough to be forced to accept them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Considering how your parents usually have some sort of issue everytime you come home before, you probably will have to bank on the second one&quot; Milly pointed out following behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, especially arriving home fairly late&quot; she looked behind her.  &quot;With you in tow no doubt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t your folks say I could hang tonight with Cathy sleeping over her friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you. yeah, but current you-&quot;<br />
<br />
Milly&#39;s eyes flashed gold for a second before he gasped.  &quot;Current me says Duck!&quot; Deena quickly did so, narrowly avoiding a claw slash.  She quickly flipped back before taking her wand and shooting out a bolt of rainbow energy, shown hitting a figure which was revealed to be a black and blue tendril monstrosity that screeched out in pain before evaporating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, a NeFiend!&#39; Deena said, a bit shocked.  &quot;Didn&#39;t think we&#39;d run into one so quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The message did say once you accepted the powers, the battle would begin.  You&#39;d think the NeFiends were going to wait around for you to build an army before attacking however they could?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess not&quot; Deena then heard a bevy of cries as she looked around, several more demonic monstrosties around her, lunging  at the magical girl who narrowly avoid being hit as two slammed into another.  &quot;Man how many of these pests came out?&quot; She asked, her wand glowing as she smacked the two with it directly, causing them to evaporate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fortuatnely only seven more&quot; Milly said, his eyes still glowing as one lunged at him, Deena jumping in front of the beast and grabbing it by a tendril, twirling it to hit another NeFiend as she blasted the two with her wand.  &quot;And these are all the most low level troops too, so as you&#39;ve proven one blast should take them out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deena nodded, four flying at her from all directions as one jumped up to lounge at her from the top, screaming an ear piercing howl.  &quot;Still you&#39;d think someone would of lit a light or something hearing these beasts&quot; she said, doing an upward kick to knock the one to her left up, before grabbing the one to her left and flip tossing it into the one who was kicked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember NeFiends are invisible and unnoticable to average humans, all the more reason you were tasked with fighting them&quot; Milly pointed out, Deena twirling and creating a small enough tornado around her to smack the two NeFiends charging from the north and south into one another.  Charging her wand, Deena upped the power of the tornado, getting the four in it&#39;s vortex  and knocking them upward into the fifth as shen shot a charged rainbow shot, evaporting the five in an instant.  &quot;Good news is like I said before, you won&#39;t have to deal with anything very nasty until you have time to gather more forces.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh I&#39;d say those things were still pretty nasty Mil-Bro&quot; Deena said, striking a mix of a heroic yet graceful pose.  &quot;I&#39;m just a lot nastier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, because I didn&#39;t tell you the bad news&quot; Milly&#39;s eyes were glowing brighter.  &quot;There&#39;s a low level general who I&#39;m guessing sent these as an appetizer, whose now coming for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh have any info on who that would be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milly processed various images through her head before nodding, revealing said low level general was</p>
