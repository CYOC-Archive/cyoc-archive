<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janet watched as Tracey grew shorter.  Then she noticed that the school uniform changed into a elementry school uniform with a sticker with grade 5 on the shirt.<br />
<br />
'Why is she making herself younger, wasn't she young enough?', thought Janet.<br />
<br />
Janet watched as the numbers on the sticker counted backwards as Tracey grew ever younger.  Tracey's brunet hair got shorter and lighter in color.  She got gaps in her teeth as the permanent teeth disappeared and baby teeth returned.  Janet noticed a smirk on her face as Tracey was looking at her.  The changes stopped when the sticker had a letter K printed on it.  Tracey's hair was pulled back with a hair band with bangs going down to her eye brows.  What got Janet's attention was that her eye level was the same as Tracey's.  With a panic, Janet looked down and saw that she too was now five years old and wearing a uniform like Tracey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why twacey, we wittle wive wear owds&quot;, said Janet with a shock on how babyish her voice sounded.  She covered her mouth with her hand.<br />
<br />
Tracey giggled and then said, &quot;Because we ave chance to be kids and pway bewore we be big giwls 'gain&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What bout Sawah and cwystal, me want my baby!&quot;, cried Janet with tears in her eye's as she looked down at her belly that stuck out some with baby fat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be cry baby, we bing bac Sawah and cwystal when we get big 'gain&quot;, said Tracey as she came over and put her hand on Janet's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;, sniffed Janet as she wiped her eye's with her arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh, wet's go pway in you room&quot;, smiled Tracey.<br />
<br />
&quot;What 'bout Fwed and Tom?&quot;, asked Janet looking at Tracey.<br />
<br />
&quot;They no twouble, they babies&quot;, giggled Tracey pointing at the sofa where Fred was sleeping earlier.<br />
<br />
There on the sofa was the most aborable little baby boy Janet ever saw.  He was sucking his thumb and wearing only a diaper.  Janet guessed he was about 1 years old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fwed cute baby&quot;, giggled Janet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep Tom cute baby too.  Me make them sweep wong time so we can pway&quot;, said Tracey.<br />
<br />
Janet and Tracey ran up the stairs to her room where they discovered that it changed into a little girl's room with lots of dolls and stuffed animals around it.  They let themself's forget all about adult things as they played with all the dolls and got into being little girls again.  After about an hour, Tracey got another idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wet's pway dwess up&quot;, said Tracey as she got up from the floor.<br />
<br />
Janet followed Tracey to the master bedroom, which is now Janet's parents room.  Tracey went to the dresser and opened it up.  She began to pull everthing out onto the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy will be mad at me, maybe spank&quot;, said Janet with some fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mommy not here, member we weally big giwls&quot;, said Tracey as she began to take off her school uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops me fowgot&quot;, giggled Janet as she too began to take off her uniform.<br />
<br />
When they got down to just thier panties, they noticed that they were thicker then what they were wearing earlier.  Janet's was pink with Winne the Poo on the front and Tracey's was white with Minne Mouse on it.  They paused to giggle at the sight of them and then continued to pick out what to put on from the women's clothes on the floor.  Janet pick out a white blouse that went down to her feet and pool a bit.  The neck went over one shoulder and look like it could fall off any moment.  Tracey picked out a pink night gown and tried to hold it up.  The shoulder straps kept falling down her arms.  Janet noticed a white object with cups and straps on the floor, and went to pick it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What this, me fowgot&quot;, asked Janet looking a Tracey, who always knew the answer to everthing.<br />
<br />
&quot;hmmm, me fowgot name, but me know mommy puts it on her boobies&quot;, answered Tracey.<br />
<br />
Losing interest in the white object Janet walked over to the mirror to get a look at herself.  She saw a blonde haired 5 year old wearing her mommy's shirt.  Her hair was pulled into pig tails.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me pwetty, me hope me pwetty as mommy when me big&quot;, said Janet admiring herself in the mirror slowly forgeting what she looked like when she was an adult.  Tracey came over and they both giggled and talked about how they would look like when they get big.  After a few minutes, Janet felt a tingle in her groin, signaling that she need to pee.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh oh, me need to potty&quot;, said Janet as she struggled to remove her mommy's shirt.<br />
<br />
Tracey giggled as Janet fell over onto her butt when she tried to pull the big shirt over her head.  She then watched as Janet raced to the master bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Twacey help, potty too big!&quot;, yelled Janet from the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Tracey ran into the bathroom and saw that Janet was naked and tring to climb up onto the potty.  She went over and gave Janet some help.  Tracey held onto Janet's feet so that she would not fall into the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better wipe, mommy says never fowget to wipe&quot;, said Tracey when she heard the peeing stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;k&quot;, said Janet as she grabbed some paper by the potty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wet's have bath, since we in bathwoom&quot;, said Tracey looking at the big tub next to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds wike fun&quot;, said Janet as she climbed back down.<br />
<br />
Janet began to fill the tub as Tracey took off all her clothes.  When the water was warm enough and high enough, they both climbed in.  They had fun slashing each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;When me grow up me want to be mommy and have stork bring me a baby giwl named Sawah&quot;, said Janet daydreaming forgeting wear babies come from.  Her child mind is slowly taking over since there is nothing to remind her that she is really older.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too, but me name my baby cwystal, me like cwystal.&quot;, said Tracey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Twacey how old we weally, me know me weally big giwl, but how big?&quot;, asked Janet as she sat in the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;hmmm me think 10&quot;, thought Tracey.<br />
<br />
&quot;10?, that weally old&quot;, said Janet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, we might not be able to pway when we 10&quot;, said Tracey with a frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me not want that, me wike to pway&quot;, said Janet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wet's pway wit computer 'gain&quot;, said Tracey as she climbed out of the tub and pulled up her panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, but do we be bigger or wittler&quot;, asked Janet also climbing out the the tub.</p>
