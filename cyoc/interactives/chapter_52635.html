<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I rode my little brother's huge cock, panting, god this was amazing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck bro, fuck...&quot; David was holding me in his arms whilst his fat cock thrust into me. &quot;So... tight... ungh...&quot;<br />
<br />
And then we both came! His huge balls churned a massive load into me. So much it dribbled out and down his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;David... that was... fuck you're...&quot; I slid off him panting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love you too.&quot; He smiled and kissed my forehead. I loved this new confidence, such a turn on. I watched him wipe down his deflating cock. I lay on the bed, my new pussy warm and spent, my finger idly exploring it.<br />
<br />
He got dressed, his huge cock make an obscene bulge in his underwear, his muscles showing through his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Catch you later bro.&quot; He called on the way out. &quot;Round two later!&quot; Laughing he disappeared.<br />
<br />
I lay on the bed now, naked, my pussy pleasantly sore and warm.<br />
<br />
I slept a little, the energy I'd used with David had tired me out. I awoke a little later to the sound of laughter. Getting dressed (putting on some clean panties my drawer was now filled with) I headed out the back. Next door I could hear the neighbour's kid playing in the garden. The warm weather meant that Josh was running around the garden shirtless and in shorts. I always thought he was really annoying. Loud, obnoxious, bit of a bully and only 7. I smiled to myself feeling the light in my pocket.<br />
<br />
Pulling it out I peered over the low fence and called him over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh! Come here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh ran over panting, he'd been playing catch with their dog. His parents obviously out again. They left him alone a lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's up?&quot; He stretched his arms out.<br />
<br />
I flicked the light to full blue. &quot;Nothing much, just bored.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna play catch with me? Or you too faggy for that?&quot; I frowned at this.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks, was gonna play on the wii some.&quot; I knew they didn't have one and Josh would want to join me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I play?&quot; His eyes lit up so I nodded and he ran around.<br />
<br />
I set up the machine in the living room. He was still shirtless and was stood in front of the TV with the remote.<br />
<br />
&quot;You playing?&quot; He asked noticing me sitting down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let you have a practice first, don't want you saying I cheated when I beat you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, okay, but you ain't gonna beat me.&quot;<br />
<br />
His attention now on the game I turned my attention to the light.<br />
<br />
I turned it on and shone it at his feet. They grew immediately. I held it there curious. His feet were bigger than mine now. 4 foot 5 and size 15 feet. Looked ridiculous but he didn't notice. I raised the light to his calf muscles and watched them lengthen and swell. Hair sprouted from them, thick black hairs.<br />
<br />
I turned the light off. &quot;YOu got some muscles on your legs Josh. They're bigger than mine!&quot; Josh laughed without looking round, too engrossed in the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I run a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but they're so hairy.&quot;<br />
<br />
He blushed a little. &quot;Mom says it's puberty and the rest will catch up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same with your feet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; I flicked the light on again. This time shining it on his upper legs. HIs quads immediately flared and got hairy. The muscle definition was something to behold. Slabs of muscles on legs now longer than mine. He looked hot and weird. Next his butt, it swelled in his shorts, his shorts growing with them. Two globes of muscle now flexed in his shorts everytime he moved. I felt wet down there again. Shame he was facing the wrong way.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you got there?&quot; He asked staring at my hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; I panicked. Just a torch.<br />
<br />
&quot;It don't work though? I can't see a light coming from it? And why are you shining it on my legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just messing Josh, sorry.&quot; I smiled to myself, he can't see the light, only the person using it can! This could work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I shine it on you more?&quot; I looked at him patiently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, you're weird Pete.&quot; He returned to the game.<br />
<br />
I stood up and then started to flash the light about him. His lower back straightened and lengthened, his abs, popped into existence, now like small rocks. HIs chest expanded with each breath, large pecs forming, he was now taller than me! He was about 6'5! His neck became thick and powerful, his arms bulged with muscle, even his hands looked bigger, way bigger than mine. His chest had curls of hair on it. Even his face looked older, still young but more masculine!<br />
<br />
Now for the last bit. I lowered the torch, feeling his eyes on me and the game and held it over his crotch. I held it there a good 20 seconds or so. Then flciked it off and sat back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You done?&quot; This boom of a voice asked looking down at me, glowering a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm.. yeah?&quot; I looked up at him, I was so horny.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just wanted to look at my body didn't you?&quot; He smiled, folding his arms over his immense chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did Josh, I'm sorry. You're just so big, way bigger than me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and? I'm bigger than everyone.&quot; He laughed, cocky bastard, I love that!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah but you're still only 7 you can't be bigger... everywhere.&quot; I nodded down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am dude. Look&quot; He pulled down his shorts and a cock of dreams fell out. It was bigger soft than I was hard and I'm a little over 8 inches! Wait... I was. I remembered my new pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on then?&quot; He said looking down, a nasty glint in his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You saw mine, now I see yours.&quot; He continued his staring.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't... I don't have one...&quot; I looked a little ashamed back at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... don't? What you got then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A... a pussy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh's smile just widened and something started to respond....</p>
