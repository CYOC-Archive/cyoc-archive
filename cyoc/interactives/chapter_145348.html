<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Now normally I would respect the round robin format and let someone else post next, but what I had planned for &quot;Curiosity&quot; was too big for just one post, hence: part 2.—tmw.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>Karen&#39;s right. I seriously doubt this is a first edition but the copyright–or at least, listed year of publication–is still before Moe&#39;s parents were born.</i><br />
Wanting to read it in full detail, Nichole Charleston sat down in a chair within Tara Strange&#39;s living room with The Moon Lake Were Guide Book.<br />
Or at least, that&#39;s what she was calling it, since nowhere was there any hint of an official title except GUIDE in small print on what she assumed was the title page. There wasn&#39;t even any indication on the red cover or spine as to the book&#39;s title or contents.<br />
Secretly, Nichole did what she thought was her parental duty and glanced through the volume once before when she found it in Karen&#39;s bedroom.<br />
But she became too distracted looking at the pictures of various female and MALE weres to fully realize anything other than how beautiful and handsome (<i>All right. Sexy.</i>) such creatures could be.<br />
Given her past prejudice about the town and how Moon Lake law was forcing one of them to give up their humanity to join so they would have a vested interest in protecting the town and its were community, Nichole didn&#39;t really have too many positive thoughts about weres even after Karen volunteered to be the &quot;family were&quot;, provided she could be something feline based.<br />
But now...<br />
<br />
Karen Charleston sat in a chair by the bedroom window and stared out into the forest surround Tara Strange&#39;s cabin.<br />
<i>I can see why she chooses to live out here. It&#39;s so peaceful and quiet. Somewhere nice and serene to go to after a hard day&#39;s work.</i><br />
Yet last night was a different story, hearing all the various were couples out and about in the surrounding woods going about their... business.<br />
<i>Oliver did look nice,</i> Karen recalled, thinking about the werecougar she met*. <i>His fur coat, that handsome smile, those abs. That—</i><br />
Karen felt herself blushing as she recalled seeing the hint of what was between his legs. <i>And it wasn&#39;t even fully erect yet!</i><br />
She knew that, considering how fertile weres are, that she needed a species specific birth control pill before joining were society, let alone enjoying life among the furry set, but still...<br />
<br />
<i>Bears, foxes, wolves, mermaids, cats, lions, tigers, other sea life. Just about everything&#39;s here that one can imagine there being a were version of that animal,</i> realized Nichole, going through the guide book more thoroughly this time.<br />
Even if she wasn&#39;t a parent, there were some things in the beginning that did have her concerned. The emphasis on females being responsible for taking their birth control pills because otherwise there was a risk of the were population overwhelming humanity due to how fertile weres were. <i>Why isn&#39;t there any male birth control?</i> she wondered.<br />
But that wasn&#39;t more than a couple of paragraphs, compared to the whole chapter devoted to protecting were society. The persecution of weres throughout history. The intentional misleading of normals (as regular human beings were referred to) through various means to attempt downplaying and discrediting were existence to just fictional myths. All the precautions weres took and the rules they obeyed in regards to when and where they could display who they truly were...<br />
<i>What&#39;s Karen getting into?</i><br />
Yet, even with all the negatives that becoming something else entailed, were society had many perks too.<br />
<i>They can live for up to 400 years?</i> Nichole read in disbelief. <i>While not invulnerable, weres have no problems with &#39;common&#39; ailments like colds, and the ladies never have to worry about sore back muscles from carrying such large breasts.</i><br />
Then, after having completed the introductory material, Nichole started reading about each individual species.<br />
Like their natural counterparts, werefoxes mated for life, with many other species enjoying long and happy monogamous marriages too.<br />
The strength and speed of many races. The aquatic weres natural underwater abilities.<br />
But there was one thing that all weres seemed to have in common that they enjoyed beyond belief.<br />
<br />
<i>Everyone out there sounded like they were really enjoying themselves last night,</i> thought Karen, recalling all the noises. <i>I won&#39;t be surprised if they&#39;re at it again tonight. Too bad I can&#39;t join them. Yet.</i><br />
Stray thoughts of Oliver, let alone other male weres started filling her mind as Karen continued to stare out the window.<br />
<i>I stop and think a lot about how I&#39;ll look furry, with my tail and claws and all the other feline were features. It seems to be on a daily basis now. I&#39;ve even stopped and wondered if Peter would like me feline, because regardless of how I might feel about him, I have no intention of going through the rest of my life as a canine anything. But even if things did work out between me and him, I&#39;ve never stopped and thought about myself among the rest of were society, let alone my specific group,</i> realized Karen.<br />
<i>The guide book mentioned that various groups meet from time to time to discuss important matters, and I&#39;ve got a feeling there&#39;s more going on at those meetings than just that. Seeing Oliver and all the other weres I&#39;ve met. Hearing them...</i><br />
Karen leaned her head against the window, still staring out into the woods, blissfully unaware of what her hands were doing...<br />
<i>Do I dare go outside again tonight? As much as I want to be a were, I certainly don&#39;t want to be a mother before high school graduation, let alone college. Yet to feel the grass beneath my paws. The wind gently wafting against my fur. My tail swishing in delight as a handsome male shows me how virile he is...</i><br />
It was all Karen could do not to scream out in pure pleasure as the self induced orgasm ripped through her body.<br />
It was only after she calmed down that she realized one hand had been fondling her breasts while the other was within her panties.<br />
<br />
<i>They are beautiful,</i> Nichole conceded, reading each entry and studying every picture, for the guide book included a male and female image for each species.<br />
<i>Yet it seems that the favorite past time of were society is sex. Besides stressing protection and not creating unwanted children, this manual goes on and on about every male&#39;s prowess. Each female&#39;s libido. The sheer animal magnetism (for lack of a better term) between a couple. How open and frank they are on the subject. How free they are in expressing their pleasure, even with other weres at times!</i><br />
Page after page, Nichole Charleston kept reading.<br />
There wasn&#39;t any one specific were pair she favored over another, just an overall interest in the subject at hand.<br />
<br />
Other than having a general idea of where his wife and daughter physically were within Tara Strange&#39;s cabin, Moe Charleston was busy with his own project.<br />
He was sitting up, but spread out across their hostess&#39; living room couch.<br />
Not daring to go online (just in case the Gambonis were monitoring any pizzeria supplier related websites) he sat with a pen and legal pad, mentally working out and writing in long hand everything that needed to be done to finish converting the old sandwich shop he recently acquired into the latest version of Moe&#39;s Pizza.<br />
<i>Considering where we are and the local crowd, maybe I should plan some were specific pizzas. An extra meat one for the carnivore types. Maybe a more vegetarian one for the weres that don&#39;t eat meat. I wonder if the water weres would like—</i><br />
His thoughts were interrupted when he caught movement out of the corner of his eye.<br />
&quot;Yes honey? What is it?&quot; Moe asked, looking up at his wife.<br />
Nichole Charleston stared at her husband. Her top was completely unbuttoned, revealing the straps of the bra she wore.<br />
She smiled and licked her lips before bending down to kiss him.<br />
But Moe realized it wasn&#39;t just an ordinary kiss, as he felt her tongue gain entry into his mouth.<br />
When their lips finally parted, Nichole moved her head to whisper in his ear, &quot;Take me. NOW!&quot; as her right hand cupped what she knew awaited her between his legs and the left dropped the Moon Lake guide book down onto the floor next to the couch. <i>Take me like my mate should when I&#39;m in heat!</i><br />
