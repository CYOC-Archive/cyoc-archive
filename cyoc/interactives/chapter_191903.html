<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Max is playing around with herself, Rick finishes their next round of changes. He does not say a word and just looks over towards Max as he set her change to happen before his own. He is pretty interested in seeing how she reacts to it, and for how long it takes her to notice it happening.<br />
<br />
Max, who has closed her eyes to enjoy the pleasurful feelings even more, misses Rick finishing the edits completely. However she even doesn&#39;t realize something is happening to her, even when her horns suck back into her skull, her snout returns to a more human looking face, and her tail retracting back inside her body. Her ears grow more pointed, and become covered in bright green scales that match her eyes. Her hands return to their normal 4 fingers and a thumb shape, however her nails grow out and become sharp points. And it is only when she falls off of the couch from having her udder disappear, throwing her completely off balance, does she open her eyes and see that her changes have already started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Tell me when you ssssstart it!&quot; She hisses towards Rick, while also having a heavy lisp to her &#39;s&#39; her words.<br />
<br />
Max then begins to cough a bit, as all of her teeth retract into her gums until just her 2 upper canines are left. These 2 teeth actually lengthen considerably, hollow out, and even become foldable to the extent that she can fully close her mouth without them showing at all. Max, having stopped coughing now that her mouth and throat have finished becoming extremely stretchable, looks up at Rick. Her now slitted pupils glaring at him.<br />
<br />
However before she could even do anything, she falls over flat on her face as her legs give out completely. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oww! Sssss&#39;at hurt!&quot; She says as she carefully rubs her forehead, doing her best not to accidentally poke herself with her now sharp nails. &quot;Ow! &#39;Ut sss&#39;a fuck!&quot; She cries as her tongue suddenly feels like the tip of it has just ripped in half for a split second. She sticks it out and is surprised to see it not only now has a forked tip, but is only about half as thick and wide, but almost 4 or 5 times longer then her human one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I ssssome kind of ssssnake?&quot; Max asks, now piecing the little details together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something like that.&quot; Is all Rick says. He won&#39;t tell her the full extent of his edits, because he took another small liberty with them again. However this time he thought it all through, and made sure not to accidentally mess things up again with a foolish oversight.<br />
<br />
Max feels her legs fuse together and grow out into a very long snake tail. Finally, most of her backside, her full tail, some of her hips, and the under-outersides of her breasts become covered in green scales as well, matching her ears and eyes. Her breasts however, are left completely untouched. They even are still pinkish with cow teats, and are slowly filling with milk. &quot;Rick, you forgot to change my titsssss! Ssss&#39;ey sssstill are udderssss!&quot;<br />
<br />
The newly transformed snake woman slithers over to Rick and looks at him dead in the eyes with a frustrated expression on her face. She then quickly leans in and quickly kisses him with a playful smile before he can even hope to react to her &quot;attack&quot;. Next, she coils up around the bullman and impales her new cloaca onto his cock, shoving it in as deep as she can, which unlike her former cow self, isn&#39;t nearly as far due to the difference in her physical structure. And it is super tight too, as her opening is not nearly as wide as it use to be while his bull cock is still as girthy as ever.<br />
<br />
Max shoves her tongue deep into Rick&#39;s mouth, coiling it around his tongue as she forces him to make out with her. Meanwhile, Rick&#39;s changes are now beginning, starting with his dick splitting down the center and reshaping to have a hemipenis structure which now helps him spread Max&#39;s cloaca wide open and his full lengths to finally be able to fit inside of her.<br />
<br />
Rick&#39;s legs merge into his own tail and he gains similar snake parts to Max. Then his hair lengths and his face softens. His remaining skin smoothes out and becomes clean and flawless. His face and body take on a more feminine appearance and a pair of D cup breasts push out from his chest. Unlike Max, his are just normal breasts, but that doesn&#39;t mean they are any less unexpected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Why am I alsssso a ssssnake woman?&quot; I sssstill have a cock and everysss&#39;ing&quot; hisses a surprised Rick. Max is equally as shocked, but isn&#39;t against Rick&#39;s new girly appearance as she can still feel him fucking her as strong as ever. Him also having a woman&#39;s appearance is just a bonus for her this time. Rick is Rick, and as long as he has a cock that fits her perfectly, Max didn&#39;t care too much about the rest.<br />
<br />
It is while they are coiling up into a large lust filled knotted pile of snake tail and Max&#39;s milk that Rick realizes why he has a woman&#39;s appearance. He had set their new race to the snakewoman preset, then went in and manually made some changes. He had forgot that sometimes, snakewomen are considered to be members of an entirely female species. But since he manually edited his cock, he was able to preserve that area through the preset settings, just like how he did with Max&#39;s two upper udders.<br />
<br />
He laughs and explains it to Max, who also gets a chuckle out of it, now that she wasn&#39;t the one on the receiving end this time around. Rick is also glad that he remembered to make sure they stayed warm blooded too, though coiling up together with Max in front of the fireplace wasn&#39;t sounding like such a bad idea at the moment either. Though while Max seems to enjoy being female, it isn&#39;t cutting it for Rick, and he already plans on fixing that when the cooldown ends in a few hours.</p>
<hr/><h3>
What do the two of them do while the cooldown is still in effect?</h3>
