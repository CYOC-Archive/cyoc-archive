<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was on a drizzly Tuesday night when Brenda was stumbling home from the bar. She’d just lost her job at the office due to downsizing and was having trouble finding anywhere to go for more work. It was a depressing week that she thought would end with her drowning her sorrows in cheap whiskey and then flopping into bed to sob all of her feelings out. That was until she saw the strange building that wasn’t there before.<br />
<br />
It was a strange, medieval style castle that appeared to have been crossbred with a nightclub. Technicolor lights flashed through the lower windows of the main building flanked on either side by two towering spires topped with parapets and flags. It seemed out of place here in the city, perhaps largely because it was a purposeful design choice, much like the light of an anglerfish that dwelled deep within the ocean floor. Brenda was drawn to the strange building like a fly to honey, the pounding dance music coming from within worming its way into her brain.<br />
<br />
Outside the front doors she saw what looked like a muscular, bare-chested executioner. His face was hidden under a black hood that showed only his eyes, glowing red with some kind of unknowable forbidden power. Brenda guessed that those eyes must have been LEDs or something.<br />
<br />
“Halt,” the executioner commanded her in a deep, booming voice. It almost seemed like he had a voice changer under his hood or something. Nonetheless, Brenda halted. She stared at this man, his ash colored skin reflecting the light of the street lamps and coated in oil to accentuate the definition in his pectorals and abdominal muscles. His arms were as thick as truck tires to her booze blasted mind, and she could see the creases in his muscles as though they were drawn with sharp lines.<br />
<br />
“What business have you here at the Pleasure Palace?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Pleasure… wha?” Brenda tilted her head in confusion.<br />
<br />
“Are you unfamiliar with our establishment?” the executioner noticed, “This Pleasure Palace is just one of many opening their gates across this world. We are dedicated to delivering the finest of carnal pleasures and fulfilling the wildest of earthly desires. Men and women will come far and wide to experience our services! Whether you desire the finest liquors and bar food or a night of otherworldly love making, we are able to provide.”<br />
<br />
It was then Brenda glanced at a poster tacked onto the glass front doors that read “Now Hiring” in bold red lettering. She blinked at it, looked back up at the executioner, and pointed at the poster.<br />
<br />
“Whadda ya hiring for?” she slurred out.<br />
<br />
The strange, hooded tower of a man looked Brenda up and down, considering her for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Are you perhaps looking to work here then?” he pondered aloud, “Hmm… from what I can see, you just might have the makings of one of our Palace Maidens.”<br />
<br />
“A maiden?” Brenda pointed at herself with starry, drunken eyes, “Me?”<br />
<br />
“Intoxicated though you might be now, I think you’d make for a fine maiden,” he explained, “You certainly don’t have the build for a bouncer such as myself, at any rate. Once we get you sobered up, you’d make a perfect addition to our collection… that is to say, our team of servers and entertainers and so on. Understand that if you join, your very life is going to change drastically, not just now but several times more while you work for us.”<br />
<br />
“I can deal,” Brenda reasoned, “what’s it pay or whatever?”<br />
<br />
“It pays in untold riches,” the bouncer nods, “not just monetary. You seem to have the willingness we seek in a maiden. We can have you start as soon as tonight, if you’d allow me to summon an escort for you.”<br />
<br />
“That’s… awful nice of you,” Brenda smiled, “takin’ on little old me on short notice.”<br />
<br />
“Think nothing of it,” the gigantic man shook his head, bringing his pointer and middle fingers to his ear. He seemed to be speaking into a hidden earpiece under his hood. “We have a new prospect. Send for someone to escort our new maiden to the Locker.”<br />
<br />
A few moments later, the front doors swung open, and out strode a woman in very unusual garb. She was wearing a waist length black latex dress that hugged her body like a second skin. Her arms were bound behind her back with a bondage harness, and her high-heeled legs were bound together at the knees. A strange latex blindfold was wrapped around her eyes and ears like a sort of sensory deprivation mask, and her hair was styled into a pair of deep purple buns. Her lips, which were painted deep purple as well, were wrapped around a large ball gag that appeared to have a small speaker embedded in the middle.<br />
<br />
“<i>Fuck,</i>” Brenda realized through her alcoholic haze, “<i>it’s that kind of club.</i>”<br />
<br />
“Like, hi-yee!” a ditzy, airheaded voice greeted through the ball gag speaker, “Are you the new maiden?”<br />
<br />
“This woman is indeed a new maiden,” the bouncer explained before Brenda could open her mouth, “She inquired about the poster out front and I believe she’ll fit right in with the others.”<br />
<br />
“Like, super-dee duper!” the ball gag cheered. The woman herself stood stock still and made only the barest indication she was aware of her surroundings. She turned to Brenda and gestured with her head at the entrance. “C’mon inside, babe! Hee hee~! Let’s get you hooked up into the system!”<br />
<br />
Brenda was about to turn and leave, but part of her was worried that this would be the only opportunity left for her for work. With a gulp, she followed the strange woman into the palace, the doors closing behind her. The woman led her through a room with a strip club setup, with scantily clad men and women alike pole dancing for the entertainment of the paying sleazy customers. She noticed that the dancers had some strange and unusual features about them. One of them had a second pair of boobs, another had green skin, and yet another had an elephant trunk for a tail.<br />
<br />
“This way please,” the woman called, ushering Brenda through an Employees Only door. What she saw on the other side was nothing like the woman had ever seen before in her entire existence. This room was like an enormous warehouse, packed with hundreds and hundreds of naked men and women. Each person was suspended inside a large square frame, arms and legs bound to the corners. These frames were stacked five units tall in large walls, like the rows of a wine cellar. Rows and rows of walls stretched out into the distant side of the room. The bound people were also wearing the sensory deprivation masks her guide was wearing, but instead of balls in their gags they had hoses stuffed inside their mouths. She could hear the low hum of vibrators coming from the strange devices that were affixed to their pelvises.<br />
<br />
“Like, welcome to your new home!” the escort giggled, “You’ll have all of your needs catered to while you’re here in the locker, such as water and nutrient goo, and can’t forget the educational materials getting streamed into your head through your sensory deprivation mask! While on standby you’ll also receive 24/7 sexual stimulation to make sure you’re ready for our paying customers at a moment’s notice!” A mechanical arm appeared on an overhead maintenance rail through one of the walls, reaching for one of the framed people. It selected a brunette woman and unhooked her from her bounds.<br />
<br />
“Looks like someone just picked #11037 for a good time!” the escort exclaimed, “She’s being taken to get her skin scrubbed and her hair washed before her body gets mutated to the customer’s specifications. Anything from a fatter butt to cat ears to extra arms and more is possible! Whatever crazy little desire they might have. Speaking of washing, we gotta get <i>you</i> undressed and cleaned up before we tattoo your barcode onto your neck.”<br />
<br />
Before Brenda could get a word in, two more arms appeared and hoisted her into the air. They carried her away to a sterile white room where they roughly removed all of her clothes and whisked them away to who knows where. Jets of soapy water blasted her from all sides, exfoliating her skin through sheer water pressure alone. She was then blow dried, and her blonde hair was combed while a deprivation mask of her own was wrapped around her eyes and ears. All outside stimulation was cutoff and all she could hear was her own breathing.<br />
<br />
She could feel the arms carrying her back into the main warehouse and affixing her into a frame of her own, feeding tube and all. She was restrained so tightly that she could muster only the tiniest of movements as vibrators were plugged into her anus and vagina. They turned on and locked her into a state of constant stimulation, causing her to moan around her tube. Once she was completely set up, a screen suddenly turned on in front of her eyes, and music was being streamed into her ears.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the Pleasure Palace,” a soothing voice floated through the hypnotic synthwave, “You have just been hired as a maiden. In other words, you will serve as a sexual escort for anyone who should select you. Your identity before now is being withheld from you by us until such time that you should choose to resign, which is going to be a very unlikely decision for you to make. Your last name has been changed to your product number, and a barcode has been tattooed into the back of your neck. Welcome to the team, Brenda #47520!” After that, the screen and music started pumping her brain with subliminal training that would prepare her for any desire her would be clients would have.<br />
<br />
Brenda belongs to the Palace now.</p>
