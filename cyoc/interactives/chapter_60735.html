<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back within the locker room, Isaiah goes into a panic as his clothes (except his shoes) are missing. He and Lester wrap their towels around their waist, search around the area, but come up empty handed. Since they weren’t in the restroom long, they both come to the conclusion that they were inevitably stolen. Lester realizes that Monty is to blame as he would be the only one childish enough to steal someone’s clothes. Now without anything to wear, Isaiah angrily sits down on top the bench and crosses his arms. “Dammit man…” he sighs. “It wasn’t like I was in their long…”<br />
<br />
“I know,” replies Lester. “Ah guess that dumbass figgers it’s funny snatchin’ up people’s stuff.” He then steps over the bench and begins to put his clothes back on. “Don’tju worry, ah ain’t gonna let him treat you like that.” <br />
<br />
“You’re going to get my clothes back?”<br />
<br />
“Yep. That bastard’s goin’ ta git what’s comin’ to him. Trust me.”<br />
<br />
“(sigh) I hope so.” Isaiah pauses for a second and stares at Lester as he dresses. “Um, thanks for decidin’ to help me out here.”<br />
<br />
“Psh, ain’t nothin’ to decide. Ah’m jus’ helpin’ mah buddy is all.”<br />
<br />
“Why're you so quick to call someone you just met your friend?”<br />
<br />
“Why not? Yer a nice fella. Wouldja rather ah jus’ stay here and watch yer naked hind?”<br />
<br />
Isaiah smiles. “Heh, I wouldn’t mind…! (Gasp*) Ah, um… Dammit, I really didn’t mean…!”<br />
<br />
“Hahah! Relax man! Yer jus’ speakin’ yer mind!” Lester finishes up by sliding on his shoes and then stands. Next, he quickly puts one foot up on top bench and begins tying it. “I’ll tell ya everahthin’ ‘bouts whas happenin’ to ya once ah git back; then, we’ll REALLY git down to tha griddy stuff heheh!”<br />
<br />
“Eeerrgh man! No!”<br />
<br />
Lester laughs. “Yer kinda cute when yer seerous (serious) like that. Relax, ah ain’t forgit ‘bout our promise. Heck, jus’ promise ME ya won’t try ta go leave this joint.”<br />
<br />
“Sure. It isn’t like I have any clothes to leave with…”<br />
<br />
“Good point.” He finishes up by tying his other shoe and slips on his brown leather jacket. “Well, ah’ll be back.” He then leaves the locker room and heads out to find Monty.<br />
<br />
With nothing else better to do, Isaiah lies on the bench and watches the ceiling lights. He begins reminiscing about all the events that happened up until now, and soon wonders how his friends would react when they find out the chew had turned him into a homosexual. Thoughts of his pals soon change to hunger as he stomach begins to growl. It then occurs to him that he hadn’t eaten anything at all since Lunch during school. <br />
<br />
All of a sudden, footsteps are heard entering the locker room and Isaiah rises. He glances across the aisle and finds it’s that one guy he became so infatuated with. The man is soaking wet and has a green football towel covering around his waist. Isaiah looks down and becomes highly irritated by the growing bulge he sees on his towel. “Dammit…” he mumbles lowly as he blushes. He hastily turns around and tries to rid the sight. <br />
<br />
The drenched guy opens his locker, pulls out his duffle bag, and begins shuffling through it. He then pulls out a bottle of liquid soap and slams his locker shut. Before he leaves, he happens to come across that black kid from before squirming at the side of his eye. “ ‘Ey dude. You straight?” he asks as he approaches the teen. <br />
<br />
Isaiah thinks, “Crap!” and then turns his head to see the guy standing behind him. “Oh uh um… Yeah, I’m fine! Eheh…” In his head, he then tells himself, “Damn Isaiah! Whatever you do, DON’T turn around!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, okay. Ya kinda weirded me out when ya jumped and ran away like that,” replies the guy. “Where Lester run off to?”<br />
<br />
“He went to get my clothes back.”<br />
<br />
“Get your clothes back?” replies the guy as if he didn’t already know. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, that friend of yours Monty stole my stuff!”<br />
<br />
“Really? Tcheheh, that sucks dude. Sorry to hear that. You new here bro?”<br />
<br />
Isaiah nods. “Uh-huh. W-wait... No. I’m just a guest!”<br />
<br />
“Oh. Then wanna hit the showers with me while you wait?”<br />
<br />
Isaiah’s heart skips a beat and his eyes widen. What he’s asking can’t be true, can it? “A-A... A shower…!?” he stutters as he slowly turns his head. “Wit’ you…!?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah dude, it’s such a drag when there’s no one to chill with and talk to. I mean, it’s straight if you don’t want to an’ all. I’m just askin’.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah could no longer combat these inner emotions he’s feeling and finally decides enough is enough. He calms down a bit, exhales a deep breath, and turns around. “Dude, of course!” he replies with a big smile on his face.<br />
<br />
The guy became surprised by Isaiah’s sudden burst of glee and gives him an odd look.<br />
<br />
Isaiah sees this and adjusts himself quickly. “I-I-I mean I might as well right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” replies the guy in a drawn out manner. “What’s your name anyways?”<br />
<br />
“Isaiah. And you’reee…-?”<br />
<br />
The man’s eyes jump back and forth between Isaiah’s face and the rather big bulge between his legs sticking out. “It’s Rico… Um, what’s with the boner bro…?”<br />
<br />
Isaiah knew he would ask about it. “Oh, I… um… well…” <br />
<br />
“Lemme guess, ya have a thing for Lester do ya?” smirks Rico.<br />
<br />
“Lester?” Isaiah shakes his head “Psh, uh uh. No.” <br />
<br />
“Hahah… Of course you don’t~…” replies Rico in a curious tone as he figures’ Isaiah is in denial. He then turns around and begins walking to the shower. “I don’t mean to rush ya but let’s go. I got work at 9:00 (P.M).”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Isaiah is completely smitten by Rico and his toned jock-like body; so much so, that Isaiah licks his mouth and gives the bump on his towel it a little grind. Once again, Isaiah calms down and takes a deep breath. He has to get control of these emotions before they get control of him. “C’mon Isaiah, stay yourself. Be Calm &amp; go with the flow,” he mumbles to himself. He repeats this over and over in his head as he grabs his rag and proceeds to follow Rico. With each step, his control increases as his boner steadily subsides. Life as a complete homosexual will be… interesting indeed.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Lester exits the gym and also leaves the back compound. He proceeds to make route to the back entrance of the bar, but happens to find several shadowy figures lurking between some semi-trucks. Upon closer inspection, one of the figures resembles Danny. Lester figures if it really is Danny, then he’s most likely with Mikey. He grew quite curious and decides to sneak up on whoever was there.<br />
<br />
As Lester tiptoes his way across the lot, C.J., Mark, Danny, and Mike sneak their way between the semi-trucks as they try to approach the back compound. They stop behind a large trash dumpster to survey the entrance.<br />
 <br />
“You sure Isaiah is back their Mister?” asks C.J.<br />
<br />
“Uh, maybe. Ah guess it doesn’t hurt ta check.” replies Mike. “And quit it wit’ the mister stuff. It don’t sound right.”<br />
<br />
“I still think this is stupid guys…,” reminds an annoyed Mark. “Why are we sneaking around like this anyway…?”<br />
<br />
“Well, you kids aren’t really supposed ta leave the front bar. I’d be real messy if someone finds you 2.”<br />
<br />
C.J. scoots in between Danny and Mike. “Anyway, do you 2 know who those guys were with Maxwell a little while ago?”<br />
<br />
Mike shakes his head. “Beats me kid. One of thems Monty, but I ain’t ever seen the other 3 faces round here before.<br />
<br />
C.J. remembers their earlier encounter with Monty and is amazed by how different he looks without that leather and chain get up. He didn’t recognize him at all. “How about you Danny?,” asks C.J. “You seen those other guys before?” <br />
<br />
Danny shakes his head no, and then Mark taps Mike on the shoulder. “Hey, why doesn’t he say anything?” <br />
<br />
“The poor guy’s vocal chords gon’ messed up real bad when he transformed.” Mike rubs Danny back. “At most he’ll grunt at times, but that’s all he can do now.”<br />
<br />
“Oh wow… That’s awful,” consoles C.J.<br />
<br />
Danny makes a toothy grin at C.J. and grunts.<br />
<br />
“Heheh, Danny don’t mind. Me and the fellas take real good care of ‘im. Anyways, I think we…!-“<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Lester jumps out from behind and screams really loudly making everyone jump in shock. “Gyahahah!” he laughs as he crosses his arms. “The… tha look on yall’s faces! Hahahah!”<br />
<br />
Mike exhales a deep breath and fixes his glasses. “Dag gonnit kid! You’re gonna make a fella have a heart attack! What ya you doin’ here anyway?”<br />
<br />
Lester settles down and straightens up. “Hmhm, Ah’m jus’ passin’ ‘round lookin’ fer that knucklehead cousin o’ mine. What’er YA’LL doin’ here? Aint these guys sposed (supposed) ta be in the bar?”<br />
<br />
“Oh uh, we’re jus’… on our way to mah truck ta get somethin’!”<br />
<br />
“All 4 o’ ya’ll?” Lester shakes his head and crosses his arms. “Alright, what you lot up to?”<br />
With nothing else to do or say, C.J. stands and confronts Lester. “We’re looking for our friend Isaiah! Where is he? I know you know--...”<br />
<br />
Lester puts his hands up in defense. “Woah relax lil’ fella yer friend’s fine. He’s err… bein’ treated at the moment an’---.”<br />
<br />
“Treated!?,” screams C.J. “If you’ve done anything to him, we’re getting the police!”<br />
<br />
“Quit yer yellin’ dammit! Ah jus’ said yer friend’s fine!!”<br />
<br />
Mark steps forward, “Then where is he?”<br />
<br />
Uh-oh, Lester’s in a bind. His dad said Isaiah and his friend’s are to be separated. If only he could get them to wait a little longer until he gets back. “Why don’tju fellas go &amp;…-”<br />
<br />
“Yer friend’s at mah house gettin’ sum rest!,” replies a familiar loud voice from afar. They all turn to find Maxwell with one of those Arctos guys approaching.<br />
<br />
“Pa!? When’dju git back!?” yells Lester as he runs closer.<br />
<br />
“Not too long ago soldier!”<br />
<br />
“Aw Damn, it’s pappy,” mumbles Mike. “He musta known we were out here all along.”<br />
<br />
Maxwell turns to C.J. and Mark. “Mah apologies ‘bout the wait their boys. Had ta take care of sum grown-up stuff.”<br />
<br />
“Why all the secrecy?”, asks Mark “What happened to Isaiah?,”<br />
<br />
“Yer friend gon’ an tasted sum ov’ are special Mack Brand Tobaccah. Ya prob’bly won’t believe it, but he’s changin’ into a gay man.”<br />
<br />
Mark instantly became speechless. What these bears told him before was actually true!? “Jesus Man… No way. T-this can’t be real…,” mumbles Mark. He grips his stomach as the truth is too much. <br />
<br />
Mike lays his hand on Marks shoulder and mumbles, “Told ya kid.”<br />
<br />
Lester, Maxwell, and the Arctos guy quickly glare at Mikey in dismay. “Told ya!?” yells Maxwell. “Ya tellin’ me ya gon’ blabbed ‘bout our secret to these boys!?!”<br />
<br />
Maxwell steps up and swings Mike in the face causing him to fall to the ground with a bloody nose. “DAMMIT, YOU KNUCKLEHEAD!! What else you done told them!?”<br />
<br />
Lester and C.J. try to block Maxwell’s path, but the large man easily brushes them aside. He kicks Mike hard in the stomach before pulling out a small pistol and aims it at him. “C’mon pa!” pleads Lester. “Ya don’t need to do all that!”<br />
<br />
“HUSH UP BOY!! Ah ain’t gonna risk everahthang jus’ cus some four-eyed idjit’ don’t know how ta keep his mouth shut!”<br />
<br />
Danny dives in and covers Mike with his body. He grips Mike tightly and securely making sure he’ll be the one to take the bullet.<br />
<br />
“Tch. You can go to Danny if ya want,” remarks Maxwell as he slowly pulls the trigger. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck!? You crazy man!?” yells Mark.<br />
<br />
Just then, the stern-looking Arctos man rushes forward and grips Maxwell arm. “Stop.” he says calmly. “Calm down. We’ll handle this.”<br />
<br />
Maxwell’s arm shakes a little before he finally withdraws the gun from Mike’s direction. “Damnit!” he cursed while kicking some dirt onto Mike and Danny. He then angrily stomps off in another direction to recollect himself. <br />
<br />
Lester assists Danny and Mike, while the stern Arctos man turn his sight towards C.J. and Mark. “Allow me to introduce myself,” says the man in a very austere tone. He opens up his suit and hands his calling card to the teens. “I’m Allen T. Pryce; head of Arctos’s Department of Internal Security in this region.” He bows. “On behalf of Arctos, I hear do apologize on account of your friend.”<br />
<br />
Mark glimpses at the elaborately designed bear claw on the card. “Who and what is Arctos?”<br />
<br />
“Arctos is a global company who manufacture and sells various products for the Bear Community. We help sponsor and drive the bear society throughout the world within the shadows.”<br />
<br />
“Going around and turning innocent people into gay rednecks is also part of your agenda to right…?” seethes C.J.<br />
<br />
Pryce stands tall and puts his hands behind his back. “It is as our client say, your friend is now a homosexual.”<br />
<br />
No matter how many times they hear it, C.J. and Mark still can’t believe something like this is happening.<br />
<br />
“However, as far as an actual transforming is concerned, we’re still unsure of what he may become.”<br />
<br />
“What?” mumbles C.J.<br />
<br />
“Judging from our clients data, your friend is at a standstill. There’s a possibility he’ll have no apparent physical changes if at all.”<br />
<br />
Hearing that relieves Mark a little; C.J. however, is quite leery of that statement. He was unsure what to think; especially when the change [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE] underwent depicts quite the opposite.<br />
<br />
“You hear that man?,” asks an eased Mark. “Even though Isaiah’s gay now, he won’t change into that redneck you said he’ll become!”<br />
<br />
C.J. ignores Mark. “You say he won’t change, but where’s your basis? How do we know you aren’t lying?”<br />
<br />
Pryce leers at C.J.<br />
<br />
“But he just said he wasn’t going to transform!” replies Mark. <br />
<br />
“He SAID there’s a “possibility” he won’t. Besides, how can we believe what he's saying when we haven’t even seen Isaiah yet!”<br />
<br />
“We can take you to your friend, if you would like,” suggests Pryce.<br />
<br />
“Please.”<br />
<br />
Pryce turns to Maxwell. “Graham, if you would.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah yeah…,” replies Maxwell as he pockets his pistol. “C’mon boys; Follow close.” <br />
<br />
Before walking off C.J. looks back at Danny and Mike. “Go on kid. I’ll be fine,” says a bloody Mike as he holds his nose. “I ain’t gonna take back what I said. I’ll see to it that it gets done. Go! Yer friend’s waitin’ for ya.”<br />
<br />
C.J. bows and says, “Thank you,” and then quickly paces after Maxwell and Mark. <br />
 <br />
As the three of them head off towards Maxwell’s home, Pryce draws out a peculiar pair of grayish-blue leather gloves and slides them on. He then turns around and aim towards Mike and Danny. <br />
<br />
“Hey guy, Thanks for the help. Me an’ my boy here woulda end up with holes in our heads if it wasn’t for ya,” says Mike. Danny nods and agrees.<br />
<br />
“Hows your condition?” asks Pryce.<br />
<br />
“I’m fine, my nose just a lil’ busted is all.”<br />
<br />
“Good.” Pryce closes his eyes and cups his hands together. All of a sudden, his gloves start emitting a mysterious yet mesmerizing blue aura. Its captivating icy ambience enthralls Danny and Mike. Lester cringes at the familiar sight and rises up and away from the two. <br />
<br />
“Holy--! That’s an awesome trick ya got there! How’dya do that!?” comments Mike.<br />
<br />
Pryce open his stern eyes and quickly slaps Mike and Danny in the forehead with his palms. The blue aura from his gloves vanishes and Mike and Danny fall to the ground out cold. Pryce stands, removes the gloves, and holds his own forehead as if he’s suffering from a migraine. “Ung…,” he groans.<br />
<br />
“Ya ahright?” asks Lester.<br />
<br />
“Yes…,” he mumbles before shaking his head. “Thank you for your concern. I’m alright.” He slides the gloves back in his pocket. “I’ve erased their memory of all transpired events tonight and rid their minds of those 3 teenagers. The guy on my right here will wake up as if he ran onto a wall and broke his nose. The guy on my left will wake up a couple of minutes after and will remember when his partner hit the wall. Will I need to arrange a ride for them?”<br />
<br />
“Geez, he’s thorough…,” mumbles Lester. “Naw, they’re truck drivin’ partners. Their semi is jus’ over their actually,” He points. “Ah’m sure a cuppa fellas in the bar will pick’em up sooner or later.”<br />
<br />
“Good. In the meantime, you will continue to contend with the subject correct?”<br />
<br />
“Hey don’t talk like he’s yer guinea pig or sumthin’! He’s mah buddy now ahright!?”<br />
<br />
Pryce closes his eyes and turns his head away. “Of course. My apologies.” He then puts his hands behind his back and begins walking towards Maxwell’s home.<br />
<br />
“Ah reckon that fella you suits picked up finished transformin’ huh? I can’t believe you 4 are really goin’ through wit’ this…,” utters Lester.<br />
<br />
“To keep this organization secret and to prevent further damage, we will do any means necessary. For your father’s sake, it would be wise if you continue to follow orders.” Pryce continues his walk back to Maxwell's home.<br />
	<br />
Lester kicks a can on the ground in anger. “..Damn cocky ass bastard! Yer’ tha reason why mah pop’s like he is today…” With that, Lester enters the back of the bar and continues his search for his knucklehead cousin, Monty and Isaiah’s clothes. <br />
<br />

<br />
Somewhere on the country road, Cletus had stopped for gas and uses a pay phone to call [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]. Apparently, you didn’t pick up and the home answering machine starts up. Cletus leaves you a message saying that he’ll be home late, hangs up the phone, &amp; walks back to his (your) truck.<br />
<br />
“Thanks fer fillin’ mah truck up, Phil. Ah do so ‘ppreciate it,” says Cletus as he hands him the gas money. <br />
<br />
“Anytime Cleeboy, anytime,” says the old man as he places the pump back on the old fuel dispenser. “Ah reckon ya off to The Triple Crown again eh?”<br />
<br />
“Yep…”<br />
<br />
“She---it… I tell ya, that place ain’t nutin but a load a horseshit. Why ya keep’ goin’?<br />
<br />
“Well, ah reckon dis prolly mah last time really. Someone verr’ preshus (precious) in mah life came back.”<br />
<br />
Phil nudges Cletus’s shoulder. “Haha, dat a boy Cletus. Ah herr ya! Ah’ll still be seein’ ya out dese parts right?”<br />
<br />
Cletus enter his truck. “Ah don’t know; Maybe. It’s been a real pleasure doin’ business wit’ ya though.”<br />
<br />
“Well, ah ain’t gun’ hold ya an’ longer. Y’know yer always welcome at this station! Go on n’ git sum’ pussy tanight big guy!”<br />
<br />
“Ahah…, yeah! Bye Phil,” Cletus then drives off and back on the road. “He prolly thinks mah preshus ah’m talkin’ ‘bouts a lady,” he says to himself. As he drives, he begins thinking about you back at home. “After this, ah’ll be home soon Cliff.”<br />

At home you can be found snoring loudly atop the couch with the T.V. and fan on. Your massive stomach shrank a little as it’s now much more muscular under all that fat; your droopy chest developed and became large pectoral behemoths; Your fingers had fattened to be more adept with your large burly paws; finally, your feet and legs are big enough now to support your hefty weight. You snort in your sleep and scratch your hairy chest. You are no longer [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]; your name is Clifford and you’ve always been Cletus’s older brother.</p>
