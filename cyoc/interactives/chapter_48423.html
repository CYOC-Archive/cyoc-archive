<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pho put his hands behind his head and stretched.  His school <br />
desk squeaked and moaned as he shifted his bulk.  His desk <br />
was way too small for him.  So was his tight white T-shirt.  As <br />
Pho stretched, his shirt made little groaning noises as its fibers <br />
were pushed out of shape, straining to the max to contain his <br />
arms, back, and shoulders.  Even though Pho's cheap T-shirt <br />
was pretty big, it wasn't made for someone shaped like Pho.  <br />
Pho was big and strong.  Ever since he was 12, he had been <br />
pumping up his muscles with weights.  And now those muscles <br />
were totally huge.  At only 18 years of age, Pho had 270 pounds <br />
of ripped, throbbing muscle packed onto his 6-foot 2-inch <br />
frame.  He was already way bigger and stronger than any other <br />
man around, and as long as Dr. Aschenbach kept giving him the <br />
injections, he was just gonna keep getting bigger and stronger.  <br />
Pho liked being big and strong.  It hadn't always been this way.  <br />
Only 6 years ago, he had been a scrawny Asian immigrant who <br />
the other kids in the town wouldn't hang out with.  A lot of the <br />
boys picked on him for being poor and not knowing English.  <br />
Pho's English was still just OK, but that didn't matter anymore, <br />
since his muscles were so big he could do whatever he felt like.  <br />
Now Pho was getting even with all the snotty white boys.  They <br />
used to make fun of him, hit him and make him feel bad.  Now <br />
they were all nice to him, because they were all so scared, <br />
especially the jocks.  But sometimes he would still beat one of <br />
them up anyway, because he felt like it.  He ruled his high school <br />
and scared the whole town.  And things were just gonna keep <br />
getting better.<br />
<br />
Pho was always bored in school.  He was especially bored in <br />
Ms. Nyswaner's Health class, which was last period.  All he <br />
wanted to do was eat and then pump his muscles some more.  <br />
He already knew about the body's muscles and hormones and <br />
stuff, and there weren't many girls in the high school he hadn't <br />
fucked at some point, so he knew everything about Health.  But <br />
the Doctor made him.  So he sat in class and was bored.  To <br />
make the time go by Pho shifted in his seat, stretching his <br />
bulging muscles, and thought about what he was gonna do after <br />
school, like pumping some huge weights or fucking up some <br />
guy.  Sometimes his big brown dick would stiffen in his sweat <br />
pants, pumping up with hot blood.  His 12-inch hardon would make a big <br />
tent in his sweat pants, which were already pulled tight around <br />
his huge quads and granite butt.  Pho didn't care.  His hormones <br />
made him get a lot of hardons.  But some of the girls saw, and <br />
they stared at the big bulge, and whispered to each other.  <br />
<br />
One day in Health class Ms. Nyswaner was teaching about the <br />
muscular system, and how the muscles get their nourishment.  <br />
We were going to have a test where we had to name the muscle <br />
groups of the body.   She was going to go over the groups we <br />
had to memorize by pointing at a pull-down chart that had all the <br />
muscles of the body on it.  But the chart was broken and wouldn't <br />
roll down.  One of the nerdy boys came up to try to get the chart to <br />
roll down.  The class began to murmur among themselves, <br />
pleased at this distraction from the lesson.  Suddenly, a <br />
clownish boy towards the back of the class spoke up, yelling to <br />
Mrs. Nyswaner and the class in general, &quot;Make Pho come up <br />
and be the muscle chart!&quot;  The class was electrified.  Some of <br />
the girls giggled, and the jocks Pho hadn't beaten up lately <br />
chimed in, saying, &quot;Yeah, dude, your muscles are massive!  <br />
Make the nerd point `em all out!&quot;  The others just sort of laughed <br />
nervously.  <br />
<br />
Ms. Nyswaner was caught off guard by the clown's remark.  She <br />
started in her chair, and blushed.  In her weak moments she <br />
secretly admired some of the husky young males in her English <br />
classes.  But Pho was in a class by himself.  From the front of <br />
the class, she stole glances at him when the students were <br />
busy at their work.  Her eyes fixed on the teen bodybuilder <br />
whenever papers were being passed back through the class.  <br />
Pho would raise his arm to pass a piece of paper to the girl <br />
behind him, his biceps mounding up against his melon-sized <br />
left delt as the hamlike arm crushed the straining sleeve of his <br />
T-shirt into his armpit.  He was the only student whose clothes <br />
she remembered.  Always the tight white T-shirts.  And the sweat <br />
pants he somehow got away with wearing.  Sweat pants were <br />
supposed to make one's lower body shapeless.  Why could <br />
Pho's not hide anything?  Between class periods, her eyes <br />
followed Pho's simian backside as he strutted down the <br />
hallways, the globes of his proud musclebutt alternately tensing, <br />
like big bowling balls shifting against each other.  And the <br />
obscene fullness between those grotesquely swollen thighs.... <br />
Ms. Nyswaner hated Pho.  Her poor nice husband never <br />
understood why she was so demanding in bed lately.  Now Ms. <br />
Nyswaner was upset with herself for blushing.  &quot;Pho, please stay <br />
in your seat; stay in your seat, Pho,&quot; she protested weakly.  But <br />
she had lost control of this class -- Pho was already moving.<br />
<br />
Pho levered his way out of the too-small seat and walked down <br />
the aisle, taking off his shirt as he walked towards the front of the <br />
classroom.  Pho had to take off the straining T-shirt by grasping <br />
the neckband along the sides of his neck and gently tugging up.  <br />
This was the only way Pho could now take off a shirt without <br />
ripping it.  Unless someone else peeled it off for him.  Or unless <br />
he got frustrated and just tore it off.  When Pho reached the front <br />
of the class, he had the T-shirt completely off.  The class saw <br />
Pho's lats ripple as he tossed his muscle-stretched T-shirt onto <br />
Ms. Nyswaner's desk.  The mingled smells of cheap deodorant, <br />
sweat and teen boy rose from the warm cotton to the teacher's <br />
nostrils.  Ms. Nyswaner shuddered, and kept crossing and <br />
uncrossing her legs under her desk.  Pho saw the teacher <br />
shudder, and his full lips parted into a wolfish smile, showing <br />
perfect white teeth.  Pho turned around and stood relaxed in front <br />
of the class.  He put his hands on his slender hips and pushed <br />
down the waistband of his sweats, to show his tiny waist.  The <br />
abs of the Asian muscleteen popped out like rows of little soda <br />
cans stacked sideways.  And those ab muscles were always <br />
tight from having to support Pho's bulging torso.<br />
<br />
Pho's face and neck still looked like a normal teenager's.  His <br />
neck was graceful and a little boyish-looking.  It hadn't had time <br />
to catch up with the rest of his body.  It was as though you had <br />
taken a normal teenager and morphed his body from the neck <br />
down.  His young face and neck made him look like he was <br />
armor-plated with muscles.  Around his neck Pho wore a thin <br />
gold chain, which draped along the contours of his traps and <br />
pecs.  The lowest links of the chain always got stuck in the deep <br />
cleavage between Pho's pecs.  So Pho picked the chain out from <br />
his cleavage, and made it drape down his back instead.   Pho's <br />
arms were at his sides, pushed out by his massive lats.  Pho <br />
grinned and hit a double biceps pose.  His arms looked like they <br />
had basketballs in them.  Pho mezmerized the class with <br />
several more poses.  A couple of the girls moaned out loud as <br />
the Asian teen flexed his huge muscles for the class.  A few of <br />
the boys couldn't help it as their dicks got hard. They hoped the <br />
hardons would stay hidden in their baggy jeans.<br />
<br />
Soon the bell rang.  Ms. Nyswaner ran to the nearest girls' <br />
restroom to regain her composure.  A small group of girls, and <br />
again a couple of the boys, gathered around Pho as he put his <br />
shirt back on, putting their hands on Pho, feeling his muscles, <br />
and asking him how he got so big.  Even the girls whose <br />
boyfriends were present went up and felt Pho's muscles.  The <br />
boyfriends just slunk out of the classroom, or pretended this <br />
didn't bother them.<br />
<br />
The boys never dared to protest or make comments that Pho <br />
could hear, especially the jocks.  Two of the boys in Ms. <br />
Nyswaner's class still had bruises on their bodies from where <br />
Pho's big fists had landed.  They hid the bruises under their <br />
clothes, and hobbled around the halls.  Pho was smart now.  He <br />
made sure that when he beat up local boys, he didn't make a <br />
mark on boys' faces or hands.  He had learned about that the <br />
hard way, after Andy Proffitt had come home with a lot of the <br />
bones in his face broken.  Andy was one of the snotty kids who <br />
used to make fun of Pho when he first came to America.  His dad <br />
owned the second-biggest bank in western Kansas, so he <br />
thought he could do whatever he wanted.  One day, when Pho <br />
was 15 and already pretty pumped, Pho caught up with Andy <br />
after school.  After Andy came home looking like that, Andy's <br />
parents went to the principal and the police and said they had to <br />
kick Pho out of the school and put him in jail.  But it turned out <br />
they couldn't, because then the Doctor got this letter saying Pho <br />
had a Post Dramatic Stress Disorder, or something like that, <br />
from when he was a kid in Laos and the Communists came and <br />
killed his parents.  When actually Pho just mostly liked to beat <br />
guys up.  So they had to let Pho back into school, especially after <br />
the Doctor also said he'd call the ACLU and get the Government <br />
involved, since the authorities were obviously bigoted, or so the <br />
Doctor said.  But at this time the Doctor also told Pho he couldn't <br />
defend Pho anymore unless Pho would stay in school and pay <br />
attention.  So Pho got more careful.  But he still had his ways.<br />
<br />
The story is still going around the senior class about how Pho <br />
beat the shit out of a guy who was on the high school tennis <br />
team.  This happened just a few weeks ago.  Pho was driving <br />
his old truck home from the town's little private gym, the one <br />
where Pho had his massive workouts, and where he also <br />
worked, since the Doctor had gotten him a job there too, working <br />
behind the business counter where people came in.  Pho <br />
thought that someday he might be the owner of the gym, if the <br />
Doctor got him a loan and if he stayed out of trouble.  His way <br />
home took him through the warehouse district that runs along <br />
the railroad tracks, through the center of town.  This is where they <br />
used to store the grain and turn it into flour. This was before <br />
ArgoCon came 30 years ago and put up the steel silos on the <br />
edge of town, where they put the grain now after harvest, before it <br />
gets shipped off to Chicago.  Today most of the warehouses are <br />
abandoned.  Not many people go there anymore, except the kids <br />
who park their cars along the bare streets and alleys, and party <br />
and make out in the buildings at night. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, Pho was driving past the warehouses on his way home.  <br />
He was totally pumped after one of his massive back workouts.  <br />
His swollen lats were stretching the seams of his cheap T-shirt <br />
even more than usual.  The place was mostly deserted.  Then on <br />
one of the side streets he saw a parked car.  He knew who the <br />
owner was.  It was Corey Meyer, one of Andy Proffitt's friends.  <br />
Corey was one of the rich kids too, and thought he was hot shit <br />
because his dad had bought him a new SUV for his last birthday.  <br />
Seeing the car attracted Pho's interest, and he whipped his truck <br />
onto the side street where it was parked.  Then Pho saw <br />
something that made him really mad.<br />
<br />
As he drove up the side street where Corey's car was parked, he <br />
saw Corey having an argument with Jeanine Pospisil,a girl Pho <br />
recognized from high school.  Actually she was in Ms. <br />
Nyswaner's Health class, where Pho had shown off his muscles <br />
one day.  It looked Corey had taken her out here on a date.  Now <br />
Corey was trying to get her to go inside one of the warehouses, <br />
but Jeanine obviously didn't want to and was resisting.  Corey <br />
got angry when she resisted, and grabbed her wrist with his <br />
hand to lead her into a warehouse.  Jeanine tried to pull away <br />
from Corey, and that's when Corey drew back his free hand.  He <br />
was just gonna slap her for being a whiney bitch.  His family <br />
owned lots of stuff in town.  The townspeople were sort of like <br />
servants.  Why couldn't Jeanine just give him what he wanted?  <br />
Corey had other stuff to do too.  But he started and turned when <br />
he heard a car draw near.  Because Corey was a coward, too.  <br />
He didn't want anyone to witness his bad behavior.  He turned <br />
his head to look towards the sound and realized that he had the <br />
worst witness of all.  <br />
<br />
Pho's face got dark as he saw Corey.  His nostrils flared and his <br />
upper lip curled.  Spoiled-rotten rich kids like Corey disgusted <br />
him, and made him think of all the times they used to treat Pho <br />
bad, before he grew his big muscles.  He ground his old pickup <br />
truck to a stop in front of the warehouse and got out.  The truck's <br />
springs squeaked as Pho got out.  He walked up to the two, <br />
fuming.  Pho's powerful heart was pumping adrenaline into his <br />
bulging muscles, getting them ready to smash.  He was gonna <br />
splatter Corey across the ground, but then he remembered what <br />
the Doctor said.  He wanted to own the gym someday, so he <br />
couldn't actually kill Corey, even though he sure would've <br />
otherwise.  Corey turned pale as Pho's wide body suddenly <br />
blocked out the setting sun.  His grip on Jeanine's wrist went <br />
loose, and she pulled away.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hi Pho,&quot; stammered Corey, &quot;Actually, we were just --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OOF!&quot; went Corey, as Pho's open left palm slammed into <br />
Corey's thin chest, knocking him to the dirt.  Since Pho had <br />
knocked every bit of air out of Corey's lungs, he lay gasping as <br />
the young bodybuilder stood over him, snorting with rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you can hit a woman?  I show you who hurt who,&quot; spat <br />
Pho, and he bent down and picked up the gasping boy by the <br />
front of his nice shirt and by the crotch of his pants.  Pho's white <br />
T shirt couldn't take the strain anymore, and it ripped at the <br />
armpits as the pumped-up teen lifted Corey over his head like he <br />
was nothing.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now I beat up for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pho carried the tennis-playing punk toward the side door of an <br />
old disused seed-corn warehouse.  Pho kicked the door with a <br />
big booted foot, easily snapping the rusty deadbolt that held it <br />
locked.  He dropped the struggling boy down from over his head <br />
and into his arms as he went through the door.  Inside, evening <br />
light came through the gritty west windows and reflected off <br />
particles of grain dust floating in the air.  The wooden rafters <br />
were supported by walls of splintery wood and by two square <br />
wooden pillars down the main axis.  Pho flung the boy onto the <br />
battered floor and put a boot on his chest to keep him down.  He <br />
turned to Jeanine and told her to stay out.  &quot;You keep the door <br />
shut,&quot; he said.  &quot;We come out after we have a talk.&quot;  Jeanine was <br />
so confused.  This had all happened so fast.  She hated Corey, <br />
and didn't want to go out with him anyway.  But she shut the <br />
door.  She looked through the space where the bolt used to be, <br />
to see what Pho would do to Corey.<br />
<br />
Pho took his boot off of Corey's chest, and the boy stumbled to <br />
his feet.  He was coughing and wheezing from the rough <br />
handling Pho gave him.  Standing between Corey and the door, <br />
Pho took off his shirt and pumped his pecs.  The round slabs of <br />
muscle flicked up towards his chin as he bounced them.  Corey <br />
was going to cry.  He knew this was revenge, whatever Pho was <br />
going to do.  Through the door-hole, Jeanine saw the bulging, <br />
oval muscles of Pho's lats ripple, like a shifting pile of eggs, as <br />
he tossed the torn shirt aside.  Corey cast his eyes back and <br />
forth, like a trapped animal, and suddenly made a run for it.  He <br />
darted behind the wooden pillars, towards the back of the <br />
warehouse.  But Pho was faster.  He easily caught up with Corey <br />
and grabbed him by the back of his expensive shirt, ripping it off.  <br />
Pho grabbed Corey's little arms and used his big chest to shove <br />
the boy against the sharp wall. Corey was pinned to the wall by <br />
Pho's muscles.  Pho grabbed Corey's right arm, the one he <br />
used for his girly tennis games, and wrapped his big, calloused <br />
palm around Corey's soft biceps.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be pretty big man, if you fight a woman,&quot; Pho snarled.  <br />
&quot;Let me feel you muscle.&quot;  Pho's bowling-pin forearm bulged as <br />
he kneaded Corey's little arm with his thick fingers, squishing <br />
the little muscles around and tearing them.  Corey howled and <br />
sobbed as Pho's big hand kneaded his soft little biceps.<br />
<br />
Pho released Corey's bruised arm and backed up half a pace.  <br />
He started to pump his muscles again, flicking his pecs and <br />
flexing his biceps right and left.  The muscles obeyed, swelling <br />
with hot blood, getting ready for their next workout.  Pho snorted <br />
into Corey's face like a bull.  Now Corey was getting frantic.  His <br />
porcelain-doll face was blotchy and his fine features were <br />
contorted with pain and shame.  This wasn't how it was <br />
supposed to work.  Corey and his family were on top of the town.  <br />
Through his tears he shrieked desperate curses at the Laotian <br />
muscleteen.  &quot;You can't get away with this, you fucking gook <br />
freak!&quot; he howled.  &quot;I'll have my dad destroy you!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;This for you father,&quot; said Pho, as he took up a boxing stance <br />
before blasting his iron fists into Corey, covering the boy's soft <br />
torso with punches.  The muscles of the young bodybuilder <br />
bunched and flexed as he pummeled the kid's torso, blasting <br />
his fists into Corey's slender chest and soft stomach, pulverizing <br />
his soft little abs and bruising his organs and ribs.  Corey's <br />
floppy blond hair bounced back and forth as his body danced to <br />
the muscleteen's punches.  Pho continued to punch, landing <br />
fast punches left, right, and left, one blow a second, as Corey <br />
emitted little woofing sounds each time a heavy fist smacked <br />
into his pale torso.  And Pho was only using a sixth of his <br />
strength on those punches.  If Pho had let loose with all the <br />
strength in his gym-pumped upper body, his fists would have <br />
punched all the way to the splintery wall, blasting through organs <br />
and shattering all the bones in their way.  <br />
<br />
Finally, Pho stopped punching, and stood over Corey as the boy <br />
slid to the floor, fainting from pain and lack of breath.  The boy's <br />
teary eyes looked up at Pho's handsome Asian face with its <br />
military haircut, which was glaring down at Corey, framed <br />
between his jutting pec mounds.  Corey could see the dark <br />
brown nipples on those pecs pointing straight down towards <br />
him.  The torso of the Asian musclestud was pumped to the <br />
max, his smooth brown skin stretched thin by the ballooning <br />
bulges of muscle underneath.  A thin sheen of sweat stood out <br />
on Pho's bloated pecs and arms, and a single drop of sweat <br />
trickled down out of each of Pho's armpits, trailing down the side <br />
of his lat spread.  The sweat highlighted the veins underneath as <br />
they nourished the muscle meat after Pho's exertion.  For those <br />
muscles this was a little cardio workout, and Pho's muscles <br />
really enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Now it was time for Corey to say sorry.  Pho picked up the <br />
bruised boy, with one big hand beneath each armpit, and carried <br />
him over to one of the big square pillars.  Pho stood Corey up <br />
with his shoulder blades against the wooden pillar, and then <br />
Pho wrapped his arms around the pillar, enclosing the rich little <br />
wimp between the pillar and Pho's muscles.  As Pho stretched <br />
his arms around the pillar, his arms and lats spread out like <br />
thick wings, and it looked like Corey was encased in a cave of <br />
solid muscle.  The pillar was so thick that Pho couldn't make his <br />
hands meet around it; but he could grasp the far side with each <br />
of his calloused palms.  Pho lightly gripped the pillar's far side.  <br />
Corey's skinny chest was now being compressed against Pho's <br />
proud pecs; and the wimp's soft, bruised stomach squeezed <br />
into the crevices between Pho's tomato-can abs.  Every time Pho <br />
took a breath, filling his big lungs, his armor-plated chest and <br />
abs swelled out, expanding into Corey's thin body.  Now Corey <br />
could only breathe in when Pho exhaled.  So Corey breathed <br />
when Pho wanted him to.  Pho's black eyes drilled into Corey's, <br />
and Pho whispered, &quot;Now you say you sorry.  For all the thing you <br />
do to me.  Or I kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Corey was having a very bad day.  His teary eyes tried to focus on <br />
Pho's face, but either he wasn't getting enough air, or else too <br />
much, and his vision was blurry.  Corey stammered, &quot;I-I-Pho, <br />
please let me go, I promise--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say it now, or I snap all you bone with my muscle,&quot; Pho snarled, <br />
and pulled himself into the pillar.  The arms of the Laotian <br />
muscleteen bulged into sculptured relief as his chest began to <br />
crush the wimp.  &quot;Gaaaaah,&quot; said Corey, as every last bit of air <br />
was forced out of his lungs, rushing against Pho's face like air <br />
from a burst balloon.  Pho squeezed a little harder, and felt the <br />
boy's frail little ribcage creak against his flexing pecs, the <br />
sternum starting to bend inward.  Corey's little heart labored <br />
uselessly against the pressure, and soon he would black out.  <br />
With his last bit of breath, he croaked through slender, bluing <br />
lips:  &quot;I'm sorry, sorry for...everything.  Ple-eease!&quot; Corey's pretty <br />
blue eyes focused on Pho's in sheer desperation, pleading for <br />
mercy.  Pho held the boy this way for another second, wanting to <br />
snuff the rich punk, longing to feel and hear Corey's ribs <br />
snapping against his chest like rubber bands slapping on <br />
burlap.<br />
<br />
Instead Pho relaxed his muscles and let go of the wall, letting <br />
Corey slide down against the hard contours of his teen <br />
musclebody.  Corey filled his bruised lungs with ragged gasps <br />
as he rested his forehead against Pho's rippling belly, steadying <br />
himself with his hands on the muscleteen's overhanging quads.  <br />
Pho looked down over his pecs at the gasping boy and smirked.  <br />
Doing this stuff to the snotty kids made him feel great.  Suddenly <br />
Pho had an idea.  &quot;Stan' up,&quot; he commanded the gasping boy.  <br />
Corey wobbled on his knees, trying to get his feet underneath <br />
him.  &quot;I said STAN' UP!&quot; Pho bellowed, grabbing a handful of <br />
Corey's soft blond hair and pulling upwards.  With this help, <br />
Corey stood up, still steadying himself against Pho's body.  The <br />
boy's torso was covered with bruises where Pho's big fists had <br />
punched him, and ugly purple marks stood out on his little right <br />
arm, from where Pho had squished his little biceps.    &quot;Look at <br />
me,&quot; Pho ordered. Corey's eyes slowly met Pho's, and Pho <br />
thought that the expression on Corey's face was now one not <br />
only of fear, but also maybe awe and respect, respect for Pho's <br />
swollen muscles and the power they had to crush the life out of <br />
whatever opposed them.  &quot;You meet me here in one week,&quot; said <br />
Pho, &quot;and I see if you have a better attitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you hide from me,&quot;  Pho said, wrapping a calloused hand <br />
around Corey's tender throat, &quot;I find you.  And remember, my <br />
muscle are so big that if I want, I snap you neck like a twig.&quot;  To <br />
drive the point home, Pho gently tightened his hand around <br />
Corey's slender neck, and the boy wheezed.  &quot;Yes, Pho,&quot;  Corey <br />
rasped, paling again at the thought of another &quot;talk&quot; with the <br />
pumped-up teen, &quot;I'll be here.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Pho didn't stop to pick up his torn white T-shirt as he went out of <br />
the warehouse's broken door, finding Jeanine just outside, <br />
where he had told her to wait, smoothing down her print skirt.  <br />
Pho's T-shirt was wasted.  He would get another one out of the <br />
pack of cheap T-shirts he kept at his trailer on the edge of town.  <br />
He smiled, thinking how Corey might have to use it to wipe the <br />
tears from his pretty face, since Pho had torn Corey's nice shirt.  <br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; said Pho, &quot;I take you home now.&quot;  Jeanine just <br />
nodded.  They both knew Pho meant his home, not her parents'.  <br />
Jeanine had heard girls talking about Pho's trailer, and what it <br />
felt like to be underneath the huge young bodybuilder as he <br />
satisfied himself.  She was scared, but excited.<br />
<br />
Pho drove his truck out of the warehouse district, towards the <br />
edge of town.  The still evening air streamed smoothly through <br />
the windows of the truck, and played over the contours of Pho's <br />
muscles, drying his sweat.  Pho thought about the night ahead, <br />
and about his encounter with Corey.  His heart beat faster as he <br />
remembered how he had squeezed the rich punk, and made <br />
him cry and beg.  Pho had felt like a king.  Pho's big brown dick <br />
twitched and stiffened under his sweat pants, his powerful heart <br />
quickly pumping it full of hormone-rich blood.  The brown cock <br />
was firm in an instant.  His sweat pants suddenly had a big <br />
bulge in them.  Pho needed to release his tension right away.  <br />
He wondered what he would do the next time he saw Corey.</p>
