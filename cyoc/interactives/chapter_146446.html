<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Freshly showered Ben made his way back to his bedroom. Downstairs he heard the television on some news report about the stock market which was indication enough to Ben that his Dad had gotten home from work.<br />
<br />
As Ben made his way down the hallway towards his bedroom he saw his fourteen year old brother’s bedroom door ajar and heard gunfire coming from the room, probably Fortnite. Ben shook his head and continued on to his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Once inside Ben quickly made his way over to his computer, the possibilities were endless with the Chronivac. Ben considered what he wanted to do. He was ashamed of his scrawny and overly hairy body so maybe he should do something to correct that. <br />
<br />
Ben loaded up his profile on the program. Once again he saw his generic stats staring back at him.<br />
<br />
NAME: Benjamin Granton Parker<br />
AGE: 16 years, 9 months, 20 days.<br />
HEIGHT: 5&#39;11&quot;<br />
HAIR: Black<br />
EYES: Blue<br />
WEIGHT: 135 lbs<br />
INTELLIGENCE: IQ 137<br />
SEXUAL PREFERENCE: Straight<br />
<br />
Ben looked at his options. He saw an Advanced options drop down below his profile and he clicked it. Looking through the numerous sliders Ben found the muscle slider and moved it to the right. The number next to the slider indicated it was calibrated at .77 whatever that means. Ben figured it probably meant that the number one was maximum and zero meant none. <br />
<br />
Then Ben scrolled to the body hair options in another drop down and dialed the slider for full body further to the left at about .12. Ben started to feel excited as he made these modifications to his body. To have this amount of power was intoxicating and he was so looking forward to being more attractive.<br />
<br />
Ben spent the next thirty minutes or so fiddling with sliders in the program making small changes so that the changes would be perfect. He made it so that his hair was blond and he had green eyes. He clicked to have a six pack, and a chiseled face.<br />
<br />
When Ben was all done he went over to the start change button marking the box to make the change permanent. Ben clicked the button and nothing happened at first.<br />
<br />
Ben knew the drill though he quickly took off his clothes and went over to his mirror to watch the change. Suddenly Ben was paralyzed as an arc of electricity jolted through him, the changes were beginning. <br />
<br />
Ben felt his muscles tingling, in the mirror Ben watched as his twig-like arms bulked up before his eyes. Thick muscles forming as his arms gained definition. From his arms the changes spread down to his scrawny chest. Ben’s pectorals tingled as they increased in size and he watched as his chest bulked up gaining definition before his eyes. Ben’s abs tingled as they hardened into a six pack. Ben felt powerful as the tingling spread down into his thighs and legs. Ben saw his thighs gaining definition, hard muscle. The tingling in his legs continued as his legs bulked up with thick strong muscles.<br />
<br />
The changes continued as Ben saw the hair on his arms thinning and pulling back into his skin. The hair on Ben’s chest did the same, thinning. One hair at a time until his arms and chest were smooth except for a fine hard to see fuzz. The hair poking out of Ben’s armpits also dwindled but Ben was unable to see how much of it vanished, only that it no longer poked out from his armpit.<br />
<br />
Next the hair on Ben’s legs on down began to dwindle. Pulling back into his skin and leaving a fine fuzz. Ben’s pubic hair seemed to be untouched by the changes as he lost body hair.<br />
<br />
Ben felt overjoyed at the changes he was seeing, he was hot. No longer the scrawny overly hairy nerd that he was before. Next Ben felt and watched as his face begin to shift and his features became more chiseled like that of a male model. <br />
<br />
Finally Ben saw his hair change colors, the black roots seemed to fade and shimmer as they changed into a golden blonde. With this change Ben’s eyes also became a vibrant green.<br />
<br />
As the changes completed Ben felt the paralyzation end. Somewhere at the back of his mind he felt confused, he remembered his old ugly self but only as a distant memory. Reality had shifted and Ben with it.<br />
<br />
Ben flexed in the mirror, he felt cocky and proud of his sexy body. His chiseled face, muscular body, smooth skin. He had worked hard for this body, hadn’t he? It was hard to remember. Suddenly Ben was taken out of his thoughts by a loud knocking at his door. <br />
<br />
“BEN! Dad says dinner is done, stop jerking off and get down here.” Max, Ben’s fourteen year old brother said from outside the bedroom.</p>
<hr/><h3>
Ben quickly got dressed and headed down to dinner. What would happen next?</h3>
