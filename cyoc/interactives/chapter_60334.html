<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The wizard continued, &quot;I don't want this traced back to me so I made a spell that will make sure all suspicion is directed at Tom. No matter <br />
how much I demand pictures and packages be sent to me for my pleasure, no one will ever suspect that I have anything to do with this. They'll <br />
assume that Tom is a minor wizard so Tom, you better play along as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike asked, &quot;How do we convince people that we wanted to be dicks? I hate this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wizard said, &quot;Oh, I can whip up a little spell to place some false memories in people's minds. People will remember you and Stu talking <br />
about wanting to be cocks and so the natural story will be that when you found out Tom was a minor wizard, you begged him to change you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wizard added, &quot;And one more warning. The amulet was supposed to change you into inanimate objects for temporary storage. It never <br />
occurred to me that you might get eaten. Becoming cocks was unexpected but I've done a little further research on the amulet. All four of you <br />
need to be careful about your sex life from now on. Your testosterone levels are doubled so you're going to want sex at least twice as often. <br />
But every time you have sex, you risk a side effect. You might become connected to whoever you have sex with. You might swap bodies during <br />
sex or Tom and Jake might swap places with Mike and Stu. There might be other side effects, I don't know what they all might be. As part of <br />
separating you, I've made it safe for contact between the four of you but I'd recommend you abstain from sex with anyone outside the four of <br />
you.&quot;<br />
<br />
All four of them shouted something along the lines of &quot;We're not gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wizard said, &quot;I don't care. I didn't say that you have to have sex with each other. I said that sex with each other was the safest for you until <br />
the magic of the amulet has worn off. I would like to see you boys stay close together in this. It will be easier to keep track of what's <br />
happening. I'm going to place a spell that requires you to spend an hour per day with Mike and Stu touching each other. You don't have to have <br />
sex but if Mike and Stu don't touch each other, you'll swap places and Stu will get the football scholarship with you as his cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom shouted, &quot;Don't do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The wizard said, &quot;Like I care what you want. I'll get that spell going as soon as possible. Meanwhile, I suggest you go meet Mike and Stu's <br />
parents. You've got some explaining to do and I can't wait to hear the conversations.&quot;<br />
<br />
So they got dressed and Jake headed over to Mike's house. Both Mike and Jake were nervous and they comforted each other. Mike's mom <br />
answered the door. &quot;Jake, what are you doing here. Mike's not here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;That's okay, I came to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom asked, &quot;Is Mike with you? We're a little worried. He's stayed over at friends before but he usually tells us where he is. Was he staying with <br />
you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;Mike and I weren't great friends before now but he is why I came over. He's okay but may I come in and explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom said, &quot;Alright&quot; then she called into the house, &quot;Honey, one of Mike's friends is here. He needs to talk to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Jake sat down in the living room blushing red and shaking. Mom and Dad came and sat down as well. Mike's brother Mark walked by and <br />
hung out in the kitchen making a sandwich.<br />
<br />
Dad asked, &quot;So what do you need to say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake gulped, &quot;Uh, do you believe in magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad said, &quot;Of course not. We're rational people who only believe in evidence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake gulped, &quot;Well, then you will have trouble believing that Mike was turned into my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom and Dad were silent but their faces expressed a hint of anger as if they thought Jake was playing a sick joke. Finally Dad asked, &quot;No, <br />
really, where is Mike?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;He's right here. He's been changed into my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom put her head in her hands as Dad rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;You believe in evidence. I guess I have to show you my evidence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom said, &quot;Oh, please, no&quot; and stood up facing away from Jake. Dad just sat staring as Jake unbuttoned his jeans.<br />
<br />
Dad said, &quot;Well, if you insist on this sick joke, you can show me your evidence but then I'm going to throw you out of this house and call your <br />
father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, as Jake had lowered the zipper, Mike stuck his head out and said, &quot;Wait, Dad, he's telling the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom turned around in shock staring at the head sticking out of Jake's fly.<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;It was magic that changed me into Jake's cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad said, &quot;There's no such thing as magic. We're rational people. I'll accept the evidence that you are now this boy's penis but there has to be a <br />
rational explanation for how you got that way. We'll figure it out and restore you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;Wait, Dad, don't interfere.&quot; Then Mike lowered his voice and said, &quot;I want to be Jake's cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike's Mom screamed, &quot;Disgraceful and stormed out of the room.&quot;<br />
<br />
After an awkward silence, Mike's Dad said, &quot;Well, all the experts say that I should be proud of you no matter what; that I could cause great <br />
psychological harm if I make you feel ashamed of your choice. So I'm going to try to be proud and accept you for who you are. Would it be <br />
alright if I get a closer look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake blushed further but undid his zipper. Mike was also embarrassed but knew that this would be a necessary part of convincing his Dad that <br />
he wanted to be a cock. So Mike pulled himself completely out of Jake's underwear and sat there covering his own cock with his hands. <br />
<br />
Dad said, &quot;You are attached by your ass. That makes sense. But you still look completely human. I thought you wanted to be a cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;This skin here; if I wrap myself in it, it changes me to be completely a penis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad moved closer to Jake's crotch and Jake nervously backed up. Mike felt his blood race as his father's face loomed closer and bigger than <br />
Mike. &quot;May I see?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;No, I don't want you looking at my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;He'll be looking at me remember. Besides, I'll be less embarrassed once I have that skin covering my nakedness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad added, &quot;Jake, I'm sorry if this makes you uncomfortable but Mike is my son and I have the right to see him if I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad watched as Mike pulled the skin over his legs changing his legs into Jake's testicles. Mike did feel more comfortable once he no longer had <br />
to cover himself as his lower body was under the skin now. Mike paused and said, &quot;See what big balls my legs turn into. I can stay like this for <br />
hours comfortably in this roomy sack of Jake's&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;Get on with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike then pulled the skin the rest of the way, leaving only his head out. Mike's brother Mark walked over then. &quot;My brother went and changed <br />
himself into a cock just like he said he would. I no longer have a big brother to pick on me anymore.&quot; Mark was only a year younger than Mike <br />
but Mark was definitely more of a nerd who never was very athletic.<br />
<br />
Mike looked at Mark's looming face staring at him and then Mike finished wrapping himself up.<br />
<br />
Dad said, &quot;Well at least I can say that if my son had to grow up to become a cock, at least he became one of the biggest cocks I've ever seen. <br />
You look swollen and red son but I'm still proud of you. Let me give you a hug.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake said, &quot;No, don't touch my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dad said, &quot;He's my son and I'll give him a hug if I want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was awkward hugging Mike the cock. Finally Jake had to stand up which prompted Dad to lift Jake's balls and cuddle them. &quot;This reminds me <br />
of when you were a baby Mike and I used to cradle you in my arms like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naturally, Mike began to harden. Jake let his pants drop. Mark, ever the scientist said, &quot;Hey, we want to figure out what happened to Mike <br />
scientifically right. Even if this is what Mike wants, we need to understand it so we can help if any health problems occur. How about we get a <br />
sperm sample.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake said a feeble, &quot;No&quot; but Mike was already so lost in the rush of blood that he began to drool pre-cum on Dad's arm. Mark rushed to get a <br />
large beaker from his room and had no problem collecting as Mike spewed loads of Jake's sperm. Jake, lost in the moment, threw off his shirt.<br />
<br />
Mom came back into the room to find Jake standing stark naked with Dad cradling Jake's cock and balls while Mark collected the semen. She <br />
screamed and fled the room.<br />
<br />
Dad said, &quot;Don't worry. It will just take time for her to get used to this. Now I know you want to go home Jake but I insist that you come by <br />
regularly for visits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake bent down and was about to pull his pants up when Mark said, &quot;Hey Jake, what's that mark on your ass?&quot;</p>
