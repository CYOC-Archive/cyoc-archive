<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom soon found himself seated at the main dinning table at the Stevens household as dinner was served. To his right was his Alice, the beautiful woman who&#39;d won his heart and brought him into were society and who he&#39;d bonded to. In many ways he&#39;d never felt more complete in his life than he did with her. To his left was Harold Stevens, Alice&#39;s father, and across from him was Lucy Stevens, Alice&#39;s mother. His mind raced to try and process all the things he could sense. There was the scent of the food, which smelled delicious, Alice&#39;s scent, which he knew to be a werefox based on his own experience. Lucy&#39;s scent was similar, but the difference was more a sign that they were different individuals and that Lucy was also a werefox vixen. Harold&#39;s scent was really different, which Tom guessed was an indicator of what he&#39;d been told about Harold being a wereraccoon. And since he was new to were society and was living in Seattle, there was a lot that he technically still had to adapt and adjust to.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Tom, why don&#39;t you tell us a bit about yourself,&quot; Lucy spoke from her end of the table, &quot;Most of what we heard from here was her announcement that she felt the bond forming to you after a few conversations... Which is magical and makes us very happy for her, but we would like to know more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially with you being a big city reporter,&quot; Harold added.<br />
<br />
&quot;You read my articles?&quot; Tom blinked with surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;We aren&#39;t too far from Seattle,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;as I&#39;m sure you found out on the ride over. And while Moon Lake does have a small town paper, that doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t also get the Seattle paper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Tom said slowly and nervously as a million thoughts went through his mind.<br />
<br />
It was there that he had some nervousness, as his most recent articles that he&#39;d WANTED to work on related into the capture of Lionel Ulysses and what the police body cams caught when Ulysses was shot. The FBI and Seattle police claimed that the tail that was visibly seen was a costume piece and used that as cover, but that didn&#39;t sit right with Tom based on what was seen in the body cam footage. He&#39;d tried to press the logic that if it was a costume piece, why was the costume not seen when Ulysses ran out of the warehouse and was only seen AFTER he was shot, but the officers dodged the question. Tom had wanted to find out more, pursuant to his dedication to the truth, but certain things kept turning up that seemed to support the claim of a costume piece, and which his editor accepted at face value and didn&#39;t want to waste time digging into something that seemed already solved.<br />
<br />
Of course, Tom later was personally vindicated in learning about weres and that Lionel Ulysses was likely a wererat and that the costume piece was a cover up to protect the were secret, though that came after meeting Alice and finding himself drawn to her in a way that brought him into were society as well. And while he still didn&#39;t agree with weres keeping their presence a secret, as the world had moved forward since the Middle Ages and that simply hiding until something happened, like Lionel Ulysses arrest, that made hiding impossible would only bring the more negative opinions back as the reveal would be connected to some sort of criminal activity. And as he thought on that, he began to get the sense that if he&#39;d kept trying to investigate Lionel Ulysses tail the way he had, he would have possibly exposed weres in a way that WOULDN&#39;T reflect who and what they truly were.<br />
<br />
Alice was upfront with him when she explained herself, and was calm and kind. She didn&#39;t attack him, and when she turned him it was because he had willingly accepted the offer. Based on that, Tom had the sense that weres really weren&#39;t so different from regular people. Could their be troublemakers? Sure, but likely for the same reasons normal human society had crime, not because they were weres. And such actions would likely be at rates comparable to crime in the rest of the country. Which would mean that the &quot;big reveal&quot; would need to emphasize the good that weres could be and do, and reflect Alice who was good and kind, friendly and gentle, beautiful and loving. But that would be a big step and one that would probably take some time talking with Moon Lake&#39;s leaders, as the secret would probably be something they guarded closely, and that WASN&#39;T why he&#39;d come to Moon Lake with Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;And before this past week... your articles seemed rather curious at our secret,&quot; Harold said slowly. He didn&#39;t sound judgmental, but he did understand what Tom&#39;s articles had touched on, &quot;Which, I&#39;m sure you understand fully why we keep it and MUST keep it for all time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can understand the fear that&#39;s kept it,&quot; Tom answered, &quot;but I&#39;ve always been dedicated to the truth. It&#39;s why I became a reporter in the first place. As the truth is important... particularly when exposing things that have been done wrong... or when people have tried to hide corruption from the public. And I would retain a dedication to the truth and would personally argue that being truthful would be better than trying to cover things up with lies... But I&#39;m not here to discuss the were secret or my opinion on it. I came to meet Alice&#39;s family and state that I love her very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you would protect her?&quot; Harold questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... and to the best of my ability,&quot; Tom answered, &quot;but if you&#39;re talking about the secret... I&#39;m not sure how keeping it truly protects her. The world is growing more and more technologically advanced everyday. Simply hiding ISN&#39;T going to ensure safety. Eventually some were... somewhere WILL get caught in a situation where the secret is revealed and by surprise, and in such a situation, without control over the reveal, the things you fear could come about, particularly if the reveal relates to some criminal action. The thing with Lionel Ulysses reflected that. The man was wanted by the FBI for murder of a Marine Corps officer in Virginia and had chased him all the way to Seattle to catch him. Based on what I knew then... the reveal would have related to Lionel Ulysses&#39; criminal behavior, and while technically true, it wouldn&#39;t have been the WHOLE truth and thus would have risked every were if it ended up reflecting the potential negatives...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold raise a hand to make a point, but Tom was quick to continue on.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that sort of thing could happen anywhere, not just here,&quot; Tom continued, &quot;I understand the fears you have... but hiding from them won&#39;t protect you from them and technology is advancing that there may come a day when you can&#39;t hide from your fears anymore, and if it comes out in a negative way... the consequences may bring down the very thing you fear on you. And if it&#39;s a global reveal, simply fleeing to another country WON&#39;T work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you would favor bringing were society into the open?&quot; Lucy asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but in a way that emphasizes the positives and the full truth,&quot; Tom answered, &quot;and in a way that shows how GOOD you are... and in a way that will ensure legal protection and equal rights and allowing for you to be free and open everywhere. It may take talking with your city government and a much bigger plan being put in place for it... but again, that&#39;s NOT why I came here today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t,&quot; Harold said slowly, &quot;If you wish to have some sort of meeting to express your views... I can set up an appointment for you to present your thoughts to our town council, as we would be interested in hearing what you have to say on that matter... especially on how you&#39;d want to reveal our secret in a way that would be positive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom only nervously gulped, as this was really getting into something he didn&#39;t want it to get into. It was a potentially contentious issue that he feared would cost him any chance of making a good impression. He even remembered the sort of argument he&#39;d had with Alice over the were secret and the nightmare it inspired. He didn&#39;t want that his meeting his fiancé&#39;s parents to be another rehash of that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad... can we PLEASE not deal with this at a first meeting?&quot; Alice said slowly, &quot;We&#39;ve all known your position in many ways we&#39;ve accepted it. But that doesn&#39;t mean Tom has bad points or his opinions aren&#39;t good as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom felt a bit of relief at Alice coming to her defense. He watched Harold Stevens give a sigh and rub his head for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry dear,&quot; Harold said slowly, &quot;between all the excitement we&#39;ve had over recent weeks... I&#39;m a bit on edge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excitement?&quot; Tom asked, &quot;Your town looks like a quaint little college town... a different layout than other small towns, but still rather nice. Granted, this is actually my first time visiting Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It started a couple of weeks ago,&quot; Lucy spoke, &quot;a young vixen at the college became infatuated with a new professor, but he was both married and a Normal. The vixen, unable to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer clawed him and eventually put the whole town on edge and led to her clawing another Normal, and put the Moon Lake Skulk in a great sense of shame. To make it up to the second victim, the Skulk promised to support her wedding to a young Harold Jenkins which then put Moon Lake through a scare regard the her family and the riffraff that hung around them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harold Jenkins,&quot; Tom blinked and looked to Alice&#39;s father, &quot;Do you know him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... he&#39;s actually younger than Alice,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;but the pressure goes on from there and one that creates trouble for Moon Lake&#39;s wereraccoons as well. Apparently Alice Decrux, and she doesn&#39;t know our Alice. I wouldn&#39;t let that bi--&quot; he then paused to collect himself. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t let that woman NEAR my daughter. She&#39;s a cancer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did she do now?&quot; Lucy wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently she drugged a bunch of kids at the Halloween Dance last night with Love Potion Number Nine,&quot; Harold grumbled, &quot;and then lead the police on a merry chase when she tried to skip town... I don&#39;t even know for sure if she made it or not. Just that since I&#39;m on the City Council, and am a wereraccoon, just about every wereraccoon&#39;s been calling me for my take on the matter. It&#39;s slowed down anything else I can do... which is why I was late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one was hurt, right?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing serious that I know of... but Love Potion Number Nine,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;It&#39;s HEAVILY regulated with regard to its use. One can&#39;t just drug someone with it and not risk major negative consequences... And this IS something that&#39;s off the record.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not on duty right now,&quot; Tom assured him, <br />
<br />
&quot;So... other than the truth and the news... what else do you focus on?&quot; Lucy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;ve enjoyed movies that reflect a dedication to the truth... or that the hero supports it, even at the cost of his own life or freedom,&quot; Tom answered, &quot;I&#39;ve enjoyed just about any book published by an investigative journalist on any issue, be it social or anything else... Though... of late, I&#39;ve REALLY been into Alice... talking with her and everything related to her. She&#39;s made me happy and has shown me all the beauty that I can see in were society...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though in Seattle that&#39;s just me, so... it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve shown you everything,&quot; Alice gave a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve shown me everything that matters to me,&quot; Tom smiled back to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of that is probably just the bond speaking to you, knowing that Alice is your bonded mate for life,&quot; Lucy commented, &quot;I remember I couldn&#39;t get enough of Harold when my bond to him first began to emerge... and he loved me enough that he couldn&#39;t get enough of me, either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can&#39;t get enough of you,&quot; Harold smiled to his wife. Lucy smiled at the compliment.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a wonderful feeling,&quot; Tom commented, &quot;and one I will fight to keep... so that Alice is always happy and safe to be the beautiful person she is.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was at that time that Harold smiled again, &quot;and regardless on what differences of opinion we may have on the secret... Alice&#39;s happiness and safety is the big thing. Remain dedicated to her, and you&#39;ll have a lifetime of love. As a wereraccoon, I may not fell &quot;the bond&quot; that is so special to werefoxes... but I look at Lucy, and I can&#39;t help but feel every fiber of my being wish to make her happy, for all she&#39;s done for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
In that, the four shared a toast and continued with some basic small talk while they finished dinner. Tom felt happy with that, as Alice had said, her parents did seem to like him. The &quot;big reveal&quot; would still be something to work on for the future, but for the moment, the conversation remained light and friendly.</p>
