<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley and Kyle finally got back to their dorm after their walk back from the gym. They opened the door and both went inside. Kyle flopped on the sofa and pulled out his phone, while Riley quickly headed to the bathoom. He really had to pee.<br />
<br />
He locked the bathroom door and pulled out his cock. He gasped as he felt the weight of his big meaty member! It must have gotten bigger again! It was about 7 inches soft and very weighty and thick. It was covered in veins, and Riley now had a prodigious bush of long pubic hairs. &quot;This is wild!&quot;, Riley thought. He couldn&#39;t believe how fast he and Kyle were changing, growing up into big masculine hairy men! He also couldn&#39;t believe that Kyle didn&#39;t notice anything out of place. Or that his own mind was playing tricks on him, trying to get him to accept this new reality.<br />
<br />
Riley began to piss and his thick stream landed in the bowl. He accidentally splashed on the seat. He didn&#39;t bother to clean it up, which was something the old Riley would never even dream of. He saw some other dried piss spots on the seat and figured that Kyle also had a bit of an accident, and didn&#39;t clean it up. Riley flushed and stuffed his weighty member back into his work out pants.<br />
<br />
He exited the bathroom and saw Kyle on the sofa. Kyle had taken off his shirt and tossed it on the ground. Riley took a seat next to him; he had to sort these changes out and convince Kyle he was changing. Up close to Kyle, Riley could see the little bit of chest hair Kyle had recently sprouted. Riley eyed the thick bushes that Kyle had grown under his arms. As his eyes trailed downwards to the dark brow hair on Kyles stomach, and the large bulge in his shorts, Riley began to get a bit hard. Riley as so confused about these gay feelings he was feeling towards his friend; he had never had a gay thought in his life until he began changing. Riley had always been attracted to girls, but he guessed that was changing as well. Riley also noticed that Kyle stunk pretty bad from the workout. His sweat had all dried on the walk home, but he certainly didn&#39;t smell the best. Riley assumed his body was producing the same foul odors now, too.<br />
<br />
Riley gained his composure, and got Kyle&#39;s attention. &quot;Kyle, you have to believe me. This isn&#39;t normal, this isn&#39;t our bodies! Something is changing us, making us bigger and hairier! Don&#39;t you remember what we were like before? Skinny nerds! We loved video games and nothing else!&quot;. Kyle looked at Riley, a bit annoyed; &quot;Riley, this again? What are you on about? I don&#39;t know what you are talking about, we have always looked this way!&quot;. Riley was getting annoyed; &quot;Kyle, you have chest hair! You shave! You never had any of that before! You were small and hairless, just like me. I don&#39;t know why were growing up like this&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kyle just shook his head. &quot;Man, you are talking crazy talk. I started shaving when I was 12 years old! And I&#39;ve had this chest hair for a few years now! If this is some kind of joke, I want you to drop it!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s no joke&quot;, Riley stammered. Kyle gave him a stern look. &quot;Riley, honey, this is crazy. Give it up!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Riley was taken aback by what Kyle just said; Did Kyle just call me honey? Riley dick twinged at the thought, for some reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just call me Honey&quot;, Riley asked. &quot;Um, yeah? I can&#39;t call my boyfriend Honey now?&quot;, Kyle said.<br />
<br />
Riley&#39;s mind began to race; that was why he was having all those gay thoughts about Kyle. In this new reality, they were dating! Apparently, they were both turning gay! Riley gazed at Kyle&#39;s lightly haired, muscular body, and felt a strong attraction. This is crazy!<br />
<br />
Kyle grinned as he took one of his hands and grabbed his very large bulge through his workout shorts; &quot;Riles, why don&#39;t we do something to take your mind off this craziness. I know I&#39;m pretty horny after that workout. And I&#39;ve worked up a nice sweat for you, too! I know how you like that!&quot;. Kyle flexed a largish bicep, exposing his hairy pit bush, and letting his BO permeate the room. The smell and sights made Riley&#39;s head spin, and his cock get hard. His mind was telling him that he had always been attracted to Kyle, and that he loved how his boyfriend smelled after a hard workout. His mind was telling him to forget about girls, being straight, and his old weak body.<br />
<br />
As his roommate flexed in front of him, Riley couldn&#39;t help but be incredibly turned on. He wanted to go all the way with Kyle so badly, but he knew that it was dangerous; If he gave in, he could lose his old life altogether, and this changed reality could become permanent!<br />
<br />
He looked at Kyle, with a big dumb grin on his scruffy face. He really wanted to give in. &quot;What should I do!&quot;, Riley said to himself.</p>
