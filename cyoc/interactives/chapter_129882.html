<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
You are shocked by the scene around you.<br />
<br />
You appear to be standing in a large plain covered with tall yellow grass.  The field stretches over the horizon.  It looks like an endless ocean of yellow brush. In the far distance you can see tall mountains, the peaks covered in mist and snow.  A single tree stands in the plain.  A few large cats are resting lazily on its branches. You can see other animals in the distance.  Rhinos, elephants, gazelles, even a few giraffes appear to be milling far away in the field.  <br />
<br />
You think it has to be some kind of optical illusion. It would be impossible for the tiny hotel room to hold everything you see before you.  But it all seems so real. You can feel the stalks of the tall grass in your hoofed hand.  The room is very hot, but you can also feel a cool breeze blowing across the plains.  You are startled when a zebra steps forward and sniffs your hand, licking it with its wet tongue after a short inspection.<br />
<br />
You begin to freak out.  You have to leave - now!  You turn and see your companions exiting through the door.  The door seems to be hanging in midair.  The Savannah scene stretches around and behind it, leaving no sign of any wall.  The sight of it makes you feel queasy. You suck it up and try to catch up to the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  Where are you going?  Don&#39;t leave me here!&quot; you shout.<br />
<br />
The bunny smiles warmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;But this is where you belong,&quot; says the bunny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t be here long,&quot; says the lioness. &quot;So just relax and enjoy the time you have here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You try to reason with them, but your protests fall on deaf ears.  The door abruptly shuts and seems to disappear.  You run up to where the door had been but only find empty air.  You can&#39;t even feel a wall.<br />
<br />
Could this actually be real, you think as you drop to your knees on the dirt.  Am I really in the African Savannah?<br />
<br />
As if in response to your question the zebra trots up to you and begins sniffing.  You can feel its hot breath on the back of your neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you can talk?&quot; you ask the zebra.  <br />
<br />
It says nothing and continues to stare at you dumbly.  You feel a bit dumb yourself for asking it such a stupid question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it looks like I might be stuck here for a while.  I guess I better get started, &quot; you say as you stand up and dust off your legs.  You can really feel the heat now and you are suddenly very thirsty.  &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you know where I can get some water?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again the zebra says nothing.  But after staring at you for a while it turns around and returns to its herd.  You are startled to see so many zebra. Thankfully they are drinking from a small water reservoir.  You bend down to join them.  <br />
<br />
You are reluctant to drink the water straight off the ground.  It could be filled with bacteria, parasites or animal waste. You dimly remember that you are supposed to boil water before drinking it.  But the other zebra are drinking it without any apparent problems.  Your thirst wins out and you scoop some water up in your hand.<br />
<br />
The water drains from your cupped hand like a sieve.  You try to pour the water into your mouth but your long muzzle makes it almost impossible.  Eventually, after watching the other zebra for some time, you decide to follow their example.  You bend down on your hands and knees and begin to lap up the water with your long tongue.<br />
<br />
You feel a bit silly, joining the zebras and acting like an animal.  But as time passes it isn&#39;t the only occasion you follow their example. As the months and years roll on you find yourself relying on their teaching more and more.  <br />
<br />
Life on the plains isn&#39;t easy.  It is a constant fight for survival.  Not only do you have to find enough food and water, but you also have to avoid predators.  Without your herd&#39;s help you would surely be dead.  But it can also be very rewarding.  There is nothing more exhilarating than running at top speed across the plains.  Your muscles don&#39;t seem to tire and you feel like you could run forever, the winds brushing through your mane almost as if you were flying.  And the Savannah can be breathtakingly beautiful.  The hidden groves, the cool waterfalls and the nights .... oh, you have never seen a sky so beautiful.<br />
<br />
The young foals dance and play around you, inviting you to join them. You don&#39;t know how long you have been here but you have seen several new generations being born.  It always brings a joyful tear to your eye (the newborns are so cute!).  You have not had your own foals ... yet. True, you love all the members of your herd and weep when one is taken by a predator. But it just doesn&#39;t seem right.  They still look like dumb animals to you.  It would help maybe if you could communicate with them.  You can&#39;t remember the last time you opened your mouth and actually spoke to anyone.....<br />
<br />
Suddenly a door appears out of nowhere, hanging midair in the wide open plains.   A lioness and a bunny stare at you from the doorway.  They look vaguely familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having fun?&quot; asks the bunny.<br />
<br />
You snort in response.  They smell funny, wrong.  Not like the other animals on the plain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, enough fun.  Time to go,&quot; says the lioness as she steps through the door and grabs your arm.  <br />
<br />
The bunny quickly follows and takes your other arm.  Soon they are pulling you into the open doorway.  You can see other anthropomorphic animals walking past the doorway on the other side, seemingly oblivious to you.  There are also strange artificial lights, harsh chemical smells, and the noise! It is much too loud, too busy, unlike your quiet peaceful home on the Savannah.  You struggle to free yourself from their grasp. You don&#39;t want to go.  Your herd needs you.  The rainy season is almost here and the young foals need ...<br />
<br />
&quot;What the -&quot; yells the startled lioness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you we left her in there too long,&quot; chastises the bunny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!  She needed the extra time.  She&#39;ll be fine once we get her outside,&quot; says the lioness.<br />
<br />
The pair roughly drag you through the door.  Just before it slams shut you glance over your shoulder.  Your herd looks sad to see you leave.  You will miss them dearly.  You drop to your knees in anguish, moaning a little.  <br />
<br />
But with the door closed your memories begin to return.  Fragmented memories ... of a hotel?<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha ... what happened?&quot; you say gruffly.<br />
<br />
The words are slurred and your voice is raspy.  It has been a long time since you spoke and the words do not feel familiar in your mouth.  You understand their meaning but it is hard for you to form the words in your mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?  I told you she would be fine,&quot; says the lioness with pride.<br />
<br />
The bunny is a little more sympathetic.  She leans down and pats you on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, dear.  It was just a little conditioning, that&#39;s all.  We all do it from time to time to keep in touch with our roots.  But if you are really good they sometimes let you return for a little while,&quot; says the bunny.<br />
<br />
&quot;What year is it?&quot; you ask. <br />
<br />
The bunny and lioness look at you strangely.  Then they burst out laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not funny! How long was I gone?&quot; you ask angrily.<br />
<br />
The bunny wipes away a tear and then pats you on the back.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that, dear.  But it is a bit funny.  You have only been in the room for a few days.  Time passes ... differently in there,&quot; says the bunny wistfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough talk. We have to go.  We are already running late and we have a lot of work to do.  There are some people you need to meet,&quot; says the lioness as she yanks you to your feet.<br />
<br />
You walk with more confidence as you follow your companions down the hallway.  It&#39;s not just that your years on the plains have helped you grown accustomed to walking (and running) on your hoofed feet.  Your struggles in the Savannah have turned you into a tough, proud woman - a survivor.  You had earned your place in the herd with blood, sweat and tears. You don&#39;t plan on letting anyone push you around anymore. You are ready for whatever these strange people have in mind for you. <br />
<br />
At least you hope so....</p>
