<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim had a long walk to home but enjoyed his time in the great outdoors. Many a time he would walk alone, just for time to think and<br />
the exercise he got. This time was nothing different than any before, or so he thought.<br />
<br />
Whistled along he walked the air was cooling down as soon Fall would come. He took deep breaths of the fresh air and felt the strength that only people of his young age can.<br />
<br />
Turning the corner from Front street he thought to cut across Mr. mason's fields on his way home. The Mason's ownned an apple orchard, and were in the business to make some really great applesauce. A half mile walk down to the Mason's long driveway he turned the corner to jump the orchard's gate. <br />
<br />
The tree's still smelled of apples and he had to watch his step since some had fallen to the ground. The summer was very dry for the second year in a row and he thought of the Mason's and the low volume in their pickings. Tim was a little hot on Alice Mason, she was very nice.<br />
<br />
It was about then when his mind was elsewhere when his future changed.<br />
<br />
Zip, zing, opps, flop! Tim's footing went out from under him and he fell backwards to the ground with a thud. He had the air knocked out of him and laid there looking up and seeing stars.<br />
<br />
As his sense of being came back to him he had the strange feeling of something about his head. Feeling his strength return he looked off to the right as he heard a snap of a twig. Tim's eyes went wide as he saw the form of Mr. Mason's prize Buffalo bull Samson and his harem of five buffalo cows. <br />
<br />
Mr. Mason would many times let these beasts into the orchard to graze down the grasses. They would also eat all the fallen fruit which would otherwise be a mess to walk or drive over.  Tim lay still as he was not sure of the massive animal. The small herd walked about very near to Tim and he had all he could do not to jump up and run.<br />
<br />
The last light of the summer's Sun was going down as Tim watched Samson approach. The buffalo sniffed the ground and seemed somehow interested in the area around Tim. As he watched and laid very still the big Bull was soon met by his harem.<br />
<br />
Tim lay in a heap of rotting apples which is what caused him to slip and fall. The apples were of course just what Samson loved to eat and was quite intent on nibbling around Tim. As Samson chewed a mouthfull he was sniffing the air, his upper lip turned almost insideout. A time of the year when some cows become in need of some loving the bull sensed some nearby passion.<br />
<br />
Tim stared at the belly of the bull Buffalo as it's large pick penis began emerge from the dark hairy sheath. Tim knew little of how Buffalo's mate except what he had seen on National Geographic station. Now he was at ground zero with a worm's eye view of the happenings. <br />
<br />
Samson stood near Tim's feet and was looking to behind Tim's head at no doubt a cow. The bull took a half step forward and brought his lengthening pink shaft to bare. The shaft was filling out in size and length as it approached Tim's face.<br />
<br />
Looking to his shoes Tim saw the ball sac swinging and seemed to pulse a little. As Time looked up again his face became awashed in thin runny streams of bovine precum. Samson started to breathe heavy and was working himself up to maybe mount the Buffalo cow.<br />
<br />
Thoughts of Tim's past and his hope for a fine future now seemed to be held at bay by Samson's pink cock. Suddenly erupting the pink shaft roared slug after slimed globs of a yellow sticky yuck. The bull masterbated it's self and Tim became the owner of a face and chest covered in the horrible stinking stuff.<br />
<br />
As Samson's pink cock skided through his ejocked slime and slithered over Tim's forehead the young man choked and gasp for air. So scared yet to make any move Tim lay there until he was revolted to the absolute. The cow turned to watch her love walk away and not even fill her desire. As poor Tim lay covered in semen the freindly warmth of the cow's flop fell onto his forehead.<br />
<br />
The bull and harem wandered away as Tim sat up violated to the worst. Still choking and trying to spit out the bull's semen Tim made his way back toward the main farm buildings to wash up if he could.<br />
<br />
A squeaking windmill cranked away and pumped from the earth sweet water. Tim directed the flow to run over his stinking head and down his slimed chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your a mess!&quot; said a familiar voice as Time turned to see Alice Mason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cutting the short cut to home, after the big party no doubt!&quot; she chidded him some more.<br />
<br />
Tim continued to was his stinking face and began to remove his filth covered shirt. &quot;I slipped out in an apple heap and that damn bull crapped on me too. I'm not feeling all too funny Alice!&quot; Tim chidded right back.<br />
<br />
Alice saw her friend looking a little worse for wear so she pointed to the barn. &quot;You can shower in the barn and wash your clothes off too, we have it there for when we get done spraying insect killers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim smiled and putting his shirt back on headed with Alice for the main barn.<br />
<br />
Once inside Alice turned on the hot water and offered Tim to stand under the showerhead. Tim gave Alice a play by play of his experiance with Samson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Tim, he might have stepped on you or gored you with his horns. Daddy just put them inside the orchard fence before dinner. You stink!&quot; said Alice with a smile.<br />
<br />
Alice smiled again and walked off to her Father's office at the one side of the barn. As Tim finished is cleaning cycle and turned the hot water off Alice walked out again with a big smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's so funny?&quot; asked Tim.<br />
<br />
Alice kept her smile and walked right up to Tim. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pew, you still smell like a bull, best then you look the part!&quot; said Alice as she quickly reached up a hung a string over Tim's left ear. Her smile changed to a laugh as he stood with his numbered animal tag hanging from the string over his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, what part of Samson's herd am I now?&quot; asked Tim with a half grin.<br />
<br />
Alice laughed now that Tim was more in the mood for levity. &quot;You number is 7-B! The tag came from last years 4-H pet of sister Sandra, she won first prize with him at the county fair. Hey what's that glowing thing in your shirt pocket?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim looked down to see the charm he'd picked up glowing beams of red and green. As he reached to dig it out of his pocket Tim jerked back. Suddenly his backbone was rigid and his arms went out straight above his head. Alice let out a scream, but Tim was all envolved with his own trouble.<br />
<br />
Alice stepped back as if her friend was having some sort of spasm or a muscled fit. Tim's eyes were wide as if either surprised or maybe in terrible pain, Alice could not tell.<br />
<br />
Tim lowered his head till chin and chest met. His eyes closed down tight as teeth clenched. Arms lowered to be straight out forward and fingers clenched to a fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, Tim, what's wrong, TIM!&quot; called Alice now feeling true fear for her friend.<br />
<br />
Now it was time for Alice to see National Geographic's soon to be special on Timothy Jones, the prize winning 4-H bull.<br />
<br />
Alice stood watching as Tim's face darkened in color. First like he had a good summer tan and then it turned darker and darker till he was as black as the ace of spades.<br />
<br />
Tim began to breathe in heavy drags of air and almost snort the air back out. As his nose flared wide and soon merged with his upper lip Alice saw a muzzel forming. Lips swelled thicker till they looked like those of a bull. Tim's head began to swell, bigger and bigger. His skull grew oddly squared and very much like a bovine shape. <br />
<br />
Tim's ears sprouted outward and covered quickly with jet black hairs. The total head soon sported a heavy covering of Winter seasoned hair. As muscles sprank up to support the great head, Tim's neck gained mass. Now the lips moved as he began to chew his mouth in circles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, Tim!&quot; called Alice.<br />
<br />
Tim's shirt swelled as muscles grew huge to meet the coming of a prize winning bull. A jerk this way and that as his backbone added length to a growing body. Alice watched and began to cry as her friend transformed more and more into her sister's 4-H Black Angus bull.<br />
<br />
As the growing bull continued to change he felt the string and tag flop about near his head. Tim began to sway his head with hope of dropping the yellow tag off. Yet as it swung the string continued to wrap around the ear.<br />
<br />
Alice saw what he was doing and tried to reach for the tag to pull it off. As the bull's chest swelled to it's final full grown size Tim's shirt ripped away. The Medallion charm falling from his pocket and into the dirt floor of the barn.<br />
<br />
Tim began to low with bovine sound and his new long boney tail grew to it's best size. Arms by this time had become forelegs and those tight fists were all cloven hooves. Leaning forward Tim could not hold his gaining size in an upward position. Forced to lean on his forelegs he turned his great head to watch his manlyness change and grow.<br />
<br />
Alice knelt down as Tim's small in comparison human male part began to grow to meet the coming needs of bovine lust. Reaching into his crotch she cupped her hands about his now black skinned ball sac and watched as it grew. <br />
<br />
A worming feeling as best he could think was his human penis bored into a bull's sheath and attached soon to his belly. Scents and smell now began their working on Tim as he enjoyed Alice's touch of his growing balls. Tim made a soft looowing noise as he felt his first true bovine erection press out of his black hairy sheath.<br />
<br />
A tail which to now had hung in nonuse now swung and slapped Alice in the head. She fell back on her pretty butt to sit looking as Tim's hind quarters pressed out into all bull. Leg bones shifted, feet grew, heels became hocks and toes cloven hooves.<br />
<br />
There was little doubt to Tim or Alice but he was one fine form of a Angus bull. As Tim stood there his bull's cock out straight, pink, narrowing to a bulb, he felt his balls churn.<br />
<br />
Walking forward Tim stepped up onto some stacked haybales and began to rock the new pelvis. His cock flayed from side to side as he humped the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim, TIM, what are you doing?&quot; cried Alice.<br />
<br />
Shaking his great head Tim let go a deep throated, bellowing MOOO as if he was almost glad to be a bull. Now the yellow tag flew off his ear and the young man turned bull stood feeling his maleness sway.<br />
<br />
At first a few drips of clear liquid dripped from the end of that pink rod. Then it twitched making a few small globs of white semen, human seed drop to the barn's dirt floor. Then the bull stopped all movements and head to tail went rigid. Alice watched in silence as yellow globs of total bull beastial semen flew and stuck to the side of a hay bale.<br />
<br />
As Tim stood there drinking in the sensual feelings he turned to look down at a crying Alice. A soft bellowed Mooo brought Alice to stand close and pet the flanks of her once lover and friend.<br />
<br />
Tears running down her cheeks she saw crushed into the dusty floor the medallion.  Walking toward the bobble she bent over and cupping the item in her hand she said, &quot;It might be this damn think which took you from me dear Tim! I won't let it happen to someone else!&quot;<br />
<br />
With those words Alice flung the medallion out the barn door and far into the black night.<br />
<br />
Walking back to her Father's office she soon returned with an adjustable halter and fitted it over Tim's big head. Taking hold she led her friend to his lifestyle penned at the far end of the barn.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know not how or why but you are a bull my love! A bull is for one prime use and if you step into the corral there will you find it. Lulu, Franciene, and Lilly are of your breed and I'm sure very willing. I still love you my Tim!&quot; said Alice with a sniff.</p>
