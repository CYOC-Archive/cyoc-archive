<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nurse Laundry was concerned as two other girls had come to the nurses&#39; office complaining about feeling ill and needed to rest. There was no way three perfectly healthy girls could all coincidently gotten sick simultaneously. There had to be some sort of bug or something going around, making the girls unwell. Yet, all her diagnostics showed that all of them were perfectly healthy. In fact, they all seem to be looking healthier than last she saw them... Her train of thoughts was interrupted when she heard someone enter. It was Mr. Suarez looking as concerned as she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Anna, I heard that Lisa came here after my class was over, so I just wanted to check in on Lisa before next period, but it seems like you have your hands full.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Will, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening. First, it was Lisa, and then Beth came in, complaining about the same thing, and now poor Cheryl is here too. What if there&#39;s some sort of super-virus going around and... ahem.&quot; Anna had cleared her throat as her throat became a bit scratchy. Then her eyes widen as she realized this was the same symptom that all three girls have had. Could she be coming down with the same thing as the other girls? She began to panic, but that feeling paused when William softly placed a hand on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you look tired. Why don&#39;t you sit down for a while? Nothing good will come if you collapse too.&quot; The nurse nodded her head, calming down a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, your right. I&#39;m just tired,&quot; Anna said with her voice sounding a bit horse, deeper than usual. The fear that she was infected with the same thing her patients was still in the back of the mind, but she was clinging desperately to Mr. Suarez&#39;s words to be true.<br />
<br />
As he left, Mr. Suarez took one look back and felt his stomach tighten as he saw Anna sitting down at her desk. Not knowing that his stomach wasn&#39;t tightening out of concern but because of Ross&#39; wish.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
A little while later, Lisa had woken up from her nap, feeling better than she did before. In fact. she was feeling strangely energetic. Something was still off, but perhaps the cheerleader just needed a good night&#39;s sleep to shake off this feeling. At least that&#39;s what she&#39;s telling herself to make her feel better. Lisa wanted to let Nurse Laundry know that she felt better, but after seeing the nurse with her head resting on a desk, she decided that it wasn&#39;t best to disturb her now. So, wordlessly Lisa left the nurse&#39;s office, not noticing the other girls.<br />
<br />
Before she headed to her next class, Lisa decided to stop at the bathroom again, just in case. However, when she looked in the mirror, she couldn&#39;t help but scream at what she saw. What happened to her face! Her pretty face that she worked so hard to maintain looked so rough now. She looked like one of those tomboys, now that didn&#39;t care about their looks at all. Who would want to date her with a face like this? <br />
<br />
Dejected, all the cheerleader could do was slump onto the bathroom floor and curl into a ball.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Coach Mason was noticing that everyone was taking P.E. a lot more seriously. For example, usually, Dyllan would be either standing on the sidelines or exerting the minimum effort for anything the coach assigned the class to do. However, now he was running laps faster than Mason ever saw him complete before, not to mention looking quite happy to run as well.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Mason had no idea what was going on, but as long as his students were healthy, he was happy. Heck, even he was feeling more energetic and enthusiastic than usual, although he wasn&#39;t quite sure why. Maybe it was the new vitamins he was taking, or perhaps everyone&#39;s energy was rubbing off on him. Either way, he hasn&#39;t felt this good in a long time. Like he could swim across the ocean if he wanted to, but what to do with this energy? He did hear that Mr. Clark was working out again; perhaps Mason could invite some other teachers and hit the gym with Alex together. Yeah, that would be fun as it has been a while since he just hung out with the rest of the teachers.<br />
<br />
While the coach thinking, Mason hadn&#39;t notice Kendall was lifting with such bad form until now. Quickly, Coach Mason sprinted over to Kendall to stop him before he gets himself hurt. &quot;Hey, hey, what do you think you&#39;re doing lifting like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, s-sorry coach, I guess I was just tired.&quot; Having such an intense and long sex section before P.E. wasn&#39;t the wisest decision he had, but he didn&#39;t regret it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? I wasn&#39;t talking about that. I was talking about your bad form. Have you paid attention in P.E. at all? You could have hurt yourself.&quot; Despite his new build, Kendall felt so small as the coach scolded him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Coach won&#39;t happen again.&quot; All Mason could do now was sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, looks like I really do need to create that body conditioning and bodybuilding club. Got to make sure you kids do it right, right? Here, let me show you how to perform a lunge properly. Grip the weight like this...&quot; As Mason showed how the former how to do this lift, Kendall couldn&#39;t look away for some reason. The coach just looked so cool while he was lifting. Wait, no, &quot;cool&quot; wasn&#39;t the exact word Kendall was looking for. Kendall used to think Coach Mason was just so intimidating, and he still was, but there was something about the coach&#39;s face now that made him more inviting. Not to mention the muscles and how they bulge out with each rep. Maybe attractive was the correct word he was looking for? Wait, no, why did he find Coach attractive? It probably was just aesthetic appreciation he was feeling. At least, that&#39;s what Kendall told himself.<br />
<br />
After finally finishing the set, Mason was surprised that he drew in a small crowd of students just by demonstrating a lift. &quot;Oh, are all of you interested in learning to proper form, as well? Well, as your teacher, it&#39;s my job to show you how it&#39;s done.&quot;</p>
