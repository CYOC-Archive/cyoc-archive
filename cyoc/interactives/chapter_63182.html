<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, Dustin, I like your long curly golden locks,&quot; Ty teased.  <br />
<br />
Dustin dashed to the mirror.  He had shoulder  length blond hair, and his body was tan all over even on his <br />
hairless tiny crotch. As he stared into the mirror, the house vanished around him.  His bare feet were on pine <br />
needles, and the mirror was hanging on a tree in the middle of a forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty?&quot; Dustin said nervously turning around.<br />
<br />
Ty and the house were gone.  But Ty was still watching.  On the big screen Television that had appeared on the <br />
wall where the mirror had been. Invisible cameras tracked Dustin's every move.  A split screen showed the <br />
three jocks house that had been down the street and now was in the middle of the woods.  The college owned the <br />
house, and put up their three star football players: Quarterback Steve Krebs, Receiver Dan Tanner and Kicker <br />
Cory Smith.  They were all at the kitchen table wolfing down carbs.<br />
<br />
Ty grinned as each young man started to get fatter and hairier.  Steve was 6'2&quot;, and Dan was 5' 11&quot; Cory was <br />
downright petite compared to the other two at only 5'7&quot;.  Ty murmured, &quot;Papa Bear, Mama Bear and Baby Bear.&quot;<br />
<br />
And suddenly the pasta became porridge and Steve exclaimed, &quot;My porridge is too hot. Let's go for a walk in <br />
the woods.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve didn't understand why he said that he knew the nearest woods was 50 miles away and that pasta couldn't <br />
change into porridge, but he knew he had to go for a walk. So he stood and staggered slightly under his new <br />
girth. He looked down at his fat hairy belly, and he couldn't see his own crotch. He shuffled to the door <br />
though he was only wearing his football practice shorts, and went out into the woods. Silently, as if in a <br />
dream, Dan followed.  As he shuffled wearing his boxers and mesh jersey, the jersey grew longer until it was a <br />
dress, and lastly skipped Cory.  He was trying hard not to skip, and he was embarrassed because not only had <br />
his shirt and sweat pants vanished, but he jockstrap had morphed into a white cotton diaper. And while he <br />
wasn't getting taller, Cory was definitely becoming a hairy butterball.<br />
<br />
Dustin stumbled through the dense forest.  His stomach rumbled.  Then he saw the house in the middle of the <br />
woods.  It was weird, it looked like the one just up the street. The three sports cars in the driveway changed <br />
into Harley-Davidson motorcycles as Dustin approached the house.  At the same time, Steve, Dan and Cory's <br />
scant garments were changing from synthetic and cotton fibers into leather.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The three biker bears decided to return home,&quot; Ty said as Dustin entered the house and famished dashed into <br />
the kitchen. He sat down at the first bowl and took a bite. Ty grinned.<br />
<br />
Dustin yelped and stuck his mouth under the kitchen sink and filled it with cold water. The next bowl of <br />
porridge was too cold, but the third bowl he ate completely.<br />
<br />
Sated Dustin rubbed his 8 pack and belched.  He got out of the hard kitchen chair and headed into the living <br />
room. There were now only 3 chairs in the room. Ty made sure that the first recliner was extremely hard and <br />
uncomfortable for Dustin, but the bloated body of Steve it now fit like a glove.  The second plush chair's <br />
springs were so worn by Dan's weight that Dustin sank instantly into it.  He struggled to get out, and settled <br />
on the brown leather recliner that was left.  He switched on the TV, and dozed for a few minutes - then he <br />
woke with a crash.  He was on the floor, and the recliner lay in pieces around him. <br />
<br />
Dustin was still tired, so he went upstairs.  All three bedrooms had merged into one great room. There was <br />
King Size Bed, a Queen Size Bed, and a Twin Bed. Dustin threw himself onto the king, and yelped.  It was hard <br />
as a plank.  He pulled back the covers and discovered it was actually a wooden torture rack.  He freaked a <br />
bit, as he held one of the shackles in his hand, and went on to the queen bed. His body sank uncomfortably <br />
into the indentations left by Dan and Steve.  The twin bed was Dustin's choice, and he was soon fast asleep.<br />
<br />
Now the three Bear football players arrived home. They noticed how each had changed, and then they noticed <br />
someone had been in their house.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet whoever ate our porridge and busted up our furniture is responsible for us being fat hairy lard asses,&quot; <br />
growled Steve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, he only busted my chair,&quot; Cory asserted with a sob.  He had really liked that chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not making any more food in this kitchen tonight, he might come back. Let's go to bed,&quot; Dan said <br />
fretfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll protect you,&quot; Steve started to say, but suddenly he felt really horny, &quot;Okay, boys, let's go to bed,&quot; he <br />
added lustily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, Daddy,&quot; said Cory eagerly and at the same time unsure as to why he called Steve Daddy and why he <br />
wanted to go to bed with him.<br />
<br />
The three mounted the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone's been sleeping in my bed,&quot; said Steve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone's been sleeping in  my bed,&quot; said Dan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone's been sleeping in my bed and he's still there, and he's gorgeous!&quot; exclaimed Cory.<br />
<br />
Dustin opened his eyes, and saw the three bears. His teeny weiner tented Cory's sheets.  The three bears <br />
laughed.  Dustin soon found himself stretched on Daddy Bear's rack as the three bears took turns with their <br />
flaxen haired new love slave.<br />
<br />
After a few hours, Ty decided to change channels...</p>
