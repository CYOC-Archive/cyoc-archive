<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karltin slept for a long time. His new instincts told him to get into a near-hibernation slumber in order to incubate the egg better. His instincts dictated so. Thus Karltin obeyed them without realizing it as he thought he was just taking a nap. Indeed, his plan had been a good one. At least most of it. On paper. Deciding to become a female dragon so as to let new instincts achieve what he failed as a human male was quite crafty. Except Karltin had not considered the very power of dragon instincts and their sheer force on any psyche. The witch had arrogantly presumed of his mental abilities and thought foolishly that he could give in to some instincts and resist the others. He was about to understand how wrong he was...<br />
As he slept, completely unbeknownst to him, his body let out a smell. The smell of what he was, very much naturally. A juvenile dragon who had just reached complete adulthood. A female dragon. The scent was caught by the nostrils of a male who perked up immediately. It was a reddish-bronze young male and he sniffed the air appreciatively. The scent was one of a freshly sexually mature female. She was far off but what was distance to a young dashing and strapping male like him? He cast a look at his hoard of gold. He could leave his little cave for a while, surely. A big boulder would cover the entrance well. He then stretched and took flight. As he approached Karltin&#39;s home, the male dragon could feel himself getting quite excited. And the beginning of an arousal...<br />
<br />
When he landed at the entrance of the dwelling, he got puzzled. It was a human dwelling and if the scent of no male dragon except his own was a very good sign, the habitation itself did not bode well. The poor female was a prisoner! She must be! Well, he&#39;d change that and burn any human that had dared to that down to a crisp lump of charcoal. He entered the human home, ready to blow flames ga,ore. But as he came upon the object of his search (which at once turned into the object of his affection) he got more bewildered. She was not attached or anything. How could it be? He then noticed the egg near the pretty female. The human must have threatened it if she dared to flee. This would change. As for Karltin, his hearing sensed another presence and he turned with a start. A dragon! A dragon was there in front of him! A real one! Oh no! What was he going to do?<br />
&quot;Calm yourself. I am here to help you,&quot; said the bronze dragon softly.<br />
What? This made no sense...<br />
&quot;Take your beloved egg with you. We are leaving. I&#39;ll take you to my cave and we can live there, all three of us. I can make you more babies if these awful humans stole more from you. They&#39;ll never dare attack me.&quot;<br />
Karltin understood the dragon&#39;s misconception. Problem was, they were all wrong. And he doubted sincerely that he would be kind to a human impersonating a dragon. He seemed to hate humans. This was very, very bad!<br />
&quot;No! I like it here! Leave me alone!&quot; he hissed, deciding to play the card of the girl just wanting to nbe left alone.<br />
&quot;You cannot! Don&#39;t be ridiculous! It&#39;s a human abode! No fit to be a dragon&#39;s lair!&quot;<br />
&quot;I love human homes! I build it myself. So thank you for your help but I don&#39;t want it!&quot; Karltin snapped.<br />
Was that moron going to get the hint? Alas, he did not.<br />
&quot;A wicked human has put a spell on you and muddled your mind,&quot; he said with concern.<br />
He then approached her. Oh, she smelled divine! Absolutely divine! And her figure was enchanting! Her scales hues enthralling!  <br />
&quot;You are like a treasure yourself, my precious jewel,&quot; he smiled benevolently. <br />
He rubbed himself against Karltin and inhaled her scent deeply. Now that he had seen her... Oh, he couldn&#39;t resist! He trailed his tongue on her neck and cheek. She winced. Ah, she&#39;d be moaning with pleasure very soon! Her taste was absolutely scrumptious too! She just needed help. And some reassuring. He could do that, and plenty too. And plenty more...<br />
&quot;S... Stop...&quot; said Karltin through gritted teeth.<br />
He could see where this was going. Oh no! No, no, no, no, no!!! <br />
&quot;You&#39;ll enjoy it. I promise,&quot; softly said the bronze dragon.<br />
&quot;Let... go...&quot; protested Karltin.<br />
But the bronze dragon had already seized his new mate by the neck and proceeded to mount her. His weight and size meant that Karltin was at a clear disadvantage and could do nothing. His froze when he felt the tip of something bog, warm and dripping liquid near the en trance of his new vagina. Ugh! Vile! A dragon dick! He told him to stop but the other dragon was too aroused to listen or care. He thrust in and he felt such joy at being inside, his member squeezed that he ejaculated immediately as he roared in joy. He thrust more, pounding with everything he had. Karltin, shocked by what he was living, could only take his new lover&#39;s love-making without resisting. He was too petite and exhausted to try to crawl away anyway. The bronze dragon was elated though. The tightness of the vagina was incredible and its narrowness indicated that he was probably the first love of this female. What an honor! The egg was probably a sibling or a poor orphan brought by the disgusting human residing here. He thrust until he ejaculated a second time and slumped on the back of Karltin then on the side, exhausted. He had taken care to push the fragile egg aside. Proof that he&#39;d be a wonderfully good sire, was it not? <br />
&quot;You are truly a gift, dearest,&quot; he said, kissing Karltin on the snout. <br />
He then dragged Karltin to his own lair, clutching the egg containing Jasper himself. Karltin knew he could not fight and was too much under shock after what had happened and what was occurring to oppose any resistance. As for the male dragon, he assumed she was stunned by his performance and that she still a little nervous, What could be more normal for a sweet young thing like that? And that human had messed up her mind. But he&#39;d remedy to that and she&#39;d soon be the perfect mate for a dutiful male dragon like him. She&#39;d soon know better. After all, they were both responsible for an egg. So soon! But he had a very pretty dragoness with him and it was worth it, a thousand times over. Yes, life would be blissful for all three of them and more to come as his dearest laid more clutches. He&#39;d work on that thoroughly and it should not be too hard.</p>
