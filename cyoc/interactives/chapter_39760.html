<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Resignation or acceptance -- Jezebell wasn't sure which one would better define her current emotional state. She knew what those things were. Despite having gained the equivalent of years of training (or perhaps conditioning) in being a donkey, Jezebell's mind was still human enough to understand human concepts.<br />
<br />
It was also still human enough to make Jezebell feel exposed without clothing or more so, with her privates exposed. Those still felt private to her. Despite looking and feeling different then those she possessed only hours earlier, they were nonetheless hers.<br />
<br />
The men led Jezebell through the park or more so, what was left of it. People had obviously caused a lot of damage to the park as they'd changed. Donkeys wandered about, some with torn shirts on their backs, others with remnants of pants on their hind quarters.<br />
<br />
Park attendants were escorting most of the donkeys. However, some of the donkeys were on their own, some panicked while others stood with lost looks on their faces.<br />
<br />
The men led Jezebell to the other end of the park where there was a large building. Men lined up with donkeys beside them. The smell that radiated from the building made Jezebell cringe but it also had a familiarity to it. Jezebell tried to resist another surge of thoughts and conditioning that appeared from what seemed like nowhere in her mind.<br />
<br />
If she were a computer then something would be installing new programs into her mind.<br />
<br />
It felt like an invasion, a violation. However, there was nothing Jezebell could do to stop it. She shook her head to resist the thoughts but they clamped onto her like a vice.<br />
<br />
A single tear fell down Jezebell's right cheek as another part of who she was changed. She worried that there'd be nothing to save if this lasted too long.<br />
<br />
The barn like smell became familiar, as though she'd lived in places with that smell for years.  Soon, it was no longer offencive but welcoming. It meant that other donkeys or perhaps horses were nearby. A sense of community and protection came with knowing others of her kind were close.<br />
<br />
Jezebell wanted to think of her kind as humanity. But, whatever they were doing to her mind was changing the part of her that considered humanity to be her kind. <br />
Some might consider it more civilized; it could take years for Jezebell to make such adjustments on her own.<br />
Others would consider it barbaric. Indeed, it drove home the finality of her situation. <br />
<br />
If they were altering her mind, it seemed they that she wouldn't be changing back any time soon if at all.<br />
<br />
Jezebell was soon inside the building. It was warm inside. The scent of hay and manure seemed almost baked into the walls and floors. <br />
<br />
Brays echoed throughout. The men led Jezebell to a stall where two other men in what looked like lab coats awaited. Scents in the stall suggested a medical stand.<br />
<br />
Her escorts finally left and the men in lab coats closed in. Jezebell knew she should have panicked but she felt a strange comfort around the men. Something inside said they were safe and not to run. The world outside was a dangerous place build for humans. Jezebell couldn't do much out as a donkey but inside was a safe place for her.<br />
<br />
“All right girl, now just stay calm,” one of the men said. “We just want to make sure you’re healthy before we get you ready.”<br />
<br />
Ready, Jezebell wondered, ready for what?<br />
<br />
Jezebell felt a prick on her side as the men took a blood sample while the other examined her rear end. The cold feel of an instrument prodding and poking almost made Jezebell buck.<br />
<br />
“Easy, we just want to make sure everything is working properly.”<br />
<br />
Jezebell blinked but decided not to run. The man had a gentle voice and seemed to genuinely care for her. The braying of the other donkeys in the area calmed Jezebell but also upset her with knowledge of just how many people were suffering the same fate as her.<br />
<br />
After several minutes, the other man handed a printout to the man standing in front of Jezebell.<br />
<br />
“All right, everything looks good. You should be proud, you’ve become a healthy donkey that will be able to bear many strong donkeys and mules,” the man said.<br />
<br />
Jezebell brayed; this wasn’t what she wanted in life. She’d thought of one day becoming a mother but that still felt years off! She was still living in the moment, enjoying life as it came. Thoughts of the future weren’t a part of Jezebell’s life.<br />
<br />
Now she had no future.<br />
<br />
The man petted the side of Jezebell’s face. “I’m sorry young lady but you did choose to come here. You (and the others) have indulged in and enjoyed what we have to offer. But, there is always a cost to indulgence.”<br />
<br />
Jezebell shook her head. This couldn't be happening. She was sorry about what she’d done! Why wasn’t anyone coming to her rescue? Brays we’re now escaping her lips beyond her control. That this felt natural only heightened Jezebell’s fear. Humans didn’t bray when frightened! Her humanity was slipping away beyond her control.<br />
<br />
If she was going to get married, it was supposed to be to a man. Getting pregnant by letting a horny animal mate with her was immoral! Jezebell might not have been much for thinking of any sort of religious lessons but what little she knew confirmed this was wrong.<br />
<br />
“There is another option,” the man said.<br />
<br />
A light at the end of the tunnel. Jezebell stopped braying. she was willing to do almost anything to escape this fate at this point.<br />
<br />
“I take it the thought of bearing children as animal does not appeal to you?” the man asked.<br />
<br />
Jezebell nodded.<br />
<br />
“If this is an issue then with a simple injection, we can change you into a male. Don’t be surprised, changing someone’s gender is nothing compared to changing their species.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jezebell blinked, brayed and then considered her options.</p>
