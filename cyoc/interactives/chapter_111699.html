<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily Walker had a busy start to her shift; with a party of nine coming into the diner, she was immediately thrust into her duties as a waitress by quickly merging several of the tables together to accommodate everyone. Noting down the orders of three orange juices for the young teenagers and six coffees; Emily gives everyone a few minutes to decide what they want to eat while she fetches the drinks.<br />
“Grease the grill,” Emily speaking to the cook through the pass through; “large order about to come in.”<br />
“How large,” the cook asking.<br />
“Party of nine,” Emily answering; “all wer-panthers by the smell.”<br />
“Well get me the order then,” the cook answering.<br />
<br />
Coming back to the dining area with a tray holding the drinks and placing each on the table in front of everyone; Emily begins taking down their orders.<br />
“My daughter wants pancakes,” Benton speaking; &quot;so do I.”<br />
“Blueberry pancakes,” Frieda speaking up; “lots of them.”<br />
“I’ll have the light breakfast, “Amanda answering; “fruit bowl with 2 soft poached eggs and whole wheat toast.”<br />
“Blueberry pancakes for me,” Eric grinning.<br />
“Same here,” Spencer speaking.<br />
<br />
Anton and Esmeralda chuckle as each request waffles. Lila ordering French toast; while Lance decides to try the eggs benedict. Before Emily could take the order back to the cook; Benton requests a large plate of bacon and pork sausages as well. Adding it to the order; Emily places the order up only to have the cook swear as he has a large order of food to cook up.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Anton sipping his coffee;” Now that we ordered breakfast, what’s this about a wild cougar attacking you last night.”<br />
“These three,” Benton looking at his daughter Frieda as well as Eric and Spencer; “had a catch and release hunt last night.”<br />
“I caught a ten point buck,” Frieda looking pleased with herself.<br />
“I got that part,” Anton smiling; “but about this cougar.”<br />
“It was after Frieda let the buck go,” Benton drinking his coffee; “I didn’t notice it until Spencer caught its scent and told us we were being stalked.”<br />
“My dad and grandfather are werewolves,” Spencer answering; “they taught me how to hunt with my senses.”<br />
“The cougar tried to attack me,” Frieda speaking up; “it assumed I was prey since I was holding onto the buck earlier.”<br />
“I better inform animal control,” Lance getting his phone.<br />
“No need,” Benton answering; “the wild animal is dead. I had to kill it,” Benton sighing; “afterwards we notice that there was a broken arrow in its flank and it was nearly starved to death.”<br />
“Broken arrow in its flank,” Lance looking worried; “do we have poachers in and around Moon Lake?”<br />
“I don’t know,” Benton answering; “animal control is dealing with it.”<br />
<br />
Before the conversation could continue; Emily returned with the order of food. Having to make several trips, every one soon had their food in front of them. The plates of bacon and pork sausage being the last brought over as well as the syrup for the pancakes, waffles and French toast; everyone started eating. Sausage and bacon being added as knives scrape along the plates; Benton was the first to speak up.<br />
“So what are your plans for today,” Benton looking at his parents.<br />
“Esmeralda and I are going to pay a visit to Tachibana,” Anton answering; “It’s been a long time since we chatted over tea. And we have something planned for later.”<br />
“Careful,” Lance speaking; “Tachibana will stuff you with sushi as well.”<br />
“I like sushi,” Esmeralda answering; “I always found the octopus the most delicious.”<br />
“Yech,” Benton answering; “I can’t stand raw fish. And yes,” Benton looking at his father; “I know as a were-panther, raw fish or any raw meat is like ambrosia, but for me it’s off putting.”<br />
“So what is your day like today then,” Anton chuckling as he devours his waffles.<br />
“With Frieda’s help,” Benton respond; “we intend to put up a Christmas tree.”<br />
“First,” Frieda giggling; “we got to find the Christmas decorations.”<br />
“Try the basement,” Lance answering; “that’s assuming of course you didn’t fill it in when you remodeled the house.”<br />
“You have a basement,” Spence looking at Frieda; “why didn’t we do our sessions down there?”<br />
“Because it’s nothing but boilers, furnaces and dusty boxes,” Frieda answering; “and it’s one big open space, so it’s not big on privacy.”<br />
“Never got around to finishing the basement I see,” Anton answering.<br />
“I was going to have a private theatre room installed there,” Benton answering; “but using the area as storage seems to be more efficient. Besides,” Benton finishing his pancakes; “a separate pool room and tennis court on the grounds was built instead. But I have to warn you,” Benton shaking his head; “Amanda has a wicked backhand when on the court.”<br />
“And you are about as skilled with the racket,” Amanda smirking; “as a one legged dog in a duck hunt.”<br />
“I’ll stick to doing laps in the pool for exercise,” Benton snorting.<br />
<br />
The rest of breakfast passed pleasantly; Lance stating he had some work that needed completing at the gazette, while Lila need to get the house ready for her brother’s children. Benton cocking an eyebrow and wondering where his parents will be sleeping; he soon finds out they intend to spend the night at the were-club. Knowing of the establishment as an adult only place for sexually active were’s to be as promiscuous as possible for rutting; it put a sickening feeling in him as to what his parents plan to do. But what even made Benton feel even queasier, was the fact that his brother Lance owned the place. And the joint was extremely successful even if open during one day of the week.<br />
<br />
With everyone else finishing up their food; Emily comes back with the bill for breakfast. Benton looking at the cost and pulling out his platinum card; before handing it to the waitress, Frieda gives him a not to subtle kick.<br />
“Don’t forget the tip dad,” Frieda sipping some water; “and make sure it’s big.”<br />
“You better Benton,” Anton chuckling; “an order as large as ours; even the cook deserves a gratuity.”<br />
“Fine,” Benton grumbling as he puts down a thousand dollar tip and then hands it to the waitress; “half of the tip is for the cook.”<br />
<br />
Emily being professional as she takes the bill back to her station; thinking the man could be a cheapskate, she was nearly bowled over as she looks at the tip scrawled on the bill. Clearly more than the cost of breakfast by a factor of ten; Emily nearly has a heart attack. ‘This will definitely help pay for a few overdue bills,’ Emily running the register and swiping the platinum card through. Returning with the card and receipt; clearly looking stunned that her tip was the largest she has ever seen as she hands the platinum card and receipt back to Benton.<br />
<br />
Watching the party leave as she starts to bus the tables; she shows the tip to the cook, who happened to be the boss. Even he was bowled over with the large gratuity on the bill. Shocking Emily even more by refusing his half of the tip; Emily was going to head home at the end of her shift looking forward to an additional thousand dollars to her next paycheck.</p>
