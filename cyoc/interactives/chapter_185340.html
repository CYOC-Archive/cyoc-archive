<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Looks like your house was robbed tonight. And the hourglass are gone along with the other stuff.&quot; she whispered. Mark shouted to his girlfriend: &quot;What the fuck? What do you mean?&quot; He nervously searched through the mess in the living room. &quot;Where did you put the hourglass? Where is it? It is all your fault!&quot; <br />
Amanda watched naked girl that used to be her boyfriend fluttering around the room impatiently. She was also desperate. It should be just fun. New experience. Fulfillment of one of her erotic fantasies not a lifetime destiny. Cute girl stopped searching and turned to Amanda angrily: &quot;Why you didn&#39;t hide it better? You knew that it is my only chance how to return to normal! You unreliable dumbass!&quot; Amanda felt tears forming in corners of her eyes. &quot;I know...I am sorry Mark. I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot; And with this she broke to tears. Mark stood there indecisively for a while. His girlfriend was crying. Maybe he was too mean to her. He forgot for a while which body he now inhabited and approached her. He hugged her and drawed her head to his chest for consoling her. He recalled then that he has boobs now but it didn&#39;t matter for the moment. &quot;I am sorry babe. I didn&#39;t wanna yell on you. I am just...desperate about the situation.&quot; Amanda still sobbed. &quot;So...sorry Mark...I...I was just...curious...and selfish...&quot; Mark braced up then...like a man he was still inside: &quot;We are going to find these hourglass. I will call the police. They have to arrest the thief and return all our stuff to us. At least I hope. Till then. I will try to survive as a girl.&quot; Amanda looked much calmer after this. &quot;Thank you...darling...I love you...no matter in which body you are...you always be my big and strong supportive soulmate.&quot; She smiled and wiped her tears with a napkin. Mark felt strong again even if he was petite girl now. And he felt something more. He felt again his...urge to empy his bladder. &quot;I have to go now...&quot; he quickly excused himself and rushed to the bathroom. He stood in front of the toilet as his old habit still worked. He absentmindly tried to grab his member but grabbed...nothing. He facepalmed himself and sat down. He sat there hesitantly for a moment and tried to figure out how to...release it. He closed his eyes for a moment and concentrated. And almost immediately he felt warm liquid flowing from his womanhood and heard tinkling sound. It reminded him the sound when his mother was peeing. After he finished he grabbed a piece of toilet paper and spread his legs. He hesitated for a moment unsure of how to wipe himself. He put it on the front part of vagina and wiped it front to back. It was fifty-fifty chance that he is doing it right. It felt weird. He could feel his fingers inside him. Mark discarded the piece of paper between his thighs, quickly stood up and flushed the toilet. It was an odd experience but it is probable that he will have to do it several times a day. Until he is changed back to man. Standing up to pee was much better and he was looking forward to his normal state. He wanted to leave from the bathroom but he catched his reflection in mirror. He had to stand in front of it for a while. It was still unbelivable that the girl in mirror is him. His face was familiar but a way more beautiful. Once the transformation was complete he really changed to beautiful girl. His nose was smaller than in his male version, eyes looked wider with longer eyeleashes. His lips were pouty, full and kisseable. He tried to purse for a kiss like a girl. He looked sexy. Adorable. Face was framed with very long wavy brown hair that were cascading down to his still-naked body. Shoulders were much narrower than in his former self - he used to workout and to have some muscles, but now he looked a bit...defenseless. He touched his boobs. These looked huge for him. His areolas were dark and nipples were erect from cold. He raised one boob with his dainty hand. It was pretty heavy. Unfamiliar feeling passed through his body. It reminded him last night of lesbian sex with Amanda. He felt arousal again and his pussy was getting wet and warm again. He quickly turned back from the mirror and grabbed door handle to exit a room.</p>
