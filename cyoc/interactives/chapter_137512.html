<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Will you...be there to accompany me when they interview me? I...I don&#39;t want to do this alone.&quot; Molly said, looking at me with those beautiful sapphire blue eyes of hers. How coulkd I say no? She was my girlfriend! Of course, I was going to say yes.<br />
<br />
*ahem* Anyway, getting back on track, I firmly nodded in confirmation, then displayed a reassuring smirk upon my face and answered, &quot;...You already know my answer by now, Molly.&quot; In response, she smiled back at me, where we then both hugged each other in a loving embrace, despite the fact that Molly is now several heads taller than me.<br />
<br />
Sometime later, Molly eventually received that call from NBC later that day. And of course, she accepted their offer, under the condition that I came along with her as moral support, to which they understood and agreed on. We eventually broke the news to my parents, Joanne, and Michael, as well as Molly&#39;s best friends Alyssa, Emily, and Jennifer. <br />
<br />
They were initially surprised to hear what Molly had intended to do, but they were supportive of her decision to be interviewed on the Today show. So, as a show of courtesy, NBC had us flown over to New York City, free of charge. Though, they had to make sure the plane seats were big enough to properly handle someone like Molly. <br />
<br />
Once we arrived in New York, we were booked into a hotel just a few blocks away from Rockefeller Plaza, where the Today is often filmed at for the past few decades. But, you can say that the hotel had to make sure our hotel room could perfectly accommodate someone of Molly&#39;s calibre. <br />
<br />
Eventually, the day finally arrived when we would be on live television, with tens of millions of people watching their TVs.<br />
<br />
.....<br />
<br />
&quot;...Well, we&#39;ve certainly had our fare share troubles here in Manhattan. However, as our correspondents over here at NBC have revealed to us here on Today, we&#39;re now covering a story that seems like something straight out of a science fiction film.&quot; Savannah Guthrie explained, currently covering the newest reports with the same repertoire as always, as one of her fellow co-hosts, Carson Daly, pimped out in a business suit, spoke with a confident but understandably empathic tone as he retorted, &quot;You&#39;re certainly right about that, Savannah. And yet, this is something that was massively life-altering for a young woman from Illinois named Molly Rhoer. Though, fair warning to our viewers out there, what you&#39;re about to see can be... disturbing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly and I were currently standing behind the camera crew, as the televisions soon showed a presentation summary of what happened to Molly up to this point, as the television showed the painful beginnings of Molly&#39;s transformation into the cowgirl she had become, which brought up small painful memories for Molly, but I helped her endure this.<br />
<br />
I was currently decked out in some jeans, sneakers, and a red plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled halfway up my arms. Though, as for Molly, she was currently wearing a matching pair of equally large green bras and panties underneath a massive pair of black sports shorts, whose pant legs reached halfway down her legs, due to how her legs currently were shaped. She also wore a custom-tailored cashmere beige sweater, as well as a pair of red and grey cashmere stockings over her thick sturdy bovine legs. And to top it all off, her lengthy blonde hair was braided up into a thick ponytail braid by several hair stylists, the nails of her thick hoof-like fingers were painted with red fingernail polish, and she wore red lipstick upon her plump somewhat bovine lips.<br />
<br />
Overall, Molly certainly looked ready for the camera.<br />
<br />
Of course, Al Roker was narrating the summary presentation himself, as he spoke with a stern but calm tone as he said, &quot;Genetic engineering is sometimes a fantasy we see in science fiction movies, such as the horror movie &quot;Splice&quot;, as well as the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; films.&quot;<br />
<br />
But as he said those words, several short clips from the aforementioned movies popped up onscreen, including the famous Indominus Rex breakout scene from Jurassic World. From there, the screen then showed the footage that displayed the initial stages of Molly&#39;s transformation into an anthropomorphic cow, with Al Roker&#39;s narration overheard alongside the video footage as he elaborated with a rather stern but somber tone while he retorted, &quot;...But for 19 year old Molly Rhoer, it became something out of a literal nightmare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The troubles began for Molly when she went to a carnival owned by ringmaster now turned criminal fugitive, Eugene Changes. She went to the carnival alongside her boyfriend, (Name) Avery, one of three children of the CEO of Avery Dairy Incorporated, Alfred Johnson Avery.&quot; Al commented, as the screen showed a lovely photo of you and Molly before her transformation, sitting close to one another while smiling for the camera, which then cut to a clip showing Avery Dairy Inc. Building in downtown Chicago. <br />
<br />
&quot;However, Molly was snatched by some of the carnival employees working for Eugene Changes. They injected her with a strange chemical compound...&quot; He continued, as the screen showed a dramatization of that terrible night, including where Molly was was injected by that syringe. Then, the screen then showed the clip of Molly transforming once more, only this time with the sound that was recorded during that tumultuous time, then the clip ended, which finally showed what she now looked like, as the screen panned up from her hind hooves to her anthropomorphic bovine head and snout whilst Al Roker continued speaking as he said, &quot;...Which ultimately led to her changing into what many of the Furry community call an &quot;Anthropomorphic Cow&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;According to the doctors, biologists, and veterinarians who&#39;ve had the opportunity of tending to her, Molly had now became what the scientific community has considered a &quot;Hybrid&quot;: a merge between two completely different living creatures.&quot; He commented, as the screen displayed a short clip montage of some doctors and biologists thoroughly examining an almost naked Molly as Al Roker continued, &quot;...Or in the case of Molly Rhoer&#39;s current predicament, she has become a mix between a Human being and a Holstein cow.&quot;</p>
