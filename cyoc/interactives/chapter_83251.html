<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cherry&#39;s natural inclination was to follow Brian. He was a big strong looking buck with impressive antlers. It was possible he might even be more of an alpha than Vinny! As she started after him however, she heard the familiar clattering of horns, and rushed to get a better view. Her Vinny had won again! He&#39;d smashed a few points off the edge of one of the park buck&#39;s antlers and sent him to the floor! Was that the last of them? Her heart raced. Now he only had to defeat the winner of this next clash, and he&#39;d be the only undefeated stag in the tournament! Two of the new does were already heading down to show him their adoration. She had to get there first and remind him he already had her. As she started pushing through the crowd though, Brian caught her by the risk and started pulling her away. No, she thought! That wasn&#39;t fair! He wasn&#39;t even fighting, he had no right! She glanced around. Those huskies were supposed to stop this sort of thing weren&#39;t they?<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
A voice crackled across the communicators of every husky. &quot;Due to recent changes in personnel, all security staff are to report back to review your new duty assignments.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack paused for a moment to process the information. &quot;... Take it to the feds it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Sam was still lying with Goldie in the grass, stroking her hair and wondering if it was time to take things a bit further when the call came through and broke the mood. Goldie, of course, jumped straight to her feet and started back to base with a worried expression. Sam got up to follow, wondering what sort of changes they could possibly be talking about.<br />
<br />

Terry had been continuing to try and get to know her lovers better. Randy was an accountant, here to relax and enjoy the weather. Eric had grown up with rabbits as pets, and felt an odd sort of kinship. When she asked Justin, he just smiled and moved up to brace her against the wall. Terry giggled. If anyone asked her at this point, this would be her response too. What else was life for if not the pleasure of having handsome bucks like these satisfying her every desire?<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Katie asked the receptionist if Agent Sherman was still around, to which she simply tried to suppress her laughter and pointed to the men&#39;s room, from which Katie could clearly hear the sound of running water and some decidedly irate incoherent muttering. Apparently, the stress of his situation had finally reached the point that it activated his instinct to spray, but as he was still wearing pants over the appropriate glands...<br />
<br />
The huskies would have laughed too, under less serious circumstances. As it was, they were simply forced to wait, until Agent Johnson returned, wordlessly passing a bag from a cheap clothing outlet to a paw behind a door which quickly slammed shut. Katie would have much preferred to deal only with the once again human Johnson for a number of reasons, but soon she found herself and Zack standing with both agents by their rental car. As she began, Agent Sherman&#39;s temper seemed to calm, surprisingly enough. Anything to distract him from his own problems, she supposed. Still, she had to be careful how she phrased this...<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Goldie was quite confused. Not only had Harry apparently left the park without notice, but why was one of the new hires replacing him as pack leader? Zack had seniority, didn&#39;t he? And where was he right now anyway? While she was still completely in the dark about Harry&#39;s investigation, she was still certain something was going on. She&#39;d have to ask someone later, but this clearly was not the time.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, safe at home, Susan prepared to meet with her lawyer. She shuddered as she pulled on a pair of stockings, the memories of what had been done to her legs still entirely too fresh in her mind. She was going to get every sent those people had, and nobody was going to be tortured in that crazy zoo again.<br />
<br />

<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before the secured van reached its destination, and armed guards escorted Naomi and Charlotte inside. The research facility wasn&#39;t much to look at from the outside, and soon Naomi saw this was because the bulk of it was actually underground. Security was rather high here too, although those didn&#39;t seem to be guns they were armed with, everything was too smooth...<br />
<br />
&quot;Pair of real troublemakers for you,&quot; Esteban said to a man Naomi was fairly sure she recognized from somewhere. Human, oddly enough, unlike everyone else she saw walking around. Was he the programmer Naomi had dug up dirt on? &quot;The boss recommends something you know won&#39;t try to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect timing!&quot; the other man said. There&#39;s a form we&#39;ve been having trouble with that I&#39;m almost certain I finally have down. And of course it always helps to test these things in pairs, hormonal issues between the sexes to sort out and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was the final straw for Naomi. She lunged at the monster before her, knocking him to the ground and- Suddenly she felt an astoundingly sharp pain and crumpled to one side. Cattle prods, that was what they were. Charlotte had gotten the same treatment, had she had the same impulse?<br />
<br />
Without much more in the way of conversation, the two were lead to a series of small non-descript chambers, almost like oversized lockers, in a long series of pairs, and shoved inside a set. From how they were talking, these would have to be transformation chambers, but they were too close together for that. Suddenly, she heard Charlotte cry out through the thin wall next to her causing her to pound on the door even harder than she already was. Next she heard a thunk, and the loud hum of an electric motor from above as a large bit of machinery mounted in the ceiling slid into place. So that was how they did it, but just what sort of experiments were they conducting here that called for this sort of setup?<br />
<br />
Before she could put too much thought into it, her own transformation began. First her fur receded, and she felt the bone structure of her face reshaping. They were turning her human? Just as some sort of preliminary step, or...? Suddenly her legs gave way from under her, shrinking away to nothing even as the skin was starting to change into some kind of scales. She had little time to think about that though, as the next major step began. Rather than melt away as she&#39;d expected, her tail was filling out and stretchy, growing to the size of her torso, which was undergowing changes of its own. As scales spread their way up to her waist, she had a queasy feeling. Something was shifting around internally, and her torso was reshaping itself. Her brain hadn&#39;t fully adapted to her radically changed anatomy yet, and it was tricky trying to reposition herself and see just what was happening, but it was clear her half her body was not just a large flexible tail. Was she part fish, or part snake? Were these weird internal changes she was feeling just the result of no longer being a mammal, or had these monsters done the unthinkable and actually made her male on top of anything else? As the transformation finished, the floor gave way beneath her, dumping her to a slick ramp, unceremoniously depositing her into a large secure tank with a matching creature who would have to be Charlotte.</p>
