<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike stared up at giant Jake.  Earlier that day, Mike wouldn't have <br />
given that wimpy clerk a second glance, but now he was a tiny thing in <br />
the giant clerk's hands.  No, not just in his hands, but attached to <br />
his crotch. He could feel Jake's blood coursing through his body.  He <br />
only could hear the thunderous pounding of Jake's giant heart.  He was <br />
now an appendage of the giant. He was terrified.  <br />
<br />
When he first had awakened in that dark damp smelly place that he <br />
later learned was Jake's underwear, he had no idea what had happened.  <br />
He had some weird memory of shrinking and being eaten, but that was so <br />
illogical. He wondered if he had had a stroke.  He discovered he <br />
couldn't move his arms and legs.  Oh, he could move a bit, but his <br />
arms and legs were pinned to his body.  He was sure he had had a <br />
stroke.  However, as time passed and he was aware of people coming and <br />
going from the store, and from the muffled conversations he heard <br />
through the heavy cloth surrounding him, it became clear that he was <br />
inside Jake's pants. Upon that conclusion, Mike began looking around <br />
for Jake's cock.  After all he was inside the guy's underwear.  He <br />
found Jake's balls beneath him and his eyes adjusted to the filtered <br />
light passing through the layers of clothing. He could feel the blood <br />
surge inside him.  He felt himself grow, and he came to the <br />
inescapable conclusion that he was now Jake's sentient cock.  The <br />
nightmare of shrinking and being eaten had to be true.  He tried a <br />
little longer to convince himself that it was all a dream.  <br />
<br />
The taste of something salty, bitter and buttery flavored came up his <br />
throat. He realized Jake needed to piss.  He wanted to cry, but <br />
instead he decided he had to make himself known to Jake.  So he <br />
started shouting.  Jake's reaction sort of freaked the jock out. He <br />
was now being petted like some sort of hamster or gerbil.  But that <br />
wasn't the worst part. Jake was getting hard, Mike's body was growing <br />
and stiffening and it felt so good. Mike kept telling himself he <br />
wasn't gay, that this wasn't gay.  He was just another guy's cock for <br />
now, so it was completely natural.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did this happen?&quot; Jake asked softly.<br />
<br />
Jake had taken guff from guys like Mike all his life.  They tended to <br />
view him as something intended to make their lives easier. Gay guys <br />
used him like Kleenex. Straight bullies made Jake do their homework <br />
for them, or give them his lunch or lunch money.  Even at work, the <br />
jock guys would leave a mess in the changing room for Jake to clean <br />
up. They were arrogant and Jake resented them generally while still <br />
lusting after them.<br />
<br />
Somehow Mike was different.  He had been this big jock had been <br />
reduced to 9 inches tall, and was helpless in giant Jake's hands.  If <br />
Mike hadn't been attached to Jake, and the fondling of Mike hadn't <br />
felt so good to Jake, it's probable that Jake's reaction would have <br />
been different. <br />
<br />
As Mike stiffened, Jake stared down at the abs, chest and veins <br />
outlined on his cock. It was his cock still, but bigger than before <br />
and with some of Mike's physical features superimposed on it.  His <br />
spongy cock head was definitely Mike's miniaturized head now. Mike's <br />
head thrust upward and away from his body. He could feel the pressure <br />
building up inside Jake. Hot molten lava flowed upward through Mike's <br />
core.  His mouth forced open, and cum spurted up through him.  Gallons <br />
and gallons seemed to gush out.  It felt so good, it was better than <br />
any sex Mike had had before.  His entire body was devoted to sex now, <br />
he tingled all over.  His whole being orgasmed with the giant Jake.  <br />
He tried to speak but his mouth was full and the cum kept oozing after <br />
the initial spurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck, I've got cum all over me!&quot; Jake said in horror. He waddled <br />
over to the sink with pants around his ankles.  He turned on the warm <br />
water and grabbed some paper towels. He was so focused on cleaning <br />
himself up that he forgot about Mike.  It had to have been some weird <br />
fantasy anyway. Damn, hot for sure, but people didn't turn into other <br />
people's cocks.  He stared at the organ in his hands, and muttered <br />
aloud, &quot;Do they?&quot;  It sure looked like Mike was sleeping between his <br />
legs.  <br />
<br />
The cock was softening and hanging downward.  Mike's face tilted <br />
forward, it looked so serene and angelic with his eyes closed.  <br />
Apparently, the massive orgasm had exhausted Mike totally and he had <br />
either passed out or fallen asleep.  Hanging upside down like that <br />
made Jake think of the vampires in Lost Boys hanging from the cave <br />
ceiling as they slept during the day. He finished cleaning up as best <br />
he could.  He pulled up his damp underwear, and jeans, washed his <br />
hands and headed back into the store.  He couldn't leave it <br />
unattended, and he needed a distraction while he thought about what to <br />
do about his talking cock.  Oh, it was kind of cool as a novelty while <br />
he jocked off, but he had a date tonight, and he was afraid he'd <br />
either not get pass the cuddling stage or if he did then his partner <br />
would freak and take off after seeing another guy as Jake's dick.<br />
<br />
It was really more awkward cause Jake's date knew Mike. Jake shook his <br />
head and drank some coffee.  It was cold and bitter now, but Jake <br />
didn't care about that.  He had to decide what to do with Mike.  How <br />
had Mike become a banana anyway?  Jake walked over to the trash and <br />
picked out the spent banana peel to examine it for clues.</p>
