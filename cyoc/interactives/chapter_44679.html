<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yvonne and Sally had just turned a corner when they almost literally ran into a couple of girls. One of them was Hermione and she was clinging to the arm of a girl who appeared to be around Yvonne's age. Yvonne smiled and asked &quot;How are you enjoying your new life sis?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermione clung to the girl's arm tighter and said &quot;I dunno.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at the girl Yvonne asked &quot;Who are you? I don't remember seeing you around school before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because I was changed Yvonne&quot; the girl said. &quot;I used to be your mother's friend Rick. Now my name is Lisa.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvonne seemed to be confused by this and so was I. Rick had been a patient of mine before the change. His employer had sent him to me because they thought he was mentally unbalanced. He had told me that he knew he should have been born a girl. &quot;How can you be acting like a born girl Rick?&quot; I asked out loud. It seemed mine and Jean's observer status prevented people from hearing us as well since no one asked &quot;What was that?&quot; or looked around. Well almost no one. Lisa's eyes shifted to look right at me and she raised a finger like she was saying she would answer my question soon. This unnerved me greatly. She should not be able to see me.<br />
<br />
My thoughts were interrupted by Yvonne asking &quot;But if you were a man before why aren't you younger and like the rest of the ex-men?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do have a bit of a theory about that&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You see i should have been born a girl. Whatever it was that changed us seems to have taken that into consideration. It did make me younger and a girl but that seems to be just about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it would be like you were born a girl now?&quot; Yvonne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I've just used the microscopes in Biology to look at my chromosomes. I still have the Xy pairing just like every other transformed girl. I'm an anomaly in this new world and there are sure to be others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How have the ex-men been reacting to you?&quot; Yvonne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have been reacting to me like a born girl&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's strange&quot; Yvonne said.<br />
<br />
Lisa shrugged and said &quot;Like I said, I'm an anomaly. My children may be even more of an anomaly though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would they be?&quot; Yvonne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be able to figure it out Yvonne&quot; Lisa said. &quot;What did you learn about reproduction in Biology?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvonne seemed to think a minute before saying &quot;The ex-men's clits grow into penises when the born girl allows and our's when we want. When they make an child half of the chromosomes come from the ex-man and half from the born girl. If the child has an XX pairing they will be like born girl's now. If the pairing is Xy though they will be like ex-men.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what might happen if I had a child with another ex-man?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess that there is the possibility of a yy pairing&quot; Yvonne said after careful consideration.<br />
<br />
&quot;And no one knows what would happen with a yy pairing&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Would the child have a permanent dick instead of a clit? Would they be able to change their clit into a dick? Would they need permission for that? Would the child even be healthy and alive? This is what I mean when I say my children may be even more of an anomaly than I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then perhaps it will be best if you don't have children&quot; Yvonne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That isn't an option&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I love kids too much not to have any with the right person and I think I've found the one.&quot; Lisa gave Hermione a little squeeze and smiled down at her. Hermione smiled back up at her and they kissed.<br />
<br />
Hermione's hand was sneaking up Lisa's skirt as they kissed and Sally looked up at Yvonne and said &quot;I really want to please you now. I'm getting really wet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvonne looked down at Sally and smiled. Looking back at Lisa and Hermione she cleared her throat and they broke apart. Smiling she said &quot;Sally and I were going to a storage room to have a little fun in private. Though I would like you two to come with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that would mean I would see you naked and I'm not suppose to see you naked&quot; Hermione said.<br />
<br />
Lisa patted Hermione's hand and said &quot;You still need to adjust a bit Hermione. Yvonne is no longer your daughter and you are no longer a man. You are her sister now and it's ok or you to see her naked.&quot; Lifting Hermione's chin to look at her she continued &quot;You can't hold on to your old life. If you do you will be miserable. You don't want that do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Hermione said. &quot;But I can't help remembering Yvonne as my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll have those memories for the rest of your life&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how come I can not remember what my Mommy before the change looked like?&quot; Hermione asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you are trying to hold onto your old life&quot; Lisa said. &quot;As soon as you accept your new life and don't hold onto your old one you will find that you remember her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot; Hermione asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I still remember my old life clearly&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I have a new mother now but I still remember my old mother. That's because I accepted my new life and didn't hold onto my old one. I'm happy now and looking forward to carrying a child and childbirth. I hope that you'll be the one that I have children with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I want to be the one to have children with you&quot; Hermione said with all sincerity. &quot;I'm glad I met you. You're nice to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you two meet?&quot; Yvonne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;On our lunch break a born girl tried to stab her in the neck with a fork&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I was able to block it with my tray and wrestle the fork from her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But no born girl would do that&quot; I said shocked. Lisa moved her eyes to look at me again and I decided to enter her mind. I saw that all she had said was true and I quickly left her mind. As I was leaving Lisa thought 'I hope you found what you wanted Doctor.' This unnerved me even more as Lisa was obviously aware that I was in her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's terrible&quot; Yvonne said brining my attention back to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Though I'm sure we'll hear more stories like this. Some born girls have had bad experiences with men and now that they're in power it's bound to go to a few of their heads. Hopefully things will settle down in a day or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so&quot; Yvonne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yvonne&quot; Sally started to whine. &quot;I really want to please you. Could we please hurry to the storage room?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvonne smiled down at Sally and said &quot;Of course.&quot; Turning to Lisa and Hermione she asked &quot;Are you going to come?&quot;</p>
