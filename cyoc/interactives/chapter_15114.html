As she sat at the Chronivac, she contemplated just what she was going to do to herself. <br>
She grinned as she realized that she could actually give herself an entire new identity <br>
for her weekend fun. She Went through all of the menus and was pleased that reality <br>
would actually be adjusted to fit her new self in. The help files were a little vague <br>
on a few points but she got the idea that she was able to make her fantasy come true <br>
She then smiled as she thought "I always wanted to be a fashion model. <br>
Now, with this Chronivac, I can be one for a while." She then sat back in the chair <br>
and started to design a brand new self for her kid free weekend fun. <br>
"I think twenty one might be a bit young so I'll make myself twenty three." She giggled <br>
as she mentally added "Since I'm giving myself a new birth date, I think I'll also give <br>
myself a new birthday. I always wanted to be born on Easter." She then softly asked <br>
herself "Now then, how do I make myself into a fashion model?" She grinned as she <br>
softly answered herself "I just use the internet to get everything I need to enter into the <br>
Chronivac program." She then did a quick web search on modeling and after some <br>
thought, decided to use an existing model's portfolio as a base for her own new self. <br>
She had found a twenty six year old fashion model named Jamie Turner that looked <br>
interesting to her, and browsed the fashion model's portfolio for a quite a few minutes.

<td>She liked what she was <br>
 seeing and grinned as she <br>
decided to make herself <br>
into a younger sister of <br>
this Jamie Turner for the <br>
weekend. <br>
She smiled as she reviewed <br>

profile up on the Chronivac and She then started to rebuild her profile into the fashion <br>
model that she had always dreamed of herself being when she was growing up. <br>
If she had studied the program more, she probably wouldn't have made any major mistakes <br>
that would forever change her life as well as that of a certain Barbie doll and a currently <br>
being worn piece of upper body support. <br>
Rather then using the 'Transform To' dialog box which kept a Transformation history and <br>
had built in safety features to prevent accidents, she directly overwrote her profile when <br>
she started cutting from the model's web page data and inserting it directly into her profile. <br>
It took her almost an hour to change her profile to mirror what she thought the model's <br>
profile would look like. She was pleased that her chosen fashion model kept such an <br>
extensive web site. She was more than able to easily rebuild her own profile into a clone <br>
of Jamie Turner. <br>  
She then started adjusting her new profile from a Jamie Turner clone into a younger sister <br>
of Jamie Turner's with a very similar modeling history. <br>
She thought a few minutes on what her name should be, and with a pleased expression, <br>
changed the name in her profile to Tiffany Turner. he also reentered into her current <br>
profile that she would almost look like Jamie's twin. She made sure to add a few minor <br>
physical differences so she would be more her perceived ideal then just a plain 'Jamie <br>
Turner' copy. <br>
She then grinned as she thought "I always wanted to be an Easter baby", as she typed in <br>
'April 11 1981' for the birth date in her profile. She then wondered if she should try to give <br>
herself any memories of being 'Fashion Model Tiffany Turner'. <br>
She needn’t have wondered as her direct modification of her profile's data would end up <br>
rebuilding her, both physically and mentally, into said twenty three year old Tiffany <br> 
Turner, fashion model. <br>
Decision made, she quickly typed into a spare mental inclination field that she would <br>
have the full memories of Tiffany Turner's life as her primary memories with her current <br>
memories to take up a secondary role.<br>
She then slowly reread everything she had typed in and smiled in satisfaction. She then<br> 
clicked on the save changes pull down and read the new pop-up being displayed on the <br>
screen. She frowned as she read the message. For a moment she wondered what the <br>
message was trying to say. She knew that if she continued her own subject profile would

At least until she uses the Chronivac to return herself and her family after her fun weekend <br>
<br>    <b> ???? { Should she continue or cancel before it's too late } ????
</B><br><br><hr size="6" color="blue"><br><br>
She couldn't think of any problems in her profile changes so she clicked the 'CONTINUE'  <br>
button. What she didn't realize was that her children's profiles were directly linked to her <br>
own so when ‘CONTINUE’ was clicked, the Chronivac found two link conflicts. It quickly <br>
scanned the two conflicting subject profiles and found that both subjects were currently <br>
inanimate objects. Since user authorization was given to complete any profile changes, the <br>
Chronivac used a directive loophole regarding general inanimate objects. <br>
A minor programming glitch allowed the Chronivac to use it’s unprotected 'from inanimate <br>
to inanimate' transformation protocols regarding the inanimate objects that Jessica and Jeff <br>
currently were. <br>
The Chronivac’s default inanimate-to-inanimate transformation protocols quickly found a few <br>
discrepancies in the two conflicting profiles and did what any good program does with a <br>
corrupt data file. Both subject profiles were quickly rebuilt into simpler object profiles. <br>
<br>
Up to this point, said objects have received no additional changes per se. Jeff was currently <br>
still enjoying his time in support of his mother and Jessica was happily looking out into an <br>
empty bedroom from her box in her mother‘s doll display case. <br>
The only problem just changing their profiles caused was to remove all possibility of any <br>
end user of the Chronivac emitter and program from ever restoring them. In such a case, they <br>
would have to ship the objects to Chronivac Corp where the facilities exist to build new <br>
subject profiles for said objects. <br>
The only problem was, the Chronivac program wasn't able to stop there. It had found more <br>
then one discrepancy in each of the two object profiles. The profile rebuilds had eliminated <br>
all but one of the discrepancies. <br>
This discrepancy, however, was in the percent of transformation field. <br>
In any living subject transformation, this data field holds a numerical representation of how <br>
complete the transformation is to be. The coded number answers questions such as:

  <li>Will whatever remain conscious? </li>
  <li>Will whatever have access to memories? </li>
  <li>Will whatever be allowed any movement? </li>
  <li>Will whatever have any characteristics of the original subject? </li>
 
Now; the simple object profile uses this same field as a percent of transformation completed <br>
so the transformation could be stepped for the user's watching pleasure or as an indicator of <br>
an interrupted transformation sequence. <br>
Because of the drastic size difference of the field, the data was truncated to fit. It would be <br>
pure random chance if the field held the '100' necessary to prevent the Chronivac from <br>
restarting. Since the program's logic tree requires the completion of every transformation <br>
sequence, any simple object which has an object profile that shows that it’s morphing is <br>
still incomplete immediately is completed to match what is called out by said program's <br>
standard object template library. It's subject profile rework would then be allowed to continue <br>
by possibly deleting any unnecessary linked object profiles. <br>
Just so you know; removing profiles from disk storage does not remove anything from existence. <br>
The Chronivac program just wont recognize said person or object as being transformed. <br> 
<br>
Well I guess I’m getting a little off topic here. Your not reading this to find out what happens <br>
to a fashion doll or a lacy bra. Now where was I, oh yes, now I remember! <br>
