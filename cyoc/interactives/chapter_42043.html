<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jimmy's wrists snapped to his pits and his elbows started flapping.  His ass pooched out.  His back arched far enough to stick his newly hardened chest out.  Leaning forward, his thighs clamped tight to keep his balance on one foot.  The other foot started scratching the ground.  After one or two passes the roles of the feet switched.  Jimmy's eyes glazed over and stared unblinking.  His head started quick movements; forward-back, tilt left, a little up, tilt right, center turn left, center, repeat.  All of this was accompanied by the noises of a chicken.  High, and low, then high and low.  If it weren't an act the crowd would have expected feathers by now.<br />
<br />
As it lasted the crowd laughed.  They laughed because Loki laughed.  Jimmy did not laugh.  If he smirked, if he smiled, if he enjoyed what he was doing, he would fail.  The crowd stopped laughing.  And still Jimmy clucked.<br />
<br />
Loki laughed.  Loki gazed.  Loki reveled.  And Jimmy was a chicken.  &quot;Very good, boy, very good.&quot;  And Jimmy was still a chicken.  &quot;Even better.  Now you can stop.&quot;  And stop Jimmy did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I offered you a wish, did I not?  Who do you want to use it on, you or your girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will use it for my girl,&quot; Jimmy said quietly, trying not to look out at the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, how generous, Jimmy.  That was it right, generosity?  Or, are you just trying to pass anything bad onto someone else?&quot;  Loki could be such a cad sometimes.<br />
<br />
Jimmy was silent.  Maybe that was what he wanted to do, and maybe his silence was assent to the truth.  Then again, maybe Jimmy was scared.  Either way Jimmy could not bring himself to look at Loki or out at the crowd where his girl waited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come one up here, Jimmy,&quot; Loki said.  Jimmy had seemed to have shrunk away from Loki and was a good five steps away.  &quot;I promise that I will do nothing bad to your girl.  I am nothing if not a man of my word.&quot;  That was likely a lie but it would be dangerous to point it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Jimmy, tell me what you want to change about your girl.&quot;  Loki's car man smile was back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like her big boobs,&quot; Jimmy said.  There may have been some freeing of his tongue to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've done boobs, Jimmy.  Those are new.  Pick something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like her hair,&quot; Jimmy gushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hair is too easy, Jim.  I am offering you something big.  I know it's there inside of you, just below the surface.  What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her waist,&quot; Jimmy huffed.  He blushed a little, and there was snicker in the crowd.  &quot;I like how her dress makes her waist seems so small tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki could finally tell which girl Jimmy had been looking to.  She was petite and demure.  She had shiny dark hair styled in an up-do with glitter.  Her eyes were smokey dark circles of light blue.  Her lips frosted and glossy.  She had perfect skin thanks to Loki and melons on her chest also.  The latter were pushed together tightly creating a long crease of cleavage.  The cups of her corset style dress must have once been stylish and conservative.  Now they threatened to sill their secrets to the whole class.  That being, just how nice are her nipples.  Loki made sure that the answer to that could not have been anything other than: dark, sweet, sensitive and ready become erect at a deep breath.  The rest of the girl was normal, though the dress she wore pulled in rather tightly at her waist and then poofed out over her hips.  It was an fashion illusion to make her look shapely.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like that, Jimmy, small waists?&quot;  Loki said turning back to his current prey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you like corsets, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You like how they look right?  How they make women look, right?  How corsets make women look feminine and small and sexy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  I like how they also make the girl stand up straight and stick out their breasts, too.&quot;  Jimmy was lost in a dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, like a doll, Jimmy?  Small waist, stiff back, boobs out.  Even when nude?  Jimmy is that what you wish?&quot;  Loki had him now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that is what I wish my girlfriend was like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Done.&quot;  Loki said with finality and turned to the girl as Jimmy came out of his trance.<br />
<br />
For the girl, the word was a cause for shock.  It was like two great, invisible hands had suddenly grabbed her entire body.  They held her still from hips to her shoulders.  Only her head and arms were free to move; her feet seemed fixed to the spot.  Then the fingers of the hands squeezed.  More so around her waist and stomach than around her hips but it felt as if mighty strong loops of leather were being pulled tighter by the second.  She could feel her stomach shrink.  Her insides seemed to squish and move in a way that was unpleasant but not painful.  She exhaled loudly then inhaled again drawing her rib-cage up where it stayed.  The mystical fingers continued their relentless squeeze.  In a moment she was sure that what she had eaten earlier would soon be coming out of her one way or the other.  But everything stayed down.  She tried to flex her stomach muscles against the force to little avail.  She expected to feel her ribs crack but they seemed to have gone flexible and had been re-shaped to the hands will.  Then the hands stopped.<br />
<br />
The girl could feel her dress loose about her.  It had been tight before and now there was definitely space down there.  How much space remained to be seen.  Her hands probed gently at her stomach and her waist.  She pushed the dress in to where her belly button should have been and found it an inch back.  The stiff upper body of her dress remained standing  around her torso, perched on her hips.  With both hands she crushed the waist of her dress around her new body to find that her thumbs met by her spine and her index-fingers were apart by a single inch.  She had small hands, too, she thought.  Jimmy's hands would have no problem holding the entirety of her tiny waist.  She tried to bulge her stomach out and found it forcibly confined.  Bending forward she could not believe how many inches she had lost from her waist.  Her hips seemed so wide now.  She was wasp-waisted now, like a woman from Victorian times but with out the whale bones keeping her that way.<br />
<br />
Now she felt something new.  At the base of her spine a new tingling feeling formed.  Like a ghostly finger started to drag itself up her back.  The finger moved up to her shoulder blades and stopped at her neck.  Where it passed a shiver ran across her back and it made her stand up straight and tall.  When it was gone she found she could no longer bend.  Her head could move, her arms could pivot at the shoulders and her legs could bend at the hips.  But her body was fixed.  With all her might she tried to bend forward at her stomach.  She achieved a limited success but found holding that position to be too tiresome and she soon relaxed back into her up right position.  Then it was as if two hands cupped her breasts and forced them together.  On their own, with no clothing aides, her melon-sized, un-sagging (thanks to Loki) breasts, formed a valley of cleavage.  It was as if she were still wearing a push-up bra only she was not and it did not seem that her breasts intended to move from this new position anymore than her other body parts.  She hardly noticed when a new pair of hands forced her shoulders back and curved her spine to thrust her breasts out to their maximum.  This new posture was her normal resting state now, no matter how contrived and silly it looked.<br />
<br />
Jimmy's eyes were popping.  His girlfriend was a doll.  And her nipples were now visible over the slowly collapsing dress.  She sighed deeply, and they jumped to attention.<br />
<br />
Loki laughed.</p>
