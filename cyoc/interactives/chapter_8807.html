<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty’s Power – Remote Control Ricky – by scriptboy<br />
<br />
It was a Tuesday morning, at the parking lot at Ty and Peter’s high school. Ty and Peter had just arrived at school, and they were trying to navigate around the long line of cars that was pulling in to the parking lot. Teachers were searching for their spots while parents were dropping off their kids everywhere. Occasionally you could hear a parent complain about the school, their child, or the traffic in front of the school. <br />
<br />
One lady, driving an old Ford, almost ran over Ty and slammed hard on her brakes! Ty was startled, but Peter held on to him. “Hey kid”, the lady called out to him. Ty walked up to the driver’s side window of the car, just as the lady rolled down her window. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry for scaring you, son. I was kind of preoccupied. Are you alright?” she asked Ty. She almost seemed to me or in shock than Ty! “Yes, ma’am, I’m alright” Ty answered her calmly. “Hey, are you in Ricky’s class, by chance?” she asked him. He thought for a moment and remembered that there was a tall, skinny kid named Ricky who was in several of his classes. “Yes, ma’am. I think I have math and history with Ricky!” he answered the concerned lady. <br />
<br />
The lady opened her car door and she got out of her car. She looked like she was in her fifties and she was rather heavy. She was over six feet tall, and she had several wrinkles on her face. She faced Ty directly, while Peter was standing next to him. “I’m Ricky’s mother. May I ask you a big favor?” Ty just shrugged and nodded. “You know, Ricky’s been having a hard time lately. His father and I just got divorced and his grandfather just passed away two months ago. Ricky has asthma and he has been drinking, smoking, and hanging out with this gang called the ‘Red Rangers’. I just need someone to be a great friend to him and to talk to him. Could you do that for me?” the lady politely asked Ty. <br />
<br />
Ty noticed that she was fighting hard to hold back the tears while she was talking to him. He held his left hand behind his back and silently wished for a handkerchief. Then he politely offered it to her, and she used it to wipe the tears from her face. Ty had compassion on her, and felt as if he just couldn’t say no to her. “I’ll spend some time with him, and so will Peter, who is my cousin,” Ty answered. “Thank you, my son. What is your name?” she asked him, as she opened the door of her car and sat back down in the driver’s seat. “I’m Tyler, Ty for short. And this is my cousin Peter!” Ty responded, pointing his finger at Peter. “Whatever you boys can do for him, will be greatly appreciated. I would like to invite you over for dinner tonight, is that alright?” the lady asked him. “Sure! Don’t worry; we’ll take care of Ricky. I promise, we’ll keep our eyes on him, right cousin?” Ty asked, as he turned towards Peter. “Right, we won’t leave him out of our site!” Peter responded, giving Ty a wink.<br />
<br />
The lady thanked the boys and drove off, and Ty and Peter continued to walk towards the main building. “So how are you going to do this?” Peter asked Ty. “Easy, we will take charge and we will pay him a few visits per day, just to see how he’s doing. I wish that whenever I close my eyes, I’ll see through his eyes and I’ll see and hear everything he sees and hears, so that I can take control of his body whenever I see the need!” Ty said. <br />
<br />
Ty closed his eyes and got a vision of a classroom. “Good, he’s in the classroom already. Well, I’ll go join him in class! See you later, Peter!” Ty said, as he entered one of the rooms. Peter continued walking down the hallway so he could go to his first class as well.<br />
<br />
Ty sat right next to Ricky. “Hey Ricky, how goes?” he said, to the skinny teen who was wearing a baseball cap. He looked terrible, like he didn’t sleep all night. His eyes were red, and his face was kind of pale. “Are you okay, dude? You don’t look too hot!” Ty continued. Ricky turned towards Ty. “Oh shut up Tyler. Just leave me alone!” he said calmly.<br />
<br />
“Now, now Ricky! We’re going to be friends from now and you’re always going to talk to me and be completely honest with me!” Ty wished out loud. Suddenly Ricky’s attitude towards Ty had changed. “I’m sorry, Ty. I’m just feeling bummed out and I really don’t want to be here right now!” he said, suddenly feeling the need to be open and honest with Ty.<br />
<br />
“I want us to be friends, Ricky! I’m going to take care of you.” Ty said with a smile on his face, looking Ricky straight in the eye. Of course Ricky had no idea what he was talking about, but somehow he didn’t feel like arguing with Ty. “Whatever…” was all he could say.<br />
<br />
During lunch, Ty decided to sit way back in the corner in the cafeteria, so he could be by himself. He decided to check in with Ricky for the first time. He got a vision in his mind of Ricky walking out on the parking lot in front of the school. There, he was supposed to meet with Adam, Keith and Dave, his friends from the ‘Red Rangers’ club, who sold him drugs and alcohol.<br />
<br />
While Ricky was standing at the parking lot waiting for them, Ty decided to speak into his mind. “Ricky, Ricky… What are you doing out here on the parking lot? Why aren’t you eating lunch?” Ty’s voice said. Ricky turned around, and then looked both ways. ‘Huh? Is that Ty? Where are you?” he said, feeling confused. “I’m inside of you, Ricky. Why are you out here? Why are you waiting for those three bullies?” Ty’s voice responded. Ricky looked around again. “What the heck is this? I must be hearing things…” he wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“You’re not going to buy drugs from those guys, Ricky! I won’t let you…” Ty’s voice said, inside Ricky’s head. Ricky turned around again, as he was beginning to feel scared. “Where are you, Ty? Come out! Or else leave me alone! I’ll do whatever I want!” Ricky yelled out loud. <br />
<br />
“Oh really?” Ty’s voice responded. “It so happens to be that I’m in control of you now, my dear Ricky. I can make you do whatever I want!” he continued. Ricky turned around and became angry. “Leave me alone Ty! Go away! I know you’re hiding over here somewhere!” he shouted. <br />
<br />
“Alright, tough guy! Just for that, you’re going to give me ten push-ups!” Ty’s voice responded calmly. Suddenly an invisible force took over Ricky’s body, and he dropped on the pavement of the parking lot and began to do push-ups on the lot! He heard Ty’s voice count out loud. “One… Two… Three…” He tried to fight it, but his own body wasn’t listening to him! Ricky began to cry out loud, in between each push-up. “What… is… this...? Stop… doing… this!” he said, until Ty finally counted to ten and made him stand on his feet again. “Good boy! You see? I knew you’d listen to me!” Ty laughed, inside Ricky’s head.<br />
<br />
Ricky stood there, sweating and panting, with his jaw wide open. Just then he saw Keith, Dave and Adam walk up to him. “You are NOT going to buy any of their junk, Ricky! I won’t let you!” Ty’s voice warned. Ricky opened his mouth and wanted to curse, but he couldn’t get a word out of his mouth! It was as if he couldn’t speak anymore! “There, you’re mute now. You can’t talk unless I allow you to talk, you hear me? Now, I will take care of the bullies for you!” Ty said. Ricky tried desperately to fight it, but his body was no longer listening to him! It was now controlled by Ty!<br />
<br />
Adam walked up to Ricky, holding a plastic zip-lock bag with white powder in it. “Here’s your stuff, Ricky…” Adam said, as he held out the bag in front of him. “Sorry, man, I can’t take anymore stuff from you. I’m quitting this right now. I gotta go back inside, guys. See you around!” Ricky told them. Then Ricky turned around, and a mysterious power forced him to walk back in the building without turning around. Ricky tried desperately to scream, but he couldn’t move his lips or his tongue! And his legs were making him walk into the building, against his will!<br />
<br />
Adam just stood there, and walked away. He had no idea what had come over Ricky. To him, it looked like he was a zombie or something. Then something entered his mind. “He was probably not feeling well, I guess!” and Adam, Keith and Dave just forgot about Ricky and walked off. They were unaware of the fact that Ty had erased this experience from their memory. <br />
<br />
Once he was inside the building, Ricky realized that he could walk again. Ty left him standing in the doorway, when Ricky was able to control his own body again. Ricky looked at the clock and realized that the next class was going to start in five minutes, but he decided to skip it and to have a cigarette outside instead. He walked out the back entrance of the building and grabbed a pack of cigarettes out of his backpack. “Oh, oh, Ricky! What are you doing out here?” Ty’s voice said once more. <br />
<br />
Ricky became angry! “I’m skipping class so I can smoke, okay? Leave me alone, Ty! Get lost!” he shouted out loud. “You’re not smoking any cigarettes, Ricky! I won’t allow it!” Ty said again. Ricky grabbed his lighter and lit a cigarette in defiance. Suddenly the entire pack caught on fire, forcing Ricky to drop the pack on the grass field! Moments later, the pack of cigarettes disappeared before his very eyes! “What the heck…?” Ricky wondered out loud, still having one cigarette in his mouth. “Take that thing out of your mouth, Ricky! You got asthma, you shouldn’t be smoking that stuff anyway!” Ty’s voice said. <br />
<br />
“Who are you? My mother? Go away and leave me alone!” Ricky shouted out loud. “No, Ricky, I’m your guardian angel. And you must obey me; I can make you throw it away!” Ty’s voice responded. <br />
<br />
Suddenly Ricky’s body froze. He couldn’t move his legs or his arms at all! He started hopping in the air five times, jumping and landing on the balls of his feet. “Ahhh, isn’t that cool? I made you jump five times! Hehehe….” Ty’s voice said. “Now you’re going to walk over to that trash can over there…” Ty ordered, making Ricky walk over to the big round trash can. “Kiss the lighter and the cigarettes goodbye!”  Ty ordered. Ricky took the cigarette out of his mouth and threw it in the trash can. Then he tossed the lighter in it too. “You will never smoke another cigarette again!” Ty said, and suddenly he lost all his craving for cigarettes. As a matter of fact, he found cigarettes disgusting and awful from that moment on. “Now, Ricky, grab your backpack and come sit next to me in history class.” Ty finished, and Ricky obeyed him blindly, until he sat down next to Ty in history class. “Aren’t you feeling better now?” Ty asked him, with a grin on his face. Ricky just looked back at with a very frightened look on his face. He didn’t dare talk to Ty, for he somehow knew that Ty was in control of his mind and his body.<br />
<br />
“When you go home this afternoon, I’ll check up on you from time to time. And if I’m too busy, then Peter will help you out. You’d better hope it’s me, because when Peter takes over, he really controls you completely! He will control your mind, your stomach, your hands, your eyes, and your… you know…” Ty warned him. <br />
<br />
“Why are you doing this to me? Why are you helping me, anyway? I haven’t done anything for you!” Ricky asked Ty. “Because I want to be your friend and I don’t want to see you get hurt. And I have also promised someone that I would look after you when you’re here at school and at home by yourself” Ty responded, making Ricky feel content with that answer so he would not ask any more questions.<br />
<br />
That afternoon, Ricky walked home and did his homework. He couldn’t concentrate and he only got half of it done. He got up and went to a bar near his house, where he walked in, lied about his age, and drank two bears. While he was sitting at the bar, he ordered his third beer, when he heard Ty’s voice again. “Come on Ricky, you’ve had enough. It’s time to walk home!” he said. Ricky wanted to scream out of anger, but Ty didn’t allow it. He canceled the order for the third beer, got up from his bar stool, and walked out of the bar. <br />
<br />
While he was walking in the alley down the street, Ty let him speak again, although he still ordered Ricky to continue to walk home. “Ty? Is this you? Are you doing this to me? You’re making me feel like a puppet or something! Stop it! Let me go!” he began to shout out loud.<br />
<br />
“Be quiet, will you? Does the whole neighborhood have to hear you? I’ll tell you later how and why I’m doing this to you, alright? I’m just trying to help…” Ty answered. “Well I don’t want your help! Leave me alone! Stop torturing me! Get out of my body! Let me go!” Ricky shouted back, feeling even angrier. “Alright, I’ll let you go. But I do hope you’ll go home and nowhere else…” Ty answered, letting go of Ricky’s body. “What do you care? Just leave me alone! I mean it!” Ricky shouted. Then there was silence. Ty didn’t answer him back. Ricky pondered what to do and decided to go home after all; it wasn’t worth it to go back to the bar.<br />
<br />
Ricky got home and walked in the door. His mother was in the kitchen. “Hey, Ricky. We’re going to have guests over…” she began to explain. “I don’t care!” Ricky shouted back. He ran into his room and closed the door. He was angry, depressed, and he felt sorry for himself. He looked at a photo of his grandfather and one of his father, and tears were starting to roll down his eyes. He missed both of them dearly, and it caused him to feel very down and depressed, making him want to drink, smoke and do drugs.<br />
<br />
At times he felt so depressed, he wondered if it was all worth it or not. He was a failure at school, he was becoming a drug addict and an alcoholic, and he didn’t seem to care about his life anymore. His mother argued with him every day, and he began to feel like he had nobody else to talk to. <br />
<br />
He opened a desk drawer and pulled out a large steak knife. He sat down on the edge of his bed, and admired his weapon. He held the handle in his right hand and passed his left hand over the edge of the blade. He began to wonder what would happen if he just turned the knife towards his own chest…<br />
<br />
“Don’t even think about it, Ricky! Stop right there, because I know your thoughts!” Peter said, grabbing hold of Ricky’s right hand. “Let go of the knife!” Peter ordered. Something made Ricky obey immediately, and he dropped the knife on the floor. When he looked up, he saw Peter and Ty standing in front of him. They both sat down on his bed besides him.<br />
<br />
“Hey Ricky! I know how you feel! I know how tough it must have been to lose your grandfather and then to see your parents get divorced. That’s why we’re here to help you!” Peter said to him, as he gently let go of Ricky’s arm. “At least you still got your mom, Ricky! I’ve never even known my parents at all! I just have my foster brother Dustin and my cousin Peter” Ty added on to what Peter had said.<br />
<br />
“Why are you guys helping me? Who told you all this?” Ricky asked. Just then his mom walked in the room. “I did. I asked Ty and Peter to look out after you and to be your friends! I invited them over to have dinner with us.” She responded. Just at that moment Ricky got up and looked at Ty, who was about six inches shorter than him. “I’m sorry, Ty, for screaming at you. I’ve been such a jerk to you while you have done nothing but look after me and try to help me. I’m so sorry, you just can’t imagine how hard things have been for me lately…” Ricky began, but he had to stop because he broke down in tears. Ty embraced him, and so did Peter. Then they went to the kitchen, where they had dinner together that night.<br />
<br />
Ricky became great friends with Ty and Peter, who had promised him that they would still check up on him from time to time. They told Ricky their secret about their transformation powers, and they promised him that they would both put in an effort to be his best friends.<br />
<br />
Ty made good on his promise the following morning. Ricky woke up early and went to the gym before going to school. “Hey Ricky, I guess it’s time to work on those muscles, huh?” Ty’s voice said, as Ricky sat down on the bench.<br />
<br />
This time around Ricky just smiled. He began to get used to the fact that Ty was always watching him, and he was keeping an eye on him. “I guess you may need a little help from me, Ricky!” Ty continued. Suddenly, Ricky’s body stood up. Then his muscles began to expand, all on their own! His chest increased several inches wider and his biceps ballooned to 15 inches. His abdominals, his quads, and his calves expanded as well! Ricky just smiled as he admired his body. “Thanks, Ty!” he whispered to himself. “Your welcome” he heard in his mind, but it was Ty’s voice and Peter’s voice as well. “Are both of you watching over me now?” he asked out loud. “Yes! You got two guardian angels looking after you. Get started on the weights, and we’ll see you at school later!” Peter’s voice answered.<br />
<br />
Ricky just grinned. He could never imagine what is like to have his body controlled by another person. But since it was either Ty or Peter controlling him, he really didn’t seem to mind it one bit.</p>
