<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jensen lead his small group up to the master bedroom and calmly sat down. The twins, Kaylee, Hope, Isabelle, and Grace stood quietly before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee has told me of your desire to add your wife and children to the pack,&quot; Jensen summarized, knowing full well that Fran knew that Kaylee had old him that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Fran nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you wish to use your turn for this?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;For those that will become like us,&quot; Fran answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice wants at least one of Fran's daughters to become a glass wolf, like her,&quot; Darla added, bringing her daughter's concerns to Jensen.<br />
<br />
Jensen glanced to both twins.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she is lonely being the only glass wolf,&quot; Darla answered the unanswered question, &quot;and she said that Abbey even wanted to come into the mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she know what that would do to her?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Alice did not tell her,&quot; Darla responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, wait, wait,&quot; Hope spoke, &quot;you're family's seen Alice? She left the manor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Through the mirrors, and she remained in the mirrorverse to give them a message I had for them,&quot; Fran answered, looking down, &quot;I'm sorry if I did something rash, Master, but... I still love Julie. I still love my daughters. Almost as much as I love you. I had to let her know that and Alice was our best option.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how did they respond?&quot; Jensen asked, somehow sensing Fran's troubles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abbey and Samantha reacted rather well, after the initial surprise at seeing a wolf in their mirror,&quot; Fran answered, &quot;I was told that Julie was busy and could not come to the mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And which form do you want your wife to take?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you wish, master,&quot; Fran told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would be your preference?&quot; Jensen repeated, &quot;I know you will submit to my decision when I make it. I merely wish to know your opinion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran and Darla both sighed heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can not say, master,&quot; Fran finally answered, &quot;part of me wants her to become another male wolf so that we will still be together, but between Zack, Nick, Roger, Lawrence, and Ulysses we have enough males for now for all the females to share... another part of me wants her to become Darla and my triplet so that we can be more closely connected and we can ALL enjoy you together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen paused calmly as he listened. After a moment he spoke and put Fran's mental debate to an end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your wife will become your triplet,&quot; Jensen spoke firmly, &quot;whether or not your daughters become normal wolf pups or glass wolf pups, I suppose we can leave to them, provided Alice explains what coming into the mirror will do to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Master,&quot; Fran nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your wife is also to be given expert medical knowledge, particularly in the fields needed deliver pups, as in the near future, we'll likely have a huge rash of pregnancies,&quot; Jensen spoke.<br />
<br />
All the present she-wolves smiled and wagged their tails at the thought of becoming pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will however try to wait to make sure that your disappearance as police officers doesn't compound the situation,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;even if we make people other then us forget your wife and children, they will still remember your male form and that could likely make them at least picture a face of someone who should be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran and Darla nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would think that that has cooled down,&quot; Kaylee spoke up, &quot;it hasn't been on the news.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our disappearance likely isn't that big around here,&quot; Darla spoke, &quot;and the police don't have enough clues to lead them here. We'll actually need to know their plans in order to be certain how serious they consider our disappearance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice will do that,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;she can go in, get the plans and get out. Since she is indestructible we need not worry about anyone trying to harm her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Master,&quot; the twins nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;When the time comes,&quot; Jensen then continued, &quot;Alice will take both of you to your old home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both of us, Master?&quot; Darla asked, &quot;but I no longer have my turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll all be together when Fran's wife becomes your triplet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will also gather all legal documentation that you have and of course your financial information so the shadows can put it with those of the Perkins family here in the manor,&quot; Jensen instructed, &quot;and you will finish with either turning  your children into pups or having Alice  bring them into the mirrorverse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about personal effects?&quot; Fran asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such as?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chester,&quot; Fran answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fran's dog,&quot; Darla added, &quot;a Chihuahua.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He'll likely look up to all of us,&quot; Hope quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;He looks up to almost everything,&quot; Fran managed a slight chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't mind,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;perhaps great grandfather will enjoy having a fellow four legged canine around... although we'll all have to be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, master,&quot; came the unanimous response.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if your wife goes looking for you?&quot; Grace asked sounding curious about any potential holes in the current plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think that that she'd...&quot; Fran began.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've already said you still love your family, and that is why you wish to bring them into the pack,&quot; Grace explained, &quot;does your wife love you? Or at least the old you, anyway?&quot; Fran nodded. &quot;Well, if I were in her shoes, and someone came and made Jensen go away suddenly and without explaining anything to us, I'd eventually go looking for him. What if your wife decides to do the same?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Fran ended up whimpering, for fear that Julie would never join them, &quot;we made sure no one knew we were coming here when we left the Perkins home, which was roughly the last time I had talked with her. If she's gone looking for me... she could... she...&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla put a paw on her twin's shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;She could end up going anywhere,&quot; Fran finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt that,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;If what Alice told you is true, your wife is still in Glendale. Which means she is where she needs to be. We can easily get to her, possibly sooner rather then later. Depending on what Alice is able to find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She could end up out here anyway,&quot; Isabelle spoke up, as all eyes turned to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; Darla and Fran asked, &quot;we covered up everything...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And my dentist won't connect me to Fran and Darla's disappearance to tell her, if she uses the same dentist,&quot; Jensen added.<br />
<br />
&quot;No not like that,&quot; Isabelle spoke, &quot;Master, remember when my cousin went missing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your family was heartbroken,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;although, you never told me what happened after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my Aunt and Uncle contacted this woman... I think she is called Serenity, but don't hold me too that, they contacted her and she somehow managed to find my cousin,&quot; Isabelle explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently someone had plaid the game with him and turned him into a mouse,&quot; Isabelle answered, &quot;and that was the last I was able to hear. Either he's alone somewhere or inside a cage... my Aunt and Uncle didn't tell my parents many of the following details.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you think this Serenity woman would find us?&quot; Darla asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's possible,&quot; Isabelle spoke, &quot;She might lead your wife here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that happens we'll transform her here and then send them to recover the children,&quot; Jensen instructed, &quot;and Serenity can have the choice of either joining us... or disappearing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Master,&quot; the she-wolves nodded, &quot;shall we fetch Alice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can wait until tomorrow,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;as there are other things to do...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen then gave a very confident smile. And eyed the gathered group of females. They smiled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isabelle, Grace, why don't you go check on Zack,&quot; Kaylee instructed, &quot;make sure that he's recovered from whatever Nicole did to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Alpha Female,&quot; Grace and Isabelle nodded and left the room.<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Nicole,&quot; Nick said weakly, &quot;the shadows wouldn't let me near their computer, and the family doesn't have any books on bodybuilding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicole gave a growling sigh. But let it go.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll keep trying?&quot; Nicole asked as she pulled Nick closer to her as Megan, Beatrice, Alexandra, and Anne sat on one of the mattresses that had been pushed together to make one large bed out of several smaller ones for the she-wolves to sleep in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Nick answered, &quot;Roger and Lawrence are my friends. It wouldn't be fair to them if they don't get a shot at some action.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of which...&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you all know the rules?&quot; Maxine smiled to the others at the table, before dealing the cards.<br />
<br />
Millie and Robyn nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we wager?&quot; Roger asked nervously, &quot;as I doubt we'll be using money for bets anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They could be friendly,&quot; Maxine offered, &quot;we don't have to bet anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, suguh,&quot; Robyn protested, &quot;bets make it interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what do we have to bet?&quot; Millie asked, &quot;all the money I had was in my wallet... which I don't need or want anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maxine thought for a moment, &quot;how about losers please the winner of each hand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger gulped.</p>
