<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Wake up Zach”<br />
<br />
My head hurt. What was Rod doing in my room? Then I remembered: Sarah was now Rod and I was Sarah. And I was in Rod’s bed. <br />
“What time is it?”<br />
<br />
“7.30. But I want to get over to Mum’s to pick up the rest of my stuff” <br />
<br />
I struggled to sit up. My head pounded. I realized I was only clad in Sarah’s strapless bra and a G-string. “I had a few too many drinks”<br />
<br />
“You think?” I got the impression I was not going to get any sympathy from Sarah this morning.<br />
<br />
I staggered into the en suite, knelt down in front of the toilet and emptied the contents of my stomach into the bowl. After some dry retches I actually felt better. I realized Sarah was behind me watching. I must have been quite a site, worshipping a toilet in a black G-string. “When you are finished you might want to remove the tampon. Pull on the string. Place it in this bag, not in the toilet. I would also advise drinking lots of water” He shut the door behind me.<br />
<br />
It took about 10 minutes for me to rinse the vomit taste out of my mouth, clean the toilet and with the aid of a ceiling fan get the stink out of the room. Eventually I sat on the toilet the correct way and located the tampon string. It was harder to get out than I expected and quite an unpleasant feeling. It was soaked with blood, a reminder that I was likely stuck in this body for a few more hours yet.<br />
<br />
When I re-entered the bedroom I noticed that Sarah had left the silk dressing gown on the bed. I put it on and went to find Sarah. He was in the kitchen. Eating a bowl of cereal. Biddy greeted me by jumping on my legs, demanding a scratch. “Feeling better” Sarah asked. I nodded, but winced as that that caused pain “Best to have just a piece of toast for breakfast, let your stomach settle. I’m off for a run”<br />
<br />
I took my time to nibble on a piece of toast and drank as much water as I could handle. I then went to the guest bedroom and collected some sensible panties and a normal bra. I felt dirty and needed a shower. As I entered the bathroom I couldn’t help bit look in the mirror. My hair was a total tangle and I still had remnants of make-up on my face. I followed the directions Sarah had given me a week ago to remove the remaining makeup, jumped under the shower and rinsed my hair.<br />
<br />
I was clean and almost feeling human again as I exited the bathroom, to find Sarah coming through the front room after his run. He came and selected some white shorts, a pink top and sandals that I should wear to ‘Mums’ and went back to Rod’s room to shower himself.<br />
<br />
I was still feeling seedy as we pulled into the McKenzie’s driveway in Rod’s car. We were greeted at the door by Eileen who gave me a big hug and invited us into the kitchen for a ‘Cuppa’. There we were joined by ‘Dad’ and Jenna. Jenna was keen to find out all she could about Biddy, saying how lucky I was to have a dog. Evidently as kids they had not been allowed a pet dog. Jenna thought that was child abuse. <br />
<br />
When we were finished ‘Dad’ took ‘Rod’ out to show him what he was making in the shed. Jenna went with them. I noticed she was flirting with ‘Rod’ (really Sarah). When they were out of earshot ‘Mum’ said “I am really worried about Jenna, one minute she is all nice and sweet, the next she is raving and swearing. She has her court case on Wednesday, I do hope she behaves or they might have to hospitalize her” I reminded myself to ask Sarah about the ‘court case’ later. “Let’s go and see what else you want from your room. I had your father put some old suitcases in there yesterday”<br />
<br />
As we approached Sarah’s room I noticed it now had a lock on the door, ‘Mum’ had a key. Inside everything seemed intact, just as I had left it on Tuesday morning. ‘Mum’ left me to pack in peace. I filled one of the suitcases that was on the floor with various items of clothes, taking my time in the hope that the real Sarah would come and select the items he actually wanted. <br />
<br />
Eventually he turned up and started going through the cupboards. In no time all the suitcases and boxes in the room were filled. I helped Sarah take them out to Rod’s car. We came back and collected some additional items from the bathroom. Sarah asked me to take two of the largest teddy bears from her room to the car. Evidently they were her favorites. I thought we might be done but Sarah told me to ask ‘Mum’ for a key to a locked hallway cupboard. I did so and was surprised when he removed another box of shoes and another armful of hanging dresses. He said “A lady can never have too many shoes”<br />
<br />
We took these last items out to the vehicle and somehow fitted them in. As we re-entered the house we could hear a bit of commotion from the kitchen. Jenna and her father were having an animated conversation. We entered the kitchen just in time to see Jenna throw a banana at ‘Dad’ screaming at him “It’s not fair” It was certainly strange to see and attractive 25 year old woman chucking a tantrum like a three year old. ‘Mum’ restrained her in a cuddle until Jenna started sobbing. <br />
<br />
Eventually ‘Mum’ looked at me and asked “Sarah, do you think it would be possible to bring Biddy around to meet Jenna? Maybe tomorrow?” <br />
<br />
“Sure Mum, maybe later tomorrow, I have to work at the motor show until 3” <br />
<br />
“Perhaps you could all come around and stay for dinner”<br />
<br />
I looked at Sarah, he nodded “Ok Mum we’ll all come around for dinner tomorrow night. How about we get here at about 5?”<br />
Dad accompanied us to the door, gave me a hug and said “See you tomorrow Sweetheart”<br />
……..<br />
On the way home I asked Sarah about the “Court date”. Evidently Jenna was charged by the police with breaking into a neighbors and stealing clothing. The lawyers were defending her on the grounds of temporary insanity and were hoping she would get off with a good behavior bond<br />
<br />
By the time we had emptied the cars contents into the guest bedroom it was mid-day. Sarah asked “Is your period finished?” I visited the toilet, looked at the pad I had put in this morning and saw the smallest of spots. I replaced it. I exited and reported what I had seen to Sarah. “Let’s have lunch and give it a couple more hours. Maybe we can try swapping at 4.”<br />
“I think that’s a good idea. I’m starting to get hungry”<br />
……….<br />
We had finished lunch and cleaned the dishes. I had put a load of washing through Rod’s machine that was now hanging on the outside line. We had both gone to the supermarket and restocked the pantry. It was now 2.15 pm. “It’s hard to wait” I said to Sarah “We need to occupy ourselves”. We didn’t want to try the medallion prematurely. If my period had not completely finished I could delay the swap back for 12 hours. I had calculated we should be able to swap at 3 but had added another hour just to be safe.<br />
<br />
He nodded “It is hard to wait“. He looked at me. “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” <br />
<br />
The idea of swapping sexes was a turn-on and going through my mind was the thought that one last experience of sex as a female couldn’t do any harm. I didn’t want to push Sarah, currently in the male ‘Rod’ form, as she was engaged to the real Rod, my best mate. But Rod was actually in my original ‘Zach’ body, away on a romantic weekend with my girlfriend Amanda. We had already had sex together multiple times. What harm could we do? Certainly the Sarah body I occupied craved Rod’s body. “I’m going to have a rest, join me if you like”<br />
I went to the master bedroom took off my shorts and top and slipped into the newly made bed. I listened and could hear Sarah locking the front door then putting Biddy out the back. I lay still with my back to the door and heard Sarah enter the bedroom and slip into bed beside me. Very soon I felt a naked penis nudging my rear and felt hands unclasping my bra. <br />
<br />
We occupied each other very well for the next hour. During my third orgasm the thought crossed my mind that I might actually miss this once I was male again. Sarah who had shown remarkable restraint finally succumbed and ejaculated into my vagina. Then promptly fell asleep. I lay there feeling snug, enveloped in his arms but became a bit alarmed when I realised we had not used any protection. I didn’t know a great deal about the female menstrual cycle but thought that the fertile period started about a week after the period finished. I hoped I was correct.<br />
After a time I snuck out of bed without disturbing Sarah and went to the toilet. There had been no blood on my pad in the discarded panties so I was very confident the period had finished. It was 3.45 so I decided to have one last shower as a female, washing the semen from around my pussy.<br />
I redressed in the clothes I had worn earlier and since it was now 4, woke Sarah saying “It’s time”. He got out of bed, pulled on some boxer shorts, collected the medallion from it’s hiding place and placed it on the bed.<br />
“You go first. Try the shirt I was wearing this morning” <br />
I removed the engagement ring from my hand and picked up the shirt Sarah had discarded before our last bout of lovemaking. I shook the shirt to make sure no other clothing had attached itself. A stray bra had got me unstuck last time - all was clear. With the other hand I picked up the medallion, then bought my hands together. I felt a shock.<br />
I carefully put both items down and we walked to the bathroom so I could watch in the larger mirror. By the time I got there I could already see my hair was shorter. I watched as the changes continued. They did not regress! I quickly pulled off the pink top and removed the bra. I watched as my breasts shrank and I grew taller. I slipped off the shorts and panties and watched with glee as I started to grow a penis and balls albeit child sized. I was a man again! I continued watching as my face started to change. <br />
Sarah said “Thank god it’s working. My turn now” She went to the bedroom and fetched the medallion then went to the guest bedroom and came back with the bra I had worn while she did my hair and makeup last night. “I don’t want your hangover and I don’t mind having a period for a few hours in order to get my hair done” she grinned. I watched as she held the two items together. We watched as my changes continued and Sarah’s started. <br />
I was now more male than female. Sarah’s hair grew first, long dark and wavy, looking a bit incongruous with Rod’s face. He started to shrink and lose facial and body hair. His waist narrowed and muscles shrank. His features grew softer. He dropped his boxers and we watched as his penis contracted and breasts started to grow. By now my changes had stopped and I was now fully Rod. Speaking of which I was at full attention as Sarah regained her true form. I made no move to put on clothes as her changes finished. Her hair was immaculate and I knew she was freshly showered. I was puzzled as to why her fingers and toes had polished nails but she was not made-up. When everything was complete I looked at her and said “Let’s go back to bed”<br />
We were both invigorated by our changes and I was careful to make sure she orgasmed 3 times before I erupted into her. Again we fell asleep, this time with my arms around her.<br />
………..<br />
Biddy woke us wanting to be fed at 6. I fed him while Sarah had a shower. I noticed she had kept her hair dry when she got out, and walked up to me in the kitchen wrapped in a towel. She had brushed it neat again but it still had luscious waves. She said “How about we go out for dinner” and went to the guest bedroom to find something to wear. I took the opportunity to shower myself.<br />
I put on a suit and tie of Rod’s. When I returned to the lounge Sarah was in the bathroom and called out that I should try and book a table for two at ‘La Belles’ I knew this was the restaurant where Rod had proposed to her only a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
She emerged from the bathroom all made-up and looking gorgeous in a little black dress. The engagement ring sparkled on her finger. I made sure I had some money and ushered her to Rod’s car. <br />
<br />
We had a lovely meal, starting with an oyster entrée. I enjoyed an eye fillet while Sarah had a Snapper dish. We finished with a coffee. Instead of going straight home Sarah said she felt like a walk down the main street. <br />
<br />
We strolled down the street, hand in hand, window shopping. Sarah pointed out dresses she liked in the boutiques we passed and admired the window displays at the jeweller&#39;s. We stopped at an ice-cream shop and picked up a cone each. When I was finished she told me to bend down so she could lick some ice-cream off my chin. I did as I was told. The lick turned into a kiss. The kiss lingered until someone in a passing car suggested we should “Get a room’.<br />
<br />
We made our way back to the car and drove home. I should say Rod’s but it was starting to feel like home to me. Once there we turned on the TV to a music video show and cuddled up on the couch. We were soon kissing again and before long Sarah was holding my hand and pulling me back to the master bedroom……. I didn’t recognize the lingerie she was wearing under her dress…….</p>
