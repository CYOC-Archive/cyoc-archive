<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Note: got my stories crossed up. His name is Dan, not Jeff.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Standing inside the dark trailer as it bumps along the road to an unknown destination, Dan was trapped. He attempted to kick out with his hind legs in panic. But the rope around his legs, the large horse, the trailer wall, and the donkey in front of him prevented him from being able to do so. He was trapped well and good. He could only stand there braying his dismay. It almost felt to him like being trapped in a coffin. Unable to use his arms in such close confines. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. I don&#39;t even HAVE arms anymore&quot; Dan thought sadly. The trailer continued bumping along taking Dan to his doom. He tried calming himself. There wasn&#39;t anything he could do anyhow. He tried taking his mind off of his situation. There wasn&#39;t much to look at. Mostly the back rump of another donkey. His sharp sense of smell with a continual whiff of this donkey&#39;s dirty ass. He could only stare, as its tail slowly drifted back and forth.  <br />
<br />
Occasionally, with each bump and turn, he would be thrown forward a little bit. His own disgusting nostrils would contact that dirty old donkey&#39;s rear end. At one point, its tail lifted up and to the side. It kinda got caught up on the harness the horse was still wearing to his right. Now Dan&#39;s majority view was that donkey&#39;s ass AND his huge black wobbly balls! They would swing and jiggle with each bounce. They were large and disgusting. With growing dread, Dan came to realize HE he had those exact same large black balls that wobble and jiggle with each bounce in between his own two back legs. And his own Large Black Balls would be similarly exposed to any who&#39;s eyes wandered over to him. He couldn&#39;t ever wear clothes again to hide his modesty. <br />
<br />
Another big bounce and turning curve. He was shoved forward, his nose smacking up against that donkey&#39;s Large Black Balls! Dan&#39;s head was lowered in shame and defeat with that bouncing curving turn. His snout buried itself between that natural-born donkey&#39;s back legs! <br />
<br />
Dan felt his own balls bounce and wobble. He felt his growing and stiffening penis swing around. He got a really strong whiff of that donkey&#39;s musky sex and ass. A smell his own body is similarly putting forth and always will. Just a dirty old fat donkey. Eerrgghh Hhhaaww.<br />
<br />
He quickly pulled his head back and snout away from that damned animal. An animal whose species is now his! That animal&#39;s naturally dull mind ignored all of this. A dull mind, it might be noted, that would have a better grasp on spoken English than Dan&#39;s human mind ever would.<br />
<br />
His sharp hearing then picked up the sound of water spraying. He thought at first that the trailer sprang some kinda leak somewhere. But then, the intense sharp smell of ammonia assaulted his sensitive nose! It was piss! Someone was pissing. <br />
<br />
Wait. &quot;Someone?&quot; He thought the word &quot;someone,&quot; as if these two lowly animals were his equal! He was reminded of just how lowly he now is. Not able to ever sit in the cabin of this truck. Nor ever even the inside of a car. He wasn&#39;t even worthy of the most basic of clothing, save for a 4-set of hard, cold, iron horseshoes that would be nailed into place on the bottoms of his cold, hard, immobile hooves. <br />
<br />
He would soon enough come to realize that these two animals he is currently sharing a horse trailer with, are not his equal. He would soon come to realize they are his SUPERIORS instead! He wouldn&#39;t even be worthy to be in the presence of the horse he was currently tied to, except during his training and breaking. He would soon learn the order of things: This horse would always eat first. Followed by a bunch of bulls. Then followed by the alpha male donkey in front of him. Dan would be one of the last few farm animals to be allowed to eat. He would be always given whatever left over hay all those other animals&#39; dirty mouths have touched before him. Never be given the choicest parts of even simple disgusting hay. But all of this is neither here nor there. In the present time, he is smelling the horrendous smell of some animal&#39;s piss!<br />
<br />
He discovered the donkey in front of him was the one pissing! And by the sound of it, it was gallons of donkey urine, spraying out like a firehouse. His own donkey dick would now always do the same thing. It would be a firehose. <br />
<br />
He discovered that piss was moving towards him. With horror, he tried backing up. But it was sweeping closer to him and he couldn&#39;t go anywhere. He tried clopping his front hooves further apart, but it was also spreading out. Eventually, he was forced to just stand in it. Luckily, he couldn&#39;t feel it. His arms were just legs anyway, and his hands were hooves that would only be used to stand on and for nothing else. <br />
<br />
Then manure came flying out of that donkey&#39;s ass. Two, then three, then four piles! They plopped directly in front of him into the floor of the trailer! Then he felt his own tail lift (which he forgot he even had until now,) and felt manure similarly exit his own ass! He had no control over his own bowels! It just happened! <br />
<br />
Then the manure smell of a farm suddenly grew. Because it was an enclosed space, it was intense! Dan tried holding his breath, but couldn&#39;t. He was forced to breath in the dirty acrid air through his sensitive sharp-smelling nose! <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the truck began to slow. Then it made a turn. Instinctively trying to keep his balance, his left hoof stamped directly in the middle of that donkey&#39;s manure, at the same time his back hoof stamped into his own pile of donkey manure!  His hooves have officially been christened! They&#39;ll forever be caked in mud and manure now. They&#39;ll never be as clean as they first were, except for the mercy of his owners to clean them. And even then, they will never be sanitized. Not that they would need to be. He will be forced to drop his head and shove his face to the ground in order to eat like the common donkey he is. <br />
<br />
Realizing more of his fate, Dan became even more depressed. His witch of a sister put him at the same lowly level as a bunch of farm animals! He contemplated his revenge. A revenge that would be utterly impossible to exact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrgghh hhhhaaww,&quot; came the sound of the alpha donkey at random. The sound that IMMEDIATELY irritated and humiliated him and always will every single time he hears it! Because he knew that was the same sound he could only make himself. &quot;Eerrgghh Hhhaaww&quot;. Hearing that sound would be the worst part of his life. Worse than eating plain old hay. About as bad as not having hands and fingers. That sharp, noisy obnoxious &quot;eeerrggh hhhhaawww!&quot; <br />
<br />
He was suddenly jealous of the horse next to him. That horse would be neighing and winnying. Somehow, a much more respectable noise with a wider range of vocalization. Imagine! Actually being JEALOUS of a HORSE!  EERRRGGHH HHHHAAAWWW<br />
<br />
Wanting to burst out into tears, he also wanted nothing more than to climb under a rock and just die. But he could do neither. Slowing down again, and another turn. Then a little speed up, followed closely by another big turn and slow down. Followed by a stop! He was thrown and jostled around, bringing him out of his depressed state of mind temporarily. He felt his big penis and Large Black Balls swing and jiggle and wobble all over the place. His tail was swinging around. And his view of the donkey&#39;s big black balls swinging and wobbling around registered the exact same movements from his own nether regions. His balls were moving in time with that donkeys balls. And no doubt, with that horse&#39;s. Just seeing those balls before him marked him with such intense dread. They were so big and so floppy. They were so dark and velvetty. They were the exact same balls he was in possession of! Seeing those, he might as well be seeing his own! <br />
<br />
He also felt dread and nervousness, because he thought they had finally arrived at his new home. He heard the truck doors open and slam. Then the sound of boot-clad human footsteps on gravel. A sound he would dearly miss and make him extremely nostalgic! One set was walking away, and the other walking closer, then further away. He heard them go in opposite directions. One stopped before the other. Then he heard a loud &quot;click&quot;, then smelt the burning odor of gas. It smelled horrendous to his sharp donkey sense of smell. He could almost not breathe at all.<br />
<br />
The horse neighed, and the donkey brayed. &quot;eerrgghh Hhhaaww eerrgghh hhhaaww EEERRGGHH hhaaww eeerrggghh hhhaawww&quot; went his own voice and that of the other donkey&#39;s together. <br />
<br />
One was braying in irritation with no thought behind it, and the other with human thoughts and the desire to speak the words he was attempting to speak. Both sounded exactly the same. &quot;Eerrgghh Hhhaaww eeerrrgghh hhhaawwww!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dan wanted to get the man&#39;s attention. But with the other donkey also braying, his went ignored as if it was just another braying of a jackass. Which it was. Just two lowly jackasses braying inside a horse trailer to an indifferent world. Lost in the wind. <br />
<br />
Then the men got back into the truck, and they continued on their journey.</p>
