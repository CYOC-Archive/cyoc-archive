<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning JJ woke up in his bed feeling a little bit odd. Taking off his shirt he sees that he has another set of arms coming out of his sides just below his armpits. He was in shock because he couldn’t think of any act that would have multiple arms. Jack walked into his sons room seeing the four armed 15 year old. Jack sat on james’ bed comforting his son Jack explained that this change meant that he would be a juggler this month. He would learn how to keep his extra arms hidden from normal people. Jack then made a few calls then there was a knock at their door. The head juggler of the circus Jase Jug. Jase walked into JJ’s room Jase looked at the boy he handed him a pile of clothes. JJ recognized these as the shirts that all the jugglers wore during their shows. They were a bunch of colorful vest that had enough room to fit both sets of arms in. Buttoning up his vest JJ went to the kitchen and ate breakfast he was struggling however because he was trying to use his other arms as well. Finishing up JJ walked outside and met up with LoLo and Milo who thought his new arms were super cool. Arriving at the practice ring they began practice. Since it was Saturday there were longer practices and rehearsal that were held since the kids didn’t have school. For the first time JJ actually got to participate in. JJ walked over to Jace the juggler who would be the boy’s teacher. Jace started off his lesson by revealing his second set of arms as well  they were hidden in his side all had to was flex his second set of pecks and the arms appeared. Jace told JJ to try using his second arms to mimic what he did with his top set of arms. After an hour or so JJ had a good amount of individual control over his four arms. The next few days followed with with Jace starting JJ off with tossing 1 ball back, forth and between this four arms. After a week of intense practice in the ring and at home. JJ was juggling 3 balls all around his four arms. Unaware to him, the reason JJ’s training was moving so fast was because he was the ringleader’s son. It’s literally in his genetics, circus acts and routines are apart of him. He has the ability to pick them up pretty quick. <br />
<br />
So after a week of training JJ would make his first appearance as a part of the jugglers at the Bazar Jubilee. Jace arrived at JJ’s trailer a few hours before the show to drop off his costume. It was another colorful vest only this one was shinier. Along with a pair of puffy loose white pants. And some simple brown shoes. JJ went into his room and put on the new pants and shoes. Taking his shirt off he flexed his chest as his extra arms appeared. He buttoned up his vest and made his way to the circus with his dad. Arriving Jace brought JJ over to the makeup chair as he grabbed some hair gel and slicked up his hair but only the bottom half making him look a little sillier with the top half of his hair hanging down. The jugglers also put some red circles on their checks.  Jace handed JJ his props as he would be juggling bowling pins back and forth with him. Walking over to his friends LoLo giggled at JJ’s appearance. JJ then reached up with his bottom right arm and honked his nose. Pretty soon it was JJ’s turn running out into the ring he felt the roar of the crowd as JJ was introduced to the crowd. Some members of the crowd remembering him from the previous weeks show. He started to juggle balls with all four of his arms. Jace was doing the same as the two of the started to toss the balls back and forth to each other. Eventually trading out the balls for bowling pins. The pins were flying back and forth through the air. Finally catching the last pins one in each arm JJ finished and loses for the audience and heard their cheers. JJ continued to perform as a juggler for the next three weeks. Later in to the month JJ’s dad showed that he had the ability to make juggling arms appear from his sides as well. As JJ finished up his final show he gave Jace a hug for helping him with helping him out this whole month. Returning back to his trailer he felt is extra arms start to tingle he looked down as the started to shrink away with out him doing anything. He looked at his dad as he said that it looked like his time as a juggler was over. He explained that his arms will be back. Next year after you have spent time with all of the acts you will get all of the changes back to become a real ringleader. Understanding JJ went back into his bed room took off his costume and hung it up. He fell into his bed wondering what circus journey he would start down tomorrow.</p>
