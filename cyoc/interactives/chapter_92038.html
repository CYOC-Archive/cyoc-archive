<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Right so I can take anything&quot; Lana tells herself as she picks up the rule book and skims through the pages, after a long pause Lana begins to laugh.<br />
<br />
Luke looks both worried and confused as he asks &quot;What are you laughing about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The rule book basically says that I can take anything from the losers current situation, so that means that I can even switch one thing which will force other changes to happen to make the new situation work&quot;, She explains grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait please don&#39;t do anything drastic I didn&#39;t do anything to you, it was Jessica that took your education have it out on her not me!&quot; Luke cries.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I don&#39;t remember playing this before, if I had this whole situation would have been different&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, so you don&#39;t remember that Jessica beat you and took your education?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica giggles as she get up and sits next to Luke, she whispers, &quot;I made it so that she would forget once I took the necklace&#39;s off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke looks at her and scowls, then whispers back, &quot;that&#39;s not very nice Jess, especially seen as she&#39;s probably going to do something drastic to me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Game, I want to switch Luke and my physical situations. So Luke will become the mother of the family and I will become the son.&quot; Lana says abruptly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Luke and Jessica say in unison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh also only Luke and I will remember what I chose to take.&quot;, Lana adds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! That&#39;s not...&quot; Jessica begins before she collapses back on the sofa and falls into a deep sleep, without finishing what she was about to say.<br />
<br />
Lana begins to shift, her body twists and shrinks though her body proportions shift in a different way as it did with Jessica. Her height is the first thing to change, sudden chunks of her height disappears as she gets shorter and shorter, then settles at Luke&#39;s height. She looks pretty stupid at this point, all of her other proportions are the same as they were, but now she looks like she&#39;s been in a crusher. Along with the height changes, her whole body shrinks to that of an average 13 year old boy.<br />
Her weight is the next to go, because she is slim already it Is swiftly over. The weight drips off like sweat, until she looks to be a similar weight to Luke. Her breasts go along with her weight, shrivelling until her chest is flat. Her bum does the same.<br />
Her hair shrinks back into her head, until her hairstyle becomes a short boys cut, her auburn hair darkens and dulls into a dark brown like Luke&#39;s hair. All that changes with her face is the faint wrinkles disappear like an eraser rubbing out lines on a piece of paper. Her cheek puff out, making her young looking face look even younger.<br />
What happened next was hidden from view, but they both knew what was happening, her vagina as pushing out into a small ball sack and her clitoris pushed out further into the size of a cocktail sausage, &quot;Well that feels strange.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once the transformation is over, he looks at Luke with his oversized dress falling off his shoulders, &quot;hmm, looks like we&#39;ll have to switch clothes after this.&quot; A sudden pain pushes up Luke&#39;s body, &quot;looks like it&#39;s your turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke&#39;s changes are different from he mums, the first thing to change is his legs. Pins and needles shoot up his leg and stop at his hip, they then go numb as he sits their watching them grow and lengthen to longer than his upper body. <br />
<br />
The little amount of hair that he had on his legs recede back into his skins, this change continues throughout his body, creating a smooth soft surface that is now his skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that looks strange&quot; Lana says, fixated on the changes Luke is going through, &quot;I have to admit those legs look twice as good as mine did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke scowls, &quot;Shut up, I&#39;m annoyed that you did this to me, I never did anything to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look I won the game so I get what I want, whether you like it or not is irrelevant&quot; he replied, &quot;Just admit you&#39;re curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes but isn&#39;t anyone curious about what it would be like to be the opposite sex.&quot; he answers, as he did his hips cracked as they stretched out into wide, child bearing hips and with a ripping sound his trousers that now looked like shorts, ripped slightly then fell down revealing his balled privates. Then with a thwack Luke doubled over where he sat, yelling out in pain. He knew what was happening, his already small penis pulled inwards to form a clitoris and his balls followed with a popping sound as they went inwards, the remaining skin formed his vagina. &quot;What the hell was that?!&quot; Luke yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well by the looks of it, you&#39;ve now got women&#39;s parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that! I mean why did it hurt for me and not you?&quot;, Luke replied moving his legs open and closed trying to get use of the empty space in-between his or should I say her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well mine were going out and yours were going in, its obvious its going to hurt for you&quot; Lana says with a smile, as he continues to watch as Luke&#39;s upper body begins to stretch upwards. Her chest grows to the size of an adult woman&#39;s, although he waist stays the same. Her nipples grow in size and move forward as her breasts begin to develop and grow like two water balloons attached to her chest, until they grew to about a C-cup as they stopped growing the flopped down to a natural position on her chest. &quot;Well that was interesting&quot; Luke says moving his stretching arms to towards his newly developed breasts.<br />
<br />
While Luke fondles her breasts, &quot;hmm I though you&#39;d have bigger breasts than that, I guess that&#39;s because you took after your farther or should I say husband&quot; Lana suggests.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay that just sounds like incest, but I don&#39;t think the game would make me and dad relatives&quot;, Luke answers.<br />
<br />
Her face grows and ages in the reverse of how it had done when Jessica took his age. Though instead of changing into a masculine face, it slims and smooth&#39;s into a to become a feminine version of her old face. as the changes to head and face end, an itching sensation starts all over his scalp, his hair lengthens and grows down and then subsides when it reaches the top of his buttock. While her hair stops growing, her buttock puffs out into a nicely rounded ass. <br />
<br />
As his transformation completes it becomes hard not to notice the fact that her clothes that had once fit, now look like a tube top and well his trousers fell of earlier so, just the top. She slides the top over her head while she tells Lana, &quot;Okay lets switch clothes then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea, especially seen as I thought of it&quot; he replies with a wink as he does has his new mother says. Once he has everything off, he hands it to Luke and says, &quot;I don&#39;t think the bra will fit but the rest of it should.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke takes the clothes from Lana, and picks out the bra placing it onto her breasts, &quot;Nope it seems to fit, looks like the game changes the size of the clothes to fit me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm you forgot to give me some of you womanly skills, I don&#39;t know how to put this on.&quot; Luke says, awkwardly holding the cups of the bra on his breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I did say &#39;physical situation&#39; not &#39;physical and mental situation&#39;, what did you expect but don&#39;t expect me to tell you what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Argh so I&#39;m gonna have to learn everything, boring.&quot; Luke moans, as she slides her hands through the straps and over her shoulders, straining to hook the back together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually that reminds me, we need to think of our new names, I think mine will be Lance, how about you?&quot;, Lance says as he pulls his trousers up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll go with Lucy, that&#39;s about the only name I can think of that&#39;s female for Luke&quot;, Lucy says with a smile. She bends down to pick up her dress after putting on her panties, &quot;looks like the dress has changed, it looks a bit smaller than it was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm that&#39;s strange, it should be bigger than smaller, seen as you seem to be taller than I was.&quot; Lance ponders.<br />
<br />
Noticing the new zip on the front of the dress, Lucy pulls down the zip and wraps the open dress around her, pulling the two sides of the zip together. As she does so, the fabric stretches and the her breast squish together until the two sides of the zip connect, swiftly she pulls the zip up as far as it will go, which is in about the centre of the her cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s awkward.&quot; Lance sniggers.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not funny, why did the game make this dress so &#39;sexy&#39;&quot;, Lucy asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, I guess that&#39;s how it&#39;d be if you were the mum of the house, I&#39;d check the rest of your clothes to see.&quot; Lance replies as he walks towards the stairs. While he does so the front door opens. He turns around to look at Lucy, &quot;looks like your hubby is home.&quot;</p>
