<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy sighed and walked back into the shop as it buzzed with the sound of clanking metal. The murmur of soft, gruff voices echoed from further inside. Troy turned a corner, entering a pseudo-lobby and found a front desk with a bell and a buzzer. The bell was labeled ‘Bubba’. Troy rang it twice and waited.<br />
<br />
Heavy footsteps came around the corner, and Troy was confronted with an enormous man. He was taller, much taller, than Troy by at least a foot. His weathered face bore a scratchy brown beard that hung all the way to his mid-gut. The man’s massive frame was a heavy, well-built machine of fat and muscle. Hair peaked out of the neck of his collared shirt, which strained to contain his massive pecs and huge gut. His exposed arms were a thick forest of hair and bulging muscles that ran uniformly up his sleeves. More than anything else, the smell of sweat and grease radiated off of his person into Troy’s nose.<br />
<br />
“Can I help you,” The massive man’s voice came out in a slow, smooth growl as he spoke to Troy in hushed tones.<br />
<br />
Troy was more than a little intimidated; The man oozed the kind of confidence and command that made him want to be polite and proper. It was an aura that seemed to fill the sweltering room. Troy pulled at the neck of his shirt to air himself out.<br />
<br />
“Uh, y-yes sir. Sam sent me to talk to you,” Troy stuttered, mumbling over himself immediately. “I have some cars that I wanted you to appraise. I’m not sure how valuable they all are, but if you could take a look?”<br />
<br />
The man stared at him, gray eyes suddenly dark. Troy lowered his gaze, avoiding eye contact with the mountain of a man before him. He immediately humbled himself and breathed slow to maintain composure. The man’s stink was almost overpowering.<br />
<br />
“Sam sent ya,” The man smiled, his face widening with an infectious and inviting grin. He gazed at Troy for a moment, looking him over from top to bottom. This quick inspection made the man smile more. &quot;Ohh ya, I can take a look at whater&#39; you got&quot;<br />
<br />
“Oh, thanks a lot sir!” Troy was flooded with relief. He needed to get to these cars off his hands, he didn&#39;t even care if he made much off of them. He didn’t care if he had to pay instead! “My grandpa passed, and he has all of these old cars just piled in his back lot. I don’t even care what it takes, but I need them cleared off the lot fast!” <br />
<br />
It was a lie, but a good one. His own grandfather had an old country home where he just left old cars out to rot in his backyard. He now remembered his parents having a hell of a time trying to dispose of them when he’d passed.<br />
<br />
“Oh?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah… I think Sam kinda got the wrong impression…” Troy shrugged. “My mom had to deal with the same thing when her dad passed. They ended up burning them all and getting in trouble.”<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s not going to be a problem anymore; I promise that ta yuh,” The man said solemnly. “And I am sorry fer yer loss, but before I take a look at yur car I just have to fill out some paperwork. You understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy nodded, &quot;Absolutely sir, if you need anything, ask away!&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy felt so docile. He could trust this man with anything. He wanted to make this man happy.<br />
<br />
The man pulled out a clipboard which he had close to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Troy.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Cute name.” The man began giggling, an involuntary reflex causing his whole body to jiggle. He licked his lips, giving Troy a wink that reminded Troy strongly of Sam. &quot;Okay, Troy. I hope you&#39;ll be a regular. My name is Bubba, but the guys around here call me Sir… or Daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy&#39;s cock hardened involuntarily. He could feel himself pitching a tent in his khaki pants, and he desperately wanted to hide it. Shifting uncomfortably, he looked up at the big man, trying to remember what he’d asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Daddy, uh, I mean, Sir! I mean Bubba!&quot; Troy babbled, completely flustered.<br />
<br />
Bubba wrote down something on his clipboard, a quick note.<br />
<br />
Troy suddenly felt very hot, the garage was absolutely stifling. Oil, grease, sweat, and sex continued to be all he smelled. His mind was racing with strange thoughts of driving a stick shift, which didn’t make sense, and of how driving semis worked. He played with his long-sleeve shirt, the hair on his arms feeling increasing itchy. The young man didn’t notice the edge of his sleeves begin to rise, revealing hairier arms. <br />
<br />
The itchy sensation spread from his arms all across his body. Chest hairs began to poke from the top of his shirt as the sleeves disappeared, becoming straps. The color faded and the texture of the fabric shifted into a ribbed white wifebeater. Troy desperately wanted to scratch his arms and chest, to relieve the urge, but for some reason his didn’t want to make a bad impression on Daddy. <br />
<br />
Bubba leaned in closer to Troy, closing the distance between them. &quot;You work out much?&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy could smell Bubba more intensely and inhaled deeply, reveling in the stench of a working man. &quot;No Daddy, not often&quot;<br />
<br />
“I can tell. Gettin’ yerself a roadbelly there, son,” Bubba said, not unkindly, and wrote down another note.<br />
<br />
Troy burped, tasting the two Big Mac meals he’d eaten early. Which was strange, because he could have sworn he’d just had a ham sandwich for lunch. His stomach gurgled and he felt strangely full. He swallowed thickly and placed a hand on his softening and swelling stomach. His muscles flexed, growing toned, and then the definition was washed away by a thick layer of chub. <br />
<br />
He rubbed his growing gut, making it jiggle as he grew out in size. Muscle and fat grew on his body, filling out Troy&#39;s proportions. Troy wobbled off-balance as his burgeoning belly pulled his wife beater upwards, exposing six inches of furry gut and exposed his belly button to the hot air of the garage. Angry red stretchmarks zig zagged across his gut. His ass ballooned as well, pushing against his khakis as the material shifted into denim; A thick leather belt with a shiny belt buckle weaving itself through the loops and tightening itself to snugness. Chub sagged over it into a proper muffin top. His jeans strained and sagged too as his ass widened, unable to contain it properly, his hairy crack peeking out from the top. The heat was unbearable, sweat trickling down his hairy armpits and down his gut.<br />
<br />
Troy groaned, trying to tug up his too-small jeans over his squishy ass and pull his too-short wife beater over his gut. Something was wrong, he… he was skinny and he… shouldn’t be hairy, right? It was so hot, too hot to think.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, big guy? Ya belly aching? Lemme give ya a good rub.” Bubba leered at Troy and licked his lips.<br />
<br />
Bubba placed his hand on Troy&#39;s exposed stomach, reaching into Troy&#39;s shirt, scratching at the growing hair underneath. Troy groaned in relief as the man scritched. He smacked his lips, memories of eating fast food for the last five months and gaining damn near a hundred pounds settling in as Bubba gently rubbed his furry gut. Any conflicting thoughts soothed away. Tory belched again, the angry stretch marks marring his furry belly fading and the overfull feeling in his stomach receding. <br />
<br />
The massive man reached further and further up Troy&#39;s wife beater, pulling it up as he went. His hairy belly, released from its cloth prison, flopped over his belt, concealing the buckle. Soon Troy’s shirt came to a rest at the top of his gut, and the man’s hands began to tweak and tug at Troy’s nipples. Little electric sparks of pleasure shot from his sensitive and swelling nips down to his groin and up into his head, making Troy gasp. Bubba kept squeezing and pinching, and Troy’s nips swelled as thick as pencil erasers. His pecs swelled and wobbled under Bubba’s attentions before sagging to rest perkily on the top of his belly, a pair of hairy moobs. <br />
<br />
Troy groaned as the big man worked his sensitive nipples. He was thankful his daddy was taking care of him. He came here often just to hang out. He liked seeing the big guys work in the back, seeing them lean too far down, exposing their ass to everyone behind them. He liked watching them sweat from working hard underneath big trucks in need of repairs. He liked the smell of the place as he leaned in closer Bubba.<br />
<br />
Bubba looked him over before his eyes centered on the top of Troy’s head. His meaty hand fell on top of it and began rubbing him. The big bear rubbed the whorl of hair at the back of his head, a bald spot forming and widening. Tory’s hairline began to recede under the bears gentle rubs and the cub moaned, not sure what was going on. He leaned into the rub, feeling the big, meaty hand rub less and less hair and more smooth, bald pate. Soon he was left with a completely bald head with a horseshoe of hair that seemed to buzz itself short.<br />
<br />
The big bear leaned into Troy&#39;s ear, his voice a whisper,&quot;Come into the back, you hot little trucker cub. I wanna give you a test ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy dared not refuse. Bubba pushed his face into Troy&#39;s, kissing him with his rough and chapped lips. Bubba&#39;s beard brushed against Troy&#39;s face, bristling his smooth and unblemished skin. As Bubba moved away, he left Troy with his own growing beard. It started patchy but soon became fuller with each passing second. It grew off his face, hanging down much the same way Bubba&#39;s did, coming to rest on his gut.<br />
<br />
They left the reception area and went towards Bubba&#39;s office, passing by the other workers of the shop. All of them were big and hairy, sweat glistening on the fur that peaked out of their jumpsuits. Troy saw them staring at him as he passed. They smiled and gawked at him some wolf whistling, making him blush. Troy thought he caught a brief glimpse of two of the big men fondling each other behind a car.<br />
<br />
In Bubba&#39;s office, the air was cooler. The slight breeze of a desk fan chilled the room to a reasonable level. The whole office wafted with Bubba’s stink. Troy’s cock hardened.<br />
<br />
Bubba motioned for Troy to turn around. Troy backed himself up against the wall and Bubba unbuckled Troy&#39;s pants from behind. He reached down into the front, gripping Troy&#39;s cock in his meaty hands. It almost felt like his cock receded an inch in the man’s meaty hands, though it grew wider and thicker. Troy’s balls swelled and stretched the fabric of a jockstrap he didn’t remember wearing. <br />
<br />
Troy moaned, surrendering all control over to Bubba.<br />
<br />
The massive man played with Troy&#39;s manhood, jerking it a few times. He clearly liked how Troy quaked when he touched him. The subtle movement of flesh with each tremor. Troy couldn’t help himself from quivering under Bubba’s tender ministrations; He’d had wet dreams of this day for months, now.<br />
<br />
Bubba lowered his head towards Troy&#39;s neck, his beard scratching the skin. He kissed him repeatedly, using his tongue to slide up and down the side of the cub’s neck. He began to suck hard, squeezing the skin with his lips. Troy gasped, then moaned sagging into Bubba’s embrace. The big bear left his mark on his boy.<br />
<br />
The huge head mechanic then knelt the ground, the floor vibrating as his knees touched down. He slid down Troy&#39;s jeans and jockstrap, freeing Troy’s turgid shaft. Bubba slapped an exposed, hairy asscheek with one hand, making a resounding *whop*-ping noise. Troy yelped from the sting. <br />
<br />
Bubba delicately used both hands to spread Troy&#39;s ass, exposing his hole to the cool office air. Troy shivered. He had never been so vulnerable. The bear decided to grease Tory’s hole using his spit as a lubricant. The cub knew a greased machine was better for use and moaned as Bubba’s warm, moist tongue slid along the outside of his quivering orifice. A saliva-slicked finger gently wriggled its way past his ring, almost making Troy cum right there.<br />
<br />
“Ya got a nice fat ass, cub,” Bubba growled, beard bristling between Troy’s cheeks.<br />
<br />
Troy’s toes curled. “Y-yes Daddy!”<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna claim it,” Bubba said, writing one final thing into his notebook.<br />
<br />
Troy clenched his teeth as his hole spasmed repeatedly. Memories of Bubba claiming him every time he brought his big rig in for service filling his mind. He felt an orgasm rise but was quickly cut off as the big bear’s finger pressed a spot on Troy’s hairy gooch. He gasped as the wonderful feeling of successive orgasms receded, the memories fading, the most recent from last week. His saliva-slicked hole slacked, completely loose.<br />
<br />
He had no time to think about anything, as the massive man loomed over him, his gut pressing him against the wall. Bubba’s beercan-thick cock prodded his entrance and Troy moaned. Then, with one smooth, practiced motion, the big bear bucked his hips, his cock thrusting all the way to the hilt, stretching Troy’s hole.<br />
<br />
His breath wheezed out of him, and he gasped, feeling too full to even breathe. The cock withdrew. Troy moaned as he caught his breath, arms barely propping himself against the wall as Bubba’s hot breath blew against his hairy neck. The big cock glided back in, rubbing Troy’s prostate, then pulled out, leaving Troy feeling oddly empty.<br />
<br />
“Hngh,” Troy moaned, his hole suddenly stretched wide with another buck of Bubba’s hips, his cheeks clapping as the bear bottomed out again. <br />
<br />
Troy clawed at the wall, legs shaking, the sensations of the massive man entering him, using him, overloading Troy’s brain. He felt a huff of hot air, the cock withdrawing to just the tip, leaving Troy to writhe and moan. Then, Bubba hilted him again with a soft *pap* as the bear’s balls slapped up against Troy’s asscheeks.  <br />
<br />
The cub blinked away confused tears of pleasure. He felt so full, so stretched by Bubba’s thick, veiny girth. The big bear was really claiming him! His own short, thick cock drooled precum. Bubba nuzzled Troy’s neck, breathing in his scent. Troy leaned back, enjoying the bear’s metal and oil musky scent.<br />
<br />
Bubba plowed into his prostate faster and faster. Troy’s toes curled in his work boots, feeling a rising pressure deep inside him. He squirmed, the cock stretching him so nicely. The bear was pivoting into him, balls thwapping against his cheeks. Nothing mattered any more, his focus was all on the glide of the huge cock against his prostate, the pants of Daddy fucking him right. The pressure rose and rose, and Troy felt his cock spasm, precum splattering the wall. <br />
<br />
“Daddy, I-I’m, I’m gonna…” Troy gasped.<br />
<br />
Bubba bent his head and took another bit of Troy’s neck between his teeth and sucked, adding another hickey to the collection on the right side of the cub’s tender neck. Then the big bear slammed him down on his cock and began to bounce him. Troy scrabbled against the wall, struggling to keep himself from falling as Bubba thrust relentlessly against his prostate. Waves of warmth radiated from his hole as the big cock drove into him deep and hard. His balls churned and tensed, his asshole clenching around the thick, veiny dick, and his orgasm hit.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Daddy!” Troy groaned as his short, thick cock spasmed, ropes of hot seed painting the wall white.<br />
<br />
Bubba growled and thrust deep before he shuddered in orgasm, cock flexing and spewing a hot wetness deep in Troy’s hole, claiming him. He thrust, through the ejaculation, churning his cum deep. Troy whimpered as his insides were flooded, legs growing weak.<br />
<br />
The big bear pulled out, a gush of cum spattering on the floor between their legs. Troy collapsed against the wall, gasping for air. He clenched his hole as best he could, trying to hold in as much of Bubba’s virile jism as he could.<br />
<br />
Troy caught his breath and staggered to his feet, using the wall as support, almost slipping on his own cumshots. He pulled down his wifebeater, unconcerned that it didn’t cover his starter belly completely. Then he hitched up his jeans, buckling them so his crack was exposed, not that they could go any higher. He wanted to buy new ones, but he kept outgrowing them ever since he started long-hauling. Plus, the boys always liked to see a good crack, so it wasn’t a pressing issue.<br />
<br />
The overweight trucker cub stumbled out the door of the office.<br />
<br />
“Troy,” Bubba boomed.<br />
<br />
Troy turned in time to catch a hat with the Bubba’s Body Shop logo on it. He stared at it then back at the massive bear of a man, who’d settled himself back at his desk. As though sensing the stare Bubba glanced up from his paperwork.<br />
<br />
“You’ve earned it, cub. Wear it with pride.” Bubba winked, then went back to studying his clipboard. “You’re an official member of our Trucker’s Club.”<br />
<br />
Troy grinned, heart fluttering, and pulled the cap over his bald head. He scratched his beard, adjusted his jockstrap, then waddled out of the garage with an ass full of cum. A few mechanics glanced over at him and gave him thumbs ups and wolf whistles. His grin widened. Now he was an official member! He could access the back of the garage now whenever Bubba and Sam had their special parties.<br />
<br />
He stumbled out into the cool air, blinking at the brightness of the sun. He walked to his car not caring that his big nips were lewdly exposed, his moobs having slipped out the sides of his wifebeater. There was a sharp pinching sensation that made his gasp as his thick nips were suddenly pierced though the pain faded as quickly as the redness had. He’d gotten them months ago now.<br />
<br />
Sam looked up from where he lay on the hood of Troy’s old beater. Troy smiled and waved, rubbing his arm as a tattoo of a big rig etched itself into his hairy skin. His neck prickled as Ten-Four was tattooed in old English there. He was a big truck-head, after all. The bear paw that tattooed itself on one exposed shoulder advertised something a bit different.<br />
<br />
“Lookin’ good, Troy,” Sam hopped off the hood and sauntered over to him, green eyes glinting. “Bubba sort you out?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yea,” Troy smiled and pointed at his hat. “I’m in the club!”<br />
<br />
“Aw, there’s that smile! Hat suits you big guy!” Sam threw an arm over Troy’s shoulder and lifted the brim, smiling at the bald skin beneath it. “Guess what, I found you a truck, Buck!”<br />
<br />
“Buck,” Troy mumbled, nuzzling into Sam’s arm and smelling his musk, cock hardening again.<br />
<br />
“Yer nickname,” Sam reminded.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm,” Buck replied, tongue lapping at the hot guy’s sweat. There was a light stab of pain as his tongue was pierced, which distracted from his thoughts shifting. All the guys here called him that. It was his trucker tag after all. “Truck?”<br />
<br />
“Boy, ya sure are more friendly.” Sam gently pulled him away. “Come on, let me show you what I got for ya.”<br />
<br />
“But I got a car,” Buck said.<br />
<br />
“I’m talkin about a real truck, not some old beater,” Sam scoffed. “I know yer good for it. Look!”<br />
<br />
Buck looked up, hitching his jeans, and his jaw dropped. A cherry-red, fully restored, 1975 Ford F250 Highboy. He glanced at the price tag and swallowed. $30K. That was… he frowned, well within his budget? Ever since he’d started trucking he’d managed to bank $150K in his savings account.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Fuck yeah, I’ll buy it,” Buck grinned and held out his hand.<br />
<br />
Sam grinned and shook it. “Knew you’d love it. Practically called your name when I saw it.”<br />
<br />
“You bought it for me?”<br />
<br />
“Restored it for ya, Buck. I just figgered you&#39;ll be coming around here more to get yer new truck maintained.&quot; Sam winked.<br />
<br />
“What about the cars,” Buck asked, finally remembering why he’d come here in the first place. <br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t worry about them cars. You’ll never have stolen’em by tomorrow. Yer a trucker, why wouldja need ta steal cars?” Sam smiled and shook his head.<br />
<br />
“Right,” Buck blinked and nodded, though something about that wasn’t quite right. “Yeah.”<br />
<br />
“They’ll be gone by tomorrow,” Sam patted Buck’s hairy arm reassuringly. “Just go home with yer new jalopy, have a beer, and when ya wake up it’ll all be okay.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… yeah.” Buck nodded, feeling woozy. “Let me get my stuff out of the car.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll run yer card, then the title’s yer’s,” Sam said, running back into the shop. <br />
<br />
Buck got the keys, signed for the truck and paid for it. He could feel Sam’s eyes on him the whole time. The handsome guy took his money and handed him the title and keys, even took a few hundred off for his old car, too! He lifted himself into the truck and started it up, enjoying the purr of the engine. Yeah, this was what he lived.<br />
<br />
His phone rang. <br />
<br />
Buck unclasped it from its belt holster and answered it.<br />
<br />
“Hello?” Buck asked, voice deeper and huskier.<br />
<br />
“Buck? No luck here.” Dustin’s voice was sad.<br />
<br />
“Ain’t a problem. Cars’ll be gone in the mornin’,” Buck replied, peeling out of the Body Shop and driving back to their apartment. “Meet ya at home.”<br />
<br />
“Okay. You sure?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Sam said he guarantee&#39;s it,” Buck snorted. “And I got into the Trucker’s Club.”<br />
<br />
“Grats man, I know you were hoping for it.” Dustin sounded relieved. “See you at home.”<br />
<br />
Buck hung up and scratched his beard, shifting his heavy body in the truck’s seat, trying to get comfortable. He glanced up at his chubby, bearded face in the rear view mirror and watched as Sam trotted happily into the shop. Man, it was so refreshing to not have nothin’ ta worry about!</p>
