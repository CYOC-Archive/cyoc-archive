<br />
Following Billy into the large room, Alex&#39;s nostrils were immediately flooded with the same intoxicating incense from his own massage. Breathing deeply he felt his head spin and his cock throb inside his loin cloth before shaking his head and looking around. <br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t been noticed yet as Billy had introduced himself to Mr Oren and was guiding him to sit at the edge of the large table in the center of the room.<br />
<br />
The large room had an slight breeze running through it, and as Alex stepped forward his skin prickled, small goosebumps forming and then disappearing in the gentle breeze. Looking in the direction of the wind, Alex found himself looking out a balcony across the rooftops and into the large pastures outside the city, yet the smokey incence was not drifting out of the room, a faint blue glowing around the edges of the doorway indicating that an enchantment was keeping the incense concentrated within.<br />
<br />
Approaching the table, Alex finally heard Billy address him, asking him to give Mr Oren his special complementary pre massage potion.  Gently lifting the yellow vial from the large tray, Alex raised his head to find himself looking directly into the glowing purple eyes of Tarith Oren. The same man he had seen in the heated baths.<br />
<br />
(Wisdom check DC 15, roll 6 -2 WIS modifier, result 4 FAIL)<br />
The faint feeling that something was off earlier had started to rise, but Alex found his mind going blank, as he stared dumbly into the gentle smile Tarith gave him. Never looking away as he gently lifted the large yellow vial and consumed every drop within, his tongue gently licking along the edges of the vial before handing it back to Alex with a silent nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex, place the tray down and light those candles while I prepare our esteemed guest.&quot;<br />
A quick nod and Alex busied himself as Billy&#39;s voice softened, his posture and tone gentle and submissive, despite the significant size difference between him and the short, slender man before him.<br />
&quot;Master Oren, please lay face down on the table when you are ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, I have been looking forward to this all day. Mr Vindegrast is not truly aware of how far word of your skills has travelled.&quot; Tarith finally spoke, his voice authoritative, powerful without needing volume. His words sending a small shudder down Alex&#39;s spine as he lit the final candle, noting the room seeming to warm slightly, the faint blue enchantments around the room turning a warm orange colour.<br />
Turning back around, Alex found Tarith was still sitting on the side of the table, his gaze travelling over Alex&#39;s body, the feeling causing Alex&#39;s cock to twitch as his mind fought between trying to complete his quest and the urge to quit the game suddenly.<br />
<br />
Alex was 100% straight and he was well beyond his comfort zone. His in game body was rock hard and he didn&#39;t know why, and he was hoping that the game wasn&#39;t going to try to force him into anything sexual. Although nothing like that had happened with Billy, and he was supported by Billy for this mission.<br />
<br />
Tarith finally lay down, Billy lifting the first bottle of oil from the tray, guiding Alex to pick up the second one, they slowly dripped the warm oil of Tarith&#39;s smooth back. Alex noting a tattoo of a hawk with a cobra in its talons on Tarith&#39;s right shoulder blade as Billy started spreading the oil with his large hands.<br />
<br />
(Dexterity skill check DC5, rolled 2, +4 DEX modifier, +2 massage skill, result 8 SUCCESS)<br />
<br />
Remembering his own massage and his goal, Alex quickly pushed his reservations to the side, mirroring Billy&#39;s broad sweeping strokes with a moments delay, their hands quickly spreading the warm oil all over Tarith&#39;s back and arms, Billy firmly massaging each muscle, then guiding Alex with quiet whispers of &quot;softer&quot; as he continued with each muscle while Billy moved onto the next.<br />
<br />
Tarith&#39;s body was slowly becoming limp as all the tension in his body was released, Billy giving Alex an approving smile before he guided Tarith to turn onto his back.<br />
<br />
Repeating the same process along Tarith&#39;s slender but firm chest, Alex became acutely aware of the feeling of the man&#39;s warm flesh under his fingers as he chased Billy&#39;s motions, his fingers tracing through the small divets between Tariths abs. <br />
Alex realized all he could hear was the deep laboured breathing of all three men and the quiet slopping noise of their oiled up hands sliding across the diplomats body.<br />
Alex&#39;s heart was racing as he felt his own erection pulsing with strong need, his mind suppressing all sexual thoughts as it was occupied following Billy&#39;s instructions.<br />
Finally the accumulated incense in the room was filling Alex&#39;s lung, making it slightly hard to breath, the aroma slowly becoming more and more intoxicating.<br />
<br />
(Dexterity skill check DC 10, roll 11, +4 DEX modifier, +2 Massage, result 17 PASS)<br />
<br />
Billy nodded to Alex as he started to work on Tarith&#39;s neck and shoulders, Alex responding to the cue, poured more oil onto Tarith&#39;s legs, slowly working the mixture in as he progressed lower and lower, finally reaching the man&#39;s feet.<br />
<br />
Alex remembered how powerful the foot massage had been for him, and was able to replicate every single detail, exactly where and when to apply pressure, how to move his fingers to release each tendon, mobilize each joint, lighting up each nerve with new pleasurable sensations.<br />
So caught up in this, Alex didn&#39;t notice Tarith&#39;s  purple loin cloth bulging upwards, his intense gaze up into Billy&#39;s eyes. The subtle biting of his own lips as he wordlessly egged Billy on. Dilly&#39;s own cock pulsing, straining against his loin cloth.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t notice Billy looking down at him, assessing him with an intensity as he focused solely on the feet before him.<br />
<br />
(Multi difficulty Constitution DC check. 5,10,15, roll 10, +5 CON bonus, -6 temporary modifiers, result 9 Pass DC 5, FAIL DC 10 + DC 15)<br />
<br />
It took Billy repeating his name three times before Alex snapped out of his foot massage trance and looked up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Time swap places.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded, his blue eyes glazed over slightly and his pupils large and dilated. Swaying slightly as he made his way to the other end of the table, Alex found himself staring down into the same purple eyes, his brain vaguely aware of the intense heat radiating though him, flowing into him from Tarith&#39;s oiled up body.<br />
<br />
Alex couldn&#39;t tear his eyes away as he started working the diplomat&#39;s neck and shoulders, the man&#39;s slightly sinister smile no longer unnerving but arousing. Guiding him as he massaged by instinct, no longer aware of anything else happening in the room.<br />
Not aware that Billy had removed his own loin cloth, his own 10 inch erection bobbing angrily with each heartbeat, not aware as Tarith&#39;s purple loincloth was discarded, his 7 inches twitching as it was exposed to the warm room air, the partially exposed head an angry red peeking through the end of his foreskin, a large pearl of pre cum forming at the opening of his piss slit.<br />
<br />
Alex was zoned out, his body shuddering as he was guided wordlessly by Tarith&#39;s hypnotic stare, his complex thought patterns broken down by the accumulation of chemically induced lust as every nerve in his body overloaded his mind with heightened sensations. <br />
<br />
Alex didn&#39;t even register Tarith&#39;s hands tracing up and down the back of his legs, slowly teasing him until they reached the small knots holding his loincloth together at the sides.<br />
<br />
(Alex erect cock size first time roll 1d6 +4, rolled 5, result 9)<br />
Alex groan as his loin cloth was pulled away, the fabric brushing against his flared glans. <br />
The pair of hands gently kneading his muscular buns as he was slowly guided forward. <br />
Tarith&#39;s head tilting backwards as Billy lowered the head rest, the man&#39;s eyes disappearing from view as he started to swallow Billy&#39;s cock, inch by inch into his well practiced throat.<br />
Alex could do nothing but stare and moan as his long but average thickness cock slowly disappeared down the hot wet throat, Tarith&#39;s tongue lapping along the top edges of his shaft as every nerve fiber in his dick lit up.  An electrical storm of pleasure shooting into his brain.<br />
<br />
Billy was suddenly next to him, his hot breath in his ear as his deep groans egged him on, causing him to slowly buck his hips, building a slow but steady rhythm as he started to mindlessly fuck Tarith&#39;s throat.<br />
<br />
All three men were sweating heavily by this point, their scent combining with the oil and incense to create an intoxication aroma that had them all breathing in through their noses heavily, eyes glazed over as they slowly descended towards mindless rutting.<br />
<br />
Alex could feel the cum bubbling up from within him, the realization hitting him that he was about to cum inside a guys throat causing him to lose his rhythm, shaking his head he stepped back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-wait. Wh-whats happening to me-me?&quot; He stammered as Billy gently guided Alex&#39;s head so he was looking into Tarith&#39;s eyes, the man&#39;s gaze suddenly much more powerful, imposing.<br />
Alex fought mentally for a brief moment against the intensity of that mind numbing gaze, but he was so close to cumming that his mind could no longer resist.<br />
<br />
Going silent, with his mouth drooping open, Tarith kept his gaze locked.<br />
Billy leant close, whispering into Alex&#39;s ear.<br />
&quot;He want&#39;s you to fuck him. That&#39;s what it will take for him to sign the trade deal papers. Didn&#39;t his mouth and throat feel amazing?&quot; Billy ran his tongue along the edge of Alex&#39;s ear as a dumb smile spread across his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then go fuck that tight hole! It&#39;s going to feel amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tight.... hole..... amazing....&quot;<br />
Alex murmured as he was lead around the table by Billy, A large warm hand briefly sliding up and down his cock as the oil was applied, before Billy turned his attention to oiling up Tarith’s exposed hole.<br />
<br />
Alex stepped forward, unable to look away or think clearly, compelled under the strange mans gaze. <br />
He placed his cock head against the opening of Tarith’s ass, slowly pressing forward he felt himself slowly enter, the warm tightness allowing his dick to slowly sink in as Tarith let out a deep throaty moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good my young man. No don&#39;t cum until I let you. That also applies to you Master Masseuse.&quot; Tarith commanded with a sly tone as he guided Alex forward, so his knees were on the table, Tarith&#39;s legs on his shoulders, his weight pressing down on top of the diplomats slicked up body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t.... Cum...&quot; <br />
Alex briefly thought as he started bucking his hips, building up to a blinding pace, guided wordlessly by the powerful gaze, their bodies burning hot as hot wet slapping sounds filled the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t... Cum...&quot;<br />
Alex muttered again, his bodies need to cum building higher and higher as a small voice in the back of his mind started to reach out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t... Cum...&quot;<br />
Tarith was breathing rapidly, his body quivering under Alex&#39;s vigorous fucking, load groans filling the room as Billy stood observing, his own hardness ignored as not to break any of Tarith’s or his masters instructions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t!... Cum!&quot;<br />
The small voice was louder now, gaining traction as Alex&#39;s half mind was already trying to follow that order, so close to the edge but compelled to obey.<br />
<br />
&quot;DON&#39;T!...CUM!&quot;<br />
The voice finally broke through, the fog in Alex&#39;s mind clearing just enough that he was aware of what he was doing, but his body was so on fire with pleasure there was no way he could stop now.<br />
<br />
Tarith saw the slight change inside Alex&#39;s eyes, and grinned evilly.<br />
&quot;NOW you can cum BOY. Shoot it all deep inside me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DON&#39;T CUM!!!!!!!&quot;<br />
Alex&#39;s mind screamed as his body was allowed to go over the edge. An almost inhuman roar echoed throughout the chamber which Alex recognized as his own voice as his body collapsed forward, his hips still thrusting furiously, every pleasure nerve on his body firing at once, his mind feeling like it was melting under such intense pleasure.<br />
<br />
Alex twitched and spasmed on top of Tarith for a few long moments as his cock emptied every single drop of semen he had inside the diplomat, the young man groaning and gasping for air as his orgasm slowly subsided.<br />
<br />
It took nearly a minute after his orgasm had subsided that Alex snapped to attention, jumping off the table rapidly, panic clearly plastered all over his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;OBEY!&quot;<br />
<br />
A single word. Spoken out loud but heard deep within his very being. Alex was not looking at Tarith, trying desperately to find an escape from the situation, his mind already trying to force quit the game when the command stunned him. He found himself standing at attention, as if he were about to receive new orders from the guard commander as Tarith lay back on the table, guiding Billy forward who proceeded to mount him, the larger man fucking Tarith with deep, slow thrusts as he spoke to Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;You WILL remember today, but you will find yourself forgetting the details rapidly, only able to remember the pleasure of mindlessly obeying and of giving into your bodies desires. Now go take these papers to Mr Vindegrast NOOB. Maybe we&#39;ll meet again.... if you survive long enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
A small stats window appeared suddenly over Tarith&#39;s head, indicating him as a level 9 wizard, and also another human player.<br />
Alex was stunned, shocked at the power of the spell on him and how his mind seemed to just bend under it, the details of the last few hours starting to slip away with every step down the hallway until he reached Mr Vindegrasts office. <br />
<br />
Alex looked at the papers in his hands, before reviewing his quest journal, his mind filled with vague memories of intense pleasure, a strong commanding will and the scent of the room, filled with the magically enhanced pheromones and musk of naked fucking men.<br />
<br />
Entering the office he handed the papers to Mr Vindegrast, who took them silently, quickly scouring each line of the rolled parchments before turning back to Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had my doubts guard SteelShield, but you have proved me wrong. He has signed each trade document with his magical seal. Several new trade routes can be run as soon as the caravans are ready. Now...&quot;<br />
<br />
The shorter man turned, regarding Alex&#39;s glistening body with a slight smirk.<br />
&quot;While I approve of your methods, I am sure the order would disagree with actions that involve your own self gratification...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what do you mean by tha-&quot;<br />
Alex started, looking down to see himself completely naked, a long strand of cum trailing from the end of his 5&quot; flaccid cock, swaying in the gentle night breeze before the end landed on his thigh, sticking there.<br />
Alex stood dumbfounded, his mind assaulted by a short series of images, smells, sounds and sensations which caused his emptied balls to ache slightly before he shook his head.<br />
<br />
(Charisma skill check DC10, rolled 5 + 3 CHA modifier, result 8 FAIL)<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I-.&quot; Swallowing hard Alex fought for an excuse. &quot;I did what I did for the good of the town, Mr Vindegrast.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;BWAHAHAHAHA.&quot; The shorter man burst into a loud cackling laughter that caused his large stomach to bounce. <br />
&quot;If that was the truth, why did you not return with both the documents AND Billy. No, guard SteelShield. You finished first and Billy is in their giving our guest the REST of what he desired. YOU clearly enjoyed yourself though. HAHAHA.&quot; <br />
As the shorter mans laughter died down, he regarded Alex again, noticing the goosebumps that appeared and disappeared with the gentle caress of the wind from the open window.<br />
&quot;MARJORIE.&quot; He bellowed out, the small women appearing through the door a minute later, clearly out of breathe from sprinting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.....   Master.......Vinde.....Grast.&quot; The small women gasped as she fought for air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Inventory check for potion consumption.&quot; He muttered, dismissively pointing at Alex who was now covering his cum slicked genitals with his hands, his cheeks burning bright red in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Marjorie touched her necklace which briefly glowed with a pale blue light. Alex felt a shudder run through his body as the ghostly key from before emerged from his chest. floating for a brief moment before wisps of light started to rise above it, the col ours shifting into 5 separate marble sized spheres of light, the key itself receding back inside Alex&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm. One Blue, One Red, and.... THREE yellow!?! What is the meaning of this? Who else gave you potions tonight other then Billy?&quot;<br />
<br />
(Intelligence skill check DC 10, roll 10 +1 INT modifier, result 11)<br />
&quot;Ummm, Dimas did... but I only drank two yellow potions....&quot;<br />
Alex replied, doing the maths in his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;DIMAS!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
It took two long minutes for Dimas to appear, casually strolling into the office with the same look of disinterest on his face as before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; He asked with an irritated tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many potions did you give this man!?!&quot;<br />
Mr Vindegrast was barely withholding his rage, a large blood vessel bulging on his forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gave him a double dose of yellow at the EXPLICIT request of...&quot; <br />
Dimas paused when he noticed Alex standing naked in the room, a cruel smirk spreading across his face.<br />
<br />
Marjorie gasped, before noticing Alex staring at her and silently fleeing the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know who, BUT you failed to notify Billy of this and so he has received a third dose within a single day!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see what the issue is, many people would LOVE to have....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;silence.&quot; Mr Vindegrast spoke the word silently but dimas complied immediately, fear slowly spreading across his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guard SteelShield, Please restrain this criminal.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Dexterity skill check DC 10, roll 19 + 4 DEX modifier, result 23 SUCCESS)<br />
(Strength skill check DC 10 - Dexterity success factor 12, AUTOMATIC SUCCESS)<br />
<br />
Alex launched himself forward, aiming not directly at Dimas but closer to the doorway a few steps behind him. He had anticipated the arrogant man&#39;s reaction perfectly, who in turning to flee placed himself directly in Alex&#39;s path. With a loud thud, Alex used his momentum to slam Dimas into the wall next to the arch, the impact knocking the air out of him, leaving him gasping and completely unable to resist being tied to the heaviest chair in the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good, Mr SteelShield, I can see why the knights chose you for the trials. Such speed! Now, this arrogant little fool...&quot; The older man forcefully slapping the bound man hard across the face. &quot;Is a traitor who had his friends kidnap Kiron, Billy&#39;s protege, and have been demanding regular payments for the last few days for his safety and that of my remaining staff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pulling a small vial of green liquid from his pocket, and gingerly lifting a letter opener from his desk, Mr Vindegrast applied the contents of the vial along the blades edge, before confidently stepping forward and slashing a large cut open on Dimas arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now he will talk or he will die. The poison will kill him within 6 hours and I will NOT provide the antidote until Kiron is returned. Now Dimas...&quot; <br />
The short man circling the bound writhing figure, ignoring his pleading and crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;...tell us everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few short minutes later, Dimas had revealed that three of his friends were keeping Kiron prisoner in the basement of one of their houses, a few minutes walk away.  He had a key to the backdoor right next to the basement entrance, and they had all agreed to kill Kiron and run if they were discovered.<br />
<br />
Marjorie had fetched Alex&#39;s items and armor, the muscular brunette keenly aware of every brush of fabric or metal against his skin. He had mentally prepared for the next task and was almost ready to set out when Mr Vindegrast stopped him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you head out and do your duty as a guard there as something that you should know. The yellow potion dimas gave you makes you more sensitive to pleasurable stimulation for a short amount of time, however, drinking too much within a short amount of time leaves a permanent mark on people. You have only had three doses, but from now on you will find your body is more sensitive to any and all stimulation. It is both a blessing and a curse. For that I am sorry my dear man.Also...&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning to face Dimas who was visibly sweating and shaking now as the poison started to spread. <br />
<br />
&quot;...if you do not return with Kiron in time, I WILL allow Dimas to die for what he has done to the other staff here. If you do return on time, you may take him to prison, along with your other rewards for service.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But..... what if he dies?&quot;  Dimas groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you die.&quot; Mr Vindegrast&#39;s voice was cold, causing Dimas to sob.<br />
<br />
Alex turned to leave, walking quickly as he knew a paladin should show mercy, and was almost out the door when Dimas cried out.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait. There’s more... More I should tell you. There’s a fourth person. Jakob, my friends f-father. He is dangerous. And-and there is also a trap. On the stairs down to the basement. Its aimed at the thirds step from the top from underneath. A blade that hobble intruders.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dimas burst into tears again as Alex listened before heading off.<br />
<br />
Stepping onto the street, a loud chime rung out in the air, the world around stopping as Alex felt  a surge of power within him.<br />
<br />
He looked inside himself and realized he was leveling up.<br />
Alex watched as the options loaded up, noting that certain abilities would not be available until he was sworn in as a paladin of the order.<br />
<br />
First he saw he could chose a fighting style, and knowing he was supposed to be helping his brothers character when they finally met up, he chose protective style.<br />
<br />
He then saw he had received a weakened version of Divine sense,allowing him to sense creatures of both good and evil, and Divine smite, allowing him to put holy energy into attacks against evildoers.<br />
<br />

Special Skills<br />
Passive Skill: The Cursed Hero: You will level up quickly, but luck is not your friend, and evil will be attracted to you.<br />
<br />
Lay on hands: The paladin can heal another by touching them and calling upon their faith. The Paladin can use this once per day, but gains a use every third level and the healing effects gains strength with every level. This skill is weakened until inducted into the order.<br />
<br />
Divine Sense: The player can open their awareness to sense the nature of creatures around them. Good or evil. This ability is weakened, and can only be used once per day until inducted into the order.<br />
<br />
Divine Smite: The player can imbue their physical attacks with divine energy. This ability is weakened, and can only be used once per day until inducted into the order. The player may imbue 1d8 additional damage into their weapons.<br />
Smooth Talker: The player gains a bonus during persuasion attempts by choosing their approach from a selected character stat. For example a player with a high intelligence could bluff someone based on their general knowledge around a topic.  <br />
<br />
Fighting Style -Protective: The player can roll to interrupt attacks against allies within 5 feet. This may lower their chance to hit or completely intercept them. This skill is modified based on equipped weapons.<br />
<br />
Massage: The player has gained moderate skill in providing full body massages. The Player receives +2 to all Strength, Dexterity checks when giving someone a massage, or any other roll aimed at using their hands in an erotic way on another being.<br />
<br />
Traits: Sensitive. Exposure to too much arousal potion has left you more susceptible to erotic stimuli. -2 modifier for defence against all erotic stimuli.<br />
