<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So here Jeff was, lying naked in the grass beside his newly alive identical twin, Jeffie. &quot;So,&quot; the clone finally said, after the post-orgasmic bliss had ebbed and they had both caught their breath. &quot;What&#39;s the plan now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked and took a deep breath, thinking. He stared at his clone and saw the love and excitement in embedded in his eyes. &quot;I have no idea.&quot; he replied, shrugging.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you and you love me, right?&quot; the clone asked. &quot;Are you going to keep me or throw me away?&quot; He paused and looked straight into his maker&#39;s eyes. &quot;It was incredible meeting you and seeing your love and care. Being your new best friend, lover, and more, was even better, but what now, Jeff. Is our relationship forever?&quot;  He bit his lower lip.  &quot;I mean, I&#39;m just a sock that you turned into a boy, and you can just turn me back.  You&#39;ve given me the best introduction to life possible and,&quot; he glanced away, &quot;and I don&#39;t want to stop existing by going back to being nothing but a sock.  No thoughts, no feelings, no emotion, no personality, just a piece of fabric.&quot; Tears welled up in the clone&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
Jeff could tell his clone was torn at the idea of returning to lifeless cloth, especially after experiencing his existence since his growth into humanity.  Jeff initially chose the sock because of his many intimate jack-off sessions into it, and it was definitely the most intimate thing he owned.  He had never weighed or considered the magnitude of what it might really be like to make a sentient clone, at least not till the process was halfway complete. He loved every second of it now and his heart broke a little just thinking of throwing away all that his clone had learned and gained, everything he&#39;d become.  That they&#39;d become.<br />
<br />
He took a deep breath and put a hand on Jeffie&#39;s cheek, looking him straight in the eyes. &quot;Babe,&quot; Jeff said, his tone firm but full of power. &quot;No.&quot; He paused for a long moment before speaking again. &quot;Yes, you were my jizz encrusted sock, yes that sounds fucked up, and I can only imagine what thoughts about it might go through your head, but none of that matters now.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I fell in love with the boy who showed up out of thin-air, out of my dirty socks and has been the best buddy I could have ever have asked for.&quot; A small smile spread across his face. &quot;I fell in love with you,&quot; Jeff said, &quot;how could you think I would ever throw you away?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Jeffie asked, his expression changing, his heart lighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, really.&quot; Jeff replied, pulling him close.<br />
<br />
Jeffie smiled, the warmth and joy rising from within. He cuddled into Jeff&#39;s shoulder and as he looked out into the horizon and his heart lifted. The air felt cool against his naked flesh, but the the sun and warmth of his lover heated his heart.<br />
 <br />
Jeff wrapped his arms around his clone, their naked bodies entwining. &quot;You know, you&#39;re the only one who gets this?&quot; he whispered. &quot;You&#39;re the only one to experience these exact sensations, this exact existence, the same emotions, feelings, and everything.&quot; He looked at Jeffie. &quot;What happens next? This world is as much mine as it is now yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, are you giving me, the newest of newbies, permission to help you plan our days ahead?&quot; Jeffie asked, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a yes,&quot; Jeff responded, returning the smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, it&#39;s weird.&quot; Jeffie chuckled. &quot;How, like, all day, I was thinking how strange it was you made me. You can change it all so easily, like a snap of a finger and end it all. When you made me I wanted a good life, to feel myself.  I&#39;m real, I got to influence the world around me.  Life isn&#39;t perfect and if you only wanted to keep me for a small part of it then I was grateful for that small part,&quot; his cheeks flushed, &quot;with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I really meant it, Jeffie.&quot; He pulled Jeffie even closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;When we go back home what are we going to do?  Your parents and sister?  How do we explain this to them?&quot;  He paused.  &quot;And what about school?  Do we just show up to the classroom hand in hand?  And your friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Jeff hesitated. &quot;There is a way we can make it all work out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie leaned back and quizzically raised an eyebrow. &quot;How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can use the Chronivac.&quot; He glanced up.  &quot;We use it to change reality a little so that everyone I know would know who you are.  We can&#39;t change too much,&quot; he blushed, &quot;like making it normal for twins to have sex or things will get weird because there&#39;s no telling the consequences,&quot; he sighed, &quot;and there are consequences.  The bigger the change the bigger the universe seems to react to it.&quot;  &quot;We might still have to hide that we&#39;re, you know, together, for now.  But, yeah, I think that could work.&quot; He grinned. &quot;We&#39;d look the same, and act the same, and,&quot; Jeff laughed, &quot;people won&#39;t have to get freaked out over having an exact, identical clone walking around, they&#39;ll just think we&#39;re really close twins.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie&#39;s eyes opened wide and his jaw hung agape. &quot;Holy shit! That&#39;s awesome! I can&#39;t believe that was an option. Can we really do that?!&quot; He grinned. &quot;How soon can we start the new and improved Jeff and Jeffie show?&quot; he said, a little breathless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awe man. We just finished our pilot episode.&quot; His voice went high and nasally.  &quot;It&#39;s all about the rating&#39;s Jeffie, What about the ratings?  How can we continue without the ratings.&quot;  Jeff laughed.<br />
<br />
Jeffie giggled too. &quot;How will we live up to that? People already think we&#39;re kinda geeky and now, they&#39;re gonna expect the world&#39;s greatest super awesome brothers act, when we really, really, really suck!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bahahahaha&quot;  Jeff grinned, then sucked on Jeffie&#39;s cheek, &quot;You&#39;re right, we really, really do suck.&quot;<br />
The two chuckled together.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make it so you can use the Chronivac too,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap! Wait. I could go and have all sorts of crazy adventures? Oh shit!&quot; Jeffie replied, a huge smile spreading across his face. &quot;Infinite pocket dimensions to explore and conquer and every wish my heart desired, granted,&quot; his eyes twinkled.<br />
<br />
Jeff flicked his twin&#39;s forehead. &quot;Oi. First off, remember to do stuff that&#39;ll mean something to us and not just your dick, you horny bastard.&quot; He laughed and flicked Jeffie&#39;s forehead again. &quot;Secondly,&quot; Jeffie shrugged, &quot;please don&#39;t mess the time and reality up too much, okay bro?  Remember, consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Jeffie brushed Jeff&#39;s fingers away.  &quot;Stop it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop what,&quot; he flicked again, &quot;this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;ve done it now!&quot; Jeffie crawled onto his maker and pinned him, he flicked Jeff&#39;s forehead several times before Jeff got his arm up and managed to wrestle his twin down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, who&#39;s doing what to who?&quot; Jeff giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Jeffie responded. &quot;This.&quot; He broke his brother&#39;s hold and grabbed a hold of Jeff&#39;s back. Jeff tried to roll him over, but Jeffie managed to block his hands down.  The moment Jeffie&#39;s hand moved, however, Jeff laughed broke free. He pushed his clone back down, before quickly tickling him, digging his fingers in just below Jeffie&#39;s ribs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Argh!&quot; Jeffie cried out, squirming. &quot;Mercy!&quot; He flapped his arms about trying to knock Jeff off, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot;Jeff said. &quot;I know all your weak spots&quot; He grinned.<br />
<br />
Jeffie&#39;ss laughs echoed over the glade. &quot;Fine, you win, you win!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally!&quot; Jeff replied, a smile across his lips and his fingers moving from Jeffie&#39;s ribs to his cheeks.  He leaned in slowly and kissed his creation.  &quot;Come on, lets get home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sat up. Jeffie leaned in close and kissed him again. &quot;Do we really have to get up?&quot; Jeffie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we should probably use the Chronivac as soon as possible so my family,&quot; he paused and smiled at Jeff, &quot;our family don&#39;t freak out.&quot;  Jeff finished lacing his sneakers. &quot;We also have school tomorrow.&quot; He patted his clone on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, tomorrow is Monday.&quot; Jeffie frowned a bit.<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled his eyes. He grabbed his brother&#39;s arm and helped him stand.<br />
<br />
The two teens dressed in silence for a while, stealing quick glances at each other.  They walked hand in hand until Jeffie suddenly stopped and pressed his hand to his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything okay?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My stomach feels weird,&quot; Jeffie replied. &quot;It kinda hurts and kinda feels like my muscles are tense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff tilted his head.  He knelt down, lifted Jeffie&#39;s shirt, and studied his stomach, but everything seemed normal.<br />
<br />
Jeffie pressed his fingers to his temple.  &quot;Jeff something is really wrong with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The alarm on Jeff&#39;s phone went off, and Jeff&#39;s eyes widened in realized horror.  He remembered why he&#39;d set that alarm and he&#39;d completely forgotten that when he made Jeffie he&#39;d put a timer of twenty-four hours on his clone&#39;s life.  Jeffie was turning back into a sock.  This boy he fell in love with was living on borrowed time and Jeff, in his idiocy, had forgotten about it.  He frantically checked his phone.  There were less than five minutes left, and no way to get home in time to change Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Jeff put his arms around his brother&#39;s waist and hugged him. &quot;I-I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; he choked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ngh. For what? Me eating too much pizza last night?&quot; Jeffie replied, trying to smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I forgot.&quot; Jeff&#39;s grip tightened. &quot;In only a couple minutes, you&#39;ll go back into a sock&quot; He struggled not to break into tears. &quot;I forgot about the twenty-four hour timer I put on you.  I didn&#39;t take it off!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Jeffie paled. &quot;I-I just...&quot; he tried to comfort Jeff, but the shock in his voice probably did little to that effect, &quot;we&#39;ll figure this out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we won&#39;t, you&#39;re just a sock when the time runs out.&quot; His eyes were watery and Jeff buried his face into his brother&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I can&#39;t lose you like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie sat and brought his legs to his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-How long?&quot; he finally asked, his own eyes beginning to tear up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Less than three minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie smiled despite himself. &quot;Well,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;If I&#39;m a sock, you could re-clone me again, right.  Y-you could bring me back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But,&quot; Jeff sobbed into his brother&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
Jeffie turned his head and kissed his twin. &quot;It won&#39;t be me, will it,&quot; he said, his voice resigned.<br />
<br />
Jeff could hardly hear those words. His hands grasped around his identical brother&#39;s neck and his knees trembled as a knot formed in his throat.  &quot;Don&#39;t leave me, Babe.&quot; He embraced Jeffie tighter than he&#39;d held anything in his whole life, as if he could press himself through him. &quot;Please, stay, stay with me.&quot; Tears welled up.<br />
<br />
Jeffie smiled, brushing tears off his cheeks. He ran a finger along the curve of his brother&#39;s spine. Jeff let out a deep, quivering sigh.  &quot;You could make me again?  A new one.  I&#39;m sure they&#39;d love you as much as I do.&quot; Jeffie suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, that wouldn&#39;t be, I mean, will it really be you, you&#39;re already, here and, and.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie sighed.  &quot;I wish I could say for sure.&quot;  He winced as he felt something shift inside.  &quot;Something shifted. Oh Shit. Is it happening? Am I already-&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head. &quot;No, no, no,&quot; he looked down, horrified at his clone&#39;s stomach losing its musculature. &quot;Shit, your stomach is definitely shrinking and disappearing.&quot; Jeff cupped Jeffie&#39;s cheek. &quot;Jeffie, I will re-clone you.  It will be you, not some other person, you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could make me a girl copy of you,&quot; Jeffie chucked, his feigned mirth catching in his throat as he tried to make his twin feel a little better, &quot;we could, agh,&quot; he grimaced, &quot;we could have lots of sex.&quot;  Jeffie grimaced again.  &quot;or, ugh, a futa.&quot;  His breathing came quick.  &quot;I-It&#39;s happening.&quot; Pressure grew all around him.  &quot;Jeff, promise me.  Quick. Promise me.  This is my dying wish.  Please.  Agh!  Please!  If this doesn&#39;t work, if you can&#39;t bring me back, promise that you&#39;ll be all right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I,&quot; Jeff started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise,&quot; Jeffie said, clasping at his stomach, his breaths labored as he struggled to keep his form, willing it to stay as long as possible.  It was like clasping at a cliff with someone yanking at you, willing you to fall. Pulling, pulling, pulling.  He couldn&#39;t hold on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Jeff cried. &quot;I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffie reached his lips into his brother. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he breathed, kissing him a final time as he let go of that cliff, letting himself fall. &quot;I-I.. oh, fuck! It hurts!&quot; His entire being shivered, prickling as his cells struggled against his inevitable, and slow, descent back into just being a cum-stained sock.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched in horror, powerless to do anything but hold Jeffie in his arms.  His best friend shriveled, right in front of his eyes. The panic grew as seconds dragged and turned to minutes with his brother still hanging on, gasping, unable to speak, but fighting for every moment he could. <br />
<br />
Jeffie closed his eyes and kissed Jeff one last time again. &quot;I love you-&quot; His voice gave way to escaped air.  The final remnants warmth clung to his Jeff&#39;s lips as Jeffie&#39;s body fully shifted.<br />
<br />
Chronovac&#39;s time limit ran out. Jeffie&#39;s form began to shrink. His legs sank in, followed by his feet, toes, and each toe was sucked into its foot, the foot into the legs, and finally Jeffie&#39;s legs into his torso.  The shirt and pants that once covered his slightly toned body became became baggy, swallowing him as his stomach and arms shrank.<br />
<br />
Then, Jeff&#39;s heart nearly stopped, his brother&#39;s neck and head grew small and withered, his lips parted back into the opening of the sock which absorbed his face and shrunken head.  Jeff fought back tears, clutching at the tiny cloth and fabric, as the tiny hands and fingers of the once proud, full, identical boy to himself, twisted into the worn material.  Jeffie&#39;s shoulders merged into the fabric, and then his body, leaving just a small, white, threadbare sock hanging in Jeff&#39;s hands and a pile of now empty clothes in his arms.<br />
<br />
All was quiet as the sky remained a clear blue above, the trees in the background swayed, the leaves rustling.<br />
Jeff held his now lifeless, original, sock tight and fell onto his rear, breaking down into uncontrollable sobs and pressing the sock to his chest. &quot;Jeffie.&quot; he sobbed.<br />
<br />
Eventually, his breath steadied. He sniffled, and after some minutes of crying and cradling the lifeless material with his touch and skin, Jeff rose his chin and dried his cheeks with his shoulder. Jeff held the stained limp sock in his hand and let the spark of hope burn within that perhaps he could reverse this and bring his clone back, not some other copy but Jeffie, his Jeffie.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-Are,&quot; Jeff cleared his throat, looking down. &quot;A-Are you alive in there Jeffie? Can you see everything, hear anything? Are you aware?&quot; The sock couldn&#39;t answer him of course, and he knew that it was just an object, unaware and unfeeling. &quot;P-Please don&#39;t be dead, be-because, because if you&#39;re not really alive. I&#39;m alone. And I, I need you.&quot; Tears threatened to spill again, though he sniffed them back. &quot;Bro, it&#39;s, it&#39;s okay if only you can hear me or feel this.&quot;  He pressed the sock to his body, his heart beating against it.  &quot;I will grow you again, I promise.&quot;  Jeff carefully held the sock and jogged for home. <br />
<br />
He felt as though a part of him had been missing.  He had lost Jeffie.  The boy who was only a day old, and experienced, truly tasted of, life beyond just cloth.<br />
<br />
Jeff burst through the door of his house and raced into his room.  He laid the sock on the bed, and flipped on the Chronivac.</p>
