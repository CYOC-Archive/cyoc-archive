<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After school, Amy went to the school parking lot, and waited.  After a few minutes, Colin pulled up on his motorcycle.  “Hop on,” he said, pointing to the seat behind him.<br />
<br />
“Isn’t that dangerous?” Amy asked, clearly unsure whether to get on.  <br />
<br />
“Just put your hands around my waist,” Colin assured her, “and hold on tight.”<br />
<br />
Amy hesitated, and then got on, and put her arms around Colin’s powerful waist.  He revved the engine, and they took off, prompting Amy to clutch tightly, and bury her face in the deep valleys of his back.  He sped back to his apartment, navigating the streets with the ease of a practiced veteran.  Only when he stopped entirely did Amy finally release her death-grip on his waist.  <br />
<br />
“That wasn’t so bad, now was it?” Colin asked.<br />
<br />
“I-I suppose not,” Amy finally answered.  Then she began to giggle.  “It was kind of scary, though, especially at first.”<br />
<br />
Colin led her into his basement apartment, to a large couch.  “Do you want anything to drink?” he asked, as she sat down.<br />
<br />
“Not right now, thanks,” came Amy’s reply.<br />
<br />
“Okay then,” said Colin, as he sat beside her.  His huge weight caused the cushions to bend in such a way that Amy began to slide towards him, and had to hold on to the couch with both hands to stop her slide.  She steadied herself, carefully balancing in a way that would prevent further sliding, and then pulled her books from her backpack.  <br />
<br />
“What should we start with,” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Hmm…” murmured Colin, “…let me think.”  He shifted in his seat, and then bent over, so he could remove his jacket without getting up, “I suppose Biology might be good start.”  <br />
<br />
Amy reached for the Biology book, but was distracted by the sight of Colin’s jacket coming off.  Each sleeve was pulled off to reveal glorious shoulders, inhuman biceps and triceps, and thick, powerful forearms.  She stared at the huge muscles, and thick veins that snaked across them.  Regaining her composure, she opened the Biology book.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see, we’re on chapter nine…” she muttered, as she flipped the pages, “Ah, here it is!  Chapter nine: Reproduction.”<br />
<br />
“Great,” Colin smiled, “Why don’t we go over mate selection.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” replied Amy, as her cheeks flushed slightly.  “Well, a mate is usually selected based on characteristics that will ensure that the offspring is better prepared for survival.”<br />
<br />
“What kind of characteristics, Amy?” Colin asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, umm, whichever one has a lot of food and doesn’t get killed by other stuff is the best.”<br />
<br />
“But how would an animal know that, without following the others around all the time?”<br />
<br />
“Well, um, the best providers tend to be the biggest, and the um, strongest in the bunch.”  Amy was blushing.<br />
<br />
“Really?” asked Colin, feigning innocence, “So, like me for example, I would be considered a pretty good catch, right?”<br />
<br />
“Well, yes.  Definitely.  You’re huge!”  <br />
<br />
“Yeah?”  Colin lifted his arms, and flexed them, giving Amy an excellent view of the extent of their size and magnificence.  “So you think I’d make a good mate, right?”<br />
<br />
“Well, uh, um, yeah!”  Amy was now very red-faced.<br />
<br />
“Do you want to feel them?” Colin asked, baiting his lure.<br />
<br />
Amy replied by reaching up, tentatively at first, and placing her hand on Colin’s thick bicep.  Then, she brought her other hand up, and both hands began touching and testing, prodding and feeling.  “Wow,” was all she could say.  <br />
<br />
Colin got up, and knelt on the floor, in front of Amy.  Slowly, he removed his tank-top, revealing his gigantic pecs and bulging, chiseled abs.  Amy leaned over, and placed her hands on his abs, feeling their hardness, tracing their shapes.  She brought her hands up his abs, and to his pecs, where she felt their insane contours, and deep striations.  Reaching his nipples, she let her fingers brush across them, sending shivers down Colin’s spine, and into his rock-hard dick.  Colin leaned in, and kissed Amy.  Amy kissed back.  <br />
<br />
The connection finally made, Colin and Amy entered a frenzy, kissing, caressing, fondling, and murmuring, all while desperately trying to remove the last of their clothes.  When both were finally nude, Colin reached over and picked Amy up, cradling her in his huge arms, and carried her to his bedroom.  He kissed her the entire way, and she kissed him.  He lay her upon his oversized bed, and stood up.  For the first time, she got a look at all of him at once, every piece of pumped-up flesh on display, and she liked what she saw.  <br />
<br />
“Come on, big man,” she encouraged, “you’re clearly the best mate for this cavewoman!”<br />
<br />
Colin laughed, and joined her on the bed, looming above her.  He positioned himself above her, and aimed his fourteen inches at her tight hole.  <br />
<br />
“Do it!” Amy demanded, and Colin complied, sliding his thick cockhead into her twitching pussy.  “OH YES!!!” she screeched, gasping for breath as Colin rammed himself further and further inside her.  <br />
<br />
“FUCK YEAH!” he roared, as he increased the speed of his fuck, ramming himself further and further inside with each stroke, “TAKE IT!”<br />
<br />
Finally, after much bucking and rocking and grasping and kissing, Colin came, his cock buried within her, spurting all the cum that his oversized testicles could produce.  It was so much that it leaked out of Amy, and all over the sheets.</p>
