<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcella Walker&#39;s appearance in Las Vegas was the last thing she wanted. She was also far from stupid and understood a lot of the political circus that had rose up over what was really just a prank gone wrong. She had grown up in Desert Flats just as Christina Moore and up through sixth grade the two had been relatively close. But as Chrissy grew up in a rather decent looking young woman and Marcella remained a bit on the shorter and more heavy side of things, the two began to drift apart. The popular kids flocked to Chrissy and instead of retaining her friendship with Marcella, she tossed Marcella aside and had been surprisingly hurtful toward her. That was betrayal and one that truly hurt Marcella, which made things worse when Chrissy asked Steve Herrons out and he accepted.<br />
<br />
Of course, Steve didn&#39;t know that Marcella liked him, as by the time that Marcella began to develop a crush on him, the split between her and Chrissy had pretty much solidified. And she had driven her actions at Rocky&#39;s club in Desert Flats as a way to get even for all the jokes on her being a &quot;circus freak,&quot; jokes that had been aimed at her from Chrissy and the new friends she made. That was all her actions with the Animalia Virus had been about, and she just wanted to get even. She knew she wasn&#39;t going to be popular and that she probably wasn&#39;t going to drop a lot of weight and be attractive, as her mother and father were also both a bit more rotund than most people. The fact that Horizon had shipped the wrong Animalia Virus shipments to their smaller clinic in Desert Flats had been just a chance occurrence that let gave Marcella the opportunity to get even. She also figured that if anyone got in trouble for it, it would be Rocky and Chrissy, though a lot of that then depended on Marcella not getting spotted and then into a fight with Chrissy while the Animalia Virus in Chrissy&#39;s system was still infectious.<br />
<br />
The consequences of all that left her in a tougher spot than Chrissy was. For Chrissy was only having to adapt to being an African Elephant Animalian. Marcella had the added issues of dealing with the criminal fallout that came from her actions, and the political storm that followed it. Nearly all of January and now a good chunk of February had been taken up a circus with things being added to the charges and things that Marcella had never planned for.  And much to her surprise, the DA for Animalia, Alexandria &quot;Sandy&quot; Lynx, had even come in to explain elements of the circus and asked specific questions on what Marcella had wanted to do with this. That had been the first real revelation to Marcella that things had spiraled out of control. Particularly as it ended up keeping her in a jail cell in Animalia, as the police station in Desert Flats didn&#39;t have the facilities to house her. She only barely heard about some of the other lawsuits that followed, including Sylvia Rattleton filing certain procedural suits against those running the circus on behalf of Horizon Labs and with tacit support from the Animalia DA&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
Of course, the real hope support through all of this was that she would get some support from her parents. Perhaps not condoning of her actions but at least having some understanding of why she&#39;d done what she&#39;d done and noting that what was done was more a prank than some kind of act of domestic terrorism. After all, her mother had comforted her after every instance in which Chrissy had bullied her, and trying to tell her that things would get better in the future, and had even offered Marcella an internship at the clinic in Desert Flats that got Marcella access to the sorting of the supplies that got Marcella access to the Animalia Virus that she&#39;d used. He father had also given her some comfort in proverbial pats on the back that Chrissy was likely to get her own comeuppance when the real world hit her. He&#39;d even stated that he&#39;d been the proverbial &quot;big man on campus&quot; in his own high school days, but never really got beyond that and was busy working in Desert Flats&#39; salt mines, work that was hard and dirty, and had been a part why her mother had left the mine&#39;s emergency medical crew to work at the Horizon Light clinic that Horizon built in Desert Flats. None of that happened...<br />
<br />
The whole political circus had gotten started when her parents finally came to the Animalia jail earlier in February. There Marcella learned on just how far her actions had gone. Her mom had lost her job with Horizon Light for being unable to secure the Animalia Virus and thus allowing Marcella&#39;s theft of it, something she&#39;d never considered. It added to a lot of Marcella&#39;s feelings of guilt that came out after she ended up an Elephant Animalian too and then arrested by the Rhino Guard. She wanted to apologize, as many of these sorts of things just had her angry and flailing, and she&#39;d hoped that her parents would give her some understanding. But her mother didn&#39;t speak and her father all but repeated the political circus&#39; talking points against her... claiming that he wouldn&#39;t be allowed to guard her, which she knew. He was an employee in the Desert Flats Salt Mine and was not involved in the criminal justice system. Why he made that statement, Marcella didn&#39;t know, but it also informed her that she&#39;d lost everything. The last people that had been in her corner before the New Years Eve incident had turned on her and pretty much disowned her.<br />
<br />
The disowning was then confirmed after the political circus&#39; main efforts in the prosecution had failed and Marcella was released on bail. There she was told by her attorney that she had been disowned and that while she was eighteen, without a diploma and with the trial still pending, she would need to be in someone else&#39;s custody. From there, she was sent to live with a Manfred Tuscan and his wife, both of whom were Wooly Mammoth Animalians. They made it clear that what she had done to Chrissy was wrong, regardless of how much of a witch that Chrissy had become when she became popular, and in the wake of everything else, Marcella had admitted as much to them. She also stated that she never intended for things to end up as chaotic as they did and that she wasn&#39;t thinking beyond being jealous or outraged. Both Mammoth Animalians accepted that and were willing to house her while she was on bail, and things would then relate to what would happen regarding the trial and the sentence that would come from it. Marcella still wasn&#39;t sure on what the final charges would be or what the punishments would be. Thankfully, Manfred was willing to drive Marcella to Las Vegas and the trial that she was now being led into.<br />
<br />
She looked through the gallery of those that were present. Her parents were there, though neither looked to her. Chrissy was there with her parents. Though neither Chrissy nor Marcella could bring themselves to actually look at each other beyond a passing glance. She also noted line of attorneys hovering around the prosecutor&#39;s desk, though one balding man seemed to be looking bitterly toward Alexandria &quot;Sandy&quot; Lynx, who was straightening her paperwork and a briefcase on that desk. There were then others that were present, but Marcella figured most of them were news people, as given Animalia&#39;s reputation, the fight between her and Chrissy stood out for crimes involving Animalians, even if Marcella was still Human when all the crimes were committed. It was big news and that was always going to draw attention. Chrissy&#39;s friends and boyfriend probably wouldn&#39;t be able to make the trip as the school wouldn&#39;t have the room for them. Her trunk hung low, and she followed after her attorney while Manfred moved to stand at the back of the gallery. Which actually put him close to Chrissy and another African Elephant Animalian that Marcella had only briefly met before she was transferred from Desert Flats to Animalia, Nzinga.<br />
<br />
&quot;All rise,&quot; came an announcement from a uniformed officer as the door behind the area where the judge&#39;s seat was. There was a clattering of chairs that came with the judge&#39;s entrance while his name as announced by the officer of the court that was covering things. Once the judge sat down, the people that were there also sat down. Marcella settled onto her knees at the defendant&#39;s desk. The judge meanwhile looked to the prosecutor&#39;s table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of this may be a bit atypical, but much of the nature of this case strikes me as atypical, so we will go with it,&quot; the judge spoke, &quot;with there being changes in the charges, changes in the jurisdiction, and all sorts of preliminary hearings on what is to be admissible on the altered charges, including cases that ended up going rapidly to the Federal court system, all for, what was reported to be, a relatively minor infraction and ruckus in northern Nevada.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is understood your honor,&quot; Alexandria Lynx spoke for the prosecution with a slow nod, &quot;and trust me when I say that the original charges and filings would have preferred this case to remain in either Lyre, Animalia, or Desert Flats, the areas that would be the most jurisdictionally proper to the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcella watched as the uplifted Bobcat Animalian, who had taken a surname, despite being single, straightened her dark grey suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you care to explain why the charges were changed and a venue change was made to Las Vegas?&quot; the judge asked, &quot;particularly when there was nothing in the submitted police reports or witness statements that would actually require either?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those were decisions made by the Washoe County DA, your honor,&quot; Alexandria Lynx answered, &quot;decisions that I and the local prosecutor for Desert Flats did not agree with.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Alexandria Lynx stepped to a side while the more rotund man stepped forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your honor, the actions in the incident in question caused intense fear and startlement, both on the part of the victim and those witnesses to the incident in question,&quot; the Washoe County DA spoke, &quot;that was caused by the use of the Animalia Virus, and from reports was used with the intent to transform at least Christina Moore. That counts as domestic terrorism and needs to stand as a point of deterrence to criminal activity. Particularly when Animalia&#39;s &quot;four punishments&quot; have FAILED IN EVERY MEASURE OF JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY. The point of punishment is to DETER crime. All the Animalians and their Socialism do is coddle criminals. Need I remind the court that unlike this county, which voted for the present President 49 to 40%, Animalia voted 51 to 20 in favor of the former Vice President with the Libertarians taking the remaining 29%. Showing that Animalia SUPPORTS criminals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet there was no statement issued by the defendant prior to the incident that was intended to spread fear, there was no statement of that sort on any social media site or sent to any publication,&quot; the judge spoke in a calm tone, &quot;which, when combined with your present statement, under judicial record before this court, would strike me that my suspicions on this case were correct. That it is nothing more than a circus to suit an audience of one and cares nothing for even the people of this state, let alone the people actually involved in the incident in question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your honor...&quot; the Washoe County DA began.<br />
<br />
&quot;I voted for the present President, sir, but I did not do so to punish Animalia,&quot; the judge cut him off, &quot;and I would remind the present audience that the present President IS a convicted FELON. So, I will not tolerate further political theatrics in my court. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your honor...&quot; the Washoe County DA continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;DO... YOU... UNDERSTAND?&quot; the Judge spoke again loudly and slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your honor,&quot; the Washoe County DA backed down.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for that, this court also finds your county office in wasting my time and the time of the prosecutors in your county, that in pure theory, you should be working with,&quot; the Judge spoke, &quot;Now, I may not have the jurisdiction to do anything about your law license, but I would suggest you look more to justice and not political show trials if you wish to hold your office past the next elections for DA in 3 years&#39; time in your county. Particularly as the people of Reno and Lyre/Animalia may turn hard against you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Washoe County DA backed down and looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Ms. Lynx,&quot; the judge spoke, bringing Alexandria Lynx back to the prosecutor&#39;s desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your honor,&quot; Alexandria Lynx spoke as she stepped forward, her short white tipped tail twitching nervously behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;While we thank you for your appeals and stances in this case regarding the crime&#39;s actual evidence,&quot; the judge spoke, &quot;I would also counter that some of the side notes on the nature of the punishment to be taken and other matters were also irrelevant to the case. Had this case remained in Desert Flats or Animalia, while Animalia&#39;s &quot;four punishment&quot; system would certainly be on the table, that would still be an OPTION for that judge to consider. And one that could have been overruled in favor of another punishment, particularly given the fact that the club in question was in Desert Flats, not Animalia. As such, I do not need to be talked down to by anyone, and that includes you. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your honor,&quot; Alexandria Lynx answered, &quot;I... I just reacted to the actions that were taken to try and expand the trial and turn it into something there was no evidence for. I apologize for any and all loss of temper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Ms. Lynx,&quot; the judge nodded, &quot;and with that matter settled, se can move to the actual crimes that the defended, Marcella Walker is charged with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your honor,&quot; Alexandria Lynx spoke, &quot;the present case is a sad one... one brought out of petty jealousy and leading to the deliberate theft of the Animalia Virus, specifically an African Elephant strain of that virus. There was also the intent to use that dose with the hopes of acting on that petty jealousy and thus robbing Christina Moore of her right to choose on whether or not to be an Animalian or to be Human on her own. This then turns fight that inflicted physical damages to the community center/dance hall in Desert Flats once the defendant, Marcella Walker became an Animalian and fought with Christina Moore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcella listened as Alexandria Lynx continued and noted that the charges were largely limited to the theft of the Animalia Virus and the illegal distribution of it. She wasn&#39;t sure on the levels that they reached as the Animalia prosecutor went on, but she was certain that it was much lower than the sorts of charges that had been talked about while the political circus around her case had raised. This then included the property damage that been assessed by Frank to his club. Marcella noted that it was also stated that this property damage was placed on both her and Chrissy, though Chrissy had faced no prosecution on that line of action. It was, however, closer to the sort of thing that Marcella had found herself more than willing to admit guilt to. It was going to be hard to avoid the guilt she felt, and her initial anger still played out of her feelings of betrayal and some of the new Elephant instincts that she&#39;d gained, that seemed to see Chrissy as either part of another herd or as a rival for &quot;matriarch&quot; within a herd, was now burned away. Being disowned by her parents was the final straw in that and it left her broken. She didn&#39;t want to fight anymore.<br />
<br />
It was only when she felt a poke at her elbow that Marcella actually responded. She looked over and down to her attorney, a Human who looked remarkably tiny compared to the buxom and muscular Elephant Animalian she&#39;d become. He pointed up to the judge.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, your honor,&quot; Marcella managed and trying to think how to answer the man&#39;s stern face, &quot;I was just thinking...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust it relates to your plea to the charges that Ms. Lynx has laid out?&quot; the judge asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Marcella answered, &quot;and based on those charges... I would plead guilty. Christina Moore and I were friends... and... I did get insanely jealous when she got popular, and I didn&#39;t. And I let her bullying get to me... and that lead to stupid mistakes. I never meant for anyone to be frightened, and I never intended for anyone but Chrissy to become an Animalian. It was a case of not thinking... and I can&#39;t say I have an excuse. I will take whatever sentence you see fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; the judge said slowly, &quot;well, with the guilty plea going along with other circumstances that have related to the circus around this case. The starting punishment would be one month and two weeks incarceration and noted as time served. Given that you were not released on bail until a week or so ago, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was around Valentines Day, but, yes,&quot; Marcella answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The remainder of your punishment will be subject to the Animalia police department and their four-punishment system,&quot; the judge spoke, &quot;you will also be remanded to the custody of Manfred Tuscan and his wife while you finish schooling, cover all of the four-punishments assigned.&quot; The judge paused to look to Alexandria Lynx, &quot;which I will expect written reports on Ms. Walkers&#39; response to each. Keep the reports as PG as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your honor,&quot; Alexandria Lynx answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will also be expected to carry out community service to cover the damages caused in the fight in the New Years Eve fight,&quot; the judge then resumed his sentencing of Marcella, &quot;and to attend 100 hours of therapy to work on issues of temper, jealousy, and other perceived issues that were reported to the court. You may handle these in sequential and coordination with the law enforcement agencies in Animalia, and officers will monitor your actions going forward. Do you understand, Ms. Walker.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Marcella said as she looked down again and then noted the judge&#39;s look, and finished, &quot;your honor.&quot;</p>
