<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dammit, Alec thought as he looked back at the radio just after turning it off, that was not a smart move. How had he just drifted like that from the kind of music he liked into that...THAT kind of music. It was like he&#39;d just naturally went from his usual material over to rap. Alec rubbed his face and looked at the window, seeing his face in it and shaking his head. &quot;I&#39;m...not like this. I&#39;m white. I know I am. Cmon, don&#39;t do this to me...&quot; He didn&#39;t know how he could show up to school going forward looking like this. Least of all with his friends in mind. They wouldn&#39;t exactly give him a warm welcome, looking and sounding like he was now.<br />
<br />
The fact they would treat him so differently almost provoked some kind of a eureka moment in Alec, one which was quashed when he found himself looking at his reflection again. Alec did admit that even with his skin color having changed as much as it did, his muscles did look really impressive. He flexed an arm and was downright pleased by the cannonball bicep he saw bulge up. He did some brief flexing for himself, testing to see if he still looked as good...<br />
<br />
...And speaking of bulges...<br />
<br />
Alec looked down at his pants line and sighed. His manhood was achingly erect, and its newly more pornographic size was a problematic sight for him, pushing up as if his boxers and jeans were nothing to it. Alec looked around and decided he still had his needs. Much as it would ashame him to have to deal with himself like...like this. He sighed and slowly removed his tank top, followed by his jeans.<br />
<br />
Standing there naked, Alec walked passed the bathroom and found himself looking at his distinctly ethnic body on his way over to go take care of himself. It was remarkably like his body just hours ago, but if anything the mixed race appearance seemed to enhance his muscled appearance. Everything seemed to stand out more. He shook his head and said, &quot;...Can&#39;t wait to get this fixed up. Get back to normal!&quot;<br />
<br />
He awkwardly smiled as he kept walking, as if he was trying to convince himself of that even as he realized how he looked now. He was like a bodybuilder who did porn. He just looked GOOD. But it...it wasn&#39;t him. Alec shook his head and decided to go ahead and just go take care of his...need.<br />
<br />
As Alec booted up his laptop and plopped down on his bed, he found himself looking at his body up close and personal. His hands drifted from his laptop to feeling up his new body. He felt with nervous hands the body that seemed so alien to him, and he let out a low moan as his hand touched his right nipple, and moaned louder when that same hand cupped his balls. Alec pushed his glutes into his bed and thrust his hips once, seeing his now rock hard erection.<br />
<br />
Once the laptop was on, Lloyd went to his favorite porn site straightaway, and found his libido was on fire far more than normal.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was the changes that had happened to him so far making his testosterone production go through the roof, but Alec could hardly stop himself even just as the porn flick started. His hand had to be pulled back from his groin several times as he wondered if this was really how these kinds of guys experienced it...or if it was just how buff and riven with test he was right now. Alec wiped off his face again, realizing another thing, that it seemed that he was sweating like fuck during this.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so buff, baby...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I workout so you can love my muscles, baby~&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec finally let himself start feeling up his cock and balls more freely, groaning as he watched this, riveted. He did admit that as muscular and handsome as the young guy in the porn vid was, Alec was easily so much more muscular than him. Alec bet he would be able to do the job just as well if not outright better than that dude. Heh, Alec thought, I&#39;m eighteen, why don&#39;t I try doing some porn?<br />
<br />
That idea never really occurred to him before, it was always something he saw others do but he never thought of doing it himself. Mostly because he considered himself more &quot;moral&quot; than doing that kind of thing. But now, as he indulged in his need, he was starting to wonder about how it felt. Maybe he&#39;d like to give it a try!<br />
<br />
Not like the people who&#39;d see it would be able to tell it was Alec in the video. They&#39;d just see some big, buff mixed race dude having the best sex of his fucking life... Alec was thrusting away into his tight, calloused hand, moaning and kicking one leg as he enjoyed his sexuality. He was gonna turn back to normal anyway, so why not have some fun while he was like this? After all, he&#39;d be getting paid too. Gettin&#39; paid to get laid, sounded like the life!<br />
<br />
Alec watched with widened eyes as the woman in the video took the dude&#39;s whole dick in her mouth and drew out his passion, whispering, &quot;Aww shawty takin&#39; that dick in her mouth, yo that&#39;s the hottest...&quot; Alec didn&#39;t talk like that, Alec never talked like that. But he just figured it was the video - all the video. The muscular athlete was riding the waves of attraction and arousal - he could hardly stop himself from going over the edge...<br />
<br />
His hand tightened on his thick, long cock, and his other rubbed and felt up his balls, which seemed to be more sensitive now than ever before. Muscles tightened, his sphincter clenched and his nipples stiffened... And then Alec was due to hit his orgasm. An astonishing explosion of pleasure blasted through his mind as Alec tried one final time to draw out his pleasure, &quot;Aww fuck, here it comes yo, dammit!!&quot;<br />
<br />
And then Alec was cumming, and it was beyond anything the white boy had ever experienced.<br />
<br />
It was at once so intense and full of pleasure that he couldn&#39;t keep coherent throughout it. His body thrashed a few more times as his cock sprayed, nutting all over himself and the side of his bed on the floor. Alec shook a few times as he laid there on his bed, the porno flick continuing to run on his bed even as he kicked a few more times with one leg, his breath harsh and shaky. His moans were lighter and more sexualized. Each and every movement was in tune with a pleased tingle from his dick.<br />
<br />
And then he started to come down from this high induced by one of the best orgasms ever. Alec shook his head and got up, holding himself up as he almost fell via his muscular, strong arms. Alec didn&#39;t know what to do from here, but damn that was the best fucking cum ever...</p>
