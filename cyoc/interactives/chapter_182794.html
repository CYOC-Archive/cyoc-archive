<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“A…A Succubus?” said Nate in her new voice which sounded like bottled sex, she was still trying to cover herself since her pants where now both too big and where ripped apart from behind due to the growth of her new forked tail. She was holding them up with one hand while the other was trying to cover her very large breasts, her shirt was almost totally destroyed thanks to the pair of large bat like wings which grew from her shoulder blade. <br />
<br />
“Yes…don’t worry Nate we will change you back.” Announced Jamie as she hoped her Aunts could, they sounded like there was going to be a problem, but she wasn’t sure what it could be. <br />
<br />
“Lets first get you dressed.” Countered Nancy as she raised one of her hands up toward Nate, palm out while the other hand began to rapidly move, a small line of greenish/blue energy shot from her moving hand up to the still hand and then forward striking Nate. The greenish blue energy clashed with her new red skin but the energy focused on the remains of the cloths. <br />
<br />
The jeans Nate had been wearing shrank a bit and tightened over her long sexy legs and around her hips, a fly like zipper and button in the back gave freedom for the tail. It also made her prefect heart shaped ass even better looking. While she could not see it, Nate’s boxers also changed into briefs. Her tennis shoes had not taken much damage, it any but they shrank along with her socks to fit her smaller feet.<br />
The top was a bigger issue, the wings made T-shirts a problem. Her white t-shirt which was hanging on by a thread began to shift and move around, a pair of thin straps moved up and over the shoulders before meeting in the back and going straight back down between the wings. With that done a rather tight white top which showed off her tone and sexy mid driffed formed, along with a simple sports bra which gave no actually support, a succubus had muscles which made a natural bra but it did help hide her rather noticeable nipples. <br />
<br />
“There now we can talk without you having to cover yourself.” Said Beatrice <br />
<br />
“My God….” Said Nate as she looked at herself, it was both horrifying and amazing. He had become a wet dream, he would have wanted to fuck himself if he had seen himself when he was a man. She looked up at the three witches and more so to his friend Jamie. He had always had a slight crush on her, hard not to considering how close they where but both agreed not to attempt anything more then friendship, now she was imagining doing a lot more then just kissing her. <br />
<br />
“She will be fun, very fun, even by herself maybe if I can talk her boyfriend in to joining us, he has a good size member.” Thought Nate to herself in a sexy female voice as she remembered being in the locker room with Jamie’s boyfriend in high school. “More so if we can get my ex in as well, a four way may just satisfy me…for a while at least.”<br />
<br />
Nate grabbed his head, feeling her horns as he looked up again.<br />
<br />
“My head hurts and I…” started Nate wondering how to say she was fantasying about a four way orgy with her best friend. <br />
<br />
“You are thinking of a way to sleep with one of us, likely our niece.” Said Nancy as she moved her hand in a rapid rate.<br />
<br />
“You’re a succubus, a sex demon you feed on sex, you are sex given form and you need sex to live.” Added Beatrice “Not daily sex, but at least 3 or 4 times a week, and your body is trying to get it and helps.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” inquired Jamie, she hadn’t wanted to admit it but she was turned on by her friend and was trying not to show it.<br />
<br />
“Like a mare in heat she is releasing powerful scents in the air to draw in her prey.” Explained Nancy as with one final movement, three glowing masks appeared around the nose and mouth of the witches. “This should protect us from that, but in time she will be able to control and focus it, right now it is just a general area.”<br />
<br />
“In time, you aren’t going to change me back?” inquired Nate as he tried not to moan a bit, one of his hands hand brushed her breast and her nipples where very hard and very sensitive.<br />
<br />
“Magic doesn’t work like that, we can’t just snap our fingers and turn you totally back to normal, it has it’s limits.” Stated Beatrice <br />
<br />
“You had turned into just a creature but stayed male, we could turn you back with no real difficulty, but since you became a woman, it adds complexity to the spell.” Explained Nancy “We could turn you back into a human right now, but you would remain a woman, likely forever. Spells can’t do everything at once and stacking spells on top of spells is asking for trouble. We can only work with what we have<br />
<br />
“Take your cloths, I didn’t change their colors or add a much of stuff, I worked with what I had to modify it.” Added Beatrice “We can change you into a human or back into a man, not both.”<br />
<br />
“But the shard did both?” countered Jamie <br />
<br />
“The shard is ancient powerful magic which we don’t fully understand.” Stated Nancy<br />
<br />
“Basically, you have 4 options.” added Nancy as she looked at Nate and began to tick the options off on her fingers.<br />
<br />
“1, you can turn back into a human right away. Doing so will make your woman forever and from there we can work to modify people’s memory of you to make them always believe you where a woman.” <br />
<br />
“2, we can change you back into a man, you would be an Incubus. That is a male Succubus, and you will likely forever be an Incubus. We can give you a spell to make people see you as you were but that would be an illusion.” <br />
<br />
“3, you can stay as you are and give us some time to research and find a way to transform you back into a human man. We can give you a similar illusion spell to make people see you as a woman and you will have to live as woman/succubus for as long as it takes for us to find a way to turn you back.”<br />
<br />
There was a long pause as Nate and Jaime waited to hear what the 4th option was.<br />
<br />
“the 4th way is the quickest but most dangerous, we can attempt to transform you back into a male and a human right away with no research and there is a chance it could work. However, there is a large chance of magical backfire which could turn you into a human women forever, an Incubus forever or something we couldn’t imagine. Magical backfire is something to be avoided.”<br />
<br />
“So Nate what do you want to do?” inquired Jaime<br />
<br />
“I want to….” Started Nate as she considered.</p>
