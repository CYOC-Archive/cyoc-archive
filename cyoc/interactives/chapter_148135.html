<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty decided that he was ready to join in the fun.  He wished himself out of the room at the door, and all of a sudden he was there, no longer invisible.  Ty wished Dustin&#39;s friends trusted, respected, and feared him as much as they had Dustin, no, more than they had Dustin.  Ty waited nervously outside the door.  While so far everything he had wished had come true, this was a big risk, if his power failed him they would probably beat him up. Ty caught his breath and opened the door, all four boys stopped what they were doing and looked at Ty.  Ty stood frozen every ounce of him screaming run, sure he had made a mistake, before Charlie said, &quot;Oh hey Ty, hope we didn&#39;t bother you&quot; averting his gaze to the floor.  The others followed quickly after.  For a moment Ty didn&#39;t know how to react, normally it was him who was afraid to look them in the eyes, then after what seemed like an eternal silence, Ty gather his courage and said &quot;What are you doing to little Dustin.&quot; <br />
<br />
This immediately made Charlie, Cody, and Jake smile; they craved Ty&#39;s approval.  Jake spoke first, &quot;We&#39;re embarrassing clit dick here,&quot; he said raising Dustin exposing his micro penis.  Charlie was next, his finger still in Dustin&#39;s ass, &quot;would you like to join us?&quot; He asked with hope in his voice.  &quot;Yea, bro&#39;s for sure&quot; Ty said, trying to sound as much like them as I could.  Their faces lit up with joy.  Ty had clearly wished them to a point of subservience to me.  I looked down at the rock hard penises I had given them and smiled.  &quot;Don&#39;t let me hold you back&quot; I said matter of factly pointing at Dustin&#39;s ass, &quot;that looks like it needs some attention.&quot;  Charlie smiled. His newly elongated dick was rock hard and pointing straight off his body as he moved into position behind Dustin.  Dustin knew what was coming and put up a feeble fight, before receiving a smack and a &quot;shut up&quot; from Cody.  Ty watched his boner throbbing for release. <br />
<br />
Charlie pressed his manhood against Dustin&#39;s hole, squirting some of Dustin&#39;s jack off lotion onto the tip of his big dick before forcing it in.  Dustin yelped in pain.  Ty smiled as he watched his step-brother&#39;s ass getting pounded.  Eventually he might make Ty a power bottom so that June and Mark were ashamed of Dustin but for now he was getting off on the pain and shame in his Dustin&#39;s eyes.  Charlie pumped Dustin&#39;s hole for a few more minutes before pulling out and passing it off to Cody.  Ty watched as Cody&#39;s improved big nuts smacked against Dustin&#39;s ass with every in and out of Cody&#39;s dick.  Cody came to the point of coming before he pulled out and letting Jake&#39;s girthy cock in, stretching Dustin&#39;s ass even more than the previous two had.  Dustin was on the verge of tears by this point. Finally Jake turned to Ty, and asked, &quot;would you like a turn?&quot;  Dustin looked over to Ty humiliated, pleading of him to say &quot;no.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty thought about it for just a moment before deciding that he was going to take advantage of this situation. First Ty decided to make a few wishes.  First Ty made all the boys as subservient to him as Dustin was to them.  Second, he was going to need a new penis.  Ty decided that he wanted Dustin&#39;s only cock, but about half again bigger.  He felt it begin to grow as soon as the wish left his mind.  Once the changes stoped, Ty dropped his shorts and underwear.  Ty&#39;s new penis was double digits hard and thicker than a big soup can, with orange size balls resting beneath.  Ty was speechless, finally he felt like a real man, he couldn&#39;t take his eyes off of it.  Dustin&#39;s mouth dropped open. Having seen Ty&#39;s previous pathetic cock, he was very confused by this recent turn of events.  The other boys were equally impressed, complimenting Ty on all aspects of his manhood.  They openly stated their inferiority to him, something that made him rock hard.  &quot;Here you go, sir&quot; Charlie said rotating Dustin&#39;s ass towards Ty&#39;s engorged member.  Dustin was quietly sobbing by now, repeating his insistence that he was actually hung and this was all a weird dream.  <br />
<br />
As Ty moved towards Dustin&#39;s ass, he hesitated for a moment, unsure if he could follow through with his plan.  Charlie took this moment to squirt lube on Ty&#39;s enormous member.  Charlies hands running up and down all 11 inches, spreading lube, felt amazing.  Ty had never had anyone besides him touch his penis, tonight would be a night of many firsts.  Ty approached his step brother&#39;s bent over ass, slowly moving his cock to the now used hole, making contact slowly.  Dustin tensed as Ty carefully lined up his member with the hole before pushing his glistening cock in.   Dustin yelped in pain as Ty forced inch after inch in, before bottoming out at around 8&quot; leaving 3&quot; exposed.  The other boys watched amazed, complementing Ty&#39;s size, girth, and technique. Ty began to pump faster, the pleasure building as his step brother made a mix of pleasure moans and pain squeals before Ty pulled all of his cock out cumming on and into Ty&#39;s exposed ass.  The expertion leaving him feeling spent.  Then Charlie asked, &quot;can I cum now sir?&quot; and Ty, surprised, nodded his head allowing Charlie to repeat the act leave his load in Dustin. Cody and Jake followed suit, each asking Ty&#39;s permission first.</p>
