<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Laying on the floor, Rachel looked at her self in the mirror and smiled contentedly. Never had she imagined that she would feel this sexy. She had masturbated to orgasm three times already and the day was hardly half over. Normally she wouldn't masturbate that many times in a week, let alone in a day, and as warm and flushed as her pussy felt right now, she was ready to do it again. She felt so good that she could easily imagine spending the whole day playing with her belly, breasts and pussy. It was almost frightening and would have been if not for how easy it would be for her to turn back to normal, not that she wanted to. Having d-cup breasts with big, plump nipples practically begging to be played with and dripping with milky fullness was far better than having b-cup breasts like she normally did. Though never having been dissatisfied with the size of her breasts before, she now felt that larger breasts were far more sexy. Her breasts as they had been previously seemed far too small, having been just over a handful, with little nipples hardly larger than a pencil eraser.<br />
<br />
Then there was her belly, so heavy and round. Its weight was comfortable and it felt so right. The thought of getting rid of it made her feel naked and vulnerable. Appearing pregnant made her feel empowered, going back to having a small, flat stomach would mean losing that feeling.<br />
<br />
Of course she couldn't spend the rest of her life like this, not even the rest of the day. Her mom would be coming home in a few hours and she knew if she wasn't back to normal by then her mom would freak out.<br />
<br />
Sighing, she heaved herself into a sitting position, spreading her legs wide to balance her big belly and hefty breasts. She gave her belly one last fond pat and rose to her feet.<br />
<br />
With her hands resting on her belly she went over to her bed where the chocolates waited on her night table. Not yet ready to go back to normal, she spent a moment looking them over, thinking about all the wonderful things she could do to herself with them. That thought cheered her up. Even if she couldn't always be the way she was now at least she could change back any time she wanted, or try something new if she wanted to.<br />
<br />
While looking over the chocolates she noticed that there were some that she had overlooked earlier, specifically dark and white chocolate baby bottles. Having a hunch about what they would do, she took a white chocolate one, figuring that it was the safest way to test her theory and as good a place as any to start with going back to normal.<br />
<br />
Sure enough her hunch proved right, as the chocolate melted in her mouth her breasts began to feel lighter, her lactation slowing. Two more of the chocolates and her breasts were dry, her lactation having ceased entirely.<br />
<br />
Her breasts now felt lighter, which almost made up for the empty feeling that accompanied the lightness. Now that she was no longer producing milk she realized that she missed the warm, full feeling that came with being full of milk. Then again, since they were lighter there was no reason not to have a bit of fun before resuming her return to normal. She did have a few hours after all, and there was no harm in experimenting.<br />
<br />
She took a dark chocolate breast and popped it into her mouth, watching as her already large breasts expanded farther, growing another cup size. They sagged slightly under their weight, but not enough to make them lose their roundness. Another breast chocolate and they grew further, their bottoms coming to rest on her belly, which sent a shudder of pleasure through her. Having the two sensitive areas in contact with each other was the best thing she had felt all day. Unable to help herself she gave one of her nipples a gentle squeeze, exhaling sharply at how good it felt. Her nipples were easily over an inch long now, proportionately thick and sitting proudly erect in the center of her large, dark areolas.<br />
<br />
Having such large breasts and such a big belly would have looked comical on such a slender frame, or so Rachel would have believed previously, but now she thought it made her sexy.<br />
<br />
Deciding to keep her breasts just a bit longer, she ate white chocolate bellies one by one until her stomach was back to normal. It felt so small and empty that she felt sad just looking at herself in the mirror. Resting a hand against its smooth, flat surface was almost too much for her. <br />
<br />
Just for fun, and to postpone the inevitable for that much longer, she got dressed. Of course the bra she had taken from her mom's room was now too small for her breasts and her shirt was stretched so tight that she could clearly see her nipples through it. The sight made her laugh, and on a whim she ate another breast enlarging chocolate, enjoying the way her breasts were squeezed by the too tight shirt. It looked like her breasts would explode out of it at any moment, which made her wonder. Was it possible for her breasts to burst out of the shirt? It was an old and baggy shirt, or at least it had been baggy, so she didn't mind the risk of wrecking it, especially not in an attempt to do something so very sexy.<br />
<br />
She ate another of the breast dark chocolates, the confines of her shirt becoming almost painful, but in a good way. The shirt was skin tight, and when she moved she could practically hear the fabric straining. Another chocolate and it was so tight that it brought tears to her eyes and made her pussy feel flushed with pleasure. <br />
<br />
Her massive nipples were pressed hard against the fabric and she rubbed them gently before continuing with her experiment. Her breasts were easily larger than basketballs by this point and she could see the seams of her shirt starting to break, but she still hadn't burst out of it.<br />
<br />
One more chocolate did it, though the results were not the explosion she had been hoping for. The shirt split down the sides and her breasts spilled out to rest heavily on her stomach. She had no idea how big they were, all she knew was that their weight was almost more than she could handle. Just to see what it would be like she stood up, her breasts bouncing and swaying as she did. <br />
<br />
Looking at her beach ball sized breasts in the mirror she realized that it wasn't just looking pregnant that had made her feel sexy, as she found that having such large breasts was just as attractive as looking pregnant, rather it was looking so different than normal that she liked. The way she had looked before, with small breasts and a flat stomach had been boring, but this was amazing. If she had been uncertain how her boyfriend would respond to her having a pregnant looking belly and lactating, she was sure how he would react to the inhuman endowments she possessed now. He would love her huge breasts and would be thrilled to fondle them and suck on her nipples, which were now at least an inch and a half long, perfect for being played with.<br />
<br />
Walking slowly around her room, she savored the way her breasts looked and moved, before getting down to business.<br />
<br />
Quickly, not wanting to think too much about what she was doing, she ate breast reducing chocolates until she was back down to a c-cup. She then cleaned up, throwing out her ruined shirt and returning her mother's bra.<br />
<br />
She would have been depressed if not for something she had noticed while looking at the chocolates earlier, which had given her the start of a plan. There were dark and white chocolate birthday cakes, and she was certain that she knew what they would do. The dark chocolate cakes would make a person older, the white chocolate ones would make you younger. Rachel was sure that if she got her mom to try a few white chocolate cakes and discovered what they did that her mom would be more open to the other chocolates. With luck it wouldn't take much effort to convince her that it was fine to experiment with the chocolates. If that worked she would be able to use the chocolates when she was home even when her mom was around. If things went really well she might even be able to convince her mom to let her keep a few changed permanently.</p>
