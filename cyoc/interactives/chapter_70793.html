<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh walked up to a door she never seen in the Mark's house knowing it was her room now. Lizzie's room. As Josh reached up to the door handle she noticed it's eye-level with her. Josh knew that usually the door handles were fitted about 3 feet above the floor and so by simple maths she reckoned she couldn't be taller than 3'3''.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really hope I'll grow...&quot; she thought. Josh dismissed the tiny voice in her head saying that the growth comes with puberty and puberty brings... all the stuff Josh didn't want to face about the next three hours. Well, less than three hours now.<br />
<br />
Josh wondered what would she see behind the door. She sort of expected the stereotypical little girl's pink but also something told her it wouldn't be the case. And it weren't.<br />
<br />
Josh pushed the door, so heavy for her in this tiny body, and she saw a nice room all in pastel shades of blue and pink. The pink weren't aggressive like in most of the girls' toys Josh remembered. It was more of this calm, graceful sort of pink. Something perfectly suitable for the females of this world as Josh had wished them earlier to be.<br />
<br />
Also all the furniture was probably a ted smaller in this room as Josh somewhat felt a little bit less of a midget. The ceiling still seemed to be as high as the sky.<br />
<br />
Josh didn't even notice one of the reflexes than came with her new body - as soon as she entered the room she delicately slid of her maryjanes and proceeded to walk around gently tip-toeing, somewhere at the back of her head enjoying the feeling of the fluffy carpet under her delicate feet.<br />
<br />
She walked like that to the bed and climbed on it. On the nightstand she saw a framed picture. She took it; it felt heavy in her small hands. On the picture there was Mark's dad and his mom in her new form Josh was still not used to. In between them there was a cute girl trying to blow candles on a cake with a big '10' on it. The red mane of hair she possessed made her look a little bit like a petite version of the girl from the Pixar's new movie Brave with Angelina Jolie's lips.<br />
<br />
Josh investigated the picture for a couple seconds and then her gaze swept the room again this time settling on a mirror placed on the wall in front of the bed she was sitting on. In the mirror she could see the same girl as there was on the picture save for her bright green eyes which now were red from recent crying. She slowly put the picture down and...<br />
<br />
Against all reason Josh felt her eyes starting to water again, her 10 year old body's hormones taking over again. Soon she was laying down, her face down the pillow, crying her eyes out. Even though she really wanted to reason herself out of it, Josh's child brain refused to think coherently as she cried, now just for crying's and sadness' sake... A quiet &quot;I don't want...&quot; or &quot;I can't...&quot; escaped her lips every now and then.<br />
<br />
Josh didn't know how long she'd spent like that. Trying to stop crying seemed to only make it worse so soon she gave up on that. Eventually the flood of emotions seemed to let go, like a tide going low, and Josh just laid there, her face still pressed into the pillow. She realized, however, something felt off...<br />
<br />
Josh thought it was weird that she felt as... somehow... more of her skin was touching the fabric of her dress..? That maybe it felt less loose than before..? Cut differently? She couldn't really tell. And there was this strange feeling in her chest. In two points there actually... Something like a cross between the mosquito bit itch and soreness of a swollen gums accompanying a toothache.<br />
<br />
She sat up and eyed her dress which was definitely not the one she started crying with. This one was plain and light green which even for Josh's boy mind looked nice with Lizzie's ginger hair scattered all over the bed. This dress though, unlike the last one was smooth and hugged her torso tightly making Josh realize for the first time how slender she was in the waist. The waist which ever so slightly contrasted with...<br />
<br />
Josh gasped in her soft girly voice. For her whole life as a boy Josh always remembered his torso was pretty much the same width on all it's length. He often wished he had broader shoulders but it seemed that being in a great masculine shape wasn't something Mother Nature intended for him.<br />
<br />
Now Josh had something wider - her hips. They weren't wider by much, only 2 or 3 inches, but Josh realized that was just the first step towards possessing hips intended for childbirth.<br />
<br />
&quot;And my fantasy realized certainly won't make them any narrower&quot; she thought remembering the way she described the perfection of femininity to Mark earlier that day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch! No, seriously?&quot; Josh said, now aloud, bringing her hand to her chest. She felt the perfect flatness of it she was used to now somehow disturbed...<br />
<br />
There wasn't any sharp pain, just a dull ache in what, Josh now knew, were her developing breasts. 'Annoying' was one way to put it, 'uncomfortable' being the other. She scratched her chest trough the fabric of her dress and that seemed to make things only worse as Josh felt slight throbbing now clearly centered in her nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, God... Please not this...&quot; she whispered but she knew that this was inevitable given Mark's wish to advance her in age. Curiosity was too strong and Josh pulled away the top of her dress slightly to take a look at her bare chest.<br />
<br />
A couple of blue veins showing trough her pale and freckled skin appeared on her chest leading to clearly swollen nipples. They and the areolas were dark pink and very puffy, little cones of probably about 1 inch height. The aerolae's diameter almost matched Josh's index finger length. Their soreness felt a little bit like if there was pressure under them, waiting to be released.<br />
<br />
Josh grimaced thinking of how uncomfortable that soreness made her feel and rubbed the nipples with the back of her palm. Immediately she realized that was a bad idea - if she didn't want to go insane with their dull ache she better leave them alone.<br />
<br />
Josh remembered how her younger sister, Zoe, one time talked to their mom about how itchy her nipples feel but Josh never imagined it was as bad as this.<br />
&quot;Or maybe it wasn't as bad as this?&quot; she thought. &quot;Maybe it's because of Mark's wish for all women to lactate permanently? Maybe there's simply a need for much more milk tissue and it needs to grow fast during puberty?.. I don't know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How old am I anyway?&quot; she thought looking around her room for any clues. The room didn't change at all. Even the dollhouse was still where she's seen it standing before. The answer came from the nightstand. The same frame she looked at before now hosted a different picture. It was almost all the same, but the red-haired girl looked visibly older and the cake had a big '12' on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Josh said in his soft voice. &quot;I'm supposed to age 1 year per half hour and I managed to get 12 already... That means I cried for about an hour! Unbelievable!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh wanted to jump off the bed and see if Mark's mom has any recollection of Lizzie being 10 and all sad just an hour ago but she felt something in her lower abdomen. Some usually tensed muscles let go and then she felt wetness in between her legs. Josh just peed herself. Probably just like every other female in the neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Apparently Mark was having fun out in the town...</p>
