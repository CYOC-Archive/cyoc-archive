<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris weighed his options; he didn’t want to become a vampire in a few minutes like the doctor said would happen if he took the fast option. He wanted to spend as much being himself as possible, but he knew sitting around fearing what change could happen next would drive him crazy and he wouldn’t enjoy his last couple of days of being “human”.<br />
<br />
“Fast.” Answered Chris as the Doctor nodded.<br />
<br />
Turns out fast wasn’t fast, there was a small mountain of paperwork and then the doctors did a full medical check and took samples of everything, hair, blood and even semen.<br />
<br />
“Are we ready?” inquired Chris as a nurse took away a cup he had filled. “What is the point of all this?”<br />
<br />
“Well, we are hoping to find a cure to this thing and who knows what we will need to bring people back to normal.” Explained the Doctor as Chris was led to one last room, he was no longer wearing his normal cloths instead a simple hospital gown. A large table was set up with an IV drip ready along with another medical drip. <br />
<br />
“So it is time?” inquired Chris<br />
<br />
“It is.” Confirmed the Doctor “Please lay down.”<br />
<br />
Chris did, he worried for a moment if the table would take his weight, he was built like a tank and he had always had a Dad body. He had looked on embarrassed at the scale when he got on earlier, his one back home was off by a good 15 pounds, but the table took his weight with ease.<br />
<br />
He lied down and was surprise to see a full body mirror which gave him a good look at himself, a 30 year old man with for the lack of a better term a dad’s body or possible a beer belly. Normal brown hair and brown, green eyes, a short beard and the like. The only thing that made him stand out was his height he was just over 6’2 which was nice. He wore a white medical gown which stopped around his knees and let everyone see his thick hairy legs, lucky it they couldn’t see how thick the hair on his chest was.<br />
<br />
“Just relax.” Said the nurse, she looked like a sort of goat human hybrid as two medical drips went into his arm. One was a clear fluid the other a golden red color, that one was the drug to make him a monster…a vampire.<br />
<br />
“Do it.” Ordered Chris as the sound of his heartbeat came through the arm as a heart monitor was turned on. Then with a flick the line was open, and the red gold liquid went down the line and entered his arm. He tensed for a bit as his heart rate jumped.<br />
<br />
“Relax.” Said the nurse again. Chris tried to keep his breathing normal. For a long time, nothing seemed to happen, 1 minute turned to 2 and then to 5. It was some time between the five- and ten-minute mark that the first changes began to happen. <br />
<br />
This short brown hair began to gray and then rapidly turn to a pure snow like white with some spots of metallic looking silver mixed in …that was strange but livable. Then his skin began to pale, it did not become ashen white like he expected or even snow white, instead it turned from a normal white to a white which looked like it would burn in the sun in minutes…which to be fair it would. <br />
<br />
“We should be about a quarter of the way done.” Announced the Nurse as Chris began to cough a bit, his lips lost their color turning a much duller shade of pink, as he coughed four teeth loosened and then with a turn of his head, he coughed them out. In their place two pairs of fangs an upper pair and a lower pair began to grow in and lengthened. He opened his mouth to let him see them in the mirror, the upper set was longer than the lower one, to the point he wouldn’t have been surprised if they poked out when he smiled. His eyes shifted color, he expected them to become red….it was always red eyes for Vampires was not it. That is what the Doctor had said.<br />
<br />
Instead, his eyes shifted from a brown green to the opposite of red, a deep almost glowing blue. It was unnatural to look at them but with the white hair on top of his head and the pale skin, the blue eyes really popped out. <br />
<br />
“Maybe I am becoming an Ice Vampire?” laughed Chris to lighten the mood<br />
<br />
“Maybe, but we have had a green-eyed vampire a while ago, eye color doesn’t mean much.” Announced the Nurse as she looked at the timer “Well you’re about half way done, this is when the major changes normally happen.”<br />
<br />
That caused Chris to look at himself in much more detail, that is when he noticed the dark hair on his legs had fallen off and no lied on the table. His beard was falling away in clumps and while he couldn’t see it he guessed his chest hair was also falling off him. <br />
<br />
His heart began to pound as he looked at the mirror, his face began to shift, the jaw line began to soften the rest of his facial features softened as well, he had seen this face before at least something much like it. It looked like an older version of his younger sister, that is when his heart rate really shot up. <br />
<br />
Then with a snap, his broad shoulders shot inwards, and his bones began to shrink along with his body. His sister like his mother was short and lack of a better term squat. He had gotten his height from his father, who was tall and lean like a whip, he had gotten the height but the heavier frame from his mom. He began to shrink, his arms remained slightly longer as they thinned out same with legs.<br />
<br />
“No….no….no.” cried Chris his voice much higher.<br />
<br />
“It is alright.” Said the nurse as Chris looked at himself and was sickened, he had to shorter than his sister or his mother and they were below 5’6 and yet he had to remain over 300 pounds. But as he looked all that weight had to be in his chest and upper leg area, his arms, head and lower legs where impossibly thin. <br />
<br />
Then like someone had turned on a heater the fat weight began to melt away, he must have dropped at least 200 pounds in the span of 2 minutes. Until he was as thin as his father, if not thinner. <br />
<br />
That is when it happened a punch in his groan which hurt like hell as he felt his manhood shrink and shrink before going into his body. <br />
She let out the first scream of her life as he became a she. She was breathing heavily; her mouth was dry and her body was covered with sticky sweat like she had run a marathon something Chris would never do. <br />
<br />
She had a moment to catch her breath as her hair began to grow out, the white mixed in with a few pieces of metallic looking silver as it grew longer and longer. It did not become a beautiful set of flowing hair, the hair had grown so fast and unevenly that knots and kinks where clearly visible.<br />
<br />
“They will take care of that after that, we will get you settled once the changes are done.” Reassured the nurse as Chris wondered what could be left to happen to him…well her. Then he looked down, she was still flat chested and if there was anything he knew about Vampires in pop culture they where busty women with largest breasts then what was natural on a normal body. What did not help was that his mother and sister where both curvy women and while he well now she was much thinner then either of them he was still expected a pair of at least D cups to come in. <br />
<br />
To his amazement as his breasts pushed out, they where not Ds not even Cs…his best guess where B cups at best maybe even large A cups. They where not the massive breasts he expected to see on a Vampire. He…She? Still looked to be in her late 20’s or 30’s but this short, thin vampire who looked like she would have been a ballerina, or a gymnast was very different then the broad shoulder, giant linemen who had been there only 15 minutes before or even the busty vampires he had seen on TV and movies.<br />
<br />
“Well your done.” announced the Nurse “Lets get you to post transformations, they will short you out and get you settled in a room.”</p>
