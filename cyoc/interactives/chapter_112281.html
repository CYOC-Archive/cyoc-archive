<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Authors note: The chapter of this title is a line for the song &quot;Mad World&quot; - The version sung by Gary Jules<br />
<br />
“Cousin Frieda,” a tiny voice drawing Frieda and Eric’s attention to the water; “I’m hungry.”<br />
“Uh oh,” Eric chuckling; “someone wants lunch.”<br />
<br />
Frieda and Eric seeing Cindy looking at the two were-panther’s in their swimwear, notice as Jasper and Yogi, along with Spencer who was in the pool at the time also swim up. Jasper and Yogi hearing Cindy stating she was hungry gave them a reason to pester the two teenagers as well.<br />
“Looks like we should get some lunch,” Frieda chuckling.<br />
“Any place nearby,” Eric helping the children out of the water.<br />
“The rec center has a cafeteria,” Frieda helping Cindy towel off; “let’s see what they have on the menu.”<br />
“I want tacos,” Jasper shouting as he runs to the change rooms.<br />
“Pizza,” Yogi screams as he too runs.<br />
“If the cafeteria has a taco pizza on the menu,” Eric shaking his head; “then those two will be happy.”<br />
“I doubt it,” Spencer walking to the change rooms along with Eric, Frieda and Cindy; “what do you want for lunch Cindy?”<br />
“Cheese burger,” Cindy answering.<br />
“Now that is something the cafeteria should have,” Eric licking his lips; “with fries smothered in gravy.”<br />
“Now I want that too,” Frieda’s stomach rumbling loudly.<br />
“Same here,” Spencer grinning; “let’s go eat.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Amanda looked bored at the Carpenter estate; not knowing anyone at the baby shower other than Lila, her sister in-law and Ester Carpenter, the hostess of the party. She quietly observes as Lila laughs and chats with her former co-workers at city hall. Watching them hand her presents, of baby clothes and rubbing her belly as she gladly shows off her growing baby bump. Seeing the comptroller Marcus trying to convince Lila to come back to work at city hall; gives Amanda a small chuckle.<br />
<br />
While Amanda has come to realize that Lila was no slouch when it came to figures, budgets and ledgers; she just could not understand what her brother in-law saw in Lila. Sighing as she knows her time to hand over her baby shower present was coming soon. Doing her best to be civil and pleasant; Amanda hands her gift to the expecting were-tigress. Watching Lila rip open the wrapping paper to reveal a top of the line baby car seat, gave out the expect oohs and ahhs. Despite the animosity between the two were’s; Amanda didn’t want any harm to come to the child Lila will soon give birth to. It’s is a Knight after all; even if the mother isn’t.<br />
“It’s not as if we know the baby’s gender yet,” Amanda mumbling; “it was either this car seat or a crib. I can’t fit a crib in my Tesla.”<br />
“That’s okay,” Lila looking at the box; “this is thoughtful gift. You know Amanda,” Lila looking at the reluctant were-panthress; “you’re the only one here not to place her hand on my belly. Don’t you want to feel you future niece or nephew?”<br />
“I don’t know,” Amanda looking unsure; “Isn’t it too early to feel the fetus kick?”<br />
“Come on,” Marcus the large Samoan egging the red head on; followed by the rest of ladies attending the small party.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Sitting at a table in the Rec center cafeteria; Eric, Spence, Frieda, along with Cindy, Jasper and Yogi. Each eating a cheese burger. Since the cafeteria did not have any tacos or pizza available; Jasper and Yogi had to make do with a burger each. Happy that they got gravy on their fries and each sucking soda through a straw; Cindy was looking pleased with her cheeseburger with ketchup on her fries. Opting not to have the gravy, while everyone else chose gravy for their fires.<br />
“I think after this,” Eric looking at the three children; “you little scamps are about ready for a nap.”<br />
“You think it will be safe to take them home,” Spencer looking at Frieda; “isn’t the baby shower still going on?”<br />
“It should be ending soon,” Frieda looking at the time; “plus Jasper and Yogi are looking tired.”<br />
“I don’t need a nap,” Cindy looking at her new cousin; “I’m old enough to be up until bed time!”<br />
“You may have turned seven recently,” Frieda smiling; “but I can tell you are about ready for some zzzz’s. You like your brother’s had quite the fun today,” Frieda continuing; “and I’m sure your mother wouldn’t mind the peace and quiet of seeing you asleep along with Jasper and Yogi.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
With the cake half consumed and all the cookies and brownies made eaten; everyone could sense the baby shower was coming to a close. Lila thanking everyone for coming over as she and Ester escorted them to the front door; it wasn’t lost on either were-tigress that Amanda was still their looking at a photo album of the Carpenter’s children along with Lila.<br />
“Something on your mind,” Ester looking at Amanda.<br />
“Cubs,” Amanda sighing as she closes the photo album; “that is what is on my mind.”<br />
“How so,” Lila picking up empty plates and cups; “you thinking of having another one?”<br />
“The thought hasn’t crossed my mind,” Amanda sighing; “but Benton and I, we sort of screwed things up raising Frieda.”<br />
“How so,” Ester sitting next to the sighing were-panthress.<br />
“We kind of ignored her,” Amanda answering; “once she was older to not need a baby sitter. Not that we needed one. Hell,” Amanda thinking back on some of the shouting matches she had with Frieda; “she called us out on it last year of being treated like possession to be put on display during social events; forced to attend parties with people we wanted her to associate with.”<br />
“They say raising a second child is easier,” Lila answering; “you learn not to make the same mistakes with your second child that you did with your first.”<br />
“Speak for yourself,” Ester snorting; “Rick and I raised Cindy well. Its Jasper and Yogi that are the trouble makers.”<br />
“That’s not the only reason why Benton and I haven’t tried for another cub,” Amanda sighing; “we are both worried the baby might be like Benton. Lila,” Amanda looking at her sister in-law; “while Lance might not have that medical condition, that doesn’t mean you child might not get it. Bi-polar is hereditary, from what I hear. Plus,” Amanda taking a bite of the piece of cake she barely touched; “Benton and I are still struggling to make time for Frieda. It’s hard what with our social obligations and Benton’s roller coaster work schedule.”<br />
“Don’t try and find the time,” Ester answers; “make the time. Even if it’s for only one day a week, make that day family time. It’s what Rick and I do with our children,” Ester getting up to help Lila clean up; “even if Frieda is now fifteen years old,” Ester looking at Amanda nodding; “you should put in the effort, both you and your husband. And if it happens that your husband gets you pregnant,” Ester smiling; &quot;then don’t concern yourself with what ifs. Focus on the here and now instead.”<br />
<br />
Entering the kitchen to see Lila doing the dishes, makes Ester pause for a moment; remembering that her sister in-law no longer lives here, she grunts as she gently moves Lila out of the way.<br />
“Sorry,” Lila chuckling; “force of habit, I guess a part of me thinks I still live here.”<br />
“I’ll just do the dishes when you and Lance have me and Rick over,” Ester looking apologetic; “I should have stopped you from cleaning up, but Amanda their looked like she needed to talk to someone.”<br />
“You know something Ester,” Lila looking at Amanda still sitting in the living room looking at her cellphone; “I’m surprised you are getting along with Amanda. I thought you couldn’t stand snobs?”<br />
“Even with all the money she has in the world Lila,” Ester looking at the woman sitting on the sofa; “she is probably the loneliest woman in the world. Even a snob needs a friend; not just because she is rich, but because she may need a shoulder to cry on one day.”</p>
