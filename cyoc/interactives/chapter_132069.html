<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I could hear the TV going as I entered the door once home. I called out to say I was home and took my new belongings to my room. Then went down to the TV room. Eileen and Ted were snuggled together on the couch. They looked like teenagers caught in the act. Mum asked me how my day had been and said there were a couple of letters on the kitchen bench for me. I told her work had been busy and that we had taken Biddy for a long walk and then had pasta for dinner.<br />
<br />
I looked at the letters they were from the Commonwealth bank. One contained my new card and the other the PIN to go with it. It said I should activate the card and change my PIN. I took it to the family PC and logged in as Jenna then followed the directions to activate the new card. I had noticed she had a Netbank account and without thinking attempted to log in. A thought came to me ‘Jennaemma1668’. I don’t know why or how but that code was suddenly in my mind. The customer ID came up automatically on the computer but it then asked for a password. I thought why not and tried entering Jennaemma1668. It worked!<br />
<br />
Suddenly I was in. There were all the details of Jenna’s bank accounts. I eagerly scanned through the accounts there was the Mastercard showing a debit of $3563 the credit limit was $4000. The saving account showed a credit of $1254 there was no sign of my payment from the receptionist job. I recalled Millicent saying that the pay would be electronically deposited every 2nd Thursday. I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was also the owner of a ‘Netbank saver’ account containing $12790. Overall I was not in debt.<br />
<br />
I was familiar with this bank as it was who I had banked with when I was Zach. I transferred money from the Netbank saver account to pay off the Mastercard. Feeling very satisfied with myself I logged out and shut down the computer. <br />
<br />
I opened the door to the wardrobe in the room. Sarah thought most of these clothes were mine. I looked to see what was there. It mostly seemed to be winter wear. Long skirts, jumpers and coats. On a shelf was a collection of hats. I decided sorting through it could wait for another day. <br />
<br />
I turned off the light and went to say goodnight to Mum and Dad, however the TV and lights had been turned off. I did here a noise. It was coming from behind the closed bedroom door. I listened carefully then felt embarrassed, once I realized it was Eileen moaning. <br />
<br />
I went to the toilet and did my bedroom routine. I considered reading the pirate book but curiosity got the better of me. I pulled out the iPad and tried to crack the code again. Unfortunately Jennaemma1668 wasn’t going to work it needed a 6 figure code. I tried a couple of number combinations around 1668 but nothing worked. I gave up and put away the iPad.<br />
<br />
I saw Jenna’s old journals. I leafed through until I found entries from 2009, when Jenna was 15. I no longer felt I was violating her privacy. It was my history now. I needed to know what had happened to her or should I say me. Jenna was an infrequent writer. Entries were generally only a short paragraph. Sometimes they were from consecutive nights but often it was only once per week and occasionally it was month between entries.<br />
<br />
I took the journal to bed and started reading in January 2009. They had just returned from a holiday at Lorne. Jenna had chosen school subject entering into year 11 that would allow her to do Marine Biology at university. She described some of the sea creatures she had seen at the ocean. She also wrote of meeting a boy called Eric. She was disappointed that he hadn’t kissed her. <br />
<br />
The next few entries were more mundane, going shopping and meeting Bianca, visiting her grandparents and having a fight with Mum because she wanted a dog. <br />
<br />
At the end of January she started year 11. She wanted to get the eye of a boy called Lance, (I couldn’t recall a Lance from school) and was disappointed that he started going out with another of the girls Georgie (I could vaguely recall a brunette called Georgie who would have been in her year). She sounded very insecure thinking that she wasn’t attractive enough, that her breasts were too small and that maybe Lance though she was too much of a Tomboy. She was jealous because her little sister had a bigger bust than she did. Someone had told her that too much sport stopped your breasts from growing.<br />
<br />
The entry from February 27 2009 was interesting. She had a fight with Bianca. Jenna didn’t want to play netball anymore because it was making her breasts small. Bianca had called her stupid and said that sport had nothing to do with your breast size. She had also been invited to a school party.<br />
<br />
The next entry described the party. She got to talk with this Lance. He and Georgie were no longer an item. She had kissed him and he had invited her to the movies. He had told her that to make your breasts grow bigger they needed to be massaged properly. He had shown her how to do this. It felt really nice. (I thought Jenna was meant to be a A grade student)<br />
<br />
On March 13 Jenna wrote of her date with Lance they had pashed in the seats and been booted out of the cinema. They had gone to the park and Lance had given her another massage. She felt that her breasts were growing. Lance had explained they would not get to full size until she was fully a woman. To become a woman she would need to lose her virginity. She wasn’t yet ready for that.<br />
<br />
On March 24 Jenna was very upset. Lance’s family were moving to Sydney. He would be going with them that was only 3 weeks away. She was going to lose the love of her life.<br />
<br />
On April the 3rd Jenna was a true woman now. She was determined that Lance would not forget her. Sex had felt great. She described how they had made love on the grass in the park. Lance had at least used a condom. She was going to wag school on Monday and meet Lance at his house while his parents were working. <br />
<br />
The next entry was on April 12th. Lance had left on Friday. Would she ever see him again? Sarah had been a stupid little sister and had refused to lend her bra when she had gone to say farewell to Lance. Jenna’s own bras were now too small so she had ended up borrowing Sarah’s new panty and bra set that Sarah had been given for her birthday and had yet to wear. Their chests were now the same size proving how Lance was right and Bianca was wrong. <br />
<br />
Subsequent entries described her attempts to seduce some of the other boys at school. She described a failed attempt to get the attention of Zach in year 12. That must have been me. I recall I was dating Claudia Johnson at the time. <br />
<br />
Some of these seductions were successful. She went through about a dozen boyfriends in the next 6 months. None of them measured up to Lance. She was actually quite scathing of the penis size of some of the boys. Included among these was Jack Bailey from my former basketball team. I had not realized he and Jenna had a history. Evidently Jacks penis did not measure up to the lance of Lance.<br />
<br />
I glanced at the time on the phone. It was nearly midnight. As fascinated as I was with the journal I needed to work in the morning. I turned off the light and was soon asleep.</p>
