<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(I have to apologize fr these small parts and having them be so far apart from each other. <br />
I've been suffering writer's block I think.)<br />
<br />
Serenity's unused turn, unable to be used, was a part of the curse. And that meant that it <br />
knew about Madam Serenity and her actions now that the curse had reached critical mass <br />
and had become truly aware of it's own existence across all it's subparts and had gained a <br />
full spectrum of emotions.<br />
<br />
And that meant, even as it thought about how to proceed, it sensed everything Serenity <br />
considered, and the Pack and damaged she-wolves planned. And sensing the comments <br />
about Ashley, Megan and Margot playing the 'for the great good of the pack' card, the <br />
curse sensed that it too had to proceed along that same line. Before the curse was not <br />
aware enough, before it was a mindless aimless force of sadism. Now however it knew and <br />
was aware. And now shifted it's gears from causing misery, to ensuring it's own survival to <br />
spread human suffering another day.<br />
<br />
Human, pst! It had had such high hopes for the pack. Slavery was always such a beautiful <br />
source of misery. But the wolves weren't in the least bit miserable about it! If it was the <br />
mindless eagerness to have sex with their master as all the harems before it it wouldn't be <br />
so bad. Mindless lust was a tangy but very tasty dish.<br />
<br />
But these wolves were becoming increasingly horrid tasting! It was time to put them back <br />
on track!<br />
<br />
And the pride, it had had such high hopes for it! Not only for the coming conflict between <br />
Gill and the officers who accepted the existence of the curse, but the instinctual polygamy <br />
tearing Felicity and Brian apart and Mary suffering in horror as she watched! Not to <br />
mention the tasty meat of war, something the curse had only on a few rare occasion <br />
tasted, but had been so delicious each time! A war between the pack and the pride would <br />
have been absolutely delicious.<br />
<br />
But Felicity was by the very thing the curse had given her was quickly becoming relaxed to <br />
the idea, and Mary was already figuring that if the pride found happiness then it <br />
undermined everything the curse desired, WHICH IT DID!  As for Gill and his officers, well, <br />
that was it's last hope in that department.<br />
<br />
And of course.... with Ashley, Margot, and Megan, and with Abbey's assistance, planning to <br />
simply march back into the manor, and waiting till there was only nine others with Jensen <br />
present, to put the shackles of civilized thinking back on the Big Bad Wolf... that beautiful <br />
scrumptious war would never ever come... and the Curse itself would be DOOM!!!  And <br />
that meant no more misery spread by the game by petty short sighted people want to one <br />
over another in an endless cycle.<br />
<br />
The curse now that it was fully aware, knew about a similiar cycle on the internet where <br />
humans told stories and each story teller tried their hardest to wrestle the direction of the <br />
story in a completely different direction, often doing so by writing newer and stronger and <br />
more powerful and smarter and more clear thinking (from the narrative's point of view) <br />
every post to dominate the flow of the story.  Sadly, the curse could not be spread via the <br />
internet, most people on-line lacking the verbal connection to transfur the curse, not to <br />
mention that the curse was limited to Glendale's limits give or take a few miles.<br />
<br />
If it could make sure the war between the pack and the pride happen,it could have <br />
everything it wanted, and the suffering and misery and bloodlust would be a <br />
smorgasbord!!  The three damaged wolves had to be nullified!<br />
<br />
Sadly it could not effect the pride in any way that would lead them to putting the she <br />
wolves under restraint and what not since Felicity and her family had forgiven the broken <br />
wolves for their part in things. AGH! Forgiveness! What a meaningless thing! It never made <br />
sense to the curse at all even now that it was aware! Forgiveness didn't change what <br />
someone did, so it didn't do anything!!!<br />
<br />
That left the pack. While it sickened the curse to no end that it would have to make <br />
concessions that would leave it with a awful taste in it's mouth, it would have to slip under <br />
the radar to effect the Alphas in he proper way that would nullify Margot and Megan! <br />
Ashley currently didn't have a turn so her nullification as a threat could wait. But margot <br />
and Megan had turns! And once the shackles were back on Jensen's mind... the rest of the <br />
pack would be doomed to follow.<br />
<br />
And while the curse knew it wouldn't be able to effect things outside of Glendale, at least <br />
on the island it would be able to eat up the hardships of the wolves suffering without the <br />
modern conveniences that had grown used to and having to suffer greetly as they <br />
struggled to support their population, and the curse wondered how long after the pack's <br />
baby boom that the island would simply become too small to support the pack itself <br />
forcing the wolves to return to Glendale or somewhere else, inspiring another conflict with <br />
humanity that was sure to be nice, fearful and violent. Tasty.<br />
<br />
Yes! Megan and Margot had to be eliminated as threats. Before they could enact their <br />
scheme that would set in motion the complete ruination of everything that curse had <br />
done. After three hundred and ten years, the curse would NOT be stopped by the turns <br />
used by two generic cookie cutter spiteful teenagers in the scope of a week!!!<br />
<br />
Ulysses and Sarah were still salvagable, but Amy... she had become too much like a <br />
cancer... she had to be ambutated.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a pity we had to lose the statues.&quot; The dark brown Isabelle commented. &quot;You know <br />
how much Alpha Female loved them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.. now that I think about it.&quot; Grace admitted, &quot;It is a pity, but Master wanted the <br />
powers of the new pups tested and there was no point in sending the pups to the gallery <br />
if it was for nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope and Isabelle nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still,&quot; Isabelle said, &quot;You think we could get some replacements for them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope wondered, &quot;It would make Alpha Female happy. And that would make Master happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isabelle and Grace nodded.<br />
<br />
Hope thought pragmatically, &quot;Still, with everything going on, we can't just go out and use <br />
the game on some people and lose the turns and reduce them to art for Alpha Female.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee's three recolored replicas sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should speak with Master about it.&quot; Hope got the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now? During all this?&quot; Grace replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes during all this, Alpha Female is going to be very upset about losing her video <br />
games... so imagine how happy she'll be, and how happy Master will be, if she can get <br />
some replacements before we've evacuated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace and Isabelle nodded at the idea. &quot;So let's go speak to Master then.&quot; Grace said.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;The one thing about being a kid that's not cool?&quot; Jenny said as she and the other pups <br />
were in a circle with Mr. P and Martha close by, both of Martha's heads looking in different <br />
directions. They were in the pup's bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Bart asked the black as night pup.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel kinda helpless... like things are just blowin' over us! We gotta drop everything we <br />
are and everything we do! Leaving only the grotesques and shadows here! We gotta <br />
dumped our business and go campin' on an island for who knows how long!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's gonna be kinda cool.&quot; Kevin protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Marcy nodded in agreement with her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are just pups.&quot; Martha's head said putting a paw on each of their heads with her <br />
four arms, &quot;You are the pack's future. You're too precious to endanger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny sighed, &quot;But I wanna HELP mom and dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll help them most by keeping yourself and your younger siblings safe.&quot; Martha told <br />
the nine year old sagely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Martha.&quot; Jenny breathed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there room for one more?&quot; Came Pearl's voice with june and Zackery behind her, in <br />
front of her was her son politely knocking the door to which Martha carefully opened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... of course there is.&quot; Martha nodded, &quot;But... where's Amy?&quot;<br />
<br />
June said, &quot;She said she needed to go outside and get some air... that was a little bit ago. <br />
I'm worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zackery said, &quot;Zelipe, you stay here with Miss Martha and the other pups... I'm going to go <br />
look for your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll come with you.&quot; June said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I want you and Pearl to be among the first to leave the manor after the pups.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's my daughter!&quot;  'I know I'm loyal and love Master only because I'm brainwashed, I <br />
know I only not dislike Zackery because I'm brainwashed, and I know I love my daughter <br />
only because of her transformation from Zackery's father into my baby but... THEY'RE REAL <br />
TO NOW ME DAMMIT!!'  &quot;I'm not leaving with her, end of story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... alright.&quot; Zackery hugged Pearl, &quot;You stay near Zelipe, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear.&quot; Pearl hugged back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go sniff out Amy.&quot; June said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are Alice, Abbey and Samantha?&quot; Marcy had to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're helping move everything to the island,&quot; Martha's heads said, &quot;All three of them are <br />
helping the way they can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny said, &quot;Don't worry 'bout them sis', they're indestructible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Marcy nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go sniff out our daughter.&quot; June said to Zackery.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allow me.&quot; The charcoal black big bad wolf answered.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The gallery wolves weren't sure what to do with themselves, all they knew was that they <br />
were Big Bad Wolves and that they loved and served their Master, nothing else mattered. <br />
They had been told to help in evacuating the house, and had proceeded to do just that. It <br />
had been clumsy going as the twelve of them quickly elected to stay together for the <br />
moment. Betty chose to take the lead. She asked about her nephew, not having a clue how <br />
she could have possibly known about Lawrence being part of the pack already, but was <br />
disappointed to learn he had already relocated to the island.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY YOU! You yes you! You two! The two carrying the pink fur so well!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose and Kimberly turned to see another pink wolf, pink as the hair of an anime character, <br />
flanked by a similar japanese cartoon character hair color orange and white, and a <br />
magenta she wolf. Kimberly giggled at seeing the tiny heart mark on the orange one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes? And you would all be?&quot; Rose ask politely and calmly as a fine and proper lady <br />
should.<br />
<br />
&quot;Howdy sistah!&quot; The magenta one waved, &quot;I'm all Robyn, this here cutie is Millie, and dis <br />
fine lookin' lady in pink all like yerselves is Maxine!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hi.&quot; Millie waved politely in turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;A nice to see a couple more pink she wolves in the pack!&quot; Maxine greeted, &quot;So you girls <br />
new? Of course yer new cause I ain't seen ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Rose. This is Kimberly, I and the rest of us were up until today part of <br />
Glendale's art gallery... we were rescued by Little Miss Amy and Young Sir Zelipe...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well welcome ya all to da pack!&quot; Maxine cheered, &quot;Sorry ya gotta join atta time like this, <br />
but hey! Glade to meetcha!&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty interrupted, &quot;We were instructed to aid in the evacuation, which seems so far to be <br />
moving a lot of stuff into mirrors, can you help us find a task?&quot;<br />
<br />
Robyn snapped her fingers, &quot;No problem! Just you wait and see!&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I should go...&quot; Lawrence said suddenly out of the blue, sounding like he was repeating a <br />
line from a script.<br />
<br />
Carnelian started, &quot;Don't be absurd you just got here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you don't!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to go!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master ordered that we look after you and that's that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lawrence began walking, ignoring his dislocated shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're male! That means you obey whatever one of us females tell you! ANd I tell you to <br />
stay!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lawrence halted. Then he began to move, but kept stopping. His muscles seeming to be <br />
wanting to do two things at once. For some reason Carnelian thought of a robot trying to <br />
defy the Three Laws through sheer will power.<br />
<br />
Of course, if Lawrence knew his auntie was there he could ague she wanted to meet with <br />
him, and that was something she wanted and thus he'd be obeying her. But he had no way <br />
to know she was there yet... So it was knowledge he couldn't even have and thus couldn't <br />
even use! But still something was pushing him! He needed to be somewhere at a precise <br />
time for something important!<br />
<br />
Lawrence felt like he was going mad... Carnelian jumped on top of him, pain zapping into <br />
his brain. &quot;OUCH!&quot; Lawrence shook his head, &quot;Eh? What?&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Alexandra with Nicole leading along Nick by his wolfhood turned their heads when they <br />
saw Roger (still with one eye closed and bloody) getting up from where he was resting in <br />
the co-ed den and walking out, &quot;I have to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay go.&quot; Nick said, figuring Roger wanted to use the bathroom one last time before they <br />
had to switch to banna leaves. <br />
<br />
