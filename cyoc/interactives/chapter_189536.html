BRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING<br />
BRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING<br />
<br />
That was the chorus that welcomed Dave back into the realm of the living.<br />
<br />
It was both familiar and so completely crushing. It meant that the job was calling. He recognized the ring tone he had for it. Though curiously, as he blearily got up to take the call, he noted he was not feeling nearly as bad today as he had been yesterday. He shook his head as he remembered last night. A gay dalliance, a blowjob for the ages, and a connection he had not expected. And today he was feeling...different. Not bad. But definitely...different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Dave,&quot; the voice on the other end said, &quot;We gotta have you in the office today. Eric called in sick. You know how it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice on the other end was Mitch, his boss. Though a curiously different sounding Mitch today. Mitch Landswell was his boss at the office - they did analysis and data entry for anyone who needed it. Of course, the job didn&#39;t exactly have much in the way of upward advancement as things were, and Mitch Landswell took home easily the largest paycheck. Always a reward for his &quot;exemplary service in the corporate good&quot;.<br />
<br />
More like self service, Dave had always felt like saying. But he knew he was old, he was expendable and if he lost this job he was up shit creek even further and sinking at that rate. Mitch was exceedingly well connected around the area, on top of being a wealthy son of a bitch. And Eric? Eric was his favorite guy on the floor. They always went working out, playing cards and pool, and doing all that standard guy stuff together. The collusion and covering was obvious.<br />
<br />
So what was it today? Did Eric drink too much last night? Overdose on steroids that morning? Need to pay off a mistress to keep her from going public about the affair? All those were equally likely in a man who largely took the job to assuage his father that yes, young Eric really was going to be getting some real world experience. Rather than any actual need.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah,&quot; Dave said with a practiced ease, &quot;I&#39;ll be in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great to hear,&quot; And again Dave was left wondering about his boss. &quot;I&#39;ll see you in, ciao!&quot; Followed by a chuckle and the call disconnecting.<br />
<br />
Dave groaned and got up, seeing that Todd was nowhere to be seen. It seemed, he decided, like Todd was out or doing something outside. Probably hitting the gym or something. Dave shrugged his shoulders and walked, naked, to the bathroom to get a survey of that morning&#39;s damages. But something still seemed weird. He felt...energetic now. Like he was in a better place than he really was. Fuck, Dave thought with a wry grin, I feel like I&#39;m some 21 year old kid again.<br />
<br />
Dave paused in the bathroom as he stared at the mirror.<br />
<br />
He WAS some 21 year old kid again. But certainly not the old Dave, no sirree.<br />
<br />
Darting to the mirror to inspect himself, Dave saw that he was now younger, slimmer, much more taut and toned. His body was only very lightly hairy, and Dave swore that his face looked...cute. Kind of like one of those boyband members from the bands he pointedly skipped past whenever they showed up on the radio. Thick, boyish and disheveled hair, steely gray eyes, and kissable lips. His features were angular, handsome, and yet in a certain model-esque manner. Almost a mix of effete and masculine, the sort of look one might expect to see in some night club.<br />
<br />
Dave bit his lip when he looked down and saw his cock. Thicker, bigger, ohh man that was a lady pleaser...and going by last night, a dude pleaser too. Dave found himself smirking before long. He cupped his cock and flexed his pecs, seeing them ripple for the first time in...ever! His abs...oh, those looked nice. He chuckled to himself and, even though he knew he had only 90 minutes before he needed to head in, he screwed around a bit; &quot;You ready for a hot little number from me, babe? I got a song with your name on it?&quot; He winked - and flushed red as he felt his dick pulse.<br />
<br />
Yeah, definitely younger than he had been in some time. He felt soooo much better!<br />
<br />
A quick shower and morning meal, consisting of some protein cereal and other nutrition stuff that Todd had laying around in ample amount, and Dave distinctly felt good. He started to wonder about how he could handle this. Dave saw a note on the desk by the kitchen table, saying Todd had left a shirt and pants there for Dave to change in to if he needed to go out that day. Thoughtful!<br />
<br />
Well, a quick change and Dave found himself looking far more like Todd&#39;s type. His black hair was no longer peppered with grey hair, and it looked thick, sexy and young. The polo shirt he now wore and tight dress pants probably did him a big favor. He looked like any woman&#39;s dream - as well as any so inclined man&#39;s. For some reason as Dave stood there taking in the new him, he found his resistance to the idea diminished. Sure he was into women, that hadn&#39;t changed in as far as he knew.<br />
<br />
But that BJ yesterday had been amazing, and Dave wasn&#39;t exactly opposed to another.<br />
<br />
With ample time to get to the analysis job, Dave headed out.<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
When Dave got to the job and looked around, it seemed there was some chatter going on. Something was up. Dave didn&#39;t even know what, but it seemed something had changed around the office. As he clocked in, he saw Mitch. And Mitch looked fucking different today now too. The wealthy, well to do man looked like his tux had to be adjusted to fit a more svelte, toned body as opposed to the powerfully muscled if rather toneless physique he usually had. Mitch usually had a brutish face that belied his preppy heritage. But today he looked more polished, somewhat boyish, and his hair - usually styled in a militaristic buzz cut - was now thicker, somewhat longer, and enhanced his overall distinct impression.<br />
<br />
As usual, he was with his secretary, Linda Lisle, a busty and attractive red head whose sarcastic and often cutting demeanor made it clear she was not exactly hired for her friendly demeanor with those who needed to see Mitch. It was no secret he hired her for her looks and because they&#39;d been fucking long since before she got the job. It was pretty much an open secret that Mitch very often had sex with her up in his office, taking advantage of its position and the lack of windows looking in from the rest of the building.<br />
<br />
But it seemed he was being oddly friendly today.<br />
<br />
Dave decided this merited some investigation. He proceeded up to the office, and saw Linda as usual right by her boss&#39; side...and when Mitch saw Dave he took in the man&#39;s new youthful visage and grinned, &quot;Hey, hey, welcome to the office, glad you could make it in here in Eric&#39;s stead. You know how things are for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yeah...&quot; Dave bit his lip and then asked, &quot;Hey boss, uh, are you feeling okay today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Feeling okay? I&#39;m feeling amazing!&quot; Mitch laughed outloud, and gave a coy look at Dave, &quot;You&#39;re looking like you&#39;re doing pretty well today yourself.&quot; Linda seemed a little confused by how friendly he was being with the men in the office, especially when he was so nice to Dave, who he usually stepped on unapologetically. But today? Today he was projecting nothing but a weird sort of politeness. Almost flirtatious in nature.<br />
<br />
Dave definitely caught that now. &quot;Well, I have been working out a bit lately...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It shows! Maybe Eric, you and I could all hit the gym together some time, guys night out or something!&quot; Yeah, something weird was definitely going on with Mitch. Well, maybe he needed to just see what else might be going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah that sounds great. Can I uh, talk to you after the shift?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing! I&#39;ll see you later. Now... I have some business to attend to.&quot; A nod, a wink, and Dave headed out. As usual, though, Linda followed her boss into the office. Dave knew it wouldn&#39;t be long before those two started getting down to business, as it were. He rolled his eyes. As much as some things, it seemed, changed, others stayed the same. At least for now. Dave kind of wondered about that. If there was something more going on. Maybe he could wait a bit and try and listen in on the goings on in the office once the...merriment...started.<br />
<br />
Once Dave got to his desk he looked at the clock by his computer. Usually it took about 30 minutes in there before the games were out of the way and the screwing began. He usually hated having to deal with it, but today he was curious if anything might be going on differently than usual between those two.<br />
<br />
Dave set a silent alarm for twenty minutes rather than thirty, out of curiosity. He figured it might take a little less time since Mitch was different today. The one thing about the set up those two had was that the door to Mitch&#39;s office was really thin, and there WAS one small window that looked in on the office at the top of the door. Anyone who got up real close to the door would be able to see and hear what was going on in there - and the two inside wouldn&#39;t be able to return the favor.<br />
<br />
Dave bit his lip and took his seat, breathing and wondering what might be going on around here.</p>
