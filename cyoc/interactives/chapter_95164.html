<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It&#39;s a couple days after you first got the magic socks and turned into your own dad.  You&#39;d been itching to use them again, but you had to wait for the right moment.  Now you were sitting on a bench in the park.  You asked your friends to meet you there.  You couldn&#39;t just keep these babies to yourself.  You had to tell somebody!<br />
<br />
Looking around you see your friends arrive.  The park was empty aside from you and your friends.  That&#39;s why you chose here and now.<br />
<br />
Both your friends look around for a bit before shrugging and eventually approaching you.  The short, chubby one was Colby.  His skin was naturally tan, but a little pale from spending so much time inside.  It contrasted with his thick, black, though short hair and his pathetic teenage attempt to grow a mustache.  Walking behind him was your tall, skinny friend George.  He was easily spotted with his head of bright red hair and the fact he was the tallest guy in your grade level.<br />
<br />
You smile as they approach you. Though, they don&#39;t realize it&#39;s you.  After all, you are wearing the magic socks along with your dad&#39;s shoes.  You&#39;d grabbed some of your dad&#39;s clothes while he was away at work and your brother wasn&#39;t looking.  You wanted to savor the feel of your father&#39;s mature, muscular body while you waited for your friends.  At first, you weren&#39;t a big fan of the way your father&#39;s beer belly hung off your otherwise muscular frame, though you&#39;ve quickly grown used to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, kids,&quot; you turn to your two friends as they approach.  &quot;Looking for somebody?&quot;  It&#39;s strange.  Your friends look so young, now.  They don&#39;t actually look any different, but now they look so small.  You briefly wonder if you&#39;ve gained your father&#39;s adult perceptions and mannerisms along with his form.<br />
<br />
George nods.  &quot;Yeah, we were supposed to meet-&quot;<br />
<br />
You chuckle.  &quot;Oh, he&#39;ll be along in a minute.&quot;  You slip off your shoes.  No, your father&#39;s shoes.  You slip off your father&#39;s shoes, exposing your magic socks.  You then dip your feet into your teen-sized shoes, which you&#39;d placed under the bench.  You put your feet as far in as they&#39;d go.  &quot;He just needs to get changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them stand there awkwardly for a bit.  You grin at them.  They&#39;d always been shy, and your father had always been something of an imposing figure, even when sitting.  Though, you can feel the changes beginning.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what are you boys up to these days?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby shrugs.  &quot;Stuff, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
George also shrugs.  &quot;My mom&#39;s got me doing summer sports.  I got on the soccer JV team.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, feeling your clothes grow a little looser.  You feel the hair on your arms grow less dense and your forehead itch as your hairline moves forward.  &quot;Good.  I think my son will be here any minute, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby starts staring at you as you lose height.  The gray in your hair and beard stubble vanishes and George stares as well.  You&#39;re almost yourself again.  As before, the body fat seems to be the last to go.<br />
<br />
As the prominent lump that is your stomach shrinks away, both your friends back away a step.<br />
<br />
You stand up, your feet now fitting perfectly into your shoes, though your clothes were made for a man twice your size, which you were only a moment ago.  &quot;Pretty cool, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
As you predicted, your friends had a lot of questions, which you answer to the best of your ability.  They thought is was all an elaborate hoax at first, but after letting them check the area for mirrors or hidden cameras, you think they&#39;re at least half convinced.<br />
<br />
After waving his arms under the bench for the fifth time, George throws his hands up in exasperation.  &quot;But I don&#39;t get it!  It&#39;s - it&#39;s just not possible!&quot;<br />
<br />
You dangle your dad&#39;s shoes in the air.  &quot;But I just told you how it works!  I even changed right in front of you.  I&#39;m even still wearing his clothes, which really don&#39;t fit me, by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby gives you the strangest look, something between a glare and a smirk.  &quot;Then do it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile back at him.  &quot;Alright.&quot;  You drop your dad&#39;s shoes and the ground and start taking off your own.<br />
<br />
He shakes his head.  &quot;Not with those.&quot;  He sits on the bench and pulls off his flat-bottomed boarding shoes.  &quot;With these.&quot;<br />
<br />
You consider it.  As much as you liked being your dad (that is a strange though, by the way) you really wanted to convince these guys.  Perhaps the only way to do that would be to wear Colby&#39;s shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot;  You sit down next to Colby and put his shoes on.  They were designed for skate boarding, but you&#39;d never known Colby to do any sort of boarding besides board games in his life.  The first shoe slips on easily, as Colby&#39;s feet are larger than yours.  As you slip the second shoe on you feel a brief bust of exhilaration.  There was something exciting about becoming a different person.  Now you had an audience.  You regret not having a mirror before you remember your phone.  Your retrieve it from the front pocket of your dad&#39;s pants, which you were still wearing, and turn on the front camera so you could have a view of your face.<br />
<br />
George peers over your shoulder &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
You lean away from his intrusion.  &quot;I want to see, too!&quot;<br />
<br />
You begin to feel an odd, yet familiar sensation.  It was the same you you got when changing from your dad into yourself.  You were losing height.  Colby was at least six inches shorter than you, so it wasn&#39;t totally surprising.  You also feel your feet filling up the shoes you were wearing.  The shoes actually feel a little small.<br />
<br />
&quot;Colby, your shoes are getting tight.&quot;<br />
<br />
He&#39;d already leaped off the bench when you&#39;d began shrinking.  &quot;Y-yeah.  My mom and I were, uh, going to get new ones next week.&quot;<br />
<br />
You see your hair is quickly darkening to Colby&#39;s deep pitch, as well as retracting into your head, matching his haircut.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way.&quot;  George has backed away, leaning against a tree.  His hand his covering his mouth.  You&#39;re afraid he might try to run away, but then he starts laughing.  His eyes are wide and he&#39;s staring at you and he&#39;s laughing.<br />
<br />
You begin to feel another strange, yet familiar sensation.  You begin to bloat up as you take on Colby&#39;s pudgy qualities.  You ears have already shifted to stick out more, your nose pulled in and turned up.  Despite your much too large shirt, you can see a sphere of pudge pushing out from your torso.  You cheeks quickly round out as you gain a second chin.  You feel your chest gain two moobs which roll slightly.  Your digits become thick, as well as your arms and thighs.  You watch on your phone screen as, one by one, black hairs poke out above your upper lip, the beginnings of what may some day become a mature and dignified mustache.  you feel a prickling under your shirt.  You lift it up to find a light dusting of hair on your chest, between your fleshy moobs, as well as a faint trail leading up along your large, overhanging stomach.<br />
<br />
You glance up at Colby.  &quot;You&#39;ve already got chest hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby turns a shade of red and nods, still in shock over your changes.  &quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel the changes come to a stop.  You now inhabit the body of Colby.  To be honest, you weren&#39;t really looking forward into turning into him.  Yes, you were exhilarated, but you would&#39;ve much rather been your dad.  However, now that you&#39;ve done it, you don&#39;t mind it so much.  In fact, you don&#39;t even mind his mustache, which you&#39;d thought was dumb before.  With time and proper groomer, you might have something there.  You also really have an itch to play a video game.<br />
<br />
George, struggling  to keep is composure, takes a step toward you.  &quot;So, how do you feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug, in what you imagine is a perfect imitation of Colby.  &quot;Fine, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby shakes his head.  &quot;Okay, I have to have a go with those.&quot;<br />
<br />
George nods.  &quot;Oh yeah, I have to try those out.&quot;</p>
