<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Upon asking her question, Lucy was created by a number of voices all talking at once. Each girl putting forth their own suggestion of either waiting until they could explore the Chronivac together or why they ought to at least try it for no more than an hour, it was Lucy who got everyone&#39;s attention by pursing her lips and emitting a loud whistle.<br />
<br />
Everyone looking at her, she smiled and said, &quot;We each have valid points as to what we ought to do. I tend to agree with Felicity and Jennifer when they say we ought to wait, as we already have plans for this weekend. But, at the same time, I see Diana, Tanya, and Natalie&#39;s side of the matter on why we ought to try it, at least for an hour. So, I think the best way to settle this is with a flip of a coin,&quot; and turning to the desk, she opened the main drawer, fished around a bit before taking out a quarter.<br />
<br />
Holding it up to the group, she explained, &quot;Heads, we wait. Tails, we try the programme for an hour. Agreed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Five heads nodded, and Lucy placed the coin on her thumb and pointer finger. Trying to imitate what she&#39;d seen an adult do, it took her a couple tries before she was able to flick the thing upward, and each watching it rise up, spinning, then drop, they each stepped back, except for Lucy, who pushed the chair she was sitting in out of the way, and when the quarter at last stopped on the hard plastic laid down for the desk and chair to sit on, they stared at the coin, tails side up.<br />
<br />
With this decided, the next thing each wanted was to know who would use the programme. Another round of fast talking, and Felicity and Jennifer voiced their hesitancy, though both were unsure why they felt so, and in the end, they said they&#39;d watch. Lucy, after changing her hair back to its normal shade, offered to be the one who ran the computer to make sure nothing went wrong, and after a quick talk amongst themselves, Diana, Tanya, and Natalie volunteered. Talking amongst themselves further, each came up with an idea, and in the end, it was decided what they&#39;d do. Explaining it to Lucy, who giggled at the idea, the exclaimed, &quot;That&#39;s awesome,&quot; they turned to the computer.<br />
<br />
It not revealed Lucy had scanned the entire group, none of them seemed really bothered except the two new girls. And as the four original friends huddled together, Felicity and Jennifer, who suddenly had an inkling who they&#39;d been, whispered back and forth between themselves about whether it would be dangerous or not to let the others monkey around with the programme. Jennifer hissing, &quot;I&#39;m not getting stuck like this girl,&quot; which left her confused, as a part of her insisted she was a girl, had always been one, whilst the part of her still Jeff, now rearing back up, was terrified of the by the notion of being stuck as Jennifer. Nodding, Felicity, who sort of recalled being Alan, offered a suggestion, and after a hurried conversation, it was decided they had to do something, but what, they couldn&#39;t agree.<br />
<br />
As the two talked and tried to come up with a solution, Lucy, Natalie, Tanya, and Diana scrolled through each of their profiles. Looking at the options, it was decided in the end for the three to become plush toys. Setting the timer for an hour, and making sure the awareness was set for only those in the room, they then set it so they could psychically communicate with among themselves and those who hadn&#39;t changed, as well as give themselves the ability to still move about. Next, they each choose their plush form, with Diana immediately selecting the option to become a ten-inch, jointed Angelina Ballerina plush doll, Tanya a plush Dalmatian, and Natalia settled on a being a twelve in plush pastel-blue earth pony with a crossed wheat stalk cutie mark. Going through and making sure nothing was off, they then nodded to Lucy, and she saved and initiated the changes.<br />
<br />
What happened next, none of them had expected. An itching sensation washing over the three, they each dropped to the floor. But not heavily, as by the time they hit, their weight had already dropped and their insides had already began morphing into batting. Faux fur sprouting over their bodies, it was shocking to them when their mouths sealed up and they lost the ability to breath. But it was nothing compared to when their vision went black as Diana&#39;s eyes became stitched eyes, Tanya&#39;s became hard plastic, and Natalia&#39;s turned vinyl with the appearance of an eye painted on each. Then their vision returned, and as hands and feet became hooves, rounded paws with string sewn over to give the look up paws, and, in the case of Diana, her feet shifted so she took the appearance of standing on her toes, clothes for two of them vanished, whilst Diana&#39;s pants, shirt and shoes shifted to become a skirt, ballet slippers, and a top which matched the skirt. The last thing to form was a tail for each of them, and a mane for Natalia, it wasn&#39;t long before Felicity, Jennifer, and Lucy found themselves looking at three plush lying on the floor.<br />
<br />
Nobody saying anything or moving, it was Diana who broke the silence by thinking   with each thought getting stronger, more assured the more she grew comfortable using the ability.<br />
<br />
The other two struggling for a minute, it was Natalie who was the first of the other two to cry out   before Tanya joined in with  and each struggling to understand and regain control of their new bodies, it took them each almost ten minutes or so before, in a clumsy manner, they finally figured out how to move without having bones, muscles, and such.<br />
<br />
Lucy, torn between wanting to laugh at the antics of the three and horrified by what she saw, did note how Felicity and Jennifer hung back. Chalking it up to them simply being the new girls of the group, she did wonder briefly why their profiles were already on the Chronivac, but then the matter was driven from her mind as Diana, tail twitching forced herself up, followed by Tanya, then Natalie. Walking about, looking at the three who&#39;d stayed human, after some time, Natalie thought  to which the other two agreed.<br />
<br />
Getting over how she felt, Lucy settled on laughing and sliding onto the floor, inviting Felicity and Jennifer, who&#39;d forgotten again who they&#39;d been and what they needed to do, for the next hour, they played with the three plush. When the hour was up, neither wanted to say it, but each was relieved when they regained their humanity. After a quick check to make sure everything was as it was supposed to be, they started discussing what it&#39;d been like to change into plush toys, the difficulty of being so, and how they enjoyed the brief time, but were glad to become their former selves. The conversation turning to dinner, as Diana, Tanya, and Natalie expressed how hungry they were, and attributed it to what they experienced, the Chronivac was forgotten by all but one as they exited the office. Going to find Lucy&#39;s aunt to ask if they could order the promised pizza, the girls began talking about what they wanted on the pizza and what movies they should watch.</p>
