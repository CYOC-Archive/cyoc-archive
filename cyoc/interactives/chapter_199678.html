<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was dark as Alex lay beneath the sheets, silk draped on every side of him as he gazed at the ceiling, the crescent moons ghostly glow bleeding through the balcony archway, he then heard a familiar groan, rolling onto his side to see the face of Amunet, her expression relaxed as she slept, her hair draped over her cheek and eye, her breath steady and slow.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s gaze groped down her body, seeing her arms wrapped gently around his, the feeling of her silk like skin and warm soft breasts enveloping his arm was unlike anything he had ever experienced, but what a wonderful experience it was, their bodies entangled for hours on end, their taste of eachothers lips still lingering on the tongue, their tender touch, Alex thought that this woman was unable to feel such emotions, but she had surely proved him wrong.<br />
____________________________________________<br />
After Alex&#39;s impressive display, the pharao had practically dragged him to her bed chamber once more, her Jackal seen laying on the balcony, enjoying the morning sun, she then ripped her headress from her head, letting her golden locks flow free once more, before reaching up and crushing her lips against his, Alex had been reluctant at first, suspicious of her sudden change, bit after a bit of convincing his doubts were put at ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should I endulge your lust, first you set your dog on me, have me locked up, blindfolded, handcuffed and then set a giant bird on me, so forgive me if I don&#39;t believe that your intentions are good or innocent&quot; he had said, venom practically dripping from every word.<br />
<br />
She had looked hurt, her eyes glassy &quot;I know....I was scared, but I couldn&#39;t show it, as Pharao I can&#39;t loose face, everyone needs to see you as cold and calculating, devoid of emotion and devoted to the throne and the gods&quot; she had said as she turned from him, looking into a large golden mirror that was attached to the wall opposite the balcony.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you were something new, you came through a mirror of gold, showed no fear unlike other men, your nature not timid nor submissive, you were brave, strong, and that armor, is unlike anything I have ever seen&quot; she said as she turned to look at Alex once again &quot;a pharao does not ask for forgiveness, mostly because I believe I am not worthy of forgiveness, but I ask you, can you find it in your heart?&quot; She said her arms open as she faced Alex.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s face remained still as stone as he looked at Amuna, he could hear the Jackals breath on the balcony behind him, how still it was, it was watching him, waiting, but after taking down a giant killer bird he knew he could win against the dog, glancing behind Amunet he saw Tawarete, her arms crossed cover her breasts, leaning against the wall as she looked Amunet up and down, suddenly appearing at Alex&#39;s side scratching her hippo chin &quot;I would forgive her, despite what she&#39;s done I feel that she can be redeemed, besides, another of the gods, I don&#39;t know who is looking for a new Avatar, having a bond with this woman may allow me to persuade them to take her as their host&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Alex took this into account, appart from the upside of having another god to help in this new world, Amunet was really beautiful, and given enough love he reckoned she could grow into a truly kind person, he wanted her, so his mind was made up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Verry well, but I have two conditions, firstly, that you will take me as your husband, and let me rule beside you as an equal, and secondly, is that you allow me to make you pregnant, my goddess draws power from pregnancy, plus, every pharao needs a strong heir do they not&quot; said Alex, his fingers now gently cerressinv her cheek, Amunet, looked up at him, her eyes wide before she smiled a genuine warm  loving smile, putting her hand over his as she pushed her head into his touch, kissing his palm before wrapping her arms around his neck, pulling him into a warm kiss &quot;deal my love&quot; she Moaned into his mouth as Alex lifted her up and walked over to her bed.<br />
____________________________________________<br />
Alex smiled at the memory of that day, gently cerressing her sleeping face, wiping her hair away with his thumb and gently kissing her forehead, before he heard the familiar sound of heavy footsteps echoing through the room, looking through the silk curtains he saw the silhouette of Tawarete beckon him before walking out onto the balcony.<br />
<br />
Alex as slowly and gently as he could got up from the bed, glancing to check he hadn&#39;t woken Amunet, and walked out onto the balcony, his bare body open to the elements, not that he cared, it was dark, plus it wasn&#39;t anything Tawarete hadn&#39;t seen before, after all she made his new body, Alex leaned on his elbows on the balcony rail, looking out to the shadows and torches of the city, soon to be his city to help rule over.<br />
<br />
&quot;A fine show today Alex, beating the greate crane, and creating a union between yourself and the Pharao of all people, and here I thought her heart was made if stone, would be bad for her in the underword if that had been the case&quot; she said with a light giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure she can be cold, but I get the feeling that there&#39;s something warmer underneath, like this cold and cruel personality is just a shell, one I intend to crack&quot; said Alex as he looked over at Tawarete &quot;so tell me, which God is looking for a new avatar? And how will we know if Amunet is chosen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s simple really, remember that stone statue that was in your hand, well that&#39;s kind of like our stamp of approval, or a seal if you will, once a person we have chosen holds it in their hand they will become our new avatar, its almost like a doorway to pass our power onto mortals&quot; she said with a grin, Alex looked deep in thought &quot;so will this statue just show up in one spot, or will it follow her around untill she picks it up&quot; he asked, Tawarete just shrugged &quot;how should I know, the statues choose the mortal, us gods are just alone for the ride&quot;.<br />
<br />
Alex let out a sigh, but stoped dead as he heard a groan from the bed, looking over to see Amunet stretching out her limbs before falling flat once again, so she was a restless sleeper, something to look forward to he thought with a grin before he turned to Tawarete.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you know how your the goddess of pregnancy, could you tell me if....if it- well if&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;ve hit the mark, done the deed, made the magic? Yeah I can tell you if she&#39;s carrying&quot; said Tawarete with a wink, her ears flapping happily as she ducked under the archway and reappeared at the side of the bed and held her hands out infront of her, Alex simply stayed in place, watching and waiting, his nerves on edge.<br />
<br />
Tawarete then reappeared at Alex&#39;s side &quot;congratulations your majesty&quot; she said with a giggle before disappearing, leaving Alex stunned, his mouth opening and closing like a fish &quot;YOU CANT JUST TELL SOMEONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN PISS OFF!!!!&quot; Alex yelled into the night, only hearing a faint mischievous giggle in the wind....</p>
