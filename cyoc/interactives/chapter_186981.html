<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff saw his stats shift to one of a Halfling&#39;s, albeit not a very impressive one. It made sense, given that the vast majority of folk living in a fantasy world were not glorious adventurers or mighty kings, and instead normal people living on farms. Jeff found his surroundings transforming into that of a rustic kitchen, albeit one much too small for him. The teen&#39;s head brushed against the ceiling, and the countertop barely reached above his knees. A pushing sensation soon followed, causing Jeff to shrink and everything in the room to get proportionally bigger. When the shrinking stopped, Jeff stood with the countertop just above his waist, and was able to view out the window of the kitchen, seeing a small fenced-in yard overgrown by many plants along the border.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt another pushing sensation, this time coming from inside of his body, pushing out from his bones. Fat swelled up underneath his skin, and Jeff gained quite a bit of a heft. This change made sense, given that Halflings were generally sedentary, and had a good love of food. Smells wafted through the air, and Jeff turned his head to see a pot over a hearth, clearly full of the family&#39;s next meal. The next change was odd, as all of Jeff&#39;s body hair disappeared, leaving only smooth and soft skin behind. Confused, Jeff wondered if Halflings were somehow known for their lack of body hair? He wasn&#39;t the biggest fantasy fan in the world, so he guessed that it was certainly possible in some setting.<br />
<br />
The next change, however, Jeff knew wasn&#39;t normal for Halflings of any sort. His arms slimmed down a bit, still quite hefty with fat, yet smaller than normal. His hands followed suit, his fingers slimming down a bit while gaining callouses inherent to rural living, and his fingernails becoming shiny and well groomed while lengthening a bit. Staring at his hands, Jeff desperately hoped that what he was seeing wasn&#39;t real, and that this was just an odd quirk of the randomization. The teen&#39;s hope was quickly crushed, however, as his legs shifted mass, his thighs swelling more than his calves. Jeff felt his hips push outwards, cracking as the widened and shifted, being perfect for child-bearing.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s face was the next to change, as he felt his skull shift, with his chin becoming more rounded, and lips plumping up as his nose shrank and turned slightly upwards. His eyes widened, and his eyelashes grew outwards while his eyebrows thinned. Jeff&#39;s hair pushed out, curling as it did so, draping down to his shoulders. A tickling sensation formed in Jeff&#39;s throat, and the teen was launched into a coughing fit, with each successive cough becoming higher and higher in pitch, until Jeff was left with a woman&#39;s voice as his throat was slimmed. Seeing a bucket of water on the counter, Jeff quickly scrambled over to it, and saw an unfamiliar and undeniably female face staring back at him.<br />
<br />
Beginning to stress out, Jeff started hyperventilating, leaning his back against the counter for support. The teen moaned as he felt his crotch begin to change, inversing itself. Jeff&#39;s manhood was sucked back into his body, and his testes became ovaries as his new female reproductive system formed. Jeff whimpered as he slowly moved his hand down to his crotch, feeling the void that now resided there. His chest then began to swell, pushing out into a pair of breasts, large due to the amount of excess fat that already existed on his body. Unfamiliar with the jiggling motions on his chest as he breathed, Jeff was brought to the brink of tears as he took stock of his situation. He was a Halfling woman now, and he was presumably the matriarch of the household. However, what Jeff didn&#39;t know was that the changes were not over yet. His new female reproductive system was put into use, with his stomach pushing out and stretching, as a fetus formed in his womb.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Oh!&quot; Jeff squeaked in his high-pitched voice, placing his hands on top of his stomach, feeling the baby kick once. His clothes shifted from what they once were, becoming a brown dress with a white apron over top of it, while his socks and shoes disappeared, leaving him barefoot.</p>
