<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was now Sunday. Yesterday was still fresh in your mind. Seeing your former mother naked, getting caught in the shower and what not. But the worst part was the shame you felt. Cathy clearly was equally ashamed, as you more or less didn&#39;t say a thing to each other since lunch. The flirting! Why did the two of you flirt? It was so far the weirdest thing that had happened since you became your father. And you even liked it, until Mariah came into the kitchen and made you realize what you were doing. Luckily Mariah hadn&#39;t noticed. <br />
<br />
It had to be the fact you were indeed in your father&#39;s body that did it. That you were Steve, not in mind, but at the very least in body. There was no other explanation. Hopefully this was a one time thing and you&#39;d soon forget the whole thing ever happened. The upside is that now, now, you knew. You knew you had to be careful. <br />
<br />
You had woken up early, so you had checked on Brad. Brad was awoken as you came into the room. He woke up quickly, with the vigor only a small child had. He had cartoons to watch so no time to dilly-dally. &quot;Daddy, I need the potty&quot; he begged you. You helped him on to the toilet and after a while he shouted &quot;I&#39;m done&quot;. You wiped his bottom and got him dressed. Brad ran downstairs and put on the TV.<br />
<br />
As you walked by the room you had once called your own, you could hear the new David whisper something. You leaned up against the door and listened. &quot;Yeah, Yeah, I&#39;ll ask them. I&#39;ll tell them we&#39;re going to study.&quot; he whispered. You wondered who he was talking to. You decided to knock on the door. &quot;Son, you awake&quot; you said, not to loudly. You hated calling him son but yet, you just did. &#39;David&#39; opened the door. It was weird looking down on him. It had started to feel more and more foreign that the body of the young boy had been yours. &quot;Great timing&quot; he said, holding his phone. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll ask him now&quot; he said into the device. &quot;Um, could I bring a friend over today? To study.&quot; <br />
he asked. &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t you be allowed to bring a friend over?&quot; You asked. He had not seen the new David be this timid about something before. It felt... weird. Made you feel a little too much like the father. Even if you now were his father. It was just weird knowing the roles had been reversed a few weeks ago. &quot;Well, this one is a girl.&quot; he said. That explained why he was so timid about it. He wanted to bring a girl home. &quot;Sure... Fine. But... Too be honest, you should probably ask your mother as well&quot; you said. &quot;Will do&quot; he replied as he scuttered of towards the master bedroom. <br />
<br />
With that, you went downstairs to make breakfast. Soon you were joined by David and Catherine. &quot;Good morning , Honey&quot; She said. &quot;It smells lovely&quot;. David looked pleased, so you figured he&#39;d gotten permission to bring the girl over. You hadn&#39;t noticed, but you were no longer being hesitant to call him David, even in your own mind. Guess he was winning, you were more and more accepting the fact he was David now. You had more or less accepted that you were Steve as well. Looking in the mirror in the mornings you no longer found yourself reacting to that this body greeted you. It was normal now. You couldn&#39;t help think that if you woke up as David again, tomorrow, that you&#39;d not feel at home in that flesh. You weren&#39;t fully comfortable with this body, yet, but your mental picture of you were definitely not David anymore. Something you had noticed very well when you masturbated. The mantra had worked in it&#39;s own twisted way because picturing yourself fucking a woman entailed you picturing your large hairy gut and girthy penis. Not David&#39;s hairless body and smaller package.<br />
<br />
You and Cathy was still a bit embarrassed over yesterday so you didn&#39;t talk that much during breakfast. Before you knew it, it was almost lunch and someone rang the doorbell. It was David&#39;s friend. You recognized her. You had a crush on her before all of, well, this. She was a pretty redhead with freckles and she wore glasses. Straight A student so you and her wasn&#39;t really hanging in the same circles. But apparently the new David wasn&#39;t bothered by that. But even thought you knew you used to have a crush on her you only thought about her as pretty in the sense you&#39;d think Mariah was pretty. So more in the sense of a daughter. Not in the sense that you felt any sexual attraction towards her. That was quite the somber realization.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Let&#39;s go upstairs&quot; he said. The girl, named Clara, giggled and followed him up the stairs into David&#39;s room. You felt your gut wrenching. &quot;They&#39;re not going to study, are they?&quot; You asked Cathy. &quot;I don&#39;t think so&quot; she sighed, as a mother that didn&#39;t approve of how her son spent her time. &quot;Are you fine?&quot; You asked. &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I be? I&#39;ve braced myself since we knew about the experiment. I have kind of accepted that the boy that just ran upstairs might have BEEN my husband, but he&#39;s merely my son.&quot; She said as she approached you. &quot;How are you holding up, hubby?&quot; She said as she put her arms on your shoulders while looking up at you with her large blue eyes. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m holding up. It&#39;s just weird, you know?&quot; You said. You were actually quite fine with David bringing a girl over. What bothered you was that you knew he just wouldn&#39;t shut up about it and of course he&#39;d keep flaunting it in your face, later. <br />
<br />
You and Cathy hanged out in front of the TV with Brad for a while, Lucas and Mariah was out, so things very relatively calm. Yet again you found yourself stealing glances at your former-mother,-now-wife&#39;s, large chest. K-cups? That&#39;s insane, you thought to yourself. Without thinking about it, both you and Cathy had moved closer and closer together in the sofa. Soon Cathy had her hand on your chest as you wrapped your arm behind her. All while you stole glances at her massive tits. You could again feel yourself grow hard and with that you realized the position you were in. You quickly stood up and said &quot;Honey, I&#39;ll go check in on David&quot;. You couldn&#39;t help think how natural it was to call her Honey. With that, Cathy seemingly realized the position you had just been in herself, as her face turned red. &quot;Why don&#39;t I join you? She asked. The idea was to get away from her but you couldn&#39;t say no.<br />
<br />
You went upstairs to check on David. You didn&#39;t hear anything from the room, so rather than knocking you decided for some gold old fashion spying. Cathy right behind you. You slowly opened the door to only leave a crack open. You peeked inside. What you saw made you back away from the door in shock. Cathy got curious and decided to have a look for herself. There David and Clara was on the bed, making out. Clara seemed impressed by David&#39;s expertise. Well, he might be a 16 year old boy right now, but he had been his own father just a few weeks ago. <br />
<br />
Cathy also backed away from the door. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; She asked. You were ready for this. But it was still shocking to see your old body make out with a girl. It felt so wrong, as well. Clara thought she was with a 16 year old boy and by all means, she was. But David wasn&#39;t a normal 16 year old, now was he? You looked down at your body. The body David had been in just a little while ago. The body of a 40 year old man, with a fat gut and hairy ass. Now he was 16, skinny and making out with a teenage girl. From the looks of it, he enjoyed it a lot. It was disgusting. <br />
<br />
Cathy tried to calm you down &quot;Look, he&#39;s 16. He is going to want to make out with girls his age. It&#39;s perfectly normal&quot; she said, but it seemed like she was trying to convince herself just as much as she was trying to convince you. <br />
<br />
You went back downstairs to cool yourself off. After a couple of hours, Clara and David came back downstairs and David sent her home. Both of them with huge grins plastered across their faces. David turned to you and said &quot;She&#39;s really cute, right, dad?&quot; with his now trademarked smug look. &quot;Although I guess it&#39;d be a bit weird for a man your age to find her cute.&quot; He taunted you. With that, he ran back upstairs and locked his door.</p>
