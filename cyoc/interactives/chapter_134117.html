<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>A dog in a man&#39;s body, what can go wrong?</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Chad could check any further, Carl keyed another message on the table, &quot;Come here, boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s pupils dilated.  He stiffened to attention. He had the wherewithal to copy the files to a USB drive, but then he bolted from the office and his house.  He ran two blocks to Carl&#39;s home.  He passed the front door, and ran up the drive to the back porch.  He froze when he saw the new dog door.  He looked at the back door bell, the back door, and then the dog door.  He was confused as to whether he should use the dog door or knock or ring the bell.  He raised his arm.  Looked again. Lowered his arm, and took a step toward the dog door.<br />
<br />
The back door opened, it was Carl.  He leaned against the door frame and smirked.  He was barefoot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take off your shoes, and leave them on the porch, boy.  Then come up to my room,&quot; Carl said.  He started to go back in the house leaving the door open, and then thought better of it.  He stuck his head back out as Chad was removing his other shoe, and added, &quot;And close the back door after you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad nodded vigorously. <br />
<br />
Chad entered the back door, cutting through the mud room, and into the kitchen.  He had closed the door behind him, after setting his shoes on the porch in front of the dog door.   He was sure that he had never been in Carl&#39;s house before, but he seemed to know where to go. Most people looking for a bedroom would explore the ground floor or go upstairs, but Chad headed for the closed door under the stairs, and went down to the basement.  He was as surprised, as he was certain that Carl&#39;s bedroom was in the basement.   The basement had a finished rec room with Foosball table, big screen TV, sofa, recliner, and what looked like a sauna next to the laundry room.  There was a door beyond them that was ajar. Chad headed straight for it.  Should he just go in?  Well, that&#39;s what his master said to do.<br />
<br />
So he entered timidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you&#39;re a good boy.  Now sit!&quot; said Carl.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s butt hit the floor.  His knees were bent, and his hands were on the floor between his feet.<br />
<br />
Carl laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, only a few weeks of obedience training, and you&#39;ve got it down pat,&quot; said Carl. He watched Chad for his response.  Chad&#39;s eyes, and mouth twitched, but he remained in the same position, and was silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, heh, okay, Chad, you can speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why couldn&#39;t I speak? What have you done to me?  Why am I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet boy!&quot; snapped Carl. &quot;Calm down, I had planned on you being a dog now, and not human, so I proceeded with your obedience training, and I have to say, your brother Thad knows his stuff about training dogs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad whined softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you can speak, Chad, but don&#39;t yap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Thad trains police dogs?&quot; Chad said in a confused tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I&#39;m headed to the Police Academy next year.  I plan to be a K-9 Cop.  Well, a dog handling policeman, you&#39;ll be my canine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;  Chad stared.  He wanted to argue, but he knew Carl would just quiet him, so he had to choose his words carefully.  &quot;Why did you want me to come over here?  And would you mind if I sat on a chair or stood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two good questions.  I&#39;ll answer the second first, no.  When we&#39;re alone, you&#39;re my dog.  If someone else is around, and I tell you to sit, then you can use a chair, but when we&#39;re alone, you act like a dog, understand, boy?&quot; Carl asked.  Chad nodded somberly. Carl smiled and continued, &quot;Now as for your first question, there are several answers. First, I wanted to see how well Thad trained you? And that&#39;s darn near perfect- oh, wait.  Have you used the toilet today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad thought for a moment. Then he made a disgusted face,  &quot;I drank some water out of it after I showered, but I didn&#39;t pee or anything yet, I don&#39;t think.&quot;  He started to squirm a bit.<br />
<br />
Doing his best Monty Burns, Carl put his hand together to form a steeple, and said, &quot;Excellent. You see, Chad, I told Thad, that your previous owner had trained you to use the toilet, and I wanted to break you of that habit.  He said that I would have to be firm, and only allow you to go outdoors, or the training would fail.  Fortunately, the trees at the back of my house are very secluded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  I have to go outside? What about at school?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;ll have to get you a regular walkies schedule, otherwise use the bushes or the parking lot,&quot; Carl said, &quot;As long as we follow Thad&#39;s feeding schedule, you should poop between 6-7 each morning, and between 6-7 each night.  So you&#39;ll need to be here to do that, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad grimaced and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, boy, now go about, you can hang your clothes on one of the bushes in the backyard.  I&#39;ll be right behind you, &quot; Carl snickered, as he displayed a pooper scooper and a plastic baggy.<br />
<br />
Chad muttered to himself, as he dashed upstairs and through the kitchen, &quot;I hope he has a bigger bag or more of the small ones.&quot;  He dropped to all fours, and darted out the dog door, grabbed his shoes, and bounded across the grass to the overgrown bushes and trees.  He didn&#39;t recall taking off his clothing, he wondered if that was part of his edited memory, or if he was just too focused on his paper training to pay attention to anything else.   He was panting softly, as he raised one leg to aim his penis at the tree and started to piss.    He heard Carl approach through the trees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, Chad,&quot; he said, as Chad lowered his leg.  Then he ordered,  &quot;Now poopsies!&quot;<br />
<br />
POOPSIES!  the command exploded in his head.  Chad immediately squatted, leaned forward and pushed.   He got up and examined his poop closely, he smiled proudly, sniffed his own hot shit, definitely too big for that little baggy.  He pranced on all fours toward his master.  A wet nap wiped his bum, as his master cleaned Chad&#39;s ass.  The expression on Carl&#39;s face was priceless, he wanted to maintain Chad&#39;s canine training, but he really must not have considered what that meant for him as the owner.  He struggled to load the three large turds into the baggy he brought, but fortunately, he had more in his pocket.  He managed to divide it into only two baggies, and put all the stuff in the trash.  Chad wandered around naked on all fours sniffing the trees, and bushes.  An image of a Siamese cat formed in his mind. Could he really smell that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Get dressed, Chad, we&#39;re going to school,&quot; Carl announced. <br />
<br />
Chad dressed, put his shoes on, and then ran on two legs from the bushes to where Carl was waiting next to his bicycle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can carry my backpack,&quot; Carl said, then he asked, &quot;Where&#39;s your backpack, Chad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At home, did you want me to bring it?&quot; he said uncertainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll go by your house on the way to school.  Put whatever you will need in your backpack, and come back down. You can wear both backpacks, as you run alongside my bicycle, boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad nodded happily.  He liked to run.  He was a good boy.</p>
