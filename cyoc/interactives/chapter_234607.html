<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now there was something I didn’t see every day, I recognize this boy and girl as a couple but for the love me, I couldn’t remember where. The boy look like a sophomore at the age of 16 years old, 5‘6“ tall, and his costume is in theme of the devil. In all honesty, he looks like a mishmash of clothing that was red with devil horns, tail, and a trident. Couldn’t really tell his hair color from this distance and the fact that it was covered.<br />
<br />
The girl on the other hand was surprising. She was a senior of 18 years old who is 5‘8“ tall with blonde hair and blue eyes whose costume was Angel theme. Complete with halo and wings but her outfit look like a white one piece bathing suit as well as wearing white shoes. Also not that I was noticing but despite the fact that her outfit was constricting her bust seemed to be a B-cup. <br />
<br />
“How about we have this lovely couple come up?” I announce as I pointed to the couple. They got up and as I noticed as they made their way up here is that the boy was giving extravagant bows as if he’s the main show. His girlfriend looked annoyed at his antics and just continue walking forward. Soon they reached the stage and I shook the girlfriend’s hand first.<br />
<br />
“Welcome on stage.” I said, as I stop, shaking the girlfriends hand and starts shaking the boys hand.<br />
<br />
“Good to be here, especially since our deal worked out.” The devil dress boy said. There was an awkward silence in the audience. “You know deal with the devil you’ve got powers because of me.” There was even more silence. “Geez tough crowd.” <br />
<br />
“I keep telling you, Marcus, you are not funny.” The girl said before turning towards me. “I’m Heidi by the way.”<br />
<br />
“I am too funny!” Marcus stated as a matter of fact tone. Heidi snorted at this remark.<br />
<br />
“You’re an immature, unfunny brat. Name three time you got to make people laugh.”<br />
<br />
“My prank call at the restaurant a couple days ago.”<br />
<br />
“You cause so much confusion and were banned from there in order to avoid being sued.”<br />
<br />
“That prank I pulled at the park a few weeks ago with the painting leaves and pulled branch.”<br />
<br />
“You pissed off a businessman and was nearly sued.”<br />
<br />
“The joke I made at your mom‘s birthday party a month ago.”<br />
<br />
“All of my family was horrified and we nearly broke up because of that.” Heidi said, stomping her to make a point. “You know it was because of me that we are still together and you are not in so much trouble.” Okay so those two relationship is on the rocks. Already I have a trick in mind, one that will get rid of this annoying kid and also help that could help get rid of Blair. I made a ‘timeout’ hand signal.<br />
<br />
“Okay to calm down and face the audience.” I said, and they followed my instructions. I put my hand into my pocket and wish for something and pulled out a black thread. I turn towards Heidi. “Hold out your left hand ring finger, please.” I instructed.<br />
<br />
Heidi did as she was told, and I started to wrap her ring finger with the thread. When it was done, I began pulling out the rest of the thread out of my pocket and as it for comedic effect, it was very very long. Finally, I reached the other end of the thread and turned towards the Marcus.<br />
<br />
“Now you hold out your right hand ring finger.” I instructed Marcus, but he hold up his right hand and flipped me his middle finger. I bet it was too enlisted a laugh from the audience, but still silence. “Ha ha. Now your ring finger please.” I instructed and Marcus pull back his middle finger and extended out his ring finger. I proceeded to wrap the ring finger in the other end of the thread.<br />
<br />
When it was done, the thread turned white but I didn’t elaborate further as I took two sheets and place one over Heidi was a bit difficult due to the cardboard wing she had on her back. After that, I easily placed other sheet over Marcus and I just smiled at how easy it was. I got between the two of them and picked up the thread, presenting it to the audience in my hand with the ring. I silently wish that the next wish that was made by the person this thread was connected to become reality while I was holding it with my hand with the ring finger, and the result would be it would disappear as well.<br />
<br />
“Now this thread is supposed to symbolize the red string of fate that connect lovers. As you can see, it is now white, which symbolizes that their relationship is open to be anything they wish it to be. If they want to stay together, they could or they could just break up.” I emphasize with the audience.<br />
<br />
“Breaking up is fine by me I wouldn’t dare spend anymore time with this immature boy.” Heidi said from underneath the sheet. Marcus turned to the source of The Voice since he was covered in a sheet.<br />
<br />
“Will you get off my damn case sometimes you act like my mother.” Marcus says, however, Heidi also turned to the source of Marcus voice, since she was also covered in a sheet.<br />
<br />
“You know what I wish I was your mother, that way I would raise you properly and be respectable.” Heidi shouted, and I smiled because she basically met all the requirements to make the wish. However, I put my acting skills to the test as the white thread turned gold and disappeared. Heidi seem to grew a few inches and her figure seem to have changed. Meanwhile, Mark is practically collapsed into himself underneath the sheet until there was a small wiggling mass in the center. <br />
<br />
I looked confused at what just happened as how you started looking around as if she was trying to get her bearings. The audience looked at me in shocked at the fact that I seem so confused.<br />
<br />
“Okay folks I did not expect one sheet to pull in something so small while the other pulled in something so big.” I said which the audience look at me confused as if I went off script. I grabbed the two sheets and looked towards the audience. “Let’s see who I pulled in.” I said, as I pulled the sheets off the two.<br />
<br />
Marcus was now a-year-old baby in a diaper and an odd top half that resembled a devil. Heidi grew four inches and was now 6 foot tall. Her hips widen a bit and her bust grew a size that if I bet if they were unrestrained, they would be d-cups. Heidi now look like she aged a bit because her body just screamed MILF but she look so young. Heidi looked around for a bit confused of where she was before spotting Marcus on the ground and she rushed to pick him up.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on?” Heidi asked. “How did I get here?” She then looked into the audience and seemed to have spotted Mrs. Brockman, and look as if she recognized her.<br />
<br />
“That is my fault I was performing a trick to make two people appear and for some strange reason I pulled you and your son from somewhere.” I said as I moved in front of her to get her attention.<br />
<br />
“I was in the mansion nursery putting my little Marcus to sleep.” Heidi said and confusion.<br />
<br />
“Interesting if you don’t mind answering a few questions my name is Joey. I’m the magician for Brad‘s birthday party. Who are you and what are you doing in the Brockman mansion?” I asked in confusion but eventuality it was to have Heidi re-introduce herself.<br />
<br />
“My name is Heidi Fallon, I’m one of the maid staffed here and I’ve been working here for a year. I am 25 years old and have a son as you can see.” Heidi said calming down.<br />
<br />
“25? With a kid already?” I asked in confusion.<br />
<br />
“Yeah to graduating from college I made a stupid mistake by having sex with my boyfriend on the night of our graduation.” She said somberly. “My ex-boyfriend, just moved to the other end of the country and practically forgot about me. Despite the fact I told him about the baby.”<br />
<br />
“Ouch, a rough time to have a kid. Just graduating from college and you should’ve been focused on finding a job.” I commented.<br />
<br />
“Yeah but Mrs. Brockman is a saint. She hired me provided a place for me to stay with my kid. Plus, given that she has a grandkid; my son is a perfect playmate for him.” Heidi said.<br />
<br />
“Why are you dressed like that because I’m pretty sure if you were on duty, you would be in your maid outfit?” I asked. Heidi just shrugged her shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Technically it was my day off, but Mrs. Brockman invited to our son’s birthday party but emphasize that I had had to dress up because it was a costume party and I can bring my kid.” Heidi answered, and I smiled because now I can work with this as if this was always part of my act.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I see she must’ve realized that I would try to pull someone out of thin there and figured better have someone on standby. Sorry about that.” I apologized for turning to address the audience. “Give it up for Heidi and her son Marcus.” <br />
<br />
The audience start applauding as if to play along, and I motion for Heidi to take a seat in the audience. She left a stage with her son, Marcus and took a seat right next to Mrs. Brockman. As soon as the applause die down, I took an a breath.<br />
<br />
“Now that that’s all the way I will now need two volunteers.” I announce as a lot of hands shot up. “However my volunteers have to be a boy and a girl, and they must be open-minded to walk a mile in each other shoes.” I said, and many put down their hands. However, there were still a lot for me to choose from for the next trick.</p>
