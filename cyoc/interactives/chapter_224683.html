<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>A little world building: In this branch of the story, we will do away with the whole wizard/muggle divide. Anyone can do a little magic. Some are better at magic than others just like some are better at athletics than others, hence Stonewood is a school for those who are more talented in magic. But even the least magical person in this world can perform a spell or two if they read it in a book or use an amulet.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hank said, &quot;I&#39;m really sick of everyone calling me the janitor. First of all, the actual janitor is Floyd. He&#39;s the one who mops the floors and cleans the bathrooms. Second, I&#39;m the maintenance man, the fixit guy, the handyman. Yes I am the one who unclogs the toilet when needed but I also do repairs everywhere else in this school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Professor MacGuffin said, &quot;Whatever, will you please clean this student up and make him presentable?&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin, the living chair, blushed.<br />
<br />
Hank said, &quot;I&#39;ll do you one better. It looks a little wobbly. I do have some magic tools that I can use to not only clean it up but to stiffen it up, make it stronger, better able to do it&#39;s job as a chair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Professor MacGuffin said, &quot;Thank you. Now Justin, chair, remember what I told you. You must be a chair. You are no longer human for the rest of the school year. You are an it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin said, &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; He absolutely did not want to go back to his parents and let his parents think of him as a failure.<br />
<br />
Professor MacGuffin left. Hank grabbed something that looked like a magical tricorder. He used it to scan Justin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this does not look good. You have two magical forces mashed together controlling your form. Now you said, that Mento transformed you into a chair and then you used your own magic in an attempt to become human again, is that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I cannot undo either magic. You are stuck as a part chair, part human. I can still make some minor changes but you will remain part chair, part human for I don&#39;t know how long. I don&#39;t know why Professor MacGuffin  decided on a year. The magic controlling your form could wear off in a month or last the rest of your life. When you have two competing magics mashed together like that, there is no way to determine how long either will last.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin, hung his head. &quot;How can I go on living as a chair? My life is over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be fine. We have plenty of non-humans here at this school. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll help you plan a life for yourself. Now first I&#39;m going to remove your hair permanently. Your seat cushion should have a fur but the rest of you should be smooth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank grabbed Justin&#39;s cock and balls and began rubbing an amulet all over them. The amulet warmed and vibrated Justin&#39;s cock and it hardened.<br />
<br />
Hank said, &quot;I wish I could get rid of these for you. Chair&#39;s shouldn&#39;t have genitals but your magical mashing is preventing me from getting rid of your genitals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank continued rubbing the amulet all over Justin&#39;s body. Justin watched in a nearby mirror as he looked more and more freakish. His genitals were even more noticeable without hair to hide behind and not only that but the skin of his genitals looked rawer like a sex toy, not like human genitals.<br />
<br />
Then Hank got to work on stiffening Justin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still want to be able to move. Don&#39;t make me so stiff I can&#39;t move.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m just making you stronger so you can hold people up better.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Hank finished, Justin looked in the mirror. He looked like a very elegant chair. He was a nice smooth pink all over. It was a flesh tone pink but it no longer looked like flesh. His arms and legs still had the shape of arms and legs and he could even still use his hands like hands but it looked like his arms and legs had been carved out of a pink wood. His face was still imprinted on the back rest cushion. He still had his ass, his cock and his balls but they too looked artificial and firmer like silicone sex toys. In fact, his cock seemed even bigger and permanently erect. It rose up from the front of his seat and Justin immediately realized that someone could sit in his chair form and ride his cock using him like a sex toy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, no, no no. You&#39;ve turned me into a sex toy. I don&#39;t want to be a sex toy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank said, &quot;I did the best I could do. It&#39;s your own fault. You messed up when you tried to counter Mentor&#39;s magic with your own. But don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll make sure everyone knows you are a chair, not a sex toy, and that your dildo is not to be used.&quot; Hank bent Justin&#39;s dildo cock as he said that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank continued to play with Justin&#39;s dildo cock. &quot;You&#39;re going to have to get used to it. You may be a chair, not a sex toy, but as a chair, you have no say in how you are touched or used. You are an object. I think the best that you can hope for is that people keep their clothes on while they use you, okay? Now thank me for stiffening you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin gulped as Hank continued playing with Justin&#39;s stiffened dildo cock. &quot;Thank you for stiffening me up, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Professor MacGuffin came back but Hank kept playing with Justin&#39;s stiffened dildo cock. Although the intensity kept rising, it felt like release was impossible, like Justin was forced to experience arousal without end.<br />
<br />
Professor MacGuffin said, &quot;I spoke with Professor Grail who is in charge of Inanimate Studies and he expressed concern about your academic career. He is very happy that you are so interested in Inanimate Studies that you would turn yourself into a chair but he wants to make sure that you can also attend your other classes. Therefore, he has taken charge of you. He is going to be the one directing your activities here at Stonewood from now on. He is making some changes to what I planned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Professor MacGuffin continued, &quot;First, he says that you should be allowed to use the word I. He says that referring to yourself in the third person is absurdly awkward and not helpful. But he still wants you to identify yourself as a chair and adopt the mentality of a chair. Whatever rules apply to chairs applies to you. He told me to have you repeat after me. He wants you to say, &#39;I am a chair.&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin sighed, &quot;I am a chair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Professor MacGuffin made Justin repeat himself three times.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a chair. I am a chair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Professor MacGuffin said, &quot;Professor Grail is also going to try to establish communication with Mentor. That is risky because Mentor tends to turn everyone he meets inanimate. Mentor isn&#39;t malicious. He just assumes that everyone wants to be inanimate. But Professor Grail knows Mentor well enough that Grail believes he can get Mentor to cooperate.&quot;</p>
