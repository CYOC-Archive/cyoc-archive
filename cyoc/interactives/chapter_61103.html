<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This cannot be possible, the great Goddess would not have allowed a man to bear her power...&quot; Arianna said, <br />
becoming quite flustered, staring at you with disbelief as she began to pace backwords and forewords, &quot;I <br />
must...I must consult with the other sisters, they will see through this obvious lie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lie?&quot; you questioned, a little upset be the accusation, &quot;I'm not lying!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please be silent, I must call our sisters from their slumber so we may discover the truth of this matter,&quot; <br />
she told you, stopping suddenly and clasping her hands together, withdrawing into some sort of meditative <br />
state. You watched as she closed her eyes and began to chant, the words soft and unheard by you, more mouthed <br />
than sung, wondering what the hell she was doing and where exactly these other &quot;sisters&quot; were going to appear <br />
from. Only moments later did you find out, as you witnessed the effects of her chanting; the exquisitely <br />
sculpted statues seeming to glow a brilliant white as from their depths, an entire legion of equally young and <br />
beautiful woman began to appear, their forms ghostly and transparent, gradually turning solid, till you were <br />
surrounded in the small temple by what looked to be over 100 of them, all neatly packed in a circle around <br />
you.<br />
<br />
“Wow...” you smirked as your eyes quickly moved from one face to the other, each girl appearing just as hot as <br />
the one before, never having been in one place with so many gorgeous woman before. As you did, one of them, <br />
tall with golden blond hair and piercing blue eyes then stepped forward, apparently speaking for the others as <br />
she said in the same soft, unearthly tone, &quot;We are here sister Arianna and you have brought the new champion <br />
before us I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Illyana, this is she,” Arianna replied, bowing her head slightly in seeming reverence, this Illyana chick <br />
obviously being in charge, “ The one we have long waited for, the one who shall carry on our legacy and heal <br />
the hurts of the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we welcome you noble sister,” Illyana smiled as she stepped towards you, bowing her own head as the <br />
others quickly followed her example. “Tell me what is your name?&quot; she asked, holding out a hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...Simon,” you nervously replied, feeling more than a little intimidated, “but I'm uh, I’m no sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She says that she is not a woman, that she is a man transformed,” Arianna interjected, looking to the other <br />
woman with questioning eyes, “But that is preposterous isn’t it? Athena would not let such an error occur.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were beginning to get more than a little frustrated by nobody believing your story and interrupting rather <br />
bluntly you told her, &quot;Well obviously she has, ‘cause I might look like a chick now, but I'm definitely a <br />
guy,” holding up your ID card again, this time for Illyana’s benefit as you pointed to your picture, “look, <br />
says it right there!&quot;<br />
<br />
A sudden murmuring and muttering then echoed around the temple walls as the sisters turned to one another in <br />
shock, seemingly just as upset by this revelation as Arianna had been. “Silence sisters!” Illyana quickly <br />
hushed them, the voices instantly stopping as an eerie silence fell over the room and Illyana’s attention <br />
returned to you, her blue eyes glaring at you suspiciously, as if you were suddenly on trial. “This tale is <br />
troubling indeed, therefore we must use the Pool of Knowledge to discover if what you say is indeed true, <br />
Simon...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let’s do that then,” you eagerly answered, feeling incredibly uncomfortable under all these watchful <br />
eyes and eager to get as far away from them as possible, “The sooner I get out of this crazy nightmare the <br />
better!&quot;<br />
<br />
Guiding you back round to face the small circular pool, Illyana then gestured towards it down towards it, <br />
telling you to &quot;Look deep into the very water of Olympus itself, that was brought here by the Goddess Athena <br />
and show us all what we seek to discover, show us your true self; Simon Blake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Assuming that this must be some sort of magical pool you decided to go along with it, staring deeply into the <br />
clear blue water, watching in amazement as its surface began to shimmer and shift, images appearing from its <br />
depths almost as if you were looking into some kind of weird mirror. You saw your life quickly flash across <br />
the water; you as a baby then a kid, your life in high school, then college, finding the ring outside the <br />
English department, until finally a large collective gasp echoed around the room as the water changed one last <br />
time showing very clearly the reflection of the person staring into it; you, not as a woman but as the scrawny <br />
18 year old geek you had once been.<br />
<br />
“It cannot be!” a voice cried out, followed by several more similar comments, “This is...is impossible!” “It <br />
is sacrilege!” “How can this be?” as ignoring them you excitedly gazed downwards at yourself hoping to see <br />
that the reflection was accurate, rather crushed to find out that you were still in a female form.<br />
<br />
“Please, calm down sisters, we do not yet know if that this was a mistake, perhaps...perhaps it was the will <br />
of Athena,” Arianna desperately cried, trying to calm the others as the temple once again fell into a nervous <br />
hush.<br />
<br />
“There has never been a male champion before Arianna, you know that. This...this boy is an insult to our noble <br />
cause!” came Illyana’s angry reply, looking towards you with great contempt.<br />
<br />
Arianna however, continued in your defense, turning to her fellow sister and stuttering nervously, “But...but <br />
we cannot know the Goddess’s will, we should...” <br />
<br />
“We should do nothing sister!” Illyana’s scaldingly replied, causing not only Arianna to jump but you as well, <br />
the woman’s apparent rage filling the ancient room. “No man has ever set foot in this temple and no man ever <br />
shall,” she continued, backing away from you and closer to her fellow sisters, “The only course of action now <br />
is to pray to Athena and to send that...that...man (her voice seething now as she aimed her accusing finger <br />
directly at you) far from this sacred place, lest he infect us further!”<br />
<br />
“Hey, I never asked to be brought here you know,” you grumbled defensively, not particularly enjoying being <br />
the center of all this disdain, “Nor did I ask to be turned into a woman, so sending me back is just fine by <br />
me.”<br />
<br />
“Good. Then so it shall be,” were her final words before another sudden flash of warm, bright light appeared, <br />
quickly engulfing the enitre room.</p>
