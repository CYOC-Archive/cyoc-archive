<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The mysterious stranger, finished with his task in helping Eric Anderson; he moves on to his next destination. Travelling through the sub consciousness and dreamscape, the ethereal dragon’s next stop is Leon Talbot.<br />
<br />
The were-lion king was sleeping in the hospital room his son Peter was recovering in. While his son was in his fursona, Leon at the moment wasn’t; yet in the dream the were-lion was running through the African plains chasing down an Impala. The drive for fresh meat to feed his family over riding his other senses; Leon completely ignores the dragon watching him, changing into a man wearing a neatly pressed suit. Tackling the wild animal down and quickly snapping his neck; Leon roars with victory as he announces to the plains other wildlife that this kill is his.<br />
<br />
“I thought the female lion did the hunting in a pride,” the mysterious man speaking; “not the males.”<br />
“What business of it is yours,” Leon growling; “my mate and cubs need fresh meat.”<br />
“Regina and your son and daughter,” the man speaking; “are not here. This is a dream; a nice one at that, but still a dream.”<br />
“It feels so real,” Leon growling; “the smells in the air, the grass underneath my paws. The sun on my fur,” Leon looking at the man; “and you have to spoil it.”<br />
“Perhaps when I’m done talking with you,” the man chuckling; “you’ll dream of chasing down your wife and putting a cub in her eager belly.”<br />
<br />
“So what is it you want to talk about,” Leon looking un-nerved; the were-lion in his fursona watching as he sees the African Plains dissolve and change to an empty table and chair outside of café Luna. With the sun out and the day bright and cheery; the strange man sits down in an empty chair and beckons Leon to do the same.<br />
“No need to worry about violating Moon Lake’s were-laws Leon,” the man sipping an espresso; “this is a dream.”<br />
“A rather vivid one,” Leon trepidly sitting in the offered chair; “but what do you want to talk to me? And who the hell are you?”<br />
“Who I am doesn’t matter,” the man putting down his espresso; “only the message I bring. But I’m sure you know about me; I did visit Peter and kept him from dying,“ the man looking serious while flashing his draconic eyes at Leon; “so I think that warrants your undivided attention with me.”<br />
<br />
Leon, seeing the ominous reptilian slits on yellow orbs staring back at him; Leon couldn’t help but growl and snarl in defense. Feeling threatened as his fur begins to stand on end.<br />
“I’m not here to hurt you,” the man speaking; “I’m here to talk to you about this Parker fellow.”<br />
“I already have all the information I need regarding Freddie the shark,” Leon answering back; “who he is and who he employs. I know of Chelnik, Tachibana visited earlier and warned me about him, while threatening me to stay away from Freddie Parker.”<br />
“I know you weren’t exactly thrilled,” the man answering; “but Tachibana did mean what she said. She will lock you up if you confront the man.”<br />
“She can try,” Leon growling; “but it will cost her a lot of men to try and contain a raging Lion.”<br />
“You are not the only one that Freddie has pissed off,” the draconic man chuckles; “while you have yet to be told or listen to the message you wife sent you. A group of Freddie’s men decide to break into the Knight Estate. Benton wasn’t home, but his daughter Frieda was; as well as her mates and some cubs they were baby sitting.”<br />
“Fuck,” Leon cracking a toothy smile; “that must have been a mistake for them to make.”<br />
“Three of the men are dead,” The man speaking; “one is in jail and I just had to talk to a were-panther because he was distraught at having to take a human life.”<br />
“So I take it Benton is now on the warpath,” Leon rubbing his paws together in delight; “you want me to sit back while Benton goes shark hunting?”<br />
“Benton was also warned by Tachibana about Frederick Parker,” the man sighing; “yet he was able to enact some code: Omega on the mobster well before Tachibana talked to the were-panther.”<br />
“Code: Omega,” Leon looking confused; “what the hell is that?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing you need to be concerned with,” the draconic man waving the question off; “but you do need to be concerned with the fact the  motel Freddie and his men are staying at will soon be kicking them out. Freddie just got some really bad news regarding a raid in California; he is starting to feel insolvent for the first time in a long while. The man will be desperate and might just lash out.”<br />
“If he or his men try and hurt me or my family,” Leon growling; “it will be the last thing they do. I will not lay down, just because some were-vixen is more concerned with keeping this town’s secret safe then letting its citizens defend themselves accordingly.”<br />
“Just don’t go actively seeking the man out,” the man speaking to Leon; “if he attacks you, then you are justified in defending yourself. Even Tachibana cannot do anything to tie your paws in regards to that.”<br />
“Is that it,” Leon looking at the man; “you message is to tell me what I already know?”<br />
“You didn’t know about Benton striking out,” the draconic man responding; “but I do have another matter to lay on you. It is in regards to your son Peter.”<br />
<br />
Leon looks at the draconic man as he calmly sips more espresso; feeling the need to tense up, the were-lion starts to bare his fangs and let off a low menacing growl.<br />
“Tread carefully,” Leon snarling; “you may have kept my son from dying, but that doesn’t mean I won’t protect him from harm. Even from you.”<br />
“I’m not here to harm him,” the draconic man answering Leon’s growls with one of his own; the man’s shadow growing behind him and taking on a more draconic form; “so stop being defensive with me and listen. My patience with you will only go so far.”<br />
<br />
Leon recoiling in fear as the patio table and chairs of café Luna fade and the dream resumes in Peter’s hospital room.<br />
“You son has fallen for a were-rabbit,” the man voice changing; taking on a rough tone and a slight hiss. “He has fallen head over heels for his doctor; that much should be obvious to you by now.”<br />
“I’m aware,” Leon looking genuinely scared as the man morphs into his ethereal dragon form; “Helen Tompkins, but why remind me of all this?”<br />
“While your wife and daughter will accept the were-rabbit as a future in law,” the dragon now booming; “members of your pride will take exception. They will see it as a weakness in you and your son’s ability to rule and will challenge you both.”<br />
“I will fight tooth and claw against anyone who dares to challenge me for leadership of the pride,” Leon growling.<br />
“Does that include Peter,” the dragon speaking; “If you step down, the pride will not accept him as king while he has a were-rabbit mate. He will have to prove his strength and successfully challenge you for the role if he is to be the next king. I&#39;m sad to say this will happen; when I cannot say, but such is the price for his second chance at life.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon fades away, causing Leon to wake up from the chair he was sleeping in. Looking at his son Peter sleeping peacefully; Leon shudders at the thought of having to defend himself as his son fight for his right to rule.<br />
‘But what if,’ Leon looking at his son while thinking; ‘Peter doesn&#39;t want to be king?’</p>
