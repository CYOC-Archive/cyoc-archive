<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later that evening four men in their thirties sat in the living room of Brody and Steve’s home. Aaron and John both wore loose fitting tank tops and gym shorts, while Steve and Brody had neglected to get dressed after returning from their walk. John, happy to have Aaron back, sat cuddled to his boyfriend on the couch while Brody sat in a loveseat and Steve sat on the floor between his legs.<br />
<br />
“You sure you guys don’t want to take a lap around the block on all fours? You wouldn’t believe how incredible it is to sniff things with a dog’s nose” Steve paused, turning to look up at Brody, “especially another dog’s butt.”<br />
<br />
Brody laughed and leaned forward for a kiss. “Thanks babe. Your furry butt smells pretty great too.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe another time” Aaron said.<br />
<br />
“Did you want to give flying a shot tomorrow?” Brody asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah! We totally should after the gym!” Steve exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah we should!” both Aaron and John exclaimed as well, due in no small part to Steve&#39;s control over them.<br />
<br />
Brody laughed. “Well boys, I’m going to order some pizzas.” Brody said, standing from the loveseat to head upstairs to find his phone.<br />
<br />
Steve turned to the men on the couch, “So, Aaron. Any ideas of what you want to do until the pizzas get here?” They had agreed that since it was John’s idea to steal the jock that started this whole thing, Aaron would have final say in what changes they made that night.<br />
<br />
“Well, while you were picking John up, Brody mentioned that sometimes he turns you into your own penis and you ride around in his briefs. It might be kinda fun for us to ride around in your underwear.” Aaron said. John blanched at the idea.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, that is fun. Having multiple cocks can get awkward though” Steve paused. “But, I have an idea” he said with a devilish smirk.<br />
--<br />
Ten minutes later Brody came back down the stairs. “Pizzas will be here in 30 minutes!” He announced to a seemingly empty living room. “Steve? Boys?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, we’re down here babe.” Steve responded from the floor.<br />
<br />
“What are you guys...” Brody stopped as he came around the loveseat to find Steve laying prone on the floor. His dick was completely erect, his sack taut and looked to be three times the size it usually was. “Jesus, Steve. Really? I leave you alone for five minutes and you turn them into cum?”<br />
<br />
 “Hey, it was Aaron’s idea. Kind of. He said he wanted them to ride around in my underwear til the pizza got here. I didn’t want to have three cocks so,” Steve smirked, glancing down at his swollen nutsack. “I doubt these will fit in any of my briefs though” and he propped himself up on his elbows.<br />
<br />
Brody kneeled down between Steve’s legs and lightly traced his index finger along the seam of his husband’s taut ballsack, making Steve moan.<br />
<br />
“Oh God. I forgot how horny sucking a guy into my nuts makes me. It’s like I just had two reverse orgasms” Steve said, and Brody grinned at him. Lowering himself to his elbows, Brody locked eyes with Steve. Maintaining eye contact, Brody inched his face closer and closer to Steve’s crotch until he could make contact with his tongue against the hairless skin. Brody lightly licked around his husband’s swollen nutsack, making Steve squirm. “Ung, ohh, babe. Ohh, babe. Babe! Slow down! Any more of that and I’m going to shoot them right back out onto the carpet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brody sat back and laughed. “I know, but I’ve been in that sack of yours myself, and I remember how nice it is when someone gives the sack a tongue bath.”<br />
<br />
“True enough” Steve said. “Hey, we have about 25 minutes before the pizzas get here. Want to go upstairs and fuck them out of me?”<br />
<br />
“You bet babe” Brody said. He crawled up Steve’s body to give him a kiss, his own hard cock rubbing against Steve’s engorged sack.<br />
--<br />
Steve lay on his back, his ankles resting on Brody’s shoulders. Steve had wanted to ride Brody and give him a larger than life cum bath, but Brody nixed that idea since his name was on the pizzas and he wasn’t going to answer the door covered in cum. With one hand guiding his cock, he traced the outer edges of his husband’s hole. Smirking, he tapped the head of his cock on Steve’s hole three times.<br />
<br />
“Really? Every. Time?” Steve said, exasperated. <br />
<br />
“My mom taught me to always knock before I come inside” Brody said.<br />
<br />
Steve rolled his eyes. “God, you’re the worst.”<br />
<br />
Brody smiled, “And you loooooooooove me” he said, pushing his dick inside of Steve as he drew out the word “love”.<br />
<br />
“Oh, oh, ohhhhh, Oh, yeah. Fuck” Steve panted as inch by inch Brody entered him. Once completely inside, Brody moved Steve’s legs from his shoulders to his waist, and lowered himself to kiss Steve. One of Steve’s hands clasped around the back of Brody’s neck, pulling Brody into the kiss while Steve’s other hand squeezed as much of his husband’s butt cheek as he could. The fucking was tender and passionate, Brody taking slow and methodical strokes into and out of his husband as they kissed. Steve moaned into Brody’s mouth, “Oh fuck, oh yeah. Yeah babe, right there, Ohhhhhhhhhunnnnnn fuck.” Steve broke the kiss to throw his head back, and Brody took this opportunity to zone in on and suck the skin on Steve’s neck. Steve wasn’t going to last long. The combined sensation of his husband’s lips on his neck, his husband’s cock stroking his prostate, the friction of Brody’s stomach against his swollen sack, and the buzzing of the two men contained within his sack were all coalescing to drive Steve over the edge. “Oh... oh fuck! Oh, yeah. Yeah babe, right there. Oh fuck. Oh fuck Oh...” Brody leaned back up away from Steve, grabbed his ankles and spread his husband wide open. Aaron and John were ready to evacuate Steve’s balls, and there was little he could do to stop them. “Oh fuck... I’m gonna... I’m... I’m gonnnnna... CUMMING!” Steve yelled. Without touching his own cock, Steve began ejaculating a continuous stream of cum. Ounces upon ounces of semen shot from Steve’s cock, finally slowing to a trickle. “That’s... that’s one of em” Steve said, almost breathlessly. Brody smirked, and thrust hard into his husband. “FUUUUUUU....” Steve yelled as a second stream of cum started pouring out of him. By the time the second stream slowed to a trickle, Steve was absolutely covered in cum.<br />
<br />
Brody knew Steve had to be close to his own ejaculation, and seeing his husband cum like that had almost brought him over the edge. Steve lay panting, trying to catch his breath, when he caught Brody’s gaze. Brody smirked, “Our turn” and began thrusting into his husband.<br />
<br />
Ejaculating Aaron and John had been a release, but not an orgasm. The act in and of itself had left Steve extremely close. His ballsack had noticeably deflated, now filled solely with his own cum. His own cum that was about to be expelled all over his chest. Brody thrust once more, hilting himself in Steve, once again causing Steve to ejaculate without touching his cock. This time however, the orgasm and the corresponding muscles in Steve’s butt milked an orgasm out of Brody. Both man yelled out in pleasure as they came at the same time. <br />
<br />
“That... that was... that...” Steve panted.<br />
<br />
“Incredible” Brody finished, pulling out of Steve. “Babe, you’d better fix them before the dry on your chest.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, right. Alright Aaron and John, be human again.” Steve commanded.</p>
