<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, in the girl&#39;s locker room, Jennifer was getting ready for her cheer practice with the rest of the team. The eight girl squad had been exempted from today&#39;s gym class in order to prepare for the upcoming basketball peprally. <br />
<br />
Jennifer smiled to herself knowing that she had already seen what got the team excited the night before. <br />
<br />
Of course Jen knew that she was going to have to gather the team and tell them about what happened last night. <br />
<br />
&quot;Girls do you know why the team didn&#39;t seem as disappointed as they normally do after a big loss....&quot; Jennifer began the girls stood transfixed by the story of her varsity gangbang on behalf of the losing Gladiators. <br />
<br />
While Jennifer was regaling the girls with the stories of her conquests, Kyle was about to deal with his own basketball issues. <br />
<br />
Kyle was in the men&#39;s locker room after his pitiful attempts to run with his horse cock bobbing and slapping him around. He took the opportunity of near solitude to look over his drastic change in the locker room mirror. He hadn&#39;t really taken the time to study himself since the change had occurred last night. <br />
<br />
Kyle looked at his large two foot organ as it swayed pendulously between his legs. He grabbed the organ with his hand and held it in front of him in order to get a look at his leathery balls. Kyle noticed that his chest hair had become darker and more noticeable as a result of the change. He turned to the right and noticed a large gray and blue horseshoe tattoo was clearly visible on his left butt cheek. &quot;This must be a result of the reality change. When I changed people&#39;s perception of my nakedness, I had gained a desire to show off my assets.&quot; Kyle mused to himself. After flexing and posing in the mirror, Kyle turned around and once again noticed that Cory seemed to be paying too much attention to him. <br />
<br />
Jennifer finished her story by desciribing the sex coma that she has slipped into after the last of the guys had shot their loads and headed home. Her cheer teammates looked at her with mouths agape. Finally, one said, &quot;You&#39;re lying. There&#39;s no way you did all of that. You&#39;ve always been such a tease. There&#39;s no way you put out for all of them.&quot; The rest of the group nodded in agreement. <br />
<br />
Jennifer was disappointed that they refused to believe what she said was true. It felt strange for her to admit it but she was proud of what she had done, not because satisfying the 15 guys was tough but because she was proud to have been so kinky. <br />
<br />
Jennifer dropped the subject and the girls left in order to do their routines. <br />
<br />
Back in the men&#39;s locker, Kyle had grabbed his bottle of Mane n&#39; Tail and began to lather up. He heard Cory enter and turn on the faucet next to him but he paid no attention.  Kyle rinsed the soap from his eyes and turned around and Cory was standing inches from him. His 6&#39;10&quot; frame forced Kyle to look up at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your deal br—&quot; was all he could say before Cory reached down and grabbed his massive dick. Kyle took a step backwards and slipped on the tile knocking his head and causing him to see stars.<br />
<br />
Cory took this moment of incapacitation as an opportunity and used the weight of his body to hold Kyle down as he began to stoke Kyle&#39;s horse dick against his will. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get off!&quot; Kyle shouted but Cory paid no attention as he said, &quot;I didn&#39;t believe it when Jennifer told us about you after the game but after seeing you in third period, I had to know what it felt like.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Get off of me you sick fuck!&quot; Kyle protested but Cory made no motion to get up. Instead, he put his large mouth over the flared tip and began to suck. What Cory lacked in experience, he made up for in enthusiasm. His large hot mouth awakened Kyle&#39;s near constant arousal and he found himself bucking his hips trying to force himself deeper in the warm wet hole. <br />
<br />
Cory went on for what felt like hours but was probably closer to fifteen minutes. After the first few minutes, Kyle had accepted the situation and had quit fighting. There was no way he could overpower the tall football player and there wasn&#39;t any harm in this kind of horseplay. <br />
<br />
Finally, Kyle began to shoot his load. Cory did his best to swallow as much as possible but most of the cum went all over both of them as powerful jets of horse semen shot out from Kyle like a fountain. <br />
<br />
Once Kyle was spent, and lay on the cool tile panting, Cory got up on his knees and began to lift Kyles legs towards his hips. Again, Kyle was afraid. He tried to free himself but Cory was an immovable force. Cory said, &quot;It&#39;s time for the big man on campus to try and break a stallion.&quot; With that he began to try and line his sizable dick up with Kyle&#39;s virgin hole. Kyle did the only thing he could think of and said, &quot;Transform or Dare!&quot;<br />
<br />
The cheer squad had been practicing for a good thirty minutes when they all started to get sloppy with their moves. One after one, they asked to be excused to the locker room until Jennifer was the only one on the team still left on the court. <br />
<br />
Jennifer strolled into the locker room and noticed that three of the girls were standing uncomfortably near the showers while the other four had occupied the stalls. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Jennifer said with mock surprise. &quot;Is practice over? If so, let&#39;s hit the showers and get ready for fifth period.&quot; <br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s all began to disrobe slowly and head to the showers. When the first one got undressed, she gasped and said, &quot;I&#39;m a freak!&quot;</p>
