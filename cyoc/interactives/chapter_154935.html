<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Vanessa in mermaid form and cuddling up him on their bed, dozing lightly and occasionally fluttering her eyelids open to gaze at her merman lovingly, Chad briefly contemplated reaching for some heavy bit of stone or concrete decoration and bashing his captor over the head while she slept. Or, even easier, he could just take her necklace off, let her become human, and hold her down here in the salt-water until she drowned in his arms.<br />
<br />
But he just couldn&#39;t bring himself to do it. He was a kid, not a killer. Despite everything he&#39;d been through—including the entirely fucked-up fact that the fish-woman cuddled up in his arms right now was, not to mince any words, his rapist—killing a person in cold blood, even if he could justify it as self-defense, just wasn&#39;t who he was. No, thought Chad, there had to be a way for him to escape with his life, his legs, and his conscience intact. And all the better if the people who had done these vile things to him could be brought to justice.<br />
<br />
But, at the very least, here was a chance. Vanessa&#39;s pearl necklace was enchanted to turn a human being into a mermaid. Would it work in reverse? Chad had to try—he wouldn&#39;t be able to live with himself if he didn&#39;t take this opportunity. So, slowly, carefully, he reached for the pearls . . .<br />
<br />
*snort-blurp* Vanessa snored a little bit and some bubbles came out of her nose and drifted up and away. Chad, frozen with fear, waited another full five minutes, hardly daring to move or breathe, before he tried again. He laid a hand on the necklace, slowly unwound it, and then, BAM, ripped it off Vanessa&#39;s neck and put it over his own.<br />
<br />
The effects were immediate. The spell on Vanessa was broken: she instantly turned back into a human and started choking, drowning, frantically swimming up for a breath of air. Chad, meanwhile, looked down and saw to his delight that the magic was indeed reversible, and that the human-to-mer necklace also functioned as a mer-to-human charm. The power of Vanessa&#39;s witchcraft didn&#39;t totally overwhelm the more powerful effects of the skin-suit: Chad&#39;s hair and beard remained sea-green in color, and as his tail split into legs and the fins vanished, Chad noted that his legs remained covered in green scales and he didn&#39;t have any toes. (The golden bracelet he still wore ensured that his junk was still covered in skin and not scales, though.) <br />
<br />
Chad found that he too could no longer breathe under water now, although he cold hold his breath with such ease that he didn&#39;t feel the distress Vanessa did. Calm and collected, he simply swam up to the surface, climbed out of the pool, and took in a deep breath of air. &quot;GASP!&quot;<br />
<br />
When Chad breathed in, he was elated to hear the sound of his own voice. &quot;I can talk!&quot; he cried. &quot;I have my legs back and I can talk again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa, sputtering on the edge of the pool, coughed and wheezed and reached out to Chad for help. <br />
<br />
Briefly, Chad contemplated running away as fast as these weird, scaly fish-legs could carry him, leaving Vanessa to her fate. But . . . no, he couldn&#39;t do that to anyone, not even the witch. (Plus, he thought to himself wryly, he kind of looked like a naked Aquaman or Namor right now, and what kind of superhero would he be if he let a civilian die? And, oh yeah, he was still naked—which might make running down the street and trying to find his way home unduly complicated, unless he could find a towel or something around her to cover up first. But first, priorities.) Chad knelt down, helped Vanessa out of the pool, and then swatted her on the back until her lungs finally started heaving up the seawater.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neptune!&quot; she coughed. &quot;Why did you—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My *name* is Chad, you psycho-bitch turbo-cunt!&quot; he roared. &quot;I&#39;m eighteen! I go to JFK high and I have a football scholarship! Or at least I did, before Paul and those freaks at the skin-shop kidnapped me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kidnapped . . . ?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, kidnapped! And you&#39;re an accomplice! If I go to the authorities, I can have you charged with kidnapping, and holding me against my will, and assault, and sexual assault, and—and—&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad could barely think straight now, he was so angry, and he started to hyperventilate; but as for Vanessa, she was starting to comprehend the full horror of everything she&#39;d done to this man—this boy. And so, realization having dawned, she started wailing about how her fantasy was ruined, and blubbering about how she didn&#39;t know that Chad wasn&#39;t a real merman. (She&#39;d suspected, of course, but without proof it was easier to just play into her hopes.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; said Chad finally. &quot;Just . . . help me get this merman suit off and help me get my real skin back from Paul, and I won&#39;t tell anyone about you. Nobody has to know about any of this, but I want Paul and those assholes at the shop to pay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Vanessa. &quot;We have a deal.&quot; Then she looked very disappointed and said, &quot;I really thought that it was all real. That my girlhood dream was fulfilled, and mer-people really existed, and that I could love a merman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a powerful witch,&quot; said Chad. &quot;If witches are real and magic is real, maybe there still are real merfolk out there. Why don&#39;t you look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll do exactly that,&quot; said Vanessa. &quot;And for what it&#39;s worth . . . thank you for at least giving me some time to live my dream. Even if it wasn&#39;t real, and I didn&#39;t know that I was keeping a human boy prisoner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still thought you were keeping a merman prisoner,&quot; chided Chad. &quot;That&#39;s still pretty terrible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa said nothing; she knew Chad was right. She couldn&#39;t defend her actions, so she quickly changed the subject. &quot;I must not be *that* powerful of a witch, my charm can&#39;t even change you all the way out of that skin-suit,&quot; she said, looking up and down over Chad&#39;s half-merman form. &quot;I hate those nasty things. Ancient Lemurian magi-tech; *so* creepy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So . . . can you get me out of this thing?&quot; Chad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if I have another suit to work with,&quot; said Vanessa. &quot;Preferably your original skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is presently stuck to Paul. Or at least it was, when I last saw him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That works,&quot; said Vanessa. &quot;In fact, I have a little idea. Hold on a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
* * * * * * * * <br />
<br />
After running back to mansion to gather some necessary magical apparatus and material components, Vanessa returned to the poolside, glad to see Chad still waiting for her. &quot;Chad, was it? I&#39;m going to draw a summoning circle on the ground in Thulian chalk. Once I&#39;m done with that, I need you stand outside the circle, opposite me, while I cast the conjuration. Can you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so Vanessa went about preparing her witchcraft, burning incenses and herbs in a brazier on a tripod, chalking designs on the ground, and setting odd objects like straw-woven dolls and animistic fetishes around the circle. Then she stood on one side of it and put Chad on the other side and chanted some magic words in a deep and repetitive baritone—and POOF! Paul appeared atop the sigil, still looking like Chad, and looking very surprised. (He was wearing a three-piece suit and holding a laser pointer and a PowerPoint clicker—apparently, he had been giving some kind of presentation for some bigwigs.)<br />
<br />
Paul gaped. &quot;Vanessa Bishop? What the—?&quot; And then he turned around and saw Chad, standing on two scaly legs, his prick still hanging out for all the world to see. &quot;Oh SHIT!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa instantly picked up another magical component, a handful of silver dust, and she blew it across the circle at Paul and Chad. They both collapsed to the ground in a fit of coughing, and when the cloud at last wafted away, the Chad in the fancy suit was outside the circle, and the half-merman was inside. Vanessa then trotted lightly up to the indisposed Paul (now wearing the merman skin), retrieved her pearl necklace, and watched in smug satisfaction as his coughing became voiceless and silent, and his legs merged into a fishtail. For added measure, she also took the bracelet, and his dick and ass disappeared as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just be a lot more careful with both of these in the future, thank you very much,&quot; said Vanessa, pocketing both objects.<br />
<br />
Chad stood up, dusted off his fancy new duds, and echoed, &quot; &#39;In the future&#39;? Please tell me you&#39;re not planning on keeping him here, like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not forever,&quot; said Vanessa. &quot;But it would be more than he deserves. How long did Paul have you before me? Weeks? Months? Consider it serving a sentence. Paul can be my new fish-boy until I find a real, live merman. As a matter of justice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad thought about it for a moment and then decided, &quot;Yeah, all right.&quot; After all, this whole mess really was Paul&#39;s fault. &quot;But what about the skin-suit shop?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa grinned wickedly, while Paul, horrified at his new condition and his inability to speak, pulled his tail along the pavement until he was able to roll his body into the pool, and he swam down to hide in some dark corner under-water. &quot;Look in your pockets,&quot; she said to Chad.<br />
<br />
Chad searched, and he found lots of cool stuff, including a wallet with a fat roll of large bills, a black credit card, and some ID with his face but Paul&#39;s name. &quot;Looks like Paul&#39;s been busy linking my face to his life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Vanessa. &quot;Just . . . go back to the skin-suit shop and pretend to be Paul. And when you get there, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll come up with something. You&#39;re really a very clever young man, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know about that,&quot; said Chad, blushing a little bit. &quot;But, uh, before I go, I&#39;d like to ask a favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything you want,&quot; said Vanessa. &quot;Name it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh . . . the pool-girl, Amy. Can I have her phone number?&quot;</p>
