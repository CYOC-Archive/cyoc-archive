<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley groaned as the alarm clock beeped. He glancced and saw that it was 8:00 AM. It was Tuesday, the second day of his college classes. He glanced over and saw that Kyle was still sleeping, like yesterday. As Riley cleared the sleep fizz from his brain, he notied something out of the ordinary. His pajama pants were tented with his morning wood! It wasn&#39;t much, as Riley cock was far below average in size, but it still got Riley&#39;s attention. &quot;Whoa, morning wood? I never get that! Weird!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Riley glanced over to make sure his roommate was still asleep. KYle was snoring soundly. Riley got up and used his hands to cover his wood as best as he could. He hobbled to the bathroom and locked the door. He stepped in the shower and washed up. Eventually, his erection slowly subsided. &quot;Must have dreamt about some hot girls&quot;, he thought to himself. He noticed his armpits and groin wre still a bit itchy from yesterday, so he spent extra time washing them with his body wash. He got out of the shower and examined his reflection in the mirror. Riley didn&#39;t notice anything out of the ordinary, except he spied a couple dark hairs on his chin. He leaned in and saw that 4 or 5 dark hairs had grown out on his goatee area, but they were short and wispy. Riley shrugged. It was nothing worth shaving. He wrapped a towel around himself, noticing his bulge looked a bit bigger. &quot;Must just be because I had an erection earlier&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just then his armpits started to itch again. &quot;My armpits! Why do they itch?&quot;. He lifted up an arm and looked closely in the mirror. It didnt look red or irritated. He saw the small patch of light fuzz that grew out. Still only a small handful of hairs, but Riley thought it looked like a little more than yesterday. &quot;Hmm, must be my imagination&quot;. He left the bathroom, not bothering to put on deodorant; he never wore any anyway and he didn&#39;t want his pits to itch anymore. <br />
<br />
He threw on his tight whitey tighties, noticing they fet tighter than yesterday. They especially were tight around the groin, making his balls ahe slightly. Riley made a mental note to get some new ones; obviously the dryer at school was too hot and shrunk them. As he put on the rest of his clothes, the itching in his pits and groin subsided for the most part. He saw Kyle was gone; he had obviously jetted to class without taking a shower. He grabbed his backpack and headed out the door.<br />
<br />
Day two of his classes were mostly uneventful. He really enjoyed the material and paid close attention; he was hoping to get straight A&#39;s this semester. Half way through his chemistry lecture, the itching started up again. He groaned and scratched an armpit. He noticed that the itching had spread to around his belly button as well. He lifted up his shirt discretely in his seat, but didn&#39;t see anything out of the ordinary; it was the same old hairless pudgy stomach, no redness or rash or anything. &quot;Great, now that itches too&quot;, he muttered. A few moments after the itching started, he noticed his mind drifting from the lecture. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn&#39;t focus. He figured he was just tired or something. His mind kept wandering, and he began to look at his fellow classmates. He spied several girls in the front row. He saw they were wearing lowcut shirts. He looked them over, mentally undressing them. &quot;Damn, they are hot&quot;, he thought. &quot;Look at their chests! And those legs are great. Althought, they would look a little better with some hair on them&quot;. Just then, he felt a stirring in his groin. Uh Oh! Riley went red with embarassment as he noticed he was hard. &quot;Not again!&quot;, he groaned.<br />
<br />
It took several minutes to will it down, but it finally did. The bell rang and he rushed off. &quot;What is wrong with me? I&#39;ve never had an erection in class before! And why was I checking out those girls? That&#39;s so pervy! And why was I thinking about how hot they would be with hairy legs? That&#39;s just gross!&quot;. He hurried back to his dorm, unconsciously scratching his pits and stomach every once in a while. By the time he reached his dorm room, Riley was also scratching the center of his chest. Riley was too busy replaying what had happened in class to notice. <br />
<br />
He got to his dorm and took of his shoes. They felt too tight and were hurting his feet. He then grabbed a bite to eat, and sat down with his chemistry book. He couldn&#39;t concentrate very well and soon gave up to play video games. Kyle came back from his class a bit later. &quot;Hey Riley&quot;, he said. Riley looked up from his game and greeted his roommate. Riley was surprised to see Kyle wearing basketball shorts instead  of his usual jeans. Riley had never seen Kyle wear anything remotely athletic in his life. A thought raced through Riley&#39;s head; &quot;Why not? Athletic shorts are cool looking and comfortable. You should get a pair, too!&quot;. Riley found the idea strange, but he shook his head and quickly forgot about it. Kyle sat down and played video games with Riley.<br />
<br />
A little while later, Kyle grabbed a soda from the fridge. He chugged it quickly and burped very loudly. Riley was offended and shocked! His friend had never done something so crude. Another thought popped into Riley&#39;s head and he mentally argued with himself:<br />
<br />
&quot;Should you even be offended? Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because that is gross!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it&#39;s not. It&#39;s actually pretty funny! It&#39;s just the two of you, and your both guys. Who cares?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I guess that&#39;s true. Why was I offended in the first place. It was funny!&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley laughed at Kyle, saying &quot;Good one man!&quot;. Kyle flashed him a big grin. Riley got a soda from the fridge too and proceded to belch loudly as well. Even though he was having fun, a part of his mind was shocked at how he was behaving. Riley stopped belching and regained his composure. He went back to playing the video game. <br />
<br />
About an hour later, Riley looked over and saw Kyle taking off his T Shirt. Kyle saw Riley looking at him, so he added &quot;It&#39;s too hot in here!&quot;. Riley did think it was hot, but he would never take of his shirt like that in front of his friend. Another shot raced through his head; &quot;Why? Not like there is anything wrong with being shirtless&quot;. Riley quickly buried the thought. Why was he thinking this way? It was so unlike him.<br />
<br />
It was finally late and the boys decided to get to bed, for they had early classes the next day. Kyle got up and stretched, Riley stared at his friends shirtless torso. Did Kyle look a little bit bigger? He was usually rail thin, but he looked like he was putting on a little definition. As Kyle was stretching, he raised both his hands to the sky. Riley&#39;s eyes settled on his friend&#39;s pits. Riley thought that Kyle looked like he had a little bit more armpit hair, or it was darker or something. Like Riley, Kyle had only ever had little peach fuzz wisps of blonde hair, and even at that, no more than he could count on his two hands. There still were only very few hairs and they were still thin and wispy, but Riley could have sworn there was a bit more. <br />
<br />
He quickly realized he was eyeing his friend&#39;s body, and quickly averted his eyes. Kyle got into his bed and pulled the covers up. Riley remained on the couch a while longer after discovering, much to his embarassment, he had another erection. &quot;What the hell is going on with me?&quot;, he thought worriedly. As his erection subsided, Riley crawled into his dorm bed near Kyle&#39;s. He glanced across the room and saw that Kyle had thrown his T Shirt from earlier on the floor. &quot;Huh, Kyle always picks up after himself&quot;. As Riley drifted off to sleep, he contemplated all the weird things that had happened and the strange thoughts he had had all day. He hoped that tomorrow would be a better day.</p>
