<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Ignore this page! Other one is way better than mine!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Knob turning, door creaking, the three including Henry, Jess, and Melissa could only look at that side of the cabin. The door opened revealing James and Joan, wearing coats that protected themselves from the waist up.<br />
<br />
Melissa now realized many things. Henry had been telling her everything about the events that lead up to this moment. She thought it was all bullshit, but even worse was the fact that the goat freak was actually Joan all along. Melissa walked up to the door where the pair just entered the cabin.<br />
<br />
                &quot;Why did you do that out there you crazy bitch&quot;, Melissa always had a potty mouth and even though Henry explained the situation to her, she still didn&#39;t understand why Joan came at her like that.<br />
<br />
                  &quot;NO MELissaaaa.......&quot;, Jess was heartbroken that she just heard that, the one thing they forget to tell her was the first animal word you say in the cabin will turn you into that animal. Little did Jess know; Melissa already said bitch earlier and her fate was already sealed.  <br />
<br />
                   &quot;it&#39;s okay Jess just let it go&quot;, Realizing what just happened, Henry put his hand on Jess&#39;s shoulder, trying to comfort her. They both looked eachother in the eyes, lust was in the air. If no one was around Henry would take off her dress and fuck her again. Jess wanted it too, but talking amongst the others snapped them both out of it.<br />
<br />
                   Joan looked at James, he blushed and looked nervous. Of course she would never tell Melissa why she scared her away from the clearing. <br />
<br />
                   &quot;I just felt like it&quot;, said Joan in a submissive manner.  &quot;You were really cute when you were staring at my boobies Melissa&quot;, Joan was now toying with the brunette.<br />
<br />
                  Melissa was at a loss for words for what this goat freak just said. Even though she was blushing, she refused to believe that she stared at them. She would never find that stupid milf attractive. <br />
<br />
                &quot; If you would like to see them again I can show you right now...&#128149;&quot;, In saying this, Joan pulled her jacket apart and revealed everything. Her breasts, udders, and cock were on full display.      <br />
<br />
                  &quot;Ohh thats umm wow&quot;, Melissa was surprised at how sick and twisted these pervs were, how realistic those udders and penis looked. Why were they so devoted to this? This is beyond furry stuff, this was very hardcore, and why did this make her horny? Looking down Joan had what looked like goat feet, but what disturbed her most was James had similar hooves also, the coats couldn&#39;t hide everything and she quickly examined James&#39;s body. His skin looked different, almost soft like her own. His skin was a tint darker which resembled his natural hair color, his thighs seemed thicker, but finally his ass was pushing out of the coat &quot;His butt is slightly bigger than mine&quot;, Before Melissa could think any further, a mans voice shouted behind her.  <br />
<br />
<br />
                    &quot;Joan stop it now!&quot;, Henry finally put his foot down and had enough. &quot;How dare you even come back here after all you&#39;ve done&quot;, The room fell silent, almost waiting for Joans response.<br />
<br />
                    Joan promptly closed her coat, glared at Henry and thought out her next move. &quot;What have I done exactly? Im no saint, but I dont fuck my own daughter, and lie about it&quot;, Joan in a cold and killer mood continued her rant,  &quot;It&#39;s not Jess&#39;s fault, but yours; You crazy cow fucker. I can be the villain, but stop pretending your a nice above the law man; Your a freak like the rest of us&quot;, Joan needed to breath, but what she said was enough. <br />
<br />
                    Melissa caught in the crossfire wanted to leave to the one remaining room in the cabin immediately. Never liking when her parents would fight, this was no exception. As she was walking away, she looked at James and spoke to him.<br />
<br />
                   &quot;Babe we should talk sometime, and get out of here. When I get back my daddy will definitely fire Henry, but we won&#39;t let that break us up.. Will we?&quot;, Whispering with James, she almost made that sound like a threat. <br />
<br />
                    &quot;No of..of course not&quot;, James was stuttering and just wanted to go back to his room. Melissa than walked away, not believing anything she heard from Joan or Henry, as she was walking away ; Henry was bitter and humiliated, but couldn&#39;t help to glance at the girls tight ass as she walked away. This made him feel impure, and might have proven Joans point.<br />
<br />
                    &quot;There is a barn outside by the way&quot;, James had stayed silent up to this point. Joan secretly disliked that James brought it up, and hoped the two would find it themselves.<br />
  <br />
                     &quot;A barn?&quot;, Jess thought this was a joke.<br />
<br />
                     &quot;Wait until tomorrow Jess to look at it. I&#39;m assuming you won&#39;t like what you&#39;ll see in there&quot;. Joan warned Jess, and with all thats happened today; Who knows what would happen if she went in the barn tonight?<br />
<br />
                     The four went their separate ways after that last conversation. Joan would live permanently in the painting room, which is something she wanted. The future days would be tough for everyone, but who will persevere, and who will crumble in the Cabin in The woods!</p>
