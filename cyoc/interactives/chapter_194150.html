<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelly planned to drop Heather off at an orphanage. Heather would have to grow up all over again, but this time without her wealthy parents. There would be no more designer clothing for Heather, just old-dirty and ill fitting secondhand knock-off clothes. This time around Heather would grow up in poverty and by error and oversight she would go to an abusive home where she will be forced to slave away all day cooking, cleaning, and doing chores for her “parents” only to be berated and belittled for the simplest of mistakes.<br />
<br />
While her mind will remain intact, she will face ridicule and resentment from her peers. She will be known as the annoying know-it-all and as such will be an outcast amongst her peers. She will grow up bullied and without friends and her outlook will turn to the dark and depressing. <br />
<br />
In her teenage years she will be known as the weird goth chick with daddy issues. Due to the device Heather will enter puberty earlier and will grow larger than before, becoming quite the sexy buxom young woman. Being envious of her well endowment the popular kids will spread viscous rumors about her destroying any friendships she managed to make. Her desperate attempts to find acceptance will result in her having to compromise her beliefs and throwing away any shreds of respect she has by becoming the school slut.<br />
<br />
Now known as the easy goth slut, Heather will find her desire for companionship hollow as her true desire for friendship seemingly is out of reach. During this time Heather will experiment heavily with drugs and alcohol in a desperate endeavor to escape her shitty life. <br />
<br />
In her Jr year the climate at home will be too much for Heather to endure. She will wind up dropping out of high school and running away from home. The next few years will be extremely difficult for Heather that in order to prevent spending another night living on the streets in the dirty alleyways, she will swallow the last of her pride and become a stripper. While she won’t be living in a cardboard box anymore, her “new” apartment won’t be much of an improvement. Tiny, dirty, and located on the shady side of town Heather will spend many nights crying herself to sleep in her shitty apartment as she reflects on her poor life choices and her old life that she lost. <br />
<br />
With no high school degree Heather will not be able to find a decent job. And due to her ever growing addiction to cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol Heather will be forced into prostitution to pay off her debts. After a few years Heather will have racked up a rather long list of  criminal charges from soliciting prostitution to possession of narcotics that she spends just as many nights in jail as she does in bed with clients.<br />
<br />
One night while meeting a new client, Heather will meet a charismatic and kind man. This man will offer Heather an opportunity for a fresh start. Seeing her only opportunity Heather will run off the the handsome stranger and will even marry him the next day. <br />
<br />
Finally, Heather would get the life she so desperately wanted. Unfortunately for her, fate would twist her dream. The man she had married would become a leader in a nudist doomsday cult. For as long as they remained nude they would be sparred the coming destruction. This cult would seek to rebuild society after the “Great Old Ones” had “destroyed” the world. Heather would eventually find herself pregnant with eight children before her first anniversary. As soon as she birthed her children she would be impregnated again, and thanks to the cult’s “kook-aid”  fertility rates were extremely high and cases of twins, triplets, quadruplets, and octuplets were a common occurrence. As a result of being perpetually pregnant Heather would find her breasts growing three cup sizes and were always heavy and full of milk. Her nipples would eventually grow long and fat constantly lactating and aroused with the slightest breeze.  <br />
<br />
Within a few years the cult doctrine had changed from having women treated as near demigods and restorers of humanity to second class citizens then eventually slaves and cattle. Heather had come 360. Back to a life of abuse and being treated as a slave. She was forever the dutifully wife cooking her husband meals, cleaning the house, raising the children, birthing more children, tending to the livestock, and pleasuring her man.<br />
<br />
Her life could have been worse, she could of ended up like some of the women to be caged in a stabled, hooked up to milking machines constantly producing milk for the cult. Or like some women forced to walk around on all fours, forced to be beasts of burden, to ploy the fields or pull the carriages.<br />
<br />
Heather still cried herself to sleep but now only half the time with regret and sorrow. For the other half she was happy to have finally have companionship, her own family. In her own twisted way her dream had come true, her spirit broken long ago but thanks to some mind altering “therapy” she was happy.<br />
<br />
As Kelly pulled up to the orphanage Heather began to cry. Heather’s cries grew louder and louder as Kelly unfastened her from the car seat. The premonition of her future fate was all Heather could think of, and she struggled with all her might to escape this horrific fate but it was all to no avail. Kelly was on the doorsteps when Heather pooped her diaper. Kelly smiled at Heather making sure to enjoy the moment. <br />
<br />
“Enjoy your new life Heather. Hope you learn to not be a spoiled bitch.”<br />
<br />
Kelly rang the doorbell and ran off. She planned to keep a close eye on Heather’s development and enjoy a long punishment.<br />
<br />
Heather’s premonition came true. Kelly enjoyed watching the young Heather grow up miserable and alone. Heather’s disappearance would shake the town, her real parents would spend their fortune trying to find their girl and Heather’s case would go down as one of the top unexplained disappearances of the decade.</p>
