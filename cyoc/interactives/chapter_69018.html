<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To the untrained eye, nothing seemed to happen at first, but for the two watching women searching for any hint of the changes they hoped for, it was already underway.<br />
<br />
Cat tried her best not to gasp as Jess watched the movie. She quickly shot her face to Mary's and silently pointed to the top of her head. Mary looked back to Jess and her eyes widened in stunned silence.<br />
<br />
Jess was losing her hair. Little by little, it looked like her hair was receeding into her scalp. Her shoulder length brunette strands had become as low as her ears in just seconds. And it was still progressing.<br />
<br />
At the same time, Jess scratched her side gently as her skin began to itch. The sensation was spreading. In confusion, she looked down and noticed that her hands seemed rougher. On her face, however, it looked like her skin was growing coarse and drying out, some of it even starting to flake off. That was while her nose began to shrink into her face and flatten.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God.&quot; Cat finally laughed. &quot;It's working!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What?&quot; Jess turned to face the woman, her eyebrows vanishing and her hair down to few wisps on her scalp, as her pupils suddenly dialated and began to change into a reptile's.<br />
<br />
Mary sat with her hands to her mouth in pure childish delight. The two women simply watched, awed, as Jess looked over her situation with growing alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What the fuck?&quot; Jess cursed, scratching her body. All over she was itching, aching. &quot;W-What is this?&quot; At the same time, her nails began to grow longer. The last of her hair faded away, the very roots and finally follicle vanishing until she was totally bald.<br />
<br />
The cold draft on Jess's head startled her and she drew her increasingly lizard like hands to the top of her bald rough skinned head. At the shock of feeling her baldness she stood up quickly and backed away from the couch. Her skin was starting to grow perfectly scaly and thick. Her eyes were bright yellow with dark slitted reptilian pupils. She looked down at herself again and the yellow eyes widened in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What is this?&quot; Jess cried. &quot;Oh my God! What is this?!&quot; As she continued backing up her feet pulled and she stumbled, falling back onto her rear. She looked down at her feet and her face registered the same gaping shock as Mary and Cat. Her toes were merging. Totally scaly and green, her two small toes on each foot were joining together into one whole while her big toe was growing large and pointy.<br />
<br />
Cat could resist it no longer. She slipped her hand down her pants, the heat from her arousal unbearable. Mary saw this and grinned with a smirk, watching their lizard woman continue to change.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Oh God! S-Stop!&quot; The reptile Jess reeled in homophobic terror. &quot;No! Please!&quot; Though her face was a rough approximation of what it had been her nose was shrunken down to two slits with a small bridge. Her lips had faded to scaly patterning, while her totally hairless body continued to harden into leathery scales much like an iguana's.<br />
<br />
Jess's pitiful expression turned to abject horror as she realized what was happening. They were doing this to her somehow. &quot;M-Mary!&quot; Jess turned to her friend, her eyes pleading. &quot;N-No! Please! Make this stop! Please! I'm a freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cat continued to watch, now moaning, as Jess's face began to press forward. Inching it's way into a muzzle with each passing second. Her ears were shrinking down now, and the beggining of a tail was visible at the back of her pants. Her feet and hands, meanwhile, were totally reptilian and large. Her three toed feet large, hard, and scaly, with thick scaly pads of lighter green underneath. Her body was now totally encased in shimmering glassy lizardflesh, the intricate squares of green only becoming more defined.<br />
<br />
Jess looked to Mary again. She saw her hands and her eyes teared up. She reached up and touched her face, feeling her growing longer in her palms. &quot;Mary!&quot; She rasped, her voice a little rougher. &quot;Help me! I'm your friend! Help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary rose from the couch dramatically, patting Cat on the shoulder and allowing her to continue. Jess watched, cringed as her face tugged out, and vaguely felt her tail growing longer and thicker behind her, now slipping down her pant leg.<br />
<br />
Mary kneeled beside Jess, marvelling at the alien beauty of the lizard woman hybrid. She gently brushed her hand across the cool flesh of Jess's face, tracing the contour of her growing snout. Jess didn't even try to fight, so horrified that she could barely think.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not my friend.&quot; Mary said coldly, then grinned as she stepped back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooooooo!&quot; Jess squeeled, desperately kicking to her feet and standing up. Her heart pounded in her chest and she trembled, holding her sides in clawed hands. She was somewhere between lizard and human now, a blend of both, and as her tail reached her raising heels she stopped, looked down, and let out a gasp.<br />
<br />
Cat gasped sharply, thrilled at the sight, and felt her climax coming on.<br />
<br />
Mary turned, just as thrilled with the results, and began to approach Jess slowly. The lizard backed away, scared, and ran herself right into the corner of the room. She stared, her new jaws hung open in horror, as Mary came face to snout with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary...&quot; Jess whispered. &quot;Please. Don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't what?&quot; Mary grinned sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;P-Please.&quot; Jess repeated, clutching herself and trembling, trying to ignore the new sensations of her cold blooded body. Her glossy scales. Her long sinewy tail. Her clothing started to feel tight and restrictive. She was growing now.</p>
