<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David could feel the powers swirling around him. Even the loose papers on his desk lifted up by the breeze which whirled inside the enclosed room.<br />
<br />
A sudden pressure in his chest as ribs began to expand, made David cry out &quot;Hoorah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Even before he thought of removing his clothing the buttons popped from his shirt. The buckle on his pants flew across the room as hips too began their expansion.<br />
<br />
Turning in circles David was feeling the wild desire of the beast he had for ever and ever longed to become. As he turned the room began to spin, air rushing like a tornado caught inside his study. Chairs began to flip over as other furniture was pushed about the room.<br />
<br />
David, wide eyed and loving every minute was also watching himself turn too. Turn yes but not due to the force of that wierd wind. Skin darkened, turning blacker and thickening to the tough hide grated to all ponies.<br />
<br />
As fingers knarled down into a fist, wrists shifted, bones clicked into different but for some totally new positions.<br />
<br />
Holding his head high the man David let fly a true full sounded whinnie of a pony soon to join the ranks of an animal world. Breathing in deep heavy draughts of air David's lungs began to change.<br />
<br />
The thumping of his expanding heart, the strong chest muscles made now to pull and run, all this was making a wonderful feeling of strength and power.<br />
<br />
Time passed but David was no giving it one single care, he was involved in a wonderous adventure. Clothing few off his rapidly changing body. Kicking off shoes his socks ripped wide open as toes fused into a hoof, and feet grew in length.<br />
<br />
Naked he was and yet not naked at all! His own human skin now changed, the jet black hair of a Welsh Mountain Pony making for David his coat against all weathers. Even as his joy grew so also was him manhood changing to what one might expect a Welsh stallion should own.<br />
<br />
A his pelvis rocked a little the penis sported a heavy folding of skin known the world over as a sheath. Burrowed deep was the massive black penis of a truly wonderous pony stallion. This being born to him by the powers of the book as they knew not how to do things only halfway.<br />
<br />
Stomping his hind legs their strength and shape firming up to make for this new stallion legs granting great speed. As David stomped the jiggle of new and larger testicles shook and gave him another sensual touch to a form made for the more sensual of life.<br />
<br />
Slapping thickened lips, straining his set focused eyes David peered right and left feeling and wanting to see the changes as they occured. Ears twitched, he shook his long black mane, a flicking of a tail and for all possible purpose David was now a Welsh Pony Stallion!<br />
<br />
As he leaned with forehoofs onto his Cherrywood desk the stallion looked down. The wind was slowing as the print on those parchment pages nolonger glowed. Even as he watched the pages fluttered over till with one last gust of wind the book's cover flopped shut.<br />
<br />
Snorting and enjoying the sensual feel David thought a bit before stepping down to all fours. <br />
<br />
Thump, went his hoofs of the carpeted floor. A step, then another and soon a joy filled pony trotted about the large room. As from the wild wind his furniture lay here and there. A pony thrilled trotted the room jumping short jumps over this chair and that table.<br />
<br />
Out of breath he stopped, &quot;This was so wonderful a feeling and way of life he was sorry it would only last a day!&quot;<br />
<br />
After just an hour and two hearty rounds of pony masturbation the delight took a dulled tone. David's many plants and flower were soon ingested down to the dirt in the pots. Then laying down it was a sleepy pony who sacked out on the floor.<br />
<br />
A noise, David awoke with a start, it was light out and the sound of Minne from Molly Maid reminded the human thinking pony of what day this was now.<br />
<br />
Being Friday Minnie was there to clean up but for David the Welsh Pony Stallion he was not what she might expect to find.<br />
<br />
Standing, tail flicking in a frantic mode David watched the french doors open slowly as Minne walked into the study.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God what a messssssssssssss!&quot; then screamed Minnie as she saw the large black pony standing there before her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get!&quot; she yelled swatting at David's face.<br />
<br />
Get he did embarressed by her seeing him even if she had no rhyme or reason to know it was David. Instincts, and the will to survive drove the stallion down the main hallway, through the Kitchen, and with a bounding jump was launched into and through a side window.<br />
<br />
David might not have even remembered the crash landing he made out into the backyard, but the pony bolted left running out and down the rear alley and freedom.<br />
<br />
Wild and not really thinking in any rational manner David just charged out into Simpson Street almost getting nailed by a passing car.<br />
<br />
Scared, embarressed, and frightened again by a close call with death David headed for the safety of the City Park.<br />
<br />
Snorting, trying in the worst way to catch his breath David stood there looking about the grassy park. A sniff, another, and the driving Pony instincts took fast hold over any objection David's mind could make.<br />
<br />
Lips slapping, moaning to himself how good the grass tasted, how sweet it was he graze oblivious to the world around him.<br />
<br />
It was a soft spoken voice that brought him hald back to reality. A halter slid over his still munching muzzel and was snugged down behind his ears. The clipping sound of a mountaineer's clip and one rein made him wonder, but with a tug he walked peaceably at their side.<br />
<br />
The sounds of children soon met his new ears. The person walking him along called to another and not long before he joined the others. Round and around he walked in a slow dizzy circle. David's nose almost forced into the butt of some animal like himself.<br />
<br />
All was at peace, David's thoughts burried down deep into the pony he was knew this would only last for a day. He remembered that quite well, it was the driving thought which told him to stay calm and be a good pony.<br />
<br />
It was late and David expected to be soon standing there in harness a naked foolish feeling man. Odd he thought as the darkness came but without any change of form. He was fed like the others and bedded down in a large horse trailer. The stench of urine and manure caught his nostrils well but he ignored it as by morning this would become another fond memory.<br />
<br />
The banging of a wooden spoon on the underside of a metal dishpan was the alarm clock for those ponies to rise and meet the day. <br />
<br />
David rose up stretched and licking thick lips and blocklike slab teeth found himself still that jet black pony stallion. A flick of the tail carressed his wide open anus making it tickle and giving him an anxious need to crap.<br />
<br />
The bladder won first prize as with a half step forward his body lengthened the penis fell out huge and heavy. A flooding wash of bright yellow urine splattered the straw covered floor. The smell was to him more a favorable scent, his scent and it felt even more his home.<br />
<br />
Oh but those coarse hairs of his heavy and thick tail were not to be outdone. A wisking over his soft bulbous anus has the tail jumping out of the way as jolt after flop ozzed out into the light of day.<br />
<br />
Duties done the people came in shoveling his leavings and spreading new straw. A bucket made of wood was placed before him, it was filled with grain. Corn mostly, and then oats, and rye mixed with a sweet tang of molasses. A quarter bale of hay and by eleven O-clock he and the others began their ritual of round and around.<br />
<br />
So it went one day to the next and so no as time marched its course. David remembered his saying on day, but one had passed as did several more but he remained still a pony.<br />
<br />
A stormy rainy day met David on his anniversary of one full week as a Welsh Pony.  The people kept the ponies inside the contained trailer, David was bored by this and standing about he listened to his guts grumble.<br />
<br />
The evening brought a stop to the rain and the people took David out his stall. As he stood there looking about feeling glad to be out of the trailer, they led out a brown dappled sandy mane and tailed mare.<br />
<br />
David watched with wondering eyes as the people placed leather straps to the hind legs of the one pony. As she stood there the person did smear her pink winking vulva with some oily smelling salve.<br />
<br />
A long rein tethered to David's halter and the two people stood back and away. The smell of the oily salve mixed with the surging juices foaming out from the rear lips of this most calm mare.<br />
<br />
It was fast getting to David's now twisted human and equine senses. A sniff, then a deep drafting sniff had his body surging in wild sudden passion. Snorting, shaking his big head David approached the mare. <br />
<br />
The pretty mare turned her head and with a sofy nieghing sound did lower her head almost touch those thick lips to the ground. Her tail rose up and set to one side as David's mind began to race.<br />
<br />
David was not in control but niether did he care to be as the lust of being a pony and stallion seemed very enjoyable at the moment. Painfully erect his penis was stiff as a 2x4. Every step made the shaft sway and with this the feeling built his lust for male pony desire.<br />
<br />
Screaming a loud whinnie David bounced aboard the young mare. Inching alone till his penis was behind and when out straight stood just above the pretty swaying tail.<br />
<br />
A warm friendly hand did guide the shaft as with the flared end touched those wanring lips of equine sex all the world around mattered not at all.<br />
<br />
In went the shaft, down inch by evry glorious inch till David's leathery folds of that shaeth met those hot lips of pony mare sex.<br />
<br />
Almost jumping off the ground David began to thrust in and pull out the tight juicy mare below him. The book must have know something, had the experience, or was this just plain dumb luck? David's taller stance was for him as a stallion one fine stroke of enjoyment. Being he stood taller his penis dwelled deeper and was empaled into the mare for the fullest of male-female satisfactions<br />
<br />
Mating went on for just a few short minutes till with a grunting moan David's large healthy testicles forced out a major load. <br />
<br />
As David stepped down he was congratulated by the owners and allowed that night to graze the ball diamond alone.<br />
<br />
The next day and the next after that were for David a real joy. His memory of the mare and having had sex with a real mare in stallion form was worth everything he owned. It was with the second anniversary of his transformation he began to worry.<br />
<br />
One night as the breeze kept the heat of the trailer cool David lay all crumpled down and ready to sleep. over and over he pawed the spell in mind. He remembered it well and might even be able to repeat it now if not for the very real fact of his strange mouth and inhuman lips. Pondering it he nervously thought over each line till something hit a bell.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Book!&quot; It was written hundreds of years ago and maybe in the times of Galileo. Maybe it was not infalible? Maybe when David said one day he said one Solar day? A solar day, a day in the life of the Sun!<br />
<br />
David thought long and hard about this till he remembered his seventh grade science teacher, good ole' Mister Atkinson! <br />
<br />
In a sudden scramble David stood up. He made such a ruckus that the other ponies also stood up and began to whinnie.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's it!' thought David, &quot;One solar day is equal to 26 days on earth time.<br />
<br />
Now he had a reason for his contiued time in stallion pony form. It made sense, he was happy the problem was solved! Crumpling down he readied for sleep and soon let the tired feeling of pony life and form drift him into slumberland.<br />
<br />
Again went the days till after another rainy day he was taken from the trailer to watch his sweet lover from before readied to recieve yet another sample of David's pony sperm.<br />
<br />
This time the feeling was wilder than the first. The new stallion had leanred to appreciate the depth and thus kept his saft burried a lot longer. As the rein pulled him off his love David let loose a scream whinne. The loudness was enough to make the handler drop the reins and David then to plunge once more into his loving mare.<br />
<br />
Anger and lust made for his screaming cry, David was happy at being a stallion in stud. He was wishing this would never end and that the book would maybe just burn up in a fire.<br />
<br />
Ah but no such luck as one morning David awoke early. He sat up and was himself a man and naked to the world.<br />
<br />
Stealing a pair of coveralls and bare foot he headed out for home. The morning dampness touched his human feet making him wish all the more he still had hoofs.<br />
<br />
Not far, the alley loomed large and a short run till David entered the house his Father built many years ago. A dash to the study, not even closing the back door.<br />
<br />
The room was straightened, furniture up straight and all in place. A quick look to the desk and his wonderous book was gone. David plopped into a chair as tears loomed and sobs made more tears.<br />
<br />
Then the phone rang, it rang, and rang till he slowly picked it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you David!&quot; came the words from a soft voice the other end on that line.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh!&quot; replied David.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its me Minnie, and I do love you David!&quot; said the Maid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, you what?&quot; asked David his thoughts still a fuzzy blurr.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you as you loved me, you didn't know that was me but I knew it was you, it had to to be true!&quot; said Minnie.<br />
<br />
David's mind was still mixed into a dense fog.<br />
<br />
&quot;David, I read your book, the place you marked it made sense to me after I chased you out of the house. I sat down and read it aloud, it worked on me and as I asked for to be your friend it made me your lover too! You liked my sandy hair of mane and tail, didn't you David?&quot; asked Minnie.<br />
<br />
David stood with phone in hand and had to think about this!</p>
