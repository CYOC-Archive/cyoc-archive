<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Freaked out, I keep looking between my tented jeans and Wendy, more specifically, at her stomach. It was so real that just a minute ago it was swollen and round with babies. My offspring. And as freaky as that was, I can hear my inner wolf getting excited. &#39;Good. Strong mate. Strong pups. Strong pack. Alpha need strong pack. Good.&#39; He might be happy with this scenario, but for Joe the human, its too much. I spring from my seat on the couch and readjust my dick back into a less compromising position. &quot;Sorry Wendy. I can&#39;t do this. I want to fuck, not have kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be silly. We can&#39;t fight this vision. Maybe we can delay it. But you will have sex with me and we will get pregnant. Why is that so hard to understand?&quot; She starts playing with my zipper like she&#39;s dick starved all of a sudden. But I step away from her touch. &quot;Because you have gotten all summer to learn to deal with this stuff. I stopped being 100 percent human yesterday and that other half of me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you other half?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He kind of wants me to.&quot; Understatement. &quot;Look just leave me alone, okay Wendy?. I&#39;m not ready for this.&quot; I leave her alone in the living room to walk into the kitchen. Maybe I can keep my mind off of things by helping Arlene in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
I walk in as she finishing up seering the last of two steaks on the stove. The smell hits me like a wall. It&#39;s a wonder I didn&#39;t smell them before but I was thoroughly distracted. &quot;Hi Joe. Did someone come down yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just this Oracle. Wendy.&quot; The wolf inside barks her name till it echoes in my head. Shut up, Fido.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I love Wendy. Sweet girl. Most oracles are standoffish and don&#39;t mingle well with others. Seeing too many futures on contact can be overwhelming when meeting new people. But she always keeps friendly. Did she see anything with from you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah. Too much. But the wolf disagrees. &#39;Confirmed strong mate bring strong pups. Big healthy pups. Willing to hold again. Good mate.&#39; I shake it off. &quot;I mean yeah. She just saw my birthday and what my initials were. Nothing big.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arlene puts down the steak onto a plate once its medium rare and places her hands on her hips. &quot;Joe she doesn&#39;t repeat visions. She has perfect recall. She got that one last week. What did you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot; &#39;Everything.&#39;<br />
<br />
Arlene dashes up to me and flashes her red vampire eyes. &quot;Joseph. This is your first time seeing the future. This could be very important. Don&#39;t lie to me. What did you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We had pups!&quot;<br />
<br />
Arlene takes a step back, clearly not expecting that one. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wendy and I got a little...comfortable on the couch and she had a vision. I saw us having sex and then her being pregnant. Very pregnant. Huge! With my kids.&quot; I slide down on the floor and put my head in my hands. Arlene follows me down and rubs my shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Six. Six werewolf babies were inside of her. And I put them there. But I just became a werewolf yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually you were sleeping for three weeks. You became a werewolf three weeks ago. I told you you slept more than most.&quot; I look at her shocked but it passes. Not the wierdest thing today.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get that it&#39;s alot but you can&#39;t fight this. All you&#39;ll be doing is causing yourself strain trying to delay it. I&#39;m guessing your wolf is trying to tell you to go to her?&quot; I nod my head. &quot;Well there&#39;s a reason for that. A werewolf, while staying here, doesn&#39;t normally meet one of its own. They have to go out into the world for that. And then they find another like them, another werewolf, that leads them to find a partner. Someone strong and fertile to have pups with, to build a pack. That&#39;s why George left. That&#39;s why they all leave. Normally, they pick one of their own kind but as long as pups are in the future, they don&#39;t mind. You just saw that you can have a future with Wendy. A sure future. Of course your wolf wants to go for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But six puppies? Six children?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did she look healthy? Happy?&quot; I nod. &quot;Well then she&#39;s fine with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know Arlene. I can&#39;t let my other side win. I have to say no to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. But you&#39;ll only be hurting yourself. Help me carry some of these plates into the dining room. The others should be down by now.&quot; She helps me up and takes the steaks while handing me the giant bowl of fruit salad. We walk out into a chatty room filled with six people already mingling. Six creatures. One including Wendy sitting by herself with an empty seat on her left. Shit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning everyone. Where&#39;s Nikolas?&quot; Arlene asks as if nothing happened. A thin guy in a Metallica t shirt with a lazy scruff on his face yawns and answers, grabbing a roll from the table. &quot;Bumped into him in the hallway heading back into his room. Said something about &#39;losing another one&#39;. Who knows with him.&quot; He&#39;s eyeing my chest and then I realise I left it in the living room when Wendy and I... fuck. I would be embarrassed but no one at the table seems to mind. Hell, they all seem to be enjoying it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well everyone. I&#39;d like you to meet our newest houseguest. Joseph DiAntonio. He&#39;s a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy from before jokes &quot;More like sleepywolf. But Jesus dude, could you be anymore ripped? Someone took their time to marinate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be nice Sam. He&#39;s new.&quot; Arlene turns to me. &quot;That&#39;s Samuel. Our resident wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s me. Just let me get a few samples from you later for my spells and we&#39;ll be friends. Or more if you&#39;re down.&quot; I flinch and he laughs. &quot;Or not. That&#39;s cool too. Nikolas will be bitter though. He likes werewolves. Fair warning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright thank you Sam for that warm welcome. Now Joe why don&#39;t you take a seat and get to know everyone?&quot; I make a move for the empty chair next to a purple braided girl in a wheelchair sipping on some juice. But Arlene grabs me by my collar with a smile. &quot;Why not next to our oracle Wendy? She&#39;d be perfect to introduce you around.&quot; Her smile says &#39;please&#39; while her red eyes say &#39;or else&#39;.<br />
<br />
I huff and grab the seat next to Wendy. I can feel my stomach do flip flops as I get closer. &#39;Good. Mate is here. My Wendy.&#39; But I try to shake it off. Good thing Arlene takes those two juicy steaks from earlier and plops them both down on my plate. &quot;A growing wolf needs his energy.&quot; The smell of the dripping slabs of meat distracts me from my problems enough to hypnotize me. I take a giant whiff and stab the top one with my fork and take a giant chomp out of it...Oh my god.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe. Are you okay?&quot; Wendy asks next to putting her hand on my thigh. &#39;Yes. Mate is good. Meat is good. We are happy.&#39; And I am. So happy I don&#39;t even notice the growing sensation from earlier. My muscles all flex and pump out with each breath as my wolf slowly takes over my body. My fangs grow, sinking deeper into the absolutely amazing steak. My ears tickle but I can&#39;t tell that they&#39;ve grown out. Nor do I notice the ridge forming on my brow, making me look more wolf like. The only time I notice something is off is when my growing claws force me to drop the fork and I&#39;m holding the steak by my teeth. I look around everyone has their eyes on me. Wendy squeezes my thigh. &quot;Joe? Are you okay?&quot; I look down at her and she flinches. &quot;Your eyes are glowing.&quot; I would answer but I&#39;m not here right now. Only the wolf. And the wolf has meat on his tongue and his mate in his sights. Wolf is fine.<br />
<br />
Wolf grabs the steak in our hands and devours the whole thing in three bites. He only licks our chops for a second before grabbing the second one and downing it just as quickly. But Wolf is still hungry. He eyes the rest of the table and finds a plate of bacon. He scoops up the entire plate and dumps it onto ours and sticks our entire face in, stuffing as much as he can into our mouth. He&#39;s almost full, but still very hungry. He eyes the table looking for more to eat until Arlene dumps a plate of eggs in front of us. &quot;A full wolf is a happy wolf.&quot; If I could notice her by her face and not just by the scent of a friendly vampire, I would see her smiling, like she has done this before many times. But I would also notice everyone else in the room being frozen with fear, curiousity, or amazement. But Wolf just scarfs down the eggs and finally takes a breath. He pats our slightly distended but still very muscular stomach and hazily looks for. &quot;Wendy.&quot; Her hand never left our thigh but the others (except for Arlene of course) are shocked to hear me call out her name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Wolf leans over to her seat and sniffs her hair. Mmm, my Wendy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe doesn&#39;t know what he wants. But we know what is best.&quot; The others in the room look at Wendy shocked, but keep watching us like prime time entertainment. Wendy tries to keep our earlier situation a secret. &quot;Oh you&#39;re just tired after such a big breakfast. Maybe you should go lie down in your room?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wolf sticks his nose in her neck and licks her cheek. Sam almost chokes on his bread. &quot;Maybe you should come lie down with Joe? He wants to but he needs me to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe, maybe we should do this some other time. Its breakfast.&quot; Wolf can smell her embarrassment but she is also a little aroused. So Wolf doesn&#39;t stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, My Wendy. Didn&#39;t you say that you want my Wolf? Well I&#39;m here. I can give it to you. Wolf has plenty to give our Mate. Strong mate. Take me and my seed. Pack bond strong.&quot; I lick her face again and I can feel through Wolf myself getting aroused and losing a grip on my surroundings. Only Wendy remains focused. &quot;Mate.&quot; I moan into her ear again as a pull her chair closer to my own to hold her.<br />
<br />
Arlene stands up snapping the others out of watching my display. &quot;Wendy maybe you should go with Wolf upstairs now. I will take care of things down here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wolf? This is Joe, you know him Arlene. Even if he is acting a bit forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Wendy. This isn&#39;t Joe, this is Wolf, his heightened Wolf self. He has given into his more primal instincts now. You need to go calm him down now. Bring back Joe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Wendy. Mate. Bring back Joe. Mate.&quot; Wolf starts thrusting our hips in the chair, eager to touch Wendy. &quot;Puppies. Strong pack. Please. Mate.&quot; I nibble on Wendy&#39;s earlobe and she quickly stands up. &quot;Excuse me everyone. But Wolf needs me to help him with something. Come one Wolf.&quot; She gets out of her chair and starts to walk away before Wolf scoops her up in our arms. Bridal style.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wendy safe. Alpha strong&quot; Wolf cooes into her ear as he carries her out of the kitchen and into the living room where he leaps up the stairs in a single bound. I can hear Sam shout &quot;What the Hell was that?&quot; behind us but Wolf doesn&#39;t care. Wolf opens the door to my room and kicks it closed behind us. He dashes forward to place Wendy gently on our bed and takes off our pants. &quot;Wolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mate?&quot; He jumps onto the bed and climbs onto top of Wendy kissing her body and biting the collar of her t-shirt with our fangs. She really likes that. &quot;Are you sure you want to do this now? We could wait so I can pick up some condoms or birth control...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Joe is stupid. We need pack. Pack needs to be strong and big. Like you.&quot; Wolf reaches down to her legs and in one swipe with our claws, slices the pajama pants and underwear off of her body without even grazing her skin. He grabs onto her hips and devours her mouth forcing her to moan in complete surrender. Wolf rips her shirt and bra off too, leaving her just as naked as we are. Her skin is flushed with anticipation and her little pink nipples have grown hard. Wolf takes one in his mouth as he settles our heavy meat in between her legs. Wendy cries out completely overtaken by the sensation  and starts bucking her hips wildly. &quot;Do it! Mate me! Make the vision come true!&quot;<br />
<br />
I oblige my Wendy and begin to enter her. My pretty virgin is no more. Now only my Mate. Must give her my pack. She cries out as I fill her up deeper and deeper, wrapping her arms around my neck tightly as I place comforting kisses over her ample breasts. &quot;Wendy. My Wendy. Need to see you full of my pups. These will grow so big. Fuck!&quot; I start to pump in and out of her building up to a steady rhythm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe is that you?&quot; The Wolf shakes his head but I respond. &quot;God Wendy I&#39;m sorry. But I can&#39;t stop myself. I need you!&quot; Her breasts jump up and down as I pound into her, just like in the vision. They look even better from this angle. But I only get a few more pumps in until I feel my balls start to tighten up. &quot;Here it comes, Wendy. I cn&#39;t hold back much longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nods, unable to say a thing, right as I am forced to blow my seed into my willing partner with a loud wolf howl. I can see her clench up below me as she probably reached her climax too but I&#39;m completely overcome with pleasure to try to continue.  Finally sated, I can feel Wolf slowly retreat back inside me as I shift into my human form again. It takes all of my energy to lay next to her and hold her as the rest of my seed spills into her. I kiss her forehead to comfort my mate. &quot;You did so well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? You did all the work. That was amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you have the most important job of all. Why shouldn&#39;t I pamper my mate?&quot; She hums happily as I continue to shower her with praise in between kisses. &quot;You&#39;re going to be so beautiful swollen with my pups.&quot; I finally stop pouring into her and we just lay together still connected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that Wolf talking or Joe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both. God you&#39;ll look so sexy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With morning sickness?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With a giant belly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Based on that vision, I&#39;ll be giant.&quot;<br />
<br />
I take one of her nipples in between my fingers and play with it. She smiles satisfied. &quot;And so will these. I love them huge.&quot; She scoffs and tries to turn around but I hold her close to me with a kiss on her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember in that vision how happy I looked to see you?&quot; Wendy nods. &quot;Well aside from being surprised by our little development, a part of me watching was happy too. I was just shocked is all. I am happy.&quot; She giggles and kisses me back. &quot;Good. Now one part of the vision has come to pass. Now we wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eagerly.&quot; We lay together in silent bliss for a minute before Wendy mentions, &quot;You know I kind of liked the howl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did huh? It felt like the right thing to do.&quot;</p>
