<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Spud, I think I'd like to...ask a few questions. I mean man, you just drop that one on me and shit- I mean dammit, how? Why? Fuck when?” Adams eyes where wide and round and he couldn’t move his eyes from spuds huge dripping cock. <br />
Spud chuckled and zipped himself up, his cock making a tremendous bulge in his pants, but it broke Adam’s stare and made him refocus on Spuds face. <br />
“It’s a long tale, but the simple version is I got a bunch of jobs after High School. One involved a trip to Europe as a ‘helper’ to a stock broker type. Good fuck too. We went to Russia, Moscow first, and then the far side to Vladivostok. Over there I met some people who might have been part of my family line many years back. They took me to their village and introduced me to various ‘relatives’ – I suspected a scam and kept being nice to them, buying them stuff things like that. Then I met Mikal. Massive man, simply huge. Bigger than you where in college, bigger even than Barry- you remember Barry?” Adam nodded his head, who could forget the 7’ man-mountain Barry Barker had been. Spud took a swig from his beer, emptying it. <br />
“Well Mikal blew me away, you know what I was like for big men? Well Mikal took me off to the forests and did me. He was rough, and dangerous, he took me bareback and repeatedly. At the time I couldn’t have stopped him even if I had wanted to. He kept me tied up and used me like a fuck toy for a week. I was ripped up and bruised all over. Several times he bit me- I was a mess. Then at the end of the week he took me back to town, dumped me at the back of the hotel and told me I was genna be a Bear like him. Then he fucked off back into the swirling snow storm. Lucky for me the porter found me and got in from the cold. Him and my American partner got the police and health people involved but in the end they did nothing but patch me up.” Spud stopped his tale and walked out to the kitchen; he came back with an arm full of beers and dropped them onto the coffee table. <br />
“Help yourself” he rumbled before taking a swig of one himself. Adam grabbed a fresh one.<br />
“So you didn’t know what he’d done to you?”<br />
“All I knew buddy was I healed damm fast. We where on the way back to Moscow within a couple of weeks I was eating everything in sight at the time. Like a Bear stocks up on fats for the long winter? That was me. Man that was a weird period. My partner was jumped in a side street and I nearly went berserk pulling the guy off him. Hell he made me a full trading partner after that started me off with my first portfolio. Second month we was in Paris and I was fucked up the whole time- I was eating for four, and outgrowing my clothes at a amazin’ rate- and it was not fat either- it was all muscle. I hit a gym most of the day for about three weeks, I had so much energy! I was fucking my partner like a teenager again. I went and found some of the biggest, hairiest, most hung guys I could to wrestle and fuck with me. Man it was mad, everyone thought I was on some sort of drug, but I wasn’t – I simply couldn’t explain it. In the end the pressure was getting a bit much- everyone was on my case. I told my partner I had to leave and given he was more than a little freaked by my growth told me to git and call him when I was ‘off the juice’ “ Spud took a few seconds to laugh and swig his beer. <br />
<br />
“Thing is that was when the dreams started.” Spud leaned back and closed his eyes “I still get them now. I was always fishing, or running or standing on a mountain top. And I was always a Bear- always a Grizzly. Scared the crap out me at first, they where so fucking vivid. I’d wake up trying to eat the pillow or something. I got the hell out of the city about then too; it was too oppressive, too dirty. I ran north inta Canada, and I kept going until I hit nothing but wilds, nothing but me, animals and trees. Pristine. Empty of people.” suddenly Spud’s eye flew open and nailed Adam’s with a grey stare. “you have to see it man. You have too. It’s like nothing else- so quiet and peaceful“. He shook his head. <br />
“Is that where you first er…… changed?” said Adam finding his voice. <br />
“Yeah. One night four months after Mikal first fucked me. I was not alone though.” He took a swig of beer “out in the wilds I found another man. Indian by blood, though he wasn’t out there to ‘get back to nature’ or any of that crap, he was out there cos he was a Werebear and lived out in the wilds. I knew he was a Werebear the second I saw him, and he knew I was about ripe for the change the second he saw my muscles and smelt my musk. He took me in and took my though my first few changes. It was him that showed me all the meditations and stuff to help control my Beast. It was he that made me a Werebear not Mikal.” Spud went quiet and drank his beer not really looking at anything. <br />
<br />
“Why’d ya leave?” Adam prompted.<br />
“Cos Hank wasn’t gay. We’d play fight, we’d wrestle and stuff, but he would not cross a particular set of lines. I respected that, and though I got bigger than him he was much more experienced as a shifter, he knew tricks I am still figuring out. So I left. We still write and he’s even visited me in dreams a couple of times. A great Bear, one of the best.”<br />
<br />
“Why four months, I thought you got bit and changed at the next full moon?” Spud snorted<br />
“Don’t buy that Hollywood bullshit. For a start Luna don’t come inta it for Werebears, yeah she has a strong pull, esp when you first change, but after you gain control then she has nothing on you. The Bear is there when ever, you simply want to change and you do.” <br />
“Allright- what about Werewolves and stuff?”<br />
“Never met one. Hank was sure they exist, but one never came into his territory. He reckoned lycanthropy worked different to Ursanthropy” Adam cocked his head to one side<br />
“Ursanthropy?” he said with a light tone.<br />
“Someone who has the ability to turn from man to bear, just like lycanthropy is man to wolf.”<br />
“Ah”<br />
“Any other questions?”</p>
