<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Evelyn&#39;s eyes went wide, and her jaw dropped to the ground.  What the hell is she doing here, she thought.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou sat on the edge of the fence of Evelyn&#39;s enclosure, looking down at her. She looked around, ensuring that they were alone.  &quot;Surprised to see me?  I must say I am a little surprised to be here, too.  I had planned on running away as soon as I was out the gate, and never coming back to this wretched place.  But then things ...... changed, &quot; she said oddly.  Mary Lou threw another chunk of meat into the enclosure.  Evelyn&#39;s mouth began to water, but she made no move towards the food.  She was beginning to get very worried about what she had already eaten.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh relax, &quot; said Mary Lou.  &quot;It&#39;s just deer meat.  It&#39;s not poisoned or anything.  I mean, why would I want to hurt you after you helped me so much?  C&#39;mon ,eat it.  It&#39;s one of my favorite meals......well, I guess it WAS one of my favorite meals.  It&#39;s YOUR favorite now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn just sat silently, and stared at Mary Lou with cold unblinking eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be that way.  I had to do it.  You would have done the same thing.  You know what its like now.  And that was just one day. Imagine what it was like for me ......being trapped here for years. I had to escape by any means possible, &quot; said Mary Lou.<br />
<br />
Evelyn smelled a familiar scent, gradually getting stronger, and heard the footfalls of a second figure slowly approaching Mary Lou from behind.  As he rounded the corner, she saw that it was her boyfriend, Adam. He gave Mary Lou a hug, startling her a little, and then leaned down and kissed her passionately.<br />
<br />
&#39;What are doing here, honey?  With that thing!  &quot;  he said, glaring at Evelyn with hate in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just trying to reconnect with her, by bribing her with a little snack, &quot; said Mary Lou, with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;That monster shouldn&#39;t be rewarded.  After what it did to you, it should be put down!  Honestly, I still don&#39;t understand what you thought you were doing. Why did you take her out of her enclosure to bath her, and why didn&#39;t you sedate her?&quot; said Adam.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou just patted his hand softly.  &quot;It doesn&#39;t really matter now, honey, &quot; she said.  She kissed him again, more deeply and longer this time. &quot;I&#39;m almost done here. Why don&#39;t you finish up what you need to do and meet me at the car? We can go home, and maybe get a repeat of last night&#39;s fun and games.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam got a big smile on his face, and rushed off.  Mary Lou looked down at Evelyn, and saw that she was awestruck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be so surprised.  I&#39;m not a virgin, you know.  When I was smaller, and not quite as large as you are now, the zoo staff placed some bull alligators in my pen, hoping that we would breed. The first few times I tolerated it, but the experience was not pleasant for me. Those ignorant males just laid on my back like a lead weight, clumsily shoving their organs around me until they released their seed. I didn&#39;t feel any pleasure from the process. Later, when I was larger, I fought any male that the zookeepers placed in my pen - actually killed a few of the more aggressive and stupid ones - and the zoo staff eventually learned their lesson and stopped adding new males to my enclosure. &quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn was still confused.  She didn&#39;t understand what this had to do with Adam, her boyfriend.  Mary Lou continued her story. &quot;I didn&#39;t really miss the males. All they wanted to do was mate, and eat my food.  But, I did secretly desire something else.  You see, while I was in the zoo, I learned about how humans mated. I guess making love near us animals is some kind of thrill for you guys. Anyway,  like those annoying primates, humans made loud caterwauling noises, moans that sounded like it was enjoyable. Occasionally, I actually saw some humans making love, and the strange positions they used were confusing . They didn&#39;t seem to make sense, but by the smiles on their faces, it looked like those positions somehow increased the pleasure of mating. I have to admit, I was a little envious.  I mean, I could never try things like that in my massive, inflexible body, and it looked like it felt really, really good. I wanted to try mating like that for myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn was angry.  She began to grunt, and her massive tail began to thrash for side to side.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t like that, &quot; said Mary Lou, defensively. &quot;I didn&#39;t intend to mate with your boyfriend.  I really did just want to escape.  But it just sort of happened.  When he took me home, he was just so kind and comforting.  He helped me undress, and his skin was just so soft, his touch so enticing.  I began to feel a strange stirring in my groin.  He must have noticed, because then he kissed me - a deep, wonderful kiss - and from there we were off.  To the wildest, longest and best mating session I ever had.  We tried all the strange positions I had ever seen. It was even better than I had imagined.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn now thrashed wildly, whipping her large heavy tail against the fence with a thud, shaking it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now.  If you ever want to get out of here, you better be a good girl.  That is, if you ever want to see this &quot; said Mary Lou, as she held up a bottle of the indigo shampoo.  Evelyn immediately stopped banging the fence.  &quot;I thought that might get your attention.  Yeah, it&#39;s the reason I came back here today.  I couldn&#39;t have anyone else having a little accident like we did.  It might make Adam suspicious. I had originally planned to come back and get some to use on myself when I was safely in the  wild - maybe use a little on Adam so he could join you and keep you happy - but after my experience last night, I think I like being  this way -  being human.  And I definitely like Adam.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn began to growl softly.  &quot;Now, now. None of that, please. I promised to help you escape, and if you behave, I will.  But Adam is MINE now.  And if you can&#39;t get over that, then you can just stay here.  I overheard some of the staff talking, and I think they are going to try to breed you again.  Would like that? To try mating with one of those clumsy bull alligators?&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn stopped growling, and did nothing, just watch Mary Lou with her cold reptilian eyes.  &quot;I thought not. Just wait here, and relax.  The next time I have the night shift, we can work something out.  Maybe find another human that you can turn into ..... I don&#39;t know, I haven&#39;t worked out the details yet.  It shouldn&#39;t be more than a few days. Until, just enjoy yourself, &quot; said Mary Lou, as she stood up, threw the rest of the meat in the cage,  walked off towards Adam.<br />
<br />
Evelyn just sat in the dark and stewed.  There was no way she could trust Mary Lou.  And there was no way she would let her have Adam.  No, Evelyn was slowly forming her own plan.  She would have her revenge on Mary Lou, and it would be sweet.  She gobbled up the last few pieces of meat Mary Lou had thrown into her cage, and returned to her hidden spot in the enclosure to plan her revenge.</p>
