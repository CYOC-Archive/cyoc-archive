<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Henry Masters carefully studied his young teachers as they talked in an animated yet quiet manner. The four teen prodigies appeared quite worked up, anxiously seeing if anyone was listening. Concerned, he now asked the mentors to the young teens to meet with him. &quot;Have any of them said anything to either of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a peep,&quot; Greg shrugged. &quot;Ewart just said they met up with a new friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much what the girls told me,&quot; Denise added. &quot;All three of them though were really jumpy. It was almost like the three of them were worried they would get in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep me up to date,&quot; Henry stated. Nodding the two older teens exited the office, leaving Henry to his thoughts. Thoughts that were interrupted by an old friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Henry said wryly, a small smirk spreading across his face. &quot;Care to tell me what you and your new friends were up to Sachiko?&quot;<br />
<br />
The ghost fox now materialized, sitting on Henry&#39;s desk with a forlorn expression. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Heney,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;We were attacked by some strange men after we saw a movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everyone okay,&quot; Henry asked. Sachiko nodded, her head hanging low. Henry sighed, hugging his old friend tightly. &quot;I&#39;m glad your safe,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You&#39;re my oldest friend Sachiko, I&#39;d hate for anything to happen to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But your teachers could of been hurt,&quot; Sachiko sniffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;They weren&#39;t though and I have a feeling it&#39;s because of you. I&#39;m just glad all of you are okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
*************************************<br />
<br />
Akira took a deep breath as he approached the gates of Nakamoto estate. While he and his sister Aiko talked, he rarely saw her. After Villars defeat, Aiko was asked by the royal kitsune family to infiltrate the Yakuza to gain information on their enemies. Aiko entered into an arranged marriage with the son of the then boss of the family. The kitsunes job was to gather information, what wasnt expected was that she would fall in love.<br />
<br />
Aiko had found happiness as the wife of a crime boss and he with her. While the family was still Yakuza, Aikonhad influenced some changes. Drugs were now taboo, instead the Nakamoto clan dealt in black market magic. Things that were not easy to acquire or illegal. Couple that with gambling and Aiko had a hand in creating one of the most powerful crime families in the world.<br />
<br />
Still there were some downsides. The kitsune weren&#39;t exactly thrilled that a member of the clan was involved in crime. Even Ayami wasnt exactly thrilled, whenever Aiko visited, despite the two getting along quite well. <br />
<br />
With the passing of Aiko&#39;s husband, her eldest son now ran the business, with his mother acting as the matron of the family. As Akira now approached the gates in human form, he could see two guards watching him closely.<br />
<br />
&quot;What business do you have here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am here to see Lady Aiko,&quot; Akira stated. At the mention of Aiko&#39;s name, he could see the two guards tighten their grip on their submachine guns. &quot;Tell your mistress her brother is here to see her.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guards exchanged a confused look between one another before calling up to the house. In moments the gate swung open, Akira strolling inside as one if the guards continued to study him with some suspicion. As the gates closed Akira shifted into his anthro fox form as a middle aged man walk down the path. &quot;Uncle Akira what an unexpected surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ichiro,&quot; Akira exclaimed in surprise. &quot;My goodness! You look fantastic! How have you been nephew?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite well uncle,&quot; Ichiro smirked. &quot;One of mothers gifts has been an extended lifespan. 77 years old and I barely look 50. Come mother is expecting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As uncle and nephew walked they shared information. Ichiro, being the oldest, had taken over after the passing if his father. Since then the Nakamoto family had become known for their magic and power. No other family dare challenge their authority. &quot;How are Aunt Ayami and my niece?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is why I have come Ichiro,&quot; Akira said gravely. &quot;The Normal attacked Sachiko. I am hoping your mother can offer some information.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Normal,&quot; Ichiro exclaimed. &quot;They are but mongrel dogs. We had done some business with them, mostly weapons and some magic but no more. They shall pay for attacking ANY of our family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate that nephew,&quot; Akira smiled, bowing before the Yakuza boss. &quot;But tread carefully, I fear their may be more to this than the rabid dogs you have come to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they now made their way towards Aiko, Akira was able to learn more about the Yakuzas recent dealings with the Normal. The Normal had been more active in recent monthes, their purchases centering around necromancy. Unsure of why, Akira thanked his nephew as they now reached his sister.<br />
<br />
Aiko the five tail kitsune smiled, approaching her elder brother and hugging him tightly. &quot;You dont visit enough Akira,&quot; she smiled. &quot;You look well. How are Ayami and Sachiko?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are well,&quot; Akira stated. &quot;Their was an incident recently though. Sachiko was attacked by the Normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiko growled, apologizing and saying the Normal would be dealt with severely for threatening her favorite niece. &quot;What can you tell me of the Normal,&quot; Akira asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are fanatics,&quot; she scoffed. &quot;Obsessed with destroying anything not human. The money they offer though is good. Still, our people sometimes have their fun, dealing them defective magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would they try to take Sachiko,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont know,&quot; Aiko said. &quot;But even fanatics realize trying to destroy magic without magic is a losing effort. They may have been trying to take her to study or even use her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira nodded, the information may not of been much but it gave him some insight into the Normals motives. &quot;I thank you sister,&quot; he said bowing. &quot;You have been quite helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wish to help more,&quot; Aiko stated. &quot;And I think I have a perfect solution.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiko now waved her hand, producing a family photo. &quot;My youngest son Tomo,&quot; she said. &quot;Unlike his brothers, he choose not to follow his brothers into the family business. Still, he is protected by our clan, as are is grandchildren.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiko now pointed to a very pretty young teen. &quot;My great granddaughter is quite special,&quot; Aiko said with pride. &quot;The spirit of a kitsune warrior with a pure heart. Did you know she has always wanted to see America?&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira raised an eyebrow as he now studied his younger sister. &quot;What are you thinking Aiko?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My niece maybe safe for now Akira but we have both been in enough battles to know she is still in danger,&quot; she stated. &quot;My great granddaughter will be going to high school next year. I can not think of a better protector or a better opportunity to fulfill her wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira sighed, nodding as he realized what Aiko was proposing. Hopefully Yuriko wouldnt mind having another house guest to watch Sachiko and Darren.</p>
