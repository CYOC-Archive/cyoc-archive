<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You walk along the path behind Becky worried about getting lost. Several times the path branched off and you tried to memorize which branch she took. However you had more pressing worries than what path you were taking. You kept peering into the woods on either side of you alert for any signs of movement. You kept trying to tell yourself that the only movements you would see would be boys following you. You weren't succeeding and your thoughts kept turning to werewolves, vampires, and other monsters. It was getting dark and you were scared. Your breath was coming in short gasps and you could feel your heart beating very fast. Becky must have been afraid at least a little bit since she kept increasing her pace. She had broken into an almost run and you were afraid that you would lose her.<br />
<br />
Finally you came to another clearing and this one had a house in it. The house had one level to it that you could see but it seemed to be pretty big. You guessed that two average families would be able to live in it. Of course your perspective was different now and you could be mistaken. Upon gaining the clearing you hear a strange howl somewhere behind you. Both you and Becky momentarily freeze when you heard it. It was soon joined by a second strange howl. The second howl seemed to break her out of her fear induced paralysis. She yelled &quot;Run to the house!&quot; and broke into an all out run. You followed as quickly as you could though you couldn't run as fast with hugging your arms to your body and your shirt would likely trip you if you tried pumping your arms to run. With another howl that was closer you decide to abandon modesty and throw your shirt off.<br />
<br />
You were able to get your shirt off over your head with no trouble. As soon as it was off you broke into an all out run. Becky had been able to get in the house and was holding. &quot;Hurry up!&quot; she shouted fear evident in her voice. You heard something behind you and fear made you run even faster. You kept your focus on the open door, never looking back. You were afraid of what you would see and that it might cause you to freeze. You could literally hear the thing's breath right behind you. By now you were afraid that you would collapse and whatever was behind you would kill you. Becky's shout of &quot;You're almost safe! Just a little more!&quot; gave you enough incentive to dig down deep and keep going. The bright rectangle of the door was close now. You made it through and Becky slammed the door shut. Almost instantly you hear two thuds against the door.<br />
<br />
You assumed that you were safe now and sank down against a wall panting and shaking from the run and fear. Becky came over and sat beside you. She was evidently worn out also.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get your revenge on those boys Rebecca?&quot; an elderly female asked coming around a corner. This must be Becky's grandmother. Well, she was your grandmother now too.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was only able to transform two of them&quot; Becky said. &quot;I was interrupted before I could change the other two and I'm glad I was now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that Rebecca dear?&quot; your grandmother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The werewolves that were chasing us had the tusks of a boar&quot; Becky said.<br />
<br />
Your blood ran cold at Becky's words. You were being chased by werewolves. What was worse was that it sounded like the werewolves were Tom and Billy. &quot;That is disturbing news&quot; your grandmother said. &quot;The potion was made to turn humans into pigs. The fact that they are werewolves can have unforeseen effects. Hopefully the wards will keep them out for tonight. Tomorrow we'll move the house and hope they don't find us again. Now then, who's your friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my new twin sister Granma&quot; Becky said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Made a bet against Rebecca did you&quot; your grandmother said evidently addressing you. &quot;I can see that you're unable to speak right now so I'll ask Rebecca what the bet was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was the one that interrupted me&quot; Becky said. &quot;She had been an adult man. She had bet me that I couldn't change a person's age or sex. The terms were that if I couldn't I'd change Tom and Billy back but if I could that she would become my twin sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she have a new name yet?&quot; your grandmother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought Ma should give her her new name&quot; Becky said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea&quot; your grandmother said. &quot;Alice! Come here please!&quot;<br />
<br />
After a few minutes a younger woman came around the corner. She took one look at you and asked &quot;Why is she nude Rebecca?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her adult male clothes wouldn't fit her anymore Ma&quot; Becky said. &quot;She was wearing a shirt until we had to run.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you running from?&quot; your mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently werewolves&quot; your grandmother said. &quot;Werewolves that had been turned into pigs. We'll have to move the house tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see&quot; your mother said. &quot;So what's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Becky said you would give me one since you're my mother now&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the result of a bet&quot; your grandmother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see&quot; your mother said. &quot;Let's see. What should your name be. How about Elizabeth Lynn Amber Hood? That sounds like a good name. Welcome to the family Liz. Take her to your room and get her some clothes to wear Becky. I'll get one of the guest rooms ready for her. Now go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Becky stood up and you did too though you were shaky. Becky helped support you and guided you through the house. You passed by several rooms and it seemed that the house was bigger inside than it was outside. After a couple of minutes you came to a room with a name plate on it that said Rebecca Eryn Desiree. You giggled a little and said &quot;I just noticed that the initials in your name spell Red.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well where did you think I came up with it?&quot; Becky asked and opened the door. Her room had a lot of red in it. The carpet, walls, and bed spread were the same dark shade of red. The curtains were a lighter shade. The dresser was made from Redwood and a red doily was on top of it. Becky helped you to sit down on her bed and went to the dresser. She pulled out a pair of red panties, a pair of denim shorts, and a red short sleeve shirt. &quot;Do you want a training bra?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
You just shrugged your shoulders not knowing if you should have one or not. Becky took out a red bra too and brought everything over to you. &quot;They should fit fit you and the panties and training bra are brand new. I haven't worn them.&quot;<br />
<br />
You take the panties and slide them up your legs. You were surprised by how comfortable they were against your flat crotch. Becky showed you how to put on the training bra and after a little fumbling you managed to get it clasped. You pulled on the shirt and then the shorts. You looked at yourself in the mirror the Becky had in her room. You didn't look too bad being a girl. You had gotten your wish to return to the more carefree days of youth. You just didn't expect to be a girl. Though now that you look at yourself you think that this won't be so bad. You'll get to see what makes girls tick.<br />
<br />
Suddenly something crashes into the window making both of you jump. You looked out of the window and see something you had hoped you would never see. It looked like a wolf except that it had tusks growing from it's jaw and it's face had a trace of a pig's face in it. It's eyes were glowing red and this sent a jolt of fear down to the pit of your stomach. It kept throwing itself against the window and you thought that you saw the window crack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becky! Liz! Get to the basement now!&quot; your mother yelled in a panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put these sandals on!&quot; Becky said fear evident in her voice.<br />
<br />
You didn't argue as you put the sandals on and followed Becky. She stopped at a blank wall and said a word in a strange language. A door faded into view in the wall and when it was finished Becky pulled it open and headed down the steps that were behind it. Your mother and grandmother came around the corner and ushered you through the door. As they did you heard the sound of breaking glass. Your mother closed and locked the door and you hurried down the stairs as you knew the werewolves were in the house now. At the bottom your mother closed the door there and said a word in another language. The door faded from view leaving a solid wall behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're safe now&quot; your mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was afraid the wards wouldn't hold&quot; your grandmother said. &quot;Those werewolves aren't ordinary werewolves any longer. The potion Becky gave those boys was meant for humans, not werewolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we have some sort of hybrid that is strong enough to get past the wards&quot; your mother said. &quot;We'll have to do something about this before we move the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we give them the counter potion it should reverse the effects&quot; Becky said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That may work&quot; your grandmother said. &quot;If it doesn't we'll have to destroy them. There's nothing we can do tonight however. We might as well eat dinner then try to get some sleep. Hopefully they'll have reverted back by morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if they haven't?&quot; you asked a note of fear in your voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we hope that they still have a sensitivity to silver&quot; your grandmother said.<br />
<br />
You shudder at the thought of having to face them if they didn't revert.</p>
