<br />
The werewolf sighed as he looked at the piece of paper he had on his desk. Seeing the many attempts of him writing his name with his paw; the first attempt after breaking several pens and pencils with his strong grip, it looked like random scribbling, while his most recent attempt was somewhat legible. Despite printing his name instead of writing it in script; Ben could at least make out the line strokes for the first three letters of his name.<br />
<br />
So engrossed in his task; Ben wasn’t paying attention when there was a knock on the back door. Nor when the door was opened and someone entered. Ben was completely focused on his task at mastering writing while in his fursona, that he didn’t even stop when his mom’s kittens Jasmine and Saffron decided to curl up on his lap for a nap. So when Ben heard a cough coming from behind him; the werewolf reeled around to see a filthy looking Alex Ramsey staring at him. The two cats on his lap looking perturbed at having their nap disturbed with Ben’s sudden movement.<br />
“I tried knocking earlier but you didn’t answer,” Alex seeing a distracted werewolf; “did you talk to your mom’s about yesterday?”<br />
<br />
Ben knew what Alex was referring to. Yesterday, Ben had a job offer to work at Grrrrrrr rescinded when they received a shutdown order from the acting mayor Samantha Twist. Upset over the situation, Ben had a big fight with his mother about it when he got home. Storming out of the house and meeting up with Alex in a tent both set up in the woods after; both spending the night together under the stars in their fursonas despite the were-alert going on.<br />
“No,” Ben sighing; “I never got the chance. A few minutes after I walked in, Frances got a phone call and both my mom’s quickly left the house. But I did have a talk with mom before she left,” Ben absently scratching the cats sleeping on his lap; “this issue intends to be hashed out when they get back.”<br />
<br />
“So what has gotten you so distracted that you didn’t answer the door,” Alex entering Ben’s room.<br />
“See for yourself,” Ben handing Alex the sheet of paper; “and that’s just trying to write my name.”<br />
Alex looks at the scribbling on the paper. While he knows Ben isn’t illiterate, anyone else who saw this might not think so. Putting the paper down and looking at Ben in his lupine form, Alex knew what he was trying to do.<br />
“I remember those days,” Alex removing his clothes and quickly assuming his werewolf fursona; “after I had my first transformation, my parents made me spend at least an hour each day relearning to write with my paws. It was a miserable six months.”<br />
“You can write in your fursona,” Ben looking stunned.<br />
<br />
Alex just grunts as he grabs the one pen Ben hasn’t snapped and effortlessly writes his name is flowing script.<br />
“You remember when we first started getting serious,” Alex handing the paper back to Ben; “the days I would be a little irritable when we got together for a run?”<br />
“Yeah,” Ben looking at Alex’s signature; “you were really grouchy then. I just thought you were feeling confused about your sexuality.<br />
“No,” Alex scoffing; “I was just grumpy that my parent made me practice after I got my homework done. I couldn’t wait to run out into the woods and howl and run my frustrations away.”<br />
“My mom said that well loose some dexterity when shifting into our fursona,” Alex looking at his paws; “lose of fine motor control with our paws.”<br />
“Your mom is not wrong there,” Alex answering; “I’ve seen our pack leader Austin crush a plastic cup many times when in his fursona while trying to get a drink from the cooler.”<br />
“I don’t have that problem,” Ben chuckling; “nor handling cutlery with my paws. However,” Ben showing Alex the trash bin full of broken pens and pencils; “I just spent a good hour trying not to snap these in half with clawed thumb and forefinger.”<br />
<br />
Alex laughs; making the kittens in Ben’s lap wake up again. Gently picking up Jasmine; a grey furred kitten with beautiful blue eyes, Alex places the feline on the ground and then proceed to scoop up her brother Saffron. When Samantha picked up the kittens, Saffron had reddish orange eyes; finding out later that they were bloodshot and would clear up, the white furred kitten had gold amber eyes. Mewling as Alex place him on the ground; the werewolves chuckle as Saffron being a stubborn cat, jumps back onto Ben’s furry lap.<br />
“Looks like you have some completion Alex,” Ben chuckling; “Saffron likes snuggling with me.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Coming home after mowing the lawns and trimming hedges for a few clients requesting his services; Nate entered the home to see his parents in the were-fox fursonas stirring from their nap in the living room.<br />
“Don’t tell me you slept there the entire morning,” Nate looking at his parents getting up off the living room floor.<br />
“No,” Martha stretching; “only when we got back home around noon.”<br />
“I guess that means,” Nate taking his shoes off; “you two managed to have fun despite the were-club shut down.”<br />
“More than you had last night,” William grinning through his vulpine maw.<br />
“I don’t need the details,” Nate shaking his head; “but just to let you know, Jean is waiting for me upstairs and we about to have a little fun of our own.”<br />
“Jean is here,” William standing up; “we didn’t hear her come in.”<br />
“Guess we were really exhausted with what we did last night,” Martha giggling; “I haven’t napped that soundly since we became were’s.”<br />
“Before you run off and howl with wild abandoned,” William looking at his son; “sit down so we can talk.”<br />
<br />
Nate feeling a little nervous that his father wanted to talk to him; the werewolf reluctantly complies while William sits back down on the sofa.<br />
“What is this about,” Nate looking at his were-fox father.<br />
“It’s about making sure you have your priorities in the correct order,” Martha getting up as well.<br />
“Before you mother and I had our lovely nap,” William smiling at Martha before staring back at his son; “we wanted to sit down with you before you return to school this Tuesday. While we know your Landscape business is doing well,” William speaking; “you are still in high school and have a few years left to go before you graduate.”<br />
“You’re worried I might drop out and focus solely on my business,” Nate looking at his father.<br />
“The thought did cross my mind,” William looking serious; “can you imagine the embarrassment your mother and I would feel if you dropped out of school?”<br />
“The shame we would receive from our faculty peers,” Martha adding; “as we are both teachers.”<br />
“Our credibility would be shot to hell if our eldest son did graduate,” William looking stern; “And I’m not sure how Jean’s family would feel if they found out her husband is a high school drop out.”<br />
<br />
“We are technically only married in the eyes of nature,” Nate responding; “were-weddings aren’t exactly recognized by the state of Washington.”<br />
“True on that regard,” William commenting; “but never the less, while you are still in high school and living under my roof, your schooling comes first. No mowing lawns or raking leaves until you finish your homework and you at least maintain a C+ average.”<br />
“Only C+,” Nate cocking his eyebrow; “no high hopes of me getting straight A’s?”<br />
“The fact that you need Eric’s help in passing math and history,” William looking at Nate; “is not lost upon us.”<br />
“And your father and I will be having a similar talk with your brother,” Martha speaking; “once he finally shows up.”<br />
“And we are having a family dinner tomorrow evening,” William adding; “no excuses, you will be home tomorrow.”<br />
“No problem’s there,” Nate smiling; “Jean wants to spend the entire day tomorrow snuggled in bed with me.”<br />
“You’re not going to the picnic,” Martha looking at her son.<br />
“We’ll have our own picnic here,” Nate winking slyly.<br />
“Just try and not be too loud,” William speaking; “just in case our neighbor also decided to stay home.”<br />
“I’m sure the Twist’s will be attending the picnic,” Nate shaking his head.<br />
“Our other neighbor,” William answering; “the elderly normal that keeps calling to complain with all the noise going on over here.”<br />
<br />
Nate smiles as he gets up. Knowing that Jean loves to roar just as loud as he howls; Nate knows that neither will be able to keep quiet. Wondering if they should use the rec room as he heads upstairs to his room; all thoughts of taking the fun Jean had planned downstairs; go out the window as he opens the door to see Jean wearing a rather seductive nightie.<br />
<br />
Growling as he enjoys seeing Jean hiding her assets behind the sheer silk fabric that does little to conceal; Nate forgoes taking that planned shower as he quickly strips his clothes off and starts shifting into his werewolf form, his member already engorged and throbbing as it transformed into the lupine form that Jean loves entering her.<br />
“Now hold on hot stuff,” Jean holding up a hand and keeping the extremely happy werewolf from jumping on the bed to ravage her passionately; “before we begin, I want you to gently remove my sexy garment. I want to feel your paws rub up and down my silky smooth skin; toying and teasing my sensitive bits.”<br />
<br />
“So you want some foreplay,” Nate growling; his tail wagging like mad.<br />
“And when you bring me onto the cusp of an orgasm,” Jean getting up to place her hands on Nate’s furry chest; “and see me explode into my were-lioness fursona, that is when I want you to claim me.”<br />
“Grrrrrr,” Nate growls as he places his meaty paws on Jean; guiding her back to bed; “I can’t wait for what other fun things you have planned for today and tonight.”<br />
“I brought a little dinner,” Jean shuddering as Nate starts untying the strings holding up Jean’s nightie; “a couple of freshly killed rabbits to gnaw on afterwards.”<br />
“I’m going to gnaw on you first,” Nate staring at Jean’s exposed breasts and gently squeezing the inviting orbs with his paws; the nipples standing straight and true, begging to be suckled on.<br />
“Start slow,” Jean whispering in Nate’s lupine ears as he places his maw at one of the nipples and starts sucking and tickling the sensitive flesh with his tongue; “savor the snack before we go onto the main course my mate.”</p>
