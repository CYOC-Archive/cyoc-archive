<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fucking kid, so immature.&quot; Jeff scoffed, chuckling a moment later after realizing he called his dad a kid. Toiling it over in his mind, he pieced together that though he remains aware of how things use to be, this was probably how the perception shift works. He&#39;s still subject to his dad&#39;s new role, like everyone else, even though he knows what&#39;s normal. <br />
<br />
Understanding the situation gave him a little bit of comfort as he downed the rest of his breakfast. As fast as he could he ran upstairs to swap clothes and finish getting ready. It wasn&#39;t until he had a moment to think after getting onto the bus that he realized he had gone into the master bathroom and shaved... not that he needed to or anything like that... but a surprise addition to his routine, and inconvenient as he almost missed the bus.<br />
<br />
Arriving at school he dropped his supplies off at the locker and gathered what he needed for first period before finding his friends in the lunchroom, some of whom were eating breakfast. Despite having eaten less than an hour ago Jeff realized he could still eat and the cereal simply wasn&#39;t filling him up like usual. He found himself getting and devouring a school breakfast. <br />
<br />
First period, Statistics, was much the same as any other day except 25 minutes into class the door opened and a kid was walked in by the office administrator... <br />
<br />
&quot;We have a late enrollee. This is Matthew Brooks joining our senior class for his last year. Do you have it from here Mr. Arnst?&quot;<br />
&quot;I do, thank you Mrs. Lilly. Alright Matthew... Mr. Hodges, Could you see that our new student makes it to his next class?&quot;<br />
Jeff nodded and seats were rearranged so the pair would be next to one another. <br />
<br />
Class released and Jeff looked at Matthew&#39;s schedule, shadowing him to his locker and leading him to his next class. It was awkward when the senior replied &quot;Thank you Sir.&quot; and ducked into the class before Jeff could correct him. &#39;He must have forgotten my name.&#39; Jeff reasoned without much thought.<br />
<br />
After second period was break time, and despite himself, Jeff was ready for lunch. This wasn&#39;t too strange, often Juniors, Seniors, and those in a growth spurt (usually the male&#39;s) get lunch at this time and often also at noon. Its common enough that the school starts serving the standard lunch this early.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat down with his meal noticing he could finish the plate in about 8 bites... He was disappointed and thankful he would have another chance to get a meal at lunchtime. One of his friends joined him as the 10 minute warning bell sounded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I&#39;ve been meaning to ask you...&quot; Jeff looked up without pausing. &quot;So, like, since you have like, *real* relationship experience, how should I, you know, ask a girl out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Without really thinking Jeff finished chewing and gave his best advice, pointing out that he should pay attention to the girl&#39;s desire to be the center of attention and avoid any big displays if that isn&#39;t her thing, he elaborated on the importance of accepting rejection and being a responsible partner means contributing equally not just for meals and planning events together but sharing happy and sad moments and staying off your phone while together, as well as respecting his own boundaries and to cut things off if she&#39;s demanding too much from him. It was a really quick and simple 4 minute chat, &quot;Thanks Mr. Hodges.&quot; his friend said getting up to leave the cafeteria as Jeff was taking his tray back to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Jeff got several steps away before realizing what just happened and frowning... &#39;Lucas must be giving me a hard time, he must have felt embarrassed asking for advice so he&#39;s playing up how mature I am.&#39; Jeff wasn&#39;t all that convinced but he needed to get to his locker then to class.<br />
<br />
The next few classes were nothing special though Jeff couldn&#39;t seem to remain comfortable in the desk, his legs spilled out into the aisle and when he couldn&#39;t take up the aisle space he had to be careful not to knee the student in front of him or close his legs and crush his family jewels. Lunchtime came and Jeff managed to gobble down another meal but had 15 minutes to spare which he used to do the reading assignment for the next class.<br />
<br />
The next class was reading with Mrs. Holstein. Most of the guys rated her lower in the looks department, primarily because she had to be in her mid to late 30&#39;s instead of early to mid 20&#39;s. Most days Jeff shared that opinion but now the women seemed like kids that pass for teachers, but Jeff couldn&#39;t help but find Mrs. Holstein irrefutably attractive. The way she managed the class, how she carried herself, the fact that she wasn&#39;t a twig, the engaging discussion she carries coming from her life and classroom experience... if Jeff wasn&#39;t already married he&#39;d ask her out, maybe even just... &#39;Damn it&#39; Jeff gave himself an erection, thankfully reading class seldom involves getting up and walking around the classroom.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s final class was gym. Often he felt uncomfortable changing with other guys around but today he felt like he had nothing to be ashamed of, especially surrounded by children. He removed his shirt and dislodged his shoes while approaching his locker. He sat on the bench and leaned forward entering the combination on the cheap lock. He pulled out his gym clothes, tossed his shoes and shirt in and and  pulled of his shorts, realizing for the first time they had been uncomfortably tight.<br />
<br />
Jeff paused for a second, remembering the shorts fitting fine last wash cycle and having a moment of confusion at reading the size 26 waist, knowing it should say 36... Jeff grabbed the size large basketball shorts and slipped them up his hairy legs, not realizing the hair no longer stopped at his thighs. Jeff scratched at his solid waist, not thinking it strange that the 2pk abs he had once hoped to nurture were now hidden under a modest beer belly and he had a carpet of hair reaching up to his pecs but stopping abruptly at that point. <br />
<br />
The bending motion moved the contents of Jeff&#39;s insides, he released a hot belch and he felt everything move within him. A second later he realized he needed to stretch and after a few contortions he managed to crack his lower back several times unaware he was now just an inch or so from reaching his final adult height. He finished getting dressed for gym, his shoes were tight and the shirt was short and tight in the belly but manageable. Jeff didn&#39;t feel like doing cardio and sweating, so he opted to join the group in the weight room.<br />
<br />
His lower body strength had seemed to double overnight and as he move to chest exercises, each set seemed to start at his physical limit and become laughably easy by the end. He didn&#39;t piece together the muscles being used were at the location of his physical transformation as he was using them, helping to spur his transformation forward.<br />
<br />
By end of class, he had meaty pecs coated in dense manly fur, but he had worked his biceps before chest and was left with the pumped, but spindly arms of an untrained teen. Jeff had drank nearly a gallon of water throughout class. Though the Chronivac had set his body up to transform in this way, being outside of its range forced him to use his own resources to fuel the changes, hence his appetite and desperate need for fluid as his body turned fat into cells and filled them with plasma, dehydrating him.<br />
<br />
Jeff got on the bus still wearing his gym shorts and shirt since the outfit he wore to school was too tight. If he was being honest, his underwear was cutting into him and he couldn&#39;t wait to get home. The bus ride itself was a new form of torture. He couldn&#39;t fit in the seat facing forward and had to spread one leg each direction or he&#39;d be crushing his package. He looked apologetically at the freshman forced to share a seat next to him. Between the two people and two bookbags in the seat it was an extremely unpleasant ride home, though, nobody&#39;s fault.</p>
