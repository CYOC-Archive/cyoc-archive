<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley was quietly contemplative as she considered the vast array of possible choices for a penis. She couldn&#39;t stop thinking about what Jeff had told her that his vagina was Alexandra&#39;s originally before he swapped genitals with her. It was kind of making her aroused thinking that the very penis she&#39;d been envious to have one just like had been her current boyfriend&#39;s former male glory.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d very quickly said that she thought she wanted to keep her own vagina to make things easier, but the more she thought about how much of a role model Alexandra has been for her she started to think about all the little boys that might deserve a similar role model to be more like her interesting and unusual boyfriend. She was starting to think it might be worth giving up her own vagina for a cause like that.<br />
<br />
Finally she spoke up, a little quietly, not feeling entirely confident in her answer but it was starting to sound like one of the most interesting options to her, &quot;Do you know Greg the Pipe Fitter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course Jeff knew of Greg the Pipe Fitter. Just about everyone knew of Greg the Pipe Fitter. He was only a mid-tier male porn star at best, but he was currently in the middle of a string of straight porn hits. He was known for being extremely well hung, and that was currently the fad from one of the studios: &quot;almost too big to fit&quot; was very in right now. Greg&#39;s first few movies that got him his nickname were all plumbing themed, he&#39;d come in and try to fit his pipe in all the available holes in a house, sometimes almost unsuccessfully. Jeff wasn&#39;t sure that famous pipe could be fitted between his legs, but he was growing aroused thinking about trying. &quot;You want to copy Greg the Pipe Fitter&#39;s cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley shook her head, &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about Alexandra again and how much I wanted that growing up and I want guys to have someone famous like that too. More guys should want to look sexy in a thong like my hot boyfriend. I think I want to swap entirely with him like you did with Alexandra.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t sure about messing more with the timeline, but he had promised Ashley just about whatever she wanted, and he thought it would be hot to see how a famous porn star adapted to very different genitalia. He made sure to set the Chronivac so that just the two of them together would notice the change and then like he had with Alexandra pulled up a web search of Greg the Pipe Fitter to better see some of the changes immediately. He squeezed Ashley&#39;s hand and made the swap.<br />
<br />
The first obvious change was that Greg the Pipe Fitter was now called Pipe Layer Greg. Still best known and nicknamed for a series of plumbing themed porn films early in his career, they were know about all the pipe he could lay between his legs. Jeff was surprised to notice first that Pipe Layer Greg&#39;s filmography had gone way up, including some Oscar nominated performances in non-porn films most recently under his real name (&quot;Stanley Gregory&quot; Ashley laughed out loud at that). Without just relying on the one and only shtick of just having a massive penis, Pipe Layer Greg had to do a lot more diverse work than just boring regular straight porn or even just regular gay porn. There were lots of &quot;straight with a lesbian twist&quot; encounters and &quot;gay with a straight twist&quot; and shemale porn and even wilder things that would not have occurred to Jeff. But the biggest surprise of course was that to really play up the &quot;I&#39;m a big guy here to fix your plumbing&quot; into the &quot;but I have a secret and I need to lay that pipe right inside of me, right now&quot; had forced Pipe Layer Greg to really level up his acting skills to keep getting more film work and apparently enough to eventually make the switch to real Hollywood and something of a &quot;leading man&quot; status that Jeff found incredible.<br />
<br />
Jeff was curious to look up more about how Stanley &quot;Pipe Layer&quot; Gregory had made that change into a respectable actor, but was quickly distracted by some of the other changes around him. It didn&#39;t seem to affect Ashley&#39;s wardrobe much: she was still wearing the same &quot;I know I&#39;m a hot cheerleader but I&#39;m off duty right now&quot; casual pink crop top and ruffled red skirt. She was deliberately manspreading now and it was immediately visible to Jeff that Ashley was now wearing the exact same brand of men&#39;s boxer briefs that Alexandra models. Even somehow limp and not yet aroused, it was a very impressive sized bulge on Ashley&#39;s frame, and the way the ruffles of her skirt also seemed to be having trouble stretching across it, even though it was not a very tight skirt. But before Jeff could dwell to much on that impressive bulge he was distracted by the changes to his own room and wardrobe and self.<br />
<br />
A big poster in a prominent spot in Jeff&#39;s bedroom had changed to a film poster from some random action movie starring Stanley Gregory. As Jeff stood to examine the poster in a bit more detail he realized the pants he was now wearing were a lot tighter than what he had been wearing before the swap just now. They were especially stretched real tightly across the crotch making it nearly impossible to keep the secret of what was between his legs now. They were also stretched tightly around way more defined muscles than he expected himself to have. Apparently having an action film role model in this timeline shifted some of Jeff&#39;s gym and sports habits. Jeff opened his pants drawer to find most of his pants looked a lot skinnier and tighter. There were even some kilts and skirts mixed in to Jeff&#39;s even greater surprise. Jeff got a feeling that he definitely wasn&#39;t keeping anything a secret now.<br />
<br />
While Jeff had been exploring his bedroom and wardrobe changes. Ashley had snuck up on Jeff to give him a hug from behind. She was mostly using it as an excuse to feel his larger muscles under his shirt. Jeff was very aware of the growing erection against his pants and back. &quot;See,&quot; Ashley said as she continued to feel up various muscle groups on Jeff that she was curious to feel, &quot;it really was a good idea to give more role models to hot boys like you.&quot;</p>
