<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, Jake, have you seen my iPod?&quot; Dan asked his brother.<br />
<br />
Dan and Jake were identical twins. So identical, in fact, that they had to wear different necklaces for people to tell them apart. Even <br />
their parents got confused quite often. They looked the same, sounded the same, acted the same, and even thought the same. They <br />
could even &quot;read&quot; each others' minds because they knew each other so well. They had the exact same friends, the same hobbies, and <br />
they were both in the same sports. They were best friends and did everything together. The only difference between them was the <br />
different necklaces they wore. Jake wore a wolf tooth necklace while Dan wore a Chinese coin necklace. It was the only way for most <br />
people to tell them apart short of wearing name tags.<br />
<br />
And, of course, as twins they shared a birthday. That's what was going on right now. Their parents were taking Dan and Jake to do <br />
their favorite thing for their birthday. They were driving from their home in Virginia Beach to the scenic mountains of West Virginia. They <br />
had a camp up there where the boys could hike, explore, and do pretty much anything. But before they could leave, they had to pack. <br />
<br />
Jake thought for a moment before he replied, &quot;I think you left it—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On the desk,&quot; the two twins said in unison.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the music device was sitting on the work desk the boys used for homework. Dan grabbed the iPod along with their <br />
videogames and laptop. This week was going to be nonstop fun! Exploring the woods all day and staying up to play video games at <br />
night! What more could a 15-year-old boy want?<br />
<br />
After packing their clothes, toys, games, food, and a week's worth of whatever they thought they would need, the Bronson family was <br />
ready to go. They loaded up into the family's SUV and headed west. <br />
<br />
After five hours of driving, the SUV pulled up to the Bronsons' cabin. The cabin had a full first story with a kitchen, living room, <br />
bathroom, and bedroom. It also had a loft room where the twins slept. To the young boys, the loft was like a super-secret cave where <br />
they could do whatever they wanted. The cabin was well-insulated, so anything short of screaming couldn't be heard downstairs. Up <br />
there, they could talk like all teenage boys talk when their moms can't hear them. <br />
<br />
The cabin was part of a larger campground, but the sites were a good 100 yards apart on either side. Furthermore, their camp was the <br />
last in the line, so they only had one neighbor.<br />
<br />
As the Bronsons drove down the dirt road to the cabin, they saw that said neighbors were also at camp. The Kaisers were a family of <br />
five. Mr. and Mrs. Kaiser lived up by Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and each of them had busy lives. Their oldest child, Kate, was 18 and <br />
extremely hot. She was captain of her school's volleyball team and her class's valedictorian. This was her last summer vacation before <br />
she went to college. Jason, the middle son, was 16. He was a handsome kid on the highschool football team and his grades were pretty <br />
much the same as Kate's. He was fun to hang around with, but sometimes he tried to act too much like an adult. Marcus was the <br />
youngest at 15, the same age as the twins. He was their best friend apart from each other. Marcus was athletic like his siblings, and <br />
smart too; but not to the extent they were. He got honor roll all the time, but he definitely wasn't the top of the class. <br />
<br />
Jake and Dan were excited to see that the Kaisers were there. While their neighbors came up almost every weekend in the summer, the <br />
Bronsons only came up once or twice, usually for whole weeks. Even when their vacations coincided, they only got to spend a few days <br />
together. So as soon as they got unpacked, Dan and Jake ran to the Kaiser camp to see Marcus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! If it isn't the twin terrors!&quot; Mr. Kaiser answered the door. &quot;Marcus's mom just started supper, though, so you'll have to wait to see <br />
him. But I'll tell him you guys are here and he can come over once he's finished. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sir!&quot; Jake replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Mr. Kaiser!&quot; Dan added.<br />
<br />
The two went back to their own cabin to find that their parents had finished unpacking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back so soon?&quot; their dad asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Kaisers were about to eat supper,&quot; Dan answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, so are we,&quot; their father replied, &quot;Your mom went down to the office to check in, so she'll be back in a while. I'm going into town to <br />
pick up Chinese food for supper, since you two like it so much. Unless you wanted warm hotdogs as your birthday dinner. Will you guys <br />
be alright by yourselves until your mom gets back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet, dad!&quot; they answered together.<br />
<br />
Their dad took the SUV and drove out of the campground while the twins went inside. They began to unpack their clothes and games <br />
when there was a knock on the door. <br />
<br />
Expecting it to be Marcus, they ran downstairs to answer the door; but no one was there. Instead, a large package lay on the cabin's <br />
porch. It was addressed to Dan and Jake Bronson.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did anyone send us something up here?&quot; Jake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Dan replied, &quot;Nobody knows who owns these cabins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's addressed to us, though,&quot; Jake reasoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, let's take it up to the loft.&quot;<br />
<br />
The twin boys brought the box up to their loft and opened it. Inside was a CD, some cables, and a remote-like thing. There were also <br />
instructions. Reading them told the twins that the CD contained the program Chronivac 5.0 which could scan anything you chose and <br />
transform it into anything else. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like a game someone wants us to test,&quot; Dan suggested. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jake agreed, &quot;Looks like a high-tech avatar maker or something. Wanna try it out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
They plugged in the laptop and put the CD in. The program took a surprisingly short time to load. Then a screen popped up requiring <br />
them to plug in the remote (the instructions called it an emitter) and scan themselves. They did so and saw two new screens pop up. <br />
One had an image of Dan and the other was Jake. However, both pictures were naked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah,&quot; Dan exclaimed, &quot;How did it do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe this isn't a game,&quot; Jake said, &quot;Maybe it's something porn makers use.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; they said together. <br />
<br />
The instructions said that they could change themselves in any way imaginable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's change your character first, Jake!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot;<br />
<br />
They maximized the screen with Jake's picture on it. It was exactly like someone had taken a picture of Jake without any clothes on. <br />
underneath the picture was a box with all of his stats on it and below that was a list of change options. <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Dan started, &quot;What do you want to change about your character?&quot;</p>
