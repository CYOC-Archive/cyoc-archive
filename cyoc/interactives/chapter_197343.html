<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frost felt free, truly free, for the first time in her life. Her ascension had dispelled the veil of arrogance, and now she truly understood that nothing in this world could stand against her. Her whole humongous body was buzzing with nervous energy, untapped magics coursing through her. Millions of thoughts ran through her vast mind, already making plans, calculating the effects of her actions years into the future.<br />
<br />
But she decided to start small: Take revenge on those miserable runts that had abandoned her.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Whitefang, Blizzard and Flurry were lazing around as always, enjoying their day. Blizzard was gnawing on a mountain goat he&#39;d caught, and Flurry was helping Whitefang polish his scales.<br />
<br />
None of them had any time to react as a huge dragoness crashed next to them, her body easily eclipsing the smaller mountain they were resting on. Instinctually, all the dragons stopped what they were doing and dropped down into a bow, spreading their wings in an absolute display of subservience. It took them a little while to actually figure out what had just happened. The power radiating from the dragoness was so overwhelming that their instincts overpowered their rational minds. They were absolutely in awe. But also terrified.<br />
And Frost couldn&#39;t be happier about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha...hahahahaaaaa!&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragons lifted their gaze as the giant in front on them let out a booming, but also commanding and melodious laugh. They could almost swear the her mere voice was making the air around them grow colder.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, now the worthless wyrms who left me to eradicate the humans bend the knee? Pathetic.&quot; She finally said.<br />
<br />
A spark of recognition went through their minds. The young dragoness that&#39;d been pestering them, last seen days ago. It couldn&#39;t be...<br />
<br />
&quot;Frost?&quot; Blizzard asked out loud, finally baring the gaze of the dragoness.<br />
<br />
A loud WHOOSH was heard as Frost moved faster than the eye could see. Whitefang and Flurry immediately registered that her claws were now coated in blood. Fear welled inside of them as they turned to look where Blizzard had prostrated only seconds prior, only to discover absolutely nothing there except for his prints. The lumbering dragon had been completely annihilated.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s goddess to you, worms.&quot; Frost replied calmly, licking the blood off her fingers.<br />
<br />
The synapses of the remaining two were firing faster than ever before, the danger they were in becoming immediately apparent. Whitefang didn&#39;t waste time as he turned tail and ran, spreading his wings as he dove off the cliff in an effort to escape the primordial dragon.<br />
<br />
Frost looked on at his flight, unimpressed. She hardly even moved as she exhaled in his general direction.<br />
<br />
Whitefang was beating his wings, desperately trying to put distance between himself and the gigantic monster. He had to get away. Had to warn everyone. Had to...<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t get very far as the beating of his wings began to slow down and a deathly chill came over his body. He craned his neck to witness ice quickly covering his form, and then going deeper than that. The shock had barely begun as he realized that the ice was transmuting his very flesh before it reached his brain, turning the entire dragon into an ice sculpture that quickly plummeted to the ground, shattering into millions of pieces upon impact.<br />
<br />
Frost scoffed. Coward didn&#39;t even have the decency to face her as he died. Then she turned her attention to the remaining dragon.<br />
<br />
Flurry was (figuratively) frozen in the spot, not daring to take a single step. He&#39;d seen how easily Frost had defeated his comrades. He knew he was done for. He cast one last defiant gaze at the goddess, not uttering a word.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, she was smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s more like it. An actual dragon, not a winged cockroach. Prideful even in the midst of imminent doom, even while he&#39;s shivering in fear. I need more like you for my new empire. In fact...&quot;<br />
<br />
Frost began to eclipse the mountain even farther as she rose even higher, her very being blocking out the sun above as the climbed on top. Flurry could see her lumbering form, about to crush him.<br />
<br />
&quot;...I think I&#39;ll keep you. I always thought you were the cutest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frost crashed down, her crotch right over the small dragon. Flurry didn&#39;t even have time to yell as her huge womanhood engulfed him, soaking him in freezing juices. He tried to struggle out, but Frost was too strong, her feminine tunnel pulling him further and further in, blocking off any chance of escaping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be honored, Flurry. You shall be the first creature in history to be granted a second birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frost took flight, returning to her lair. She could already feel new instincts blossoming within her. The instinct to nest.<br />
<br />
Inside of her birth canal, Flurry was being manhandled by her inner muscles. Deeper and deeper he fell, until at last he emerged in a humongous cavern. Her womb.<br />
<br />
He was tired, deathly tired, from struggling against her. He was soaked, covered in her juices. And he was cold. So cold, immensely cold. Frost was colder than anything he had ever felt. Exhausted, he slumped down, curling up onto the floor of her womb. He was soon asleep, at the mercy of Frost&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
The primordial magics within her body wasted no time as they got to work. The juices covering the unconscious drake began to harden as more and more flowed down, filling the womb with fluids that would&#39;ve frozen a regular creature to death within seconds. Flurry was encapsulated, the fluids freezing around him into an elliptical shape, until he was encased in an egg, safely floating within the womb.<br />
<br />
Frost arrived at her lair and immediately laid down, releasing even more coldness as the entrance to the mountain was sealed shut. She curled up, growling happily as a piercing chill emanated from her stomach. This was a moment every dragoness dreamt of their whole life. The joy of becoming a mother.<br />
<br />
Days went by, Frost nurturing the developing life within her as Flurry was being bombarded with her essence. The egg was feeding from the pure  essence of a primordial dragon, thousands of blizzards and winter nights suffusing Flurry as his container fed him the power of his new mother, overtaking his previous parents as he was remade.<br />
<br />
Had someone been able to see into the egg, they would&#39;ve witnessed flashes of the most incredible metamorphosis in the darkness of the womb. Old hands getting torn apart as new ones, much larger and possessing sharper claws, burst through them.<br />
Old scales flaking off, new diamond-hard ones growing in their place. His entire body stretching larger from growing muscles as the egg grew to compensate, freezing more fluids to house the developing dragon.<br />
<br />
And soon, not a trace of the old Flurry would remain.</p>
