<br />
<br />
<br />
Dustin had been stroking both of his new cocks, and the pleasure of it was many times more intense than anything he had ever felt. He felt himself getting close to shooting his loads. Dustin was so into stroking that he didn’t realize his cocks were merging into one large one<br />
<br />
Jack still felt like he was going to throw up, but rather than feeling bad, it was feeling really good. Then his &quot;mouth&quot; opened up and he was shooting everywhere. The stream was soaking the rest of the team in cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck, dude!&quot; cried Randy, one of the other basketball players. The rest of the team was also rather upset by the fact that they were now covered in gallons of cum.<br />
<br />
Jack was feeling exhausted after shooting so much, but suddenly felt an odd sensation. He looked and saw he was starting to grow bigger, but he was already hard. It seemed he was growing in size. At first he hoped that maybe he was returning to normal, but his hopes were soon dashed, as the growth stopped almost as soon as it had begun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, look at your cock Dustin&quot; cried Zak, &quot;it’s huge now!&quot; Sure enough, the cock that was Jack had merged with Dustin's original cock, however it was now uncircumcised, and had doubled in length.<br />
<br />
Then the rest of the boys started feeling weird. All of them were getting really aroused. Their cocks were all hard and leaking pre-cum like crazy. Dustin had also started to feel horny as well, but was still tired from his ordeal. The boys had started rubbing their chests, and muscles, all of them groaning as the pleasure just from that was becoming more intense.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Randy started coming, shooting a huge load, that was quickly washed down the drain by the showers. Randy, tired from his orgasm, sat down against the wall and watched the others as they stroked their lean muscles in the showers. Over the next couple minutes the rest of the boys in the room had shot their own loads, and were relaxing. <br />
<br />
However, they were all still feeling really horny. Randy reached down to stroke his cock, but when he felt his groin, something was wrong. He looked down and saw that his cock was grown in size. &quot;What the fuck is going on!&quot; Randy screamed. The rest of the boys looked, and saw that Randy's cock was now as long as his legs and almost as big. They quickly checked their own cocks, and to their joy, many of them had cocks growing in size and the others' cocks were rapidly growing larger.<br />
<br />
Shortly after their cocks enlarged their horniness started to increase rapidly. They couldn't help but stroke their bodies, and even started to stroke each others' bodies. Then Zak was the first of them to cum this round. His orgasm was even more intense than his last orgasm. He felt weak in the knees and sat down next to Randy.<br />
<br />
While this was going on, Dustin had continued to stroke his cock while watching the hot scene in front of him. Wait where did that come from, Dustin had never thought of himself as gay, but watching his teammates stroking each others' bodies to orgasm, he couldn't help but be aroused.<br />
<br />
After a couple dry orgasms, Zak had another orgasm, but this time he threw up a load of cum out of his mouth. He couldn't believe his eyes, then he saw his legs. They had begun to fatten themselves up. He wanted to stop, but he just couldn't help himself as he continued to stroke his chest and abs. With Randy helping him he didn't last long. Then Randy threw up a load of cum too, and shortly there after the other boys were throwing up loads when they came.<br />
<br />
Much like Jack had felt when he came as a cock, the boys felt really good when they threw up the loads. Jack from his perspective on Dustin was watching in horror as every limp of school basketball team was slowly turning into cocks. By now most of their legs had been replaced by giant cocks with a giant set of balls between their main cock and some like Zak were further along.<br />
<br />
Zak looked with a horrified, his abs slowly lost definition and started to look more like the shaft of his own cock. Shortly thereafter his arms started to grow into huge cocks. He thought he might be safe, as long as he wasn't able to stroke himself to an orgasm, but then he felt himself start building to another orgasm. He shot his load spontaneously out of every cock including the one that was now his head.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, the whole team, except for Dustin had been turned into cocktopi versions of their own cocks. Then all the man-sized cocks started cumming. Most of the cum running down the drain, but a lot of it running over the divider and into the rest of the locker room.<br />
<br />
All the boys minds still remained in their cocks, and Dustin found himself sticky with cum, standing in a room with his teammates, now reduced to nothing more than animals  made up of cocks, licking up the cum that was strewn about the floor.<br />
<br />
Dustin then started stroking the head cocks of the creatures loping about  the floor, Each one he touched spewed out more cum onto the floor which the others eagerly licked it up. While thinking of what sorts of fun he could have with them Ty walked in with his own octopus.</p>
