<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachael frantically drove down the road away from the apartments. <br />
<br />
&quot;What had happened back there?&quot; Rachael thought. &quot;Was what I saw and felt even real? It couldn&#39;t have been, could it? Did my boyfriend really just turn into a horse man? How? I mean I know I put those pills in his drink but those couldn&#39;t have done all that, could they?&quot; <br />
<br />
Rachael continued to try and comprehend just what had happened to her boyfriend. She kept driving, not really having a destination in mind, anywhere away from the apartment was all she cared about. A few miles away from Mikes place Rachael finally started to calm down. Her breathing slowed to a more normal pace. She noticed that her pants felt a little tight. &quot;I must not have pulled them up all the way when I was running for my life.&quot; she mumbled to herself trying to explain away the uncomfortable feeling. <br />
<br />
Rachael began to feel a tingling sensation and a heat began to spread out from her groin. Unbeknownst to her there was a fine layer of short chestnut fur pushing it&#39;s way out of her skin. Rachael&#39;s new fur began it&#39;s march over the rest of her body by spreading up her back and down her legs. Everywhere the fur grew muscle expanded and multiplied underneath. Rahael didn&#39;t notice just how tight her pants were getting, or how her shirt was being stretched to it&#39;s limit. She just felt a dull itch washing over her and her thoughts began to dift back to Mike.<br />
<br />
Rachael began thinking again. &quot;What had really happened to Mike? Will he be ok? Is my Mike still even in there? He certainly seemd like he was. It was me running away from him. I wonder if he even knew what had happened to him. How could he not?&quot; She thought about the changes he had gone through. &quot;He had to have known his hands only had three digits and he had to have known his body had grown fur. What if he didn&#39;t though? Well some of the changes he might not have noticed. Like how he&#39;d gotten taller and more defined...&quot; <br />
<br />
Rachael thought about his new stature and his firm pecks. Not all of his changes were bad, considering how jacked Mike was now. He could probably lift her over his head with one hand. She remembered how it felt when Mike had wrapped his big arms around her and his new muscles had rippled under her touch. She thought about how she had straddled him and felt the raw power he had in his core. Then there was the black fur that had coated his body. It&#39;s coarse texture tickling her skin as he had penetrated her entrance. His long thick sha... <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT ARE YOU THINKING!? Snap out of it! He&#39;s a monster!&quot; Rachael yelled to herself. She slammed back to reality and hit the brakes. She pulled over to try and get her bearings. &quot;I&#39;m lucky he didn&#39;t kill me!&quot; She tried to convince herself even while her pants dampened from the wetness starting to seep out of her sex. &quot;He&#39;s so strong now. He&#39;s probably lost his mind.&quot; She tried to fight against her feelings. &quot;Why can&#39;t I get him out of my head?! Fuck! Why is it turning me on so much? Just the thought of his long, thick cock and the feeling of his strong muscles underneath his short dark fur... What!? Stop! Why are you fantasizing about him?&quot; She thought to herself. &quot;You just ran away from him, he was terrifying! <br />
<br />
&quot;Terrifyingly strong and handsome that is.&quot; Rachael answered herself. She couldn&#39;t stop herself from thinking about him and what she would give just to be back in his arms. Rachael heard her clothes start to rip apart from her expanding physique. Her arms and shoulders burst out of her clothes. The taters of clothing fell off of her enlarged frame to reveal her now broad, muscular shoulders. Her neck had thickend quite a bit and long hair had started growing along the back of it. &quot;Shit! It&#39;s happening to me too!&quot; Rachael said out loud but with less fear in her voice than before. She looked down and saw her breasts growing, pushing against gravity, getting bigger and bigger. Rachael reached up and cupped them in her deforming hands. Her nipples turned dark and stiffened. At her touch, waves of pleasure washed through her body. A virtual waterfall gushed from her crease. &quot;Oh fuck!&quot; Rachael gasped and a musky smell began to waft it&#39;s way up from her groin. The scent was intoxicating, sending her further into the euphoric thralls of her transformation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t he tell me how good this felt?&quot; She asked. <br />
<br />
By this point Rachael was completely covered in short chestnut fur. Her fur did noting to hide the extreme definition of her new muscles. Rachael&#39;s previously slight build was gone. She was shredded. Her legs finished turning into an unguligrade stance with hooves and a short tail nub was beginning to dig into the fabric of her seat. Rachael tried stretching out but found that she was now crammed in her car. Her larger body unable to move properly inside her small economy hatchback. She struggled to open the car door with her thick stubby fingers. Finally succeeding, Rachael practically popped out of her car. Rachael was finally free of the confines of her car. She arched her back and stretched. She pushed her enhanced chest out and leaded back. Rachael could feel every tendon and joint pop and move, conforming to her new build. The pants she had thrown on while running away burst to reveal her new legs and long dark tail. Rachael looked down and saw that her nose was looking bigger. She reached up and explored it&#39;s contour with her large stubby fingers. She could actually feel the bones in her face pushing forward and the skin stretching to cover it&#39;s new length. Her nostrils enlarged and as they did Rachael started to notice different smells that she didn&#39;t even know existed. Her tongue fell out of her mouth, elongating, while the rest of her face tried to keep up with it.  Deep in her mind Rachael felt everything click. She knew she had finished changing so she lifted her head to the sky and let out a triumphant &quot;NEEEEEIGH!&quot; She felt amazing, so alive but also so needy. <br />
<br />
Finally Rachael couldn&#39;t take it anymore and she reached a hand down to her slit. She stroked her soaking folds slicking her new digits. She plunged her finger within herself. Waves of of ecstasy washed over her as she ravaged herself. Using her other hand she kneaded her breasts and pinched her rock hard nipples. She continued this over and over but was not able to finish. It just wasn&#39;t there. <br />
<br />
It was torture to Rachael. She needed something else, or someone else. Maybe she could get back to Mike and apologize for leaving. She knew she could handle him now, hell, she wanted him more than anything now. But she was on the side of the road and who knows where. There was no way she was fitting back in her car but maybe she could find someone to help her, or maybe she could find some other was back to Mike.</p>
