<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up to someone knocking on your door. At first you don't know where you are but you quickly remember that your in your room. That dream had seemed so real but you know that you weren't a grownup and definitely not a boy. You look around your room just to confirm that you are you. Your room is that of a typical eight year old girl. You have a four poster bed with pink lace curtains, a pink and violet dresser, a pink toy chest with princess and your name written on it in violet letters, there are posters of Hanna Montana on the pink walls, and a walk-in closet in which you knew were all your pretty dresses and shoes.<br />
<br />
There was another knock on your door though this time your mommy said &quot;Get up Violet. Today is the day we're going to the water park. Your dad wants to get going soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm up Mommy&quot; you say and immediately think that your voice is different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get ready to go then. Put on your swimsuit under your dress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy.&quot; Once again you think that your voice is strange but you know it's not. If it had been your mommy would have said something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't forget to brush your teeth princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't Mommy.&quot; You still think that your voice sounds strange. You're still a little sleepy so it must be your imagination. Your mommy would tell you that.<br />
<br />
You get out of bed and go to the bathroom. You really needed to go potty and you didn't want to have an accident. You just make it to the potty when you couldn't hold back any more and went number one. Your glad that you made it and didn't have an accident. Mommy would have been mad about that. You finish going number one and you didn't need to go number two so you take some toilet paper and wipe. You almost leave the bathroom when you remember that you have to brush your teeth. You get the step stool that you use and reach for your toothbrush and toothpaste. You start brushing your teeth your mommy comes in. She looks in the potty and says &quot;You forgot to flush. When you're done brushing your teeth I want you to flush the toilet.<br />
<br />
You finish brushing your teeth and flush the potty. You're about to leave when you mommy cleared her throat. You had forgotten to wash your hands and your mommy just reminded you. You go back to the sink and wash your hands. After you put the step stool back and look at your mommy. She smiles and nods letting you know that you were done.<br />
<br />
You go back to your room and open the drawer that has your swimsuits in it. You're in a pink mood today so you pick out a pink one piece with a big red heart with a gold glitter outline on it. Next you go to your closet to pick out your dress. The one you pick is a pink short sleeve with ruffles on the hem and sleeves. You bend down and pick up a pair of pink sandals. You take everything and place them on your bed. You take off your nightgown and then your panties. You stop when you see your private part. For some reason you think that there should be something down there but you couldn't think of what that would be. You have this feeling that it shouldn't be as flat as it is. You wonder where these feelings are coming from. You decide to ignore them and finish getting ready. You put on your swimsuit, then your dress, and slip on your sandals. You pick up your nightgown and panties so you can throw them down the clothes chute.<br />
<br />
You go downstairs and see your daddy in the living room. He looks up and says &quot;Good morning princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Daddy&quot; you said. Then you decided to tell him about your dream. &quot;Daddy, I had a strange dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? What was it about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was like you Daddy. I was big and a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your daddy chuckles and says &quot;That is indeed a strange dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It seemed real.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your daddy chuckles again and says &quot;I know that some dreams may seem real but they're not. Sometimes they can seem so real that you don't know where you are when you wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what happened to me. I think that my voice sounds strange and there's suppose to be something in my private area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That must have been some dream. I'm going to tell you something that I haven't told anyone before. A couple years ago I had a dream where I was a little girl. It seemed so real to me that for the rest of the day I kept thinking that my voice had changed, that I shouldn't be so big, and that I should have a flat private area. There was even a few times that I caught myself almost going into the little girl's room. Eventually those feelings went away during the day and they will for you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you still remember that dream Daddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember it clearly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mommy came in at that point and said &quot;I have some news for you princess. Miley's going to be at the water park too.&quot;<br />
<br />
You jump up and down clapping your hands as you shout &quot;YEA! HANNA MONTANA IS GOING TO BE THERE!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Violet she's not going as Hanna Montana&quot; your mommy said. &quot;She's going there to relax and have fun, not to perform for anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we should get going&quot; your daddy said getting up. &quot;We'll stop and get some breakfast on the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
You head to the garage where the car was. You sit in your booster seat and your mommy buckles you in. You knew you needed the booster seat since you were only four foot one inch. You've been told that you would need the booster seat until you were about twelve. Normally you don't give it any thought but today you can't help but think that you shouldn't need it. Maybe these feelings would go away today like your daddy said his did. Your daddy starts the car and you're on your way to the water park.</p>
