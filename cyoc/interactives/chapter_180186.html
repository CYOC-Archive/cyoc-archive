<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryan felt like the plan was going well. Him and Wes had been closer with each other all through first and second period, talking, chatting, Bryan even found himself stroking Wes&#39; muscular arm at one point. He did it without thinking, as if their session yesterday had removed some block between them making it okay to do more than bro hugs and fist bumps. And some of the girls had taken noticed, watching the two of them closely as if the thought of the two muscular guys in a relationship was making them want them. It didn&#39;t seem to make sense, but Bryan had watched his fill of lesbian porn as well, so maybe it was just a thing with people.<br />
<br />
Third period was the first class Bryan and Wes had apart, and Bryan was hoping one of the girls would approach him now that it seemed like he might be going off the market. Both him and Wes were going to meet for lunch after class and see how it went.<br />
<br />
Bryan had study hall this period, so he was taking his time to get to class. Maybe a late entrance would pull some eyes to him. He stopped to drain the snake, then meandered down the hallways at the back of the school, taking the long route to the library.  He heard a sound coming from one of the classrooms ahead, but if he remembered right there were no classes up here at the moment. Curiously, he went up to the door and peeked inside. The sight gave him an instant erection.<br />
<br />
Ross leaned back against the teacher&#39;s desk his shirt pulled back over his head displaying his chest and abs, the dark brown skin almost glistening. Pressed up against him was his boyfriend Diego. On the baseball team, Diego was a bit leaner but with thick powerful arms, his skin naturally tanned. The two were furiously making out, Diego&#39;s naturally tanned back towards Bryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit..&quot; Bryan whispered under his breath, his hand going to adjust the stiff rod in his jeans, and then he started rubbing himself through the denim. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, he was looking right into Ross&#39; eyes. There was a moment of worry on Ross&#39; face and then he split into a grin. He beckoned Bryan in to the room. Bryan was about to take off, pretend he hadn&#39;t seen anything, but instead he slipped into the classroom and shut the door behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bryan, man! You been avoiding me?&quot; Ross was talking like he wasn&#39;t just leaning there having the make out session of his life, even if he was still running his fingers through Diego&#39;s hair. &quot;C&#39;mon, c&#39;mere. Diego, you don&#39;t mind do you?&quot; Diego made some sort of sound and shook his head, mouth buried against Ross&#39; neck.<br />
<br />
Bryan stepped in closer, looking over at Diego who had his shirt off, a light dusting of black hair along his pecs, even more shocking the front of his jeans were open, letting his brown cock hang free and hard, all seven thick inches of it. God, he was as hot as Ross. &quot;Looking good Bryan, I don&#39;t know how you and Wes do it not being on any of the teams, you should sign up... Speaking of.&quot; He reached out and grabbed Bryan by the shoulder, pulling him in close and wrapping him in a half hug. &quot;I&#39;ve seen you and Wes this last week. The way you look at each other, you two were practically about to make out in math class it looked like. Are you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No.. maybe.. no.. I mean we&#39;ve.. but..&quot; Why was Bryan suddenly so flustered. This was the first time he had been near Ross since he made his wish, hell, even before that, since their friendship had evaporated. He was shocked to see he was almost looking Ross right in the eyes. Ross was still bigger, about as big as Wes was now, but the difference was maybe down to 15 pounds at most between them. Here he was, almost the same size as Ross Jansen. He wanted to touch those deep brown pecs, he couldn&#39;t keep his eyes off them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve..?&quot; Ross prompted.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had sex,&quot; Bryan admitted, then quickly added, &quot;once.&quot; Ross&#39; hand was suddenly on his stiff dick, kneading it through his jeans. &quot;It&#39;s not like we&#39;re dating or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. Still testing the waters?&quot; Ross asked, with a laze smile that probably had to do with Diego teasing his nipples. &quot;Why&#39;d we stop hanging out again? Fuck, dude, you&#39;ve gotten hot. Let me see.&quot; Bryan lifted his shirt to show off his abs. &quot;No. All of it.&quot; So Bryan peeled off his shirt, setting it aside. Hairier than Diego he had a good bit of hair across his chest and stomach dark and curly, and he was a bit bigger than the baseball jock, except in the arms. Diego had some massive guns. He frowned down at his own chest though, seeing it near Diego&#39;s they were about the same shade. Had he tanned?<br />
<br />
The thought only lasted a moment, as Ross&#39; hand on his chest distracted him, calloused fingers teasing his nipples as the jock massaged his pecs. &quot;Fuck, Bryan.&quot; Then his hand went down to the erection pushing against Bryan&#39;s jeans. &quot;You&#39;re all pent up. We should take care of that for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.. uh.. no, you don&#39;t..&quot; But Diego&#39;s hands were working on his jeans already, the other guy chiming in. &quot;Hey, any friend of Ross&#39; is a friend of mine, and what a little blow job between friends?&quot; Diego pushed down on Bryan&#39;s pants and let them fall to the floor. Bryan had grown in size some more since yesterday, he could tell the moment his cock flopped free, like his chest it also looked a little darker, a light brown. But Diego turned to Ross and pushed his pants down as well, letting Ross&#39; dark girth escape it&#39;s confines. It was a bit thicker than Bryan&#39;s but they were almost the same length. Deigo smiled like it was Christmas. For the second time in as many days, Bryan felt his cock pressed up against another guys&#39;. The warm pulsing keeping both cocks stiff beating in time with each other.<br />
<br />
Ross&#39; lips pressed up against his own, their chests halfway pressed together as they turned their upper bodies towards each other. He felt a hand on his cock, keeping it pressed up against Ross&#39;, occasionally a tongue running along it, or a mouth surrounding his swollen head, or both heads at the same time. It was even hotter than his experiment with Wes yesterday.<br />
<br />
Wes. In his mind it wasn&#39;t Diego kneeling in front of him, double teaming his and Ross&#39; cocks but Wes. He wanted to see Wes kneeling down in front of him, sucking him off, looking up at him with big puppy dog eyes as he slurped away on Bryan&#39;s thick monster. Ross&#39; thick pillowy lips were warm against his, and he found himself pursing his lips to meet as much of them as he could as they made out.<br />
<br />
Bryan gasped as he came into Diego&#39;s waiting mouth, Ross&#39; cock pulsing against his. The jock was making a good effort at catching both streams, but some cum splatted in the stubble on his cheek. He wiped it off with a finger and lapped it up. Bryan looked down to see Diego&#39;s own cock was free and drooling cum onto the floor. But he never felt the hands leave the pair of his cock and Ross&#39;. Some trick.<br />
<br />
Ross bent over to pull up his pants, and then pulled his shirt down over his head, as Deigo cleaned himself up quickly and pulled his shirt back on. &quot;Next time bring Wes, we&#39;ll make a foursome of it.&quot; Ross said with a grin, giving Bryan one last kiss before throwing his arm around Diego and heading back out into the school hallway.<br />
<br />
Bryan leaned there for a moment, pants around his ankles, shirtless, and stunned. He had wanted to get with girls, not more guys. And yet.. that had been so fucking hot he wanted more. He quickly pulled up his pants and stuffed his cock back into his boxers, then grabbed his shirt and tugged it over his head. He quickly ran a hand through his hair which felt oddly curly as his fingers parted it.<br />
<br />
He quickly left the classroom, a new plan forming in his head.</p>
