<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The intense pleasure of the union was better than any orgasm, both sustained and intense. After they<br />
separated, Daryl and Adrienne unloaded the boxes in the meeting room next to the lab. Daryl arranged<br />
2 rows of chairs in the center of the room so that the chairs were back to back. Adrienne placed an egg under<br />
each of the chairs. What started out as seeds have grown into what appear to be watermelon sized eggs.<br />
The lights in the room were dimmed, so that the chairs in the center of the room were slightly visible in the<br />
darkness. <br />
<br />
The members of the small club came in wearing various latex clothing, from suits to a t-back bikini brief. There<br />
were nine members seated when a campus security officer came by. He was invited to take a seat with the other<br />
members, and he silently went to an open seat. Adrienne asked everyone to close their eyes, and the lights were<br />
dimmed into darkness. Daryl caressed each egg that was underneath a chair someone was sitting in, walking by<br />
each person one at a time. The room was silent as both Daryl and Adrienne sat on opposite ends of the group.<br />
A faint sound could be heard as the eggs opened slightly and long fibrous tendrils pushed out and down to the<br />
floor, and found the tendrils from their neighboring eggs. Once all the eggs were connected, and bonded to Daryl<br />
and Adrienne, the fibrous tendrils moved up. First, the tendrils covered the legs, then formed a firm hold that<br />
secured the people to their chairs.<br />
<br />
Daryl asked, &quot;If any one wishes to leave, please ask now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room was silent, and the tendrils moved upward. A few muffled screams and shouts were heard as the<br />
people were fully enclosed in the plant tendril roots. Daryl and Adrienne were also enclosed. The plant would<br />
evolve the volunteers, as both Daryl and Adrienne were modified into their final form. The couple, now completely<br />
bonded with the plant&#39;s DNA, were a single new sex like you. The others were also having their bodies remolded by the<br />
alien DNA.<br />
<br />
Everyone sitting in the chairs awoke at the same time. Their minds linked to each other. Each person was distinct, but<br />
the presence of the others and that of the alien library was in their thoughts. They were all aware of the changes that<br />
the DNA had done to their bodies. Their minds were awash in both new knowledge and the capability to understand and<br />
process it. No one moved, but no one was being held secure. The plant and eggs were spent, and starting to shutdown.<br />
The people in the chair began to tug at the dead tendrils after the link was broken. Daryl and Adrienne broke through<br />
their tendril cocoon to get up and stand. The room was dark, but everyone could see. Daryl and Adrienne walked back<br />
to the lab, their arms blending into each other as a mass of tiny thin tendrils.<br />
<br />
Each of the people sitting in the chairs were sitting alone in their thoughts, missing the blend and welcome of the neural link<br />
that once connected them. They each slowly stood, and shed the root system that once embraced them. They all left the room,<br />
saying nothing.<br />
<br />
The campus cop went to the security office, as his shift was about over. It had been over 3 hours since he left for his last round<br />
and joined the group. His uniform hung loose upon his new rubber frame. His large DD breasts pushed his shirt  out, his nipples clearly<br />
visible through is uniform shirt. He waited for his relief to arrive. The arrival of the morning shift made him smile. The two officers<br />
that came in were good friends. Both of the men were smiling, wondering what their friend was up to with this female guest wearing<br />
his uniform. He asked one of his friends to follow him into the office, while the other one waited. Once inside, the officer kissed his<br />
friend, sharing his nectar. The man began to disrobe, his mind flooded with a compulsion to masturbate. The rubber cop went outside<br />
to do the same to the other male officer. The rubber officer held his arms over each of his friend&#39;s penis&#39;s. Soon, his male friends would<br />
have a fertile womb and lactating DD breasts, while still looking male. They would need to interface with a seed egg to complete their<br />
transition. The rubber cop left, with both of his relief officers on the floor of the office. Their distended penis&#39;s were now large enough<br />
to allow their eggs to pass once they were ready. The changes to their chests were underway, with an uncomfortable puffiness around<br />
their nipples. The men would be a while before they could get up, their arousal compelling them to masturbate repeatedly to satisfy<br />
their urges and to fuel their body&#39;s changes.</p>
