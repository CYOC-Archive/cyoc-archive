<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob was, to put it simply, annoyed. Not pissed, because he was still having a good enough time, but annoyed. He&#39;d done some good work getting that little bitch Bryan to accept his place in the natural cock order. He already had some ideas on how to do it to a couple of his pals from the frat. It&#39;d be easy. But then Hugo had decided he was getting &quot;cocky&quot; or whatever (imagine that, a massive cock getting cocky, s&#39;pure irony!) and mailed him to some dude called Mint. <br />
<br />
Now, he&#39;d been put between the legs of a blue guy, actual blue guy, who had the nerves to let him hang around whilst doing whatever freakshow crap on his computers he wanted. He&#39;d learned a couple of things since then. First, that if Steve hadn&#39;t been giving him proof, Jacob would have confirmation he had no balls. As it stood, yeah, Steve apparently had balls and a dick, even if they were puny. Probably explained how he was such a little bitch. <br />
<br />
But really, he&#39;d always known that Hugo was a freak. But an alien? Ah! Something called a homan, blue-ish dudes that wanted to observe and probe humans. And turn men into their dicks. That part, Jacob agreed completely. He&#39;d never felt more like himself than when he was reduced to the most basic, most primal part of a man. None of that &quot;oh no, change me back, please&quot; shit with Jacob. He was a fuckstich and a fucking mammoth of a shower. So what if he couldn&#39;t be called human anymore? He was the best part of a human anyway. Those little pussies apparently never came in their dick forms if they complained about being dicks. Or maybe they were just too small to compare. <br />
<br />
Even William, the only dick Jacob might have respected for being almost as massive as himself, could only whine about his boyfriend. Pffft. Wait till Logan finds out and William would get plenty of fucking. Of the two, it was obviously Logan taking it up the ass. <br />
<br />
He felt himself twitch. His shaft swung left, like momentum, and it was hard to see much except the inside of Mint&#39;s blue thighs. For a second, his dickhead brushed against the plastic-like hot skin, rubbing him just enough to get a little friction going. Of course, that was when giant blue fingers came from the sky to pull him away and rearrange him. Now, Jacob was standing half-hard, aimed at nothing as Mint typed something on his holographic computers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, this shit is boring!&quot; Jacob protested, stirring and hardening. His body grew taller, pulling his view from the computer to Mint&#39;s chin and nose. &quot;Will you just beat me off already? Are you a guy or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
One hand moved, and smacked right into his side. Hard enough to make him swivel to the right, a bit painful at the base. But despite the second Jacob couldn&#39;t feel anything except the pain, he still noticed Mint&#39;s full-body wince. Moron couldn&#39;t take it even when he was the one dishing it. If Mint thought a little lovetap like that was enough to make him flinch, he was way too soft. Jacob had let him get away with it the first few times, curious to see if there was a real man under that blue exterior. But apparently, Mint figured a big cock like that could be tamed with some lovetaps. Dude had no clue, did he?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m down for some rough handling, Mint, but you gotta stop writing whatever stupid stuff that is and pay attention to your cock already!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hogo had warned me about you, but I didn&#39;t think you would be this arrogant, human.&quot; Mint rolled his eyes, crossing his arms and staring down at his white cock. &quot;You&#39;re nothing but a penis. Why do you keep acting as if you&#39;re in charge of anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob laughed. So easy. &quot;Real males think with their meat.&quot;<br />
<br />
He saw the glint of doubt in Mint&#39;s eyes at that. It was the truth. Every red-blooded guy knew it. That was the one thought on their mind, always. If your meat needed wetting, you better find some willing hole or hands somewhere. &quot;Only primates like you do,&quot; Mint scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. That&#39;s why you replaced your own cock with me. That&#39;s why you love showing me off to your freak friends. Face it, Mint. I&#39;m a far better cock than what you had before. That&#39;s why you love walking around naked. Bet you just love the contrast between white and blue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pleasure made him twitch and spit out a few drops of precum. Mint&#39;s gaze glazed over for a second. <br />
<br />
Jacob jolted, flexing his shaft as best as he could. &quot;Eh,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;you love that, don&#39;t you? The feeling of being bossed around by your own dick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know why Hogo didn&#39;t break you sooner,&quot; Mint sneered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right, right,&quot; Jacob drawled, his balls tight against the base of his shaft. &quot;Pull the other one. You think you can pretend that you don&#39;t love this when I&#39;m harder than steel? Or are you just saying I&#39;m the one deciding when to get hard?&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of a whack, both hands moved down from the sky, covering him in shadows, and gripped him.<br />
<br />
Finally, something interesting! <br />
<br />
Mint played rough, hard to get. Obviously, he couldn&#39;t admit defeat so easily. Good. A real male fought to the end, even against stronger opponents. Mint&#39;s thin fingers wrapped around Jacob like they wanted to squeeze the life out of him. The juices, at least. They ran up and down his lenght, pulling his foreskin roughly, hard enough to make the edges of skin slap his dickhead. Air briefly felt cold against his face, until he spat more pre and Mint pushed his foreskin back. He was pumping with both hands, fast, willing Jacob to shut up, but the order was cut through by the grunts and groan of them both. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that all you got?&quot; Jacob drawled between coughs of pre. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; Mint growled, one hand cupping his balls as he milked Jacob&#39;s head. &quot;You&#39;re my cock. You listen to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, f-fuck, you think? - More, c&#39;mon - then - oooh - why are you, fuck, jerking off?&quot; <br />
<br />
Mint&#39;s eyes widened as if he suddenly realized what had happened. Like he really was just the body attached to Jacob, not the other way around. It made his fingers more frantic, uncontrollable. It went flying past the tipping point. <br />
<br />
Hot liquid came rushing through his body, spewing in burst of pure ecstasy. Jacob&#39;s mind flashed white-hot, blank of anything but the fucking awesome orgasm that flooded his entire self. Fuck. He&#39;d never let anyone turn him back into a man if it meant losing this.<br />
<br />
His seed splashed over Mint&#39;s fingers, then dripped down all over his shaft. He was coated in cum, the only way a cock should ever be. <br />
<br />
Mint shuddered, then leaned back, melting into his seat. <br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; Jacob laughed. &quot;Much better than work. Aren&#39;t you glad you listened to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck off,&quot; Mint replied breathlessly. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I did that. You&#39;re my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob flexed a bit, refusing to go soft. Mint stiffened, wary. <br />
<br />
&quot;Correction. I&#39;m the Alpha Cock. You&#39;re just a lucky son of a bitch to get me. Still, you&#39;re Hugo&#39;s superior, huh? Means he&#39;ll obey your orders, right? &#39;Cause I had a couple of ideas.&quot;</p>
