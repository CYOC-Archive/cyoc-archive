<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Eric has been pounced on and hugged as he returned to the Camp with Dean, Greg had healed the Jaguar-Boy with the Chronivac-App, “there we go,” he had said, “good as new,” smiling. Eric had apologized to his friends for disappearing, they forgave him, but told him to never do such a thing again, at least not without informing them.<br />
<br />
Eric swore on his life that he&#39;ll let them know in the from now on, satisfied with this, they then decided to spend the rest of the day fishing and swimming in the lake.<br />
<br />
Now, after a long and stressful day, Eric, Tyler, Greg, Dean and Max are all sitting around the campfire. Max brought his guitar with him, which he is right now playing on, it is not easy with claws, but the Wolf-Hybrid is doing a good enough job. The group laugh and sing a few campfire songs, next they take turns to tell a scary story.<br />
<br />
Greg yawns, “man, what a day,” he says, “let&#39;s get to bed. This is our last night sleeping in these forms, tomorrow evening, we&#39;ll be back to normal.”<br />
<br />
Eric, not have told them, that he downloaded the App and set his change to be permanent, lowers his head. “Yeah... cool,” he says, sounding sad, “I... I don&#39;t want to be human again.”<br />
<br />
The others look at him, “really,” Greg asks, “you have been a Jaguar-Boy for not more than one and a half day. You really want to stay like that?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Eric says, “I... I feel so happy... happier than I was as a human, I love my tail, my fur, me new senses and even my animal instincts.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Greg says, “if you really want to stay like that...,” he trails off, Eric nods, understanding what Greg means.<br />
<br />
“I... I um... might have already... done that myself,” he admits.<br />
<br />
“WHAT,” the others shout.<br />
<br />
Eric nods, “y-yeah, last night I downloaded the App and set my change to be permanent and I also altered the reality, so that everyone, except you guys, think I have always been this way,” he looks at his friends. “Please... don&#39;t try to change my mind, because it won&#39;t,” he says, “I have a right to decide what I do with my body and life... no else has the right to tell me what I can or can&#39;t do.”<br />
<br />
The others look at each other, they then smile, “listen Eric,” Greg says, “of course you have the right to decide. If you are happy like this then, what the hell?”<br />
<br />
Eric smiles, “thanks for accepting it,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Also,” Max says, “who says that you are the only one who might not want to return to normal,” he winks and wags his tail.<br />
<br />
Greg smiles, “everyone has their right to decide what he wants,” he says, “I am not sure myself, we shall see.”<br />
<br />
“Same with this monkey,” Tyler says.<br />
<br />
“If I would decide to stay an Anthro... I might choose a different animal,” Dean says, “having a beak... is not so cool as I thought,” the others chuckle.<br />
<br />
“Anyway, let&#39;s get to bed,” Greg says, they all stand up, except Eric who stays sitting on his log, “what&#39;s up, Eric,” Greg asks.<br />
<br />
“Nothing,” he says, “I... I just would like to stay by the fire a little longer, I&#39;ll head to bed soon. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be here in the morning.”<br />
<br />
The others understand, Eric had a stressful day and they gave him a hard time for his disappearance, “okay, Eric,” Dean says, “we&#39;ll give you some space. And again, I am sorry for...,” he trails off.<br />
<br />
Eric gets up from his log and walks over to Dean, “it&#39;s all good, Dean,” he says, giving his friend a hug, “I&#39;ll see you in the morning,” he then walks back to his log and sits down.<br />
<br />
The others smile, “good night, Eric,” they say, as they walk to their tents.<br />
<br />
“Night guys,” Eric replies, looking and waving at them, Eric picks up a stick and starts poking at the fire, while staring into the dark jungle.<br />
<br />
Eric sits there for an hour, he then hears some rustling in the bushes in front of him, the Jaguar-Boy looks up and, thanks to his new vision, smiles when he spots a familiar tail sticking up over the bush. Eric takes a while and listens closely, making sure his friends are asleep, before standing up and silently walking towards the bush. He crouches down and, in a whisper and smile, says, “hey, Amory.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Eric,” Amroy whispers back, “as you can see, I kept my promise,” he says.<br />
<br />
“I never doubted that,” Eric whispers, “you want to come and sit by the fire with me?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d rather not,” Amory says, “I don&#39;t want to cause a panic, should one of your friends suddenly appear. I know a beautiful place, not far from here, for us to talk in private. I have so many questions, and would like to get to know you a little closer.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm...,” Eric says, he thinks about it, then he shrugs, “sure, as long as I am back here in the morning. I really don&#39;t want to anger my friends... again.”<br />
<br />
Amory nods, “then follow me, cub,” he says.<br />
<br />
“He-hey... I am not THAT young,” Eric says, pouting as he stands up and walks behind the bush.<br />
<br />
Amory is grinning, “hehe... you are a cub and young to me,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Okay... fine,” Eric says, “you can call me “cub” if you want to.”<br />
<br />
Amory smiles, “then follow me, cub,” he says.<br />
<br />
Eric follows the big cat, as he leads the former human deeper into the jungle. After a few minutes, they reach a clearing with a lake, Eric&#39;s eyes widen, he looks around. The moon is shining down, the sky is littered with stars and fireflies are flying all over the place. “Whoa... this place is beautiful,” he says in amazement.<br />
<br />
“It sure is,” Amory says, leading Eric down to the water, “I come here a lot, just to relax and think about things. It is pretty lonely, I wish I had someone to share it with,” he looks up at Eric, smiling, “and now I have you.”<br />
<br />
Eric blushes a little under his fur, he feels weird once again, but shrugs it off, “s-so,” he says, as they sit down by the water, “wh-what questions do you have? What would you like to know?”<br />
<br />
“Let&#39;s start with: why, of all animals, have you chosen to become a Jaguar,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Eric shrugs, “I always liked big cats,” he says, “I always found them majestic, strong and powerful creatures. When I was younger, I always dreamed of wanting to be a cub, I even had dreams of being a big cat. I dunno, I always felt a strange connection towards... your kind.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Amory says, he then looks over at Eric, “this might sound weird, but... I think you are one beautiful Jaguar.”<br />
<br />
Hearing this, Eric gets a weird feeling in his stomach, like butterflies, “th-thanks, Amory,” he says, “th-that is nice of you to say. I think... you are a beautiful Jaguar yourself... you look so majestic.”<br />
<br />
Amory purrs, “why, thank you,” he says, “tell me, what is it like being human?”<br />
<br />
Eric shrugs, “it&#39;s... nothing special really,” he says, “we humans... well... I&#39;m not a human right now.... .”<br />
<br />
“Hehe, I know how you mean it, Eric,” Amory says.<br />
<br />
“R-right...,” Eric stutters, “anyway... humans have to wear clothes.”<br />
<br />
Amory tilts his head, “what is that?”<br />
<br />
Eric scratches his head, “um... clothes are made of fabric. We have to cover our bodies with clothes, or else we would be naked.”<br />
<br />
“Is that a bad thing?”<br />
<br />
Eric nods, “yes,” he says, “humans find it... unaesthetic. And without clothes we freeze.”<br />
<br />
“Aah, I think I understand,” Amory says, “so, “clothes” for humans would be like “fur” for us animals?”<br />
<br />
Eric nods, “yes,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Do you like wearing clothes?”<br />
<br />
“Not really,” Eric says, “I have always been against clothes, I kinda felt as if I were being restricted, when ever I got the chance to be naked, I took it, because I kinda felt... free.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Amory says, “so... I guess you feel free in your new Jaguar form?”<br />
<br />
Eric nods and smiles, “I love this new body of mine,” he says, “my hearing, my sense of smell, my ability to climb, my claws, my tail, my FUR... I love everything about it!”<br />
<br />
Amory chuckles, “hehe, you are just to cute,” he says, letting out a laugh when he notices Eric look flustered.<br />
<br />
“I g-guess I am kinda cute looking,” Eric says, rubbing the back of his head.<br />
<br />
Amory grins, &#39;I really enjoy teasing the cub,&#39; he thinks to himself, he moves a little closer to Eric, so that their bodies almost touch. “Tell me more about humans,” he says, “I am so curious.”<br />
<br />
Eric feels a little off with the big, majestic and powerful cat being this close to him, he feels so small and weak in Amory&#39;s presence, “we-well... um..,” he starts, “humans have to work, go to school, and always have issues, problems and stress.”<br />
<br />
“Hm...,” Amory says, “sounds like, being a human isn&#39;t that fun.”<br />
<br />
Eric nods, “you animals have it so much easier,” he says, “no worries, no duties... just sleep all day and occasionally hunt for food. Your lives are so relaxed and stress free.”<br />
<br />
Amory snorts, “pff... believe me,” he says, “we animals have pretty stressful lives... especially when it comes down to... mating.”<br />
<br />
Eric looks at Amory, “really,” he asks, “I thought it easy... you know: sniff out a female, jump on her back, mate, have babies and live happily ever after!”<br />
<br />
Amory bursts out laughing, “s-sorry,” he says, “but no, I wish it were that easy. It isn&#39;t, some females have already been mated with, others don&#39;t want to mate or there aren&#39;t any females around, like in my case.”<br />
<br />
“Wh-what do you mean,” Eric asks.<br />
<br />
Amory looks at Eric, “I never had a mate,” he then says, “the Amazon is so huge, it is so difficult to find other Jaguars. Every time I think I found my female, I discover that she has already been claimed. I am, by the way, 10-years-old, which in human years would be around 60 or 70... maybe even older?”<br />
<br />
“H-how old so Jaguars get?”<br />
<br />
“We get around 12 to 15 years old,” Amory says, “so... yeah..., I&#39;m an old... man... hehe.... .”<br />
<br />
“Oh...,” Eric says, sounding sad.<br />
<br />
“Why do you sound so sad,” Amory asks.<br />
<br />
“I... I dunno,” Eric says, “I know we have just met... b-but I kinda like you a lot... I&#39;d hate to lose you.”<br />
<br />
Amory tilts his head, “Eric, it&#39;s okay,” he says, “I like you too, but... you will head home to your family soon... who knows if we every see each other again.”<br />
<br />
Tears form in Eric&#39;s eyes, he sniffles, “I... I really would rather stay here... with you.”<br />
<br />
“What about your friends and family,” Amory asks.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t care,” Eric says, “I... I wanna stay here... for ever! This jungle... feels... much more like home than a big city!”<br />
<br />
Amory thinks for a while, “no, Eric,” he says, “YOU belong with the humans, you have your own life, friends and family. Do NOT through that away just because of me.”<br />
<br />
Eric sighs, “I... I guess you are right,” he says, “still... I&#39;d hate if this would be the last time we&#39;ll see each other.”<br />
<br />
Amory leans his head against Eric and rubs his head against the Jaguar-Boy&#39;s shoulder, he purrs softly, “then, let&#39;s make this night unforgettable for us both,” he says.<br />
<br />
Eric smiles, he leans his own head against his new friend&#39;s head and rubs back, starting to purr himself, “yeah... lets,” he says.<br />
<br />
After a while of just sitting in silence, rubbing against each other and purring, Amory lies down beside Eric, “so, when will you change back into a human?”<br />
<br />
“I won&#39;t,” Eric says, when Amory looks up at him with a confused look Eric continues, “you remember the Chronivac, which made you smarter and able to talk?”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” Amory says.<br />
<br />
“Well... I used it on me and made this body...,” Eric moves a hand up and down his Jaguar body, “...permanent! I&#39;ll be like this until I die!”<br />
<br />
Amory&#39;s eyes widen, “really? What will your fellow humans say?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, don&#39;t worry,” Eric says, “I altered the reality, everyone, except my friends who are here with me, will think I have always been this way. So I don&#39;t need to worry about potential danger.”<br />
<br />
Amory smiles, “well, I assume this makes you happy: being able to run around naked and free!”<br />
<br />
Eric chuckles, “yep,” he says, “I wish I could take you with me, buuuut... a grown Jaguar in a big city would not be a good idea.”<br />
<br />
Amory nods, “yeah... I am happy in my jungle,” he says, he looks at Eric, “and since you know where I am, you can come visit me from time to time.”<br />
<br />
“Believe me, Amory,” Eric says, “I WILL!”<br />
<br />
Amory chuckles, he then says, “I was thinking: I&#39;d like you to use the App on me once again.”<br />
<br />
“Hu, wh-why,” Eric asks, “I mean... sure, if you want me to. But what do you want to change?”<br />
<br />
“Well... I was looking at your paws... hands,” Amory says, “I find they look cool and pretty useful, these paws... they are kinda annoying... I can&#39;t really grab and hold something, without using my claws.”<br />
<br />
“You want hands?”<br />
<br />
Amory nods, “yeah, and you said the App can even make someone younger,” he says.<br />
<br />
Eric nods, “yeah, you want to be younger?”<br />
<br />
Amory nods, “yeah, or at least not have to live “cat-years”... I&#39;d like to live the same way as you, that way we could see each other many many times. Also... I kinda would like to have a body... like you!”<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s eyes widen, “why do you want a body like me?”<br />
<br />
“Because, I find it interesting,” Amory says.<br />
<br />
“But... won&#39;t that making hunting more difficult,” Eric asks, “I mean... wouldn&#39;t your prey see you coming?”<br />
<br />
Amory grins, “nah, I&#39;ll still have my digitigrade legs, so I would still be able to crouch down and sneak up on my prey.”<br />
<br />
Eric thinks for a while, “actually... I like the sound of that,” he says, “but I don&#39;t have my phone with me... it&#39;s back at the camp in my tent.”<br />
<br />
Amory smiles, “the night is still young,” he purrs, “why don&#39;t you hurry and get it?”<br />
<br />
Eric nods, “I&#39;ll be right back,” he says, he then stands up and hurries back to the camp, not noticing Amory grinning.<br />
<br />
&#39;Eric will most certainly NOT forget this night,&#39; he thinks to himself, licking his lips, &#39;hehe... I know I won&#39;t!&#39;</p>
