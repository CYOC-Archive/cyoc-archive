<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Martha got the call about the elementary school being closed due to consequences of the storm, her husband William was in the shower.<br />
When he came out, Martha tried to talk her fellow Skulk into playing hooky, but was disappointed when he passed. Martha explained her situation to him while William got dressed, but all her handsome werefox could promise was he&#39;d call before he was on his way home for the day.<br />
Now alone in their bed, Martha considered going solo (as she called it) but then reconsidered.<br />
She didn&#39;t want the snooty werepanthress Amanda Knight to smell anything untoward on her at their meeting. Besides, Martha knew she could always call one of her bi or lesbian friends for some fun between scouting the opposition (not knowing about recent developments that now protected the Andersons and Lawsons) and William&#39;s return.<br />
With that, Martha stretched and prepared to have a long bubble bath before her meeting with Amanda Knight.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Alyssa Cooper was still in bed at her motel room, which wasn&#39;t a surprise considering that she was on vacation.<br />
The fact that her friend Betty stayed for some &quot;private action&quot; after Brian Walker left to go home for the night was.<br />
The were-mermaid and the werecat were enjoying the juices flowing from each other&#39;s very moist cunts for a late breakfast when Alyssa&#39;s cellphone began ringing. She was going to totally ignore it and let the call go to voicemail when she realized her phone was playing the theme from <i>Dragnet</i>, the ringtone she set aside for her cousin the Sheriff of Moon Lake.<br />
Telling Betty she had to be quiet while she took this call, Alyssa answered and soon got an earful about the anonymous e-mail that the Sheriff&#39;s department had received concerning her and Brian Walker.<br />
&quot;After all, you&#39;re the only one I know who fits the e-mail&#39;s description. Now, despite the fact he&#39;s only 14, since Brian Walker is an active were, you haven&#39;t broken any laws; depending upon what the two of you actually did around the school,&quot; explained Sheriff Cooper, even as he reached for a new bottle of aspirin. &quot;I&#39;ve already had to talk to Mrs. Walker, promising to look into this situation personally, but I&#39;m totally surprised I haven&#39;t heard from anyone at the school about this yet.&quot;<br />
&quot;All I&#39;ve done is pick the kid up from school for the last 3 days. We went to the lake for the first two, but because of the bad weather, we stayed in my motel room last night until he had to go home,&quot; said Alyssa, taking the situation VERY seriously.<br />
&quot;You never talked to anyone other than Brian, nor introduced yourself to anyone he knew?&quot; asked her cousin.<br />
&quot;No. The pickups were prearranged. He came straight to my car, hopped in, and we drove off. Nothing else.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmmm....&quot; Her cousin knew Alyssa was horny enough to fuck anything male or female if she could, but despite her recent bad encounter with the Stovalls, she was at least always honest with him. But thinking about the recent troubles with that family gave him an idea. &quot;How did the two of you meet to begin with?&quot;<br />
&quot;Since the hotel pool has to use chemicals to meet health regs, I went to the lake Monday night for a freshwater dip. Not that I was expecting to see her at the time, but Julie Stovall and him were already going at it hot and heavy when I swam by. She remembered seeing me at her house and invited me to join them for a threesome. We didn&#39;t get very far when Julie had to take off to avoid being found by her parents, who were steaming mad at her for sneaking out against their wishes again,&quot; explained Alyssa.<br />
&quot;And your encounter with Martin and Melissa Stovall?&quot; asked the sheriff.<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, uneventful,&quot; said his disappointed cousin. &quot;They were more interested in finding Julie, and just as shocked to find me there as I was to see Julie. But since she took advantage of our conversation to split undetected, her folks never made any connection between her and me. All I&#39;ve heard about her since is what Brian&#39;s told me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. Officially, I still have to investigate this allegation, and I&#39;m going to do that by paying an unexpected visit to the Stovalls with a warrant to search Julie&#39;s computer first. In the meantime, although it sounds like you&#39;re in the clear legally on this matter, you might want to take some time away from Moon Lake for a couple of days to avoid the heat,&quot; suggested her cousin. &quot;When do you have to be back in California?&quot;<br />
&quot;A week from Monday,&quot; answered Alyssa.<br />
&quot;Do you have anywhere closer, not in Moon Lake, that you can stay for a couple of days?&quot;<br />
Alyssa was about to answer &#39;no&#39; when she felt Betty tapping a paw on her shoulder. The were-mermaid turned and saw a feline head shaking affirmatively, because her acute hearing had listened in on both sides of the conversation.<br />
&quot;I have some friends in Seattle I was thinking about visiting,&quot; was Alyssa&#39;s answer.<br />
&quot;Okay. Check out, go to Seattle, and stay there for a couple of days. I&#39;ll call in case anything new develops that I need information from you on. Otherwise, call me Monday.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is everything going to be okay?&quot;<br />
&quot;For you? Probably, unless someone in or around the school contradicts your statement. For Brian, probably not, at least in regards to his mother. She was still very upset when we finished talking, but at least she&#39;s willing to wait till he gets home from school for the day to confront Brian so they can avoid a public scene. For Julie Stovall? Depends upon what I discover on her computer. In any event, stay out of Moon Lake for the weekend. Stay by your phone and call me Monday unless I need to call you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. And Douglas?&quot; said Alyssa, using his first name. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, we&#39;re about the only family each other has. I&#39;ll watch out for you the best I can, but I can&#39;t go against the law either,&quot; he tells her.<br />
&quot;I understand, but thank you.&quot;<br />
Then they end their phone conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what now?&quot; asks Betty, holding Alyssa close. The were-mermaid loved the sensation of fur against her bare skin, but there was too much going on right now to indulge in that.<br />
&quot;I do what my cousin suggested and get out of town for a few days until the heat dies down. Nobody saw you come in here last night, did they?&quot;<br />
&quot;Remember who you&#39;re talking to,&quot; said the werecat.<br />
&quot;Then you&#39;re in the clear. The tip off was only about me and Brian.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. So you blow this hick town for a while. There&#39;s plenty of hot were action in Seattle if you know where to look,&quot; said Betty, anticipating a fun weekend ahead with Alyssa.<br />
&quot;Yeah, but if you want to continue seeing a certain were-otter like I plan to whenever you&#39;re in the area and he&#39;s available, you&#39;ll have to keep quiet a couple of more minutes while I make another phone call. Then we&#39;ll get out of here and have some fun,&quot; promised Alyssa, even as she sped dialed Brian&#39;s cellphone.<br />
Then, after she finished leaving a message and hung up her phone, Alyssa turned to Betty and said, &quot;Considering what you arrived here in last night, I&#39;ve got some clothes that will fit you so you can sneak away while I pack and check out. There&#39;s this little gas station a few miles outside of town where we&#39;ll hook back up and go on to Seattle together for the weekend, but there&#39;s one thing I&#39;d like to ask you right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; said Betty, even as she started shifting out of her fursona to reveal the sexy older woman she was.<br />
&quot;When the two of us can come back to Moon Lake next week, how do you feel about sushi?&quot; asked Alyssa, thinking about what she would do to a certain mermaid if she got the chance.<br />
<br />
AT MOON LAKE HIGH SCHOOL...<br />
Brian Walker&#39;s first period class was just about to end for the day when he felt his cellphone vibrate. But instead of indicating it was a text message, Brian was surprised to see it was a voice mail.<br />
As he got up to leave for his second period class, he played the message, but stopped in his tracks hearing Alyssa Cooper&#39;s warning.<br />
&quot;Just listen and don&#39;t try to call me back. Somehow Julie Stovall found out about the two of us and <i>anonymously</i> spilled the beans to both my cousin the Sheriff AND your mother. Whether or not you get any flak from the school remains to be seen, because apparently Julie hasn&#39;t contacted them about us yet. Guess she thinks she&#39;s gotten enough revenge for the moment. Anyway, my cousin says since we&#39;re both weres we didn&#39;t break any laws, but that might not keep you from getting into hot water with your mom, and for that I&#39;m sorry. You&#39;re a nice kid and a great fuck, and I&#39;d love to see you again. Thankfully no one knows about you, me, and Betty; let alone our plans for your future except the three of us, so keep ABSOLUTELY quiet about that! I&#39;ll be back in Moon Lake sometime next week before I have to return to California to help you make the final arrangements to start your new career. Meanwhile, take care and good luck Brian.&quot;</p>
