<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about a pack of Avengers undies, Nick, I think you&#39;d look super cute in them!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? These dinosaur briefs would suit him much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick couldn&#39;t help but feel a touch awkward as Wes and Clark good-naturedly debated the kind of underoos he&#39;d be spending the weekend in. Though he knew he set himself up for this by agreeing to be five for the next couple of days, Nick couldn&#39;t have imagined that his neighbor and boyfriend would be arguing in the middle of a big-box store over which tiny childish undies would be most adorable on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t we have any shopping to do for Clark?&quot; Nick lamely interjected, hoping to spread the embarrassment around a bit. &quot;All we&#39;ve done so far is buy stuff for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need - after all, your little stinker of a boyfriend is going right back to diapers.&quot; Wes playfully punched Clark&#39;s shoulder as the man grinned bashfully. &quot;So for him we can just use the supplies I bought during the last spree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome to join me in Pampers if you want,&quot; Clark offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks - this time I&#39;d at least like to be old enough to go potty by myself.&quot; Nick needled Clark as his boyfriend stuck his tongue out at him. He turned his attention to the display of boys&#39; briefs, studying it for a moment before plucking a pack from the shelf. &quot;How about these?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh - Pikachu, huh?&quot; Nick and Clark looked at Wes in surprise as he immediately identified the iconic electric mouse. &quot;What? Did you forget that I have little nephews? Pokémon is basically all they talk about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was just like your nephews twenty-some-odd years ago.&quot; Nick chuckled. &quot;I was five when the first game came out and it became my whole life. There&#39;s a picture somewhere in my parents&#39; album of me wearing a pair just like these - I was so proud of them that I was more than happy to pose in nothing but my bright yellow briefs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can be sure that I&#39;ll be taking a picture or two this time around, too.&quot; Wes teased as a blushing Nick tossed them in the cart. &quot;That&#39;s it for clothes - you guys wanna hit up the toy aisle before we head home?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Nick and Clark exclaimed in childish excitement despite still (for the moment) being fully grown. The trio shared a laugh as they headed to the most fun part of the store, all three eager for the weekend to properly get started.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys ready?&quot; Wes raised an eyebrow as Nick and Clark nodded with differing degrees of determination. &quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t wanna take your clothes off for this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I mean...&quot; Nick fumbled with his words. &quot;Half the fun of getting little is shrinking out of them, so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay. I won&#39;t push if that&#39;s what you like.&quot; Wes winked at the pair as he levelled the gun at them. &quot;Who&#39;s first?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clark confidently raised his hand. Wes pulled the trigger the instant he did so, and though this wasn&#39;t the first time he and Nick had witnessed the incredible transformation that unfolded before them, both nevertheless looked on in utter fascination as Clark&#39;s adult development was undone before their eyes. In a matter of moments his masculine, well-defined frame dwindled to the scrawny slouch of his gawky teenage years. Another few seconds was all it took for the total reversal of his adolescence, Clark&#39;s pants losing their grip on his slimming waist and slithering their way down his skinny legs. Far from making any effort at keeping them up, Clark merely giggled as he stepped out of his too-big trousers to grin up at Wes and Nick in nothing but his oversized shirt, which was already at his knees and dangling lower with each passing instant. Soon Clark was so young that a little wriggle was all it took for his slender shoulders to slip through the collar, the two-year-old blushing from head to toe but looking utterly delighted otherwise as he stood naked before his boyfriend and his part-time daddy.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s my baby bear!&quot; Clark squealed and laughed his little head off as Wes took him by the armpits and whisked him off his bite-sized toes, spinning the toddler around in the air for a moment before pulling him into a big hug and kissing his glowing, baby-smooth cheek. Clark hugged back with all the strength his pudgy arms could muster, looking up at Wes in obvious adoration as the man balanced the baby on his hip and, with his free hand, aimed the gun at Nick. &quot;What say we make you a little playmate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick shivered as the energy emanating from his invention poured into him, surrendering himself to the excitement that coursed through his veins and grew gradually more intense as he started shrinking. Though he was confident in the improvements he&#39;d made to the device, Nick couldn&#39;t shake the gnawing thought that he and Clark were again risking a permanent return to childhood just so they could have a fun weekend with Wes. But as he regressed those worries were pushed out by the giddy feelings bubbling up inside of him, gradually regaining his carefree childhood demeanor as he descended deeper and deeper into his youth. Nick stepped out of his pants much as Clark had but stopped shrinking before he could slip through the shirt that dangled off his bony shoulder, the sail-like garment billowing over him until the newly-minted five-year-old clumsily pulled it off to stand nude before Wes and Clark, both of whom beamed down at the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there&#39;s the little genius.&quot; Wes leaned down to set Clark on his itty-bitty feet and ruffle Nick&#39;s curly head of hair. The two-year-old immediately toddled over to his shrunken boyfriend, marveling for a moment at how Nick could be so young and yet still stand head and shoulders above his current infantile stature. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nick!&quot; He piped right before wrapping his tiny arms around the bigger boy. &quot;Your tho cute!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wook who&#39;s tawking, widdle fewwa.&quot; Nick cooed as he returned the hug, loving the feeling of holding his warm, soft, impossibly adorable toddler of a boyfriend in his embrace.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys are so sweet you&#39;re gonna give me diabetes.&quot; Wes rolled his eyes as he opened the pack of briefs, plucked out a pair and held them open in front of Nick. &quot;Let&#39;s get you into your super-cool undies before we diaper your baby boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I can...&quot; Nicks swayed uncertainly for a moment as he studied the electric-yellow trim of the bright white briefs, of the tiny smiling Pikachus which filled the otherwise-viriginal cotton canvas. &quot;...I can dwess mythelf...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you can, sweetie, but isn&#39;t this weekend all about letting daddy take care of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick frowned and pondered this for a moment before sighing and stepping carefully into the utterly childish undies. Wes pulled the pair up his legs, snapped the elastic waistband to fit and then attacked Nick&#39;s bare smooth sides with fast fingers. The boy howled and squealed in mock indignation as Wes tickled him mercilessly, Nick&#39;s last bit of self-consciousness fading away beneath a stream of endless giggles. Wes eventually showed mercy, leaving Nick to catch his breath so that he could grab the supplies necessary to diaper Clark. Now all too familiar with the process, Clark laid himself out on the carpet without even being asked, smiling up silently at Wes as the crinkly undies were slipped beneath his plump little tushie. He whimpered and closed his eyes as Wes&#39; big strong hands powdered and passed over his most private and sensitive of areas, whining and wriggling against the carpet as the man casually teased the tiny stiffie Clark had sprung. Wes looked over to Nick as he did this, grinning at how entranced the five-year-old seemed to be by watching the man diaper his toddlerized boyfriend. Nick was so caught up in the display, in fact, that he seemed unaware both of Wes looking at him and of the way his own weewee strained against the Y-front of his Pikachu briefs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now that you guys are decent...&quot; Wes declared as he taped Clark into his Pampers and stood him next to Nick. &quot;We&#39;ve got the whole rest of the day to do whatever you want. What&#39;s first on the agenda?&quot;</p>
