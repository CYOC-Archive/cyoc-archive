<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dean grinned as Jeff programmed his own life away. He would edit what was needed as soon as he could. Jeff wouldn´t have a say in it then anymore.<br />
“Everything like you want it for the week, Dean? Or anything else?” Jeff asked when he finished typing his changes.<br />
“Let me see if anything needs to be added.” Dean answered, and switched positions with Jeff at the computer. A minute later, Dean nodded. “Okay, nothing to add. Do I only need to confirm your settings, Jeff?”<br />
“I want to do so myself, but yes. Its the last decision I make for a week after all.” Jeff answered.<br />
“Don´t be so sure about that, Jeff” Dean thought grinning. Just as he started to get up to switch back with Jeff in front of the computer, the doorbell rung downstairs.<br />
“Oh, I forgot. I also asked Michael over before the program arrived here. I will let him in, don´t start my changes before we are back, Dean.” Jeff said while leaving the room.<br />
Dean couldn´t believe his luck, Jeff had left him alone, making editing his profile easy. So, he quickly made a few edits. Jeff hadn´t made himself an eight-week-old puppy like Dean wanted, but half-a-year instead, which was fixed first. Next, Dean made sure Jeff would have a full puppy mind, overwriting his human one. But with a grin, he made also sure Jeff would be aware in the puppies body, just without any control. A bit more obedient to himself than Jeff had programmed before, and finally, raising the duration from a week to a year. If he was bored of the puppy, he could let Jeff change back and then make another change. If not, he could still make it longer or even permanent.<br />
Hearing Jeff and Micha talk while something clinked downstairs in the kitchen, Dean grinned at another idea. Quickly scanning Micha´s profile as well, Dean copied over Jeff´s changes, planning to get two puppies instead of only one. To add another laugh, Dean made sure that the puppies would be brothers and, grinning evilly at the idea, love to try humping each other. As neither Jeff nor Micha were gay, it would be horror to them both. He only changed Micha´s breed from the copied golden retriever to a German Shepard. <br />
Dean switched back to Jeff´s profile and stood up, instead sitting down on Jeff´s bed, just as Jeff and Micha enter the room, carrying something to drink and glasses for each of them. “Hi Micha.” Dean greeted.<br />
Micha grinned at Dean: “Hey Dean. Jeff said he would be your puppy for a week. I would like to see him change as well. Maybe I can take him walkies sometime the week as well. Hope you don´t mind me asking.”<br />
Dean laughed. “We will see. We can walk him after the change together if you want.” “Only not in the way you think” he added in his thoughts.<br />
“Sure” Micha answered happily.<br />
“Then let´s start my changes so you get your puppy, Dean.” Jeff said and confirmed all programmed changes without checking them for edits made by Dean. He then raised his glass of soda. “For a week of vacation from humanity.”<br />
The changes would only start a minute after confirming them, and than Dean could somewhat steer the direction they would take. It would take a maximum of ten minutes, down from the hour Jeff had set before, as Dean didn´t want to wait this long for his puppies to finish.<br />
As Dean looked at Jeff, he saw his ears turned fluffy and his hair lightening into a blond color. A quick glance over to Micha showed his black hair also got slightly lighter, becoming more dark brown, and his ears growing. They also had slowly begun to shrink slowly, but around the same size to each other. Grinning evilly, he raised his voice into a commanding tone to them: “Strip! I don´t want to clean up the shreds, puppies.”<br />
Both Jeff and Micha jerked, as to their changed ears Dean was nearly screaming at them. Both turned towards him, while also starting to follow that command, taking their shirts off first. “You don´t need to shout, Dean” Jeff said. “And do I really need to strip?” He didn´t think about the fact that he was already stripping. His jeans dropped down, and he stepped out of them. Micha did the same without noticing.<br />
Dean grinned still. “As puppies don´t wear clothes, you won´t need them anymore. So strip completely naked!” Only the last sentence was again said with the same commanding voice as before.<br />
Jeff turned red, embarrassed as he stripped out of his socks, and then slowly removed his boxers. Micha did the same standing next to him, his shoes had been left downstairs already. Just then, he realized he had stripped as well as Jeff, turning tomato red within two seconds.<br />
Micha yelped, asking in a high pitched voice: “Why have I stripped? You just meant Jeff, right? I´m not turning into a pup as well, right?”<br />
Jeff spun around, looking at Micha in shock. Dean grinned at Micha. “You stripped as I commanded, and I meant you both. When Jeff let you in, I added you in the changes as my second puppy, Micha. Only that you won´t be a golden retriever pup like your brother Jeff will be, but a German Shepard pup instead.”<br />
“You edited Micha in? Did you change more for me as well? Jeff asked, panic raising. He jumped up and towards the computer, trying to stop the changes or at least see what Dean had changed.<br />
“Stay down, boys!” Dean commanded when Micha also turned towards the computer. Both reacted instantly with dropping forward onto all fours, before they felt like being frozen in place.<br />
“What have you done? Why can´t I move?” Jeff screamed, now in a full blown panic, his voice sounding like a ten-year-old. Was he forced to do anything Dean said?<br />
Dean laughed at them, just watching them for a moment. Both were by now around half their old size and still shrinking. Their anatomy hadn´t changed much until they followed his command and got down on all fours. Now their naked, but already mostly fur-covered bodies slowly cracked into shape. He wasn´t a monster, so he had made sure it would be painless, but most likely still uncomfortable. One loud crack bend their backs, making them stay down, while smaller ones fitted their still fur-less arms and legs to a quadruped stance. Their legs had shortened more then their arms as they shrunk, so they didn´t have to raise their asses up into the air.<br />
“Don´t worry Jeff, I haven´t done much. I reduced your age to the point I originally wanted, eight weeks, not you half year setting. I made the changes happen faster, as I didn´t want to wait an hour for you to finish. And I raised your obedience while you change, so I could be save you wouldn´t do anything stupid, not that the changes are stoppable once started. Once you are my puppies, that obedience will be back to normal. But I should try to train you already, maybe it carries over to your new minds. Face me and sit!” Dean explained, hiding the extended duration for now.<br />
Both Jeff and Micha pressed their asses down into the carpet, assuming a sitting position like a dog would, as soon as they turned around to look at Dean. Grinning, he praised them: “Good boys! You are learning already. Raise your right paw!”<br />
As Dean knelt before them, both Jeff and Micha raised their still unchanged, right hand to him. While still in panic, Jeff felt happy to be good to his owner. A sudden fear of disobedience filled him. Micha, while feeling similar to Jeff, wasn´t as panicked as his friend, only shocked instead. The idea of Jeff as a puppy had been cool, but he didn´t want to be one as well. “I don´t want to be a puppy, Dean. Couldn´t you at least ask me before?”<br />
Dean took Jeff´s right hand first, and while petting it, it changed between his hands. Jeff´s fingers shrunk away, his nails turned into dark claws, his thumb wandering back while becoming a dew-claw. Paw-pads formed on his palm, and fur begun to sprout around the paw and up his right arm, now more of a fore-leg.<br />
Satisfied, Dean repeated the same process with Micha´s right hand while answering: “I could have, but it was an impulse when I had enough time to add you. And I hadn´t wanted Jeff to look at his profile, so I couldn´t really ask you before he started. Now, left paw!”<br />
As both Micha and Jeff raised their left hand, following after putting their new right fore-paw down, Dean repeated the petting process until both had two fore-paws. Without them noticing it, their feet had changed alongside their hands, leaving them with four paws now. That left only their faces unchanged, and their tails hadn´t grown in. “But its still only a week, right?” Jeff asked frightened.<br />
Dean now petted their heads, Jeff with his left hand and Micha with his right, grinning evilly. “Good boys! Ah, yeah, I forgot to mention it, Jeff. I extended the time a bit. A week seemed so short to train two puppies. Don´t worry, I will care for you both. Beg!”<br />
Again, Jeff´s eyes widened in fear, and Micha´s did as well, as they sat back, begging. “How …. How long?” Micha asked quietly.<br />
Dean praised them again for their begging, willing their tails to grow under them. “I would rather let that be a surprise. Don´t worry, you will probably change back. Now lay down and roll over!”<br />
Now Jeff really feared the answer as he laid down and rolled onto his back, laying alongside Micha now. “Please, Dean, how long?”<br />
Dean rubbed their bellies while watching their growing tails, as well as their new sheaths around their now nearly none-existent red cocks. They were nearly finished changing, as their bodies stopped shrinking, leaving them in their final puppy size, no bigger than a cat would be. “Okay, I will tell you, little pups. I have put in a year instead.” Dean grinned at their horrified faces.<br />
Both shouted at the same time: “A whole year? Are you mad? ...” They were horrified by that, but before they could shout more, Dean stopped them by putting a hand to each face, hitting their noses lightly.<br />
“Bad boys, silence! You know, I could have made it permanent, right? Maybe I will do so later, if I like my puppies more than you two as humans.” Then he grinned at them again. “I will need new names for you, neither Jeff nor Micha are fitting names for dogs.”<br />
Neither Jeff nor Micha could protest, because as much as they wanted to shout and scream, Dean´s “Silence” command had them shut up. They could only move their mouths, no sound was heard. Added to that was a deep going feeling of shame for their owners disappointment, much to their raising horror.<br />
Another consequence of the light hit on their noses was them turning black and wet. Also, with Dean taking his hands away, both slowly grew a short muzzle, as if their owners touch and movement initiated it. They hadn´t thought about it, but that was how Dean controlled their changes.<br />
As Dean had planned a bit ahead, he already knew what names they should have, but he feigned thinking about it a bit. Then, grinning down at them, he renamed them. “I know. Fro now on, I will call Jeff Champ instead, and Micha will be Rex now. Do you like your new names? Speak up!”<br />
Jeff wanted to protest about being called Champ, but as soon as sound again left his new muzzle, all he did “say” was: “Ruff ruff...” His eyes widened as he realized he could not speak anymore.<br />
Micha also wanted to protest against Rex, but also just barked. But he continued it in his anger, showing his displeasure.<br />
Still grinning down at them after a quick check of the time, Dean rubbed both their bellies again. “Calm down, you don´t need to worry about that anymore. Just let go off that control, let the puppy get out to me. You are such good boys aren´t you?”<br />
It was the ten minutes mark, meaning the changes had just finished. Suddenly, Jeff felt a push in his mind as Champ took over his body, pushing him to the back of his own mind, but he remained aware, just couldn´t get back into control. Micha had a similar situation, being pushed back by Rex, unable to resist.<br />
Dean grinned down at his new puppies, seeing their eyes shining in childlike curiosity, while the underlying knowledge had dimmed away. Jeff and Micha were now locked away for a year, maybe longer or even forever, behind the newly created puppy-minds of Champ and Rex. “Who are my good boys, huh? You two are.” And he continued to rub their bellies.<br />
Both Champ and Rex let their tongues roll out, enjoying the belly-rubs their owner gave them. It was programmed into their minds that Dean was their loving and caring owner, and they would by loyal to him like their packs leader. But they would still need to learn everything, even if they had an inkling what some commands meant.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, after more belly-rubs and petting, Champ and Rex were playing tug with one of Jeff´s former worn socks, much to the disgust of both Jeff and Micha, who could still taste it. The puppies had no problem with it.<br />
Meanwhile Dean was sitting at Jeff´s desk, dialing the vet´s office. A check-up would be needed, as well as vaccinations and chipping his pups. He decided against neutering them, and would just make sure they wouldn´t breed with the chronivac. But he mentioned neutering them loudly after the call was over, making sure both pups heard him. And while the pups had no idea, Jeff and Micha were mentally screaming bloody murder at Dean. He couldn´t neuter them. What if after changing back they would still be neutered?<br />
Dean thought about making them think they had been neutered for a bit, just to torture them a bit more. If he ever let them change back, they would have their parts intact, no damage done physically. And mentally, well, if he trained Champ and Rex good enough, maybe it would bleed into their minds as well, making them obedient and trained as well.</p>
