<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ten minutes!&quot;<br />
<br />
The soldiers within the transport carrier nodded, preparing their weapons and double checking equipment as they prepared to disembark.  For Watchdog, this was just another mission.<br />
<br />
Watchdog was an elite special forces unit within the U.S. government. Founded almost 80 years age, they consisted of the elite of elite special forces, reporting directly to the president. They also understood something that the general population didn&#39;t know. The government had been at war with the supernatural for decades.<br />
<br />
It was the Normal and specifically the Boss that had organized this black ops team after he won the presidency. If the Normal were to win, they needed soldiers. Quickly they realized the best soldiers were the ones the military had trained. All they needed was a leader and the Boss had the perfect person in mind for that job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jackson you should go talk with Blackbird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson was new to the unit, a former Delta squad member that had been recruited by the current administration. After learning of the threat the supernatural posed, he was only to eager to join. Still, being a young man, he couldn&#39;t help but oogle the beautiful red haired Blackbird. The woman looked to be in her late twenties, her attention focused solely on the book she was reading, Ann of Green Gables. Approaching slowly, he now smoothed his uniform as he tried to flirt, only to have Blackbird to press a knife firmly to his throat.<br />
<br />
Ann sighed in annoyance as the startled soldier quickly retreated to his laughing comrades. This was a hazing ritual Watchdog did to all the new guys. Ann despised it but, brushed it off for the sake of morale. When she had traveled to the past with the rest of the Normal, the Boss decided to make Ann an even more formidable warrior. This meant ageing the eight year old vampire into her physical prime. Ann now was indeed stronger, faster, and more fearsome than before. Still, she did miss being a child. Women&#39;s undergarments weren&#39;t as comfortable and her beauty drew unwanted male attention. At the end of the day all Ann wanted was to read her book and murder. <br />
<br />
The teams mission today was to eliminate members of Fukushu&#39;s resistance. After leaking false information about the location of important Normal structure, they were to ambush the resistance and eliminate as many of the resistance as possible. Touching down, the team exited quickly, Ann relaying her instructions as she ventured off on her own.<br />
<br />
*****************************<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron do you see anything,&quot; Darren asked. The kintaro turned, a frown forming on his face. After gaining a lead on a possible location on the Normal&#39;s time machine, Darren and several others had infiltrated the area hoping to find something. So far, nothing had been found causing the group to begin to worry. &quot;Hsu Hao has your team found anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing,&quot; Hsu Hao replied over the radio, the grey kitsune narrowing his one eye as he scanned the area. &quot;Aaron this doesn&#39;t feel right. Perhaps we should withdraw.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five minutes,&quot; Aaron replied. &quot;Then we go. I&#39;d hate to go back with nothing only to find out we missed something.&quot; Darren agreed, moving with Mia and Zack to another location. So far Mia had kept Zack calm but, Darren could see that the feral werewolf was beginning to become agitated. &quot;Its okay Zack,&quot; Mia soothed. &quot;We&#39;ll be heading home soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Darren, Mia, and Zack turned a corner they failed to notice the strike team positioned above them. With but a single command they now began to fire, Darren, Mia, and Zack barely avoiding being hit. &quot;Its a trap,&quot; Mia exclaimed, the witch now useing her magic to shield themselves. &quot;Aaron pull back it&#39;s Watchdog!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron lept behind cover, avoiding the barrage of bullets that now rained down upon him. Unfortunately the tanuki and satyr with him were not as fortunate. Aaron snarled as he watched his comrades collapse to the ground. Their bodies riddled with bullets. &quot;Bastards,&quot; he screamed as he unleashed a barrage of fire of his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fall back,&quot; Hsu Hao yelled, the grey kitsune now ducking  behind a wall as his blue dragon teammate fell dead. The kitsune feeling a pang of guilt as he gazed at the bullet hole in the young Dragons head. &quot;Rendezvous at the extraction point. Mia, get the portal ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Darren now began to retreat with Mia, he used his own magic to improve his own skills. Deflecting bullets and countering with spells that shattered the area around his attackers. The battle was intense, Darren hearing bullets whiz by his ear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Watch out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia&#39;s warning was late, Darren caught off guard as he felt something slam into him. Dazed, he now tried to clear his head. As he did, he gaped at the auburn haired woman who seemed vaguely familiar. &quot;Ann,&quot; Mia screamed, the witch launching a spell at the vampire. Ann dodged effortlessly, snarling before turning back to Darren. &quot;Wait that&#39;s Ann,&quot; he exclaimed. Before he could ask another question, the vampire lunged at him. Darren blocking the attack with the Dragons Tongue. He would have to ask later why the child vampire was an adult. For now they needed to escape.<br />
<br />
Darren&#39;s eyes now began to flow as he began to attack. Although his skills had improved since his first encounter with the vampire, the now adult Ann was able to match his every move. Growing frustrated, Darren tapped deeper into his powers, unleashing a blast that now sent the vampire crashing through a wall.<br />
<br />
Ann groaned as she dusted herself off. She remembered this boy from before. The last time she had easily bested him, obviously he had been training yet she still would have defeated him if not for whatever power dwelled within him. As she began to rise, she paused as an elderly man held out a hand to help her up. &quot;Looks like you could use some help Ann.&quot;<br />
Ann rolled her eyes, casting Rick an incredulous look. Rick must have been bored to show up here. Letting out an exasperated sigh, she now silently beckoned him to follow as they looked to finish off the resistance.<br />
<br />
Darren and Aaron were providing cover as the resistance began their retreat. Obviously this was an ambush, the Normal luring them here in order to eliminate them. Already they had lost several members with a few wounded. &quot;Hsu Hao let&#39;s go,&quot; Aaron bellowed as he fired his weapon. The kitsune nodded, dragging an injured nekomata with him. As they closed in, Aaron and the others gasped as two figures now appeared.<br />
<br />
Rick smirked, the wizard now summoning forth his stolen scythe as he looked between Aaron and Hsu Hao. With a wave of his hand Rick now used the shaman magic he had stolen to attack the injured nekomata.<br />
<br />
The nekomata never stood a chance, the catwoman writhing in agony as Rick transformed her. She began to shrink, her limbs reforming, her body twisting, and her mind being wiped away. In seconds where a cat woman stood was now an ordinary house cat. A cat Rick now ruthlessly butchered by reaping her soul. Sensing what was about to happen Aaron, Hsu Hao, and Zack lept at their would be executioners with Mia screaming to stop.<br />
<br />
Rick could only chuckle, beckoning the attackers forward as Ann lept into action. The grey kitsune never stood a chance, Ann quickly besting him before tearing his heart out. As the kitsune now fell to the ground dead, Rick struck Aaron, grasping him in an invisible barrier. &quot;After all these years,&quot; Aaron smirked. &quot;Your soul is finally mine!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren screamed, watching as Rick now began to drain the life force from Aaron. Already he could see the kintaro grow paler, his eyes rolling into the back of his head. Ann had already stopped Zack, wrestling the werewolf away. Darren needed to act now or both Zack and Aaron would die.<br />
<br />
With a yell the teen now unleashed a powerful blast of magic, knocking Rick and Ann and stunning them. Quickly he now teleported the unconscious werewolf and kintarobaway before stepping into Mia&#39;s portal and vanishing.</p>
