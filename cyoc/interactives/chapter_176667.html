<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morgan and May were busy as could be before Morgan won the office raffle. She was pregnant with a boy and would soon give birth in a few weeks. Morgan&#39;s husband died shortly after the announcement that the baby would be a boy in a car accident. That&#39;s when Morgan decided that they needed break from working too much. And as she won the office raffle, she decided to come here with her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; replied May. &quot;I guess we should start looking around for anything interesting!&quot; They looked around the resort, hoping to find something good they can do. They kept looking around until they reached the animal wing. &quot;How about that?&quot; asked Morgan. &quot;The animal wing seems fun.&quot; At that point, May was texting some of her friends on her phone, so she replied with a simple, unenthusiastic &quot;Ok, Mom.&quot; <br />
<br />
As they entered the animal wing, they were greeted by several sections with many animal options to transform into. &quot;Ok, May, now what?&quot; Morgan asked. &quot;Huh?&quot; said May. &quot;Oh, uh....&quot; There were so many options that May couldn&#39;t decide. Again, they walked around the wing, looking at all the options. They the options of being a snail, crab, frog, worm. May shuddered at the thought of being a worm. after a few moments of walking by the sections, they stumbled upon the bovine section. &quot;How about that.&quot; said Morgan. &quot;May wasn&#39;t paying attention and continued to text her friends. &quot;May!&quot; She said. &quot;Wha-what?&quot; She said, startled. She put her phone in her pocket. &quot;What did you say?&quot; Morgan replied, &quot;I said, do you want to try that.&quot; She said as she pointed to the bovine section. &quot;Uhh, ok, I guess.&quot; <br />
<br />
They went over to the stand and spoke to the person who worked at the stand and got the serum in order to turn into bovines. Then, they walked out of the wing and into their hotel rooms. As they entered their room, Morgan sat down on her bed. &quot;Man, walking is really hard when you&#39;re pregnant!&quot; Morgan said. &quot;Uh-huh.&quot; Replied May, again her phone. They cleaned themselves up and changed their clothes. After all that, Morgan decided that they can drink their transformation serums. &quot;All right,&quot; She said, shifting her bloated stomach. &quot;are you ready May?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I guess so.&quot; Said Mary, Serum in hand. They clinked glasses, then took a swig from the formula.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t feel anythi-&quot; May said, as suddenly, her chest Barreled out. Her head was suddenly elongated and her teeth rearranged. Her fingers and toes fused together and formed hooves. May&#39;s slim figure suddenly became non-existent was she was way bigger now. May could feel her spine extending out to form her tail. Hairs grew on the tip of her newly formed tail, and on her arms and legs. Morgan grew horns and fur. May looked down on her chest, but all she could see was white fur, and no breasts. That scared her a little, thinking of what would come next. Their clothes begin to rip and tear into pieces, leaving them practically naked. Both of them were breathing heavily as the changes brought a lot of new sensations and feelings to them. Morgan&#39;s hips clicked, preventing her from standing upright like she was used to. She didn&#39;t notice at first, since she was still changing at her upper portions. Morgan&#39;s neck extended and more muscles formed to help secure it from breaking. Her skull moved her eyes to the side, preventing her from moving forward. May&#39;s vagina and asshole slowly slide down her nether regions, resting beneath her tail, which was waging uncontrollably. Morgan&#39;s legs and hips widen, as to prepare for something. Then, a bulge starts growing between her legs. It felt squishy, and stretchy. It continued growing as four nubs begin to form, and new nerve endings form on them, making them very sensitive. It grew larger and larger until Morgan was practically doing the splits. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes of additional changes toothier internal organs and bone structure, they were now fully bovines. Both Morgan and May were still breathing heavily. &quot;I-is it over?&quot; Asked May, wobbling a bit in her new form. &quot;I-uh, I think so.&quot; replied Morgan. They wobbled towards the giant mirror on the wall and started looking at their new forms. May couldn&#39;t believe that this was her. A cow. She looked at her mother and realized two things that were different with her. Her mother&#39;s stomach and udder were noticeably larger than her own. Oh yeah, they had udders now. Morgan&#39;s udder was more bloated and veiny, while hers was more flat and small. It must&#39;ve been that Morgan was pregnant, and that her body was getting ready for a calf. It was a weird feeling for the both of them, to have four breasts between their legs, except Morgan&#39;s was more tight and compact. The fact that Morgan&#39;s udder was constantly rubbing and touching her legs was irritating, and felt interesting. They looked at themselves for a bit, putting the fact that they were cows now to their minds. &quot;Wow&quot; said Morgan. &quot;This-this is incredible! I haven&#39;t experienced anything like this before! I wonder what life being a cow would feel like!&quot; May wasn&#39;t as enthusiastic as her mother though, and she was kind of nervous. &quot;Mom, you&#39;re huge.&quot; she said. Morgan looked at the mirror and did realize that her daughter was right. Her stomach was almost circular and her udder bounced like a water balloon. &quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; She said. She looked at her stomach and compared it to May&#39;s. Then her udder. It was painfully large, and it felt like a whoopee cushion was glued to her crotch, and was hypersensitive. &quot;Must be the pregnancy. Dang, I didn&#39;t know it would be that big. Do all cows feel like this?&quot; Morgan said. &quot;Hey, mom? Will you be ok?&quot; Asked May. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine, sweetie. I just have to get used to lugging these new assets around.&quot; replied Morgan. &quot;Oh well.&quot;</p>
