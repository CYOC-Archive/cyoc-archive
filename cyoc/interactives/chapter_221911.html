<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hillary looked around. Sneaking into her own house, ashamed and embarrassed. She knew her… body probably appeared normal to others, but she didn’t wanna risk it. She didn’t see Andrew, thinking maybe he’d actually gone out for once. “Well, that’s not nice. Maybe I should try to be nicer to him. Lord knows I could use some support of my own, right now. Oh well. I think I’m in the clear.” Hillary thought to herself. Maybe, once this ended, if this ever ended, she could try and repair her relationship with him.<br />
<br />
Hillary needed to stop. She had to put her phone down, sit down, take a deep breath and relax. And she tried to; the problem was, the more she thought about it, the harder it got to comprehend.<br />
<br />
Losing weight, her skin looking smoother, maybe even a cup size increase - that could all be… hormones, or something? Right? It didn’t have to be some mystical change that was happening to her, maybe she was going through… a second puberty, or something. This, though… saline breast implants, appearing underneath her skin. This was wrong. Something was going on. And Hillary felt like there was only one thing that could prove her theory - and ease her anxieties.<br />
<br />
“Oh… I can’t believe I’m doing this.” Hillary said to herself, opening up more porn on her phone. However, a thought went through Hillary’s mind. *Look under the bed.* This didn’t feel like a regular thought to her, almost like a guide, a spiritual helper through this fucked up journey she was experiencing.<br />
<br />
And underneath her bed, she was shocked to find a box. One she hadn’t remembered putting there. *Open it.* Hillary obeyed and was rewarded with…<br />
<br />
…a pink dildo! Hillary was excited - her mind told her that this would be a new experience, far better than just her fingers. Yet she was even more anxious - something was definitely changing around her. To ease this tension within herself, she went back to her porn. To her delight, that sexy bimbo she’d been watching had a friend. <br />
<br />
The other porn star was a sexy MILF, plastic from tits to ass, lip fillers to nose job. Hillary felt her pussy get even more soaked, her nipples harden. She was both attracted to this new porn star, almost as much as the first one, and seeing her in another light, one that told her she could be more like her.<br />
<br />
The camera work made sure to show off this sexy new lady, getting great angles of her undressing and teasing Hillary’s bimbo porn star - and by extension, Hillary herself.<br />
<br />
Hillary teased herself, tweaking one of her nipples and ever so gently pressing the tip of the dildo to her waiting lower lips. <br />
<br />
The bimbo porn star and her plastic MILF counterpart were making out, now, and Hillary was shoving a bit of the tip of the dildo inside her ever-soaking pussy, savoring the pleasure she got from it.<br />
<br />
Finally, the two porn stars began fucking. Hillary had been savoring their foreplay, but now she was ready to masturbate. She shoved the dildo deep inside her needy pussy, getting about half of it inside of her, and getting more in each time she pumped it in and out of herself. That friendly voice returned, quelling any anxieties that arose in Hillary’s mind.<br />
<br />
*It’s good to like lesbian porn* the voice whispered, easing any tension in Hillary’s mind, allowing the porn to continue arousing her.<br />
<br />
*There’s nothing to feel guilty about* *Liking women isn’t a crime* *Listen to your pussy* *You love women* *Women with plastic surgery are even hotter* *Let them be your role models*<br />
<br />
Hillary’s mind fully accepted these new thoughts, even if she wasn’t conscious of them - right now, she was focused on the porn. She imagined herself as the sexy MILF - a word she didn’t even know existed until about a week ago - fucking the plastic bimbo she’d been lusting after for the past few days. Another part of her imagined herself in between the two porn stars, greedily enjoying both of their sexy plastic bodies. She came, hard, but kept going, unable to stop herself. She loved the feelings the orgasms gave her, though part of her still felt guilty-<br />
<br />
*There’s nothing to feel guilty about. Give in to your desires.*<br />
<br />
And just like that, she was fully focused on the porn again. Watching their huge pairs of big tits barely move, the hard implants stretching their smooth skin. She looked at the huge asses, obviously not natural, and felt a combination of envy and desire toward them. Her own ass was starting to feel neglected - a thought she wouldn’t have dreamt of having just an hour ago - though she pushed that thought away to focus on how much she WANTED these women, these… sluts! Hillary came again, for the 6th time, doubling her record from before, her stamina still going strong. She was going to finish this porn, no matter how many orgasms it took.<br />
<br />
Minutes later, and finally running out of energy, she finally found her answer. After cumming for the tenth time, the wonderful porn finally ended. Hillary collapsed back into bed, allowing her dildo to come out of her hand.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t stop panting and moaning, a wonderful feeling deep inside of her. The warmth was back, just as strong as before.<br />
<br />
She could feel even more wrinkles disappear from her face, her hair thickening again. The light brown hair was quickly turning a dirty blonde. Her face got a bit more makeup on it, her lips looking a little bit puffier, as if she’d just gotten her first set of lip injections.<br />
<br />
Hillary could feel her body hair thinning out - this hadn’t happened before, a strange but pleasurable feeling, especially around her crotch as the hair became less noticeable and lighter in color. Her stomach, already shrunk from the last time, became even tighter, though maybe still on the curvier side.<br />
<br />
Her breasts changed next. She felt them grow another cup size, the natural fat and skin expanding beneath her nipples. Then, she felt another cup size grow in, this time from her implants. She moaned as she felt them grow, the former uncomfortableness of the situation now feeling more like a nice hot shower.<br />
<br />
Hillary’s rear changed, next, the slightly flabby and relatively small asset becoming firm and almost athletic. Those warm thoughts returned. *A Brazilian butt lift, just like porn stars.* Hillary almost moaned at that. She was almost like those porn stars, the women she couldn’t admit she loved watching. That scared her, just like it did before, but not as much - and a tiny portion of her, just a little bit, loved the idea and was extremely aroused by it.<br />
<br />
Just when Hillary thought she was done, she could feel that warmth once again in her already changed ass - her cheeks expanded a bit, and suddenly, she had ass implants. Not very large ones, more for just a bit more firmness after her BBL, her brain told her. And just as suddenly as it started, her new round of changes was over.<br />
<br />
Not quite as scared anymore of these new changes, she accepted this information, rolled over in bed, and fell asleep.</p>
