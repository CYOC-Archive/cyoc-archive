<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I silently wished that Chloe would grow bigger - taller and more muscular- whenever she got excited, like through fear, anger, stress or whatever. And that she would return to normal size when she calmed down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an idea.  Just relax and play along with me, &quot; I said to Chloe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, &quot; said Chloe.  &quot;Maybe we should just make a run for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could tell she was pretty scared.  I looked back at her.  Already it looked like it was working.  Chloe had clearly grown a few inches, almost up to 5 feet in height.  She tugged a little at her clothes.  I hoped she didn&#39;t peak too soon. It would spoil my surprise for these punks.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No way.  We wouldn&#39;t make it.  Besides, do you to want to run away and be a coward for the rest of your life?  I think it&#39;s time someone taught these kids a lesson.  Just trust me, and follow my lead,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Chloe sighed and relaxed a little, slowing her growth.  I smiled.  This was going to be fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you!  Yeah, you little assholes.  What the hell do you think you are doing?&quot; I said loudly.<br />
<br />
The kids continued to spout obscenities, then walked over to us.  They formed a small semicircle around, surrounding us and blocking our escape.  I heard a stretching noise.  Chloe was obviously getting scared again.  I patted her hand to calm her down. I didn&#39;t want to play my Ace too quickly.  Where was the fun in that?<br />
<br />
The lead boy stepped forward, menacingly shaking his bat at me.  &quot;You got a big mouth, mister.  Maybe I should knock it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; I said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why not?&quot; he said angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it would make my friend mad.  And you wouldn&#39;t like her when she gets mad.  Things can get ugly,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
I gently bumped Chloe&#39;s shoulder and gave her a nod.  She looked at me in shock, but understood what I was getting at.  She began to grunt and groan, flexing just like the Hulk.<br />
<br />
The boy looked at her with a mixture of shock and amusement.  Then he suddenly started laughing.  The others quickly joined in.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You have to be kidding?  That little runt?  Do you always get your little sister to fight for you? I mean what is she ... in grade school?&quot; asked the kid.<br />
<br />
Chloe stepped forward, flushed with anger.  Chloe&#39;s lack of development was a sore spot for her, and it always made her mad when people pointed it out to pick on her.  The kid had made a big mistake.  I saw that she had shot up to 5 and a half feet in height.  Her shirt was now riding up a little, and I could see a nice tight six pack.  If anyone else noticed, they didn&#39;t say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;You listen here you little asshole!  I am in high school.  And you better show the proper respect for your elders.  Or else...&quot; said Chloe, poking a finger in his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or else what?&quot; said he boy.<br />
<br />
Chloe looked a little nervous, then I motioned for her to continue the charade and flex.  &quot;Or else I am going to kick your ass.  All of your asses,&quot; she said.  She flexed, and was surprised to see small bicep muscle bulging.  She turned back to me in shock. I just smiled and encouraged her to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough of this shit.  Just give us your money, or we are going to beat YOUR asses.  Both of them,&quot; said the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck off, &quot; said Chloe.  She was feeling more confident as she felt a little stronger.  And her anger at the indignity of the little creep was building.  It made her bolder.  She spit in his face.<br />
<br />
The boy glared at her, wiping the spit off his face.  He dropped his bat, stepped forward and slapped her, knocking her to the ground. The crowd gasped in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen you munchkin bitch, you better show me some respect or I&#39;ll stomp you into the ground,&quot; said the boy.<br />
<br />
Chloe lay on the ground, groaning and writhing.  I could tell she was really mad now.  This was going to be good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, boy.  I would apologize if I were you. Before it is too late, &quot; I said looking down at Chloe.<br />
<br />
The boy scoffed, looking down at Chloe moaning and flexing on the ground. &quot;Give it up.  Your little act isn&#39;t fooling anyone. I am through playing with you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
When he turned around to retrieve his bat, Chloe stood up.  She was now six feet tall with the muscular body of a fitness instructor.  Her clothes hung tightly across her body, ready to split.  They were already stretched to the limit, with her shirt cuffs at her elbows and her pant cuffs at her knees.  The crowd gasped when they saw the new Chloe.<br />
<br />
She wiped some blood off her lips.  &quot;Listen, little boy.  I haven&#39;t even started playing with you yet. Turn around and let&#39;s get started,&quot; she said in a deeper voice.<br />
<br />
The boy turned with an angry expression.  But his jaw dropped when he saw the new Chloe.  &quot;What the fuck?&quot; he said softly.  His gang looked at him expectantly, waiting for him to do something.  He couldn&#39;t look weak in front of his gang.  He didn&#39;t know what kind of trick this was, but he wasn&#39;t going to fall for it.  Even if she looked a little taller, she was just a girl.  He could take her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s play, &quot; said the boy, as he stepped forward and swung the bat.  Chloe lifted her arm defensively, and the bat connected with her forearm.  There was a sickening crunch, and I was sure her arm was broken.  I began to think this was a mistake. I didn&#39;t want her to get hurt.  Maybe I should have just wished that she had fighting skills, martial arts training or something.  But soon it didn&#39;t matter.<br />
<br />
Chloe held her arm in pain.  &quot;Owww, &quot; she groaned.  &quot;That hurt.  You hurt me. That makes me mad.&quot;  Chloe&#39;s voice got deeper, and she shot up 5 inches in height.  Her muscles bulged, growing thicker and more defined.  She began to look like a female body builder.  Her clothes ripped apart, leaving her clad in only her undergarments.  She grabbed the boy by the neck with her uninjured arm and lifted him off the ground.  She squeezed his throat and face turned red.  He slapped at her with the bat, and she dropped him.  She was furious now, towering over him at 7 feet.  She ripped the bat from his hands, and snapped it in half across her thick powerful thighs.  Then she reached out and grabbed the boy by the throat again.<br />
<br />
Most of his gang fled, but a few brave souls ran up to assist their friend.  They hit her with bats, or tried vainly to punch something vital.  But her muscle was too dense for their blows to have any effect.  Well, other than to anger and annoy her.  She turned and faced her attackers, dispatching them one by one.  Either by throwing them through the air or striking them with a powerful blow.<br />
<br />
Finally, only the boy was left.  He was trying to crawl away on the ground.  Chloe was now almost 9 feet tall, with a body that looked like it belonged on a monster.  Insanely thick muscles bulged everywhere, with long veins snaking across them feeding the hungry tissue.  Sometime during the fight her bra and panties had snapped off and she was now nude. But it looked like she didn&#39;t care anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Chloe.  I think we made our point.  Let&#39;s go, &quot; I said, grabbing her large hand.  <br />
<br />
She turned and glared at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, &quot; she said defiantly.  Her voice was very low and deep, full of menace and power.  &quot;I am having too much fun. This asshole and his friends really pissed me off.  And now they need to pay.  What was it he said?  Something about stomping my ass into the ground.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe walked over to his prone body, and began to slam her large foot and thigh repeatedly on the ground.  I could see a pool of blood forming around him.  This had gotten out of control.  I silently wished that Chloe would return to normal.  But nothing happened.  I wished to understand why, and I suddenly knew that wishes once wished could not be reversed or undone. As I watched Chloe continue to assault the poor boy I realized I had made a big mistake.  I needed to think of something else to get her back to normal.  And soon.  It looked like she was still growing.</p>
