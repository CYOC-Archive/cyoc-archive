<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike looked around as he thought. He was very eager to start on making all the kids in the neighborhood into adults and vice versa, but where should he begin? The possibilities were a bit too open right now.<br />
<br />
But then he heard something and looked up the street. Coming their way was an African-American girl walking a brown Labrador Retriever. Mike knew who she was. That was Lizzie, a pretty friendly girl he knew before he was aged up. Glancing at the others, Mike could tell they were thinking what she&#39;d be like if she were grown up as well. Well, Lizzie would be a good choice to start aging up kids. Besides, with only Christine around the other guys, Mike thought that he ought to age up another girl to make things even. It would certainly be more fair on Aidan and put less pressure on Christine.<br />
<br />
Mike could have easily just made Lizzie an adult, but her dog inspired him to get a bit more creative. Titus wasn&#39;t really an old dog, but he had gotten pretty lazy over the last few years. Lizzie was obviously trying to help Titus lose a few pounds by going for a walk. Well, Mike was going to help Titus shed more than that. &quot;I wish that Titus would lose 3 years of maturity and Lizzie would gain them,&quot; said Mike. It might not seem like much, but 1 dog year of maturity was the equivalent of 7 human years.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Titus, move your lazy butt,&quot; said Lizzie. Titus just looked at her before continuing his plodding. Lizzie sighed with annoyance. Titus was never going to lose any weight at this rate. She blamed her sister for always giving him treats and fattening him up. Ok, she gave him treats too, but surely not as often. If only there was something to motivate Titus into moving faster.<br />
<br />
Just then, a charge seemed to go up the leash and into Lizzie. Lizzie barely registered it because Titus suddenly started picking up the pace. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s more like it,&quot; she said, not noticing at first that her voice was changing. Titus was actually moving pretty quickly and Lizzie had trouble for an instant with keeping up. But then her legs started to stretch out, lengthening her stride. The hand that was clutching the leash was getting bigger, with the fingers becoming thin and dainty. Lizzie began gaining quite a bit of height and not just because of her longer legs. Her whole body was starting to stretch up as she was going through puberty.<br />
<br />
Titus was panting happily as all the excess pounds were draining from him. But while Titus was losing mass, Lizzie was gaining mass, in all the right places. Her hips were getting rounder, adding more sway to her walk. Her butt was also rounding out into the distinctive booty that black women were known to possess. Her upper body was not going to be left out. Her chest bulged as her nipples grew on top of two rapidly-inflating orbs. Lizzie gave a few moans of pleasure as her breasts finished filling out. Her face had already been changing, becoming oval-shaped and mature. Her lips had already grew to a full, pouty shape. Her black hair grew longer before it braided itself into several thin, stylish dreadlocks.<br />
<br />
By the time Titus and Lizzie approached the group, the two of them had went from a 9 year old black girl walking a pudgy, lazy dog to a 30 year old black woman walking a slimmer, more energetic dog. Of course, Lizzie&#39;s clothes had changed to match her new body. She was wearing jeans, a t-shirt, and jacket that hugged close to her very curvy body. Of course, the two of them recognized they had been changed, but they liked this change too much to complain about it.<br />
<br />
Titus barked excitedly and headed straight for Aiden, who he recognized. Lizzie didn&#39;t mind the direction her dog was taking. In fact, she wanted a closer look at the dreamy new Aiden herself. &quot;Hey, y&#39;all, what&#39;s happening?&quot; asked Lizzie as she and Titus got close to the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m just going to change all the kids into adults and vice versa in this neighborhood,&quot; said Mike casually.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you did this? You did a pretty good job with Titus,&quot; said Lizzie.<br />
<br />
The Labrador was enjoying having his ears scratched by Aiden. Aiden grinned back at Lizzie and said, &quot;He did pretty good with you as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You took the words right out of my mouth,&quot; said Lizzie. She could already feel her grown body heating up being next to Aiden.<br />
<br />
Mike smiled to himself. Obviously Aiden and Lizzie were going to hit it off. And he could pick up the subtle signs that Bradly and Christine would be sneaking off together the first chance they got. Not a bad start for his revised neighborhood. But this was only the beginning.</p>
