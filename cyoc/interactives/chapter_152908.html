<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Waking up the next morning on our couch, I could almost have sworn it was all a dream. The hospital visit... the news... the tail... It was almost absurd enough to laugh about. It&#39;s been about four weeks now, and Molly&#39;s had to cope with some changes, to say the least. I&#39;ve been documenting them down on my computer for records and to help the doctors understand what is happening...<br />
<br />
3 days since doctor&#39;s visit:<br />
It&#39;s been 3 days since we first heard the news. Molly has been mostly locked in her room, rarely coming out to talk in person... this news has really hit her hard. The only thing she&#39;s been doing frequently as a form of communication is texting. We sometimes even call each other. It feels funny, as she&#39;s just a few meters away... this past evening she requested I get sushi on my way home from the shopping mall (buying clothes for her that might cheer her up). As I put it down and knocked she opened the door herself, and I got a good look at her since I last saw her 2 days ago... <br />
<br />
Just to start off... Molly&#39;s grown. At least I think she has. Before she used to be about a head shorter than I am, but it seems that she&#39;s grown about 4 inches in height. I never thought she&#39;d grow after 22 years of age... but here we are. Clearly, she seemed to be in good health. Her belly shirt showed off her stomach, and I could&#39;ve sworn I saw some toned muscle down there. It&#39;s strange really, because I&#39;m the one who works out of the two of us. I asked her about it, and she lifted her shirt, showing her abs. They looked really good... I had to admit. She asked if I wanted to touch them... and as I touched her toned abs, I felt that her skin had become much smoother... it was so much easier to stroke my finger across her stomach, as if her skin were slippery with oil. Only when she flexed her stomach did my fingers get slight resistance from the small grooves in her six-pack... it&#39;s all such an estranged feeling. I asked her about the rest of her body and she showed me how she looked. Her arms are bigger... and her back is more defined... amazing, yet extremely weird. <br />
<br />
Now onto the more... freaky stuff. As we looked at her body, we got to her tail. It&#39;s grown... a lot. It&#39;s now about 2 feet long, and almost touches the ground. It&#39;s also about 15 centimetres thick, and she can control it. I asked her about it, and she said that she didn&#39;t mind it as much as she used to. I also saw that while she had her hands placed on the bed, it was almost as if something had started to stretch between them... like... webbing. She saw me looking and looked down herself, almost smiling as she spread her fingers. I tell you what, this is a very weird virus... I just hope that my Molly is... still gonna be my Molly after all of this.<br />
<br />
6 days since the doctor&#39;s visit:<br />
They&#39;ve made a big breakthrough in the research field when it comes to the virus. They&#39;ve realized that within days they&#39;ll be able to create a vaccine that will completely halt the transformations. When I told Molly she was ecstatic about it, but at the same time I could tell that something was wrong. I asked her, and she sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever felt like a change that you went through in life made you realise that it was destined for you? That you felt like you needed that change?&quot; She asked, as I still held her in my strong arms. &quot;Of course. Meeting you was one of them.&quot; I said, smiling at her. She smiled sadly back, and said &quot;you&#39;re so sweet... I just feel like... deep down, this is somehow what I&#39;m destined to be... it... feels good transforming...&quot; she said, her face turning red with embarrassment, tears on the verge. I held her tighter, telling her it was alright... that we&#39;d solve everything. In reality, it kinda scared me... what if I&#39;d lose Molly to this virus..?<br />
<br />
Molly has been going through more changes since last time I got a good look at her. She hasn&#39;t grown anymore in height, so at least I won&#39;t have to worry about being the short one in the relationship. I&#39;ve noticed that her C cup breasts have definitely started growing bigger. Yesterday she wanted me to go to the mall and find a new bra for her that was a bit bigger. I understand why now. As for her tail and the more abnormal changes things look different there too. Her tail is now about 3 feet long, and reaches down to the floor. It&#39;s about as thick as my arm. What&#39;s more, is that it&#39;s started to grow some rough patches on the sides of it, along the back and at the end of it. Molly&#39;s hands are now webbed to the second knuckle, and her toes are also webbed. She&#39;s also started to develop scales on her thighs and forearms. I felt them... they&#39;re really smooth, and it&#39;s kind of cool. She thinks they look gorgeous, even though they don&#39;t really have a defined color. Her craving for fish has been growing exponentially. I caught her one night taking raw salmon out of the freezer, thawing it, and inhaling it raw. It&#39;s somehow sickening and interesting at the same time... whatever she&#39;s becoming, she&#39;s certainly a predator.<br />
<br />
9 days since first doctor&#39;s vist:<br />
Okay... so this is getting harder and harder to write... last night something happened. I came into her room last night and Molly was in her underwear. But... I noticed something below her arms, on the sides of her torso... as she breathed, her skin moved parallel to her breathing. 3 slits on each side, both sides also smattered with a few scales, which now had started to turn a vibrant blue. &quot;Uh... Molly... what&#39;s that?&quot; I asked, pointing at her sides. She looked up at me, and as I made eye contact, she looked different... her pupils were wide, and a shimmer of scales shone around her eyes and forehead, almost as if she&#39;d gone mad while putting on a blue eyeshadow. Her ears were slightly distorted, almost looking a bit fin like... she smiled at me, showing sharper teeth as well. &quot;Oh these?&quot; She raised her arms and looked down at her sides. &quot;I don&#39;t know... but it feels nice...&quot; she said. She breathed in, and her slits flared open, and she giggled with delight. &quot;I can breathe under water now too... do you think they could be gills?&quot; She asked, tilting her head. She got off the bed, and started walking towards the bathroom. &quot;Molly..? What&#39;s happening to you..?&quot; I said. She spun around, taking her bra off at the same time. &quot;I&#39;m becoming what I was meant to be... don&#39;t you think I&#39;m beautiful honey?&quot; She smiled almost wickedly, and right before my very eyes, she started changing more. <br />
<br />
She leaned forward, her now even more muscular body tense. Fingers of cartilage broke through h<br />
The skin on her back, and grew longer and longer. They started at her neck, and went down to end of her tail. As webbing fanned out in between the spines, scales started showing in patches around the big new dorsal fin that my Molly had grown... her grunts... the started becoming more monstrous... sounded a bit deeper... a bit more... gurgly... she snapped her head up at me, running her tongue over her lips, which had grown longer and pointed. She smiled as her ears fanned out into fins completely. &quot;Yes... you love this, don&#39;t you honey... you love me changing for you... becoming your pet...&quot; I was taken aback by the way Molly sounded... was she still in there...? <br />
<br />
Her tail, previously about 5 feet long, grew even more, the caudal fin at the end growing longer and bigger, as her tail started to get covered in vibrant blue scales. It grew in thickness, soon matching her own torso. Her forearms and thighs were almost completely covered by the scales too, and her feet were now more flippers than feet... her hands were webbed to the tips of her fingers, which had grown blue blackish claws. Fins made themselves known on her arms, hips, and on the sides of her tail. The ones that grew on her hips at the same time shredded her panties, giving me a clear view of the scales that now shone on her dripping sex... my Molly had become a sea creature. </p>
