<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This is the 'Goblins of the Neverending Sea' module. It's a pirate adventure.&quot; The old man said, handing a <br />
dusty book over to Logan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much sir. My group is going to love this.&quot; Logan said, dropping a ten in the tip jar and running <br />
out the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice kid, hope those dice are lucky for him.&quot; The old man said to himself.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Another one?&quot; Michael asked. The group wasn't exactly thrilled to hear that Logan had grabbed another new <br />
game system, but Michael was always the loudest about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you don't understand. I think it's some kind of supplement to AD&amp;D. The rules are exactly the same, but <br />
they fleshed out the transformation spells.&quot; Logan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, basically, it's a rulebook for AD&amp;D with more spells. Let him play it Mikey, it sounds good to me.&quot; Will <br />
said. Will was the only gamer there with enough knowledge of GM-ing to compare with Logan. As such, the group <br />
usually turned to him when it was time to discuss campaign strategy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said that last time, and my character went crazy after three sessions.&quot; Alex complained. Alex was the <br />
youngest of the group, and was prone to making mistakes like trying to look at Cthulhu.<br />
<br />
&quot;That means Logan did his job. If we left a Call of Cthulhu campaign with all our marbles, he would have <br />
failed.&quot; Will replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, whatever. Give me a character sheet.&quot; Michael said.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, the three players had made their characters, and were prepped for a high seas adventure.<br />
<br />
Michael, having seen that orc was an available race in this game, had made an orc fighter. He was so <br />
ridiculously cliched that Will thought he had tried to make a low level enemy. Will, a roleplayer at heart, <br />
wanted something different from the normal fighter + wizard + rogue combo, so he made an elf girl bard. Her <br />
seduction levels were astronomical, but her strength could have used some work. In addition, Will had coached <br />
Alex into making a human thief. It was obvious from the levels in sailing and sea monster lore, that Alex <br />
intended to fight pirate fire with pirate fire. So, now that they had their characters, the four gamers sat <br />
down and got ready to start.<br />
<br />
&quot;You all meet in a tavern-&quot; Logan began.<br />
<br />
&quot;How original.&quot; Will interjected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah thanks. Anyway, you all meet in a tavern. You don't know each other, and you don't really want to-&quot; <br />
Logan continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're telling me.&quot; Michael quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys come on! You don't know each other, or want to, but now the tavern is being attacked by goblin pirates <br />
and you have to fight together to save it.&quot; Logan finished. As the last words left his mouth, the entire group <br />
felt a strange sensation. It was as if their whole bodies were shocked. Suddenly, they simultaneously blacked <br />
out.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys? Wake up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, what's that noise?&quot; Alex asked. For some reason, he must have fallen asleep at the game table. Now he <br />
was hearing some far-off voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.&quot; Came a very feminine voice from nearby. Alex's eyes lit up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello! A girl? Where are... where am I?&quot; Alex asked as he looked around. Instead of Logan's living room, he <br />
was in some kind of wooden building. A wooden building full of green blurs and fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! The house is on fire!&quot; Michael screamed. He sounded... different though. Deeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, guys something's wrong.&quot; Came the girl's voice. It sounded familiar somehow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like maybe the house being on fire?&quot; Michael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Jesus, you listen even less now then you do during campaign intros.&quot; The far-off voice said. This time <br />
though, Alex recognized it. It was Logan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Logan? Where are you?&quot; Alex shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, guys, I feel really woozy and off balance. I can't see straight.&quot; The girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, who are you, and why are you here?&quot; Michael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who am I? Mikey, I knew you weren't a genius, but this is a bit far.&quot; The girl said. Now Alex knew where he <br />
recognized it from. There was only one person in the world so stupidly full of himself that he dared call <br />
Michael by any other name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will, is that you?&quot; Alex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah it's me. Whoa, does my voice sound different or is it just me?&quot; Will asked.<br />
<br />
Realizing that something was wrong, Alex started looking around frantically. On his left was a big green thing <br />
bumping into stuff. On his right was a pile of wood with something moving behind it. In front of and behind <br />
him was fire and more fire. That left two directions. When Alex looked up, he saw a thatch roof, definitely <br />
not the roof from Logan's living room. When he looked down, he saw himself sitting on a stone floor, wearing <br />
leather armor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, guys what happened?&quot; Alex asked, examining his body to find that it was much taller than it should <br />
have been.<br />
<br />
&quot;I AM TRYING TO EXPLAIN!&quot; Logan's voice shouted. &quot;We somehow got put into the game. You are all your <br />
characters now, and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! No, that's... I have tits!&quot; Will shouted, before proceeding to completely freak out. On the bright <br />
side, now Alex knew what was moving behind the wood pile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes you do. And with a charisma as high as yours is, they're pretty big too. Now, as I'm sure you've <br />
noticed the room is on Fucking Fire! Get out you idiots!&quot; Logan yelled.<br />
<br />
The three players complied. When they got out of the building, they were able to get their first good look at <br />
each other. Michael was an orc now, wearing chain mail and carrying an ax strapped to his back. He had long <br />
greasy black hair that was tied up in a (manly) ponytail. On top of that, he was huge. He had to be at least <br />
seven and a half feet tall. Will, on the other hand, was huge in a very different way. The former guy now <br />
sported a very curvy figure with Double D's. His hair was elegant and blonde, and showed off his now pointed <br />
ears. He was wearing a very tight leather vest over equally tight clothes. At his waist hung a rapier. Alex <br />
looked relatively the same, just older. He was now a twenty something year old with a five o'clock shadow and <br />
a full suit of black leather armor that most likely had dozens of hiding places for a dagger or two. <br />
Otherwise, he looked the same. Same skinny build, same dirty brown hair, same dazed expression, of course this <br />
time the last one was excused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; said Will, &quot;Where's Logan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, he must still be in there!&quot; Michael said, making to run back into the fiery death that used to be a <br />
tavern.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm not in there, or that world. I'm sort of between it and ours. It's hard to explain, but that's what <br />
it feels like.&quot; Logan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how can we hear you?&quot; Will asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like any good spy, I am inside your head. Literally.&quot; Logan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;In that case, sorry for the cramped accommodations. I'm sure Mikey and Alex have more empty space for you.&quot; <br />
Will said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Will, it's a shame. Ruining that body with your irritating chatter.&quot; Michael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem, would you like to continue the campaign or not? Because your way out of this doomed town is currently <br />
on the docks.&quot; Logan said. As he did, all three looked over at the docks to see a pitifully small boat waiting <br />
for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it's better than nothing.&quot; Alex said as he began walking over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. This could be cool though. We're actually going to be our characters.&quot; Will said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because that's what we needed to give you, more reason to roleplay.&quot; Michael said, tagging along beside his <br />
companions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, I think you're forgetting something.&quot; Logan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Provisions? Better gear? A map? To turn off the kitchen sink?&quot; Will asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is gonna be a long campaign. No, I mean the town is still being raided by goblins.&quot; Logan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, that.&quot; Alex said.</p>
