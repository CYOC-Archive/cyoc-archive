<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Written by Orphelsion<br/>
Edited by ChronoSeth, Orphalesion</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Left to your own devices, you spend some time just trying to absorb what has happened in the last few hours. This morning you were successful in trying to drag your sleepy, slobby friend Keith to get enrolled in a university.<br />
<br />
Since then, you had accidentally transformed him into a completely different man, who <i>also</i> threatened you at gunpoint. And now you were in an expensive hotel and Keith was kind of back, but not fully himself or something?<br />
<br />
You can’t comprehend the conclusion, the only apparent thing is the fact that it all started with the car keys being zapped by that <i>Morpho Cola</i> vending machine...<br />
<br />
You stare with a frown at the car keys lying on one of the beds. You still don&#39;t quite understand <i>how</i> they can change things. Was it random? Was it according to some design? Keith - or was it Vinnie? - demonstrated some control over them when he changed your car, and Keith outwardly acted as if he was having fun being Vinnie… Maybe you could try altering and changing yourself too...?<br />
You stare into the mirror, seeing your body that you were familiar with for a good chunk of your life. The body that grew uniquely in your growth spurt, different and comfortable for you, and <i>only</i> you alone. <br />
<br />
Imagining the form you could have, the muscles, perhaps, or the complete stranger that could be in the mirror, confidently smirking at you got you to sport a chub. But your mind took a downward spiral when you also thought of the possibilities that could harm you...<br />
...No! <i>No</i>… you quickly abandon that thought. These things happened in a process incomprehensibly random, who <i>knows</i> who&#39;d you end up as... Plus, at least for a while, Keith was completely Vinnie, and you don’t want to lose yourself like that, not alone that is. If Keith was here, he could perhaps monitor or help you in regulating the change. He seemed to have more control…<br />
In the end, you flop on the bed, staring at the keys that held so much <i>power</i>, but with your level of control, could cause irreparable mistakes. With a sigh, you end up watching TV until Keith returns from his workout. A bit of a moment passes and you chuckle. There was just something wrong with “Keith” and “workout” being in the same sentence.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Keith… Vinnie… returns to the room, winking at you as he struts to the bathroom to take a shower, the trailing musk of his workout body scent wafting over to you. The sounds of bathing went on for quite some time until the showerhead stops.<br />
After the shower, another surprise greets you… Keith walks out of the bathroom stark naked. This gives you a good look at his toned body… and the huge, uncut cock dangling between his legs. That&#39;s… different. Before the keys, you never saw Keith naked, and he was always <i>especially</i> skittish about letting people see his manhood. Now, he was walking around the room giving a show as casually as if he did this every day.<br />
<br />
You feel your cock harden and swiftly make an attempt to hide it by crossing your legs, Keith notices, smirks, and gives you another cocky wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow… Keith, this new body <i>really</i> gave you a boost in confidence...&quot; You remark with a flushed grimace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... I&#39;m feeling mortified right now tizio,&quot; Keith corrects you as he puts one of the suitcases he brought from the car on the bed and opens it with a click, &quot;and while I <i>personally</i> don’t want to strut around naked in front of you, but… Vinnie wants it...&quot; He rummages through the clothes, none of them meeting his approval, &quot;He was also the one who made me work out. I&#39;m freaking <i>exhausted</i>, compadre, but he keeps me going somehow...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You alright Keith?&quot; You ask with concern, aimed solely at your friend, &quot;We could try changing you back...&quot; You move to pick up the keys, but Keith scoops them up before you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cazzo, no,&quot; he asserted and displays his naked, toned body to you, &quot;look at me, tizio, I look amazing. Plus...&quot; he smiles, and for that moment it&#39;s Keith&#39;s smile, not Vinnie&#39;s, &quot;This whole thing is kind of exciting… it&#39;s like playing a video game and Vinnie&#39;s my character...&quot; For a short period, even the tone of his voice is his own again. For that <i>one</i> moment he&#39;s completely Keith; a slob of a dork who&#39;s excited about suddenly having a hot, muscular body.<br />
But that moment passes and as he cracks his neck, his posture, facial expression, even the look in his eyes returns to being Vinnie; confident, hot, dangerous.<br />
<br />
He turns around to look at the hotel bathrobe hanging next to the bathroom door, scrutinizing gaze imagining something else, aiming at it with the keys and with an audible click a ripple goes through the robe as it morphs into a dark garment bag, the type you get at expensive dry cleaners.<br />
Keith takes it off the hook and puts it on the bed, unzipping it to reveal a cream-colored, vintage-looking double-breasted suit with black pinstripes. He smiles approvingly. <br />
You can’t help but marvel at the control Keith exercised over the keys, and how his reactions radically changed. The old Keith would have never put on a suit like that. Actually, any suit at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to the hotel bar,&quot; Keith informs you without missing a beat. Once again you&#39;re taken aback by the difference; the old Keith would have never told you what the two of you were going to do. He either went with the flow or would have continuously hinted at what he wanted to do in the hopes that you&#39;d suggest it. This version of Keith took charge… “and we’re going to let go.”<br />
<br />
He starts dressing, putting on black socks, black silk boxer briefs along with a matching, black undershirt. You wouldn&#39;t think that a guy getting dressed would be so… <i>hypnotic</i>, but you can&#39;t lay your eyes off him.<br />
That fine black silk starting to veil Vinnie&#39;s scarred mobster skin, the way the silk underpants only highlighted his trim butt and impressive bulge, the waist of the shirt&#39;s fabric was tight enough to accentuate the contours of his perfectly cut abs and pecs...<br />
The cream-colored, pinstriped suit pants were next to come on, secured by a leather belt with a bright, silver buckle. They are joined by black and white wingtip shoes, the leather polished to shine.<br />
The buttons of a black dress shirt were closed and slightly hides Keith&#39;s muscular frame, a creme-colored tie buttoned in a perfect double <i>Windsor</i> knot that Keith could have never managed before this change. Nor could he have pulled off the way he now slicks his hair back with real pomade.<br />
To your confusion, Keith picks up the black leather gloves he had worn as Vinnie, slipping them on his meaty hands, the leather creaking and stretching against the contours of his fingers and palms as he tucks the cuffs of the gloves into the sleeves of his suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloves?&quot; you ask in confusion, &quot;I thought we&#39;re just going to the hotel bar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are, compagno,&quot; Keith confirms as he puts on the jacket of his pinstripe suit and inserts black pocket silk in his breast pocket, &quot;doesn&#39;t mean I wanna leave any fingerprints there, <i>sides</i>...&quot; he grins and smirks at you as he clenches a gloved fist, the leather straining audibly, &quot;they make me look more intimidating, capiche?&quot;<br />
<br />
He places a cream-colored trilby with a black hatband on his head, finishing up his outfit and confirming his looks were to his liking, turning around after the fact and presents himself to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like it, amico?&quot; he implored, running a gloved hand along his shoulder, the black leather contrasting wonderfully with the cream-colored suit fabric, &quot;It&#39;s called &#39;Sprezzatura&#39; and every man worth the name should possess it.&quot;<br />
He stares straight at you with judging eyes, chuckling as he gives you a look over, &quot;Maybe one day you&#39;ll get some, compadre...&quot;<br />
<br />
It takes you a moment or two to even realize that Keith, sleepy, non-confrontational Keith was talking down to you. And some part of you finds it incredibly hot. The confidence, the arrogance, the sheer charisma ... you started to like this Vinnie-enhanced version of Keith…<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; you prodded, standing up and walking over to Keith, &quot;should we get going?&quot;<br />
Keith, who was busy checking himself out in the mirror agreed, &quot;Sure, only one thing left to do...&quot; and he abruptly turns around to you, the silver car keys in his gloved hand, aiming them at you with a grin on his face.<br />
Your eyes widen in shock and take a step back in a panic. <i>No!</i> As cool as Keith&#39;s new persona was you didn&#39;t want this happening to you!<br />
<br />
&quot;Keith!&quot; you begged while simultaneously walking backward, panic in your eyes as your heart began pounding once more. You see your life flash before you, the same trauma as to when Vinnie held you at gunpoint while your heart was grieving at the thought of accidentally erasing your friend, and for a moment, you could only see Vinnie Fontana, &quot;Please! No!&quot;<br />
<br />
He visibly lowered his shoulders, the grin falling off when he saw true panic, &quot;Spiacente compagno, I can&#39;t be seen in public with you if you&#39;re looking like that...&quot;<br />
You could see Keith in Vinnie’s shadow once more, but you didn’t get to appreciate it when the audible click of the silver car keys resounded and you closed your eyes.<br />
<br />
You feel a sort of prickle enveloping your feet, a sensation almost as if they had fallen asleep. Instinctively, you look down with a creak of the eyes and are treated to the sight of your shoes… visually almost looking like pixelation in a video. Your shoes explode into a cloud of blurred &#39;pixels&#39;, the color of the pixels changes to a reddish-brown hue and a moment later your shoes solidify back into a pair of wingtip shoes, identical to Keith&#39;s except for the color.<br />
The changes rush upwards, your pants, your shirt, all being overtaken by the same pixelation and morphing into a pale brown-colored suit with a chocolate tone tie, the pixelation effect even rushes over your hands, and before you know it you feel the skintight leather of a pair of chocolate brown leather gloves encase your hands. You are now dressed similarly to Keith, only in less flashy colors.<br />
Once the pixelation ended and the prickly feeling faded away, you released the breath you were unconsciously holding. “That was uncalled for…”<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Now</i> you look decent,&quot; Keith declares as he surveys your new look. You saw his face holding the undertones of an apology, before Vinnie’s confidence in your look flared again. He turned and motioned for you to follow as he leaves the hotel room. “come, let’s go.”<br />
You take a moment to breathe out in relief, calming down and happy that Keith had only changed your clothes, appreciating the suit he gave you. You&#39;d never be able to afford one like that… and the fabric felt incredibly good against your skin, you saw him wait at the door’s open entrance and you follow along, locking the hotel door.<br />
<br />
As the two of you are in the elevator you try to remove your gloves as it felt weird to wear leather gloves indoors, especially during summer, but you are kept from doing so by Keith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those stay on, compagno.&quot; Vinnie orders you. You briefly wonder whether that was a joke, but you decide it&#39;s better not to test it.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re an associate of Vincenzo Fontano now,&quot; Keith continues with a smug grin on his face, remembering memories from that name alone, &quot;from now on your wardrobe consists of suits and gloves, and they are mandatory, <i>capiche</i>?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before you can answer that, you arrive at the hotel&#39;s ground floor and the elevator doors open. He smiles at you, and for a moment he&#39;s completely the old Keith, the friend you have known since childhood.<br />
He puts an encouraging hand on your back &quot;Let&#39;s have fun, dude!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as easily and seamlessly that Keith had fully surfaced, Vincenzo Fontana reemerged.<br />
The bar, like the rest of the hotel, is fairly upscale. As you walk in you get a lot of looks and scrutiny, people even whisper to one another. You suddenly feel <i>very</i> self-cautious about what you&#39;re wearing, you feel yourself blush, part of you wants to turn around and leave again, part of you want to sink into the ground.<br />
<br />
In contrast to you, Keith, thanks to the Vinnie persona, swaggers with utmost confidence and nonchalance, you figure Keith felt at least as mortified as you, but Vinnie allowed him to act despite that. For the first time, part of you wishes that it had been you who got transformed by the keys instead of Keith.<br />
<br />
Keith leans against the bar, &quot;Hey barista, a whiskey, straight, e velocemente!&quot;<br />
<br />
You join Keith beside him while making sure to keep your eyes on the floor so that you don&#39;t see the people staring at you, and order a beer.<br />
<br />
The barkeep delivers your friend the whiskey in a glass, watching Keith closely as he swirls the whiskey and starts drinking it. Keith always liked beer, but you&#39;ve never seen him drinking anything this strong, but he drinks the straight whiskey like water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, that&#39;s awful,&quot; he blurts, though you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell from his expression or body language, or the fact that he just keeps drinking.<br />
<br />
Confused, you ask Keith, &quot;Then why do you keep drinking it?&quot; The bartender hands you the beer and you began earnestly sipping it, intent on being sober for a bit longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vinnie made me order it. Kind of like a habit and he likes it...&quot; He looks at you, grinning, &quot;besides, I wanted to see what it&#39;s like to drink hard liquor. This body has the tolerance for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod in slight envy as you sip. Part of you wanted to try it too, but you had the habit of restraining yourself for the safety of the others. Designated driver for university parties of your <i>acquaintances</i>.<br />
<br />
He keeps drinking and lets his eyes wander across the room. Suddenly something seems to catch his interest, there is a slight smirk on his face, a certain fire in his eyes. He has seen something he wants and you already know that he&#39;s gonna go after it. You follow his line of sight and see that he&#39;s watching a very pretty young woman who is standing at one of the bar&#39;s tables. You know she&#39;s Keith&#39;s type; blond, not too tall, rather big boobs. With Keith&#39;s newfound confidence it&#39;d be a match made in heaven.<br />
The only problem was that some guy was already in the process of chatting her up. He was a rather typical frat bro, in fact, you think you might have seen him at university.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s already talking to somebody,&quot; you try to tell Keith. “It’s not good-”<br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot; he cuts you off as he downs the rest of his whiskey, &quot;I&#39;m better than him.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Keith stands up and walks straight for the pair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scusate, pal,&quot; he sneers as he grips the frat bro&#39;s shoulder and knocks him aside, making the guy spill his drink all over himself, &quot;I&#39;m gonna take it from here, the lady needs a real man,&quot; he then gives the young woman a heart-melting, captivating smile as he picks up her hand and kisses it, &quot;Don&#39;t you, bellissima?&quot;<br />
<br />
The frat bro needs a while to process what had just happened, he <i>clearly</i> wasn&#39;t the kind of guy who was used to getting knocked around like that. But he quickly collected himself.<br />
&quot;Hey! You-&quot; he protested with a growl and gave Keith a shove in the back, &quot;I saw her first, asshole!&quot;<br />
<br />
Keith turned around to the frat bro and gave him such an icy death glare that it made even you shudder. You still weren&#39;t used to how cold and… dangerous… Vinnie&#39;s eyes could be. Right now he <i>actually</i> looked like he was about to kill the guy.<br />
&quot;I said, I take it from here, <i>ragazinno</i>, so run along home, if you know what&#39;s healthy for ya...&quot; Keith’s voice and intonation is deadly, threatening, cold. <br />
<br />
For a moment you worry what might happen, but thankfully, the frat bro backs down after a moment of hesitance. Without even a single word he backs away from the table and leaves the bar soon afterward. But, as you stare at him, the guy kept looking back at Keith, a hateful expression plastered on his face.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, with Keith, or Vinnie, he was back to acting all charming and debonair to the young woman. And she didn&#39;t seem to mind Keith&#39;s treatment of the frat bro even one bit as she seemed to be completely captivated by him. A few pleasant-sounding, Italian compliments and kisses all over her arm and shoulder, the girl and Keith left the bar together.<br />
<br />
You marvel at the whole event despite being a bystander, because you’ve just seen Keith effortlessly steal a one night stand that you know the old Keith could never get <i>against someone like that</i>. It could be the buzz of the beer, you knew it could get you thinking things unrestrained. As you weigh the pros and cons of the effect the keys had on Keith, making Vinnie, seeing them have so much fun <i>as one unified being</i>, while still being your childhood friend. Slowly, you were getting envious of the fun Keith was having. A lukewarm feeling flushes your whole body as you finish your beer. <br />
Then you realized, Keith just left you here alone… Still half-sober, you stand up and quickly return to your hotel room, elevators, and such as you unlock your room and enter. Not seeing the silver keys, you forgot they were still with Keith.</p>
