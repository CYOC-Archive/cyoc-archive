<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know it isn&#39;t that far a walk from their home to here,&quot; Cody said as he locked the car. His upper front teeth now constantly poking out. If Brent had been paying attention he would have called this out. However, his back felt worse the longer he stood. &quot;sorry man I think I must&#39;ve pulled something&quot; Brent said. The ride up the elevator Brent found himself leaning forward suddenly. &quot;Brent you okay&quot; Cody went to pull him back up. He put Brent&#39;s arm over his shoulders and carried him out. &quot;no my back feels weird&quot; Brent looked a little thinner now Cody saw. He ignored a pain above his ass and unlocked the dorm room. He set Brent on his bed &quot;I&#39;m getting Randall&quot; Cody said. Brent said, &quot;Man I&#39;m fine. I just need to rest&quot;. Cody didn&#39;t listen as his tailbone was hurting. &quot;look I think that rain had something in it. I&#39;m not feeling well and you&#39;re looking thin.&quot; he closed the door and went down the hall. This left Brent to his thoughts.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Brent looked down and saw Cody was right. he had a decent amount of muscle being a jock. Now however he looked thinner. He moaned suddenly as his cock let out a lot of cum. &quot;what the...&quot; he was confused. He wasn&#39;t even aroused. He reached his hand down and unbuttoned his now-wet pants. His dick was still hard but somehow it looked smaller. He was about to pull his boxers down when he noticed his hand looked wrong.  <br />
<br />
His fingers shortened as his hand shrank. Black pads grew from his palm as black fur raced up his hand and stopped before his shirt sleeve. There was no denying his right hand was now a paw. &quot;CODY!&quot; he yelled out as he tried to get up. He only made it two steps before falling. He tried several times to get up but couldn&#39;t stand on his two feet.  <br />
<br />
Orange fur grew above the black. White fur grew on his underside? he let out another moan as his cock let out another burst of cum. he watched with shock as his left hand now mirrored his partner. While he shakingly tried to get up his shirt slipping over his head. He shook it off and looked down. He gasped as rows of nipples raced down his belly. He let out a feminine moan as his neck changed.  <br />
<br />
More cum then came from his shrinking cock. He let out a yip as one of his balls went inside him, the other followed soon. A vixen vagina formed from his scrotum. His cock let out the last bit of cum as it shrank and became her new clit. She let out a yip as something hurt her ass. Unlike the rest of her changes so far her ass grew large. Brent struggled to get his remaining clothes off. Her new tail was freed before the white fur grew on its tip. Her back legs changed to be similar to her front ones.  <br />
<br />
&#39;this has to be a dream right&#39; she tried to say. Instead, she let out a series of yips and growls. She soon found while she could understand herself she couldn&#39;t speak a word of English. Her face pushed out as her hair grew out till it almost touched the ground while she stood on all fours. As her muzzle finished growing his large pointed ears gained white fur on the inside. Black fur encircled the front part of it as she took one step in her new body. &#39;is it over&#39; she thought.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly her mind was wracked with new information. Knowledge of science, math, and computers flooded her head. She covered her head with her paws as the information continued. When Brent uncovered her head she knew what had happened. &#39;the unexpected storm contained some foreign unknown substance that when exposed to living tissue can cause several changes to the body.&#39; she blinked her eyes when she realized her IQ had gone from average to over 145. she then realized Cody and the others were exposed to the same rain. She had to get to him before he changed and warn him. There were still too many variables to know what he would change into. She rushed to her door only to come to a massive problem. With her new paws, she couldn&#39;t turn the knob. Looking around the room she saw her salvation. Her computer was lying on her desk. She used her skinny body to grab the desk.  <br />
<br />
After several messed up passwords she figured out the right angle to put her paws in to type. After getting in she carefully began typing a command to allow her connection to Cody&#39;s phone. She wished to do the same for the others. Still, she only knew her roommate&#39;s number. &#39;Tyler and Owen need to give their numbers out more&#39; she yipped out. After connecting to Cody&#39;s phone she typed {the rain changed me. Cody, you need to get somewhere safe as you were also exposed. Brent.}. She hated she had to dumb it down but time was of the essence.  <br />
<br />
With that done she typed in emergency services. {my friends and I were affected by the strange rain. I&#39;m on the third floor of the boy&#39;s dorm at nation college. Send someone else to 231 Buxton Road. So girls were affected there also.}. he then got a text back {emrecgncy services were en route. Can you describe the rain}. {yes it was multi-colored. It was a mixture of red, orange, and yellow.} she replied. She was thankful for the deaf people&#39;s function otherwise she&#39;d never be able to explain this. She typed some more about her speech being gone.  <br />
<br />
She then heard a knock at the door. &quot;MPD, Brent Stevens are you there?&quot; a male officer shouted. {the police are here. Tell them I can&#39;t open the door and it&#39;s locked} she typed. Soon the door was kicked open and two cops came in. an African male and a Caucasian female. Upon seeing Brent the two officers looked shocked. &quot;Mr. Stevons, is that you?&quot; the woman asked. Brent yipped as she pointed her head at the monitor {more like Miss Stevens but yes, have you found my roommate Cody yet?}. &quot;um no, all emergency services are a little overwhelmed by the weird storm popping up.&quot; the man said. &quot;there&#39;s an ambulance downstairs for you. Can you walk, if not we can send the paramedics in&quot; the lady officer said. Brent nodded and put herself down on all fours.  <br />
<br />
After carefully going down the stairs she and the officers approached the ambulance. &quot;here&#39;s another one for you guys&quot; the male officer explained. &quot;well at least she seems calm&quot; one of the paramedics said. Suddenly a call came on both the officer&#39;s and paramedic&#39;s radios. &quot;attention all emergency response units an affected individual is barreling down Indian Drive. Be advised that the individual is quite large and causing destruction to vehicles and city property&quot; Brent winced tight as the noise was quite annoying to her new ears. &quot;we got to go&quot; the male officer said. &quot;well drop this one off and head their next&quot; the other paramedic said. With that, the officers drove off and Brent was put inside the ambulance. She knew what was happening was out of her power but she hoped that monster wasn&#39;t one of her friends.</p>
