<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vicky stared down at what was now clearly a penis and set of testicles. The only thing she could figure out was why they looked so small and underdeveloped. Thinking, &quot;Give it time,&quot; she reached down and touched the area between her legs, torn between being happy that her privates where still present and unhappy that they hadn't vanished yet.<br />
<br />
Turning toward the running shower, she stepped in and began to bathe, going over the events that had transpired since she had found and made a wish on the note.<br />
<br />
The biggest being the formation of her penis and testicles, even if they looked underdeveloped and didn't work. The second thing she had noticed was her brother, Bryan, leaving the bathroom earlier today. But that wasn't so weird. What was weird was that he was wearing one of her shirts and what looked like her old, Hello Kitty bathing suit that she hadn't seen since she was about seven or eight.<br />
<br />
Deciding that the best course of action was to act indifferent, Vicky had passed him by without saying a word. Later on, during dinner, she had found out this was the best course of action because her mother, who was home early for some reason, did not say a thing when Bryan had shown up wearing a pair of her jeans, as well as the shirt he had been wearing earlier. Confused about this, Vicky wondered instead why her mother was home early, but decided not to ask.<br />
<br />
Now, hours later, Vicky wondered what outcomes she could expect tomorrow. She wondered if Bryan would go to school dressed like a girl. Or if she was expected to go to school dressed like a boy. Washing herself slowly, she pondered over these questions as she prepared for bed.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Inside his room, Bryan stripped off the clothes he had worn for the latter half of the day, puzzling over why it was that nobody in his family thought it strange that he was dressing in Vicky's clothes.<br />
<br />
The best answer he could think of was that maybe they already knew and where waiting for him to be honest about it. &quot;In which case, Vicky and mom should be saying something about it tomorrow,&quot; Bryan thought to himself as he reached up and pushed down the shoulder straps on the swimsuit.<br />
<br />
Taking off the bathing suit, he looked down at the area where his privates should be, confused over what was happening.<br />
<br />
Shortly after his mom had left his room, Bryan had laid down, wanting to think on the odd conversation that had passed between them. Instead, he found he couldn't really concentrate because of a rather uncomfortable feeling in his groin and abdomen. And the more he thought about it, the more he realised that the feeling was slowly growing.<br />
<br />
Unable to stand the feeling any longer, and realising that he suddenly needed to pee, Bryan had gotten up and pulling on the shirt he had covered himself with about twenty minutes later, he exited his room and headed for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Inside, he pushed the swimsuit off with minimal difficulty, but the moment it was off, Bryan nearly screamed in alarm. For, before his eyes, his penis and testicles were shrinking and what little pubic hair he did have, was slowly regressing back into his body. Scared suddenly, Bryan reached down and in a rather futile manner, gripped his privates and holding onto them, tried to keep them from doing what it was they were doing.<br />
<br />
But the gesture turned out to be a poor one and within a couple minutes, Bryan felt his penis and testicles first shift downward and then start to merge with the area between his legs. Lifting up the toilet lid, thinking, &quot;What the hell,&quot; Bryan sat down.<br />
<br />
And then, to his surprise, he suddenly felt his bladder let go and the urine exit his body from between his legs. Leaning forward, Bryan watched as his penis split...all the while he was peeing...and then settled into two locations. Unsure what he was witnessing, Bryan waited till he was finished and then gently touched the area between his legs.<br />
<br />
Taking his hand back, Bryan asked himself, &quot;Is this what a girl's privates looked like,&quot; confused slightly because at the age of fourteen, he hadn't seen a girl naked yet.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the toilet, wondering what could cause a person’s body to shift like his had just down, Bryan reached for some toilet paper and without giving it much thought, began to gently wipe dry the area between his legs.<br />
<br />
Surprised he had done this without much thought, Bryan told himself, &quot;This is too much,&quot; and standing up, he hastily washed his hands and put back on the bathing suit. But the next surprise came when he stepped out and found himself looking at Vicky, who did what she normally did...ignored him walked downstairs.<br />
<br />
Now, hours later, Bryan still could figure out what was going on. Pulling on a pair of underwear he had worn when he still had his penis and testicles, he shifted about, suddenly uncomfortable wearing them. Taking them off, Bryan wondered if he was going to need to get a pair of underwear from his sister and then shaking his head, he grabbed his pyjamas and putting them on, he flicked off the light and then climbed into bed.<br />
<br />
Lying in the dark, bothered by the feeling of the fabric of his pyjamas pressing against the now flat skin of his privates, Bryan stared up at the ceiling, wondering what tomorrow would bring and whether his body would change any more.<br />
<br />
Sticking a thumb in his mouth, something he hadn't done since he was really little, Bryan turned on his side and curled himself up into somewhat of a fetal position. Wondering where his doll was, and not at all bothered by what he was suddenly doing or thinking, Bryan slowly drifted off to sleep.</p>
