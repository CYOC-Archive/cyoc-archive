<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben was already that far into his own daydream of what he would soon become that he didn&#39;t care about his current body, or more specifically, what it does to its surroundings.<br />
<br />
With every single step he took, the sheer amount of weight and his colossal strength caused the ground to shake ever so lightly, so much so that even Sue felt a mini earthquake under her butt. She was sitting right behind the door of her room, part of herself crying because of the height she&#39;s lost and the other part was thinking about the massive consequences that would soon arise from her brother.<br />
<br />
Now back in his room, Ben looked into the mirror and noticed pretty much all of his clothes were shredded now thanks to his bulging limbs and torso. Merely a few pieces of his shirt, underwear and pants were left which he easily ripped of his body to fully inspect it.<br />
<br />
God was he massive, he thought to himself. Even unflexed his biceps were record-holding mountains of raw power. He slightly lifted his forearm and clenched his fist a bit. That alone was already enough to send shockwaves to his bicep, making it pump bigger and bigger with each clench. If he wouldn&#39;t have known better, he could swear that his muscles had a mind of their own. But if this was the &quot;burden&quot; such a gigantic man had to carry, then he would gladly oblige.<br />
<br />
As massive and impossible as his body now was, he knew he was far from done, especially since he was alone with this little but powerful device in his hands. Other than Sue who wanted to use it to hurt others, he was going to use it to never get hurt anymore ever... well, and of course to hurt some deserving individuals later down the road.<br />
<br />
Ben looked at the dial of the gun and chose an option he&#39;d already used before, but could probably never get enough of: Muscles.<br />
<br />
Just as before, he pointed the gun right at the muscular shelf that was his chest and held the trigger for quite a few seconds.<br />
<br />
He saw his vision-blocking pecs extend way futher, becoming almost a foot thick. He was glad to have a mirror in front of him, because otherwise he wouldn&#39;t be able to see the beauty that was about to unfold in his midriff. Ben saw each of his 10-pack grow out like a balloon, only to slowly shrink back in size. They were of course quite a bit bigger than before, but much, much more dense.<br />
And while his abs were still getting harder, his tree trunk legs grew downright ginormous. Each of those thighs had to be bigger than a persons torso, but filled to the brim with muscle mass. Even his calves looked far bigger than even biceps of heavy bodybuilder.<br />
As his back muscles grew into a maze of strength, he embraced his huge, heavy arms. He flexed his left biceps and saw it explode in size, even going a good chunk above his head. It radiated power and was accompanied by forearms that were beefier than ever before.<br />
<br />
He loved the reflection of the incredible man in the mirror, doing multiple poses and reveling in the feeling of raw power. Well, up until he caught sight of a rather tiny aspect of his body, at least relative to his height and the size of his muscles.<br />
<br />
His dick...<br />
<br />
...it wasn&#39;t small by to begin with at 6 inches when hard, which it currently was, but it was far away from what the epitome of masculinity should possess. He quickly searched for the right setting on the gun and got to work.<br />
<br />
Inch after inch, his dick grew from average to above average, all the way to the monster cock the was now sporting. A thick rod more than 18 inches long greeted his diamond-hard abs and lightly rubbed them.<br />
<br />
Things were going according to his plans and his liking, but he was still far from done.<br />
Ben walked over to his weights and picked up his heaviest dumbbell. Before all those changes he had a really hard time even doing a few reps with this, but now this didn&#39;t feel any heavier than a can of soda. For fun he did a few dozen reps, then let the loaded dumbbell fall to the fall with a loud *THUMP*.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in Sue&#39;s room, she was almost having a heart attack. For a short moment she thought that Ben came crashing through her door, but she was more than happy to see that this wasn&#39;t the case. But still, that loud sound couldn&#39;t be a good sign, at the very least...<br />
<br />
Ben looked at a few more options on the dial until he found one that was most intriguing, especially when looking back down at the dumbbell that lightly damaged the floor beneath.<br />
<br />
Strength, is read.<br />
<br />
Ben thought about it for a moment, imagining his colossal frame holding even more strength than anyone could guess, even at his size. The idea alone made him hard as can be, and so he got to work.<br />
<br />
Selecting it, he blasted his abs this time and didn&#39;t let go of the trigger. Immediately, he felt his muscles changing, if only internally. While they didn&#39;t gain a single inch in size at all, he noticed them getting more and more defined still. Having huge muscles was one thing, but perfectly chiseled ones as well? And it wasn&#39;t just the looks, heaps of strength entered his body with every second the gun blasted him. Harder and denser his muscles grew, holding humongous and unreasonable power within them. As soon as Ben felt the sensation got less and less, he let go of the trigger. He thought that he might have reached the max, but his muscles have just become so impossibly dense that even that seasational feeling had no chance to get all the way through to him.<br />
<br />
He moved his free hand down to the dumbbell again, only this time it was truly weightless. Not just weightless, he accidentally bend the metal bar with his mighty fingers. After realizing that he gripped one of the weight plates at the side and squeezed lightly, the metal beneath his fingers instantly gave in and deformed according to his grip.<br />
<br />
Again, he let the dumbbell fall to the ground and again Sue was terrified for a moment.<br />
<br />
Reaching down again, but for his abs this time instead of the weights, he playfully rode his hand across the many ridges of his abdominals. After some time he tried to poke them, but they didn&#39;t budge the tiniest bit. Out of curiosity, he knocked on his abs like one would knock on the door, and found the sound they&#39;re making to be very similar to a block of metal. Deep, dense and powerful was the best way to describe it.<br />
<br />
With those three things out of the way, Ben thought of his next move. He pretty much had it all. A towering height, gigantic muscles, unnecessary amounts of strength and a huge cock. What more could he want? Well, aside from new stuff, he was always up for more of the same. For him it&#39;s always been &quot;There&#39;s never too much of a good thing&quot;, and the same rule applied to his body.</p>
