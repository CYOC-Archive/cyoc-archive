<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back at Jeff&#39;s home, he had already underwent the changes into a dog and now his former pet now owner, Fifi owned the house. The rest of Jeff&#39;s family had also changed into dogs, but in this reality, they now lived in a pet store or got sold to other families. <br />
<br />
Fifi, a 26 year old female Corgi (as dogs now live as long as humans used) was currently on the Chronivac as in this reality, she was the one to have it. Jeff was just a year and a bit old, considering that the Chronivac also swapped the lifespan of dogs and humans.<br />
<br />
Fifi scrolled through the Chronivac, wondering just what she could do with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this device can supposedly change people into whatever I can think of. The question is, what do I try first?&quot; Fifi wondered to herself, scrolling through the features of the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
It was during this that Jeff was looking up to his owner, while shaking his butt happily. He lacked any higher level of thinking and could only pant in content.<br />
<br />
Fifi caught a glimpse of Jeff in the corner of her eye and looked down at him. This was when it dawned on her that she could try to Chronivac on her pet, Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here Jeffy, wanna try out something for Fifi would you.&quot; Fifi cooed as she stroked Jeff&#39;s hair, causing Jeff to wag his butt more.<br />
<br />
Fifi loaded up a screen on the Chronivac and began to type in a change that would test whether it worked.<br />
<br />
This is the changes<br />
Name: Jeff > Jess<br />
Gender: Male > Female<br />
Species: Human<br />
Breast size: None > GG<br />
Butt size: 24 inches > 41 inches <br />
Breed: American> African<br />
Age: 1 year 3 months<br />
<br />
And the rest Fifi decided to leave alone.<br />
&quot;Heh.&quot; She thought. &quot;I had asked mom for and African since I liked that color of human better, but I still love you boy.&quot; She laughed as she hit enter.<br />
<br />
She shook her head, laughing at how foolish she was being, but when she turned to look at Jeff, the changes had already happened. In Jeff&#39;s place, was an African female human. She had facial features similar to Jeff, but the rest was clearly different. <br />
<br />
She had massive human breasts, which Fifi always thought looked weird, since it was weird to just have two big ones instead of 8 small ones. She had curly black hair tied up in a spooky pompom ball on her head. She had an adorable pink collar and her legs were shorter while her butt was bouncy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Je-Jeff?&quot; Fifi asked amazed. &quot;Is that you boy?&quot; She asked again.<br />
<br />
The human just sat panting away, shaking her big butt slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right Fifi, it&#39;s a human. Uhhh, Jess? Hi Jess girl?&quot; She tried again, using her pet&#39;s new name.<br />
<br />
Jess barked, shaking her big butt before rolling over on her back, asking for a belly rub. Fifi managed to shake off the shock and give her a quick rub before Jess got distracted and started cleaning her pussy with strong licks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe it, it actually works!&quot; She laughed out loud. &quot;I can alter reality itself with this!&quot; She thought amazed. She was also incredibly turned on. <br />
<br />
Fifi was a closeted Skinny, and she loved to occasionally act like a human from time to time. The whole idea turned her on completely. Being nothing but a simple minded human had its perks, and she always wanted to know what it was like.<br />
&quot;I wonder, what would it be like if Humans ran the world instead of dogs?&quot; She asked herself. &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to transform or look like a human... but what if our roles were reversed?&quot; She asked Jess who was still licking herself.<br />
<br />
Fifi turned back towards the computer, and began to type some things in. After a bit of remodeling, she finally had it set so their roles would reverse. She changed the role of dogs to act as domesticated humans, and humans to act as intelligent dogs. <br />
<br />
The results of this would make Humans walk bipedal and have thumbs, while also wearing clothes and being able to speak. Dogs would lose their ability to speak and make rational decisions. They&#39;d have their skeletons alter so they are only capable of walking on all fours, while being completely naked. Everything else, like how dogs look (for the most part) and the names of each species will stay the same. Everything but the roles both species take.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok good.&quot; She thought looking over her changes. &quot;That should do it.&quot; She smiled, completely aroused by the idea as she hit the button.<br />
<br />
__________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Jess snapped awake, with admittedly a bit of a headache. She groaned, and sat up from her bed. What had she done last night? She didn&#39;t remember drinking or anything. Suddenly the slobber of a dog&#39;s tongue began to lick her face and she couldn&#39;t help but laugh as she pushed her dog Fifi off her.<br />
&quot;Down girl!&quot; She laughed. Her dog always made her smile, but something still was bugging her. <br />
<br />
She got up and walked towards the bathroom. As she sat to pee, she couldn&#39;t help but shake the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. She walked past the mirror and noted a few things. She definitely needed to get her crazy afro under control, and she needed bras that could support her massive girls without snapping every couple months as she removed a busted bra. <br />
<br />
After getting changed into a cute dress, she sat down at her computer to start writing, when she noticed an odd program in the corner of her desktop? <br />
<br />
<br />

Fernando snapped awake, with admittedly a bit of a headache. He groaned, and sat up from his bed. What had he done last night? He didn&#39;t remember drinking or anything. Suddenly the slobber of a human&#39;s tongue began to lick his face and he couldn&#39;t help but laugh as he pushed his human Jess off of him.<br />
<br />
He walked into the bathroom and started to rinse his eyes up. Why was something bugging him? He looked himself over but everything seemed fine. He was a a typical 26 year old male Chihuahua, studying for his degree, and he was in his house with his dog Jess the African Human. So, why did he feel something was off. <br />
<br />
Course later, he discovered the Chronivac,and had thought about changing things when he noticed a little menu pop up. It read &quot;TOO MANY REPEAT CHANGES BACK TO BACK: COMMENCE SOLUTION.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mea-&quot; He began before a light engulfed him and his human Jess.<br />
<br />
Reality was set back to it&#39;s original setting, but to avoid the feedback loop Fifi and Jeff caused, they were changed to avoid the issue. <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Thank you for house sitting again Jasmine, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re almost 16 now!&quot; Sherry said to the young lady who was picking up her purse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, no problem Miss Martin.&quot; Jasmine laughed. &quot;My momma didn&#39;t raise no slacker.&quot; She pridefully giggled, fluffing up her afro. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thanks again honey, and say hi Fiona for me!&quot; Sherry laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, Ima tell my momma you says hi!&quot; Jasmine laughed before she walked outside.<br />
<br />
Sherry waved by to the young lady, unaware that this girl had ever been her son. In her mind, she only had a single daughter, and that&#39;s the way it had always been. She shut the door behind her and kissed her husband Bill. <br />
&quot;Oh Bill, that vacation was so wonderful I&#39;m almost afraid to be home!&quot; She joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh trust me Sherry I get it, I have no desire to go back to work.&quot; Bill sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry dear, you can handle it. I didn&#39;t marry a quitter! Now, Megan is at soccer practice, and you&#39;ve got work to do. How about I play a game of solitaire, and you finish your work quick so we can mix some fun into this night before Megan comes home?&quot; She teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you women with your plans.&quot; Bill teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it you!&quot; Sherry teased back with a fake arm punch. &quot;Or you get none of this!&quot; She gestured before walking upstairs to the office that was once Jeff&#39;s room. <br />
<br />
Before she started, however, she noticed an odd program where her solitaire icon should be.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a Chron, Chrono.... what?&quot; She asked herself. <br />
<br />
She clicked it, and became amazed by what it promised. It said it could change the entire world, alter anything to your heart&#39;s desires and make it even so that only you could notice. She nearly laughed aloud, it sounded to good to be true. Still, her curiosity ate at her and she wondered around till she reached a &quot;change the world&quot; section. <br />
<br />
This area promised to make grand changes to everything, and even provided her a couple of base options. She looked at all of them and everyone of them sounded fun... if it was real. <br />
&quot;Oh, what&#39;s the harm?&quot; She thought to herself.<br />
<br />
She selected her awareness to on, and then clicked one of the presets. Before she knew it reality almost instantly started to change around her. The question is, what preset did she choose?</p>
