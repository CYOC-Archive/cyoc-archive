<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Today was the day. The day that James was going to get a new daddy. He sat in a chair in the bride’s room. He <br />
was happily kicking his feet while his mother was being fussed over. James looked at his mother and then at <br />
the table beside him. Sitting on a pale pink pillow were the two rings he was suppose to carry down the aisle. <br />
The groom’s ring was a simple silver ring with set of Celtic carvings. While the bride’s ring was silver with <br />
a pink opal and small diamonds. It was slender and elegant. James mischievously grinned as he swiped his <br />
mother’s ring. He slipped it into his pocket and quickly exited the room. <br />
<br />
He trotted to the men’s room as his little legs could carry him. Once inside the room, he looked in the stalls <br />
to make sure he was alone in the room. James nodded to himself after confirming. He once again trotted about <br />
until he stood in front of the sinks. It was hard, but he had managed to climb up to sit on the counter. He <br />
turned away from the mirror and sat with his legs hanging off the ledge. James stuck his hand in his pocket to <br />
retrieve the ring; his tongue worming its way between his lips. His blue eyes widened and his lips spread as <br />
he finally found the little treasure. He pulled it out; the stones glistening in the florescent lights over <br />
head. <br />
<br />
James grinned as his slipped the ring onto his ring finger. It was rather large for his finger so he clenched <br />
his fingers close together to hold it in place. He held his hand up to get a better look at the ring. James <br />
blinked a few times as he watched his tiny hand grow. His fingers became fatter; making it almost impossible <br />
to remove the ring. His arms grew in length and width as he watched the ceiling become closer. His clothes <br />
became tighter as his whole body grew. His felt a burning between his legs as he felt his penis grow. James <br />
didn’t have to know that his voice had deepened. He heard his tiny suit split down the spine as his size <br />
became too much for the child suit. He groaned; it was the only suit he had. <br />
<br />
James didn’t have time to worry about the suit because he felt his face rearrange itself. He crossed his eyes <br />
in time to watch his nose shrink. He could feel his lips begin to puff out. James watched as his tiny suit <br />
started to change. He watched the jacket melt from black to white. His pants began to lengthen as well as <br />
change color. The seams inside the now floor length pants started to sew themselves together before splitting. <br />
James continued to watch in horror as the once torn suit became a simple white dress. The long sleeves now <br />
thin straps resting on his shoulder. The high collar now inches below his clavicle. The skirt started to bunch <br />
itself together into a small bow next to his right knee. <br />
<br />
James was about to tear the ring from his finger, finally figuring out that the ring was the culprit, when he <br />
felt his cock harden. He moaned; having for the first time feeling needy. He bunched the skirt up to his hips <br />
before cautiously wrapping his hand around his thickened shaft. James moaned as he found another new feeling. <br />
His thinning hands worked as fast as they could on the shrinking member. Soon the saluting member had slid <br />
completely into her new body. Jamie’s new thin fingers pushed past her newly soaking lips and started to <br />
thrust. <br />
<br />
As Jamie finally reached her climax, her waist had become slender; allowing the dress to hug her newly forming <br />
curves. Her hips widened as a bustle made the skirt wider than it had been. There was something pressing <br />
against her chest, right beneath her nipples. Jamie turned towards the mirror as her breasts pressed against <br />
her dress top. They continued to press outwards until they were perky C-cups. The dress’s top cinched between <br />
her breasts as lace worked over the edge. Jamie’s shoes made her grow an inch or two as her socks crawled up <br />
her legs. Jamie looked down at her arms to watch a pair of gloves slide up her arms only to stop just above <br />
her elbows.<br />
 <br />
Jamie looked into the mirror as her scalp began to burn. Her once sandy blonde hair turned dark brow as it <br />
grew. It grew to the top of her breasts; causing the length to crawl up to her shoulders. Her lids became <br />
covered in a thin layer of pale pink while a faint blush clouded her cheeks. Her eyelashes became dark and <br />
longer as her plump lips coated themselves in a peach gloss. Jamie blinked again as ropes of necklaces wrapped <br />
around her pale neck. She blinked at the reflection in the mirror. <br />
               “Mom?” she whispered, gingerly touching the mirror. When she found out that the reflection in <br />
the mirror was herself, Jamie quickly withdrew her hand. <br />
She didn’t have time to freak out because there was a loud knock on the door. She spun around and pressed her <br />
perky ass into the counter.<br />
            “Jamie? You in there? You can’t be having nerves already.” The voice whined. Jamie remained quiet; <br />
hoping they would go away. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. She mumbled quietly as the large brown door <br />
pushed open. A smiling face poked itself in and looked around as if Jamie wasn’t standing in plain sight. Her <br />
overly painted green eyes widened when she finally spotted the terrified girl.<br />
           “There you are. It’s almost time to walk down the aisle.” She grinned. She walked into the restroom <br />
and took Jamie by the gloved hand. The woman guided Jamie back to the room where she had left her mother not <br />
even two hours ago. She shoved the poor girl into the chair that her mother was previous was sitting in and <br />
was busying about looking for the veil. <br />
<br />
Jamie whipped her head back and forth; looking for her mother. When the woman came back, she righted Jamie’s <br />
head and placing the veil on her dark curls. Once the long, silk veil was draped and pinned to her head, Jamie <br />
felt a major migraine start just behind her eyes. The few memories of playing with trucks and in sandboxes <br />
changed to years of high school and a few years of college. The many faces of children in parks and on <br />
playgrounds turned into dates and slumber parties. Every single memory that had once occupied the young boy’s <br />
head was now gone and replaced with memories, hopes, and dreams of a grown woman. <br />
<br />
Jamie blinked a few more times before looking at herself in the mirror. She tilted her head slightly as she <br />
pouted. Her blue eyes searched the makeup covered table in front of her until she found a tube of lip gloss. <br />
She untwisted the wand out before applying a different shade of lip gloss to her lips. This color was more <br />
reddish-pink than peach. Jamie screwed the wand back into the tube before giving herself a nod. <br />
             “Alright. Let’s go.” She grinned before standing up. Jamie grabbed a bouquet of Oriental <br />
Stargazer Lilies and Baby’s Breath flowers before leaving the room. She hurried over to the closed doors <br />
behind a herd of crazed bride’s maids and groom’s men. The flower girl was leaning against the wall; having <br />
already lost all interest in the job she was assigned. Jamie grinned as everyone rearranged themselves and the <br />
doors swung open. Today was the day, her new life began. In more ways than she ever knew.</p>
