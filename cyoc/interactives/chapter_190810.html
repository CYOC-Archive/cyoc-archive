<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But suffocating in the belly of a microbe was not June’s fate.<br />
<br />
The next thing she knew, she was surging bigger. She grew with such force that the germ around her burst in horrific fashion, splattering over the glass surface. She gasped in air, falling to her hands and knees on the glass slide, and retched violently as she outgrew the slime and digestive enzymes coating her lungs and airway. She managed to sit up, dizzy, and realized the other germ was now small enough to be crushed underfoot.<br />
<br />
With righteous vengeance, June stood up, a rush of adrenaline flooding her, screamed, and slammed her foot down on the other germ. It splattered like a wet dot under her foot.<br />
<br />
She looked up and saw the glinting magnifier above her flash. It was growing closer and closer to her head. She gasped and ducked, filling the slide and slipping off.<br />
<br />
The next thing she knew, she was back in Ty’s palm and holding her size. An inch or two tall once more. She laid back in shock, reeking of ozone and acidity, and went wide eyed. She processed her near death. She saw Ty staring down at her. She felt huge and safe and warm lying in his fleshy palm once more. She coughed reflexively and remembered the feeling of the germ sucking her in. Her utter helplessness. The weight of it around her. The slosh of it. The feeling of her imminent death. The sinking of infinite shrinking.<br />
<br />
Ty leaned in, staring in wonder, and saw the red broken blood vessels around her eyes from crying so hard. She looked up at him weakly, not daring to move, not daring to speak, and whimpered slightly, at least audible to the giant again.<br />
<br />
“Now...” Ty whispered, oh so gently as not to hurt her little ears. “I hope you understand that I’m not fucking around.”<br />
<br />
“I-I understand.” June whispered softly, her voice high pitched and squeaky again, but clear.<br />
<br />
“Good.” Ty whispered back, nodding. “I also hope you understand the pain and horror I can inflict on you now.”<br />
<br />
“I understand.” June replied, shaking in fresh hot terror in his palm.<br />
<br />
“There are worse fates than being digested by a microbe, June.” Ty began, savouring the sense of complete and utter control he now had. “So whenever you feel like I’m being unfair or cruel, I want you to remember this lesson.”<br />
<br />
“Y-Yes, Ty.” June squeaked, nodding solemnly.<br />
<br />
“Yes, what?” Ty insisted, grinning deviously.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Master.” June quickly corrected, going wide eyed but not daring to move. She was spread eagle on his palm, trembling.<br />
<br />
“There’s my good little girl.” Ty smiled back warmly, gently rolling her to his desktop next to the microscope. “I promise I’ll never do that to you again as long as we have an understanding about... what I am capable of.”<br />
<br />
June sat up, staring in horror at the microscope that still loomed two stories over her head from top to bottom, and looked back to Ty. She was grateful to be alive and thoroughly educated as to his intentions with her. She nodded quietly, agreeing.<br />
<br />
“How did it feel?” Ty whispered down, leaning in excitedly. “To shrink so far? So small? To be such an impossible size. To feel yourself going down further and further forever without anything to stop it.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve never felt so utterly alone and helpless in all my life.” June admitted, gulping and pulling her legs up to sit on her knees before her new Lord and Master.<br />
<br />
“Did it excite you?” Ty grinned. “Even a little? As you shrank into nothingness?”<br />
<br />
“A little.” She gulped. “I couldn’t... e-enjoy it.”<br />
<br />
“No, I bet you couldn’t.” Ty grinned from ear to ear. “But now you have a sense of scale. Of perspective. Of what it means to truly and completely be nothing. I watched it eat you through that lens. I’m still rock hard.”<br />
<br />
June began to quiver and nodded, closing her eyes and fighting off the nightmarish experience as she sat next to the microscope in physical and emotional exhaustion. She opened her eyes and looked over at the glass plate she had nearly died on, still lit by the bulb underneath it. Yes, she understood. This had just been a taste of what was in store for her.<br />
<br />
“D-Did I do a good job on the yard?” She asked suddenly, voice breaking in suddenly vulnerability. “I-I really tried. D-Did I make you unhappy with me?”<br />
<br />
“No.” Ty smirked. “You did great. I especially liked watching your little shrinking naked body work so hard. That hot sweat drenching you, rolling down your flesh. I had no idea you could be so strong. So focused. It was a huge turn on.”<br />
<br />
Ty reached out with one finger and brushed the tip of it over June’s tiny shoulder. She smiled weakly and blushed red.<br />
<br />
“B-Before Mark I used to be a really confident woman. I worked out all the time. I was lean, firm, and good looking.”<br />
<br />
“Mmm.” Ty smiled. “Did you have muscle?”<br />
<br />
June went wide eyed and looked up, blinking. “I mean, I was tight. But never bulky, you know? Like just definition.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm. I’ll keep that in mind. I might like a big buff step mom. Maybe I should steadily firm you and strengthen you until you can fucking kick Mark’s ass. Beat him the fuck down. How does that sound, little lady?”<br />
<br />
June gulped and blushed harder. “Really... really good.”<br />
<br />
She sat on his desktop and shifted as the wood grain began to dent her knees. She sat back on her middle aged ass and let out a sigh.<br />
<br />
“Why did you...” She paused, wincing.<br />
<br />
“No, ask.” Ty shrugged. “I don’t actually want to hurt you.”<br />
<br />
“W-Why did you almost let me die? If I turn you on that much? As... as a plaything.”<br />
<br />
Ty chuckled ominously. “To teach you a lesson, my cruel little bitch. Did you learn anything?”<br />
<br />
She looked up, crossed her arms over her tiny knees, rubbing them, and gulped. “What was I supposed to learn, T... er, Master?”<br />
<br />
“I wanted you to feel the fear and panic that I feel every day from the three of you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, no, no!” June stood up suddenly, gasping. “I did get that part! I totally got it! I’ve been... I’ve been fucking thinking about it since you left me alone.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” Ty chuckled again. “Just that was enough to make you think twice?”<br />
<br />
“T-Ty! Honey!” She gasped. “You... you changed me in more ways than just... my size! I don’t think I can possibly go back to being such a fucking lousy human again.” She paused and blinked, looking suddenly terrified. “W-What about... what about the other two? Are you going to punish them too?”<br />
<br />
“Without a doubt.” Ty grinned. “But... I think I’ll like punishing you the most, little step mom.”<br />
<br />
June blushed deep red and looked away with a genuine smile. “Yeah? You like me?”<br />
<br />
“Can I fuck you?” Ty grinned excitedly, leaning in. June felt the hot quick breath on her whole form.<br />
<br />
“Mmm,” June moaned, squeezing her legs together and bouncing a little. “I couldn’t say no to you, could I?”<br />
<br />
“Can I make you big? Like huge?”<br />
<br />
“Mmm,” she moaned again, nodding. “Like a giant? Think of how big my tits would be.”<br />
<br />
“Now we’re talking.” Ty blushed hot red. “You like that I can do whatever I want to you, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
“I... I do.” She gulped, squirming. “I’m totally helpless. And you’re so fucked up. Just like... me.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah... I didn’t see that coming, you sick little bitch.” Ty gulped. “I didn’t expect that at all.”<br />
<br />
“So...” June trailed off, shaking with lust and excitement instead of fear. “Let’s play! I want to be your toy. I want to be owned by you, completely. Do whatever the fuck you want  to me, Ty. Master. Whatever you want me to call you. The weirder the better.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?” Ty blushed harder.<br />
<br />
“Yeah!” June leapt forward excitedly, hands behind her back, her nipples visibly hard even at her two inch height. “Just... don’t kill me again. It’d be such a fucking waste of a little naughty partner in crime.”<br />
<br />
“Agreed.” Ty nodded, and held out his hand. “Now promise me you won’t ever make my life hell again.”<br />
<br />
June nodded firmly, formally, and extended her own tiny hand, gripping his index finger and shaking it up and down. “Deal.”<br />
<br />
They both backed away and stared at each other in shock. Surprise. Delight, even.<br />
<br />
“So, you’re into shrinking. I think we probably have the same websites.” Ty grinned. “How come?”<br />
<br />
“Mmm.” June grinned, holding his finger and leaning forward to kiss it gently. “I mean, I’ve always been a big freak. I wanted to stay little. Be a short cute little woman. Instead I shot up into a big six foot rail. And men don’t usually go for tall girls. So, you know, the idea of being small turned me on. Having a huge man put me down on the bed and fuck me raw.”<br />
<br />
“That sounds nice.” Ty giggled, scooping up tiny June in his hand and closing his fingers around her. To his shock, he heard her moan excitedly and felt her grinding herself against his giant fingers.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Yes!” She  gasped, squeaking excitedly. “Fucking use me, Ty! Abuse me! I don’t fucking care. Make yourself feel good.”<br />
<br />
“You said it.” Ty shrugged. He urged her to grow back to a doll. June grunted as growth pressed her out and up and she pressed against Ty’s still firm fingers. He squeezed her the entire way up, pressing down on her tits and torso as she expanded in his grip.<br />
<br />
A twelve inch doll squirmed in his hand, kicking her long legs and moaning. He could feel the heat from her pussy under his pinky. The dampness between her thighs.<br />
<br />
“Little horny size changing slut.” Ty teased. This made June squirm harder. He nipples were hopelessly erect, pressing into his index finger as her breasts were squished under it.<br />
<br />
“Oh, fuck yes!” June gasped. “I am! I am! I’m your little growing shrinking slut.”<br />
<br />
“What else do you like, step mommy?” Ty grinned, carrying her new toy over to the bed and dropping her on the sheets. June bounced on the springs lightly and sprawled out, her long brunette hair falling over her face. She looked up and blushed deeper red as Ty loomed over her, staring down.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm. Well, being fucking dommed obviously.” She giggled nervously. “Big men. Big cocks. Being roughed up. Hurt a little. Pain. Torture. Bondage. I don’t know, like, fucking S&M shit.”<br />
<br />
“Kinky little bitch, aren’t you?” Ty watched her tiny eyes widen as he dropped his pants and she saw the enormous bulge in his underwear snap up.<br />
<br />
“Fucking Christ.” She stared in wonder. Her breathing started to grow heavier. Ty sat on the edge of the bed next to his tiny doll and pet her back gently. She began to shake again.<br />
<br />
“So the idea of me warping you... changing you. Making you something else entirely. Would that hit the buttons?”<br />
<br />
“Am I totally fucking helpless and unable to resist?” June looked up with a hot blush over her face, neck, and tits. “Are you forcing me into whatever the fuck you want me to be?”<br />
<br />
“Of course I am.” Ty grinned, booping her nose.<br />
<br />
June shrugged. “Then do what you will, you big freak. I’m right there with you.” She paused and looked up, smiling broadly as Ty reached around and squeezed her tits together between his fingers. “What do you like? I can be a better toy if I know what you’re into.”<br />
<br />
Ty shrugged. “Power. Control.”<br />
<br />
“Fair enough.” June nodded. “I’m sure I know why.”<br />
<br />
“Same reason you were into it, I’d wager.”<br />
<br />
“Lack of control.” June sighed. She eyed Ty’s bobbing bulge excitedly.<br />
<br />
“And... transformation.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?” June perked up, touching her tiny hand to Ty’s bare thigh and pulling herself closer.<br />
<br />
“I want to do all kinds of crazy shit to you. Bigger. Smaller. Thinner. Fatter. Tall. Short. Different fucking species.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa, fuck!” Her eyes bugged out. “You mean, like... make me... not a human being?”<br />
<br />
“Exactly.”<br />
<br />
“Fucking hell. That’s so weird.” She giggled meekly and held her hands over her mouth in perverted shock. “You mean... like... like... animals?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Ty nodded, blushing.<br />
<br />
“Are you a fucking furry?” June gasped, remembering the word. She was obviously excited.<br />
<br />
“Mmmmhmmm.” Ty looked away, mortified.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me!” June slapped his thigh. “No, I’m down. I’m fucking down, buddy! Fur me up if you want.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm.” Ty glanced down, deviously. “This turned out to be quite a good birthday after all, didn’t it?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, fuck!” June gaped. “Is it your birthday?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Ty deadpanned, going stone faced.<br />
<br />
“Shit!” June recoiled. “I had no idea! I...” She sighed. Better be honest. He’d know. “I didn’t ever fucking care.”<br />
<br />
“I know.” Ty leaned over slightly, patting her head. “But things have changed.”<br />
<br />
June gulped. Ty began to move on the bed next to her.<br />
<br />
“Now!” Ty grinned excitedly. “You’re gonna fucking make it up to me, my little bitch.”<br />
<br />
June let out a squeal as Ty grabbed her by the waist and rolled over onto his bed, spreading his legs beneath him and almost but not quite licking his lips with anticipation. June flailed in the air, dangling by his hand as he swished her through the air and plopped her down on his crotch.<br />
<br />
June stared in awe. She felt the contours of a giant cock throbbing between her legs. She smelt the hot sweat of arousal and the tangy scent of precum with a closeness she had never imagined. She felt pulsations of veins and blood beneath her thighs.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God.” She blinked.<br />
<br />
“Get to work.” Ty commanded. “I want my underwear off and I want to be pleasured by you, doll.”<br />
<br />
“Y-Yes...” June gulped in utter delight as she frantically scooted back and grabbed at the waistband of his underwear.<br />
<br />
“Yes, WHAT, little doll?” Ty pointedly pressed his finger into her back and pushed down her spine, bending her. She felt herself grow wetter and hotter, were that possible.<br />
<br />
“Y-Yes, Master.” June moaned.</p>
