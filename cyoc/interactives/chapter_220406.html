<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two weeks later <br />
<br />
Alice groaned as her alarm now blared in her room. Groggily reaching over, she now turned it off before stretching. Slowly she now made her way to the bathroom, pausing as she gazed at her reflection. How had she let this go so far.<br />
<br />
Staring back at Alice was an ebony haired 16 year old. Alice&#39;s face was round, her eyes wide an innocent. The teens body was fit, sporting a pair of perky B cups with a flat tummy. As she now gazed at her legs, she noted how much thinner they were than only a few days ago. Brushing her hair behind her ears, Alice noted how it had grown out slightly with her last few rolls, now resting on her upper back.<br />
<br />
It seemed unbelievable to see herself as a teenager once more. A week ago she had been a woman in her mid twenties, surrounded by three friends around the same age. All of them had been ecstatic about regaining their youth, celebrating into the night. Alice even recalled how all four of them managed to find a mam that evening. Alice blushed at the thought, remembering returning with the young man to his home before making love until the sun came up. Then, things began to spiral.<br />
<br />
Alice wasn&#39;t sure how, the four if them had been milling about Alice&#39;s bookstore. Lena and Sharon stopped by, talking excitedly about their days when Alice and Lena began to become anxious. Simply talking with Sharon and Nicole had made the 24 and 25 year old feel old. They both admitted loving the sensation of growing younger, the dice had an almost intoxicating affect as it removed years. Maybe, just one more throw, if only to be the same age as their friends. That was how it started, Alice and Lena going from 25 and 24 to only 22. The loss of those years giving them a high and a revitalizing sensation that was impossible to put into words. Regrettably it wouldn&#39;t stop there.<br />
<br />
Soon enough Nicole would roll, becoming 22 as well. From there they felt that this was young enough, but the feeling wouldn&#39;t last. Yes 22 was great but why not be 21. Alice realized afterwards that the women were addicted to the effects of the dice.<br />
<br />
Soon 21 wasn&#39;t young enough, the idea of trying to sneak into the bar sounded exciting. The next thing Alice knew the women were 20 and shortly thereafter 19. Alice recalled how enthralled she had been seeing her teenage appearances. Flawless skin, firm breasts, a flat stomach, and luxurious healthy hair. With each lost year Alice and the others felt better and better. They wanted more.<br />
<br />
Soon being college age seemed boring, the four coeds craving the loss of additional years. It started innocently enough, after Lena, Sharon, and Nicole had moved into Alice&#39;s home. The reason behind the move was a desire to not only be together but to roll the dice together. To them it made sense, especially when Alice closed the bookstore for two weeks and Sharon decided to take some needed vacation time. Alice and the others had simply been enjoying some pizza when the thought of going back to high school got stuck in their head. Being 18 sounded phenomenal.<br />
<br />
Alice should have known then that this was going too far. The girls bodies slimmed incredibly, their curves melting away as their faces became even more youthful. They looked like they were ready for prom as they all became 18. Still, the draw of the dice was overpowering, why be 18 and graduate from high school when you could be 17 and still enjoy one more year.<br />
<br />
Soon enough 17 wasn&#39;t good enough anymore, everybody wanted to be 16 right?  As the group became 16, Alice had a sobering moment. Enjoying her new found youth, Alice got thw crazy idea to try on her wedding dress. Pulling it out of a dusty box, she had tried it on along with her wedding ring and gasped in shock.<br />
<br />
She had gotten married at 20, she remembered the dress hugging and accentuating her every curve. Now at 16 she was shocked to see the dress hanging on her slight teenage frame, even worse was when the wedding ring she had not worn in 10 years slipped from her finger. It was at that moment, staring at the ebony haired teenage girl in an ill fitting dress that she realized she had taken it too far.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Alice, her friends had yet to have this sobering realization. Soon enough Sharon and Nicole had rolled themselves back to 15 before becoming 14. Lena had tried to hold out, Alice seeming to talk her into remaining 16 last night if for no other reason than to have two people old enough to drive. As Alice now walked downstairs she frowned as she gazed at Lena. &quot;Did you roll the dice again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lena giggled, throwing her fire red hair back as she smiled at Alice. Now only 14 like Sharon and Nicole, the young teen possessed a round, innocent face, wafiah body, and small B cup breasts. The young teen fidgeting with her tshirt and sweat shorts that had fit her perfectly last night. &quot;Just a little Ali,&quot; she smiled, her voice much higher than just a few days ago. &quot;Like you should relax. I&#39;m 14, I&#39;ll be old enough for high school soon enough. Besides, Sharon came up with the coolest idea. We should try out for cheerleading, can you imagine being cheerleaders all through high school?&quot; Alice said nothing, watching as the waifish red head now bounded barefoot into the backyard. Alice noting a 14 year old Nicole and Sharon waiting for her. The blond and brunette teens were now just as skinny as their red haired friend and dressed in shorts and tshirts.<br />
<br />
Alice sighed, taking a seat as she now watched the young teens practice tumbling in her backyard. They were so engrossed in their fun that they failed to notice just how young they appeared or how young they were acting. What was worse for Alice was the growing desire to roll the dice and join the trio. Being 14 and a cheerleader sounded like so much fun.<br />
<br />
Alice now tried to shake the thought from her head as she gazed at the dice. Restart road wasn&#39;t far away, perhaps only a 15 minute car ride. If she took the dice back, maybe she could stop it reverse this before all of then rolled themselves into non existence. All Alice knew though was that she needed to fight this addiction to dice rolling before it was too late for all of them.</p>
