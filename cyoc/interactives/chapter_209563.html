<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dylan felt itching to get back into the game. He wanted to be that big powerful minotaur again, but mundane life logistics kept getting in the way. He quickly loaded up the washing machine, starting a load before retreating to his bedroom.<br />
<br />
He was halfway to putting his VR headset on when he realized Mike had the right idea. He went and got some fresh towels to lay out on his desk chair and the floor space underneath. He was about to log in, when he realized Mike probably needed a fresh towel of his own. You know, in case the satyr climaxed again while in the game.<br />
<br />
Or rather, when he climaxed in the game again.<br />
<br />
Dylan was halfway through laying down another towel when he heard a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well well well, what do we have here?&quot; Mike&#39;s slightly-bleating accent whispered.<br />
<br />
Dylan shot up with a start. He glanced over at Mike, but realized he was still laying back in his chair. The voice had come out Mike&#39;s computer monitor, not him. Glancing up at the display, Dylan could see that Mike had stirred from his rest. The satyr had sat up in the tree, watching a lone human adventurer lurk through his training ground. <br />
<br />
What was a rogue doing traveling on his own like that? The scrawny little thing wasn&#39;t going to know what hit him.<br />
<br />
Alright, now it was time to get logged in. With any luck Dylan could get into the game fast enough to enjoy the show in person. He got up from his friend&#39;s desk, headed for the door-<br />
<br />
And then his phone rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh...&quot; Dylan rolled his eyes. He quickly ran into the living room to grab his cell phone. His boss&#39;s name popped up on his caller ID. Just great. He couldn&#39;t let that go to voicemail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dude, I mean sir. What&#39;s up?&quot; Dylan tapped the answer button as he walked back into Mike&#39;s room. If he was going to be stuck on the phone, Dylan was at least going to enjoy the show from the satyr&#39;s point of view.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m still out. Can&#39;t put a ton of weight onto it yet.&quot; Dylan reached out, muting Mike&#39;s monitor.<br />
<br />
It was just in time too. Mike and the rogue started to fight, and the satyr&#39;s training had clearly paid off. He quickly disarmed the thief, and managed to get him into one of those grapple positions he had seen Mike practice earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...? No, start on the next site without me...&quot; Dylan was only half paying attention to his boss. It was suddenly clear why Mike had practiced this particular stance. He had shoved down the human&#39;s pants, and it wasn&#39;t long before his satyrhood had found its mark.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t surprising to see that Mike was excited again in the game, but Dylan was a little impressed to see Mike&#39;s real cock bobbing up and down in the air again. Good thing he had gotten him a fresh towel.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should be good in... about a week? Maybe a week and a half.&quot; Dylan watched the monitor. This was a really fun point of view to watch a new monster being made. The rogue&#39;s skin was turning green, and those were some unmistakably pointy goblin ears. The two started to move together as one, the rogue&#39;s now-oversized clothes falling to the wayside.<br />
<br />
A soft moan filled the air. Shit shit shit...! Dylan reached down to mute the monitor, when he remembered he already had. The sound was coming from Mike himself!<br />
<br />
Dylan quickly covered up his phone&#39;s microphone. &quot;Sorry, roommate left the TV on.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stared down at his friend. Mike was flush again, with a bit of pre dripping down his shaft. His body reflexively humped the air in time with the thrusts on the monitor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah...!&quot; Mike let out a soft bleat as he tried to bring himself to climax again. He&#39;d shot his load only moments ago, so it was clearly taking a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, uh, nature documentary.&quot; Dylan mumbled into his phone. Wait- Mike just bleated?<br />
<br />
Dylan looked down at his friend. It was fun seeing him all pent up like this, but something was off. He curiously traced his finger down Mike&#39;s face, gently teasing a wisp of scruffy hair on his chin.<br />
<br />
The phone in his ear protested. &quot;I&#39;m listening. Workman&#39;s comp is about to run out, I know man.&quot; Dylan reached up, brushing Mike&#39;s hair aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah, baah, baah...&quot; Mike began to pant as the two monsters earnestly started going at it in the game.<br />
<br />
Dylan stared. The two bumps on Mike&#39;s head weren&#39;t just bumps anymore. Two small horns had pushed their way out of his roommate&#39;s head. They were immediately familiar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll try doing some stretches- Uh, hold on a sec...!&quot; Dylan&#39;s eyes went wide. He tried propping the phone on his shoulder so he could better pull back his friend&#39;s hair. Those had to be part of the headset or something, right? Maybe preorder bonus or-<br />
<br />
A squirt of pre landed on Dylan&#39;s arm as he tried to get a better look. He reflexively leaned back, taking a look down at Mike&#39;s crotch. He was clearly getting close, but something else had caught Dylan&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
With each thrust, the hair on Mike&#39;s legs got thicker. It was concentrated on the lower part of his legs, and was getting so thick it could scarcely be called hair anymore. Mike was growing a coat of honest to goodness goat fur on the bottom of his legs.<br />
<br />
Another stream of pre shot out and landed on Mike&#39;s chest. The nails on his toes were starting to darken now. The phone against his ear was shouting something, but Dylan had tuned it out completely at this point. Right before his eyes, Mike&#39;s feet were beginning to shift.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baaaaah...!&quot; Mike moaned softly, clearly finding the release he was looking for. His cock erupted in another torrent of cum, coating his chest and soaking the towels on the floor around him. At the base of his legs, the nails on his toes fused together into a pair of glossy black cloven hooves.<br />
<br />
Up on the display, Mike and the new goblin uncoupled. The satyr rolled over and propped himself contently up against a tree as the new monster ran off into the woods. He basked in his afterglow for a moment before starting to rummage through the former rogue&#39;s belongings for loot.<br />
<br />
Mike was just continuing to play the game. This was surreal. He seemed completely oblivious to the changes to his real world body. Mike had goat legs from the knees down, and his face was framed with the horns of, well, a satyr.<br />
<br />
Dylan looked down in disbelief. He picked up his phone, hovering over the end call button, &quot;You know what dude, I&#39;m going to have to call you back.&quot;</p>
