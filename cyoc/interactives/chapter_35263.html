<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a long grueling morning of sex, both Crystal and Travis got up and get ready for another long day.  After getting all dressed and having breakfast, Travis was about to leave the house and head off to work.  But before he does that, he kissed Crystal on the cheek and said to her, “Bye honey.  I’ll be home when my work shift is done.”  Crystal smiled at that, but move close to his ear and whispered to him.  “Don’t stay too long.  I don’t want to wait for tonight.”  Travis smirked and knew what she truly meant.  So he exited the house and entered his car, so that he can drive to and from work.  When he was gone, Crystal went back into the house and went to work in the house.<br />
<br />
For the past few hours, she was cleaning the rooms, vacuuming the rugs, tending to the flowers in both the front and back yard, and feeding the car, Tammy.  It was mid afternoon now and Tracey had token care of everything in the house.  So she decided to take a quick break and rest until she gets dinner ready.  She headed upstairs to the master bedroom, to see what she could find on the net.  When she turned on the computer, she noticed a program she had never seen before.  “Extreme Reality Game?” she asked herself, “What’s that?”  She tried to figure out what this game is all about.<br />
<br />
However, she didn’t know she already use the program before.  She was just a child when she used the program last night and thought it was just a game.  But when she used it to make herself older, she had the aware toggle off and forgot about the chaos she’d done.  As Crystal looked through the program, she wondered what it might be.  “This looks like one of them Sims games I’ve heard about.” she said as she looked at the character sitting on computer that had her name on it.  “But why does one of the characters have my name on it?  This is weird…”<br />
<br />
After starring at this game for a few good minutes, she decided to play with this game a little bit.  What harm can a video game cause?  She started clicking on the character with her name on it and a small pop up appeared next to it.  There were many options on the menu from age, size, animal, gender, just about anything.  She looked at all the options and was confused at all this.  “What’s all this?” she ask herself as she tried to figure out what this is about.  After looking at her options, she decided to click on the body icon on the menu.  When she clicked on it, there was another option menu that popped up after.  This wanted to know which type of the body and showed the many options on it.  Feeling a little annoyed about that, she skimmed through the options and clicked on the chest icon.  There, a drop down menu appeared and showed her more options, with the letter C on choice.  She clicked on the down arrow and saw a list that had the letters A-Z.  She thought it was a complete joke and said, “Man, whoever created the game have a sick sense of humor.”  She figures out the choices and decided to click on the letter D on the dropdown menu.  When she picked that, she clicked on the O.K. icon in order to start the process.  But before that could happen, one more pop up window appeared, saying if she wants her character to be aware of the changes.  “What’s this?” she said, getting completely tired on this multiple-choice options.  She moved the pointer left to right on both buttons that read ‘Aware’ and ‘Unaware’.  She came to the decision to pick the aware button to see what would happen to the character.  When she was finally finished, she watched the character starting to change.<br />
<br />
While she was watching, Crystal felt a little hot for some strange reason.  She decided to let that pass and watched the character on the screen having its breasts growing.  At the same time, her blue blouse felt completely tight.  She wondered if she got the wrong size or something.  She looked down to see what’s the matter with her blouse, only to find out something completely shocking.  What she saw was her breasts looking a little larger then before as her nipples were starting to form on the fabric.  She quickly got out of the computer and headed to the full-length mirror she normally uses to get dressed to see what was happening.  When she took a good look, she was surprised at the size of her chest.  It appears that the two boobs were growing at an alarming rate, passing C-cup status and approaching double Cs.  The online of her tits were widening through the blouse looked like half dollars.  Speaking of her blouse, it couldn’t hold the growing assets much longer as a tear came down the neckline and went down, making impressive cleavage for her rack.  Not only that, but her bra was getting dangerously tight as the back seems couldn’t hold the support for much longer.<br />
<br />
Crystal thought her blouse was going to blow up and reveals her huge bosom.  But once it started, it stopped as her upper part of her clothes was ripped from the top to middle.  She stared in amazement as her breasts have completely grown to a set of D-cups.  “Unbelievable…” she said with a hush but silent voice, “How did this happened?”<br />
<br />
When she was trying to figure all this out, she suddenly remembered making the character in the computer game’s breasts grow.  She hurried back to the computer with her boobs bouncing up and down and looked at the screen character she picked.  It had her name on the character and looked just life her from her appearance to the way she dresses.  Starring at that for a long time, she figured all this out and understood what this game really was.  “Oh my god, this Sims game!  It changes reality!!!” she screamed in delight.  She looked down at her breasts and started cupping them, feeling them move freely on her over tight bra and blouse.  “I can’t believe I made myself grow a nice pair of these jugs.” She then said, feeling the sexual pleasure of her remarkable assets.<br />
<br />
Then Crystal looked back up at the screen and thought how fun it would be to start playing around with reality, to see what would happen.  “Wonder what else I can do?” she asked herself as she sat back down and use the game.  There were many characters in and around the house and many options to choose from.  She moved her mouse around, pointing to each character and wondering who to choose from.</p>
