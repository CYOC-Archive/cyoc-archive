<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But Jeff didn´t lick away the peanut butter, instead he is still shaking his head.<br />
<br />
“You know you like it, boy. Or are you to give up this easily?” Lyle asked him again. As Jeff still didn´t moved over to him, he tried another thing. “You know, I can keep you as a dog, not that anyone would look for you. Is that what you want?”<br />
<br />
Jeff growled at him, but seeing how he had no real choice he slowly came nearer and finally started cleaning of the peanut butter from Lyle&#39;s cock. He wanted to gag and look disgusted, but all Lyle did was laughing at how cute it was.<br />
<br />
“You are good at that. Want another portion, boy?” Lyle asked still laughing. Jeff again shook his head. “You´re sure? Okay, then maybe later.” Lyle closed the jar and put it on the table next to the chronivac. “Give up yet, boy?” <br />
<br />
And again Jeff shook his head no. “Woof! Woof!”<br />
<br />
“Okay, then we should look for your leach. After all you will need to get outside soon to do your business, right?” Lyle asked him smirking.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes widened at that. But after a short pause he nodded, clearly seeing one thing positive. While he had to shit outside, Lyle had to collect it afterwards.<br />
<br />
After getting another pizza, and the happy deliverer got his bj, Lyle put the leach on Jeff&#39;s collar and they headed out. Jeff didn&#39;t´t want to move to far, so he let his droppings out the moment they were outside the building, much to the annoyance of Lyle.<br />
<br />
“You couldn´t keep it in a bit longer?” he asked as he had started to collect it in a plastic bag. <br />
<br />
Jeff took that moment to pull on the leach, and even with all his strength Lyle couldn´t stop himself from toppling over, hitting Jeff&#39;s shit on the way down with both hands.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Lyle was pissed by this. He held his hands out to Jeff. “Lick them clean, boy.”<br />
<br />
Jeff again shook his head. “Woof! Woof! Woof!” It sounded a bit like laughing.<br />
<br />
Lyle stood up and turned around, pulling Jeff right back inside. Luckily nobody had seen them. Inside he washed his hands for over two minutes to get all that smell away. Afterwards he returned to the still happy dog.<br />
<br />
“You know, I think I have to punish you in some way. Maybe going to get you fixed, boy. After all I´m not a breeder, so normally I must get you fixed.” Lyle said, sounding serious.<br />
<br />
Jeff whimpered at that, not believing Lyle would do that. After all he was no real dog.<br />
<br />
Then Lyle laughed at him. “As if I would get you fixed. But I will think of something other later, maybe after you give up.” <br />
<br />
Jeff didn´t think so. “Woof! Woof!”<br />
<br />
Lyle ate his pizza while Jeff looked hopefully, but Lyle didn´t share any with him. “Pizza isn´t for dogs. But when I´m finished I will look for dog food for you.” And so he did. He found a can of dog food and put it in Jeff&#39;s bowl, grinning. “There you are. Eat up, boy.”<br />
<br />
Jeff was disgusted again, but didn´t want to lose the bet, so he slowly started to eat. He couldn´t win the bet if he starved himself to death after all.<br />
<br />
While Jeff was eating, Lyle decided to abandon their bet. He had decided to keep Jeff a dog, but for that he would need to adjust some things first. And Jeff couldn´t stop him as long as he was distracted by the food.<br />
<br />
Looking over the program he quickly found something to change. The first was the level of obedience Jeff showed for his commands, and he put it up to the highest setting. He wouldn´t disobey him any longer. He also made Jeff loyaler to himself.<br />
<br />
A second change was that Jeff would be oblivious to any change made by the program, and wouldn´t suspect Lyle to have done anything. Jeff would still think everything was normal and they were still on the bet. He also added that Jeff would never give up on the bet, therefore would stay a dog on his own. More changes he could make later, if needed, so he saved it.<br />
<br />
Shortly after Jeff trotted over to him, having finished the dog food. “Some dessert, Jeff?” Lyle asked. As Jeff nodded his head, he took the jar of peanut butter again, opened it and dipped his cock in again. “Then lick my cock clean like you did before.”<br />
<br />
Like before Jeff shook his head no, but his body obeyed the command and moved over, and licked the cock clean without hesitation. “More?” Before Jeff could respond, he dipped his cock in again.<br />
<br />
That repeated three times before Lyle stopped, closing the jar again. “Delicious, right Jeff?”<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head no again. “Woof! Woof!”<br />
<br />
“Then why did you enjoy it that much?” Lyle asked grinning.<br />
<br />
“Woof? Woof?” Jeff barked slightly confused. He didn´t know why he enjoyed it, he was neither gay nor liked he peanut butter at all.<br />
<br />
“Well, give up yet? Otherwise I will go to bed, I´m tired.” Lyle said. <br />
<br />
Jeff clearly showed he wouldn´t give up. So they moved to Lyle&#39;s bed. <br />
<br />
As Jeff tried to jump up, Lyle said: “Down boy. You are sleeping on the floor next to my bed. You aren´t allowed on any furniture as a dog.”<br />
<br />
Jeff barked in protest, but laid down on the spot Lyle pointed at, whimpering as it was cold and uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
“Night Jeff.” Lyle said as he laid under the covers grinning. He liked that change.</p>
