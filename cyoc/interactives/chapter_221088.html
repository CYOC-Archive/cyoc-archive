<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting in my new room playing the game, and thinking of the last two weeks and thinking how i saw my self and thort, I only thought myself as David now... for the most part. I just found it easier to do so, and all my “new” friends call me that, and even... well actually, everyone does exsept of the real David. <br />
<br />
He still sees me as Brad, and I still call him David when it&#39;s just the two of us. It makes him happy and I feel like I&#39;m being the cool big brother for him. <br />
<br />
But god, I never realized how annoying I once was with David&#39;s constant talking and questions when I am with him. He always wants me to play with him all the time. There was a point where I had to lift him and carry him out of my room, telling him that he can&#39;t be in my room without me allowing him to be, but I felt bad I was the only one trying to spend time with him, with mom and dad and are brother and sisters just treating him like how they treated me, when I was in that body, with them Ignoring him. <br />
<br />
I now understand why he did the same thing a lot of the time to, me when I was in that small body, but I also feel bad for him. for having all this knowledge now and David doesn&#39;t promptly have all his Knowledge, despite him claiming he does. I tested him without him knowing, and he gets most of it wrong. I just feel like a thief, knowing things that David worked hard to lean. <br />
<br />
And I got it just like that! While he had to work hard for it, Anyway sitting here playing this video game, not realizing how good video games really are, because when I was a stupid 4-year-old. I hated them just like how David hates them now, remembering how I was when I was in now his 4 year old body. I had no idea what was going on in the game, or how to use the controller. but i just know now, plus It was a little funny when I gave David a chance to play with me, but he just didn&#39;t understand it anymore. He shouted about how video games are stupid and that he doesn&#39;t want to play them anymore. <br />
<br />
And that was fine by me. I love sitting here playing this, trying to kill the last boss, of this game, what I&#39;ve been working on all last night until 4 am, and all day today. I still can&#39;t beat it, but I love every moment of it. I want to beat it so I can shove it in Travis&#39;s face when I see him at school tomorrow. He&#39;s now my best mate, well he used to be David&#39;s, but now I&#39;m him, Travis is now mine. <br />
<br />
But I don&#39;t feel that bad about taking his body right now. because David is happily playing with his blocks in his room the last time I saw him, and mom said she will keep an eye on him. <br />
<br />
And right now, I got the boss down to like 5% health, and I knew I was going to beat him Right NOW! Never have gotting this close, Then someone barged through the door, and it was David who ran straight in front of the screen with an amazingly happy smile on his face, looking at me and saying “Brad, I need to show you something!” <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I could not believe what he is doing I told him to nok I could not see what was going on and felt the vibrashon on my contraler and hering how my charter was getting hit, and and quikly shouted “DAVED!!! GET OUT THE WAY NOW!!!!” and he did looking slitly concerned about my outberst and moved but it was too late and I saw “YOU DYED!” on the screen, and felt anger wash other me, and looked down at him with rage seeing he could tell he did something wroing and did not kear about upsetting him and shouted at at him “WHYYY??? DAVED YOU LITTAL BRAT, I TOLD YOU TO NEVER COME INTO MY ROOM WITH OUT NOKING, AND NOW YOU MAD ME DIE!!! AND THAT TOOK ME HOURS TO GET THAT CLOSE, AND IT IS ALL YOUR FUCKING THOLT!! NOW GET THE FUCK OUT AND DONT BOTHER ME EVER AGAIN! <br />
<br />
But I did not expect what happened next, Daved started to cry and look terfide, and said in a whisper toun “i... I only wanted you to come and see the cool tower I made for you” and ran out of my room. <br />
<br />
I looked at the stuped game with the “YOU DYED”  on it and felt like an ideat, I just yelld at Daved and new, he has never yelled at me like that when I was in that badly and him in this one, when I would do 5x more worse things than just waling Infront of a videogame! <br />
<br />
And new I needed to make it right, with him mostly being forsd to have my body and my old persnalty, and knowing it is unfear, he was just following my old persnalty and being the kid I once was, and ran out of my room and in to my old one now Daveds, and saw him crying under his sheets like I would normaly do, it is cray how much persnalty we got from theres body, what makes us act like each other. <br />
<br />
I went up to him and sat on his bed and pulled off the sheet seeing my old body crying his eyes out and Daved said strat away “i...im sorry, Im... im just a stuped baby, and made you losse your game, I won’t bother you again” and turnd around and looked at the wall still crying. <br />
<br />
I just felt bad for cosing this over a stuped game, and put my man in his small shoulder feeling it shack, so and strockit and said “Daveid you did nothing wroung, will you relly sured of nocked, but I should not have shouted at you like that, im now your older brother, and I treated you horribly, and I know you wound of not even rasd your voice if I did that when I was in that body, so why don’t you show me this cool tower?” <br />
<br />
Daved looked up at me and said “no, it is stupid,” with him now crying any more what made me feel a little better, with this being the ferst time I made him cry, and said “no it is not, I am happy you desided to make it for me, and now im looking folweds to seeing this tower, and seeing you crash you car in to it!” <br />
<br />
David smiled up at me and said, &quot;Well... okay,&quot; with him hopping out of his bed. I followed him to the obvious tower of blocks on the floor, going up like 7 blocks, which was actually quite impressive for a 4-year-old. I could only get up to 5 before it fell down, when I was in that small body. <br />
<br />
 But then again, he still has a lot of his intelligence, being the cleverest kid in his class. He pointed at it and said, &quot;So this is it. It took me forever to make the tower this high, and now I want to show you how cool it is when a car crashes into it!&quot; <br />
<br />
I just smiled at him, knowing I was just like this two weeks ago. It was hard to believe how childish I was, and David is now, and how I think of this as childish, when I would of thought of this as really cool 2 weeks ago. <br />
<br />
 But I said, &quot;Cool,&quot; sitting on the floor, smiling seeing how happy David is because I am here, and watched David ram the car and his arm into the tower, making explosion noises and looking amazingly happy. I said, &quot;Wow, that was crazy, David!&quot; <br />
<br />
David Jump up and down say “that was soo cool, wasn&#39;t it, can you help me build a bigger one?” I sighed, knowing I was going to be stuck &quot;playing&quot; with David all afternoon. and We started to build the next tower while I said silly jokes to him and I thought about how David used to do exactly this with me when I was the 4-year-old, and smiled and the happy 4 year old.</p>
