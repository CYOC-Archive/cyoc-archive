Connie’s POV<br />
===========<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn that Maedel! I hope she’s suffering right now! I guess the old saying is true “Around an elf, watch yourself!”  Well, I made the mistake of trusting her and now I’m a flipping cow! At least as a pig I’d managed to retain my ability to speak! Now I’d be stuck on a farm with nothing but “moo this” and “moo that” for conversation.&quot; At least that&#39;s what I tried to say but all that came out was unintelligible bellowing. I did not like being a cow, at all. Sure I was taller, I was no longer looking at tables from below or looking up at my friends but that didn&#39;t matter because they became cows, too! <br />
<br />
&quot;What are we going to do? Sit around table playing cards like a bunch of dogs?&quot; I bellowed, angrily, &quot;Why do these udders have to hang between my legs like that? It feels so weird to have something hanging there. Is this how guys feel? Maybe I should invent something to hold it up and out of the way. Boys have underwear, right? It’d be like a bra for udders. Maybe it could help with this soreness too. Someone better come along and milk me soon because this is getting frustrating!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Easy girl!&quot; a farm hand told me, &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s only temporary.&quot; <br />
<br />
I mooed back at her but she just patted me on the head, condescendingly. I made a mental note to ask Morgana to transform her into a cow when we were changed back. &quot;Let&#39;s see how you like it!&quot;<br />
<br />
=========<br />
Sara’s POV<br />
=========<br />
<br />
We spent our entire first day on the farm without Maedel so much as dropping by. At first I resolved not to talk to her at all. I’d give her the silent treatment and she’d come begging to apologize.<br />
<br />
As the day wore on I got increasingly concerned. She was all alone in a strange city full of sorcerers. What if she had been transformed into a… a footstool! Yes. I could definitely see her being changed into that.<br />
<br />
I decided against escaping. I wouldn’t know what to do if I got out. My hunger got the better of me anyway and so I started grazing. I thought this wasn&#39;t so bad until I felt my insides rumbling. A gassy bottom burp rumbled out from my rear end. I looked around at the other cows and hoped they hadn&#39;t noticed.<br />
<br />
Eventually, we were sent back into the barn for milking. This was going to be terribly embarrassing. I hoped I wasn&#39;t going to be picked first!<br />
<br />
=========<br />
Hazel’s POV<br />
=========<br />
<br />
We spent our entire first day on the  farm without Maedel so much as dropping by. At first I decided I’d give her an earful as soon as I see her. Even If I was a cow she’d get my meaning and apologize.<br />
<br />
As the day wore on I got increasingly concerned. She’d foolishly had us all transformed into cows leaving herself all alone. She was a good fighter but that’s not always enough, especially against magic in a city full of sorcerers. She’s probably already been turned into a footstool or something by now.<br />
<br />
I decided I had to escape. Maedel could be in trouble so my first priority was finding her. I followed the fields fence around looking for a way out or a week point. If it wasn’t so damned high I could just go over it! It would have been no problem as a human. In the end my hunger got the better of me and I started grazing. I thought this couldn&#39;t get much worse but I was wrong. My intestines groaned and I was unable to prevent a riotous fart from ripping from my puckered butthole. I turned to see if any of the other cows heard and saw my &quot;twin&quot; Sara staring back at me. <br />
<br />
Not soon enough we were brought back into the barn for milking. I hoped it would be over with quickly. <br />
<br />
============<br />
Andrew’s POV<br />
===========<br />
<br />
Four other cows joined me after my transformation in the casino. Doubtlessly they were other victims of the casinos wicked games. Apparently, five transformed cows was a new record as we were pulled in front of a gnome with a camera, a strange device I’d only seen once before, and a picture was taken of us. It was several hours before I was dragged back to Saltlick Sam’s farm with the other cows. Neither my sisters nor Maedel came to visit me. Part of me hoped they wouldn’t come see me until my two weeks of “work” on the farm were up but then I thought that no-one had said anything about changing back afterwards. I may well be stuck as a cow for a while!<br />
<br />
The sun had set when Sam finally returned, as drunk as a dwarf no less,and prepared to take us home. “You are going to make me a lot of money, Princesses,” he drunkenly slurred, rubbing in my gender swap. We spent the night in cramped stalls in a barn, with little room to manoeuvre our cumbersome bodies, and had to suffer the degrading indignity of having to relieve ourselves where we stood. By morning the barn stank of manure.<br />
<br />
“Eat up, ladies. You’re going to need ”all the sustenance you can get these next two weeks.” Said Sam as he opened our stools and led us outside into a large field to graze. I tried to veer off from the rest of the herd. If I was going to suffer the indignity of grazing on grass and pooping in the open I preferred to do it alone. <br />
<br />
Eventually, Sam returned to direct us back to the barn. I was dreading this but I followed a reddish-brown colored cow to the barn for my first milking, nonetheless.<br />
<br />
=============<br />
Morgana’s POV<br />
=============<br />
<br />
I felt like I’d awoken from a strange dream where’d been scratching myself and watching Sara, Maedel and Connie wander about aimlessly with not so much as a single Prince transformed. Aside from Andrew but he hardly counts. It made no sense as my dreams almost always include transforming Princes into things. <br />
<br />
I remembered following some cows into a barn and through a busy town. Was that all a dream too? I stood pondering and chewing my lunch. It tasted delicious and had a smell like freshly cut grass. As a vegetarian I’d tried a lot of different greens but this was new.<br />
<br />
 There were an awful lot of cows about here too and another barn.  A man came over from the direction dressed in tan color leather.<br />
<br />
“Please head to the bar now, miss.” He said. <br />
<br />
Hmph, as if I’d interrupt my dinner to follow some fool to a barn. I refused to even dignify him with an answer, tutted loudly and turned away.<br />
<br />
“You certainly are a stubborn one. Sorry to do this but while you’re working here you have to follow the rules,” he said and produced a long whip. <br />
<br />
Who the hell does he think he is? If he does what I think he’s planning I’ll turn him into a donkey. Then we’ll see how he likes being whipped.<br />
<br />
He unravelled the whip part way and pulled it behind him, preparing to strike but I’d strike first with a spell.<br />
<br />
“MOOOO!” I said, expecting to see him transform. Instead the whip flew at me and swatted my behind! “MOOO!” I yelled again. That really stung. Why had he not changed. He sighed and pulled back for another strike. “MOOOO! MOOOO!” I tried my spell twice more and still no effect! Another sharp blow whacked across my rump. <br />
<br />
“Screw standing here” I thought, and turned to head toward the bar as fast as I could. I heard the jingle jangle of a bell as I walked. He must be ringing it behind me.<br />
Inside the barn, a young lady in an apron and bonnet stood waiting. “In here, please.” She said, directing me into a stall. I slowed down to a walk and heard the familiar clop of hooves on the barn floor. That was odd. There weren’t any other cows about. Other cows? I noticed something weighty jiggling between my legs and realized they weren’t my only limbs clopping on the floor. It finally dawned on me – I was a cow!<br />
<br />
“I’m a cow? When did this happen? How?” I asked but heard nothing but mooing.<br />
<br />
“I’m supposed to be a powerful witch! Maybe I died and have been reincarnated. Damn you, Karma! No, let’s just think for a second. I don’t think it was that long ago that I was with Sara and the others. What happened before that?” my mind raced but before I could come up with an answer the young lady entered my stall with a pail and stool. I moo’d in protest and backed away but my stall was too small.<br />
<br />
“Hi, I&#39;m Maisy. First time, huh? Don’t worry. I’ll be gentle,” the milk maid smiled and told me. I knew that smile. That was MY smile. She knew I wasn’t really a cow and she was enjoying every second of this. At the very least I now knew I hadn’t been reincarnated.<br />
<br />
“&#9835; Hush little moo cow, don’t you cry. Mama&#39;s gonna squeeze your udder dry &#9835;” she sang whilst setting her pail underneath me, taunting me. <br />
<br />
She flicked one of my long teats and watched it wobble. I knew she was going to drag this out as long as possible. Her hands hovered over my a pair of teats so close that I could feel the warmth radiating off of her hands. There was a dull ache in my udder that began to scream louder and louder for attention<br />
<br />
“Well, should I start?” Maisy, asked.<br />
<br />
I moo’d back. It didn’t matter what I tried to say. I felt her warm hands squeezing and tugging at me. Wringing of the milk from my udder caused a loud ringing as it sprayed into the tin pail. Now the whole barn knew I was being milked. With each rush of liquid out of my tender flesh I felt a strangely pleasant tingling. Before I knew it I was enjoying being milked and moo’d, contentedly which pleased my milk maid, greatly.<br />
<br />
When she was done she patted me on the head like a child and moved onto milk the other cows. I made a mental note to change her into a cow if I ever changed back. &quot;The we&#39;ll see how you like it!&quot; I bellowed.</p>
