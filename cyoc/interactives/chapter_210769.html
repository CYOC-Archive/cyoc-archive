<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From within the bathroom, Dennis heard the subtle lure Criasa used, and at first it didn&#39;t register. Still reeling from everything that had happened, that he was now an Elf who had the ability to transform into a female wolf at will and back, as well as finding there was more to what he had become and that it was somehow because of the strange programme on Rowan&#39;s laptop, he squeezed his eyes shut. Trying to keep himself in control, feeling overwhelmed by all of it, including his discovery that he very well might have access to all of the spells he told the Chronivac he had access to as an Elf, something that had almost led to him lighting the bathroom on fire, his head snapped up.<br />
<br />
All of this was instantly forgotten as he looked at the bathroom door, confused. From somewhere on the other side, he could hear the most seductive sound he&#39;d ever heard. Wanting to go to it, he almost did, but stopped when a small voice within his mind asked, &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
The effect the same as if he&#39;d been doused in cold water, Dennis found he&#39;d couldn&#39;t come up with a reason. Part of him wanted to answer the call, not caring the least bit he was buck naked, yet another part of him didn&#39;t understand why he should. Reaching for his clothes, he began to put them on, fighting to ignore the sound and his own body&#39;s desire to go to it. Opening the bathroom door, he peered out into the hall and called out, &quot;Tristan? Rowan? Do any of you hear that?&quot; but didn&#39;t receive any reply.<br />
<br />
Ready to pose the inquiry again, he felt the words dry up in his mouth as the sound seemed to intensify. Fighting to ignore it, he was displeased when, against his will, he started to head toward it.<br />
<br />
Inside the basement living room, the creature that had been until moment&#39;s ago Tristan, smiled when she heard the fool call out. Nothing left of the former teenage boy, it would have horrified him if he&#39;d known what would have come of turning himself into what he&#39;d innocently assumed was a fun, cool, and unique D&D character to play. Smiling, not caring at all what had been stripped from her the moment she came into being, Criasa strengthened her cry, her hunger growing as she did. Imagining the meat she&#39;d soon be sinking her teeth into, she salivated a little, but not enough to cause her to drool.<br />
<br />
Out in the hall, Dennis&#39; mind still waged its mental tug-of-war. It hard to stop himself from walking toward the alluring song, now certain that was what he was hearing, he tried to find a way to ignore it as a part of him screamed of danger, that he should listen to the naught. This harder than he&#39;d realised, it wasn&#39;t until he came to the living room door that things seemed to blend together. Thinking he might have found a way to block out the sound, he was in the middle of struggling to cast an enchantment of deafness over his own ears when he saw what it was making the sound. The moment he spotted the creature, and she saw him, his magick spell went into effect, the sound disappeared, his mind cleared, whilst the being launched itself at him.<br />
<br />
Hands raised up, fingers splayed with intent to attack him with her now razor sharp fingernails, Criasa was unaware that her Siren song no longer held any sway on the male before her. Still singing it, she didn&#39;t get within a foot of prey when she was thrown backwards. Watching all this, surprised by the fact that his magick actually worked, as well as at the realisation that this creature had to be Tristan, as it looked like how his friend described his character, Dennis cried out, &quot;Tristan. If that is you, you have to stop. Fight against whatever hold this thing has over you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughter, dry and without humour, Criasa peered at the fool and spat, &quot;I am not this Tristan you speak of. He is gone,” missing that her words literally falling on deaf ears.<br />
<br />
Unable to hear what she&#39;d said, but guessing what it must be when she leapt at him again, Dennis hissed when her fingernails ripped through the sleeve of his shirt. Acting on new instincts he didn&#39;t know he had, but figured must have come with what he&#39;d entered into the Chronivac programme, he backhanded the monster away from him and searched for a spell to subdue her, but not kill her. Believing his friend must still be within the creature, that it was only a matter of reaching him, Dennis held onto this slim sliver of hope as he stepped into the basement living room, took a defensive stance, and readied what magick he had at his disposal.</p>
