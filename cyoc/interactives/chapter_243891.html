<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After school, Lucy starts walking home, ‘what a shitty day,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I could use my powers to MAKE Tim be my boyfriend, but… that wouldn’t feel real’.<br />
<br />
“LUCY, WAIT UP,” she then hears a voice behind her, turning her eyes widen in surprise when she sees Tim running towards her. The 13-year-old skids to a halt, panting, “I… was hoping… to catch you… a-after school,” he pants.<br />
<br />
Lucy tilts her head, “why… I thought you didn’t want anything to do with me”.<br />
<br />
The 13-year-old rubs the back of his neck, looking slightly away, he then lets out a sigh, “look… I’m sorry for earlier,” he says, “I… I was just in shock… I’ve never had a girl approach me and… well… be so direct”.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, for that… didn’t mean to…,” Lucy starts.<br />
<br />
Tim cuts her off by raising his hand, “no… I should be the one to apologize, Lucy,” he says, “I’ve been thinking about our conversation, and what you have said, the entire day. And… well…,” the boy trails off, looking a little awkward.<br />
<br />
“What,” Lucy asks.<br />
<br />
“I… I think you are… stunning,” Tim mumbles quietly, shuffling his feet, “the most stunning girl in the universe! So… I wanted to ask… Lucy… d-do you w-want to… um… be my g-girlfriend?”<br />
<br />
Lucy’s mouth drops open, but then she beams, and before the boy is able to react, the girl lunges at him, wrapping her arms around the 13-year-old and pressing her lips against his mouth, slipping her tongue into his cavern.<br />
<br />
Tim let’s out a muffled squeak of surprise, but then wraps his own arms around the girl, kissing her back. After a while Lucy breaks the kiss, both panting and blushing, Tim chuckles, “well… I guess that’s a “yes”, hm?”<br />
<br />
Lucy giggles shyly, “um… yeah,” she says.<br />
<br />
Tim smiles, taking Lucy’s hands in his, “so, girlfriend, anything you’d want to do?”<br />
<br />
“Actually, I’d like to just… walk with you,” Lucy says, “maybe… we could head to the park?”<br />
<br />
Tim smiles, “sounds good to me,” he says, so the two start walking hand in hand towards the park.<br />
<br />
As they walk, Lucy can’t help but smile, ‘I planned to take my frustration out on Jeff,’ she thinks to herself, ‘welp… he can call himself lucky that it turned out differently. But… hehe… I MIGHT just have some fun when I’m back home’.<br />
<br />
Later that evening, Jeff is walking through the city, to scared to head home… scared of what his sister would do to him. Jeff is sulking, ‘none of my friends want me to stay overnight,’ he thinks to himself, ‘and if I tell them the reason why I’m to afraid of going home, they… they just laugh at me and tell me that I am crazy. I am NOT crazy! That… that… THING pretending to be my sister… THAT is CRAZY!’<br />
<br />
“Oooooh, Jeeeeeeess,” a familiar voice calls out which has an echo to it, suddenly Jeff feels weird, the boy groans as he feels his body seem to separate into tiny particles, before being put back together. When Jeff’s vision returns he finds himself in his room, which once again looks more like the room of a 6-year-old girl, and when he looks down at himself he lets out a groan when he notices that he is, once again, a little girl wearing a school uniform for 6-year-old girls. “Well, hello Jess,” Lucy says, smiling, “how was your day? And my, you look absolutely adorable this evening”.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighs, “won’t you ever get bored of this,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“I WOULD, if I’d keep you like that,” Lucy says, grinning, “that is why I am NOT keeping you like that, it’s just to much fun transforming you back and forth… hehe”.<br />
<br />
Jeff gulps hard, “why are you doing this?”<br />
<br />
“Easy, because it’s FUN,” Lucy says, “I must thank you, haven’t I discovered that program of yours, which, by the way, I have deleted from your computer, I wouldn’t have this amazing power!”<br />
<br />
“YOU WHAT,” Jeff shouts.<br />
<br />
Lucy grins, “hehe… without that program, you’ll be unable to get silly ideas,” she says, “speaking of which…,” she then suddenly snaps her fingers, “I doubt you even remember it anyway!”<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly feels dizzy, which vanishes just as quick as it appeared, “remember what, Lucy,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Have you ever heard of a program called “The Chronivac”,” Lucy asks.<br />
<br />
“No… what is it supposed to be,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
Lucy grins, “oh, nothing that you should worry your little head about,” she says, ruffling Jeff’s long black hair.<br />
<br />
“HEY, cut it out,” he says, “come on, Lucy… stop doing this… I don’t wanna be a little girl!”<br />
<br />
Lucy just giggles, “oh, but you are so cute,” she says, “and deep down I KNOW you are enjoying being a girl”.<br />
<br />
“I. AM. NOT,” Jeff shouts, stamping his foot.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah, keep telling yourself that, Jess,” Lucy says, grinning, “now, since it’s past your bed time, I suggest you get dressed and hop into your bed”.<br />
<br />
“WHAT!? But it’s just eight in the evening,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Lucy sighs, “well, I guess I have to “help” then,” she says, snapping her fingers.<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly feels his body move on its own, “STOP THIS ALREADY,” he shouts as his hands grab a pink nightgown after having stripped out of the dress.<br />
<br />
Lucy giggles, “stop what,” she asks, “stop my little sis from getting the sleep she needs?”<br />
<br />
“I. AM. NOT. YOUR. LITTLE. SISTER!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, but you are,” Lucy chuckles, watching Jeff struggle, trying to regain control of his body, however, the 6-year-old girl is soon tucked in bed fast asleep, “there we go,” Lucy says, smiling as she leaves the room.<br />
<br />
Lucy then hears the front door open, “LUCY, JEFF, I’M HOME,” she hears her mother call, a evil grin appears on the 12-year-old’s face, ‘time for some more fun,’ she thinks to herself before calling, “MOM, CAN YOU COME UPSTAIRS FOR A MINUTE? THERE IS SOMETHING I’D NEED TO TELL AND SHOW YOU!”<br />
<br />
Jane, their mother, walks up the stairs, “what is it, sweety,” she asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, first… this might be hard to believe, but… I am a witch,” Lucy says, smiling up at her mother.<br />
<br />
Jane tilts her head and raises her eyebrow, “come again?”<br />
<br />
“I. Am. A. Witch,” Lucy repeats, giggling.<br />
<br />
“Well… prove it,” Jane says, crossing her arms, “make me believe”.<br />
<br />
“Alright, what can I do to convince you,” Lucy asks.<br />
<br />
Jane taps her chin, “hm…,” she says, then grins, “you know, back when I was a your age… I’ve always wondered what it would be like being a boy… so… IF you truly are a witch: transform me into a 12-year-old boy, BUT only for tonight! I want to, and HAVE to, be back to normal in the morning”.<br />
<br />
Lucy widens her eyes in surprise, but then she grins, “a boy, eh? Sure, I can do that, and I promise you’ll be back to being our mom in the morning,” she says, raising her hand and aiming her palm at her mother, her hand starting to glow in a white light.<br />
<br />
Jane’s eyes widen as she finds herself being surrounded by a white glowing aura, she then feels herself shrinking, while her long black hair shortens, her breasts shrink and when she feels something growing from her privates, her eyes widen even more, soon a 12-year-old boy is standing before Lucy wearing a Spider-Man pyjama.<br />
<br />
“Well… convinced,” Lucy asks, grinning.<br />
<br />
Jane looks down at himself in disbelief, “this… I… wow,” he says, “I’m really a boy!”<br />
<br />
Lucy giggles, “yup, so, how does it feel like,” she asks, “you kinda look like a younger version of Jeff”.<br />
<br />
“It feels weird, but… not really much different than from being a girl or woman… only difference, really, is that I have a cock between my legs instead of tits on my chest… to be honest… I actually enjoy being a boy more than being a woman,” Jane says, looking at her daughter, “so, I wouldn’t mind becoming “James” from time to time,” he adds with a smile.<br />
<br />
Lucy smiles, “I think we can arrange that,” she says, “now, ready to see what I have to show you?”<br />
<br />
“Yup,” the boy says.<br />
<br />
“Then follow me into Jeff’s room,” Lucy says, leading “James” into Jeff’s room.<br />
<br />
“Jame’s” eyes widen when he notices that Jeff’s room looks more like a little girl’s room and his eyes widen more when he sees the 6-year-old girl sleeping in the bed.<br />
<br />
“What’s up with this,” the “boy” whispers.<br />
<br />
“No need to whisper… James,” Lucy says, giggling, “Jeff, like you, asked me to transform him into a little girl. And asked me to promise to keep it a secret, however… I thought you, as our mother, should know”.<br />
<br />
“James” looks at the little girl, “well, I always thought he was a little weird,” he says, “I mean… whenever we went shopping, I saw him glancing over at dolls, and even at girl clothes, however… he never mentioned anything”.<br />
<br />
Lucy nods, “I assume he was just to embarrassed,” she says.<br />
<br />
“James” nods, “makes sense,” he says.<br />
<br />
“He said, being transformed into a little girl is a stress relief for him,” Lucy says.<br />
<br />
“So, I assume you’ll change him back when he has to go to school or be himself when needed,” the boy asks.<br />
<br />
Lucy nods, “yes, I only transform him when he’s home,” she says, “but who is to say that he might want to go out as a girl from time to time, like on the weekends”.<br />
<br />
“Well, as long as you change him back, I have no problem with it,” “James” says, “but I guess I have to keep this and that you are a witch a secret?”<br />
<br />
Lucy nods, “it’s better that way,” she says.<br />
<br />
“James” nods, “alright, I promise,” he says, “however… in return I want YOU to promise to transform ME into “James” whenever I ask for it”.<br />
<br />
Lucy grins, “we have a deal,” she says.<br />
<br />
“James” smiles, “cool,” he says.<br />
<br />
Lucy giggles, “now, I think we should get to bed,” she says.<br />
<br />
“James” nods, “yeah, I really need some rest, it has been one hell of a day,” he says, and so both exit Jeff’s room, “by the way… what is Jeff’s name as a girl?”<br />
<br />
“Jess, of course,” Lucy giggles.<br />
<br />
“Right… silly me,” the “boy” chuckles, his eyes then widen, “damn… I can’t sleep like this in my own bed!”<br />
<br />
“You can sleep with me,” Lucy says, “and when you awake, you’ll be back to being my mom and find yourself in your own bed, I promise!”<br />
<br />
“Alright, I’m fine with that… sis,” the “boy” says with a wink and grin.<br />
<br />
Lucy grins back, “then let’s get to bed… bro,” she giggles.</p>
