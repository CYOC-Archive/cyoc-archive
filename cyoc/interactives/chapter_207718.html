<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you needed a new name, you were called Perfect Bloom. The satyr community thought it became you. Oakius chose the name and you liked it, as much as you loved him. In truth, Oakius just named you Perkiest Buttocks in his head but as he could not really make it your official name, he decided on another with the same letters at the start. But unbeknownst to you, he continued calling you Perkiest Buttocks inwardly. Especially during your sexual intercourses. Your many sexual intercourses. Because at first, you found your mating pleasures only with him. You figured you had all the time in the world to meet the other males. And Oakius was more than happy to satisfy your needs by fulfilling his very own desires. He filled you and pleasured you, just like his penis demanded your attentions. His semen shooting deep within you was never disgusting. It was just to be washed afterwards but a powerful sign of life nevertheless. Sex was a mutual pleasure and indeed love-making occurred in a bathtub as well. Oakius insisted to make you try many positions and places so you could indulge in your own self-discovery. Being penetrated from behind and rolling kissing in the hay was more pleasurable than you would have ever guessed, especially when Oakius grabbed you and carried you on his shoulder to playfully lie you down in the dried grass. That made you giggle and endeared by this, he expressed his passion. <br />
<br />
He left you with so much of his seed, several times a day, that it wasn&#39;t long before you got pregnant. Luckily Oakius, if he enjoyed pregnant sex, knew what to do and what not to do. The leader of satyrs was most gentle, making sure not to harm the foetus or foetuses you were carrying. And his semen still was placed in your womb, he affirmed that it would strengthen any male developing in your belly. And he kissed your bulge lovingly, predicting great beauty and impressive strength to the newborn or newborns. He chuckled, joking that it would be a surprise if there were no twins or triplets or a whole litter inside of you, with all the seed and thrusts he had gifted you. The other nymphs were kind to you, letting you perform only the lightest tasks so as to rest and offering you many advice. And the bulge upon your belly expanded quickly. It was coincident with movements inside of your womb. A lot of movements. Either the baby was already extremely active or your lover was right and she was indeed expecting an entire litter. The nymphs reassured you by saying a squirming baby was a strong baby and the males kissed you, claiming that as you were as fertile as you were beautiful, they wanted to receive your sweet favors when you were delivered of the babies. You giggled, repressing your fears. The large belly you know sported was a sign of life, after all. <br />
<br />
As you were approaching your time of delivery and you were resting munching on plums, a commotion occurred on one side of the camp. Everyone gathered as Bear, a satyr that only sported a goat tail but the lower body and ears of a bear due to a strange ancestry, entered with a net on his strong shoulder. A net that held not a dead prey but a live captive, squirming and furious. Bear was also worthy of his namesake through his strength, muscles, size and body hair. <br />
&quot;Look what I caught!&quot; he bellowed in joy. &quot;He&#39;s really cute!&quot;<br />
In the net was a cursing youth of about twenty, shaven, with short dark hair, torn clothes and a dirty skin. Bear said he was hunting far away and saw a battle between two armies and that he had picked up this youth. He wouldn&#39;t be missed too, because he had fled the battle like a coward. Bear removed the youngster from his net and held him forcefully in his arms, grabbing the sponge and wooden bowl full of water to wash him. Unheeding of the youth&#39;s protests, he scrubbed him, continuing his story. The youth had caught his eye and since he was looking for a mate, he figured he [referred taking him in rather than see him killed as a deserter if he was caught. The army would look for a human, anyway, and not a satyr. He then kissed the youth on the cheek.<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you happy, Robin? Bear is going to protect you from the bad soldier men.&quot;<br />
The young man tried to punch Bear and screamed insults, saying that stupid name wasn&#39;t his and that he wanted to leave and that he would never be Bear&#39;s mate. <br />
&quot;Why this name, Bear?&quot; asked a paunchy satyr.<br />
&quot;Because he fled the battlefield like a scared little bird,&quot; he guffawed.<br />
Everyone laughed as Bear tied Robin up. Even Oakius broke the circle and clapped in appreciation, then slapping Bear on the shoulder with friendliness, congratulating on bring back such a fine young new member for their community. Bear bowed with a smile to his leader and picked up Robin to go towards his hut, amidst cheers and more clapping. Even the children sang little songs and jumped and trotted as Bear pulled the curtain to his abode, going for some privacy. Although children in the camp saw people kissing and indulge in light touches, they were not to witness the actual deed before puberty, hence love-making occurring in discreet, private or specific locations, explaining parts of the camp or houses restricted to adults, as well as bedrooms restricted to parents only within the homes.<br />
<br />
Bear deposited a still-squirming Robin on a bed consisted on pelts on the ground. Because of his size and weigh, Bear didn&#39;t bother with an actual bed. He then wrapped his arms around the youth, who screamed aggressively anew.<br />
&quot;Now, now, I want to get to know you, that&#39;s all. After all, soon this will be your home too and...&quot;      <br />
Robin spat that he was not in love with men and that he hated homosexuals. The large man asked if he had tried, ever, and when Christian looked at him with utter revulsion, Bear laughed, saying that that he could not know if he liked men as much as women. He then installed Robin between his legs and started his ministrations. Robin growled and hurled insults but Bear knew what he was doing. He massaged, kissed, nibbled, caressed and licked various parts of his body. He did not touch Robin&#39;s genitals but that was for later,. He had to check something first. And Bear knew his experience had offered him the right hints. To Robin&#39;s utter mortification, his penis shot right up in a short amount of time.<br />
&quot;Ooh, straight as a rod!&quot; exclaimed with glee Bear.<br />
&quot;No!&quot; hissed Robin, mortified to tears. &quot;I hate homosexuals!&quot;<br />
&quot;Your body indicates otherwise,&quot; Bear smiled. &quot;Mayhap you display anti-male love tendencies all the better to hide that you actually love men as much as women, don&#39;t you think?&quot;<br />
Robin shouted his denial, but of course his virile member still was high in the air. Worse, as he struggled and Bear touched more his upper body, it started swelling. Bear, as a good satyr, noticed it.<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s see what our little friend here has to say about what turns you on, shall we?&quot;<br />
Unheeding of Robin&#39;s protests, scratching lightly the chest of his captive, massaging his feet and big firm hugs as well as kisses in the neck got Robin&#39;s penis twitching madly, and Robin utterly desperate for release. Bear finally squeezed lightly but firmly Robin&#39;s penis, stroking it and telling his partner to not be ashamed, that his new life was starting and that he&#39;d be happier, much more that he&#39;d ever been in his sad previous life where he&#39;d lied to himself as a poor misguided human. Soon, Robin&#39;s penis released a copious amount of cum and he lied back upon Bear&#39;s chest, who kissed his cheek and his head, saying he had done extremely well. He picked up the naked panting youth and went outside again, smiling at the cheers, claps, whistles and jeers erupting all around him. All could see that Robin had let go of his reluctance extremely fast in spite of his claims. <br />
Bear went straight to Oakius&#39; temple and waited as his leader finished having sex with a nymph, patiently. After Oakius had ejaculated inside his lover, he washed his groin and started towards his companion, all smiles. He could see the cum stains upon the thighs of the young man, clear hints that the youth was not as disgusted by manly love as he had claimed. Typical. Those who shouted they were disgusted by certain sexual practices between the same gender were the same ones that became incredibly excited, unbelievably fast by what they held as completely repulsive. Hypocrites and liars, all of them. Oakius knew that sex should always be a pleasure, not a punishment. It wasn&#39;t for nothing that love between partners became a sexual act. This youth was foolish but he&#39;d learn soon enough. <br />
&quot;I see you&#39;ve made our guest feel welcomed. I commend you, Bear.&quot;<br />
&quot;I thank you, my lord. But he is still reluctant to accept his own pleasure.&quot;<br />
Robin stared at Oakius with a murderous glare. Oakius wanted to laugh or sigh. Some gods had punished for a lot less.<br />
&quot;Still believe you&#39;re a ladies&#39; man? Do you?&quot; smirked Oakius.<br />
Robin still glowered.<br />
&quot;Why is it so bad to admit you like both genders? We&#39;re all like that, here, and all are happier accepting their desires,&quot; he tried to reason the youth.<br />
He stood silent and surly.<br />
&quot;Do you think the ladies here pretty?&quot; asked Oakius.<br />
Robin hissed a reluctant &#39;yes&#39; between his teeth.<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;ll enjoy them too. To all your heart&#39;s content. But you enjoy the touches of men just as much. Accept that and understand there is no shame to be had. That no one ever judge you.&quot;<br />
No answer was forthcoming but Oakius decided to move on to the matter at hand.<br />
&quot;But cannot remain here as a human. Luckily, I do possess the powers inherent to a god. So what will it be, boy? Satyr or nymph?&quot;<br />
&quot;Satyr&quot; both yelled Bear and Robin, which made Oakius laugh out loud.<br />
&quot;Very well, very well. So what appearance, then?&quot;<br />
The youngster shouted his indignation and Bear offered his suggestion. Oakius would have liked to turn the youngster into a donkey-like satyr, or a mule-like satyr in honor of his silliness and stubbornness ness but Bear wanted a usual goat-like appearance for his lover. Oakius had to admit that it was fitting too. As a typical satyr, he&#39;d fit the image of a seducer of females, as the male symbol of virility he wanted to keep so much. With a wave of his hand, Robin saw his lower body shift dramatically, his feet become cloven hooves, a tail sprout from his lower back, tufts of dark hair erupt on his arms and legs, his ears become that of a goat and horns grow out of his forehead. He then went off to visit the snake in the tree for the night.<br />
<br />
A half-moon later, Perfect Bloom was getting grateful help in nursing triplets. All boys, two with goat-like characteristics and blond hair, identical twins and the spitting images of their father Oakius and the third with palomino colors and horse characteristics, probably a hint at Perfect Bloom&#39;s previous heritage in his very distant past that she had forgotten almost completely. Oakius had been right. All that seed and thrusting had indeed brought a multiple birth and much strength in male newborns. The satyr leader was beside himself with joy and promised Perfect Bloom he&#39;d start over as soon as the babies were weaned. Perfect Bloom said that she had other suitors and Oakius waved the argument off, insisting they all had eternity and that he could be patient. His bed was there for all to enjoy.<br />
As the new mother nursed her babies, she saw Bear cuddling and kissing his new mate. Robin had greatly changed, spending his days experimenting with all satyrs and nymphs eager to discover each&#39;s specialties in matters of sensuality. He ministered to Bear&#39;s enormous penis (he was proportional) under its loincloth just as much as Bear&#39;s own strokes never failed to make the youngster lustful. He never turned down a male suitor or virile advances anymore, that was certain! And Robin lovingly talked about his mate&#39;s great prowess and incredible muscles, as well as how amazingly gentle he could be. No doubt, the snake had returned to the village a true satyr from a reluctant human. No one was complaining and Oakius was happy. Yes, between the triplets, the new youth serving as mate to his best hunter, and the few other births earlier this year, everything was good and well for his tribe. That sense of having fulfilled his responsibilities excited him further as he was pounding into another satyr, fondling his testicles at the same time, bleating moans of pleasure escapring the other&#39;s mouth.</p>
