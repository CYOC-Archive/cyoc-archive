<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the water sprayed her naked flesh, touched and ran over specific areas of her body, she stared at the various bottles kept in the bathroom by Richard&#39;s mother. Reading them, seeing body washes, shampoos, conditioners, facial scrubs, bottles which moisturised, stuff meant to be used on her genitals, Bianca was overwhelmed by the choices. Believing there&#39;d be no issue with using a couple to bathe herself, she was at a loss as to where to start.<br />
<br />
Her mind for the most part feminine, she was coming to understand there was more to it than what she given herself with the use of the Chronivac. She saw herself as female, identified, acted like, and talked like a woman, but there was stuff she finding was missing, such as with her confusion with the hygiene stuff left in the shower and bathroom. And as she stared at the various bottles, understanding coming to her, it spiralled from there as she realised she still had all of Richard&#39;s memories. Instead of recalling growing a girl, transitioning through her teenage years to become the young woman she was, she instead had memories of being a boy, a teenage male, then a young man. Looking down at her groin as she thought about how she&#39;d stood to pee, she understood she had no clue as to what she was supposed if she had to pee, beyond sitting to do so.<br />
<br />
Mentally she made a note to fix this the moment she became Richard again. Selecting the body wash, figuring her hair really didn&#39;t need a wash, she popped open the top. Breathing in the rich scent of berries, she squirted a dollop in her hand and started to work it over her face. Guessing what else to do, Bianca worked her way through the selection of items, choosing some, passing over others. Almost an hour later, smelling strongly of berries, baby powder, among other things which made her think she smelled feminine, Bianca stepped out of the shower. Drying herself off, she considered wrapping around her torso a second towel, and instead exited the bathroom naked.<br />
<br />
Back in the bedroom, she pulled on one of Richard&#39;s shirts. The garment too big on her, Bianca figured what she needed were clothes of her own. Heading back downstairs, she sat before the laptop and ignoring the Chronivac, she clicked on the internet browser. Navigating to several websites, she spent the next couple hours purchasing for herself several wardrobes of undergarments, dresses, skirts, pants, tops, shoes, and pyjamas, among other necessaries. As she did this, she also made notes using the laptop&#39;s typing software on what she purchased, how much it cost, and where it&#39;d be delivered. Believing Richard wouldn&#39;t mind having her stuff sent to his apartment, Bianca entered the needed information on the various sites and completed her online shopping.<br />
<br />
Finished with this, she turned her focus to herself. Keeping the typing software pulled up, she entered in information for Richard to include in her profile once she went back to being him. As she did this, she familiarised herself with her body, pausing at one point to go search for a small mirror. Finding a hand-held one in the downstairs bathroom, she used it to examine her privates. Studying the sensitive nub which was her clitoris, the squiggly flesh which was her vulva and the openings for her urethra and vagina, she eventually turned her attention to other parts of her body.<br />
<br />
Her notes getting longer the more she went over her body, and gave serious thought who she was and what she was missing, Bianca at one point toyed with the idea of entering the information herself. But fearing it might disrupt the timer counting down, she decided to wait.<br />
<br />
When the timer reached zero, she wasn&#39;t at first sure what would happen. But as she suddenly felt the same sensation as the last time wash over her, Bianca understood what would happen as she felt a buzzy, tingly sensation ripple through her groin, abdomen and through her genitals. Her clit growing erect as a feeling she could only describe as almost an ache, a longing, as the buzzy sensation went up into her vagina, she leaned back in the chair she was sitting in. Spreading her legs, pulling up on the shirt until everything of hers from the navel down was exposed, she ran a hand downward. Tracing a fingernail over her groin, she soon slipped two fingers between her legs. Feeling more turned on than she&#39;d ever felt as Richard, she teased her clit, which was not only erect, but had started to elongate. Slipping off the chair, Bianca squatted down, and still fiddling with what was quickly becoming a thin, long, penis, she bore down as a pressure inside her blossomed and began moving downward.<br />
<br />
The area between her legs morphing, she gasped as with a sensation like something inside her popped as her ovaries, now testicles, slid into her fused vulva. Scrotum now formed, it and her cock shifted forward, and wiggling out of the shirt, Bianca had a momentary fit of giggles as she noted how she looked like a chick with a dick. And then her breasts began to shrink as her hormones shifted, her waist lost its pinched look and her hair regressed. Her dick going from a semi-soft state to outright hard, she worked a morphing hand over the erect shaft, she, now he, was torn between wanting to move slowly and savour the moment, and the desire to really go at it and pound his pud. Hair growing over his body, height and age increasing, Richard continued to work his meat as his transformation neared its completion, and feeling as if her was about to blow his load, and not wanting to make a mess, he grabbed the shirt and just barely managed to use it to cover himself as he orgasmed and released. Gasping at not only this, but also the feel of the soft, cotton fabric as it brushed against the tip of his penis, as well as the sensation of his four teats growing in, which part of the shirt also brushed against, he wondered if it&#39;d be like this every time he became Bianca and then turned back.<br />
<br />
Not having any sort of answer, but thinking it probably would be so, he headed upstairs to clean himself up and redress. Afterward, he returned to the laptop. Sitting down in front of it, seeing what he&#39;d been working on as Bianca, he found he didn&#39;t really need the notes, as he recalled everything he&#39;d observed. But, keeping them handy, he pulled up the Chronivac. Saving a copy of Bianca&#39;s profile, he set to work updating and filling out the stuff he&#39;d missed the first time, starting with her memories, moving on to her interests, then onto other things.<br />
<br />
When he was done with this, he felt as if there were still details he&#39;d forgotten. Trying to see things from Bianca&#39;s perspective, he wondered if maybe he ought to change back into her. But seeing the time was almost two in the morning, he figured it’d have to wait. About to save and close the programme, he instead added one more thing. Giving Bianca the ability to turn herself, at will, into a Eurasian otter, and back to a human, Richard thought this might give him the option to also experience time the world from the perspective of an animal at the same time. Yawning, he saved and exited the programme and stumbled up to bed. Lying down, he drifted off to sleep with questions as to when he’d next use the Chronivac.</p>
