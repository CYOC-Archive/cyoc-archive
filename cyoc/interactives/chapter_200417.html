<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was strange how natural all this was. Just a few hours ago, he was a struggling college student. But now? Chris was now a gruff, masculine, and sexy detective. Not only that, but he had all the knowledge he needed to do his job while retaining the memories of his old life. Chris was absolutely ecstatic at this development or, at least, he would be if he didn&#39;t feel overworked. That address on that note was, in fact, a crime scene, but it turns out he was just there to babysit some rookies. If he had complete control, he would have been able to solve the case in 20 minutes flat! Ah, but he guessed that having a strong police force was better than just having one excellent detective. If only he could have one of those rookies help him with the paperwork, though. It was only lunchtime, and Chris was already exhausted with all he had to do. If only he had someone to help him out, he could probably enjoy his new life more.<br />
<br />
Wait! That was it! He needed an assistant, no! A partner! And Chris knew exactly who should be his partner, a certain college student who was now living his life as a suburban dad. The question was, where would Anthony be now? Thankfully Chris&#39; detective brain thought up an answer. Anthony was probably overwhelmed by his transformation and most likely seeking comfort food for lunch. This means that Anthony was theoretically at his favorite restaurant, the Chicken Shack, eating lunch. Well, let&#39;s hope that Chris&#39; intuition is correct.<br />
<br />
One drive downtown later and Chris had arrived at the Chicken Shack with Chronivac in hand. Now, if his hunch was correct, then Anthony&#39;s name should show up on the Chronivac scan. There he was! Chris looked over to where the computer said his dormmate was and was taken aback. Damn, he looked worse than I thought, thought Chris. Old, blading, and fat, Chris thought Anthony looked miserable. Well, that needed to change. Pulling up his friend&#39;s profile, Chris overrode the suburban dad package with the noir detective package and decreased the transformation time to 10 minutes. Anthony didn&#39;t seem to like the situation he was in, so there was no need to draw out the transformation. Finally, Chris edited the relationship between him and Anthony from friends to partners, leaving the detective satisfied with his work. Now, as much as Chris wanted to see Anthony&#39;s transformation, he probably should get back to work. So Chris ordered a chicken sandwich to-go and awaited his partner to get back to the station.<br />
<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
What happened to him? Anthony asked himself. How did this happen to him? He used to be a college student with his whole life ahead of him, but now he was an old, fat, balding dad without a child. What was he going to do now? His roommate was missing when Anthony went back to the dorm, and Anthony couldn&#39;t just go to class. Not sure what to do next, Anthony told Mae that he needed time to himself. So, he made his way to the Chicken Shack for lunch to process things or at least to order some comfort food. God, he used to care about keeping a slim figure, but now it was almost natural for him to overeat as he already let himself go.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, while Anthony was moping, he noticed that his body was feeling odd again. Looking down, he saw that his gut and moobs were quivering. What was going on now? Anthony silently asked himself. Anyway, he couldn&#39;t just sit here out in the open when this was happening to him again, so the changing man quickly ran into the bathroom to ride out his changes.<br />
<br />
There was a large mirror in the bathroom, a perfect place to see the changes happening to him. The first thing Anthony checked was his quivering stomach and mobes. They were still quivering, but on closer inspection, he realized they were shrinking! In fact, all the fat he had gained was getting burned off right before his eyes. It wasn&#39;t long before all of it had burnt off, and Anthony was back to the slim figure he had this morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phew,&quot; Anthony sighed in relief as he patted his familiar flat belly. Were the changes wearing off? Well, if it wasn&#39;t, at the very least, he wasn&#39;t fat anymore. Looking back up at the mirror, the changing man saw that his hair was growing back! Maybe he was returning to normal. Wait, was his hair always this thick, not to mention it was in a shorter style than before he changed. His mustache was disappearing, but in its place was a 5 o&#39;clock shadow. Oh no, as much as want to deny it, seemed like he was turning into something else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hgnn!&quot; Anthony grunted as he leaned against the sink in pain. His entire body was quivering this time as his body was exploding with muscle. It was a good thing he bought bigger clothes, or else he would have easily burst out of them. Although the shirt he was wearing was getting quite tight against his shoulders and back as they broaden. Anthony should have been concerned, but instead, he was smiling. Smiling at the feeling of his arms bulging in his sleaves, his chest bulging out, his abs appearing two by two, and the way his legs filled his pants. All this muscle, he wasn&#39;t a bodybuilder by any means, but man was he ripped now. Maybe it wouldn&#39;t be bad if he stayed like this long-term.<br />
<br />
Once those changes were done, the finishing touches were all that were left. Looking up from his new muscles, Anthony noticed that his face has changed to be more square, and rugged. Anthony swore he saw a face like this somewhere in like a movie or something before but didn&#39;t quite recall where. The biggest change to his face, however, was the look in his eye. They now had a focused, if not a bit cynical glint to them. Finally, the clothes he was wearing shifted to a professional dress shirt and slacks with suspenders.<br />
<br />
Oh, man, Anthony thought. This was a much better body to be stuck in! The changed man wanted to just rip off his clothes to get a better look at his new body, but then some new thoughts entered his head. These thoughts were telling him that he shouldn&#39;t just be hanging around here; he had a job to do.<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Back at the station, Chris was busy sorting out some paperwork, eager for Anthony to arrive. If his calculations were correct, he should be here any minute now. And on cue, Detective Anthony had arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Anthony you&#39;re looking better than you thought you would,&quot; the detective greeted his partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re a sonofabitch. You&#39;re the one who changed me, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; the newly minted detective replied. Anthony wasn&#39;t mad at his partner, just annoyed at the situation he put him in. &quot;You better be planning to make it up to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Turning you into a sexy detective wasn&#39;t enough?&quot; Chris walked closer to Anthony to get a closer look at him. Man, he really was handsome. Especially with how that dress shirt of his, did not hide any of the new physique he had. Suddenly, acting on complete instinct, Chris grabbed Anthony and began kissing him. Anthony was shocked, but then felt that feeling he had when he was a suburban dad. That all of this was natural, so he began kissing Chris back. The two didn&#39;t know how long they were kissing before, Chris realized what he was doing and broke the kiss.<br />
<br />
Wait! Why did they just do that? No, when he inputted &quot;partner&quot; in the relationship tab... Chris&#39; train of thought, however, was interpreted as Anthony pulled him in for another kiss. Ah, who cares, Chris thought, this was hot.</p>
