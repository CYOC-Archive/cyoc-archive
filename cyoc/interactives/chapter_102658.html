<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">NOTE: While I wish Tabitha and Lucie well, I have absolutely no idea what to say or do with the characters at this time, so have gone back to other points within the overall thread.—tmw.<br />
<br />
A tad after 6:30, Nate Anderson saw his boyfriend&#39;s car park at the curb in front of the Anderson residence. As he got out and secured his car, Nate&#39;s heart almost skipped a beat, for Alex Ramsey was dressed to kill, in a full suit with matching tie and polished dressed shoes.<br />
<i>If he looks that good now, imagine our wedding day...</i> was the stray thought that crossed his mind, as Nate opened the front door before Alex could ring the bell. &quot;Hello handsome. You&#39;re certainly living up to your rep tonight,&quot; said Nate with a smile, eyeing Alex very intently.<br />
&quot;You look great too stud,&quot; said Alex, giving Nate a quick kiss. The older Anderson was dressed similarly, but his suit was blue where Alex&#39;s was black.<br />
&quot;Something like this is apparently a big deal in Moon Lake, so I dressed accordingly,&quot; replied Nate, as he heard his parents start to come down the stairs.<br />
Both boys turned to see Mister Anderson slightly ahead of his wife, wearing a gray suit that looked as if he just came from a high level board meeting. Nate&#39;s mother was wearing a beautiful blue dress that was now at least one size too small since she became a werecat, but that change only gave more accent to her feminine charms.<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Eric?&quot; wondered Alex.<br />
&quot;Mrs. Stovall is bringing him and Julie. We&#39;ll meet them there. The ceremony doesn&#39;t start till 7:30. You don&#39;t mind riding in our car, do you Alex?&quot; asked William Anderson.<br />
&quot;No problem sir,&quot; he replied.<br />
Mister Anderson thought about that for a second, staring at how Nate looked at his boyfriend, and said, &quot;If you&#39;re going to be part of the family someday, at least in private you can call me William.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; replied Alex, smiling at the prospect.<br />
<br />
After locking the front door, the two couples held hands until they reached the car in the driveway. The married Andersons sat in the front, while the boys sat in the back. Along the way, Martha and William questioned them about how the open house at the college went, and about their plans for the future.<br />
&quot;The more I think about it, the more I&#39;m warming up to the idea of becoming a teacher trying to establish a writing career on the side. I even jotted down some ideas for what might be my first book while I was getting dressed, but I have no idea what grade and subject to specialize in, provided I should even specialize at all,&quot; admitted Nate.<br />
&quot;That is a tough choice,&quot; agreed his father, &quot;but one I didn&#39;t have to make until towards the end of my second year so I could plan my courses for the remainder of my college term.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then how did you decide what to select?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
&quot;I went with what I liked,&quot; replied his father.<br />
&quot;Then how come you&#39;ve never taught a class in regards to the works of Robert B. Parker?&quot; wondered Nate, referring to his father&#39;s favorite author.<br />
William Anderson wanted to admit the truth and tell his son that Elizabethan literature paid better than examining the works of a modern writer, but instead just replied, &quot;Who says I haven&#39;t?&quot; he asked in return, driving on to their destination.<br />
<br />
Their destination was a modest single level structure on the opposite side of Moon Lake&#39;s downtown area, owned by Tachibana Enterprises. The parking lot was almost full, but William managed to find a space. Uncertain what the Stovalls or Harry Jenkins drove to begin with, no one could say whether or not the rest of their party were already there.<br />
Outside the main entrance, they were met by one of Akane no Tachibana&#39;s grandsons, who briefly waved a metal detector over each guest before allowing them to enter. Inside the lobby, they were greeted by Mrs. Tachibana herself.<br />
&quot;Konichiwa,&quot; said the elderly Japanese lady, bowing slightly next to her grandson Daisuke. &quot;My apologies about the extra security, but with the impending arrival of Miss Harper&#39;s family next weekend...&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; said William, after everyone returned the bow. &quot;Is she and her fiance already here?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. Inside,&quot; replied the leader of the Skulk, pointing to a set of open doors. Through there, everyone could see the reception being set up for later, and another set of double doors beyond that open to reveal the main meeting area. &quot;I recognize everyone present except this young man,&quot; she said, looking at Alex.<br />
&quot;Alex Ramsey, my boyfriend and date for the evening,&quot; answered Nate proudly.<br />
&quot;Congratulations. I hope you two find much happiness together,&quot; said Akane, unfazed by the fact that two men were in a serious relationship. &quot;As is our tradition, inductees will be sitting in the very front row, with their guests in the second row immediately behind them,&quot; she explained. &quot;But are we not an Anderson short tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Realizing that meant Eric wasn&#39;t there yet, Martha and William looked at each other, wondering what to say, when a voice called out, &quot;I&#39;m here.&quot;<br />
Everyone turned and saw Eric walking in with Julie Stovall on his arm, her mother behind them. He was dressed in a gray suit similar to his father&#39;s, but Julie was dressed in a stunning sea-green outfit that did everything one could ever want an outfit to do to indicate that there was a beautiful girl present. No member of Eric&#39;s family could say what was brighter, the smile on his face or the sparkle in his now deep sea blue eyes.<br />
<i>He&#39;s a were-merman now,</i> every were present realized, as they each took a discrete sniff and smelled a slight scent of fish coming from all three of the new arrivals.<br />
&quot;Konichiwa and my apologies for being late,&quot; said Eric, bowing before Mrs. Tachibana. &quot;I followed my heart as you advised,&quot; he said, still holding Julie&#39;s hand in his, but pulling her a little closer to him. &quot;Now it has led me here,&quot; he added, looking at his family.<br />
&quot;I see, and congratulations Eric,&quot; replied the Skulk leader, realizing what was going on. Then she noticed the single pearl necklace around Julie Stovall&#39;s neck and knew what it meant. &quot;One should always listen to their heart, for it is the only voice guaranteed to always speak truly. Mrs. Stovall, Miss Stovall, a pleasure to see you both again,&quot; said Akane, addressing the ladies with Eric. &quot;Will Mister Stovall be joining us tonight as well?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; answered Melissa Stovall. &quot;Martin&#39;s away on family business and I&#39;m here simply as a chaperon,&quot; she explained, nodding at Eric and Julie.<br />
&quot;I see. Well then, the ceremony will be starting in a few minutes. Should we all go find our seats?&quot; asked Mrs. Tachibana, before turning to let everyone walk past her into the meeting hall.</p>
