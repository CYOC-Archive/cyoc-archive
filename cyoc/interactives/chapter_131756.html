<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once Eric was dragged back into the lab, he was poked and prodded with needles and scans for an hour, taking every possible test to check his physical state. His shoulder feels sore from where he landed when Arthur threw him out of the water. He would have to update the male subject&#39;s physical statistics later because to execute that impressive throw would take an inhuman amount of strength. And maybe he would also write something down about Kay. He can still taste her tongue in his mouth and her scales under his hands. Something happened out there to make him do that, to make him fall under her spell. Shaking the image of her massive breasts out of his head, Eric tries to watch the screens feeding from the tank&#39;s cameras. Kay and Arthur have long since finished their mating and he has gone back to sleep near the seaweed forest while Kay is swimming towards the small cave in the middle of the tank. Even though they would be monitored 24/7, Dr. Ferris thought a more private enclosure would benefit the pair. And there she is, climbing up out of the water and onto the small rocky bank inside the air pocket. She likes to sleep here to get away from Arthur. A smile grows on Eric&#39;s face as he watches her fall asleep. &quot;Eric.&quot; He turns to the voice belonging to Dr. Ferris. &quot;We have much to discuss young man. Follow me to my office.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hours and hours go by and Eric is still in Dr. Ferris&#39;s office. Eric is twiddling his thumbs as he sits across from Ferris smoking his pipe and reading a science journal at his desk. He expected the older scientist to be furious with him for getting intimate with his priceless test subject but Ferris never once lost his cool. They have redrawn his contracts and security clearances to fit his new position in the lab and Eric should be happy he wasn&#39;t fired. But he still wants to know how it will work out. They&#39;ve been sitting here for ages waiting for the tank to reach its artificially scheduled sunrise to go down and try to communicate the new plan with the test subjects. Eric is sure Kay will like it but he doesn&#39;t want to get pummeled by Arthur again.<br />
<br />
Their wait ends as the clock chimes to the sun&#39;s arrival. &quot;Well Eric. Let&#39;s go see how this works. And remember if they reject you, you&#39;ll be lucky if I let you scrub the floors.&quot; The head down the stairs into the lab and out onto the platform deck of the tank. The simulated sunrise has risen up past the fake horizon and the sky is still full of pinks and oranges. On the ramp near where Eric landed are his belt and tablet that he lost when Kay dragged him under. He kneels down at the ramp looking into the water as Ferris takes out his megaphone. &quot;Kay. Arthur. Come up. We need to speak with you.&quot; Nothing happens for a few moments until Kay surfaces. She swims closer, drifting more towards Eric than Dr. Ferris. &quot;Hi Kay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Eric. I need to talk to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Subject 2. I hear you go by Kay now.&quot; Chimes in the old man.<br />
<br />
Kay&#39;s snaps back bitterly. &quot;Yeah I kind of have to since my old name wasn&#39;t exactly feminine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric turns back to Kay and holds her hand. &quot;Where is Arthur, Kay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m right here, human.&quot; The merman surfaces from the water, his impressive torso almost fully out of the water. He swims over to Kay while maintaining his distance. He looks wild but controlled. Kay seems to have some control over him because with a glance, his posture relaxes. &quot;Remember Arthur. We are humans too. They just made us into these things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Kay, things have surely improved between you two. He isn&#39;t nearly as aggressive as you said yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well as soon as I woke up this morning, he was in my cave and he left me a giant fish he had caught. And slowly but surely he started talking to me again. Tell him Arthur, you can trust Eric with anything. He is a friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
The merman hesitates but soon speaks, &quot;I still feel kind of cloudy but I&#39;m starting to feel more like myself. It&#39;s like I couldn&#39;t control what I was thinking before, eveything was instinctual.&quot; Ferris takes out his tablet and starts typing in notes, while Eric keeps asking questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what are your instincts telling you now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to protect Kay and keep her healthy. Until the baby comes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric and Ferris both smile, with Ferris even coming down to the ramp to get a closer look at the mermaid. Both of the merfolk flinch with the old man getting closer but they stay surfaced. &quot;You think she&#39;s pregnant? How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like you said to me yesterday, Eric. Once I got pregnant, his animal instincts should calm down. They have.&quot; Arthur nods and touches her stomach. &quot;We both can feel it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric stays by the ramp while Ferris makes a call on his tablet. &quot;Yes, prep the examination table for a blood test. We might have a pregnancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arthur tenses up and bars his arm in front of Kay protectively. &quot;No. She stays in the water with me.&quot; Arthur pulls her behind his back and flexes his giant arms in a waiting attack. It is clear if Ferris tries anything, Arthur will break every bone in his body. &quot;Wait! Arthur wait. This is why I&#39;m here. I can do it. I can test her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arthur keeps Kay behind him. &quot;Talk human, I mean, Eric.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s clear you don&#39;t like Dr. Ferris or any of the scientists here. But Kay and I made a connection yesterday. She trusts me. So I&#39;ll be the middle man. Whatever tests or scans that have to be done or if you guys need something, I&#39;m your guy. If you want me in the tank with you, I&#39;ll gear up and go down with you. They need you two to cooperate or who knows what will happen to you guys. Ferris will never touch you again, Kay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arthur looks back at Kay and she nods, directing him to move out of the way. &quot;Okay Eric, I trust you. But take my sample out here.&quot; A lab tech opens the door and hands a blood test kit to Eric. He lowers himself to Kay on the ramp and keeping her eyes locked on his, takes a sample. He hands it back to the tech who rushes back in the lab. Ferris nods to Eric approvingly and follows the tech.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what now you guys?&quot;</p>
