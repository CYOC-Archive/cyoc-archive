<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rusty and Terry worked well together and got their share of the work done for the day quickly, both going on to help others around the ranch until the work was done. That was always what his pa said, &quot;Until everyone is done their work, no one is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dinner was strange for Jason if not for Rusty. Him and his parents, a younger brother still in high school named Harrison, and two of the ranch hands. It was always Terry and one other. They always invited one other every night to help them feel like they belonged as part of the team, and Terry lived on the ranch so he was always there. Jason was a bit surprised as a beer was set down on the table by him, but Rusty picked it up and drank as if he had been doing so for years.<br />
<br />
Conversation went as it always did, or so he knew from the memories of this life. What happened on the ranch today, things that needed to be done, then other topics. It was easy and warm conversation, it moved to in front of the TV as the night went on. Jason was loving this time as Rusty, it felt like home. As it got late he excused himself to his room.<br />
<br />
It was so different from Jason&#39;s room. For one, Rusty kept it neat, but it was also larger, with a bed big enough for two and a Rusty&#39;s personal belongings strewn about. A guitar he knew he could play if he picked it up. A computer he rarely touched. Books he spent more time with. He took off his shirt and tossed it into the laundry hamper just as there was a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
He opened it and smiled, Terry was there and he stepped aside to let his friend in. As soon as the door was closed Terry was on him, hands rubbing at his chest and lips meeting. Jason&#39;s moment of discomfort melted into the familiarity of it from Rusty. These two had been doing this since Rusty was sixteen and they had discovered their mutual attraction. Eight years.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t had a chance to shower yet.&quot; Rusty protested as Terry started working at his pants. Only a bit of clean up before dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t care.&quot; Terry never seemed to mind a little sweat and grime. Said it made it feel more real. Rusty&#39;s pants his the floor, soon followed by Terry&#39;s clothes. They barely stopped kissing during the process of stripping, hands exploring the familiar lines of each other&#39;s bodies. Jason lost himself in Rusty&#39;s need for this other man.<br />
<br />
They fell onto the bed, and Rusty pulled the lube from where he kept it in his nightstand, first getting it on his fingers and lubing up Terry&#39;s hole before Terry grabbed the bottle away and used it to get Rusty&#39;s rock hard cock slicked up. By now the two had it down, they knew what they liked and the fell into it.<br />
<br />
Rusty thrust himself into Terry, who had long since gotten used to the other man&#39;s large cock, moaning as he felt it enter him. He kissed Terry&#39;s neck, one of his hands tweaking the man&#39;s nipples as he plowed into him. He knew Terry&#39;s body as well as he did his guitar, and played them both with equal skill.<br />
<br />
This time was different though. It was Jason blended with Rusty. Normally there was a little hesitation, a bit of shame before he got over it. This time there was only the need. Jason had never experienced anything like this. He had never even been with a girl, but even he knew this was something else. The strength, the feeling of his hands caressing hard muscle. There was nothing soft or delicate about his partner, it was primal. Rusty had been ashamed of his desires, Jason found them fascinating.<br />
<br />
Terry came first, he always did. But Rusty didn&#39;t hold back long, hilting himself in the other man, letting their bodies tense against each other as they sank into their combined pleasure.<br />
<br />
Rusty rolled onto his back and Terry turned to face him. Fingers stroking his partner&#39;s furry chest. Jason as Rusty discovered he liked that feeling of his chest hair being stroked. &quot;That was different.&quot; Terry said. It had been. For once he had held nothing back. &quot;You really are going to tell him, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rusty nodded. There would be no showers tonight. He didn&#39;t mind sleeping a little dirty and the sheets needed changing now anyway. He fell asleep with Terry curled up against him.<br />
<br />
It was later in the morning when Rusty woke. The off day giving him a chance to sleep in. Terry was still asleep in his bed and he decided to leave him there. Slipping into his bathroom Rusty took a quick shower, well, quick as it could be once he decided he needed to jerk off as well. Remembering last night, experiencing this new body, it mas more Jason&#39;s need. But he had something he needed to do this morning. A promise to keep.<br />
<br />
Drying himself off, he got dressed, this body no longer feeling too big or clunky. It was just right for him. He knew where he would find his father. Down in the office, even on an off day he would do some work, just not out in the field. So Rusty stopped in front of the door and knocked waiting for the signal to come in.  He opened the door and stepped inside. &quot;Pa, there&#39;s somethin&#39; I need to tell...&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t his father&#39;s office. He was back in the shoe store. Rusty&#39;s personality drained away, and most of the memories, too. That last twenty four hours were clear as a bell though and Jason felt himself flushing. He still wore Rusty&#39;s body but he was back to being only him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It made me gay.&quot; He said, looking over to the clerk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did it matter?&quot; He asked back, still smiling softly as he leaned against the counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; And Jason realized it didn&#39;t. While he himself wasn&#39;t made that way, he didn&#39;t seem to care if he ended up in a life where it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said. The right shoes call out to us. It might not have been completely perfect, but it would work for you.&quot; The clerk stood up and walked over to Jason, having to look up at him in this body. &quot;So. What will it be?&quot; Jason blinked in confusion. &quot;Keep those, take your old shoes back, or try on another pair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I keep these?&quot; Jason asked, turning to look at the door he stepped through.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll return to the point you left. I can even put those on hold for you if you&#39;d like to think and try on another pair or two. Whichever one you decide to keep you&#39;ll continue from where you left off. That will be your new life.&quot; The clerk smiled. &quot;So? Pick.&quot;</p>
