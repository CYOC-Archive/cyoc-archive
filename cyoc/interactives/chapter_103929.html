<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Agent Theodore Green was a relatively pleased with how things were progressing. The Seattle Police had agreed to cooperate in the investigation and would surely assist in capturing Lionel Ulysses for the purposes of putting him behind bars for good. They&#39;d even had enough background information to apparently pin Ulysses down to one building specifically.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know it&#39;s that particular building?&quot; Agent Peters spoke from one edge of the table, &quot;Earlier you said you know that he&#39;d been using the warehouse district... but didn&#39;t say anything about a specific warehouse in particular.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly because the evidence we have on this particular building,&quot; Detective Smith said with a heavy sigh is rather loose, &quot;the first time we heard of it was when we got reports from one of the warehouse managers of suspicious persons distributing... or trying to distribute drugs to their workers. We came in took some questions and the description we where given matched our present perp... or one of his buddies from the &quot;Rat Pack.&quot; It was that that was the basis for why we want to bring him in, but obviously by the time we arrived he and his buddies were long gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the people that they also tried to sell the drugs to also made mention that they saw them come from that particular warehouse that we marked,&quot; Detective Watson Holmes added, &quot;we asked to check surveillance to confirm their identities... and some of the company bosses were more than happy to provide it, as they didn&#39;t want drugs being sold to their workers... but a few didn&#39;t. Ulysses may not have approached their employees or they may have something to hide themselves... but we&#39;ve never had time for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore and Agent Peters both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless, based on what we have,&quot; Detective Smith finished, &quot;is that this &quot;abandoned&quot; warehouse is the place where the Rat Pack is most likely meeting. It&#39;s not as actively used as the other ones are, there is less direct security around it, and with that there would be less eyes and ears to notice activity. The company that used to use the warehouse even said that they gutted it of everything before they left it and no one else has bought it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s also an older building,&quot; Detective Watson Holmes commented, &quot;built in the forties, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be why no one else has bought it,&quot; Theodore rubbed his chin, &quot;but I&#39;d agree with the deduction. Given that every city police department, county sheriff, and other local law enforcement agencies have told me on how slippery Lionel Ulysses has been, it&#39;d be logical to assume that he&#39;d prefer a spot where he wouldn&#39;t be likely to be seen beyond occasionally being spotted coming into or leaving the general area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore quietly remembered some of the phone calls he&#39;d made with the various police departments and law enforcement agencies that he&#39;d made after his own team had fully identified Lionel Ulysses as a suspect. Some he made after the conference that presented what his team had found and put together on the case and the rest he managed to call on the flight from Washington DC to Seattle the day before. Lionel had proven to be a very slippery character, which Theodore had probably assumed meant that Lionel, like his wife, was a were. However, Theodore couldn&#39;t know for sure if that was true, and didn&#39;t know what were-species Lionel Ulysses was. That privately gave him some concern on if a fight broke out with him in the process of arresting him, but since were-beasts weren&#39;t presently known to the general public, he couldn&#39;t make mention of that at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it the points you&#39;ve marked match where there are doors in the building?&quot; Theodore asked to Detective Watson Holmes. The man nodded and Theodore then moved to a different question, &quot;what kind of officers are you planning to use?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While we are classifying him as armed and dangerous, given what your office and the Seattle Field Office has already reported in to us after this murder he committed in Virginia,&quot; Detective Watson Holmes said slowly, &quot;given the small size of the Rat Pack and that we haven&#39;t found any evidence of them being involved with anything bigger than a handgun... we&#39;ll only have standard patrol officers with their cars at each point in teams of two. We would all go together with another four officers to make the arrest. If they run, the officers parked in the area will be placed to catch them... and if they fight, they can converge from all sides.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We may still one additional units at all the outside points,&quot; Agent Peters commented, &quot;just to make sure. Especially if they all flee together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that if Lionel fights that we have numbers to subdue him without killing him,&quot; Theodore commented, thinking over the strength that weres had.<br />
<br />
Marci didn&#39;t have the body of even a female body-builder, but Theodore knew she was well toned and was actually easily stronger than he was. He even figured that she didn&#39;t fight against the boyfriend that wanted to attack her when they first met because she didn&#39;t want to risk infecting him with a strain of the were-virus that would kill him. Marci had even mentioned to him that all weres were stronger than Normals. If Lionel was a were, fighting him wouldn&#39;t be easy, especially if it turned out that his were-species was based on a large predator like wolves, lions, tigers, wolverines, bears, or even large herbivores, deer, bison, cattle, horses, and so on.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d actually be stretched rather thin if we brought in more officers,&quot; Detective Smith commented, &quot;and based on what we have... SWAT would be overkill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore thought that SWAT might be just enough if Lionel WAS a were, but he couldn&#39;t reveal that secret.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will have all officers wearing body cameras, so to make sure that any action we take won&#39;t be viewed as excessive,&quot; Detective Watson Holmes added.<br />
<br />
That was fairly standard. Over the various incidents of violence at arrests and police officers being accused of going beyond what is needed, many police departments  were going to use more body cams.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agent Peters, can our field office add at least one agent to each ambush group?&quot; Theodore asked to Agent Peters, since she was the Seattle Field Office&#39;s liaison.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe we can,&quot; Agent Peters nodded, &quot;there may be a few other cases we&#39;re working on, but given exact nature of your case Agent Green, we can spare four field agents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Theodore nodded, &quot;though to start this... because we don&#39;t know WHEN this meeting is to take place, it may be wise that all units sit back a bit...&quot;<br />
<br />
Theodore leaned over the map that the police officers had produced and highlighted points on the map. He then pointed to the warehouse.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must assume that they&#39;re not living in the warehouse,&quot; Theodore spoke carefully, &quot;so while it&#39;ll be a good thing to get set up fairly early... we don&#39;t want to be sitting in the exact ambush points. They&#39;ll see us and likely scatter before we can even spring the trap. We&#39;d want to sit back a fair bit so that if we are &quot;noticed&quot; we&#39;re thought to be normal units on either a normal patrol or on traffic monitoring duty. Nothing that they would lead them to realize that we&#39;re on to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not a bad idea,&quot; Detective Smith commented and rubbed his chin, &quot;based on what WE have for security data, the Rat Pack&#39;s been pretty habitual on when they go in to meet. It&#39;s why they&#39;re the only gang we can truly place Lionel Ulysses in. They don&#39;t always move together, but based on the security footage we have, they&#39;ve always moved through the main gate. We can probably pull some units back to the back end of the district where those units can be hidden by the other warehouses and some of the pieces of equipment they have on hand...&quot;<br />
<br />
He then pointed to a couple of points on the map, which Detective Watson Holmes and Agent Theodore Green watched carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;The rest of us can move back to these points here,&quot; Detective Smith continued, &quot;both groups would be close enough to watch the entry point, but will also be at rather busy intersections. We can actually disguise our trap units as traffic units.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the main team that will go in after him?&quot; Agent Peters wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the units should have radios,&quot; Detective Watson Holmes commented, &quot;there&#39;s a McDonnalds less than a block away...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could use it as a temporary headquarters,&quot; Theodore mused, &quot;pretend we&#39;re getting breakfast... or coffee... and simply wait for confirmation everyone in the &quot;Rat Pack&quot; has wandered in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d work,&quot; Detective Smith commented with Detective Watson Holmes also nodding in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we&#39;re ready,&quot; Theodore spoke with some confidence and with real hope that he would be able to gain justice for Jeff Decker&#39;s murder, as he promised he would.</p>
