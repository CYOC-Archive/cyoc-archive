<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After an evening of freedom for Jake, being able to eat what he wanted and watch what he wanted without <br />
someone telling him off, he got ready to go to bed way past his normal curfew. It was a hot night, too hot to <br />
have the covers on his bed. Although it was the weekend, he grabbed his new clock and set the alarm to 6am, so <br />
he could wake up in time to get ready to meet his friend at the cinema. It didn't take long for him to fall <br />
asleep.<br />
<br />
But by setting what he thought was the alarm, he actually turned on the temporal properties. He started to get <br />
older, one year for every 30 minutes. Throughout the night, his body started to grow through a lanky phase, <br />
his arms and legs stretching out like taffy. An unconscious low groan signalled the moment his voice broke, <br />
his adams apple jutting outwards. Hairs started to become noticeable along his exposed arms and legs. <br />
<br />
3 hours in, he awoke in a daze, vaguely noticing his pajamas felt constricting and made him feel hotter, so <br />
after a bit of a struggle he pulled them off, revealing his lean 16 year old body, lightly muscled and light <br />
hairs starting to appear on his chest. His cock had grown considerably larger, surrounded by a patch of hair <br />
that spread upwards towards his belly button. Emerging scruff lined his sharpening jaw, his face looking less <br />
like a child and more like an adult. He shifted into a more comfortable position, pulling his long legs <br />
towards his stomach. He noted that he'd need to get a bigger bed as his feet were jetting out over the edge, <br />
and quickly fell back into a deep slumber.<br />
<br />
As the hours continued and he crossed the line from teenager to man, Jake started to get even hairer, as it <br />
quickly spread and thickened  over his chest and down his stomach. The light scruff on his chin spread upwards <br />
over his cheeks and thickened into thick stubble covering his lower face with an impressive density. His chest <br />
hair had stretched outwards, vaguely connecting with the growing stubble on his neck and slipping up and over <br />
his shoulders. The patch of hair around his groin had seeped under and over, covering his buttocks with a fine <br />
coating. The hair growth started to dwindle, with it now covering most of his body. His stubble was slowly <br />
growing longer, giving him a substantial beard. Jake rolled over onto his back, his formerly thin body started <br />
to bulk up with muscle, going from lean muscle to broad mounds becoming visible under his body hair. As time <br />
moved on, Jake was starting to show small signs of aging, his impressive muscles were developing a small layer <br />
of fat, softening the six-pack he only just received and making him appear more beefy. Flecks of grey hairs <br />
were popping up in the black beard across his face. His hairline was beginning to retreat backwards.<br />
<br />
When Jake woke up, he stretched his large muscles, scratched his furry face, and stuck a hairy hand out <br />
towards his clock. Damn it, the alarm didn't go off! He got out of bed, standing to his 6 foot height and <br />
glanced at himself in the mirror opposite him. He had a vague sense of unfamiliarity, but it was his normal 29 <br />
year old self. Jake smiled at his reflection, very faint lines appearing around his eyes. To think in a few <br />
months he'd soon be the big 3-0. He rubbed his face, examing the grey hairs he was starting to get in his <br />
beard. He might have to start dying it soon. The thought aroused him, and glancing down at his dick, it was <br />
now erect at its full 7 inch length. He wasted no time with wrapping his hand around it and started <br />
masturbating. He ran his free hand through the thick hair coating his meaty pecs, enjoying the feeling under <br />
his fingers. After a few minutes, he shot a large amount of cum over himself, coating his hairy stomach and <br />
sticking to his thick beard. After laying for a while, Jake stood up and glanced at the mirror again. He <br />
frowned, prodding the top of his head. He'd only turned 30 a couple of months ago, it's much too early for him <br />
to be losing his hair. He sighed and turned towards the door.<br />
<br />
Jake left his bedroom and made his way towards his bathroom, ready to have a shower and hopefully get to his <br />
friend in time. But he stopped in his tracks as he entered the room. There was a hairy, naked stranger in <br />
there! He yelled out and the man copied him. By then Jake realised it was just the mirror. Wait, mirror? Jake <br />
looked down at himself and saw he was a lot taller and beefier, his huge body was coated in hair, matching the <br />
man in the mirror. How was this him? It couldn't be him! He's only a 10 year old kid, yet he looked like he <br />
could pass for his own father! He rushed over to the mirror and examined himself further. His face was <br />
unrecognisable, other than his eyes. It was no longer round and chubby, but now long and square. Tiny lines <br />
were barely visible by his eyes. He had a thick beard, sticking about an inch off his face with some grey <br />
hairs sprinkled throughout the chin hair. There was some sort of substance in the beard, and glancing down, <br />
the stickiness was spread over his stomach and broad chest, also covered with hair. He wiped a bit off his <br />
beard, shivering at the touch, and put it in his mouth. It had an odd taste to it, salty and musky, yet he <br />
sort of liked it. Was this what had made him older? How old was he anyway? 30. Somehow he knew it. He was 30 <br />
years old. The same age as his parents... <br />
<br />
He scratched his head, thinking his hairline felt a little off, but then his whole body was a little off. Jake <br />
was uncomfortable being so tall and bulky. Looking back in the mirror, he noticed his chest hair connected to <br />
his beard and spread over his shoulders, but a glance back could see his back was mostly hair-free. His dad <br />
was rather hairy, but he seemed to surpass him in hirsuteness by leaps and bounds. He looked like he could be <br />
part werewolf or something. At least his body was muscular instead of fat, looking a lot larger than other men <br />
he'd seen around town. His chest was huge, and much wider than his waist which didn't seem as worked on with <br />
no signs of a six-pack. After flexing in the mirror like he'd seen guys do on TV, he noticed his big dick was <br />
sticking outwards. He reached out a hairy hand to it, but then he heard a noise. A rhythmic knock. He knew <br />
that sound anywhere. It was his friend Matthew! They were supposed to meet at the cinema, but he must of got <br />
impatient and came here to look for him. Jake started to panic. He can't go and answer the door looking like <br />
this. But he couldn't just leave him there. Matt wasn't exactly the best-tempered guy when he was angry. He <br />
had to think fast. Stroking his new beard, he suddenly came up with a plan.</p>
