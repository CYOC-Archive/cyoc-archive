<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they walked through the mall, they spoke in hushed tones to each other.<br />
<br />
Despite everything the TF-Pad could do, it had somehow forgotten to give Michelle some clothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;There are so many eyes on me.&quot;she told Mark. He looked over to her, watching her hips idly shake from side to side. <br />
<br />
Michelle became a little squeamish when she noticed that he too couldn&#39;t keep his eyes off of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot;he apologized. <br />
<br />
She looked around.&quot;I am just not used to being the center of attention. Why aren&#39;t they staring at Leira like they do at me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leira huffed in amusement, a plume of smoke escaping her nostrils,&quot;Your views may have been skewed from being a member of the furry community for too long, but most people are not attracted to semi-feral dragons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they ARE to anthropomorphic moths?&quot;she countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a nice ass, wide hips, and are naked. That is going to attract attention regardless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark watched Michelle cover her eyes with her antennas as they entered a clothing store. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, who are we going to transform next?&quot; Mark asked before anyone could embarrass poor  Michelle any further.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say Aaron. Complete the friend group&#39;s assembly.&quot;offered Leira as they began browsing for clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know about that.&quot; said Mark.&quot;He  doesn’t like TF stuff like we do. Remember when we tried to get him into our game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it feels wrong to exclude one of us out of this whole thing. This TF-Pad is a big thing and if we don&#39;t get him into our group, it would be like excluding him from the new, biggest facet of our lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree.&quot; Said Michelle. <br />
<br />
Mark shook his head,&quot;But if we transform him, then that will be permanent. If we could just transform him without having it be a permanent thing, I would do it, but-&quot;<br />
<br />
A beep from the TF-Pad interrupted him. Opening the screen, he noticed a notification. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is now possible to make the transformation temporary, but be wary of side-effects. <br />
<br />
Under any of these conditions, the transformation will become permanent:<br />
<br />
  -The TFee is pregnant <br />
<br />
  -The TFee has sired a child but wouldn&#39;t be able to have done that in their old body. Example:A female-to-male transformed person getting someone pregnant is gonna have to stay male<br />
<br />
  - The TFee likes their new body too much<br />
<br />
  -The TFee isn&#39;t able to become their old self without the world changing in ways that would get someone erased from existence. If, for example,  reality has been changed so that the transformed person has retroactively been given a child, then they must stay their new self, lest they risk annihilating that kid entirely <br />
<br />
  -The TFee would come to harm if transformed back because they, for example, had terminal cancer as their old self<br />
<br />
  - HIDDEN CONDITION <br />
<br />
Thanks for using the TF-Pad. We will continue to work on new features to make it a more pleasant experience.<br />
<br />
  -Godco Department of Customer Satisfaction&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These guys are good.&quot;murmured the dragoness as Mark read that out to them.<br />
<br />
Mark said,&quot;Well, I guess we can change him for a day or so. What are we going to turn him into?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His character from when we wanted to add him to our game.&quot;said Leira.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot;Asked Michelle. <br />
<br />
&quot;It will certainly be a shift in perspective. May help his...romantic pursuits when he knows how it is to be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, we can do that.&quot; Said Mark, putting an end to the discussion upon pulling out a white sundress. &quot;What about this one?&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle shifted in place,&quot;I don&#39;t have the physique for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked down, slightly miffed. &quot;I kind of regret not giving my sona breasts now. I am sure they would have been annoying, but I kind of think they are a part of...the womanhood...I have been craving for for so long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ohh... Now Mark felt kind of bad for not asking more questions before transforming Michael. <br />
<br />
Of course, Leira had to open her maw before he could say anything tactful and supportive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe if you take more estrogen than your new body already has, you will grow a pair?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was surprised when what Leira said wasn&#39;t entirely tactless, but he had to say,&quot;I have no clue how your new biologies might work. We may actually have to transform someone into a doctor, who knows about transformed bodies, in case you ever get sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We may have underestimated the logistics of our new forms.&quot; Agreed Michelle. <br />
<br />
As they drifted off into smalltalk, they found some fitting clothes for the moth-woman. It was firmly adorable how happy she seemed while browsing the woman&#39;s clothing isle. She asked about his opinions often, posing while wearing articles. She seemed to... enjoy his gaze. Mark was starting to suspect that she may not have lost all romantic feelings for him when they broke up a couple of years ago. At least, as he had been told by a woman once, the only reason most women would ask a guy about how they looked like with such regularity was that they liked him. He was pretty sure that wasn’t representative of women as a whole, but perhaps a talk was in order.<br />
<br />
He had to subtly remind her that what she wanted mattered more when it came to her clothing than his opinion. <br />
<br />
She settled on a pair of black, short  pants and a white shirt, which both hugged her curves nicely.  Mark had to find himself in agreement with Leira&#39;s assessment. Michelle had a nice butt. For a moment, he imagined putting his hands on it, stroking across the emerald fur while she leaned into his touch. He shook his head, clearing out the horny thoughts.  Thinking about his friend in such a manner felt wrong, even if they had been a couple once, sporadically having sex.<br />
<br />
When they left the store, they decided to  approach Aaron&#39;s place in the mall. The guy ran a sweet little coffee shop, and Leira was pretty sure it were his work hours right now.<br />
<br />
While Mark and Michelle took the escalator, the dragoness just put a hand on the ledge of the upper floor and pulled herself onto it. <br />
<br />
It didn’t take long for them to find their way to Aaron&#39;s place. Nobody was sitting at the shop. Aaron greeted them as they approached. He was a red-haired man with a neatly trimmed beard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks good on you, Michelle.&quot;He said, checking out her outfit.<br />
<br />
She turned her head away, embarrassed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tough business?&quot;Asked Mark.<br />
<br />
Their friend nodded,&quot;It is kind of hard to attract customers with my little shop.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed and leaned onto the counter,&quot;I fear I am going to have to close soon if you continue to be my sole, regularly returning customers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know something that will help.&quot;Claimed the dragoness mischievously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can put you in an outfit and use you as my mascot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No!&quot;She declared, crossing her arms before nodding towards Mark.<br />
<br />
Activating the TF-Pad, he registered Aaron, seeing his stats. He switched on the temporary-TF-option, changed the duration to a day,   typed  in the name of Aaron&#39;s character, and pressed &quot;confirm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that?&quot;Asked Aaron, only to yelp in surprise when he takes note of the purple chitin spreading across his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;THE FUCK?!&quot;, he said, stepping backwards as the exoskeleton started traveling up his arms, hair falling out to make way for arthropod smoothness. <br />
<br />
His shoes tore away to reveal pairs of wicked claws where his feet used to be.<br />
<br />
As the exoskeleton climbed up his legs his  thighs thickened till they tore his pants away. As his centre of balance shifted, he leaned forward over the counter<br />
&quot;What is happening to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
As if to answer his question, a pair of breasts started growing on his chest. <br />
<br />
With every hasty breath in, his breasts grew while with every breath out, his butt expanded. <br />
<br />
Soon, his shirt gave way, allowing his new E-cup breasts to spill out onto the counter. He stared at his new tits with a blush on his face. They were covered in a softer exoskeleton than the rest. When he slowly moved a hand to give them a squeeze, he moaned, his voice breaking halfway through, taking on a seductively, rumbling quality as his Adam&#39;s Apple receded.  <br />
<br />
The group couldn&#39;t keep their eyes off of their changing friend. His pants fell to the ground to reveal a round abdomen growing out from out of his butt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Becoming quite the hottie.&quot;Commented  Leira.<br />
<br />
Aaron was too distracted by his new, plumb butt to take note. He leaned further forward as his legs grew longer and moaned when his waist gave in while his hips widened. His exposed dick became smaller with every breath, its head becoming a small nub of nerves on the slit that was quickly becoming his new vagina. His testicles were swallowed whole as they became the ovaries that would allow him to lay eggs.<br />
<br />
His beard had already disappeared while his hair cascaded down to his shoulders, taking on a platinum color in contrast to his dark, purple exoskeleton.<br />
<br />
His facial features softened and rounded as his back got more and more of an arch, causing him to raise his butt into the air while his breasts rubbed against the counter.<br />
<br />
Chitin covered his entire face now. Two chelicerae pushed put from the sides of his mouth, reminding them that he was becoming a predator and not just some hot babe.<br />
<br />
Six new, light purple eyes blinked into existence as his nose and ears were left as nothing more than slits in the exoskeleton. His main pair of eyes took on a similar colour as his secondary ones. <br />
<br />
While his body was still being adjusted, the group could see the coffee shop changing. Old chairs and tables of grey metal being replaced with soft wood covered in even softer pillows. Everything became a little more purple as the quality of every item in the shop became better and better. A sign materialized above the shop, showing <br />
Aaron, in his new form, blowing a kiss to the observer.<br />
<br />
What remained of Aaron&#39;s shirt disappeared as he grew  four additional arms, still firmly holding onto the counter. <br />
<br />
With a few small changes, his transformation into a bombshell of a spider-woman was completed. The remains of his tethered clothing flew into the air, becoming a form-fitting uniform that showed just a little bit of cleavage.<br />
<br />
Aaron stared at himself incredulously,  looking into a nearby piece of polished metall and then over to his three friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;What idiot gave Mark this kind of power?&quot;he said calmly, looking at the TF-Pad showing a 3D modell of his new form, yet underneath that facade was an underlying unease and exasperation.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will only last a day for you.&quot; Assured Michelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to be...pretty calm about this.&quot; Stated Mark, awkwardly brushing his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just got magically transformed into... some kind of voluminous spider-woman. I am sorry if the mental breakdown takes some time to arrive. I am currently contemplating whether or not I should break your dick despite you being my...master? Seriousl, what is going on here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron stood up, rising to his full 197 centimeters in height, only triumphed by Leira&#39;s two and a half meters.<br />
<br />
Mark gulped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I can explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You better, unless you want your dick to be L-shaped from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
He explained the happenings of the past day to him and how the TF-Pad works. Aaron is surprised to learn that Michele and Leira had both been human guys in the morning.<br />
<br />
Aaron shook his head and sighed,&quot;I feel as if dunked into a sea of frozen water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Odd way to say you are dumbfounded.&quot; Commented, Leira.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least Mark got hold of the Pad. If Leira had gotten it, we would all be members of her harem by now. I can deal with...this, but fucking Leira? No chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragoness frowned,&quot;I would never do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH, really?&quot;, asked everyone else sarcastically. <br />
<br />
Leira lost a little bit of confidence as she looked away in shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sure that you will at least make more money now.&quot;<br />
<br />
A frown graced Aaron&#39;s face. &quot;How is this supposed to help me make money?&quot;<br />
<br />
A bunch of footsteps could be heard in the difference.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that noise.&quot;, he asked, looking around.<br />
<br />
Mark grinned,&quot;That, my friend, I assume to be the approaching harbingers of capitalism.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
His assumptions were confirmed as three dozen people suddenly started approaching the coffee shop. All eight of Aaron&#39;s eyes widened as if about to fall out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are your own mascot now. Transformed people are rare and interesting.&quot;, explained Leira. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you think your shop is so fancy now? You are making mad cash in this timeline by being your charming self.&quot; Said Mark.<br />
<br />
Aaron turned to his friends,&quot;Would you mind helping me out a little?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all.&quot;, answered Michelle, already having sneaked behind the counter to get a barista outfit.<br />
<br />
With that they faced a tide of adoring fans and pure. Unbridled. Capitalism.</p>
