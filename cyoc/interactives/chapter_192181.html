<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The basement area seemed too foreboding and distant, eerie, not to mention the strange feeling that Andy got from the location. So he decided in the interest of his safety and feeling of security that he was going to try and spend the night with one of the individuals in the other rooms. Andy grimly noted the less than impressive arms on him with a slight chuckle. He did admit he had something of an image of what Dave might be like in his head, but he decided to give the guy a shot. Considering his past with muscular guys - namely the antagonistic and crude, bullying athletes from high school - maybe it was more understandable, but he didn&#39;t want to attach any sort of stereotyping right now.<br />
<br />
Not when the alternative was sleeping in what may as well have been the lair of some hidden monster. The feeling he got from the place seemed hard to pin down, enough that he couldn&#39;t really explain it... but he knew he didn&#39;t want to stay there any longer than he needed to.<br />
<br />
So as he went up to Dave&#39;s room, he wondered what sort of state the bodybuilder&#39;s room might be in. The guy was probably a workout fiend so there was some expectation there... and indeed, when Andy knocked at the door, he heard a deep and rather impressive voice say, &quot;One moment, I&#39;ll be right there. Just had to finish up my protein drink...&quot;<br />
<br />
Before long, Andy heard heavy foot steps echoing forward until the door swung open to reveal Dave.<br />
<br />
The black bodybuilder was tremendous, muscular, hard as steel - and yet had a somewhat boyish, cleanshaven and handsome appearance to his face, curly, short cut dark brown hair on his head, matching dark brown eyes, and a physique like one crafted by the ancient Greek gods to impress mortal men and women both. Amazing what one sees when they&#39;re not intimidated. He was dressed in a pair of yoga pants that seemed tight to his sweltering quads and thighs, and a sweat-stained upper body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about the state I&#39;m in right now. You kinda caught me in the middle of a bodyweight circuit I was doing for some online folks. C&#39;mon in.&quot; Dave gestured, and Andy was left rather surprised when he entered and saw a variety of cameras, and two game stations positioned in a corner by the bed. He had definitely not assumed Dave would be interested in video games, nor that he would be involved in some sort of online workout deal.<br />
<br />
There was a sleeping bag by the corner of the room as well as an extensive number of supplements, protein powders, and protein bars in various bags. Andy looked at the sleeping bag and asked, &quot;What&#39;s this for...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I go exploring outdoors. Sometimes I&#39;ll livestream my adventures. You&#39;re welcome to tag along sometime. I&#39;d really recommend getting more acquainted with nature. Helps with the nerves.&quot; Dave commented, having already observed how nervous Andy was. The young man for his part rubbed the back of his head. He&#39;d assumed so much about Dave just from their terse interaction earlier and gotten a certain impression... but knowing more about him now, it was clear he was not what Andy thought he was like. <br />
<br />
The more Andy looked around, seeing various workout equipment on top of a mat for the thus explained online body weight exercises...the more Andy thought about Marco. He remembered how he was always the more delicate brother. How Marco excelled in sports, achieving great things and gaining the affections of women all around him...while Andy basically got zilch in terms of interest.<br />
<br />
He examined a bench press bar set up on a workout station, looking at the variety of weights nearby it.<br />
<br />
His thoughts were riven with fantasies. Of becoming stronger, more muscular, finally showing up Marco and demonstrating that he deserved to have someone think in advance of him. The more he thought about it the more he came to the conclusion Marco intended for him to be sent down into that cellar. Was it all a cruel joke...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Andy turned and saw Dave cleaning himself off with a towel. &quot;You&#39;ve been eyeing that bench bar, and I can&#39;t help but notice you&#39;re...uh, not exactly <i>currently</i> in the best of shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That obvious, huh?&quot; Andy bitterly commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, usually I charge three hundred for a prospective client. I mean, check me out!&quot; Dave flexed his insane 21 inch biceps and left Andy admittedly speechless at how impressive they looked. &quot;But I can recognize myself in you. Believe it or not, I used to be a regular Urkel. Thin, black, nerdy and picked on nonstop. I got into bodybuilding though, and they backed the fuck off. But I never forgot who I was before I became all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you offering...?&quot; Andy felt a groundswell of hope in his chest. Among other things. The strange feeling was back. Andy itched at his chest a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m saying I can give you some help with fitness.&quot; Dave said with a smile, &quot;You work with me, I can get you in better shape than you&#39;ve ever been in your life. Believe it or not, I&#39;m studying right now for a collegiate degree in nutrition and health. I can not only get you working out, but I can get you eating the right foods. A good physique is started in the gym, but finished in the kitchen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy gulped, itching at his chest, &quot;A-Alright...and you can get me bigger and stronger than my brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet.&quot; Dave said with a grin, &quot;I want you to commit, man. Nothing sucks more than someone starting strong but losing commitment. You in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...yeah. Yeah! I&#39;m in!&quot; Andy nodded even as he felt that strange sensation bubbling over. It seemed to wash over him all at once...and then slowly vanished. Leaving Andy feeling wobbly, strange...but excited nonetheless. He had definitely not expected for his visit to Dave to end with him becoming the black bodybuilder&#39;s apprentice...but he was looking forward to, for once, being the muscular brother.<br />
<br />
<i>I&#39;m not gonna be so soft and easily pushed around any more. Let&#39;s get my testosterone running!</i><br />
<br />
Andy for his part had no idea however what this agreement and commitment would do to him...<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way...&quot; Andy said as he looked around, &quot;I&#39;m not too terribly comfortable staying down there in the cellar...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that I blame you, man,&quot; Dave commented, &quot;Place is eerie as fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you mind if I just made use of your uh, sleeping bag up here?&quot; Andy asked, twiddling his thumbs as he hoped for the best but prepared for the worst. &quot;I mean, I promise I won&#39;t---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. Feel free to stay up here with me as long as you need to.&quot; Dave clapped Andy on the shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to working with you and working out with you, man. I really think you have a great foundation for putting on some good muscle mass.&quot;</p>
