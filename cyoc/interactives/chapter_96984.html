<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frances really didn&#39;t know how to answer or advise Martha on what to do. While Martha was a good friend, and she wanted very much to make Martha a werecat, there was still the main issue of loyalty that she had for Samantha. There was also the fact that she really didn&#39;t know the full ins and outs of whatever had strained Martha and William&#39;s marriage. As such, any advice wasn&#39;t based on all the available information.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t...&quot; Frances began when she heard the back door click open, &quot;Samantha&#39;s back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha looked up and slowly followed Frances, half worried and half nervous. They found both Eric and Nate seated in hallway. Frances&#39;s natural agility allowed her to easily avoid both boys and Martha was thankfully far enough back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Eric asked looking from his brother to his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to be bed, son,&quot; Martha said weakly, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you about this tomorrow...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked at her nervously but followed his mother&#39;s command. Frances and Martha then walked on and made their way downstairs. They found Samantha carrying a fully transformed male werefox. Martha found that William&#39;s muscle mass was larger, but not as though he was a body builder. It was more like he was a furry male model, and from what she could see of the sheath between his legs, his penis was much larger then before. She would have been a bit turned on if Samantha&#39;s muzzle was not a picture of righteous fury.<br />
<br />
&quot;Samantha?&quot; Frances asked, picking up on her mate&#39;s anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s definitely a werefox,&quot; Samantha answered and slung William onto the floor as hard as she could, &quot;totally obsessed with sex and not loyal to anything but his dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Werefoxes can be rather loyal to their mates,&quot; Frances reminded her mate, &quot;maybe more sexual than other weres, but still loyal to their mates. And William here should still be adjusting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He tried to RAPE ME!&quot; Samantha hissed.<br />
<br />
Martha backed off, and wasn&#39;t sure as to be angry or to cry. Frances frowned at William&#39;s unconscious form but remained calm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was he in control of himself?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
Samantha blinked, but did little to hide her anger and begrudgingly said, &quot;No... but he did also reveal that he hasn&#39;t been loyal... Loyal would be the last thing that would define him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we should give him the option to explain himself,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;and it&#39;s Martha&#39;s duty to forgive or condemn him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine then,&quot; Samantha sighed, &quot;but do you have rope? I want him tied up before we dump cold water on him.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
William woke up  when he felt water hit his face, which felt longer than it had before. His body also felt warmer, but also restrained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up you PIG of a fox,&quot; he heard Samantha hiss at him.<br />
<br />
His eyes opened to see a very angry looking Samantha and Frances, both in their werecat forms along with Martha in her bathrobe. Martha didn&#39;t look happy, either, but she looked more hurt than anything else. He was also surprised to find himself wrapped up in rope. The last thing he remembered was leaving the bedroom to supposedly get some wine, but things got fuzzy after it. To his surprise, he found himself also rather fuzzy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what&#39;s going on?&quot; William said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You tell me, PIG,&quot; Samantha hissed, &quot;You cheated on your wife. You embarrassed the college dean by making it look like a coed was trying to rape you. You ran off with her to betray your wife and you tried to rape me when I foolishly came to rescue you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What... I...&quot; William began, remembering Yvette&#39;s attack on him, but he didn&#39;t try to seduce her. At least he didn&#39;t remember it. &quot;How...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I know?&quot; Samantha asked, &quot;I&#39;m the town chancellor. The college dean called me to report the supposed rape and your wife called to report that you had run off with the supposed rapist. I then went to save you, and you tried to rape me.&quot;<br />
<br />
William blinked as a few images of him facing Samantha head on and then getting his butt handed to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;She did try to rape me,&quot; William said weakly, &quot;It wasn&#39;t consensual... things really get hazy for me after that. She clawed me...&quot;<br />
<br />
William felt his ears go down submissively. Frances noted this and placed a reassuring hand on Samantha&#39;s shoulder. William&#39;s behavior was typical with regard these sorts of forced transformations. A fuzzy memory of the events once the transformation began to fully kick in and his body language was apologetic. Samantha sighed and looked to Martha, who still looked hurt. She then turned back to William.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that excuses your previous affairs or trying to rape me?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
William opened his mouth to begin to say something and then closed it. He couldn&#39;t escape it, and the hurt look on Martha&#39;s face hurt him. While the community college at Moon Lake had been the only one that would take him, he had tried to start over. To be better than he was in the past.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; William admitted weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Martha finally spoke, &quot;Why? I forgave you! I loved you! Why didn&#39;t you love me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; William admitted, &quot;I guess I was weak... but I do love you, Martha... Please trust me... the last incident... that made me realize just how wrong I had been and how easily I&#39;d been temped. I&#39;d hoped that coming here I could put it behind me... start over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha&#39;s face didn&#39;t change.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I failed,&quot; William continued, &quot;I nearly got myself raped and then attacked a neighbor...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t in control,&quot; Frances spoke up, &quot;You screwed up big time... but a good part of your actions tonight were more the result of trying to adapt to instincts being rushed into you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can only say I&#39;m sorry,&quot; William said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m just supposed to forgive you... again?&quot; Martha asked, some strength coming back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; William answered, &quot;but I don&#39;t expect that. I made too many mistakes in my past... and that vixen... only brought out the worst in me... I didn&#39;t want it... I didn&#39;t want to be a werefox... but still it happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could divorce you for this,&quot; Martha pointed out and then surprised when William gave a weak and said sounding whine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; William said weakly, &quot;I probably deserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
That caught Martha by surprise, as she really didn&#39;t expect him to agree with her. He looked up to her with red eyes with a slit pupil and looked sad, which further surprised her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do love you, Martha,&quot; William said weakly, &quot;I&#39;m bad at showing it... and I know I should have done better. But I love you...and... I wanted Moon Lake to be a new beginning. I still do... please...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha looked to both Frances and Samantha. Samantha still looked a bit angry at her rescue attempt turning into a fight, and Frances still looked conflicted over something. Strangely, though, she found all of them attractive. And William actually did sound honestly apologetic, something he didn&#39;t really sound like back in Minnesota. Maybe it was something about being a werefox, as the handbook she&#39;d read gave an indication that while werefoxes were extremely sexual creatures, they also tended to be loyal to their mates once they had a bonded mate, and William had been her husband for years and in that sense was a bonded mate. Maybe that change was actually bringing that about.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want a new start, William?&quot; Martha spoke.<br />
<br />
William slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine... this is your LAST chance,&quot; Martha spoke.<br />
<br />
William&#39;s ears perked and both Samantha and Frances looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Under specific conditions,&quot; Martha spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One, I can sleep with WHOEVER I want, man, woman, were, human, it doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Martha spoke, &quot;it&#39;s only fair, given the amount of loyalty you&#39;ve shown me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; William answered. Samantha and Frances actually traded smiles that William noticed, but didn&#39;t say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two, if I want you for a romantic evening, you can&#39;t get out of it,&quot; Martha continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Frances cut in, &quot;unless you become a were-beast yourself, Martha... sex would be out of the question, unless you WANT to become a werefox. William would pass the condition on to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha blinked for a moment and then sighed, &quot;actually... I&#39;ve been looking through a handbook that Nate got from your Ben... and well... let&#39;s just say, I&#39;m a bit more open to the idea of becoming a were-beast now... but more feline than anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to be a werecat?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d prefer it,&quot; Martha answered, with a nervous laugh, still hurt had how bad William had cheated on her in the past. But technically she had forgiven him for that, and he did seem truly apologetic now, and she was also a bit embarrassed, but decided to come clean, &quot;You two are beautiful... and I am bisexual... I tried to hide it after I met William... but I am bisexual, so it&#39;s not like becoming a werecat would change that in me. The handbook says that werecats are either lesbians or bisexual...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are,&quot; Samantha and Frances both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if it comes to any future children... the handbook said that any female children from a werecat would be werecats and male offspring would match their father&#39;s were-species,&quot;  Martha answered, &quot;so there&#39;d be no trouble with &quot;misshapen&quot; children...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No hybridization?&quot; Samantha blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not according to the handbook,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;You and Frances could both get pregnant and have biological offspring if you wanted it. Daughters would be werecats and sons would match their sire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; William said to Samantha.<br />
<br />
Samantha did her best ignore him and decided she&#39;d check that handbook when Martha was done with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And besides, William and I are old enough that we probably can&#39;t have any more children,&quot; Martha finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Frances commented, and rubbed up against Martha in a friendly way, like a cat greeting a sister, &quot;once you get your whiskers... you&#39;ll be looking to live close to between two hundred and three hundred years. We werebeasts have LONG life spans provided we avoid silver or decapitation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Martha mused and looked back to William, &quot;anyone, once I&#39;m a werecat and I say I want you... you come to me without question, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; William said slowly, &quot;I&#39;ll even share you with your friends here... if it&#39;ll make you happy and show you how sorry I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Samantha said to him, &quot;we might just take you up on that... if Martha is willing...but given that you foxes enjoy sex so much... you WON&#39;T get to see Martha&#39;s first transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; William said weakly, &quot;and I suppose I&#39;m to be on the couch for awhile...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet your tail you are,&quot; Martha answered.</p>
