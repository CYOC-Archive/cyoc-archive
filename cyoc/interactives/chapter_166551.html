<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up in a stark white room. Streaks of light and colourful spots dancing across your vision. Your whole body felt stiff. You found it hard to move, hard to speak, hard to think. The ringing in your ears started to subside, and you could hear a muffled conversation from the other side of the room. You heard someone speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems the procedure went perfectly.&quot;<br />
<br />
What procedure? Where were you? These voices sounded foreign, yet extremely familiar at the same time. Like meeting close friends after a long time. <br />
<br />
&quot;And what about the hypnosis? We&#39;ve never tried anything like this before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well as long as it had any effect then its fine. Our goal was to make the subject as obedient and oblivious as possible. Going overboard couldn&#39;t hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
You felt panicked, alarmed by the words you were hearing, yet somehow the words you were hearing weren&#39;t really being processed in your brain. You were on-edge, but you didn&#39;t know why. It was as if the words were being lost between your ears and your mind. You obviously weren&#39;t going to be able to understand anything through listening, so you tried to open your eyes. As this effort was only met by a blinding light, you decided to stretch out, then get off of the bed you were laying on. After much effort, you managed to move your arm, only to be met by curious and frantic conversation coming from those two mysterious voices. <br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s moving&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will she be able to manoeuvre her new body?&quot;<br />
<br />
Even though your brain was still filled with some kind of fog, you could still understand one word. She. You began to remember mundane things, like sitting in an office cubicle, getting stuck in traffic while going to work, eating a microwaved dinner before going to bed, but you also remembered another life. Laughing with your friends at the beach, checking out boys at the club, and picking out new dresses to wear. Then everything came back to you. The van. Those voices belonged to the people who had kidnapped you. No, those were your friends. You suddenly had a headache and tried to rub your temples, but you still couldn&#39;t move. Why were you so stiff? And why were they calling you she? After opening your eyes, everything became clear. Cold and metallic surgical equipment surrounded your bed. Stark white walls with no view of the outside world, and bright fluorescent lights lined to ceiling. Then you saw the two figures across the room. One in a doctor&#39;s outfit, and another in a grey suit. Both were female. You started to slide the blanket off you, causing chatter across the room. As your eyes adjusted to the light and you looked down, you were shocked. Two gigantic 32z breasts stood straight up on. your chest accompanied by two gigantic nipples and large areolae. Long platinum blonde hair fell in front of your face and as you tried to scream, you noticed your gigantic lips, dripping with drool. They took a while to get, 32 injections to be exact. You remembered going to the plastic surgeons office multiple times, but you don&#39;t remember getting any breast implants. While they were huge, firm, and round, they were still soft and seemingly natural. You finally sat up, and a mirror was lying in front of you. Two huge blue eyes accompanied by long eyelashes. The aforementioned lips accompanied by a cute button nose. Silky blonde hair going down to your knees. Your muscle mass was gone, and your body was much skinnier. A skinny waist paired with wide hips. A giant ass paired with giant thighs, and a wet, shaved, and meaty pussy where your penis should be. You looked to be about 21 and about 5&#39;7&quot;, a few inches shorter than you were before. You started to feel dizzy and lightheaded. As you grabbed onto the silken sheets, you noticed your knew two inch nails. The two figures across the room started to walk towards you. Your mind was fighting with itself, but despite that you knew that this was a foreign place, and you tried to run. That is until you noticed the guards stand outside of your room, looking intently at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please darling take a seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman in the grey suit gestured to two comfortable looking leather chairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;You may or may not know this depending on how the hypnosis went, but my name is Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
You remembered Mary, but you didn&#39;t remember your relationship with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, I had always yearned for a daughter, but unfortunately I am completely sterile, and I have a very specific list of the features I want in my offspring. We designed you using a heavily modified simulation of what my daughter would look like, and gave you new memories and a new mindset to match. As i&#39;m sure you remember your past life and have questions, let me answer them. We chose you because we knew that your living conditions weren&#39;t up to standard, and that nobody would miss you if you were gone. And before you ask, all of these changes are permanent, as per my request. I&#39;m going to give you the life you deserve. A carefree life as an ignorant and stupid girl. As it seems the mental procedures were not entirely successful, we&#39;ll have to take you in for more hypnosis sessions, and if that doesn&#39;t work then we&#39;ll have to try some other methods. Anyways darling, I&#39;m done with you for now, this man will lead you to where you need to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you looked to where she was pointing, you saw what looked like another bodyguard. Except with slightly different clothing and no helmet or goggles. You cautiously walk over to him, thinking of ways to escape.</p>
