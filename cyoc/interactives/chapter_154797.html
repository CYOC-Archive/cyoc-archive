<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun was low in the sky and casting an orange haze in the west when Vanessa opened the gate in the hedge-wall and pulled a dinner-cart into the pool-area behind her. She rolled the trolley up to the edge of the pool, and Chad quickly surfaced and pulled himself up onto the pavement. He drew himself completely out of the water, merman-tail and all, and peered at the silver dome of the patter-cover in anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s eager,&quot; said Vanessa with a cruel laugh. &quot;I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re hungry for a nice, big, juicy fish! Aren&#39;t you, Neptune?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad made a face, stuck his tongue out, and shook his head.<br />
<br />
Vanessa cackled and said, &quot;Just kidding. I know that pretty young idiot Paul fed you nothing but fish, and I thought you might like some variety. But first,&quot; out from under the trolley she pulled a white picnic-blanket and spread it out on the pavement. She set down a couple of pillows and one of the covered platters, and she took a seat on a pillow and patted the other one. &quot;Don&#39;t be shy. We&#39;re gonna be real good friends, you and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad took the cue and pulled himself onto the blanket, seating himself on the other pillow next to Vanessa. While he stared at the platter, Vanessa cuddled up next to Chad and said, &quot;You know, I&#39;ve always been fascinated by pictures of mermen and tritons. As far back as I can remember; ever since I was a little girl. So it&#39;s kind of like I&#39;ve been waiting for this moment all my life.&quot; She placed her hand on Chad&#39;s chin, and Chad was suddenly aware of some very long fingernails pressing into his skin. Vanessa turned his head so that he was facing her, and she looked into his eyes, searching. Chad tried to meet her gaze, but he was *really* distracted by thoughts of food. <br />
<br />
Vanessa glanced down at the platter, then said to Chad, &quot;Just a little kiss before we get started on dinner, m&#39;kay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad nodded, and Vanessa leaned in and kissed him. Chad felt no particular thrill from this—Vanessa wasn&#39;t by any means unattractive, in fact she was pretty damn good-looking for middle age, and she had a rocking body that would make anyone Chad&#39;s age judge her a &quot;total MILF&quot;—but neither was he feeling particularly repulsed by the idea that he was basically whoring himself out for a meal. At this point, he hadn&#39;t tasted real food in so long that there was no telling what he&#39;d be willing to do for just one bite of something that wasn&#39;t seafood.<br />
<br />
Vanessa, though, seemed positively giddy from the experience. After breaking off the kiss, she lifted the platter, revealing a salad. Just a salad, but Chad grabbed the whole thing and started stuffing his face with lettuce. God, it was like heaven after having gone so long without. Vanessa laughed at the way Chad greedily inhaled the first course of the meal; then she decided to cut loose and bring out everything else.<br />
<br />
Also on the dinner-cart were fruit, cheese, bread, steak with potatoes, and chocolate cheesecake. And with each new dish revealed, Vanessa elicited more and more intimate favors from Chad: kiss here, touch there, remove this article of clothing from Vanessa&#39;s body and fling it away. It was all a lot of teasing and playing around, and Chad could tell that Vanessa was doing this to ramp up her own anticipation of things to come. Each new dish from the dinner cart was an entire feast for Chad; but for Vanessa, the whole experience was serving as one big appetizer.<br />
<br />
By the time Chad was on dessert, Vanessa was wearing nothing but bikini bottoms and jewelry. Her breasts were perfectly round and perky, probably less than genuine in Chad&#39;s estimation, but he didn&#39;t really care either way, because the only kind of cheesecake he was interested in was the literal slice of the stuff on the dessert plate in front of him. There was a little cup on the side of the plate with chocolate-sauce for drizzling over the cheesecake, and Chad licked his lips in anticipation as he reached for it—only to be stopped by Vanessa, who said, &quot;No-no, naughty Neptune. That&#39;s for a different dessert.&quot; Then, surprising Chad, she took the chocolate away from him, hooked a thumb inside her bikini-bottom, and poured the dark syrup down the front of it.<br />
<br />
Chad stared. Vanessa smiled and raised one eyebrow. Chad looked from the slice of cheesecake, still untouched, to Vanessa&#39;s chocolate-smeared intimate bits, and sighed internally. It was time to pay for dinner. He managed to pull himself away from the dessert he would have preferred and set himself to the business of pretending to make love to his captor. Somehow, he just knew, if he didn&#39;t play along and please the witchy heiress, she would become angry with him, and bad things would happen.<br />
<br />
And so he embraced her, and kissed all over her body, lingered on her luscious lips, bathed her breasts in soft and succulent smooches, and caressed her clit and cunt. Vanessa didn&#39;t complain at all when he pulled off her bikini-bottom, placed his head between her thighs, tickled her taint with his beard, and ate her out with a feigned enthusiasm to rival what he actually felt for the dinner he&#39;d just had.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly soon, Vanessa came, and hard, with keening gasps that progressed to a long, sustained moan of climactic bliss. Her merman fantasy was partially fulfilled, being pleasured in this way by a fish-tailed god of the sea. &quot;And now, my darling Neptune,&quot; she practically sang like a siren, &quot;let me return the favor.&quot; She sat up, drew Chad seductively to her, and kissed him ferociously, hungrily, on the lips, the neck, the collarbone. <br />
<br />
Chad, to his annoyance, found that this was actually turning him on—a lot. He knew that he didn&#39;t care for Vanessa as a person; in fact, he was pretty sure that he didn&#39;t even like her. But she was a woman, sexy and confident, and (despite the fact that he was presently trapped in a 30-year-old merman body with no junk below the waist) he was still a hormonal 18-year-old football jock. So he actually started to loose himself in the sensation of Vanessa making love to him, as she moved down his body, lingering on his chest for a while, playfully kissing at his nipples, down his abs, down to his wast. She spent a good long while just kissing along the line where skin ended and scales began; it was kind of ticklish. <br />
<br />
Then Vanessa came to the spot where Chad&#39;s groin used to be, the belly of his fish-tail, and she felt it up and down with searching hands, and she kissed and licked it all over, and Chad could only writhe and wriggle underneath her at the futility of it all. &quot;Oh dear,&quot; said Vanessa at last, when she finally gave up on finding any evidence of Chad&#39;s manhood. &quot;You seem to be missing something important, my Neptune.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad looked into Vanessa&#39;s eyes and nodded solemnly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; she said. &quot;You don&#39;t have a cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s just no fun for either of us,&quot; said Vanessa. &quot;Hm . . . what to do, what to do . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad pointed at the enchanted seashell necklace that Vanessa had given him earlier that day, the magical item that allowed him to breathe air, and looked at the witch hopefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s going to have to involve magic,&quot; said Vanessa. &quot;But enchanting a necklace with an air-breathing spell is one thing. Rearranging your anatomy while still keeping you a merman is something else entirely. It&#39;s going to take time. And research. And resources. But I think it can be done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad perked up and used two fingers to mime walking.<br />
<br />
Vanessa cackled at that and said, &quot;Oh, no, my dear fishboy, that is *not* going to happen. I&#39;ll give you a cock to pleasure me with if you promise to be really, really good; but I&#39;m never going to give you legs. Then you wouldn&#39;t be my pet merman anymore, and what would be the point of that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s face fell, and he angrily swatted away the dessert-plate with the cheesecake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Neptune, don&#39;t be like that. If you&#39;re sullen and disobedient, you&#39;ll only make me angry. And if I&#39;m angry, I might just have to take away something I&#39;ve given you.&quot;<br />
<br />
A look of fear appeared on Chad&#39;s face, and Vanessa quickly changed her tune and said soothingly, &quot;Oh, my sweet darling, don&#39;t fret. Give me a day or two to work the magic, and soon I&#39;ll show you pleasures that no merman has ever known. I&#39;ll make a man out of you; you&#39;ll like that, won&#39;t you?&quot; Vanessa then kissed Chad and left.<br />
<br />
Once he was alone, Chad could only slide himself flipper-first back into the salt-water pool and ponder over what could possibly come next in the horror that his life had become.</p>
