<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>The first day of school was over. Oliver had seen some pretty digusting things. Kids had been eating out of garbage cans and one kid would pass gas every minute. </P>
<P>Oliver had to go to his dads new store after school to help him with unloading suplies into the store. Olivers dad owned the new hardware store in town. When they finished it was dark out and Olivers dad told him to go home and start on homework.</P>
<P>Oliver figured he would take a short cut through the woods. While in the woods he heard a noise in the bushes. He asked who was there. No one replied?? As Oliver moved close to the bushes something jumped out!</P>
<P>It was Jake. Oliver had seen Jake in school, but didn't say anything to him becuase he was to shy. Jake was the only kid that seemed to be normal in that school. </P>
<P>Jake was a well built kid. He was very muscular, well tan, and very hairy for a 15 year old. He had red hair, a couple freckles on his face and was about 5'9. Oliver asked him what he was doing in the woods at this time of night. Jake replied and said that he was looking for his dog. Jake had told Oliver that he lived next door to him. They both walked home together. </P>
<P>Jake told Oliver that he would IM him later on before he went to bed. They both walked torwards their house's and went in. </P>
<P>Olivers mom asked, How did school go? Oliver replied and said that alot of the kids at the school were doing wierd things and that the only ordinary kid was Jake who he had met in the woods. Olivers mom said that the kids couldn't be that weird. But Oliver told his mom that one of them started digging through the garbage during lunch. Oliver asked why their weren't any girls in his new school. His mom told him that it was an all boys school. </P>
<P>Olivers mom told him to get wash up and get ready for dinner. After dinner, Oliver was just geting started on his homework when&nbsp;Jake showed up on his IM.</P>

</P>
<P align=left>Oliver continued to finish his homework and then went off to bed.</P>
<P align=left>The next day at school Oliver met up with Jake in the hallway. Jake told&nbsp;Oliver that he would point out who&nbsp;everyone was and show him where things were. </P>
<P align=left>Thats Zac Route he's the captain of the football team and the most popular boy in school.&nbsp;You never want to get tackled by him. He tackles like a lion&nbsp;Zac was very tall, red coarse hair, long finger nails, and greenish yellow eye's. </P>
<P align=left>To your left thats the school bully Todd Macatee. He bullies everyone. Todd was around 6'0, a little fat, and has yellow but straight teeth. O yeah!!!! He&nbsp;eats like a pig and&nbsp;likes to take peoples lunch. </P>
<P align=left>Behind you is stinky Peat. His real name is Peat Marshall, but he stinks like a skunk and never takes a bath. Peat was around 5'10 with black hair, hairy all over, long finger nails, and smelled really&nbsp;bad. Oliver&nbsp;said that he must have been the kid that was passing gas in&nbsp;his class yesterday.</P>
<P align=left>Right next to Zac is Ryan&nbsp;Reptile. He has the dryest skin ever and peels it during class. He is the captain of the basketball team and he loves snakes. Ryan was&nbsp;6'4, greenish black hair, green eye's, long nails, and has a whisp.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left>After gym. All the boys went&nbsp;into the locker room to get dressed. Oliver could see&nbsp;red hair all over Jake's body when he took off his shirt. On the other hand when all the kids took off their shorts to put on their pants Oliver could see that they had large packages very large packages for their age.</P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left>Some of the boys in the locker room started messing around and slapping each other with towels. One kid smacked Zac with a towel and Zac&nbsp;growled at them showing his teeth and smacking him back. </P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left>Oliver's parents told him to invite his new friend Jake to sleep over. Olivers parents were leaving for the weekend and they trusted him alone. </P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left>Both Oliver and Jake&nbsp;played&nbsp;video games till the pizza arrived. They had order two pizza's. Jake had ordered a pizza piled in meet all over and wolfed it down like a pig. Oliver and Jake spent most of the night&nbsp;watching the new werewolf&nbsp;movie that had just come out on video until around 10pm. </P>
<P dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" align=left>Oliver decided to play&nbsp;hide and go seek with Jake. He new it was a childs game but they still had fun.&nbsp;Jake was so good at it. Oliver hid in the most darkest place in his house but Jake still found him. It was like Jake had night vision.&nbsp;</P>
