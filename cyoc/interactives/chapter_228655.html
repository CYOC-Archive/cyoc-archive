<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Is there a way back?&quot; Alex finally asked, looking over to Taki who was absorbed in stirring his stew.<br />
<br />
The tanuki simply shrugged. &quot;Dunno. I just know people sometimes show up here from elsewhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But isn&#39;t that magic? Don&#39;t you.. uh..&quot; Alex motioned at the leaf sitting on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have tanuki magic, sure. But that&#39;s only good for certain things. I&#39;m not a wizard or anything, and to cross worlds?&quot; Taki shook his head, his round ears drooping a little as he frowned. &quot;That takes some powerful mojo. I can introduce you to a wizard when we head into town, but he&#39;s more of a hedge wizard, you&#39;d need to go to one of the big cities for a real powerful one.&quot; Taki picked up a lid and covered the pot. &quot;An hour or so on the fire and dinner will be ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s stomach grumbled at the thought of food, reminding him he hadn&#39;t eaten all day. Taki just laughed at the sound. &quot;It&#39;ll be worth the wait, I promise.&quot; Then patted his belly. &quot;I didn&#39;t get this way from bad cooking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, uh, what magic can you do then?&quot; Alex asked, trying to distract himself from the rumbling in his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, make myself look how I want, like you saw, some illusions, some simple tricks, good luck charms..&quot; Taki shrugged. &quot;The shape changing is the big one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you can do more than that human disguise?&quot; Alex asked, picking up the leaf and twirling it between his fingers.<br />
<br />
Taki just laughed and nodded. &quot;I can do almost anything. Here.&quot; Taki popped to his feetpaws and wandered over to one of the potted plants on the shelves. He plucked a leaf free and held it up in front of his face. It glowed softly for a moment then he stuck it to his forehead where it disappeared.<br />
<br />
His fur began to retreat back into his skin, his tail shrinking away once more, which oddly made Alex a little sad. He kind of liked the fluffy appendage on the tanuki. But the skin that appeared beneath the fur wasn&#39;t the light tan Taki had been sporting when they met, instead it was a mossy green.<br />
<br />
Alex leaned forward, engrossed in watching the change. It wasn&#39;t exactly slow, but definitely wasn&#39;t instantaneous either, just long enough to really take it in. Taki shot up a few inches, then a foot, and then another until his head was brushing the ceiling of his den, his frame swelling in width to keep up. But it was almost all muscle, his arms and legs bulging with swollen mass and thick veins as his stomach melted away into rock hard cobblestones of a six pack. Even his chest pushed out, his nipples turning an even darker emerald green. His fur didn&#39;t seem to retreat completely either, leaving a thick pelt of black hair along his chest and stomach, and down around his cock which had gotten much longer and thicker. His balls were the same size as they had been, but looked smaller on his now larger frame.<br />
<br />
His muzzle shrank back into his face, his nose turning into an upturned snout as a pair of tusks pushed out from his squared bottom jaw past his upper lips. He kept not the stubble of his human form, but a thick black beard along his jaw, and his hair remained a shaggy mop but took on the same pitch black color of the rest of his hair. He flexed for, Alex, giving the same grin, though it was a touch menacing now with those sharp boar like tusks. &quot;There. Instant orc.&quot; HIs voice was now deep and gruff. Though he still had that playful mischievous twinkle in his eyes, especially as he looked down to Alex&#39;s lap.<br />
<br />
It was then Alex noticed he had gone rock hard at the show, and he felt his cheeks heating up as he tried to position himself to hide his erection, which only make Taki laugh more. &quot;It&#39;s alright, nothing I haven&#39;t seen before, or had myself.&quot; He took a seat, which now looked ridiculously small for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting..&quot; Alex motioned at Taki, not really sure how to put his thoughts into words. But the tanuki seemed to get the idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;You thought I&#39;d be short and stout? Nah, I just find it more comfortable to stick to a size and shape I&#39;m used to. If I wanted to be a tall skinny human like you I could.&quot; Taki shook his head as he leaned on the table, careful not to put too much weight on it to make it tip.<br />
<br />
&quot;And your um..&quot; Alex motioned at Taki&#39;s pendulous sack that swing between his spread legs. At least it wasn&#39;t so oversized looking, but it was still almost comical. &quot;Is that some sort of give away?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taki tossed his head back, his laugh still a bark but now loud and booming. &quot;Nah, I just feel weird when they&#39;re small. I dunno how you other races do it. Not having a good solid weight making you feel grounded. Actually they&#39;re a bit on the small side right now. But I kind of emptied them earlier today, give them a day or so and they&#39;ll be back to normal.&quot; Alex must have looked shocked at those words, since Taki just let out another laugh. &quot;Then again, if you don&#39;t empty them often enough, it gets hard to walk.&quot;<br />
<br />
This really was some weird world, here Alex sat listening to an orc who was really a tanuki talking about having to masturbate to keep his balls the right size. &quot;Really..&quot; He went on. &quot;That wizard friend of mine buys it off me, keeps some and trades the rest off to the big city. Tanuki jizz is a component in a lot of fertility charms and potency spells. Lucky me right? I basically make a living spilling my seed every few days. Though demand is starting to get higher than I can supply, and I&#39;m the only tanuki for miles.&quot; Taki just shrugged as if it was the most normal conversation in the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you lonely out here all alone?&quot; Alex asked, suddenly noticing the somewhat forlorn expression on Taki&#39;s face. The tanuki was not good at hiding his emotions, or else he just didn&#39;t care to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes. And eventually I&#39;ll go looking for a mate, but I&#39;m young yet, no rush. I only moved out of my parents&#39; den a decade ago.&quot; Taki said it like he just moved out on his own six months ago. Hell, Alex had only been on his own for two years now. Which made him think of his family and friends and the fact he&#39;d probably never see them again. But a large, strong hand gripped his shoulder, not too hard, comfortingly. &quot;Hey, I guess this has been a long day. If you want to lay down.&quot; Taki nodded over to the bed off to the side, it was round and big enough for two humans, and covered in soft pillows and blankets, looking more like a nest than a bed.<br />
<br />
Alex shook his head. &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to be alone with my thoughts right now.&quot; He tried to return a smile to Taki, an he knew the one he gave was a pathetic one. &quot;So these leaves?&quot; He asked, trying to change the subject and move his thoughts off in another direction. &quot;Do they only work for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and only once, I have to make a new one each time, or anytime I want to do a bit of magic.&quot; Taki waved to the shelves of potted plants. &quot;So I&#39;m also a bit of a gardener.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pity.&quot; Alex said with a laugh, picking up the leaf that Taki had shed with his human disguise once more. &quot;Looks like fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is. I take it for granted sometimes, but it really is.&quot; Taki replied, his good mood restored as Alex seemed to cheer back up. &quot;Though there are potions and the like that you can use for the same thing, not cheap and most of them wear off.. but it&#39;s something. There&#39;s even a brothel in Dicktin that specializes in providing you exactly what you want as long as you can afford it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded, just pressing the leaf in his hand to his forehead imagining what it would be like to...<br />
<br />
The moment the leaf made contact it felt like a bolt of electricity was coursing through his entire body. He felt himself going rigid, every muscle and join in his body locking up in an instant as he began to fall out of his chair. &quot;Alex!&quot; He heard someone say in a loud gruff voice. He knew that voice, who was it? He couldn&#39;t think straight. &quot;Alex!&quot; Who was Alex? Was that him. He felt himself falling, something big and firm caught him, wrapping around him. Everything went black.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Alex woke up in his bed in his messy apartment, his alarm clock showing 8:54 as daylight streamed in through between the slats of his blinds. &quot;Just a dream.&quot; He muttered. Of course it was a dream. Though he was sweat soaked and his sheets clung to him. Luckily he hadn&#39;t had a wet dream, he confirmed with a check of the sheets. He slid out of bed, his stomach rumbling for food. With a groan he dragged himself out of bed, making a quick pitstop at the bathroom before heading into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
He could hear the TV going, playing Saturday morning cartoons which his roommate Jason still watched religiously with a bowl of cereal. Alex liked those mornings though, seeing his gym rat of a roomie sitting on the couch in just a pair of athletic shorts, shoveling down a bowl of cereal. Too bad Jason was straight as they came, but he was sure his roommate knew Alex was gay and enjoyed teasing him by walking around barely dressed. Or maybe he was just an exhibitionist. And sure enough he could see the back of Jason&#39;s head over the back of the couch.<br />
<br />
Alex rifled through the cabinets, deciding to just have a bowl of cereal himself. But something stuck in his mind. Jason was a blond, and the he had seen a mop of brown hair. He almost dropped his bowl as he rushed into the living room, and there sitting on the couch was Taki, right out of his dreams and completely naked. But not a tanuki, or an orc. Human Taki. Short but solidly built, with his slight gut and big balls. He smiled as he looked over at Alex, his eyes twinkling. &quot;Hey, love. Wanna watch with me?&quot; He patted the seat of the couch next to him. Alex moved on auto pilot, sitting down as Taki laid one his arms across Alex&#39;s shoulders, firm and warm and strong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you wearing those?&quot; Taki asked, pulling at the waist band of Alex&#39;s pajama pants, pulling them down until his cock popped free, rock hard and drooling. He turned to look at Taki, eyes wide, only to have what he was about to ask interrupted with a long passionate kiss. A kiss that trapped his mouth even as he felt a hand wrapping around  his cock starting to jerk him off with long slow strokes. Alex forgot what he was going to ask as the kiss broke, and Taki moved his mouth down to Alex&#39;s lap, engulfing the entire length of his shaft in his mouth.<br />
<br />
Alex came, and the world shattered. His eyes snapped open and he was laying in a soft bed, in a room carved from the ground. Something warm was on his stomach and he looked down to see his own cum splattered across his torso. Then he saw Taki, tanuki Taki, seated at the table staring at him, somehow looking both concerned and amused. There were a bunch of books spread out and he had his hand resting on an open one in front of him, his ears and nose twitching. &quot;Oh thank the gods, you&#39;re awake.&quot; He said, popping to his feet quickly rushing over to sit on the bed next to Alex.<br />
<br />
Taki began running his hands over Alex, poking and prodding him. &quot;Well.. you seem whole at least.&quot; Then he leaned in for a sniff. &quot;And that magic is gone. Strange, that leaf didn&#39;t have any magic left in it, but as soon as you stuck it to your forehead. It exploded with it. I&#39;m sorry, that shouldn&#39;t have happened, I don&#39;t know what happened.&quot; Taki reached over and grabbed a cloth from a table, using it to begin gently cleaning the cum off of Alex&#39;s chest and stomach, there was quite a bit of it.<br />
<br />
Alex wanted to protest, but he was kind of enjoying being fussed over by the tanuki.  &quot;How long was I out?&quot; He managed to ask, looking around the room. The pot was still simmering over the fire, but things had definitely moved about.<br />
<br />
&quot;A day or so. I wanted to go get my wizard friend to come look at you but I also didn&#39;t want to leave you alone in case you woke up.&quot; Taki tossed the cloth into a pile off in the corner near a big tub he probably used to do laundry. &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually..&quot; Alex said, taking a moment to stretch. &quot;I feel like I had the best night&#39;s sleep I&#39;ve had in a long time.&quot; And he did feel full of energy, and not a bit groggy. He hopped to his feet, and blinked. Something felt off though, and it took him a moment to notice what it was. Something was tugging down. He looked down, and his balls were hanging a few inches lower than usual, not only that, they must have been three times their normal size. Taki&#39;s still dwarfed them, but for a human they were quite the pair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Taki said looking at them, rubbing his chin. &quot;That might be a side effect.&quot; The tanuki hopped to his feet and returned to his books, picking one up as Alex instead hefted his enlarged orbs in his hand. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what happened, but..&quot; He flipped a couple pages in the book. &quot;This is a book on transformation magic. I kind of skimmed this passage before when I read it, but it says those who come from outside our world are usually overly sensitive to transformational magics, responding to them in weird ways. I think the, um, swelling should go down eventually. Just the exposure to tanuki magic kind of.. rubbed off on you a little. It should fade.&quot; Taki paused and flipped another page in the book. &quot;I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex looked up from the examination of his own balls and laughed. &quot;Well, even if it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s not the worst thing.&quot; Fondling them felt good, better than good. It was almost like stroking himself off, even his cock began to respond, so he took his hand away, letting them sway a bit.<br />
<br />
Taki smiled at Alex&#39;s good humor about the situation. &quot;No, I guess not.&quot; Alex looked at Taki&#39;s massive pair, which indeed given the passing of a day had swollen even larger, though they didn&#39;t seem to be hampering his ability to walk much, they just bounced and swayed quite obviously as the tanuki bustled about. He had set down the book and was now serving up a bowl of stew he eagerly pushed into Alex&#39;s hands. His stomach practically roared the moment the smell hit his nose, and it was all he could do to take a seat at the table before he began devouring the meal.<br />
<br />
Alex looked up to meet Taki&#39;s eyes, who was staring at him with a somewhat dopey grin. Though he quickly hid it as his eyes met Alex&#39;s. &quot;I&#39;m uh.. going to go check on something.&quot; Taki bounced to his feet and headed to a door in one of the walls. &quot;I won&#39;t be long. Make yourself at home.&quot; He opened the door and disappeared through it, closing it behind him. If Alex didn&#39;t know better he&#39;d swear the tanuki was embarrassed about something.<br />
<br />
Alex set down his spoon, eyeing the door that Taki slipped through, curiosity ticking at the back of his thoughts. He really shouldn&#39;t, it wasn&#39;t his home and the tanuki was allowed his privacy, but Alex could swear he thought the tanuki might even want him to follow.</p>
