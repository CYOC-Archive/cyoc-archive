<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Quickly and effortlessly Sapphia adjusted her mannerism’s to more closely match Evelynn’s.<br />
<br />
“I could pose the same question to you, now couldn’t I Ms. Anderson?” Sapphia said as she sensually strutted in her leather boots slowly circling around the girl as she spoke.<br />
<br />
“I-I suppose you are right. But I wasn’t going to do anything delinquent, honest, I just needed some fresh air.” Tiffany said defensively. That was when she hear the door shut behind her.<br />
<br />
“Really? You didn’t want to break any rules? But you snuck out here breaking curfew; and you are breaking the dress code by not being in uniform when walking through campus. That does seem like delinquent behavior to me, perhaps you will need to be reprogramed.”<br />
<br />
Tiffany was now keenly aware that she was in her pajamas in front of the headmaster of the school. But that didn’t bother her until it was pointed out, she didn’t really consider what she was doing wrong until Ms. Streng pointed it out to her. Now she was second-guessing herself. Was she being a delinquent? A fog was slowly creeping over her mind.<br />
<br />
“What, What do you mean reprogramed?” Tiffany said fighting off a wave of dizziness.<br />
<br />
Sapphia smiled, this was too easy; slow nudges have pushed this girl right where she wanted. With the door shut no one would bother them and break the spell she was now weaving.<br />
<br />
“Well, Ms. Anderson, the best way I have found to deal with delinquents is to recondition them; to punish them and break them down to their base code and redesign them into something useful.” Sapphia was still talking but she was more focused on the spell, she was almost ready to deliver the final blow.<br />
<br />
What was all this talk about code she was fine her code was perfect, wait that wasn’t right she wasn’t some robot. As she thought of a robot the fog began clearing a little bit she saw her body; but it was different at her joints she could make out small seams. And her eyes, they looked artificial? They also had a vacant look to them.<br />
<br />
This was so weird that wasn’t how she looked was it? As she thought this her chest opened reveling wires and circuits everywhere with blinking lights her breasts were balloon sacks with a tube leading to where he lungs should be, but again it was just wires and tubes.<br />
<br />
This should be concerning but Tiffany bit her lip as a wetness began spreading through her crotch. Why was this so erotic? She was a good girl she should not take pleasure in seeing these corrupted mental images of a defiled version of her pure body.<br />
<br />
She tried to deny the feelings but the fog crept in making it harder to fight the feelings. Then a voice reverberated through the fog, it was Ms. Streng, but it began to change as she spoke to someone else, still a girl but no longer that of the headmaster of the school.<br />
<br />
“Now Ms. Anderson, we can both see who you really are. You want this right? This depravity?”<br />
<br />
“No!” Tiffany vehemently denied.<br />
<br />
“Are you so sure you don’t want this? Look at that body, you would be a good girl able to follow orders if programed; you could be a perfect version of yourself totally efficient no more struggling with PE or math your mind with be a computer you could calculate problems in your head and physical exertion? What a joke you could run until your power runs out; and yet you would be totally vulnerable to others finding your secret are you cheating or are you able to now compute things that were out of reach before. Were you slacking before or do you know the limits to how fast you could run? Will they find out that you are truly a robot on the inside? If they do what will happen? Will you be experimented on? Perhaps you would be disassembled to see how you tick?<br />
<br />
“No.” Tiffany was trying to fight it, this unknown entity that was toying with her. But her body was on fire. Did she want this? Her mind was screaming no, but her body was leaning towards the upgrade. She had stumbled upon some images some time ago of girls as robots fitting into society; they stuck with her. She was praying every day to be freed from these desires, she was pure she wanted a family and a husband, but what if her desires never leave her, should she really give up on them when she could experience the world through their eyes?<br />
<br />
“So be it, if its something you don’t want then I will take it away.” the voice said as the fog began to slowly cover the robot version in front of tiffany.<br />
<br />
“Wait!” Tiffany yelled, what was she doing?! Her mind screamed. Tiffany ran through the fog towards the robot version. The fog was covering it and tiffany was loosing sight of it.<br />
<br />
Finally the fog covered the robot completely right as Tiffany reached out to it, her hand grabbed nothing. She missed her chance; it was gone.<br />
<br />
“No! What have I done, I missed my opportunity.<br />
<br />
Her mind cleared up, the world came back into focus when an icon appeared in her vision<br />
