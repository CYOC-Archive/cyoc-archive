<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finishing dinner Sasha and Gloria paid their bill and got in their Uber. The ride home was uneventful and quiet as Gloria thought about her feelings for Sasha. Pulling in the two girls paid for the trip before looking Gloria’s house. “Sooo you want to come in,” Gloria asked. “Sure,” Sasha responded. “Besides pretty sure my dad would bug out if I walked in the house looking seven years older.”<br />
<br />
Entering the house Sasha immediately kicked her heels off sighing in relief. “Ugh how to girls wear these things,” she groaned. Gloria giggled as she looked down at Sasha’s feet. “I didn’t know you painted your toes,” she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Sasha looked down at her bare feet befor blushing slightly. “I was bored one night,” she moaned. <br />
<br />
“Blue though,” Gloria giggled.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t  want some girly pink color,” she whined trying to hide her toes. “And I was wearing socks before you changed my outfit. Now stop staring your making me blush.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Gloria laughed. “Their cute by the way. You did a great job on them.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks I think,” Sasha smirked. Making her way to the couch she now attempted to tuck her feet under self, which only caused her dress the rise slightly higher up her lef. Gloria grinned as she watched her friend try to adjust her outfit. “You know you look really cute when your all shy and awkward.”<br />
<br />
Sasha furrowed her brow as she looked at Gloria. “Don’t get to used to it,” she smirked. “And by the way what’s with you tonight. You’ve been more weird than usual.”<br />
<br />
“Wha....what do you mean,” Gloria stammered. Sasha sighed as she looked up at her friend. “Look Glo,” she sighed. “Listen you’ve....you’ve probably been my closest friend since I moved here. I mean we had a lot in common. We were both raised by single dads for a long time. I know you and Jackie are probably closer than we are but..your like my best friend.”<br />
<br />
Gloria sighed as she looked at Sasha. She needed to be honest with her, she might be crushing on Sasha and it could be awkward but it needed to be done. “Okay,” she said taking a deep breath. “This....this is going to sound really, really, stupid but....I like you.”<br />
<br />
“Okay I like you too.”<br />
<br />
“No I mean I like you. Like, like you...like you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Sasha said quietly. “Umm Wow um..”<br />
<br />
The girls now sat in silence as they tried to avoid eye contact. It was Sasha who finally broke the silence. “Um Gloria,” she whispered. “Listen...um...I’m flattered but I don’t like you like that. And...um I kinda have a feeling you may not either.”<br />
<br />
Gloria sighed as she thought about it more. This crush may be just that, she loved Sasha like a sister. She admired how tough and independent the girl was. Gloria had wished she could be like Sasha, her confidence in herself was amazing. Looking at the blushing girl she sighed sadly. “Umm maybe you’re right,” she said sadly. “Would it um be okay if I sat down.”<br />
<br />
Sasha smiled as she pat the cushion next to her. Sighing Gloria collapsed onto the couch only to have Sasha place her arm around her shoulder. “Soooo....what brought this on,” Sasha asked. Gloria shrugged as she looked towards the floor. “I don’t know,” she moaned. “I just...well...your like so confident and tough and independent. I wish I could be more like you I guess. Your just....so strong.”<br />
<br />
Sasha now laughed quietly causing Gloria to furrow her brow. “Sorry,” she smirked. “Its just hearing you talk like that it makes me laugh.”<br />
<br />
Gloria gazed curiously at Sasha who was smiling warmly at her. “It’s funny Glo because I feel the same way about you.”<br />
<br />
“Me,” Gloria exclaimed. “But I’m nowhere near as confident as you are. I mean your like the toughest girl I know.”<br />
<br />
Sasha sighed as she looked towards the ground. “You don’t give yourself enough credit,” she sighed. “Gloria seriously have you ever looked at yourself. Your gorgeous, you may not see but I certainly do. Your so smart, beautiful, your kind, and everyone loves you....whether it’s teacher said OR students.”<br />
<br />
Gloria gaped as she took all this in, she had never thought of herself like that. “Your joking right?”<br />
<br />
Sasha shook her head slowly before turning to face Gloria. “No,” she whispered. “No joke. You may not know it but a lot of people wish they could be like you....me included.”<br />
<br />
The two girls sat in silence, trying to find the words to express their thoughts. “You want to be like ME,” Glori whispered causing Sasha to nod. “Yeah Glo I wish I was like you,” she smiled. “You’ve got it all. An awesome dad, a stepmom that loves you, the coolest big sister ever. Your smart, caring, beautiful...sometimes I wish I was like you. Instead I’m just the tough girl that’s good at fixing cars and getting trouble.”<br />
<br />
Gloria watched as Sasha wiped her eyes sadly, she had never seen this vulnerable side of Sasha before. Tenderly she now lifted her face towards hers placing a tender kiss on Sasha’s lips. Both girls parted looking slightly bemused at what had occurred.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Sasha said blushing. “How was it?”<br />
<br />
Gloria furrowed her brow as she looked at her friend. “Weird,” she said. “Umm it was nice don’t get me wrong but um I don’t know if um I would uh...kiss you again.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I can kinda say the same thing,” Sasha said sheepishly. “I mean don’t get me wrong it’s not you but....um...I don’t think I like you like that.” Gloria nodded in agreement as the two girls blushed wildly. The silence in the house was deafening as the girls sat in awkward silence.<br />
<br />
“I’m a dork huh,” Gloria mumbled sheepishly. “NOOO,” Sasha said quickly. “No don’t you ever think that. Listen...I’m..glad you told me about this. Look, I...I think it’s really sweet the you like me so much that you would want to be my girlfriend but...um I don’t think you and me are like.....into eachother like that.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded sadly as she wiped her eyes. “Probably,”she mumbled sadly. “Ugh this sucks, I....really like you Sasha...I just don’t know how I feel about us.l.like that.”<br />
<br />
Sasha hugged her friend tightly as sniffed. “Yeah I got nothing either,” she sighed. “But hey, you got an older sister whose gone through this kinda thing before. Now might be the time to Well......seek some sisterly advise.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded as she looked at Sasha. “You might be right,” she smiled. “Besides I’m sure they would be happy to see you. I...I just have one question though.”<br />
<br />
“Sure anything,”<br />
<br />
“We’re still friends, right Sasha?”<br />
<br />
Sasha smiled as she hugged her friend tightly. “The best,” she whispered. Sasha now stood as she took her friends hand. “Now cmon we got some questions we definitely need answering.” Gloria smiled weakly as she took her friends hand and began to make their way towards the stairs.</p>
