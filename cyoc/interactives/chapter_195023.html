<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stripes stood in the the Freshman dorm&#39;s third floor&#39;s common room, clipboard in hand as he waited on his group to assemble, new students and their parents. He was a broad-chested stocky young man with a his &quot;Claw Valley College Orientation Staff&quot; tee tight across his torso, he also wore jeans and boots. He hated boots, shoes of any kind, really, but right now he didn&#39;t have much choice. The thing that stood out about him, and earned him his nickname, was the short mohawk he wore, alternating vertical stripes of black and bleach blond that had some of the new Freshmen smiling at him, and some of the parents eyeing him in annoyance. Like he could help how his hair looked. At least the new students would see why tomorrow once their parents were gone and the school slipped back over to the other side.<br />
<br />
Behind him, a large bank of windows that went up all the floors of the dorm, gave the common rooms a spectacular view of the valley&#39;s teardrop shaped lake and the forest around. It&#39;s where the valley got its name, to the usual residents the lake looked more like a claw than a drop. The school was naturally close to nature, and students whispered the valley was more than just a regular old valley. That much was clear from the get go, but there seemed to be something alive about it, and not just the fecund greenery. <br />
<br />
The students that began to trickle in were a mixed lot, he never had managed to figure out how the admissions board picked them. This was his second year as an RA and they always seemed to be such a random bunch, but he knew each and everyone one of these new arrivals needed to be here, whether they wanted what was coming or not, and almost all would accept it. He got a sneak peek at their files and personality tests, and started putting names to faces via the sticker nametags everyone wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are those strange contraptions across from the showers?&quot; He heard one woman asking her husband, though loud enough for others to hear. Her son gave his parents a bit of a wilting stare. Stripes chimed up, since it was his job to answer questions. &quot;Full body air dryers. Like those ones for hands, except.&quot; He motioned up and down his whole body with his pen. &quot;Helps save on towel usage and grey water from laundry. We&#39;re a fully green campus, we even get our electricity from the local hydroelectric dam and the solar panels you can see on pretty much every roof.&quot; Every word true. Those full body dryers were also necessary to get a coat of fur dry in any decent amount of time. Not that he could share that part. Yet. Nor would the Freshmen need it right away.<br />
<br />
Stripes did a quick headcount and checked it against his list. Some of the faces in front of him he had already met, others he&#39;d get around to. But it looked like he had the full group. &quot;Okay! Let&#39;s get started! First of all, my names is Stripes and I&#39;ll be one of your RAs this semester.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stripes? Really?&quot; Asked one of the parents in an annoyingly haughty tone than made Stripes want to rearrange his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s actually Stephen Abernathy the fourth, but Stripes is easier. Even college approved.&quot; He said, tapping his nametag with his pen, making the plastic click. That got a least a few chuckles. &quot;As I was saying, I&#39;ll be one of your RAs, Max the other one will be showing up in a couple days. Those are our rooms.&quot; He said, pointing to the two rooms right off the common room. &quot;Come to us if you need anything, even if it&#39;s just to talk.&quot; Actually, Max and him tended to share one room and use the other for a game and study room, but the parents didn&#39;t need to know that.<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, a few ground rules. Students are allowed to go anywhere in the Valley they want. Including the lake, the hiking trails and into town. With the town, we suggest sticking to the shops and entertainment on Mane St.&quot; It was a good joke when they got it. &quot;And keep their presence on the residential streets to a minimum. Anyone wanting to leave the valley needs to submit a form with the residence office. It&#39;s a good trip to the next town and we don&#39;t want to lose anyone.&quot; Not that the Valley would let anyone go it wasn&#39;t done with. He kept on with the basic rules of the college, interrupted occasionally, especially right after, &quot;Please observe the dress code in the student manual while in public areas..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How necessary is it to tell us all this?&quot; One parent spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like warning labels.&quot; Stripes said with a small smile. &quot;If I&#39;m putting emphasis on it, there&#39;s a reason. Now.. the quad fountain is not for swimming, bathing, or laundry..&quot; <br />
<br />
The tour of campus was much more interesting, of course. It wasn&#39;t a large campus, but it did have an air of age to it, with sturdy brick buildings covered in ivy, towering trees dotting he campus, and even a boat house right on the lake usually cared for by the rowing team. &quot;There&#39;s a lifeguard on duty from sunrise to sunset, so swimming in the lake is allowed and encouraged, the gymnasium has an indoor pool for when it gets too cold.&quot; Some students practically had to hit the water everyday after all. Their instincts demanded it.<br />
<br />
The fact that they had separate lines in the cafeteria for vegetarian and meat eating students had some of the more progressive parents nodding in approval, and got eyerolls from some of the others. &quot;How many vegetarians can you even have on campus?&quot; One of the complainers muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite a lot, actually. I think the area, um, attracts a certain kind of person. I eat off the vegetarian line myself.&quot; Stripe&#39;s nose wasn&#39;t as sensitive as it normally was, but the smells wafting from that side of the kitchen as they cooked dinner still had his mouth watering. Smelled like the broccoli gratin was going to be on the menu tonight.<br />
<br />
The tour rounded back out at the dorm, and he gave the parents the clear but firm reminder that they had agreed to leave town by ten o&#39;clock this evening. Most would leave right away, intending to get dinner in the next town over. Some found the requirement odd, Stripes knew the truth behind it of course, but they just told the parents that research showed a quick break caused less emotional distress improved bonding with their classmates. Really, they just didn&#39;t want any of them getting caught in the school&#39;s magic.<br />
<br />
Stripes sat in his dorm as the the freshmen settled in, said their goodbyes, and some went to explore or get dinner. His cellphone rang and he checked it before answering with a smile. &quot;Max! I wasn&#39;t expecting a call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I wanted to see how it&#39;s going. How are our new cubs doing?&quot; As always, the call was staticky across the boundary, but it was good to hear his roommate and boyfriend&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be interesting. This year has a few, um, characters. Others seem like they&#39;ll be easy to bring in.&quot;  Stripes eyed his door, which was slightly cracked so he could keep an eye on things outside, but he spoke low enough it would have taken superhuman hearing to eavesdrop, and none of the students currently on campus had that. Yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for tomorrow morning&#39;s freak out?&quot; Max asked jokingly.<br />
<br />
Stripes just snorted. &quot;No. I wish you were here to help. No.. no.. don&#39;t apologize, I  know you couldn&#39;t be. Grayson promised to be here first thing to help them calm down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grayson? Tell fish-breath I said hi. Well, I&#39;ll get there as soon as possible. Better hang up before these long distance charges go crazy. Love you, Stripey.&quot; Max said, he never got tired of hearing it though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love you too, Chuckles.&quot;  Stripes hung up the phone and slid over to nudge his door open more. He remembered what it was like waking up his first day of Freshman year, seeing all the faculty and older students walking around on hooves or paws, or whatever else they had. He had never been scared, some student were, but not him. He had been excited. Then when his own changes started a week later.. well.. He ran his hand along his mohawk. He would be glad to be back to normal tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Stripes woke the next morning to the sound of a shout. Had someone noticed already? The light was still a bit dim out his window. He turned and looked at his clock. 7am. Well, no time like the present. He sat up and rested his weight on his returned hooves and stretched, his black and white striped hide right back in place where it should be. One glance to the closet mirror and he smiled. &quot;Hello, handsome.&quot; He said to the muscled zebra in the reflection. He quickly got some shorts on and trotted out to meet the freshmen for real, they&#39;d still be human of course. They&#39;d need to find themselves before they began changing,  but that was a problem for later.</p>
