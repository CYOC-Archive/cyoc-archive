<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As November rolled on, Darren and his friends found themselves slowly adjusting to the past. After meeting once more with Fukushu, the group began to reestablish the ties they had in the future. Slowly, those bonds were reforming, which now led to an event none ever saw coming. A Thanksgiving dinner within the kingdom of the kitsune.<br />
<br />
Tatsu understood the importance of these teenagers from the future befriending Fukushu and Abolith. This was why he agreed to Darren&#39;s request for the group to get together on Thanksgiving. It would allow Fukushu an opportunity to become acquainted with his future student as well as mend fences with his former protégé Akira. What the lord of the kitsune wasn&#39;t counting on was the traditions humans had on this American holiday.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a Packer,&quot; Tatsu asked as he, Akira, and Fukushu gazed at the football game on the TV Darren created. &quot;I believe they are some sort of factory worker,&quot; Akira replied as he studied the television carefully. &quot;Then a Lion should easily defeat them in battle,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;I fail to see why this would be considered a sporting contest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its football,&quot; Ewart replied enthusiastically. &quot;And those are just names. It&#39;s not actually a factory worker and a lion in battle. Don&#39;t you know what football is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sporting competition is the distraction of children,&quot; Fukushu scoffed. &quot;And an actual battle would be more entertaining. Why would the defense not eliminate the opposing teams best weapons? Tactically it would make the most sense if they wish to win this contest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Intentionally injuring one&#39;s opponent is against the rules,&quot; Akira stated. &quot;I am still unfamiliar with this..football but I&#39;ve have seen the students of my school engage in this activity. The intention of the sport is to prevent the opposing team from advancing to the other side of the field.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren could only smirk as he listened to Ewart, Akira, Tatsu, and Fukushu debate the game. For the three militaristic kitsune, they viewed the game as if it were a battle. Ewart, on the other hand, tried to explain the rules. The only problem being when the announcers began to commentate on the game useing words such as battle. &quot;They still don&#39;t get it do they,&quot; Misaki asked. &quot;Not even close,&quot; Darren chuckled. &quot;And I think its driving Ewart crazy.&quot; <br />
<br />
The former couple laughing as they now made their way towards an adjacent room. Stepping inside they could see their friends as well as Shizen, Ayami, and Abolith preparing a meal. When Darren suggested this feast, Shizen and Ayami both volunteered. As a bonus Steph was now assisting, however, the amount of food was becoming overwhelming. Intermixed with the traditional Thanksgiving fare were favorite dishes of the kitsune. Darren himself wasn&#39;t quite sure what they were and had little luck even pronouncing the ones he did. All he could tell was that they were traditional Japanese dishes and they smelled amazing. &quot;You need any help,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Gail now looked up, a thin line if sweat on her brow from where she had been making mashed potatoes. &quot;I think we&#39;re good,&quot; she said. &quot;Unless you want to help Neela and Hannah take what&#39;s done out to the table?&quot; Darren nodded, grabbing a few dishes as he made his way towards a rather large banquet table. The celestial kitsunes decided to keep the gathering small, slowly bringing their eldest son back into the fold of the kitsune community. Considering this was the first Thanksgiving the kitsune ever had, Darren was amazed with how much food they had prepared. &quot;So Neela must be nice having the holiday off,&quot; Darren said as they placed the side dishes on the table. &quot;I got lucky,&quot; Neela replied. &quot;It just happened to fall on my day off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how is work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird,&quot; Neela replied. &quot;I mean I love my job but it&#39;s so weird dealing with the technology now. Sometimes I feel like it&#39;s the freaking Dark Ages.&quot; Darren stifled a laugh, remembering a particular incident between Neela and Dr. Julia Harris-Moreland. When the more experienced Julia instructed Neela to proceed with a procedure that was deemed inefficient in the future, the teenage doctor protested. &quot;Yeah I heard about the fight you got in with Dr. Harris,&quot; he smirked. &quot;What was it you called it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said she should just use leeches okay,&quot; Neela groaned. &quot;Its not my fault medicine is so primitive in the past!&quot; Darren laughed, causing his friend to grumble as they made their way to yet another room. Inside the group could now see Raiden and Sachiko gazing at their infantile selves as Stella and Pam fed them. Since returning to the past the kits, as well as their parents, were trying to adapt to the situation. Needless to say it was proving difficult. Both sets of parents were still adjusting to parenthood, leaving the interactions with their kits from the future awkward. The parents were trying but it was proving to be a strain. That and it was weird for the kits to see infantile versions of themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe we were ever so little,&quot; Raiden said in awe as he stared into the eyes of his past self. &quot;I do look cute though,&quot; Sachiko added as her infant self cooed softly. Both infants now rested in the arms of Pam and Stella, the two teens rocking the kits as they tried to put then to sleep. &quot;Make sure that Raiden is wrapped tightly,&quot; Abolith stated, the elf nervously looking over her child. &quot;And if he begins to feel warm give him this. It&#39;s an elven remedy to lower fever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby relax okay,&quot; Stella sighed. &quot;Raiden is fine. I know how to care for a baby.&quot; Abolith fidgeted, unsure if she could trust her infant with this girl. &quot;Mom was I sick alot as a baby,&quot; Raiden asked. Now Abolith began to fidget nervously looking at the future version of her son. So far her interactions with the kit had proven amazing. Raiden was polite, good natured, and appeared to have grown into a son she could be proud of. Still, it was odd to her for the boy to ask questions when she was only truely beginning to adjust to parenthood. &quot;No,&quot; she said softly. &quot;No you&#39;ve been very healthy. I....I just worry that&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dinner is ready,&quot; Robbie called. The group now making their way towards the table. Taking a seat, Darren now watched as Steph and Hannah assisted in bringing out the rest of the food as the others took a seat. As Tatsu made his way to the front, he paused as he looked out at his assembled guest&#39;s. &quot;I&#39;m not quite sure what I should say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can help,&quot; Darren stated. Tatsu simply nodded, inviting Darren to the front as everyone now gazed at the teen. Clearing his throat, the Catalyst now gazed at the people he had grown to rely on over the last year. &quot;So,&quot; he said nervously. &quot;Umm usually when we do this at my house. We kind of give thanks for everything good that&#39;s happened over the last year. I think for us though, I want to give thanks for being able to all come together and hopefully creating a better future for us all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here here,&quot; Hannah cheered, the monkey Soul Drive now shifting into human form as she raised her glass. &quot;Now let&#39;s eat! I&#39;m starving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have to eat at the table do we,&quot; Pam asked. &quot;I know in my house my dad usually goes to watch the game. I was kind of hoping I could do that too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a wonderful idea,&quot; Shizen stated as she now picked up her plate. &quot;I would very much like to see what this human tradition of football is like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can show you grandma,&quot; Raiden said excitedly. Shizen smiled, letting the excited kit take her hand as she followed him to the other room. As everyone now began to mill about and talk, Darren took a moment to appreciate what was happening. The future still needed to be saved but at least for today he could enjoy a meal with his family and friends.</p>
