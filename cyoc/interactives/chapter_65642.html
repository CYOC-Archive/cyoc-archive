<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Becky giggled as she rocked back and forth on Candy, enjoying the hard wood between her legs and the feeling <br />
of her breasts pressed against the wooden back of the horse. Her regressed mind didn't know why it felt good <br />
and didn't really care, either; all that she cared about was that it did feel good and she had found a way to <br />
make it feel better. As her both of her new personalities found some satisfaction - her little girl mind <br />
pleased at riding the rocking horse and her horny side receiving pleasure - Becky seemed to remember the game <br />
at hand. The details of it were fuzzy and she was distracted by the feelings running through her body and her <br />
giggling but she seemed to remember she could make the other people on the stage look or act like something <br />
else.<br />
<br />
As she pressed herself even harder against the rocking horse, squealing in pleasure, she peeked over at the <br />
lady with ugly feet and the boy who was down next to them. He looked like he was sniffing them and seemed to <br />
be enjoying himself. Becky thought he kind of looked like a doggy the way his butt was in the air. She tried <br />
to picture him with doggy ears and a tail, but her mental image kept changing as her horny personality wanted <br />
to imagine him a certain way, too. Finally the two parts of her mind seemed to agree and Becky giggled again <br />
at the thought, not realizing that she had cast a spell towards David.<br />
<br />
The Peter Pan costumed boy was enjoying himself as he licked and sucked Tory's huge, hairy toes. He hoped the <br />
other team would make them leathery or stinky, and definitely even bigger. His cock was half-hard in his green <br />
tights and that led him to start thinking about Tory jacking him off using her meaty toes. He moaned around <br />
the digits in his mouth in pleasure and heard the sound echo above him as Tory enjoyed his attention in spite <br />
of herself. Pleased, David wiggled his bum in the air. A bulge appeared at the base of his spine and with a <br />
soft pop, a brown furry tail sprouted from above his ass and began to wag.<br />
<br />
The sound caught Tory's attention and she looked down in her haze of pleasure, surprised to see a wagging <br />
tail. But this wasn't the only change she noticed. David's ears had moved up the side of his head and become <br />
pointed and furry, twitching on the top of his head. The nails on his hands had become pointed and black and <br />
if she could see his toes in his pointed green shoes they would look the same. His nose was black and wet and <br />
his eyes had lost their whites, instead being the dark brown of a dog. David's tongue lengthened and flattened <br />
as she watched and she gasped as its rough texture lapped at her sensitive feet.<br />
<br />
Still David wasn't done yet. His basic canine changes finished, Becky's horny mind's changes kicked in. <br />
Without really understanding why, Becky had imagined that a big, strong boy would be really nice to look at. <br />
David's muscles bulged, straining against his green tunic and tights as they grew. His sleeves ripped as his <br />
arms thickened. His neck became thick, his chest widened and barreled, and between his legs his hardening cock <br />
grew longer and thicker, looking obscene where it strained against his stretchy tights. When he was finished, <br />
David resembled a muscular stud with doggy features and a wagging tail that would not stop.<br />
<br />
Becky couldn't take her eyes off of him. She rocked back and forth, rubbing her crotch against Candy's wooden <br />
back and giggling and squealing. She liked this game a lot, she decided.<br />
<br />
Sean, meanwhile, was able to see some of this but it was a bit like looking through water. He wasn't entirely <br />
sure what had happened to David but saw that he had grown and seemed to have gained a tail. So, using his mind <br />
to send a mental command, he targeted Tory for the other half of the transformation, the one that would change <br />
her mind.<br />
<br />
Tory looked down at David and smiled. He was at her feet, where he belonged. She felt different, powerful, but <br />
liked it. David was her pet, she realized. His only purpose should be to do as she pleased, to serve her in <br />
whatever way she desired. She thrust her foot at him, causing him to gag as her toes were pushed down his <br />
throat, and the sound and sight of it made her laugh.<br />
<br />
'If you want him to change just let us know,' Sean said in her mind, able to communicate thanks to Kylie's <br />
promise that no matter the form each player would be able to respond. 'I'll make him anything you want if you <br />
turn me back into myself again.'</p>
