<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the older boys left Eric Anderson&#39;s bedroom so he could have some privacy calling Julie Stovall back, Ben Twist said to Nate Anderson, &quot;I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m still feeling a bit hyper from taking on Yvette to just kick back and relax at the moment. Want to go for a run in the woods?&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; said Nate, as he closed his bedroom door behind them. &quot;But first I&#39;d like to call Alex and see if he&#39;s available for... anything.&quot; If it was possible for a fully furred werewolf to do so, Nate would be blushing right now as he picked up his cellphone from the remains of his clothing on the floor and called his boyfriend.<br />
After bringing him up to date on the situation with the rogue were-vixen, Alex said, &quot;Sure stud. Where?&quot;<br />
&quot;Come to think of it, where do you live?&quot; asked Nate, before giving Alex his address.<br />
&quot;Wow. I&#39;m closer than you think. You have some open woods out back of your house, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;My folks&#39; house is bordering the same strip of forest, but on the opposite side of where you are,&quot; revealed Alex.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said a surprised Nate. &quot;I can meet you on top of the hill between us. Say, twenty minutes or so?&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re on! First one there gets to take the other however he wants!&quot;<br />
&quot;Deal. Just so long as the loser gets equal time afterwards.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got it. See you soon!&quot; said Alex eagerly, before hanging up.<br />
&quot;Well, I guess you&#39;re all set for the evening,&quot; said Ben, while Nate grabbed what he was now calling his werewolf backpack, with a fresh change of clothes and a few other essentials. &quot;I&#39;ll just have that run before bedtime, since tomorrow is a school day. Got anything I can put my stuff in before we part company?&quot;<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Downstairs, a couple of overturned chairs and a busted vase was about the extent of the damage caused by Yvette Smith&#39;s home invasion. Martha Anderson and Frances Twist set the chairs right again, while William Anderson got a broom and dustpan from the kitchen to sweep up the vase shards. All were still in their furry forms, since there was no time to strip out of their now ripped clothing to shift before squaring off against Yvette.<br />
As William took the dustpan back to empty in the kitchen, Martha grabbed Frances and planted a deep, passionate kiss on her fellow werecat as their breasts rubbed together. &quot;God, I&#39;m so horny right now,&quot; confessed Martha, as she wrapped her tail around Frances&#39;.<br />
&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; admitted the other woman. &quot;There&#39;s something about fighting for what you believe in, let alone achieving victory, that is so... stimulating. I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d like to come back to our place and...&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; said Martha, while teasing the lower lips between Frances&#39; legs with one paw. &quot;But considering what we just accomplished, I think tonight should be William&#39;s. However, if you and Samantha would like to make our duet a quartet...&quot;<br />
<i>What?</i> thought Frances. <i>I know Martha is bi, but is she actually suggesting....</i><br />
A brief flash of memory from having seen William Anderson&#39;s semi-erect werefox phallus gave her pause. The Twists certainly were no virgins, having played with plenty of &#39;toys&#39; together over the years among their lesbian activities, but to actually experience a live one directly...<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Frances. &quot;Even if I could talk Samantha into such an... excursion, being lesbians, neither of us have ever gone on the birth control pills for werecats. Considering how fertile us weres are...&quot; <i>Although if William was to give one of us a daughter... <b>NO!</b> That&#39;s my parents&#39; hangup. Let them find grandkids somewhere else.</i><br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay honey,&quot; said Martha, while holding both of Frances&#39; paws in hers. &quot;It was a silly notion, but I didn&#39;t think it would hurt to ask. If not tomorrow afternoon after my job interview, the three of us will get together tomorrow night for sure,&quot; she added, before kissing Frances right on her werecat nose.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be looking forward to it. But tonight, I guess I&#39;ll just have to ravish Samantha all by myself,&quot; said Frances. A thought that made both werecats smile.<br />
<br />
William, being a were himself, had overheard everything in the kitchen. As a loving husband and a life/mate bonded werefox, he swelled with pride that Martha was thinking of both him and them. However, considering he had agreed to an open marriage for Martha&#39;s sake to make up for all his mistakes over the years, the man within the currently vulpine body could not help thinking about having sex with either or both of the Twists.<br />
However, the mention of the werecat birth control pills gave him pause. While she was taking hers because they had agreed to wait, at least for the foreseeable future, if anyone was going to have his kits, it would only be Martha.<br />
<i>Someday. Maybe. But for now, it&#39;s best to take things one day at a time and show my wife just how much I love her. Even if that means having to share her with others,</i> he thought to himself, before putting the broom and now empty dustpan away. Then William rejoined the ladies in the living room.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Having informing him that Eric Anderson was still human, the mayor promised Samantha Twist that he would do what he could on his end to expedite matters so while in proper police custody with no hope of escaping again, Yvette Smith would do what was necessary to complete Jenny Harper&#39;s induction into were society.<br />
With all her business out of the way, Samantha put up her cellphone and reentered the Anderson house just in time to hear the last part of her fellow werecats&#39; conversation.<br />
&quot;I guess I&#39;ll just have to ravish Samantha all by myself,&quot; said Frances.<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s a promise I&#39;ll make sure you keep the moment we get home,&quot; said Samantha, as she wrapped her human arms around Frances&#39; furry body and kissed her wife right on the feline muzzle.<br />
&quot;Okay moms, get a room,&quot; kidded Ben as he came bounding down the stairs. &quot;I&#39;d like to go for a run and try to get rid of some of this pent up energy before bed, if that&#39;s okay with you?&quot; he asked, while Nate came down behind him to ask his parents the same basic question; although Nate didn&#39;t mention what his actual plans for the evening were, considering he was still &#39;in the closet&#39; as far as his folks were concerned.<br />
&quot;Okay, but be back by eleven,&quot; said the ladies, almost in unison. &quot;Tomorrow—&quot;<br />
&quot;Is a school day,&quot; said the teenagers, before walking out the backdoor. Ben had borrowed an old travel bag of Nate&#39;s for his belongings. If anyone had bothered to look, they would have seen both boys running and howling to the top of the hill outback, before Ben took off in a different direction and Nate was met by another werewolf, who took Nate&#39;s paw in his and led him back down the opposite side of the hill.<br />
<br />
After a couple of more minutes of conversation between the two families, the Twists said their goodbyes and wished Martha good luck on her job interview tomorrow, before parting company for the night.<br />
&quot;It looks like it&#39;s just the two of us now Mrs. Anderson,&quot; said William, as he embraced his wife.<br />
&quot;What did you have in mind Mister Anderson?&quot; she asked before kissing him. While being with her sister werecats had its advantages too, Martha didn&#39;t know which was better at the moment, feeling his furry body next to hers, or the sensation of his werefox cock growing larger as the top knot appeared from its sheath as it began rubbing against her very wet vagina lips.<br />
But before William could verbally or physically answer the question, Eric came running down the stairs. He had his cellphone open in one hand and was hollering, &quot;MOM! DAD! Julie wants to know if we can come over to their place sometime?&quot;<br />
Not wanting to disappoint Eric and possibly hurt his budding romance, both weres turned to look at their son as William asked. &quot;Sure. When?&quot;<br />
&quot;Tonight?&quot; asked Eric in return, before handing them the cellphone.<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; said a female voice on the other end, waiting for a reply.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Sundown was a minute before six that night. Jenny Harper and Harry Jenkins, the newest werefox of Moon Lake, had no way of knowing that they had been at it sexually for almost two solid hours. Now the fiances and newly life/mate bonded couple finally paused to catch their breath and rest a bit. Neither one knew that because of her incompleteness until Jenny could have her much needed encounter with the rogue Yvette, her were-vixen sex drive would be springing them back into action soon.<br />
&quot;WOW!&quot; exclaimed Jenny, as they cuddled within each other&#39;s arms. Her vagina felt empty without him inside, for the top knot had finally relaxed enough for his new werefox penis to slip out of her very wet home for it, but there was still something truly special about holding her soul mate.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; agreed Harry, nuzzling her with his new werefox muzzle. &quot;Where did you learn to—&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just part of being a werevixen now. Surely you&#39;ve noticed some new instincts and insider knowledge to who and what we are now.&quot;<br />
&quot;I sure have, like this,&quot; said Harry, before he moved one paw down and started rubbing her furry tummy.<br />
&quot;That feels...&quot; Jenny started to say, before she shuddered and came again.<br />
When she came back to her senses, she said, &quot;I&#39;m getting hungry.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. Because I have some snacks in one of those bags,&quot; said Harry, reluctantly leaving the king sized bed and going to the far corner of the hospital safe room, where he left the plastic bags he brought in with them.<br />
&quot;Mighty cute ass you&#39;ve got there Mister Jenkins,&quot; said Jenny, eyeing Harry&#39;s gray furred rear and bushy fox tail.<br />
Harry wiggled it all for her before coming back to the bed with a couple of bags of potato chips and some bottled water. &quot;To us!&quot; he said, before clinking his bottle against hers.<br />
&quot;To us!&quot; agreed Jenny, before practically drinking her bottle down in one gulp.<br />
With that, she got up to use the bathroom as Harry asked, &quot;Did you mean what you said about staying in Moon Lake?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; confirmed Jenny, before announcing that all the bathroom had was a small sink, toilet, and a shower.<br />
&quot;Maybe we can take a shower together in the morning before we leave here,&quot; suggested Harry, with a smile on his muzzle.<br />
&quot;Maybe we can book this room for our honeymoon,&quot; said Jenny, before kissing her fiance again. &quot;Now then. While I have what appears to be a brief moment of clarity before I go into heat again, let me explain a couple of things,&quot; she added, before telling Harry about her strict parents and their rigid upbringing and archaic child raising methods. &quot;They were very firm believers of &#39;spare the rod, spoil the child&#39;. While not at the same time, all of us children got switched at least once a week, whether we actually deserved it or not.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s terrible,&quot; said Harry, while holding her again.<br />
&quot;The only reason I even got to go to college, besides working my ass off to earn a full scholarship so they couldn&#39;t complain about the expense, is that thankfully they don&#39;t believe in the old adage that a woman should only be barefoot and pregnant. While mom has always behaved subservient to dad, they both had to work for a living to make ends meet and raise a family, and do acknowledge that the best jobs nowadays require a college degree.&quot;<br />
&quot;So they&#39;re not completely in the dark ages.&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Jenny, as she began to rub Harry&#39;s tummy. &quot;But I could never date in high school. They&#39;d read any boy who even looked at me the riot act about staying pure and chaste until marriage. When I graduate, they expect me to come back home, find a job, and then settle down, probably with whoever they approve of, if not pre-selected for me. But I look at Moon Lake as my escape. I wasn&#39;t expecting this,&quot; she said, holding out a furry paw, &quot;or these,&quot; she added, briefly caressing her new, larger bosom. &quot;From the moment I left Alabama to come here, I swore I&#39;ll never go back there again! I was hoping to find someone special, or at least a job here after graduation. But now I have the best of everything!&quot; exclaimed Jenny, before kissing Harry again, intensely mashing her furry body against his.<br />
&quot;Then in that case, how do you feel about Halloween?&quot; asked Harry, after Jenny finally broke the kiss to breath again.<br />
&quot;For what?&quot;<br />
&quot;Our wedding.&quot;<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s only a couple of weeks away,&quot; pointed out Jenny.<br />
&quot;I know, but it seems kind of appropriate, and I meant every word I said to you. I DO LOVE YOU JENNIFER HARPER! And I want to be with you for the rest of our lives. The sooner we can make it official, the better.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then Halloween it is Mister Jenkins,&quot; said Jenny with a sexy smile, before she mounted her fiance again.<br />
She moaned in pleasure as the top knot of his werefox penis penetrated her inner recesses. A part of the were-vixen within her couldn&#39;t help wondering how the night would have gone with one or both of the men Akane no Tachibana had offered to ease her &#39;suffering&#39;. Thankfully no one ever commented on the moisture that had started to form between her legs when the Skulk leader had made the offer.<br />
And she still wasn&#39;t looking forward to spending time with the rogue female to complete her transformation. That was just a necessity. It might be a pleasurable one, but still just a necessity.<br />
Yet if being with the one she loved and was engaged to was &#39;stress&#39;, then Jenny planned to endure the so-called agony for the rest of her furry life. She blushed at the thought of actually having an orgasm right there in the hospital hallway as she saw Harry running towards her.<br />
<i>Harry Jenkins is my life, my love, my all. Bonded soul mates until the end of time,</i> Jenny thought happily to herself, as she leaned forward to offer Harry her bountiful bosom as she rode him to mutual bliss and beyond.</p>
