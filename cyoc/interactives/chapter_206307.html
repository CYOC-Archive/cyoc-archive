<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And my path took me back upstairs. I ascended them gingerly so that the quakes and feelings which made me embarrassed last time were more reserved. The bra I wore was putting in work and what felt weird previously was something I was slowly starting to adapt to.<br />
<br />
The possibility that they might get bigger under the light of what my benefactor gifted me made me feel flush. It was interesting and crazy and alluring and totally impossible I would ever do that. But considering I could just put it back, I was torn. Messing with Beatrice‘s body even though it was also mine felt like an affront. Plus it wasn’t the worst thing to occasionally slip into a distant awareness of breasts. If they were much more pronounced, would I ever be able to overlook them?<br />
<br />
Beatrice‘s thing was being cutely gothic with a petite, small presence. I had already been changed so much by slipping into her role. To change her from that essential presence felt bizarre. But I told myself it was just messing around for a little bit. Additionally, if I was going to transform other people in so many ways, especially very girly ones then it was only right to test it out on myself for the experience.<br />
<br />
By the time I made it back to the dorm room, I was resolute in what I was going to do with the flashlight. Norah and her boyfriend were still on the couch and Norah was braiding the mile of hair that flowed over her shoulders and to her butt. The poor former guy had a defeated expression. I waved to them and asked what was up.<br />
<br />
Norah totally lamented that I had stepped out because they had just watched the coolest videos and they gave her lots of ideas for Luke. I couldn’t remember if I got his name before but I didn’t worry about it. I found a spot next to the shimmering twinkles of the lights strewn across the walls and diffused by the drapes between them. It was like dousing me in rainbows.<br />
<br />
Luke flicked some of her hair back and mentioned, “I wish you were as interested in finding a way to turn me back as doing all this stuff to my hair.”<br />
<br />
I sat up and relayed the information, “There’s actually no way to turn back. It’s permanent. I ran into the entity that caused all this to happen. They left a note downstairs. Every student is a girl.”<br />
<br />
Luke shifted and took a big swallow as she glanced down at her self and over at me. She huddled close to some ember of optimism. Was I absolutely sure? Was it just a claim? What kind of entity?<br />
<br />
Of course, I couldn’t be absolutely certain and I didn’t know much about my benefactor other than they could write letters. Luke looked a little woozy but steadied herself. Norah had a bit to say about transforming the entire campus. “Seems a little overzealous. There’s decently less than half boys anyway”<br />
<br />
I wanted to segue into sharing about what I was given but not quite yet. Rather, I referenced the original proposal. What if you could change anything about your appearance which didn’t change your sex?<br />
<br />
Luke lamented that she couldn’t just switch her sex. Norah alluded to all the fun the new girl could have with her sex. Luke dipped her head and kept quiet. Norah had plenty of things she would change even though I considered her practically perfect as she was.<br />
<br />
She thought her face looked bitchy and vaguely androgynous in a tomboy librarian way. She also wanted a much leaner belly, sexy thighs, and a more versatile voice. Perfect eyesight was a given and she wasn’t certain on her boob size but she definitely wanted to be bigger than Luke because she found that annoying. Luke emphasized that he would gladly trade with her.<br />
<br />
When I slipped in a trial balloon of imagining whether this mysterious entity made changes without anyone remembering like Norah wildly speculating if she had been changed before, I put forth the idea of if you could have changes without remembering them or if Luke was just made into a total girl, what would they think of that?<br />
<br />
Norah’s immediate reaction was that that would be so boring because making Luke squirm and blush about all this gave her life. Looked like I would be making a prolific use of the AA option.<br />
<br />
I joined in for some of the video watching as Kasey came over to air pop some popcorn for us. Rhea also lingered and took an affectionate shine to the new girl with a couple of braids and added plenty more.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I snuck out and went over to the sinks next to the shower for some privacy. Setting the option on the flashlight was the most challenging prospect because it felt embarrassing to just say boobs or bust or beauty. Femininity in particular seemed too vague. I wanted to do it right. As a faint joke, I offered up “peak Beatrice actualization”. It waited a moment but actually accepted it.<br />
<br />
When I thought of that prospect, I imagined Beatrice with as much beauty realized as possible. As many innate Beatrice qualities exemplified and distilled. I said it specifically to “more” with as much light covering my entire… my… entire body as possible. I waited with my eyes squinted shut as weight, softening, and stretches flexed their way all over, as though providing a massage that reached deep inside.<br />
<br />
This continued for quite some time until the vibration and feelings plateaued. I waited several seconds longer and then finally clicked off the flashlight. That done, all I needed to do was open my eyes and see the results. It took a little while to build up resolve but eventually I did it and gazed at the reflection that greeted me.<br />
<br />
My God… The woman before me, my reflection, had hair much like Beatrice but it dipped past her shoulders with a delicate shine. The same clothes I put on were also worn by her. In some places it looks like they had modified to adjust to the new curves, in others it looked like the clothing just endured. Beatrice’s narrow, dainty shoulders had a sculpted meat to them which emphasized their softness with a plush refinement. Her nails weren’t quite claws but had a solid and shiny extension with a delicate touch of acrylic.<br />
<br />
Her subtle shape that stretched with a faint dip around her waist before the rise of her hips was stretched seemingly at the limit. Her tiny waistline dipped in and then shot out with voluptuous hips emphasized by an absolutely pendulous behind that fluttered up and teased through the skirt. Beatrice‘s legs didn’t feel or look fat but rather enthusiastically feminine, for lack of any other words I could think of.<br />
<br />
Of course, I would be remiss to overlook the most blatant feature added. Beatrice now had breasts with a mile of cleavage expressed through the top and traced by the fabric. Beatrice could even make Brian jealous now assuming that new girl wanted what she received from my benefactor. And her face. It had a sculpted precision and slope less roundedly cute and more strikingly flowing.<br />
<br />
It was intense all around. Setting my legs together with the new shape wrapped my flesh around and against sensitive places and managed to play them like an extra pair of limbs. Just shifting in place, I felt like I could achieve the most intense sensations. It was all perfect and incredible but… it was not Beatrice.<br />
<br />
Far be it for me to judge the girl within me or the girl I could become on surface qualities but Beatrice didn’t feel innately like a voluptuous, curvy busty Goth chick who needed custom bras. Not that I was complaining about the soft jiggly contours I could carefully manipulate on my chest. Perhaps that would change given several hours of sustained gravity or trying to sleep comfortably. But I liked everything I’d been given. The idea of ownership of the most basic qualities of Beatrice and her cuteness felt more scintillating and uncertain than all the crazy additions. These massive boobs were easier to swallow as somethings separate.<br />
<br />
Yet I set the light to magnify the inherent Beatrice qualities. This had to absolutely be Beatrice but through the filter of some funhouse mirror that exaggerated everything. How could I even return to normal Beatrice shape? Did I really want to? This was peak Beatrice. Nervous tears streaked my face as I took a breath and struggled to work out how to undo this.<br />
<br />
With frail hope and uncertainty, my brain told me it was obvious. If the flashlight recognized magnifying Beatrice qualities then it would understand what I meant when I asked it for original Beatrice, the one only touched by my benefactor. Bracing myself, I put forth that thought and felt a crush of relief when it accepted it.<br />
<br />
Moderating the output of light, I stretched this chaotic reflection back into order. The leggy curves fell away for something scintillating but cute. I preserved a slight stretch of the hips to best playoff the qualities of the skirt. A slightly thinner waist was a little more than vanity. But I brought back Beatrice’s the original face. Not because I feared that everyone would notice a difference but instead because it felt more like my face and I didn’t want to lose it. Beatrice‘s dainty arms returned but with a faint luster of the other girl’s skin. And call me what you like but I saved an ever so slight addition to Beatrice’s bust.<br />
<br />
The heightened curve, especially in this top, seemed almost imperceptible but I noticed the altered heft and shift with my footfalls. A slightly scarier jiggle for Beatrice’s bra to manage on the steps. But gradual enough that I suspected and hoped that no one would see anything more than a different bra put on to maximize what I had. It was a relief but also exhausting.<br />
<br />
I had no idea that shining a light on Beatrice‘s body could sap so much energy. When I got blasted by my benefactor the first time, I felt mostly energized even though a shower was pleasant to follow. Perhaps it was from the refinement of my look? Perhaps my spirit and brain were wearing out from all this addressing of the elephant in the room and linking together who I was with Beatrice? Seemed like an excuse.<br />
<br />
I am Beatrice. Permanently. I am this goth girl from now on. This was home. I did a little crazy do it yourself remodeling which I then reverted for some minor corrections. My spirit freaked out for just an instant at such uncouth and forward claims of ownership. I was a boy, just a common boy. How dare I presume to have anything to do with the lady such as Miss Beatrice! But the notion now seemed silly. Quite a shift.<br />
<br />
The terror and uncertainty wasn’t gone. I just fortified myself against its worst symptoms. Oh you think you’re stuck with the guest appearance of a pretty girl? You are the girl. Remember how the girls you liked felt too close and yet too far away with mystery curves, alluring fragrance, and a presence that excited all the hormones inside you like water in a microwave? You are now everything mysterious and exciting from back then. Boys will sneak a peek at you and you get to show them all the mysteries with just a little light.<br />
<br />
It kind of came and went in waves. The realization and prospects of being Beatrice overwhelmed and swamped and tugged at every emotion I could feel. But leaving the mirror and returning to the dorm quieted all the anxiety and left curiosity for how to tint it. Seeing the exaggeration brought the truth into focus. I wasn’t a big titty curvy goth, I was subtle but beautiful Beatrice. And every word that complemented her had to apply to me despite the wriggling uncertainty and doubt of accepting such playfully flowery sentiments as reality.<br />
<br />
I still had a lot of work to do but it was wonderful to recontextualize what it meant to be Beatrice. I was still freaking tired though.<br />
<br />
Leaving the sinking mirrors behind, I did a little quiet stretching and flexing in the hopes that all the movement might shake loose my lethargy. It didn’t. Well, instead of trying to fight it off, I resolved to just embrace being a sleepy slug. Popping over to the bedroom, I found a nice set of pajamas with black cats and silvery moons set against a deep purple landscape. The top made it faintly obvious that I’d given myself a little bit more to show but I told myself it was still a subtle alteration.<br />
<br />
Returning to the living room, all my of roommates were present and accounted for in front of the screen enjoying silly videos. They had Luke boxed in and it appeared Norah was especially amused by that. I cuddled up in a blanket off to the side and giggled with them. </p>
