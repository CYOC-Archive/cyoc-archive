<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My eyes snapping open, the dream I had been having slipping away so quickly it makes me wonder if I had even been dreaming in the first place, I lay there, looking up at the ceiling, wondering what it is that awoken me. Next to me, I hear even breathing and with a start, I realise that there is somebody sleeping next to me. Then a wave of nausea roles over me and rolling out of bed, slipping my feet into a pair of pink slippers on the floor, noting that the digital read-out on the clock by the bed reads 7.07, I hastily head for across the bedroom to an open doorway that I can see leads into a bathroom.<br />
<br />
Quietly closing the door behind me, I hurry to the toilet and leaning over I begin to spew up contents of what appears to be a meal from the previous evening, catching my hair as it slides into my vision but before it could suffer the same fate as the toilet. After a bit, the nausea lets up and standing, I stumble to the sink and begin to splash cold water on my face.<br />
<br />
After a couple times of doing that, I straighten up and peer into the mirror, taking in the woman staring back with grey eyes that have just a hint of blue and auburn-hued hair that falls just a little ways past her shoulders. Letting my gaze wander, I see that I am wearing a loose-fitting pink tank top and a pair of tight pink stretch pants. Something of the dream comes back to me and gently pulling on the hem of the tank top, noticing that it and the pants are sewn together, wondering why, I instead push down on the shoulder straps, exposing my breasts, which I note are rather sore and tender and that the fabric that just slid past them left an uncomfortable feeling when it had brushed past them.<br />
<br />
Cupping them, feeling the erect nipple against the palms of my hands, I drop my hands after a couple seconds, the sore and tender feeling keeping me from holding them to long. Turning my attention to the outfit I am wearing, I continue to push down on it and when gravity finally takes over and it puddles to the floor, I step away from it, naked and shivering a bit in the early morning cold and facing the mirror, I take in my naked form.<br />
<br />
As I trail a hand down my abdomen, starting just below my breasts, a dislike of the sore and tender feeling keeping me from touching them, I let my hand drift even further down to my mons pubis, tracing the thin and barely visible outline of pubic hair, my mind trying to come up with some answer as to what is going on as the last thing I remember is being in a department store and trapped in the body of a little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey? You all right,&quot; a male voice calls out, breaking into my thoughts and squatting down to pull back on my clothes, the idea of getting caught naked by a guy causing me to nearly bash my head on the sink, I call out, &quot;Yeah. I'll be out in a minute,&quot; as I stand, pulling back on the one-piece garment.<br />
<br />
Exiting the bathroom, I head back to the bed where the person I had heard breathing earlier is now sitting up and going through the items on the night stand on his side of the bed. As I climb back into bed, he turns to me and asks, &quot;Everything all right?&quot; to which I nod and explain, &quot;Just a bit of nausea. I'm sure it will past,&quot; as I slip back beneath the sheets.<br />
<br />
Cuddling closer, the man slides his arm under my arm and cupping my breast, he asks, &quot;When's your doctor's appointment?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shifting so that his hand isn't pressing the fabric against my sore and tender breast, I mumble, &quot;I have it written down,&quot; sure that I do, but unsure as to why I had a doctor's appointment, but at the same time, hoping it had something to do with the way I suddenly feel.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure everything is going to be fine,&quot; the man says as he presses closer, his penis erect and pressing against me through the fabric of his pyjama bottoms.<br />
<br />
Finding that I actually like the feel of his hard penis pressing into me leaves me speechless for a moment and after a bit I mumble, &quot;Hmmm,&quot; in what I hope sounds like a tone of contentment, thoughts drifting through my head as I want him to do more than just spoon with me, sore and tender breasts be damned.<br />
<br />
Shifting about, I turn so that I am facing him, and laying my head against his chest, liking the smell that is coming off of his body, feeling flush and hot, I reach down and slip my hand inside his pyjama bottoms. Grasping his erect member, I begin to run my hand up and down as I tell him, &quot;Make love to me,&quot; suddenly feeling both amorous and insecure, as if my body is betraying me. And then, as he hugs me closer and begins to kiss me, I give myself over to pleasure as, for the moment, I forget my worries of not being able to remember anything that led me to where I am now.<br />
---<br />
He had gone to work and I now find myself alone, which I think might be a blessing as it now allows me to attempt to sort out what is going on as I now realise that the last thing I remember is a security guard helping me to find my mommy. Sitting down at the vanity, wearing nothing but a cotton robe that I do not even bother to close, I compose myself and start going through the contents within.<br />
<br />
When I have gone through all the contents in the vanity, and still have no new clues, I rise and head across the room, peeking in the dresser and closet as I go, taking in the clothes, seeing what I obviously wore day to day, finding my mind automatically pairing items together so that there is a colour scheme and each items matches and compliments another. When I exit the bedroom, I self-consciously close the front of my robe and heading through the house, I take in the information around me, learning more and more about who I apparently am and who the man is that I just had sex with and feel so comfortable around.<br />
<br />
According to my driver's license my name is Andrea Sworinski, I stand five foot seven and weigh about one hundred and twenty three. Finding a calendar in the kitchen, I piece together that my age is about twenty eight and from a couple diplomas I find in an office area, I am a high school and college graduate, specialising in computer software, which, judging from the mess around the computer, I design at home.<br />
<br />
When I find the day planner about one hour after I began my search, I learn that I have a doctor's appointment, the first at one three this afternoon. Paging through it, finding it goes back several years, I note that I had another doctor's appointment about three weeks ago and searching further, I find it had been for a confirmation of pregnancy. Setting down the day planner, I mutter, &quot;I'm pregnant,&quot; as I absently run a hand over my abdomen and then hug myself in a self-conscious fashion, a voice whispering in my mind that this is what I wanted, not to be stuck in the body of a little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;But even if that were true,&quot; I think. &quot;How did I go from being a little girl to being a twenty eight year old college graduate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling confused, I sit down in the office chair and curl my feet up underneath me and stare out the window, a feeling of nausea washing over me, but not bad enough to send me racing for the nearest bathroom as I attempt to force myself to remember how this had all come about. After a couple minutes, something comes to me and standing, I walk across the office and shifting a couple books, I expose a section of the wall, which I rap my knuckles against.<br />
<br />
As the section I am tapping on swings forward, numbers flash through my head and when the hidden safe is revealed, I automatically punch numbers into the digital display and listen as something within makes a thunk noise before I turn the handle and open the safe.<br />
<br />
Peering inside, I see various odds and ends and taking out an album of pictures, I pause, and then also extract a box something in my mind tells me contains jewelry, mostly family heirlooms from my mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and great-aunt. Returning to the chair, I set the box down on the desk and start with the album first. Paging through it, I find pictures of me growing up, some looking like the girl I swear I had turned into when in the department store and before I can become to confused, I flip through, knowing that there is something very specific towards the middle that I am looking for.<br />
<br />
And then I find it. Pictures of my wedding, along with a wedding certificate stating that I had been married for nearly five years now and that the man I had woken up next to had been one Carl Sworinski. Feelings of contentment, bliss and happiness wash over me and before I realise what is going on, I feel myself crying, but unsure why, only thinking that the day had been so beautiful.<br />
<br />
Closing the album, tears still running down my cheeks, I sniffed and reaching for a Kleenex, I turn my attention to the box as I first blow my nose and set the album aside. Opening the box, I see earrings, necklaces and bracelets, some sporting diamonds, emeralds or sapphires set in them, but what gets my attention is the amulet at the bottom of the box. Taking it out, I begin to examine it closely, unable to quite make out what the picture on it is, but sure that the word Zulo is printed on one side.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is important. It is why all of this has taken place,&quot; I silently tell myself as I dangle the amulet from my fingers, watching as it slowly moves back and forth, struggling to figure out how it is important and what it did to bring me to this point.</p>
