<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve is a college student. He thinks he&#39;s lucky to be dating Helen, one of the most wanted girls at the university. Her long black hair was smooth and silky, big E-cup breasts, smooth skin and a body in excellent shape thanks to her routine physical workouts.<br />
<br />
Their relationship was okay, at least that&#39;s what Steve thought. One day while waiting for Helen at the meeting place arranged for their date, he got a call from her canceling the date saying she wasn&#39;t feeling well. Being understanding of her condition he simply went back to his house. The next day he met his girlfriend, who was already fully recovered and acting normal, but just a few days later she started acting strangely. At first she started wanting to be alone for a while, then this time when the two spent each other was gradually increasing, until Steve could barely have a moment in the company of his girlfriend. She always said she had an appointment with one of her friends, so he didn&#39;t worry too much, but when he came across one of her friends while shopping and chatted with her Steve learned that Helen had lied most of the time she said she would go out with her friends, just as this friend he met suspected that there was something wrong with her.<br />
<br />
Helen had been acting weird for a few weeks now and, knowing she was hiding something big enough to make her lie to him like this, Steve decided to confront her. At the end of another day of school he invited her once more so they could go for a walk together, and once again Helen said that she already had an appointment with one of her friends, saying goodbye to him and heading in a different direction.<br />
<br />
Steve pretended to believe it again, but this time he followed her without her realizing it to see where she was going. He followed her until she entered the ladies room, so he stayed around waiting for her to leave to continue the chase, but she didn&#39;t come out anymore. Little by little the place became deserted, leaving him standing there alone in the hallway, which made him enter the men&#39;s room and wait hidden near the entrance.<br />
<br />
The silence was complete, which made it clear that there was no one else at the school, yet he continued to wait patiently. After 20 minutes of waiting he heard someone&#39;s footsteps coming out of the ladies room, so he looked outside and saw that it was Helen, who was currently walking away.<br />
<br />
Steve thought it was very strange that she spent so much time in the bathroom, but he had to know what was going on. Taking advantage of the fact that the two were alone, he left his hiding place and, starting to walk towards Helen, said &quot;Helen, why were you in the bathroom so long?&quot;<br />
<br />
Helen froze in place, then turned around and said &quot;Steve? How funny to meet you around here at this time, I thought you had already gone home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t make a fool of yourself, I think it&#39;s about time for you tell me the truth.&quot; Steve said<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Steve, saying these things makes it sound like you&#39;ve been thinking I&#39;ve been lying to you.&quot; Helen said<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you are lying. Your friends have told me that they haven&#39;t even seen you after several of the times you said you had an appointment with them, and you spent too long in the bathroom, enough to make you even more suspicious of something wrong. Don&#39;t tell me you started using drugs?&quot; Steve said<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I would never wear those things. If it really was that I wouldn&#39;t be doing anything to hide it, especially from you.&quot; Helen said without thinking, covering her mouth as she realized the words that had come out of her mouth<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew you had been hiding something from me. I thought we had made it clear that there would be no secrets between us.&quot; Steve said<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t ask anymore. Leave things as they are. If I tell you you&#39;ll be disgusted with me and I could never stand it if you dumped me.&quot; Helen said<br />
<br />
&quot;Knowing you&#39;re lying is worse. Please tell me the truth.&quot; Steve said<br />
<br />
Helen stared at Steve, then tears started to flow into her eyes and she finally said &quot;I... I was affected by the Dicksprout virus. Now you won&#39;t want to be with me anymore thanks to what I have between my legs now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve was taken aback by the revelation. He knew that his girlfriend was a carrier of the virus and that it could manifest itself in her at any time, but now that it happened he didn&#39;t know what to say or do for her. He had already heard that there were many of the affected ones who kept their conditions a secret out of fear, thus understanding how difficult the situation must be for her, who was now crying, standing in front of him. He instinctively hugged her, and she hugged him back, hiding her face against his chest while crying.<br />
<br />
In their tight embrace, Steve could feel the package that now filled her panties through her skirt. He knew they were supposed to have a very important conversation.</p>

Where do they Steve and Helen continue their conversation?</h3>
