<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sure... there is plenty for us to catch up on,&quot; Moe said slowly and let Nichole and Karen walk in.<br />
<br />
Daniel smiled and let them in. Moe and his family entered and were soon following Daniel along toward what Moe assumed would be Daniel&#39;s dinning room. He thought that Daniel actually looked younger than Moe thought he should look, though Moe privately wondered if this all related to the rabbit hole his family had apparently fallen down. Daniel&#39;s wife walks along with Daniel for a way until they came to a nearby hallway. Moe glanced as she headed off, and he actually heard Francine called to Daniel&#39;s son Peter. A part of him was still a bit numb with all of this, as he had gone to high school with Daniel and remembered being Daniel&#39;s best man when he and Francine married and that wedding didn&#39;t happen at Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, Moe...&quot; Daniel said slowly as they entered the dinning room, &quot;I know a lot of this is big and surprising... and I&#39;m sure you probably think I&#39;ve tried to mislead you... but it really isn&#39;t so bad... and you&#39;ve been a good friend to me. The stories you&#39;ve told me about the Gambonis going after Karen and making you move around the country... I couldn&#39;t let them get at you. You will be safe here in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell us you&#39;re all a bunch of furry freaks?!&quot; Nichole demanded with some venom in her voice.<br />
<br />
If Daniel was hurt by the comment, he didn&#39;t show it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a secrecy issue, Nichole,&quot; Daniel said slowly, &quot;I mean... before the Town Chancellor explained things... what did you know about were-beasts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They transform under the full moon,&quot; Moe answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re mindless beasts bent on consuming human flesh,&quot; Nichole added.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re largely beasts,&quot; Karen finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... if I told you to come to Moon Lake and said that most of the town were were-beasts and you somehow believed me... would you have even come at all?&quot; Daniel then asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most definitely not,&quot; Nichole said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And would you have told others? Like the government,&quot; Daniel asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Moe admitted, &quot;If only to... uh... save you from being attacked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s the fear every were here has had,&quot; Daniel explained, &quot;humans and were-beasts have never gotten along. Humans have hunted were-beasts and killed them in what amounted to the proverbial witch hunt. Some normal humans were probably even executed under the accusation of being were-beasts. And today, considering movies, if all the world knows about us... we&#39;d be attacked and killed or put in cages under the perception that we&#39;re mindless beasts out to eat human flesh. Which is no where NEAR the truth... and before you ask, but couldn&#39;t I trust you... you also just admitted that you would have exposed us... so no... without some measure of keeping my family safe, no I couldn&#39;t trust you with that secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moe was quiet and ushered Nichole to a seat at the table. After a few moments a question did come to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why, Dan? Why does at least one of us have to become a were?&quot; Moe asked. &quot;Couldn&#39;t we... sign a waiver or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It relates to the town&#39;s secrecy and all that,&quot; Daniel answered, &quot;and it&#39;s an old law, and one that I don&#39;t think anyone in Moon Lake is going to get rid of any time soon. College students from outside of Moon Lake and people that come into Moon Lake from one of the other nearby towns sign waivers in order work here or attend college... but they&#39;re also going to be in rather controlled environments and likely aren&#39;t going to be in a place when they&#39;d see us in our were forms. People that move to Moon Lake will at times see us and the fear is that you&#39;re much more willing to betray people you don&#39;t know than you will people you do know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d see you all in your were forms?&quot; Karen asked, her voice more curious than afraid or mistrusting.<br />
<br />
&quot;A night, yes,&quot; Daniel answered, &quot;for the most part, while we can change at any time... by law we can only change after sunset in public. Outside of that... you&#39;ll only be able to change during specific holidays and group functions... depending on which one of you decides to be the were and what were-beast you become.&quot;<br />
<br />
By now Francine returned to the dining room with a large platter of hamburgers that she placed in the center of the table. Peter coming behind her placed down ketchup and mustard next to platter of hamburgers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Peter,&quot; Francine spoke, &quot;Could you go get the American Cheese slices and the pickles?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure mom,&quot; Peter answered and headed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would you like to drink?&quot; Francine asked the Charlstons interrupting their conversation with Daniel.<br />
<br />
They all agreed water would be the best option. Francine promised to be back with their glasses quickly. As she left, Moe returned to topic of the conversation they had started with.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... we&#39;d really have to follow this law that one of us has to give up our humanity?&quot; Moe asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Daniel said slowly and with a sigh, &quot;and it&#39;s not like you&#39;ll be giving up that much. You&#39;ll be in control of yourself and there will be PLENTY of extra perks that you&#39;ll come to like. Trust me... Francine and I were in the same boat you&#39;re in when we came here... and now... neither of us would go back even if we could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What sort of perks are there?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It varies with each were-beast... but there are some that go for every were-beast species,&quot; Daniel explained calmly, &quot;which will include a much longer lifespan and greatly enhanced senses.&quot;<br />
<br />
He also wanted to mention the enhancement of secondary sexual characteristics, but given that a mob family was perusing Moe and his family to try and get Karen, he figured that telling them that becoming a were-beast would make them sexy wouldn&#39;t sell well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would I be able keep Marcus away from me?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
Daniel gave a different sigh and looked over to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;While as a were... you would be stronger than any normal human,&quot; Daniel said slowly, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t purely use being a were as a reason to pick a fight. Just because we&#39;re weres doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t follow the law. If they come here... while the town won&#39;t take kindly to mob bullying, it&#39;ll still be the police&#39;s job to apprehend him and his associates and make sure that the punishment is in accordance with the law. If you become a werewolf just to maul the Gambonis... YOU would face legal prosecution for any sort of attack... not to mention that if they survive the attack, THEY would become weres and that could make dealing with them worse. If they attack you, you would have the right to defend yourself, but don&#39;t become a were to go after them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen looked down for a moment, mostly as if she was in thought over something.<br />
<br />
&quot;And at the same time... were-beasts aren&#39;t invincible,&quot; Daniel added, &quot;there is the well known silver allergy as well as the vulnerability to fire... but if they can land a gunshot through the skull of one... that WOULD kill whoever they shoot, and that&#39;d even be with a lead bullet. And crushing and any trauma that could cause massive amounts of bleeding could also be potentially fatal. The biggest defense against the Gambonis is that they fail to find you. They may well find the town... as while it&#39;s not listed on many maps, any Google Earth search could probably find it in terms of the town&#39;s location... and if they do come around looking... we&#39;ll make sure that if all they do is ask questions, they won&#39;t get any answer worth keeping them around. They&#39;d leave and eventually their own mistakes and crimes will be proven and someone will arrest them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moe put a hand on his daughter&#39;s shoulder. While Nichole seemed completely unwilling to become a were, he was willing to do it to protect his daughter, and from what he heard she seemed interested in being their family&#39;s were to protect herself as well. And at the same time, Moe also knew that he was really running out of places where he could take his family to keep them safe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully you&#39;re right then, Dan,&quot; Moe said slowly.</p>
