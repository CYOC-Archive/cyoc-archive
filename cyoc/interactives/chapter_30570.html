<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Stephen, or Steve as he liked to be called, was the first to notice the change as he noticed his corpulence right away. Steve had always wanted to become a bearish type guy, but his overactive metabolism never allowed him to gain mass, in either muscle or fat. Sure, he was as muscular as he was going to get, having a swimmers build, but that was as big as he could ever attain. Now, for some reason the rules that his body had set in place by his DNA were non-existent or over-written some how. Steve could even feel his mass growing, his muscles becoming bulkier, but slightly... nothing extreme or over-the-top. Steve began to feel increasingly horny as well, wanting something at that moment, but he was afraid to even look in another direction than directly in front of him.</br><br>Hair grew slightly thicker on all three men's bodies, not to mention Jack's new five o' clock shadow on his once clean shaven face. The bodies of Jack and Guy began to strain against their clothes from the little bit of added muscle and fat. As the fluids stopped flowing out of the three, they felt their cocks harden and straining, almost to the point of exploding, but to their surprise their cocks grew. All three stared down in disbelief, not sure of what was going on, but not opposed to it either. Steve could not help but to look at the other men, somewhat out of a sexual hunger, but more so to see if what was happening to him was happening to them.</br>
<br>Steve took quick glances at each man to his right and left, hoping that neither of them caught what he had done. However, when he looked back in front of himself and was about to zip up and leave, he felt a meaty hand from his left grab a hold of his wrist and another meaty hand grab a hold of his shoulder. Steve looked up at the man on his left, smiling at Jack, who now sported a thick, one inch long dark brown beard. Jack smiled at him with a mischievous toothy grin, which if Steve didn't know better, he could swear his bicuspids were longer and shaper, like fangs.</br>
<br>"Oh ho... look what we got here Guy! I think we got ourselves a gay boy!"</br>
<br>"Yup... I think we do! Caught him lookin' at both our cocks like he wanted to suck on em'."</br>
<br>"Is that what you want to do boy? You wanna suck my meaty man cock... hmmm?"</br>
<br>Steve didn't know what to do, secretly he did want a taste, a rather long lasting taste, but at the same time he didn't want to be beaten for being gay.</br>
<br>"I... no, I am not... I don't want your cock... I'm not like that!"</br>
<br>Guy walked over to the door, locking it and the three in the room, not even noticing that his hands shifted into paws or his fingernails have turned into claws, short ones for now.</br>
<br>"Oh... but I think you are and do! My buddy Guy has already locked the door, so it's just the three of us. No one else is gonna walk in and see you suckin' my bear cock!"</br>
<br>Steve hesitated, seriously thinking over his situation, knowing that this guy was offering him what he has wanted for a while. The opportunity to have sex with a big cocked, beefy and hairy man. Hell... he didn't have just one, but two bear men. Not to mention he had himself to offer up, as he just reached their size and hairiness. Steve didn't know if he should just say anything or go down on the guy, but he licked his lips in sexual hunger and that was answer enough for Jack.</br>
<br>Jack nodded toward Guy, who was standing directly behind Steve, who was now facing Jack, and Guy grabbed Steve's shoulders to keep him in place, even though Steve really wasn't even considering leaving. Jack began taking off all of his clothing to get more comfortable, which he found was a bit difficult to do because of his unrealized growth. Slowly, with every inch of clothing removed from Jack's struggling body, revealed how much more Jack had turned into an ursine god! His pecs, biceps and triceps were voluptuous, appearing to be soft mountains of muscles. They were well rounded and huge, not tight and sinewy like body builders. Jack's stomach was packed with a small spare tire, but it was hard and well-carried, unlike the nasty hanging fat on some men. Jack's body hair looked like a cross between hair and short, dense fur. After Jack took off his boots, Steve noticed that his feet were now bear paws, with thick pads on the bottom and long, curled black claws where his nails used to be. Steve looked back up at Jack, somewhat staring at his huge cock. Jack now sported a ten inch long cock, that was six inches across. Jack's cock had a gigantic mushroom head, covered in precum that had been dripping down and pooling on the floor. Steve was hungry, but he didn't know if he could even fit that monster cock in his mouth. Steve looked up at Jack, noticing that he didn't look like Jack anymore. Jack's ears rounded out and moved on top of his head, while his face pushed out into that of a bear muzzle, complete with a wet, black and leathery nose, and a long, sharp fang filled maw.</br>
<br>A look of confusion came over Jack's face... unsure of why Steve was hesitating.</br>
<br>"Are you gonna suck my bear meat today cub... or are we gonna forget the whole thing?"</br>
<br><i>Cub... what did he mean cub?</i></br>
<br>"But... but you're a bear... a real bear man!"</br>
<br>"Yea... what of it? So are you and Guy!"</br>
<br>At that moment, Steve was stunned by his words. Steve looked at himself and saw that he too had meaty muscles, meaty bear paws with long, thick and curled claws. his feet were the same. Steve felt his face and ears, feeling that they too matched Jack's, bear part for bear part. Steve also noticed, in his somewhat absent mindedness of looking at Jack's cock, he had ripped through all of his clothes and they laid beneath him in a clump on the floor, completely shredded!</br>
<br>"Are you ok there cub? You look as though you haven't been a werebear your whole life."</br>
<br>Steve knew that just moments ago, he was human and never had been a werebear in his life. He never went through a change this drastic in his entire life.</br>
<br>"No... that is the thing... Moments ago, we were all human, not looking like this."</br>
<br>"Cub, I don't know what you are talking about, but anyway lets get back to you and my cock. Are you gonna suck it or not?"</br>
<br>Steve drew his attention back down to his cock, wanting it more than ever, especially now that he had a mouth to take it all in. Steve dropped to his knees, opening his mouth and slowly taking in his cock, inch by wonderful inch. Jack moaned a very bearish moan, feeling his cock slowly become engulfed by Steve's talented maw. A gush of pre flowed from the tip, splashing Steve's tongue as well as the back of his throat. Steve loved how it tasted, it was a bit salty and at the same time sweet like pure liquidized sugar.</br>
<br>Once Steve made it all the way down, he sucked hard while pulling almost all the way off, just as slowly teasing Jack's cock, while stopping at the very tip of Jack's mushroom head. Steve repeated the process just two more times and that was enough to get his rocks off. As Jack released his torrent of cum into Steve's hungry mouth, Steve felt a wash of cum spray all over his back as Guy must have been furiously jacking his cock, while watching the two go at it.</br>
<br>As soon as Steve pulled completely off, Jack shot one more spurt of cum onto Steve's muzzle. Steve lapped up the sweet juice from his maw, hungrily wanting more. Finally released of their build-up of seed, the three walk with arms wrapped around one another, unlocking the door and prepared to enter the rest of the world.</br>
<br>As they opened the door, the three looked at each other, smiling. When they pushed the swinging door open, they saw...</br></p>
