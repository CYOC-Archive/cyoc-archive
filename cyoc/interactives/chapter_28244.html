<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle was frozen. He didn't dare hang up. His friends were all eagerly waiting for whatever was about to happen. He shut his eye, preparing for the worst.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; said Jennifer, &quot; You're not alone. You wanted to make my humiliation public, did you? Thought  you and your friends might have a good laugh pulling me off my high horse or whatever. Fine. The gloves are coming off. You wanted some fun? Have some then. You will transform into a gay blue collar, whose  homosexuality is contagious.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You fuckin' bitch,what the hell is wrong with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You shouldn't have messed with me Kyle. Enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what blue collar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don't care. Let's just see what the curse does.&quot; Jennifer said, and slammed the phone down onto the receiver.<br />
<br />
Kyle slowly hung up the phone. He didn't feel any different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, come on, what did she say. Don't hold out on us, man&quot; Josh piped up. He was so turned on by this whole process. The power of it was just too much. The adrenaline was pumping through his veins. Hopefully Kyle would turn into something pretty; pretty and horny. He couldn't wait.<br />
<br />
Kyle didn't answer.He just slowly turned around, waiting. Suddenly he began tingle. He watched in growing horror as his reflection began to shift in the mirror. Suddenly his hairline began to recede, the sides rushing backwards to form a sharp widows peak. The hair itself shortened, shrinking into a buzzed stubble. The stubble began to stretch down until a five oclock Shadow covered his 15 year face. He reached u to touch it, it felt like sandpiper; his dick shot to attention, painfully tenting his jeans. It began to darken, his sandy blond hair turning a deep black. His face began to blur in the mirror, his bone structure was shifting. His face became sharper more clearly defined. He watched laughs lines appear at the corner of his eyes: he was getting older. He could feel it: 23,24,27, 29, stop.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he doubled over in pain. His body pulsed and throbbed. His arms and shoulders suddenly exploded, muscle rippling down them His chest expanded, popping the seams of his small polo with a ripping sound. He watched as his legs began to bulge within the now way too small jeans, and fought the pain to reach his belt, his package was bulging within the pant. The belt undone, he tore his jeans off the as quick as he could His underwear was in shreds, and his perfectly circumcised dick stood at attention, reaching up to his bely button.<br />
<br />
As quick as it had started, the pain was gone. Gasping for air he looked up into the mirror, ignoring the six gaping faces of the boys around him. But it wasn't over yet. He began to tingle all over, his chest in particular. He watching as a dark spot appeared in the reflection just above his collar. He gently touched it: it was hair a patch of long black hairs. Suddenly he watched as a dark fuzz sprouted and rushed up his body. His legs were covered in a thick coat, his crotch was a jungle. Through the tattered remains of the shirt he saw the dark fuzz spread upwards and outwards from his treasure trail to cover his six pack. He reached up and ran his hand through the thick chest hair, it felt so good.<br />
<br />
His shirt suddenly twitched. It seemed to gain of it's own. It faded to a deep grey and seemed to grow and change shape. It spread down his body, clinging to his limbs. When it finally stopped, kyle could see it was a one piece jump suit. It was unzipped to the waist but cinched there, and the top half hung down behind him. He reveled in the reflection, a muscular hairy torso, stubbled face, chiseled italian features: He was just so god damn hot. He turned himself one. His mind flooded with images: cars,tires, grease. His memory shifted. He could still remember who he was, but these newer memories seemed to sit on top them, they were just more important. He was a 29 year old mechanic, and he loved dick. There was nothing hotter than hot sweaty masculinity.  Suddenly a smell reached his nostrils He looked at the mirror: he could see grease and oil smeared in places across his chest, and he glistened with sweat: as if he had just come off the work floor. He hand reached toward his dick. <br />
<br />
Suddenly it spasmed. A throbbing jolt of pleasure. He looked down. Josh was on his knees at his feat. His hands had managed to undo the zipper, and he was know playing with Kyle's balls. He fondled and groped. Kyle's eyes rolled wildly. He could control himself. He saw the other guys, practically drooling, unable to turn away. Suddenly Josh couldn't control himself either, he took the throbbing dick into his mouth. Kyle came with explosive force, erupting into Josh. When it was done though, his dick was still hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll have to d better than that, kid.&quot; Kyle said with a rumbling basso. &quot;But you'll get better with practice&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, you're beautiful. How did this? Why do I-? Josh was so confused. He was straight. He like women. Nothing made him harder than a pair of breast straining against a too small bikini top. Yet hear he was, unable to keep himself off a sweaty, balding mechanic. His cock lurched as he ran his eyes over the muscle torso standing in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh. Josh...&quot; Kyle whispered, forcibly lifting the boys face to meet his gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Josh said, his mouth dry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare&quot;</p>
