<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat pondered upon what to do Dan now. He was in an egg and at her complete mercy. It was fun, but really extremely hard to decide what to transform him into next. Something humiliating for him, of course, but what? The possibilities were limitless. It would be hard to decide. He had made her childhood miserable but now, she was the one in charge. She would take her sweet revenge and it would be great. She could do literally anything to him, yet she had to settle on something appropriate. Something that reflected well what he had done to her. A poetic justice of sorts. He had mocked her, insulted her, hit her, accused her of things she had not done, broken her toys and cheated and lied through school and life while her parents and (female) teachers all fell for his acts and ate it all up eagerly. So now she&#39;d make him live to know a bit what someone he liked to torture, at home or at school, lived with someone like him around, and what it was like. So... Should she transform him into a girl? A nerdy kid? A little sister? A hot girl to be bothered by disgusting, stinky men and their unwanted advances? A mother in charge of brats? A boy who wasn&#39;t as good-looking as him? A nobody? And then she had a brilliant idea. She could do better than that and get revenge for all the toys of hers he&#39;d broken. She had read about a wizard who specialized in living toys in a book of magic. She would sent him Dan, alongside with a letter explaining things to him.<br />
<br />
Dan woke up slowly but when he did he was furious. He was still in that damn egg and he felt weird. Too hot and his insides felt very strange. He had to get out. And precisely, that egg was cracking, under his fists and the pressure of his arms and shoulders. It finally let him free and he was out into the light. It blinded him but as he looked about him he saw that he was in a very different environment that he normally knew. He had landed on a thick carpet and the room was decorated with past colors. There were books and all sorts of jars and trinkets on shelves. The room was lit up with warm lights as well. But the strangest thing was certainly the size of the room itself and its furniture. Everything was out of proportion! Made for giants! Yet as Dan started walking, he found his body felt strange still. He thus looked down and understood why it was the case. He was covered in fur! Pink fur! With a white belly. And his insides were just soft and without any bones or muscles whatsoever, as far as he could tell as he pressed upon his body. As he pressed upon it with hands that only had the vague shape of a thumb and whose rest were just fingers fused together. It was... It was a teddy bear paw! Dan tentatively felt around his face and could indeed feel a hard nose made of plastic, same with the eyes, and rounded soft ears. He was a chubby, fluffy, pink teddy bear! A living toy. He screamed in fright and shame. What had his bitchy sister done to him? The world was not gigantic, he was the one that had shrunk! But his screams attracted what he&#39;d consider anytime unwanted attention.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, my little princess?&quot; said a voice behind him.<br />
Dan turned around, startled. It was another plushie. Of a very large, very long caterpillar. It was smirking.<br />
&quot;Princess?...&quot; stammered Dan. &quot;No... You don&#39;t understand! I&#39;m a guy! A dude! I&#39;m human! I was bewitched and I woke up here! But I&#39;m not a pink teddy bear! I&#39;m not!&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re in the home of the Toy Wizard. The wizard who gives life to toys. He brought you in your egg a few hours ago.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, can he help me? Because I don&#39;t want to be a teddy bear!&quot;<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re a little princess teddy bear. That much is clear. So you should be the part.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?...&quot; said Dan, dumbfounded.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re such a cute little teddy bear. The cutest. A princess teddy bear,&quot; smiled the caterpillar. &quot;I don&#39;t see a human boy.&quot; <br />
He approached Dan and tickled him under the chin. Dan chortled in laughter. He was the first surprised. How come he was so ticklish? The caterpillar chuckled and then seized Dan, trapping him in his many arms, his back pressed against the soft chest of the large plushie.<br />
&quot;What... What are you doing?&quot; stammered Dan.<br />
&quot;Punishing you. Helping you adjust to your new life,&quot; smiled the caterpillar evilly. &quot;You broke your sister&#39;s toys when you were young. It made you laugh. Well, now, you&#39;re the sort of toy you loved to mock and destroy. A princess teddy bear. But the wizard won&#39;t be as cruel and stupid as you were. You&#39;ll just become a living toy like the rest of us sand learn to live like what you now are. A baby teddy bear. A very girly, silly and princess-y one. I&#39;ll pamper and molly-coddle you until you yield and accept this life. If not, the wizard will take charge. I&#39;ll be you carer, though. I love turning bullies into the sweetest, girliest and silliest living toys.&quot;<br />
He bent down and kissed Dan on the cheek. The former teen was appalled. No! Him, a baby? A girly baby? It couldn&#39;t be possible! And then the caterpillar proceeded to tickle him, playing his fingers upon his victim&#39;s doughy flesh and soft fur. Dan roared in laughter. Tortured! He was being tortured without an ounce of pain. He giggled uncontrollably and squirmed in helpless spasms. The caterpillar just uttered sweet nothings and nonsense into his ear, commenting on which part of Dan&#39;s body was the most ticklish and adding playful &#39;coochie coochie coos&#39;. He said to Dan he&#39;d tickle him into submission, that he&#39;d tickle him silly and that soon he&#39;d feel happy acting like the most innocent girly baby. That he already loved him very, very much and that he&#39;d make him the best teddy bear princess ever. His words had beneath them the joy of making Dan into a plaything and to break him utterly. The caterpillar said he&#39;d name him Giggles because Dan was not a girl&#39;s name and because he had never seen such a ticklish toy. He peppered Dan&#39;s tummy with kisses and let his fingers glide slowly upon the soles of Dan&#39;s feet. He poked and wriggled his fingers teasingly under his arms and on his sides. The caterpillar was having the time of his life. And by the time he relinquished his fun a bit, Dan, now Giggles, was a twitching, sobbing mess. The caterpillar was happy. This one would be fun to turn into an adorable baby and to tickle endlessly. He&#39;d smother that one&#39;s will with the sweetest pampering. He carried Giggles to an empty room that was already fitted with everything to make Giggles the perfect baby. He put a cloth diaper on Giggles, tickling him some more, slipping a pink pyjama on him and fitted a bib and frilly bonnet as a final touch. He pretended to give a battle to his newest baby and told him he&#39;s tickle her long and hard if she resisted. After she was done and burped, he patted her white tummy teasingly. Oh yes, Giggles would be an incredible source of relentless teasing. He then placed her in a toy cradle with a mobile, turning it on sand leaving Giggles there, promising him much fun time together with a kiss on her forehead.<br />
<br />
Giggles, formerly Dan, lost track of time as she got subjected to more and more humiliating pampering. If she resisted, the caterpillar tickled her for hours on end. She was mollycoddled to the extreme, the caterpillar praising her and never failing to use positive reinforcement. Giggles now lived in a sweet, babyish, princess-y world and he kept hearing he was a teddy bear prince, and the most adorable one too. She was forced to walk on all fours, wear exclusively pink, talk only in babble and coo and gurgle. Her days were spent in a playpen with blocks and other simple toys for infants. And as time passed, Giggles just felt this life becoming normal. To avoid more tickles, she was determined to not give the caterpillar a reason to indulge in his favourite means of torture, when he did not resort to poofy diapers, frilly bonnets or cutesy dresses. However, that meant obeying the caterpillar and acting as a baby without fail. And this constant living like a baby was getting disturbingly normal. Yet a small seed of rebellion, one that was still Dan, remained there. <br />
And one day, Giggles did try to escape, leaving the room on her tow legs. But she did not go far and she&#39;d spent too much time crawling on the ground. A bigger teddy bear caught her and gave her back to the caterpillar. Later, the wizard came and without a word, took a panicked and screaming Giggles in his arms and then on his lap. He took out a pendulum out of his pocket and made it sway in front of Giggle&#39;s eyes. She knew he was hypnotising her but she had no power to stop him. In fact, her willpower vanished. The man&#39;s voice was so soothing, so caring... Caressing, even... He said she was a teddy bear. And she was, yes, no doubt about it. And as a teddy bear baby, she had to act like one. Being pampered meant many, many carefree pleasures and fun, so why not accept it fully? Caterpillar was nice. Caterpillar did say sweet things. Caterpillar&#39;s teasing and tickling were fun! The peppering of kisses and the raspberries of Caterpillar resulted in Giggles gurgling and squirming in fun and joy. Yes , everything was perfect when you were a teddy bear baby. And Giggles was the cutest one ever, so it would be such a waste not to act like she was the most adorable ever. She was lucky to be so happy and live in a soft, sweet world where Caterpillar loved her very, very much. Giggles&#39;s eyelids drooped and she slept peacefully. The next morning, she was back to normal, happily cooing and gurgling and indulging in anything pink or girly. She loved being pampered and Caterpillar knew that even if Master had eventually resorted to his powerful hypnosis, most the work was his. Another bully turned into a delight for the very toys he had destroyed.</p>
