<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I will be using [_] to show thoughts and &quot;_&quot; to show speech from now on.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two began to get ready for their date. Ophelia, much to her disappointment, knew Heather was right about having a proper shower. While her saliva was not sticky and was very quick to dry or drip off, it left a smell. To Ophelia, she was apparently unable to dislike her own saliva&#39;s smell, but for Heather, who had mentally accepted Ophelia as her mate, felt the smell was too distracting. It was by no means a bad smell, in fact it was quite the opposite. It smelled too good. <br />
<br />
Additionally though, the smell made her horny. [Maybe the smell of one mate&#39;s saliva is a natural aphrodisiac to the other partner? And if so, does my saliva do the same to her?] Thought Heather. She hadn&#39;t been fully awake yet to hear Ophelia talking to herself, and wasn&#39;t able to read her mind. So she still didn&#39;t realize yet that,not only her saliva, but her body oder, her urine&#39;s smell, her cum, her body&#39;s taste even, her stinky sweat were all major turn ons for Ophelia. Basically if her body produced it, and while Ophelia was in heat, it was practically guarenteed to make her horny. <br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Ophelia was made to let Heather showed alone, and was forced out of the bathroom when Heather had threatened to withhold milking her for a full day. Somehow the thought had made her excited though, which she felt was concerning. [I&#39;m not turning masochistic, am I? The thought of being hurt still scares me, but whenever Heather makes the small threats, I get so god damn horny. I guess I just like it when Heather is completely in control? Yeah, that sounds most likely to be it. I would seriously hate it if she didn&#39;t milk me for a day afterall. Its just the thought of HER controlling when I get milked turns me on. And it isn&#39;t just getting milked either, but simply just letting her set the pace of our relationship, commanding me when and how to do random things, hell I think I would even love it if she started just fucking me out of the blue, without asking or letting me know before hand, just walking up and sticking her cock in me, or suddenly lifting me up and impaling me on her cock as we sit together. Even the thought of some day waking up with her already knotted deep inside of me is making me wet with anticipation.] Analysed Ophelia, while she sat, unconsciously crouching on all fours like a dog,  with her tail wagging back and forth, just outside the bathroom door. <br />
<br />
Only when she heard the shower turn on, did she finally noticed her posture. &quot;Hehe, looks like I really am becomming her beloved puppy!&quot; Ophelia laughed to herself, no longer holding any kind of opposition to the idea of being Heather&#39;s pet. It gave her an idea too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Beldazarr, I wish to make 4 more changes, do you mind?&quot; Ophelia whispered, hoping to not let Heather somehow hear her wishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly, as you still are my Mistress, Lady Ophelia&quot; greeted Beldazarr, and adding &quot;and a congratulations to you both from myself, on successfully achieving your first pregnancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Ophelia became emotionally overwhelmed. So much so that tears of joy began to roll down her face. She was pregnant. The realization of what that fully meant was suddenly hitting her mind all at once. She was carrying Heather&#39;s children. Her children. She was going to be a mother. She eould begin getting bigger, as the eggs grew in size. She would eventually have to lay them. She would then need to keep them warm, and once they hatched she would nurse their babies for a week. <br />
<br />
Now that she knew she was pregnant, she felt like she had to inform Heather immediately, even if she had to break down the bathroom door. In order to bust through the locked door, Ophelia had assumed a crouching position, preparing to launch herself. Right as she was about to leap, Beldazarr interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now hold on for a moment Mistress&quot; she doesn&#39;t need to know right this second to the point of breaking down the door. Just be a bit more patient. He had interacted with dragons before, and knew that having more patients was something the entire species as a whole was in dire need of. He had trued to stop her only because he knew she was only half dragon, and that Ophelia might be able to wait a bit before acting rashly. Luckily he was right.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, it&#39;s not like she is going anywhere. And she did tell me not to enter unless the building was on fire or something extremem like that. Guess I was just a bit too excited&quot; admitted Ophelia as she started rubbing her tummy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am glad that you can still be reasoned with. Now you mentioned you had a pair of wishes?&quot; Reminded Beldazarr.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I almost forgot about them. Ok, first can you make Heather able to orgasm without passing out? And secondly, I want to make my saliva produce a better, deeper, and healthier clean than any modern soap or shampoo could do. While also not smelling as strongly so that Heather wont feel the need to wipe if off before going into public.&quot; Wished Ophelia.<br />
<br />
She had felt a bit disappointed when Heather said she would be taking a &quot;proper shower&quot;. Ophelia had misunderstood her real reason though, since Heather had used an excuse of her saliva&#39;s scent being too strong. The real reason was that having Ophelia clean her entire body with just her tongue was actually the biggest and strongest of Heather&#39;s various fetishes. She was extremely turned on by tongues. Long tongue, using your tongue to do things like another arm, girls licking their own pussy/ass, people licking girl&#39;s pussy/ass, and this fetish had apparently included fully having her full body cleaned by her lovers tongue. <br />
<br />
She had only said she was taking a proper shower as an excuse. She really was just sitting on the edge of the tub, furiously masterbating to the memory of Ophelia&#39;s tongue bath. She had to get this out of her system before their date, or risk making a serious mess of herself when at dinner. She was fully anticipating getting turned on by Ophelia&#39;s eating if she used her tongue to eat or drink. And if she didn&#39;t handle this now, she was afraid she would not be able to control herself.<br />
<br />
However, because she was not under the water, she had heard Beldazarr&#39;s announcement, and she too had broken out in tears of joy, making her masterbating feel a bit awkward now. She was soon to be a mother, or maybe father now? She did have the cock in the relationship. So being called the father made sense. Even if she liked the title of mother a bit more, she knew Ophelia was already unquestionably the mother. It was then she noticed her boobs felt a bit odd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, now that Heather isn&#39;t going to faint anymore when we have sex, I want her also to be lactating. She originally was a girl, and I feel a bit guilty. Like that I kind of stole the role from her. So I want to share the experience with her a bit if I could. Plus if I lay more than 6 eggs, I won&#39;t have enough teats for all of my babies, so having an extra 2 more will be a big help.&quot; Requested Ophelia. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you may have misunderstood once again. You likely will have at most 4 eggs. It is extremely rare for dragons to lay more eggs than they personally can nurse. Not that it has never happened, but the likelyhood is so low of a chance that it is basically not worthy of being a concern.&quot; Explained Beldazarr.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see. Well still please do it, even if just to make me feel a bit better. But don&#39;t make her overproduce breastmilk like I do. And please make her back able to comfortably carry their weight.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And for your last wish Mistress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I knew how to properly be a girl. As in, knowing how to style my hair, hoe to make cute outfit combinations, how to walk in high heels, and such. But please dont change my mind and/or way of thinking too much. I really just want you to give me the knowledge of how to do them, and the muscles memmory to do them with, so that I will not be an embarrassment to Heather when out in public.&quot; Ophelia had been concerned with her lack if experience at being a women. But now she no longer had to worry about it as knowledge of applying make-up, walking in her custom high heels, info on the latest fashion, and more entered he mind. &quot;Thank you so much Beldazarr! And I mean for everything.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ophelia went over and gave Beldazarr a quick hug. Surprising Beldazarr for a moment until he remembered that she was part dragon. Normal humans were unable to touch him, and would pass right through his body. But she was no longer just a normal human. She then went to her room to get dressed, forgetting completely that Heather had asked for BOTH of them to take a proper shower. <br />
<br />
Heather on the other hand, had just finished her masterbation, still crying a bit. She knew what Ophelia wished for, feeling her freshly produced breastmilk sloshing around in her slightly larger boobs. Her nipples also had expanded to a similar size as Ophelia&#39;s, only an inch shorter. However, unlike Ophelia&#39;s, her teats were collapsible, or maybe telescopic was a better way to discribe them. She could extend them out or pull them into themselves at will. When fully collapsed, they were only slightly longer, and a bit fatter than how they use to be, but that was just from the extra skin used when they expanded out. <br />
<br />
Her back muscles musy have also been slightly strengthened. She had been generously endowed since she hit puberty, and with them, came a few years of chronic back and shoulder pain. However, she no longer felt any discomfort whatsoever. She knew her now milk filled tits were obviously heavier then they have ever been, but to her surprise, they actually felt lighter then ever.<br />
<br />
Heather quickly ran her hair under the water, before turning it off, eventhough she had never actually showered. Drying of slightly while wrapping herself up in a towel, she opened the door expecting to see a crouching Ophelia. But to her surprise, she was no longer there. Moving to the bedroom, she found her mate digging through her closet, being careful not to let the current state of the room ruin any of the clothing. Ophelia already had on a gorgeous black cocktail dress, with a fully exposed back and a very deep V in the front, showing off her 3 sets of cleavage entirely. No bras, could be seen anywhere noted Heather, wondering if Ophelia even had any (she would find out later that she didn&#39;t because they were impossibletl to fit around her wings comfortably). The only reason her dress was conforming to her shape was thanks to a thin strap which went around her upper torso, tucking under her H-cups, while wrapping just above where her wings met her shoulder blades. This band of fabric covered elastic was crucial to not letting her C-cups be fully exposed, and yet Heather found herself wanting to snip it off with a pair of scissors. <br />
<br />
While chuckling quietly to herself at her immaturity, she slowly made her way over to Ophelia, attempting to sneak up behind her distracted mate. &quot;I see you also decided not to shower in the end dear&quot; Ophelia suddenly announced, not even looking in her direction. &quot;I can still smell that you are covered in my saliva&#39;s scent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, you caught me. Guess there is no tricking that nose of yours anymore, huh&quot; Heather said as she dropped her towel, having dried off completely. She no longer felt embarrassed or self conscious about being naked in front of Ophelia.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; said Ophelia suddenly apologising. &quot;I made a change to your body without asking you. But I had a good reason to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sure you will make a great mother sweetie&quot; Heather said, as the both of them began getting teary eyed again. &quot;And I will be there right next to you the whole time too. And now I will be ready to lend you a spare teat when you need it&quot; she joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not mad? Even though I stole the role of Mother from you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My best friend willingly became my cute girlfriend, and is now pregnant with my children. And on top of that, is full intending to not only deliver, but hatch and even nurse the babies. How could I possibly be mad? You even made me able to help you nurse the babies. If I can get all of that for just the cost of the &#39;Mother&#39; title, I would take that trade 100% of the time, every time.&quot; Reassured Heather, pulling in Ophelia while letting her lay her head sideways ontop of her naked tits as she held her. <br />
<br />
This action however really hammeded in just how much Ophelia had shrunken in height. Before her change, the two of them had been roughly equal in height. Both were a few inches over 6 foot tall, with Heather actually being slightly shorter. Now though, and without counting her wings, which were truely massive things that brought her full height to almost 7 feet. Ophelia&#39;s human-ish body was now only 5&#39;-4&quot;, at best. And that&#39;s even with her now permanently raised heels. She was now a full head taller than Ophelia. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on now, lets finish getting ready. Our reservations are only set 2 hours from now. I still need to get dressed, and both of us still need to do our hair and makeup, well, maybe just me for makeup&quot; Heather said, wondering if makeup was even necessary for Ophelia.<br />
<br />
She was absolutely gorgeous. Her lips already had their natural coloration mimicking a perfect shade of lipstick. Her eyelashes were both long and full, lengthening slightly more the further away from her nose they got. Her eyebrows were neatly trimmed, being shapped into 2 beautifully thin lines. There was not a single flaw on her skin either. Not even a blackhead or mole, and certainly no wrinkles or discoloration anywhere. <br />
<br />
Her purple ears were still as elegantly smooth, being long and pointy, even with a slightly raised and pointing about 45° backwards, Heather still felt compelled to rub them inbetween her fingers. She noticed they also had numerous tiny holes which mirror eachother all along their length. Apparently Ophelia had an extensive collection of earrings, studs, and chains somewhere. Maybe even a long piece of material too to cover them with.<br />
<br />
Letting go of Ophelia, Heather began dressing herself with the clothes she had brought. However, she did notice when Ophelia took out a particularly sexy piece of jewelry, and attached it close to her bellybutton. Apparently, Ophelia had her navel pierced. The 2&quot; dangling accessory, adorned with deep red gemstones looked alluring and contrasted well against her black dress, nearly pure white hair, and dark purple scales. All Heather could do was stare at her stunningly beautiful mate, only slightly jealous of her natural beauty.</p>
