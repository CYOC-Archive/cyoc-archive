<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom decided to type &#39;Sheep&#39; into the field. He wanted his family to remain close, so he figured what&#39;s closer than a flock of sheep. <br />
<br />
Next an option appeared, along with the names of his family members. <br />
&#39;Please select a Role for each target&#39;<br />
<br />
Next to Samantha the default option was &#39;Mother&#39; he decided to let that be. And next to his adult kids, Henry and Susan, the default option was &#39;Offspring (Lamb)&#39;. He left that stay as default as well.<br />
<br />
Next to his own name however, he thought of an idea. He wanted to know what the program would do if instead of keeping the &#39;Father&#39; setting, he changed it to &#39;Offspring (Lamb)&#39; like his kids. Tom chuckled slightly to himself, as he figured this would cause an error in the game. But no such error occured. <br />
<br />
Next was an option that read &#39;Intelligence (1-Human, 10-Animal)&#39; For this option be typed in 4 and the screen showed &#39;Mostly Human, Some Instincts&#39;<br />
<br />
Finally there was one more option for duration. Tom typed in 1 week for this field. <br />
<br />
At the bottom of the screen there was a button that read &#39;Commit Changes to (4) Selected Targets?&#39; <br />
<br />
Tom clicked it without hesitation, sealing his and his family&#39;s fate for the next week. <br />
<br />
Almost instantly Tom felt a jolt through his body and he froze. He heard a short cry and the sound of something hitting the floor in the kitchen where his wife was located. <br />
<br />
Tom fell out of the computer chair he had been sitting in and instantly felt off. His muscles started to ache. He could feel his bone shifting and cracking. His fingers started to harden and turn black. He could feel his toes doing the same. Tom could see small patches of white fluffy fur started to grow down his reshaping arms, even as they started to grow shorter....much much shorter. He was shrinking. He could see his face start to push out into a small white muzzle. <br />
<br />
During this time he could hear moans and cries coming from the living room and kitchen. &quot;What....is happening?!&quot; Cried his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t.....baaaAAA!&#39; was all Tom could reply with as his vocal cords turned his human voice into the gentle baa of a lamb. He was being swallowed by his clothes at this point, his feet, well hooves, were pulled from his socks and shoes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Baaa baa&quot; was all Tom could hear coming from the living room, followed by a louder &quot;BAAAA&quot; coming from the kitchen. <br />
<br />
Tom felt his body stop twisting and aching as he slowly stopped shrinking. His world was dark, as he was now covered in the shirt he was wearing. <br />
<br />
Tom slowly tried standing, but found he could only stand on all fours and was stuck in his t shirt still. He struggled to break free but ended up getting more tangled in his clothes. His heart started to pound faster and faster. He was getting scared now. <br />
<br />
&quot;BaAAaa baaa!&quot; Tom cried out for help. He was trapped. He couldn&#39;t figured out what had happened to himself. <br />
<br />
Then he heard the sound of what seemed like clomping on the hard wood floor as something approached him. He felt someone tugging at the shirt he found himself trapped in. Soon there was light and he was able to winkle his little body free of his once too small of a shirt. <br />
<br />
Tom was free. The world looked sooo much bigger to him now. He quickly turned his head to look at himself. What he had feared was actually true...he now had the body of a lamb. A baby sheep. He had white fluffy fur, small legs and a tiny little tail. <br />
<br />
Tom then froze....if he had turned into a lamb then that means that his family..... He slowly turned around to look at his savior. Sure enough, standing behind him was a fully grown black furred female sheep. Who, but the look on her face, was NOT happy. Tom figured this to be his wife. His wife had been African American, so he figured that&#39;s why she had black fur as a sheep. <br />
<br />
&quot;BABA BaaaaAaA!&quot; The black sheep said, but in Tom&#39;s mind he could hear his wife&#39;s voice saying &#39;What happened to us?!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baaa baa baa&quot; Tom replied saying &#39;I though it was just a game on the computer, I didn&#39;t know this would...&#39; his soft little baa&#39;s were cut short by his wife <br />
<br />
&#39;YOU did this to us?!&#39; she replied angrily. &#39;You turned yourself into a freaking lamb? What is wrong with you?!&#39; <br />
<br />
Tom hung his head low &#39;Im sorry....&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You turned me into a fucking ewe! Jackass! Look what happened to my breasts!&#39; she turned her body so Tom could see the large black udder between her hind legs. &#39;This thing is super heavy and uncomfortable!&#39; Tom&#39;s eyes were transfixed on the udder now. He looked longingly at one of the swollen tears, milk slowing dripping from it. He had often sucked on his wife&#39;s black tits before, but had never longed for them this badly. <br />
<br />
&#39;Tom?....Tom! My eyes are up here!&#39; his wife demanded. Tom looked up at his wife. &#39;Youre a sicko. Are you attracted to my breast....well udders?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No....not at all actually. But I am really hungry....&#39; Tom said shyly <br />
<br />
&#39;Hungry?&#39; Samantha asked. &#39;You mean...you want to drink my milk? That&#39;s gross...&#39; she said, but at the same time she had a feeling, no, a need to feed her lamb, well husband. <br />
<br />
&#39;I think it&#39;d help us both out ...&#39; Tom said as he slowly approached his wife&#39;s rear. The smell of his wife had changed. Instead of a pleasant perfume smell, she was giving off a very animalistic odor, one that would have normally turned Tom away, but now he found oddly welcoming and calming. <br />
<br />
Samantha watched in silence as her husband walked to her udder. Her need to feed him was too great. <br />
<br />
Tom placed his small muzzle up to her teat, the smell of milk filling his nostrils. He paused &#39;Do you mind if I?...&#39; he asked sheepily<br />
<br />
&#39;Go for it hun...&#39; his wife replied.<br />
<br />
Tom wasted no time as he opened his mouth and placed the tip of her teat into his small mouth. He found he couldn&#39;t bring it completely into his small mouth, but was able to start sucking. <br />
<br />
Warm milk started to flow from his wife&#39;s udder into his waiting mouth. He eagerly suckled at her test, like the lamb he was. <br />
<br />
He continues to feed for minutes. Samantha standing there, a slight feeling of pride grows inside of her as she watches her husband feed. <br />
<br />
Tom felt slightly odd sucking on his wife&#39;s udder, that use to be her breasts, but was too hungry to care. <br />
<br />
That when they both heard....</p>
