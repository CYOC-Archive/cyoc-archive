<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The events of this story take 1 week later, Zack has regained control of his body and Sophie has returned to her life.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Zack, come here for a moment,&quot; Jeff&#39;s gruff voice called from the living room. Zack, who had just finished his morning swim routine and was toweling off in the hallway, paused and glanced at his father through the doorway. Jeff was sitting on the couch, his muscular frame dominating the space, his eyes fixed on Zack with an intensity that made him uneasy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Dad?&quot; Zack replied, stepping into the room and draping the towel around his neck. His lean, athletic body glistened with moisture from the pool, muscles rippling as he moved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit down,&quot; Jeff commanded, his tone leaving no room for argument. Zack complied, perching on the edge of the couch. He could feel his father&#39;s gaze roving over him, studying every inch of his physique. It was unsettling, especially given the family&#39;s peculiar dynamic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother mentioned something interesting this morning,&quot; Jeff began, his voice low and thoughtful. &quot;She said you&#39;ve been experimenting with... body swapping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack&#39;s heart skipped a beat. He hadn&#39;t intended to tell anyone about his newfound ability—not after years of feeling like the odd one out in a family where everyone else could possess others at will. His mother and sister had always taken advantage of their powers, using them to make his life both easier and more humiliating. But now, it seemed, his secret was out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess I can swap bodies with people,&quot; Zack admitted reluctantly, avoiding his father&#39;s piercing stare.<br />
<br />
Jeff leaned forward, his large hands resting on his knees. &quot;What exactly does that mean? Can you swap back? How long does it last?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know all the details yet,&quot; Zack muttered, feeling small under his father&#39;s scrutiny. &quot;I just figured out how to do it recently. It feels weird at first, but then you get used to it. And yeah, I can swap back whenever I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes narrowed thoughtfully. &quot;Interesting. Very interesting. You know, son, I&#39;ve always wondered what it would be like to experience someone else&#39;s body—not just to control it, but to actually BE them. To feel everything they feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack swallowed hard, sensing where this conversation was heading. &quot;You mean... you want to try swapping with me?&quot; The idea was both exhilarating and terrifying. He&#39;d never swapped with anyone outside of his own experimentation. What would it be like to be in his father&#39;s body? To feel those massive muscles, that commanding presence?<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded slowly, his expression serious. &quot;Yes, I do. I think it could be... enlightening. For both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack hesitated, his mind racing. Part of him wanted to say no, to reject the idea outright. But another part of him—a bolder, more curious part—was intrigued. What if he could finally understand what it was like to be his father? To have that kind of strength, that authority?<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Zack said quietly, his heart pounding in his chest. &quot;Let&#39;s do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s lips curled into a rare smile. &quot;Alright then. Let&#39;s give it a go.&quot; He stood up, towering over Zack, and extended a hand. Zack reached out and grasped it, feeling the rough texture of his father&#39;s skin against his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Close your eyes,&quot; Jeff instructed, his voice steady and calm. Zack did as he was told, focusing on the connection between their palms. He could feel the warmth of his father&#39;s hand, the coarse hairs brushing against his own skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, just relax and let it happen,&quot; Jeff continued. Zack took a deep breath, trying to empty his mind of any doubts or fears. He felt a strange sensation building between them, almost like a tingling electric current that started in his chest and spread outward.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the world flipped upside down. Zack&#39;s vision blurred, and for a split second, he felt like he was falling. Then, just as quickly, everything snapped back into focus. He blinked, disoriented, and looked around.<br />
<br />
He was still in the living room, but everything felt different. The walls seemed too close, the furniture too large. He looked down at his hands—no, not his hands. His father&#39;s hands. Massive, calloused, powerful.<br />
<br />
Zack tried to stand up, and the room swayed slightly as he rose to his full height. He stumbled a bit, unused to the weight and bulk of his father&#39;s body. He looked at his reflection in a nearby mirror and gasped. There stood Jeff, staring back at him with Zack&#39;s wide, startled eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; Jeff&#39;s voice asked from beside him. Zack turned, and there was his own body, standing next to him, looking completely at ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird,&quot; Zack admitted, flexing his new muscles experimentally. They responded with a fluidity and power that was intoxicating. &quot;But... amazing. These muscles are incredible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled, sounding eerily like Zack&#39;s own laugh. &quot;Isn&#39;t it? Feels good to be strong, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack nodded, marveling at the sensation. He felt invincible, like he could take on the world. But there was also a strange sense of vulnerability, knowing that he was wearing his father&#39;s body. It was both thrilling and disconcerting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you take a walk around the house?&quot; Jeff suggested, his voice tinged with amusement. &quot;Get used to the new you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack hesitated for a moment, then decided to follow his father&#39;s advice. He took a step, then another, getting a feel for the rhythm of his father&#39;s stride. As he walked, he couldn&#39;t help but notice the heavy swing of his father&#39;s large, dangling cock between his legs. It was surreal—like carrying a foreign object that didn&#39;t quite belong to him.<br />
<br />
He wandered into the kitchen, feeling the thick carpet beneath his feet, the cool air against his skin. He opened the fridge and stared blankly at its contents, momentarily forgetting which foods were his and which were his father&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoying yourself?&quot; Jeff&#39;s voice called from behind him. Zack turned to see his own body leaning casually against the doorframe, watching him with a mix of curiosity and amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s different,&quot; Zack replied honestly. &quot;In a good way, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, clearly pleased. &quot;Good. Now, why don&#39;t you try something else? Maybe explore a little more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack nodded, feeling a sense of excitement bubbling up inside him. He shut the fridge and moved to the living room, his father&#39;s body responding easily to his commands. He walked over to the mirror again and gazed at his reflection, trying to see himself through Jeff&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
He lifted a hand and ran it through his father&#39;s thick hair, feeling the coarse strands between his fingers. He traced a line down the side of his face, marveling at the roughness of the stubble that bristled against his touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to try... something else?&quot; Jeff&#39;s voice prompted softly. Zack turned to look at him, and suddenly, an idea struck him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t we... switch clothes?&quot; Zack suggested, a mischievous grin spreading across his father&#39;s face. &quot;Just to see how it feels.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
They moved to the bedroom, each taking a seat on the bed. Zack reached down and began unbuckling his father&#39;s belt, feeling the unfamiliar weight of the leather in his hands. He pulled it free and dropped it to the floor, then worked on the button and zipper of his father&#39;s jeans.<br />
<br />
As he slid the denim down, revealing his father&#39;s thick, veiny cock, Zack felt a flush of heat rise in his cheeks. It was strange—almost embarrassing—to be handling his father&#39;s genitals so intimately. But there was also a perverse thrill to it, knowing that he was in control of this massive, powerful body.<br />
<br />
He pushed the jeans down further, letting them fall to his ankles before kicking them aside. Next came the boxers, which clung tightly to his father&#39;s groin. Zack grabbed the waistband and tugged them down, exposing more of his father&#39;s manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel free to explore,&quot; Jeff&#39;s voice encouraged from the other side of the bed. Zack hesitated for a moment, then reached out and wrapped his fingers around the base of his father&#39;s cock. It pulsed slightly in his grip, warm and alive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Zack murmured, squeezing gently. &quot;This is... different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, it is,&quot; Jeff agreed, his voice laced with approval. &quot;Keep going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack obeyed, sliding his hand up and down the length of his father&#39;s shaft. The texture was rougher than he expected, the skin slightly bunched up as he moved his hand. He could feel the veins twitching under his touch, the smooth head slipping between his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like it?&quot; Jeff asked, his tone sly and teasing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Zack admitted, his voice shaky. &quot;It&#39;s... really something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled softly. &quot;Good. Now, how about we try something a bit more... adventurous?&quot;</p>
