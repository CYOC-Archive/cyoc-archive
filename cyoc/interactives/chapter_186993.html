<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, so so so, who wants to change next?&quot; Emily asked, hoping to assuage the throbbing she felt that was the hallmark of his new manhood.<br />
<br />
Just as the other three family members fell quiet and let his question hang in their air rather uncomfortably, Olivia mused and shook his head, stepping forward and with a heavy sigh, raised his broad hand up. <br />
<br />
“Eh, I’ll go.” He spoke, his baritone voice casually pushing aside the dire effects of the camera’s power almost comically.<br />
<br />
“But, mom, what if you turn into something else? I mean, you’re sort of the only… Adult? Here?” Emily prodded, confused by his father’s decision. Paul nodded, before stepping forward and trying to bring his case to the discussion.<br />
<br />
“Liv, let’s be reasonable here, I’m… Like this, Emily is a boy, and Rick is… Well, Rick isn’t what he’s supposed to be!” Rick voiced her offense with a sassy hand placed on her generous hips and a lilting “hey..!”<br />
<br />
Olivia smirked, his tired eyes casting an almost sensual gleam to them as he eyed Paul’s petite frame and stroked his lantern like jaw in thought.<br />
<br />
“I know, I know… But, let’s also be practical here, Paulie.” He began, noticing the flinch Paul had when he used her new nickname.<br />
<br />
“My wife is coming home, real piece of work, that one, and while she may be a helluva pain in my ass, I think even being someone else might be fun, though I will admit…” He paused, flexing a large bicep and unashamedly kissing it to the surprise of his family. “I may just miss these beauties…” He looked down and bounced his pecs and cupped them, unused to but quickly appreciating the massive form he exuded to his former husband now daughter. Emily faced Rick and Paul uneasily, before fiddling with the camera quickly.<br />
<br />
“Right… Well, here we go uh… Dad?” Olivia chuckled, posing with a boisterous flex as his body tensed up his photogenic physique and in an instant, the room filled with a bright light as the four was filled with a familiar vertigo.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Olivia grunted as she regained her bearings, though the flash was welcomed and the queasiness was beginning to fade, she couldn’t make heads or tails over what happened.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck, what just- Wait a minute, wait just a damn minute…” Olivia’s deep voiced greeted his ears as he slapped a meaty paw against his now broader chest, feeling the muscles jostle with strength as he realized the changes surrounding him. Emily gasped, the first to shake off the Camera’s dizziness only to see the towering man who was now gazing at his larger hands and bulky body. Paul balked at the figure, while Rick, who was the last of the four to become conscious once more stared, mouth agape.<br />
<br />
“Uh… Liv…?” Paul started, giving Olivia the once over as everyone quickly realized that once again the camera was being just as inconsistent as it was chaotic.<br />
<br />
“I barely… Changed.” Olivia continued for her, noticing the tight tank top that strained to contain his chest, his bulging biceps tensed as he flexed in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“I uh, wouldn’t say all that,” Emily murmured, Olivia glanced, tiredly.<br />
<br />
“Do I even ask?” Olivia rolled his eyes and stepped away from the family, instead turning to face a large decorative mirror and gasped.<br />
<br />
“I’m young in the face?!” Olivia barked, voice rumbling despite the thick fingers that were touching his chiseled and honed cheeks.<br />
<br />
“Korean, apparently, I didn’t even think men could be like that…!” Rick touched her chin in thought, as Olivia brushed his dark hair and noted the smaller nose and youthful looks that graced them.<br />
<br />
“Where’s… Where’s my wallet?” Olivia asked, not even noticing the other occupants as he patted his tiny short shorts and felt a bulge in the pants. <br />
<br />
“Wow, indecent much, dear?” Paul uncomfortably laughed, noting the sizable lump that laid between her previously normal wife’s generous legs. <br />
<br />
Olivia flared his nostrils and his pecs jostled obscenely as he fiddled with the leather. Emily and Rick peered forward, as Oliver growled, snarling his teeth in disdain.<br />
<br />
“Well, there you have it!” Olivia bellowed, as the three were taken aback.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean, Mister…” Rick began, unable to resist giggling. <br />
<br />
“What? What happened, Mom?” Emily said, setting the camera aside the mirror on the table it had sat above.<br />
<br />
Olivia sighed, placing the leather item into the young man’s hands and went back to nitpicking at the mirror image.<br />
<br />
Emily brought the brown purse and huddled with Rick and Paul. Within the contents of the wallet had Olivia’s license changed, the smiling face of a woman had been replaced with a hulking Korean man who’s simplistic black hair and lantern jaw highlighted the thick neck and chest his head had rested upon. <br />
<br />
“Hwang Oh Seong, &quot;Oliver&quot;, age 37 years, weight: 255 pounds.”<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t <I>sound</I> right, but it FEELS right.” Olivia rubbed a thumb against his chin, wondering how he had changed. “Maybe I could grow a beard…”<br />
<br />
“Uh, honey?” Paul held her arms and sighed. “What do you remember?”<br />
<br />
Olivia shrugged, winking into the mirror. “The same old, grew up in the states, parents were Korean, loved to work out.” He paused, growling as he leaned forward and made a most muscular pose. He slammed a fist into his chest and roared. <br />
<br />
“Won the IFBB, insta went off, adopted a beautiful daughter and a son. Bought a nice house… Widowed, I think? Nice maid. Can bench more than anyone else in this state I bet.” <br />
<br />
Emily’s eyebrows rose, his jaw nearly dropping to the floor. <br />
<br />
“And uh, what do you remember before?”<br />
<br />
Olivia looked at him in the mirror as if he had asked the color of the sky. “Emile, you found this vintage camera from god knows where for a present to me, and ol’ Rochelle had to pretend she didn’t know you bought that thing with your allowance… Wait,” Olivia looked up, before the realization hit him. <br />
<br />
“…And got my princess involved so I wouldn’t know! You know you can’t hide anything from Dad.” He said confidently, brushing his shortened hair to a side, feasting on the view in front of him.<br />
<br />
Emily nodded, to the horror of the other two individuals next to him. “Right, right, just gimme a minute, Dad, we uh, feel so bad you found out about the gift…”<br />
<br />
Olivia waved a heavy hand and tugged on the tank top to see the deep cut cleavage that was laid into him. <br />
<br />
“All good, son, all good.” He smirked in the mirror and pulled out a phone from his pocket, taking a well calculated picture of himself.<br />
<br />
Paul clawed at Emily’s blazer and pulled him towards a bewildered Rick. “Emily, we need to fix this, my wife is <I>not</I> some,” Paul paused, looking at her newly minted father flexing his bicep for a hungry audience online.<br />
“Musclehead selling himself to a bunch of freaks on the ‘net.”<br />
<br />
Emily nodded. “Yeah, I hear you, but not only did she change, but she’s barely remembering who she was before.” Rubbing his forehead.<br />
<br />
Rick piped up, touching Emily’s arm. “So you’re saying we might not remember who we are either?!” Her voice cracked as she clutched the young boy’s arm. <br />
<br />
Emily waved off Rick’s grasp and huddled with the two. “I don’t know, I don’t think I pressed any thing different, it could be an effect of the camera, it could be because there was too many changes, I just, I just would need time figuring this out.”<br />
<br />
“Time’s something we <I>don’t</I> have time for, Emily!” Paul hissed, before nudging her head to implicate the previous result.<br />
<br />
“I’m not saying we keep experimenting on ourselves, maybe we just, take pictures of other people, work out the way the thing works…” Emily continued, whispering hoarsely.<br />
<br />
“You mean changing other people? What if we ruin their lives! What if they end up like us?!” Rick pointed out, voice bordering on a yell.<br />
<br />
Emily angrily shushed Rick, looking up to see if her new father had noticed them speaking, but, to her confusion, Olivia had disappeared from his perch. Shaking his head, he bent back down to address his compatriots.<br />
<br />
“Look, I get it, but do we even have a choice? It’s be changed and lord knows what happens to us, or, we change someone or something else and hopefully work this out. You wanna end up thinking you’re a teen daughter to your wife or our maid?” She beckoned the two respond. Neither did and instead either looked away or scoffed.<br />
<br />
“Then it’s settled, we get the camera away from her, we find something or someone to change, figure out how to fix the dang thing, and from there we all go the hell back to normal. Capiche?”<br />
<br />
Heavy steps echoed as Olivia came into view with the camera clutched in his grasp. While his tank top had become practically held at capacity, Oh-Seong relented that this was the perfect tank top to capture his elite photographs for his instagram and fitness career. A few before and after photos of his training partners and clients, and the rest would be history.<br />
<br />
Garnering new confidence, Paul looked up and nodded.<br />
<br />
“Rick?” Emily regarded the worn out maid. She paused, sighing. “I don’t like this…”<br />
<br />
“I know, but it’s what we have to do.” Emily concluded.<br />
<br />
“Alright family, say, “Before!” Olivia spoke, easily catching the three off guard.<br />
<br />
“Wait, Olivia-“<br />
“No, mom!”<br />
<br />
None of them could anticipate the man catching their visages, and, to the camera’s own twisted changes. A familiar light filled the room as the three along with reality pulsed and transformed. But who would they become and what changes would be made? And would they even remember the conversation before?</p>
