<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the sun slowly began to rise and herald a new day in Moon Lake...<br />
Ben Twist slept soundly within his own bed. A few stray thoughts of Sarah the were-tigress crossed his mind, but then again, being your average teenager and a werewolf as well, interesting thoughts concerning a lot of were-females crossed his mind during the night as well.<br />
<br />
His parents, Samantha and Frances Twist, slept soundly too. The married lesbians were cuddled within each others&#39; furry werecat arms.<br />
Samantha dreamed only of their happy family and the occasional dalliance they shared with their friend, neighbor, and recently created werecat Martha Anderson.<br />
But not all of the Town Chancellor&#39;s dreams were sexual in nature. Thoughts of more peaceful moments: like dinner with or without Ben present, the quiet walks around the neighborhood she would take with Frances, or even just curling up on the couch with her wife and sharing a good book or something on TV with each other.<br />
She relished those tranquil moments of marriage and family life, and being long lived weres, looked forward to many more decades of them to come.<br />
<br />
Frances had similar thoughts and dreams, but there was also something else nagging at the back of her mind.<br />
Within a few years, Ben would be finishing college after high school graduation. How would she and Samantha respond to being &quot;empty nesters&quot;?<br />
While both women only looked to be in their mid-20s, both were actually much older because of their dual nature.<br />
They had talked about starting a family in the past, before Ben&#39;s natural parents died in a car crash and they adopted the toddler. Although he would forever have a place within their hearts and home, perhaps in a few years it might be time to reopen the original discussions of having a child of their own.<br />
Sure they would need a sperm donor, and Martha had (seriously?) suggested the Twists getting together for a quartet with her husband William, a recently created werefox.<br />
Frances could and would continue to ignore the nosy inquiries from her parents about when they might ever have the company of grand children, but wouldn&#39;t it be nice to hear the pitter patter of little feet around the house, regardless of who the donor might be and what kind of were the child would grow up to be?<br />
<br />
Nearby, their friends and neighbors the Andersons slept soundly in their own beds.<br />
William and Martha had spent a wild and exciting night intimately exploring each other&#39;s furry bodies until exhaustion claimed the couple.<br />
The fact that he was now a werefox and she a werecat not only made sex more exciting than ever before, but had helped their troubled marriage as well, for the fox side of her husband formally bonded with his mate. William swore that he would no longer cheat on Martha, although having since acknowledged and embraced her bi nature, thanks in part to becoming a werecat, Martha now had the pleasures of an open marriage too. She thoroughly enjoyed her initiation and wild night of passionate lesbian sex with the Twists, and even had another rendezvous scheduled for later that Monday evening.<br />
Yet occasionally, thoughts of having sex with others outside her immediate circle of friends entered her mind as well.<br />
She awoke about three that morning with a very wet vagina, after cumming in her sleep dreaming about hot sex with either Martin and/or Melissa Stovall, the were-mers a few blocks over. Martha&#39;s rational mind knew that she would never do anything to jeopardize the budding romance between her son Eric and their daughter Julie, but if the Stovalls were ever willing...<br />
Thoughts of what might be made her start sucking her husband&#39;s werefox penis on its way back to full hardness before she mounted him again.<br />
<br />
William awoke from pleasant thoughts of having a marathon sex session with Martha to discover another one in progress.<br />
Without even asking, William smiled at his wife before rolling them over as one, then taking Martha from behind while she was on all fours as he drove his top knot well into her pleasurable depths. He reached out to caress her breasts and rub her clit with his paws.<br />
Soon the couple experienced a series of rapid multiple orgasms together.<br />
With him still buried deep within her, Martha managed to turn around until they could start kissing again.<br />
Sleep came as the Andersons laid cuddled in each others arms once more.<br />
<br />
Their oldest son Nate had similar dreams of his boyfriend Alex.<br />
It wasn&#39;t until the move to Moon Lake that not only could Nate fully embrace his life style preference, but also his dreams since childhood of becoming a werewolf.<br />
Alex had not only initiated him into werewolf society, but was also his first gay lover as well. Nate willingly gave him his virginity and the two had been happy together since.<br />
Granted, their relationship had only been in existence less than two days at the moment. Nate honestly didn&#39;t know if Alex would wind up being &quot;the one&quot; that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, or even how to break the news to his parents that he was gay to begin with.<br />
Yet Nate knew there was no denying that he was finally happy and fully enjoying both who and what he was.<br />
Besides, having an actual date after school with Alex didn&#39;t hurt either.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Are you <i>absolutely</i> sure about this?&quot; Julie asked Eric, as they stood on the shores of the water that gave the town its name.<br />
&quot;If I wasn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t have married you,&quot; replied Eric, as he kissed his new bride. &quot;We&#39;ve been together for all of high school, college, and now we&#39;re about to spend the rest of our adult lives together. This is our honeymoon. You&#39;re my wife. I&#39;m your husband. You&#39;re my beautiful mermaid, and soon I will be your handsome merman,&quot; he said, opening the robe Julie had on to reveal her nude body underneath.<br />
&quot;I love you Eric Anderson,&quot; said Julie, as she opened his robe to reveal her new husband&#39;s naked body.<br />
&quot;I love you too Julie Anderson,&quot; said Eric, as they embraced and laid together on the ground, arm in arm.<br />
&quot;I just can&#39;t wait any more,&quot; she cried, while caressing his penis. &quot;Please, take me now. I give you my love, my virginity, and the ultimate gift of what will be our new lives together,&quot; said Julie, while moving him closer to the moist slit between her still human legs.<br />
&quot;I freely accept everything you have to offer, and give you my life, love, heart, and soul in return,&quot; replied Eric, as he felt the head of his cock slide into her wet folds.<br />
His penis only penetrated the first couple of inches, before it encountered Julie&#39;s hymen. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; he asked, staring deep into those beautiful blue eyes of hers.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she cried, as a slight tear began to run down her cheek. &quot;Take me. Let us be one now and forever!&quot;<br />
A quick, but gentle, shove and the deed was done.<br />
Eric laid on top of Julie as the newlyweds wrapped their arms around each other. The hard nipples of her bountiful bosom pressed against his chest as Eric answered the driving need to go deeper into her depths.<br />
He leaned forward and began to kiss her, his hands lovingly running through her long blonde hair even as Julie locked her legs around him to drive Eric even deeper into her.<br />
Soon the moment came as mutual bliss embraced the lovers. Each screamed out their pleasure and love for their mate as the joys of sexual ecstasy overtook them.<br />
They laid there on the shore in each other arms, gently caressing and kissing each other, until Eric started to shiver and moan.<br />
&quot;The moment is upon you,&quot; realized Julie, as she untangled herself from him and stood up. &quot;Come my love, and embrace both me and our future.&quot;<br />
Eric accepted her hand as Julie helped him up. Side by side, arm in arm, they walked together into Moon Lake until the water was up to their chins.<br />
Then Julie turned and held Eric in her arms as she said &quot;Soon&quot;, before gently kissing him again.<br />
<br />
Eric felt like his whole body was on fire, even as his hands and feet began to tingle. Julie grasped his hands in hers and raised them above the water line to see webbing had formed between the fingers.<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; was all Julie said, as she pulled Eric under the water with her.<br />
Eric blinked, as the initial surprise of now being able to see, hear, and breathe underwater washed over him.<br />
Then he looked at his new wife, who was simply smiling at her husband, while slowly transforming into her mermaid form to keep pace with his changes.<br />
As the webbing formed between his toes, his feet grew slightly larger as blue-green scales started to form and rise up his legs.<br />
He shuddered in pure pleasure at his first transformation, as his scaly legs began to merge into one large fish tail, even as he watched Julie&#39;s do the same.<br />
Then Eric Anderson embraced Julie Anderson, even as his new merman tail wrapped itself around his mermaid.<br />
The lovers kissed and caressed each other some more.<br />
Soon things began to grow more amorous as he lowered his head to suckle at her bosom.<br />
But when Eric wanted things to progress further, something wasn&#39;t quite right.<br />
&quot;Silly. I told you they would be within our protective sheaths,&quot; Julie said with a smile. She reached down with one hand to open the hidden folds that exposed her mermaid vagina, even as she reached out to Eric and opened the folds within his tail to reveal his new merman&#39;s penis.<br />
Soon the newlyweds continued their honeymoon beneath the shores of Moon Lake...<br />
<br />
As the alarm clock rang in Eric&#39;s bedroom, loudly announcing it was time to get up and get ready for a new day.<br />
As Eric rose, he couldn&#39;t help noticing the image in his bedroom mirror. There was a big smile on his face as he stared at himself, which made his happiness grow even more. The realization that there was another mess of the sticky white stuff in his pajama bottoms only added to his elation and warm feelings of Julie Stovall.<br />
<br />
CONCURRENTLY...<br />
The object of his affection was attempting to get out of bed for the new school day herself. Julie wanted nothing more than to stay under the covers and have more pleasurable thoughts about Eric, especially if she could pick up where the dream left off.<br />
But the sticky white mess inside her nightgown said it was best to go to the private bath within her bedroom and clean up.<br />
<i>Besides, not only will I see Eric later at school, but we have a date after last class today!</i> Julie thought happily to herself as she got up.<br />
<br />
Yet the one thing neither child realized was that each had the exact same dream about themselves!</p>
