<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After successfully leaving the party without being pulled aside, I got into my car and headed home.<br />
<br />
<b>Later that night</b><br />
<br />
I was in my room, thinking of what to do tomorrow when I got notification on my phone. I unlock my phone and saw that I had a text from an unknown number, but then my new memory set in and I realize this was Monique’s number. Out of curiosity, decide to reply.<br />
<br />
M: <b>Joey did you see what happen?</b><br />
<b>No, I went home soon after I altered reality. What happened?</b> :J<br />
M: <b>It was odd one of the party goers left in a fit of tears. It was only a minute or two afterwards we found out that it was Brad’s girlfriend. How did that happen? I thought you made Jessica into a maid?</b><br />
<b>Yeah apparently Jessica wasn’t the only one that was competing to be Brad‘s girlfriend. By making Jessica a maid, it caused the second runner up to become his girlfriend. This one is a bit worse but hey, what can you do?</b> :J<br />
M: <b>Oh, that would explain Mrs. Brockman’s reaction. She was angry about the girl at first, but then was concerned that the fact that this one left in a hurry.</b><br />
<b>WaM; Amber left in tears. Do you know what happened?</b> :J<br />
M: <b>Sadly, I don’t know. What I do know is that afterwards, Mrs. Brockman and interrogated Brad. Whatever he told her it must’ve been bad .</b><br />
<b>How bad?</b> :J<br />
M: <b>Bad enough that she cancel the party, kick everyone out, and confined Brad to his room. He is literally grounded and under house arrest. Beyond that I don’t know. I only heard bits and pieces of the argument. She warn him that if one more thing pops up, he is going to be in massive trouble.</b><br />
<b>Given what we know about Jessica I’m guessing he’s going to be disowned in a few days a week at most. But we don’t know what he did to warrant this. I’ll try to figure out on my end.</b> :J<br />
<br />
A second later I received a thumbs up emoji from her followed by a heart emoji. I then begin to think on how to approach this. Odds are Mrs. Brockman at confiscated Brad‘s phone so I can’t ask him directly. As I went over in my head on, who would possibly know Amber the most I immediately thought about Sasha. Maybe I can figure out what went wrong and also make plans for her birthday party. I took out the card and dialed the number. It rang a few times before someone picked up.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Hello?’</i>Came Sasha’s voice on the other end.<br />
<br />
“Hey Sasha, it’s Joey.” I answered.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Hey Joey. Ready to plan out your act for the party?’</i> Sasha asked.<br />
<br />
“A bit later; listen I left shortly after talking to you.  I just now got a text from Monique saying that something happened. From what I understand; Amber left the party in a fit of tears. Shortly later, Mrs. Brockman ended the party and kicked everyone out. Do you know what happened?” I asked.<br />
<br />
<i>‘At first I didn’t know what happened, but I managed to contact Amber later and what I learn was horrible.’</i> Sasha answered.<br />
<br />
“How so?” I asked.<br />
<br />
<i>‘So get this she was hoping to give the birthday boy a really good time. However, when she reached his bedroom, she is shocked to discover that he is having sex with another woman and that woman is Ashley. As in flesh and blood; Ashley.’</i> Sasha first explain. It’s odd that Amber would leave out her encounter with me.<br />
<br />
“So Brad managed to trigger that condition. Basically after being used as a sex doll once; she would turn back to flesh and blood.” I explained.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Then how come during their entire argument she slowly turned back into a sex doll?’</i> Ask Sasha.<br />
<br />
“Also another condition. Once she gets turned back into flesh and blood, she will have to have to be creampied in her vagina every hour or else she turns back into a sex doll. She’ll stay that way until another guy uses it and I know how Brad doesn’t share or until the next day when she turns back to normal permanently. So something happened after she turned back into a sex doll?” I explained and asked.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Apparently Brad was so upset of being cock block like that; he overpowered and pinned Amber to the wall. He ripped off her thong and proceeded to penetrate her.’</i> Sasha said.<br />
<br />
‘Oh boy.’ I muttered before Sasha continued.<br />
<br />
<i>‘I can’t believe it; Amber made a bit trouble, but she was now Brad’s girlfriend. This is how he repays her by raping her and using her as a cum dumpster? She ran out the house so fast afterwards, and it only took me a little while later to contact her to figure out what happened. What’s worse because of the nondisclosure agreement we all sign before the party, we can’t call the police. I so want to do something and punish him somehow.’</i> Sasha commented.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it by the sounds of it Mrs. Brockman is so upset that she’s literally have Brad under house arrest. I’m guessing what he did to Amber was strike two.” I said.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Strike two?’</i> Asked Sasha.<br />
<br />
“From my understanding; besides that incident with Amber, Brad broke one of the golden rules of the Brockman’s today. He violated the; ‘Look, Don’t touch’ rule by having sex with their maid Jessica. Originally his target was Monique, but since that age swap as we will call it spared her from that. From what I heard from Monique, if one more thing popped up, Brad will be disowned.” I answered.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Serves him right.’</i> Sasha commented. Satisfied by what I just learned. I decide to switch subjects.<br />
<br />
“Anyways wanted to discuss my price for performing at your party?” I asked changing the subject.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Sure.’</i> Replied Sasha.<br />
<br />
“Before we can discuss price. I think it’s better if we just set it as a budget. After all that gives us time to plan how many people are going to be transformed in my act. However, there is one thing that I am uncomfortable with.” I began.<br />
<br />
<i>‘What’s that?’</i> Sasha asked<br />
<br />
“Transforming myself.” I answered.<br />
<br />
<i>‘What?’</i> Asked a confused Sasha.<br />
<br />
“Mostly because I like the way I am and having to change myself, I do not like that. That doesn’t mean I’m not unable to do it. It’s just it’s gonna cost extra. So if you want me to transform myself, it’ll be $1 million.” I answered.<br />
<br />
<i>‘No way. I am not handing over 1 million just to see one guy transform.’</i> Sasha said.<br />
<br />
“I figured as much so just focus on the cheaper prices. So for transformations that will be not permanent a.k.a. the person will revert back to normal within 24 hours or when I say so; I’ll be $50 unless a special circumstances happens then it’s a 50% discount.” I explained.<br />
<br />
<i>‘How come?’</i> Sasha asked.<br />
<br />
“If they don’t follow my instructions properly, and as a result, their transformations are permanent or curse.” I answered.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Okay that explain’s it. A good way to arrange some happy accidents for cheap.’</i> Sasha answered and I smile little bit.<br />
<br />
“Okay now let’s talk permanent transformations, the cost of doing those types of transformations will be $100.” I continued.<br />
<br />
<i>‘So I want my little brother to be a little sister; I’ll have to cough up $100?’</i> Asked Sasha.<br />
<br />
“$200 actually but I’ll elaborate on that further. So those are the prices now we just need to work out the budget. To help with that, let’s talk about the transformations I’m willing to perform.” I answered.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Oh, that’s curious.’</i> Sasha replied<br />
<br />
“First, the transgender tricks, it’s when I flip the subjects/volunteers gender. Those transformations I tend to let those be permanent. And when I was picking my volunteers for Brad‘s party to do the trick on, I am in a pick one that want a change that is permanent but ones that are gay, but couldn’t get a date even if their life depended on it.” I explained.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Like my little brother, he confined in me that he is gay, but he doesn’t exactly look like my dad who was a Casanova in his younger years. He is mostly takes after my mom in the looks department though being honest those looks only works if you are a girl.’</i> Sasha exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“See that’s how we’ll make that trick work. However, I need to perform two of these transgender tricks. One on a male one on a female. It’s a bit of a balancing thing as I feel like the universal will punish me if I just change one person without changing a person into the opposite.” I explained.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Ohhhhh I just have the girl in mind. This is going to be awesome. I feel like we’re playing Cupid.’</i> Uncharacteristically squealed Sasha. Not really sure what she had in mind but if she thinks she has a perfect person for her brother or this other girl (soon to be boy) then more to power.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you understand so next type of trick. Age changing; is when I make my subject/volunteer older or younger. Now this is also a bit of a balancing act where I change two people in opposite directions because I feel like the universe will punish me, but I can easily ignore it.” I continued.<br />
<br />
<i>‘How far can take those people, age wise?’</i> Asked Sasha. That was a good question.<br />
<br />
“Not really sure but it would be interesting to find out. OK next trick I can do is inanimate, it’s when I can take the person and turn them into an inanimate object, say like a ball or in Ashley‘s case a sex doll.” <br />
<br />
<i>‘Okay out of curiosity, edible or non-edible?’</i><br />
<br />
“I would like avoid making people edible, nothing against it. It’s just it would be considered killing them.”<br />
<br />
<i>‘Understandable. We don’t want to kill them.’</i><br />
<br />
“Glad you understand. Now next is petrification it is when I turn a person into a statue.” <br />
<br />
<i>‘Isn’t that the same as inanimate?’</i><br />
<br />
“Except I mostly focused on statues in this trick plus they can be accidentally permanent transformations thus the discount I mentioned earlier.”<br />
<br />
<i>‘Again perfect to arrange happy accidents.</i><br />
<br />
“I like the way you think. Now the next one is kind of odd because it involves size changing. I’ll makes it different from age change is that the subject still remains the same age but they become bigger or smaller.”<br />
<br />
<i>‘I bet those can lead to interesting naughty things.</i><br />
<br />
“Oh I bet. Finally the last trick type I can do is animal. It’s when I turn a person into an animal. A classic trick I didn’t performed is turning a volunteer into a tiger.”<br />
<br />
<i>‘What about a human with animal characteristics?’</i><br />
<br />
“That would be considered anthro and those types of tricks are not permanent because it could technically lead to creation of a new species.”<br />
<br />
<i>‘These are interesting tricks and prices. It’s gonna be tricky to convince my mom the hand over a million dollars for your act.’</i> Sasha said in disappointment.<br />
<br />
“Is there something about your mom that we can take advantage of that my tricks can provide?” I asked.<br />
<br />
<i>‘What do you mean?’</i>Sasha asked in response.<br />
<br />
“Now this is something personal about the Brockman family, and frankly Brad feels greatly offended by this, but his mom enjoys raising girls. It’s why Brad as well Brad, his mom didn’t discipline him much and tried to lead the discipline up to the father who is always busy. Has she not enjoyed the party so far and if she has been more pissed at me, I would use the volunteers in the audience to regress them to little girls or baby girls, and give them to Mrs. Brockman.” I answered.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Really?’</i> Sasha asked<br />
<br />
“Yeah I’ve been to this house many times to know how much she dots on her daughters Becky and Betty. Plus Brad told me that his mom has condition and they’ve figured it out right after her second daughter was born. Mostly some women takes a week or two to recover giving birth, Mrs. Brockman is literally bedridden for a month or two. She always wants a big family, but after giving birth to Betty, they decided play it safe and had her tubes tied.” I answered.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Interesting. It gives me ideas but it doesn’t mean that I have any sympathy for the guy but still interesting.’</i> Sasha responded.<br />
<br />
“Please don’t share this with others but other than that that’s the type of tricks I can do and my prices. So we need to work out a budget so we can plan what transformations I’m going to do next time at your party.” I said.<br />
<br />
<i>‘Okay give me some time to think and I’ll call when and I have a budget figured out and then we could plan for the tricks.’</i> Sasha responded. After that, we set our pleasantries and hang up. The rest of the night was pretty much uneventful.</p>
