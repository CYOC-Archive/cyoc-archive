<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You continue looking around the store, seeing all kinds of costumes, ranging from cops, firemen, jocks, to construction workers and porn star suits. While most of them were intriguing and seemed to be a fun idea to wear, none of them really spoke out to you. For some reason you were hoping there would be a realistic animal suit or two. As you continue through the store, you notice a sign hanging above a doorway you hadn't noticed when you first got there. You look back toward the male attendant, giving him a look of curiosity, with him only returning a shrug to state he had no idea there was anything different about the store. You shrug it off, not really thinking of it as weird either, just that you didn't see it earlier.<br />
<br />
You continue walking into the doorway, noticing that it was a small room with hundreds of animal costumes hanging up. You notice that all of them were for men, as they all had sheathes and when you looked through one, it was empty. You only figure that it was something to house your own cock so you could go to the bathroom when you needed. You also notice that the costumes must have been for well built men as the chests showed well developed pecs, while the bear costume had a developed chest and a bear belly. As you look at the bear costume, you feel drawn to it as if you were meant to wear it. You back away, feeling it would be weird to wear the costume of a bear, especially because you were a man. You think in your head that you had always wanted to be a bear. The thought of masculinity and raw power seemed to be erotic, intriguing you, making you want to wear it even more. You try to pull away, but the costume seemed to have other ideas for you. You walk toward it, as if in a trance of some sort, pulling it off the rack. You inspect it, feeling the inside and realizing it was like a real bear hide. Wondering what kind of creature this even came from, you walk out to the store attendant to ask some questions. As you walk up to the man at the desk, he smiles at you and has a look of questioning what you wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me sir... erhm John, that is your name isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that is what my name tag says. What can I do for you sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I would like to know where your store had picked these costumes up. This feels like a real bear hide, BEAR SKIN!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... that is exactly what it is made of. The owner of this store loves to hunt wild animals for both food and sport. He then takes the hides, alters them to fit his body and then puts them in this store for animal lovers to play the part of their favorite animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean he actually cleans them out and wears them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that is exactly what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I guess thats kind of cool but kind of weird too. No matter... the real question I came to ask you was how do you put this on? I mean there are no zippers to put it on and then get it off and another thing. What exactly is this hole here for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sure you can guess what it's for, can't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course I can, I just didn't think I would need to get naked to wear one, that's all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, I can understand that... really I can, but the creator intended for it to be as real as possible. If you like I could show you how to put it on.&quot;<br />
<br />
You become a bit leery, thinking about another man getting undressed, getting completely naked and then putting on another type of attire. He senses your hesitation, then just decides to do it anyway, but walks over to the front door and locks it so that no one would be able to walk in without him knowing it. You stand there watching him walk toward the animal section, hesitating even more, not sure if you should even follow him. John motions for him to follow him and you do, being more curious about the suit than anything. As you walk into the room, you notice a second bear suit hanging in the same spot as the one that you hold in your hand. Baffled as how the new suit got there, especially since it seemed John was the only one in the store working that day. As you look at the costume as John pulled it off the hanger, you notice it looked exactly the same as the one you had in your hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did that get there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I suppose I forgot to mention one small detail. The owner of the store, as well as all of the costumes is a wizard. He has placed an enchantment on the store as well as all of the costumes. The enchantment acts as a ward to keep all of those who are not supposed to find the store away, it's like they don't even see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So wait... you are telling me that I am meant to see this store, I am supposed to even wear this costume?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be correct and the owner even told me that I would meet someone who would need help with a costume and I am the one to put on the same one and show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
John started shedding his clothes, just like a second skin and in mere moments, he was standing there naked before you. You notice his body was covered in scars from various surgeries. He was of an average build, nothing special and he was naturally smooth. Even his cock was completely normal, while being nothing to be proud about either. John stretched out the mouth of the bear and stepped into the costume. Pulling one foot into the leg and paw of the bearsuit, then he did the same with his other leg. As he pulled it up, he adjusted his cock and pulled it through the sheathe hole and it began to plump up, thickening to match the width of the sheathe. Your eyes open wide, amazed at what you were seeing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, you know this feels better than you can even imagine. It is like the parts of the suit I am wearing is a part of my body.&quot;<br />
<br />
John then continues, putting his arms into the sleeves, pushing his hands and arms all the way into the suit, finishing by placing his fingers into the paw fingers. John moves his fingers a bit to show the range of control that he still had and also to show that he still had the full use of his human hand along with the defining human element, the opposable thumb. Once he felt comfortable with his display, he placed the bear head over his like a hood of a hooded sweatshirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, all done! Pretty cool don't you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel attracted to this new form, wondering what it must really feel like. John could sense your resumed hesitation and just nodded with his head to go ahead and put it on. You look him up and down, getting a feel for how you would look, but you can't help staring at his hardened cock. It was strange how when he put on the costume he grew a bit, just to fit the costume's size.<br />
<br />
Slowly, your hesitations fade and you begin to disrobe, getting completely naked, and trying not to get embarrassed about being that way with another man. Your body was much like his, normal and completely unimpressive. The only thing different was the fact you had a normal amount of body hair in all the normal places. Slowly you climb into the suit, following the same steps John made, ensuring he put the costume on properly and fully. AS your body slides through the hide, you notice that skin quickly warmed up to your body temperature. The inside even felt a bit slimy, but you figure that was normal as it was skin from an animal. AS you slide your toes into the slots for the bear's toes, you feel the control that John had mentioned. You do the same thing with the other leg, pulling it up all the way to his cock. You put your cock into the sheathe and pull it through. Suddenly you feel blood rush into your cock and it begins to expand, filling the size of the suit, matching John's cock. Then you finish quickly, pulling everything into place and then pulled the bear's head over yours. You look yourself over, getting used to the look and especially the feel of the suit.<br />
<br />
Your eyes quickly dart over to John, looking him up and down, admiring the way he looked. You were shocked by your new found feelings, knowing that you weren't gay... well at least until you put the suit on. John noticed you checking him out and he grabbed his crotch seductively and wantonly. For some reason, that turned you on even further, making you want him in a lustful way. Before the both of you even realize it, the skin of the suit started to shrink and constrict against your skin. In a frenzy, you try to pull it off, but realize by pinching the suit's skin, you just pinched yourself. Your mind begins freaking out, knowing that this couldn't be real, that the bear's skin couldn't have become your own. You quickly realize that your sense of reality has quickly changed. Suddenly, the fur retracted into the suit. As you both looked at yourselves, you look like you were before, normal. You were disappointed that nothing seemed to happen. The only thing that was different about you right now was the fact that you were a bit more toned than you ever were.<br />
<br />
As you examine yourself, throughly disappointed at what happened, you stare at yourself as things started to happen. Your fingers ... they were looking ... different. Broader. Softer. Blinking, you look down at yourself as a strange tingle seemed to focus on your chest and body. With eyes wide, you look as your slim, toned chest began to grow bigger muscles ... but your belly began getting fatter! <br />
<br />
You gasp as you feel pounds slide onto you, your body began developing huge layers of muscle and fat. What the hell was happening?!! It looked almost as if two things were happening at once ... you were getting more muscular and more ... chubby! <br />
<br />
You noticed something else, the hair on your body was growing back out from whence it retracted, growing more dense than what was first on the suit. It was as if your body hair and the suit's hair combined to be something a bit different. Your arms, as they grew bigger and more muscular also became covered in hair. You continue to watch as your chest expanded to a fine barreled shape, you noticed that thick hair began re-growing on your chest too. You look down and just below that, your expanding belly grew to a nice round beer gut, also covered in hair. You were growing taller, reaching a height that seemed to be possible, well for normal people. The backs of your hands were hairy, everything was hairy! You felt the cheeks you shaved clean this morning and wasn't surprised to find a thick full beard had grown in the few minutes you'd been preoccupied with your body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Awes...&quot;, you started to say a few words but the deep baritone voice that had begun to speak startled you into silence. <br />
<br />
You found that the suit wasn't finished with you yet. You continued to put on muscle, though the fat seemed to have stopped growing on you. Finally the change seemed to stop. You surveyed your body. You guessed that you were about six foot five or so and you were almost completely covered in hair in some areas. Your beard was a normal length and was groomed neatly, the immediate image of Bo Dixon, from Colt Studios came to mind. You now have become a &quot;Bear&quot;. <br />
<br />
No sooner than that thought came to mind, you felt a jolt, like an electrical shock. You began to change again. Thick golden brown fur began to grow all over your body, you watch as claws grow from your fingers and felt a muzzle push out from your face. You grow even larger and even more muscular and more fat grew around your belly. Your underwear finally gave up and tore completely in two with your added girth. You looked at your huge paws, paws that retained the thumb of your human form but were as clawed and furry as any grizzly bear's. You felt your broad barreled chest covered in thick golden brown fur with your huge paw/hands. You looked at your pawed feet that had returned to what they looked like when you first put on the suit. You waited for a moment and sighed. The change stopped.<br />
<br />
Both of you were happy with what happened, it felt so awesome and so invigorating, but both of you were ready for something more, something different.</p>
