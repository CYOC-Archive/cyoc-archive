<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I slowed down a bit, letting Ethan get ahead of me. He looked over his shoulder and bared his teeth in my direction. I showed him my notebook, and he just rolled his eyes. He knew well enough that when I had an idea, I wanted to write it down. Nearly nothing would stand in my way. That was only technically true in this case. I was thinking more about how much I could change without people noticing. It seemed as though no one would notice unless otherwise stated. If I could literally make a thing of fiction reality, and even the subject didn&#39;t notice, then what else could I do. <br />
<br />
The thought came to me pretty instantly when I saw Corey and Josh together. I&#39;d been thinking about it a bit earlier when I turned him into more of a stereotypical Texan. But this time I really felt like I had a chance. &#39;Josh Stanlin, Corey Johnson and Ethan Montgomery all have a gene that allows them to turn into anthropomorphic creatures. Josh&#39;s gene reflects that of a horse. Corey&#39;s gene reflect that of a fox. Ethan&#39;s reflects that of a wolf. Ethan isn&#39;t actually a werewolf, rather everyone who has the gene is forced to turn into their anthropomorphic creature during a full moon, but Ethan never knew anyone else who did. He was afraid of it, only making it grow more uncontrollable. However, everyone who has it is able to control it, change at will and sometimes when they aren&#39;t thinking about it or get too excited; the person who has the gene turns into their anthropomorphic creature. In their excitement of training Ethan, Josh and Corey will accidently change into their anthropomorphic animal. Less than 1% of the population has it and no one cares about it at all.&#39;<br />
<br />
I reread it a few times to make sure that it sounded right. I wasn&#39;t 100% sure how good of an idea it was and wondered if it was possible for it to backfire. Though, everything about it seemed to work. At least on the initial setup. Any unintended consequences should be able to be fixed later. I finally lifted my pencil, satisfied with the result. The ink glowed, then dried. My heart skipped a beat as I wondered if I had the anthrogene. It was a 1 in a 100 shot, unlikely but possible. I tried thinking about it. Lion? No. Tiger? No. Rabbit? No... Each animal I tried, I focused on my ears turning to theirs. I wanted to see my ears turn into points and then migrate to the top of my head. No such luck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might need to change that later,&quot; I grumbled to myself. &quot;Made it too unlikely...&quot; I shook my head. 1% was still pretty likely and probably should have had massive changes to the world. But it would take a bit before really seeing them in full action. For right now, it was just Corey, Josh and Ethan. The jocks had already gotten Ethan over to the free weights and showing him how to basic bicep curls. They made sure that he was using the correct sized weight. They just kept scooting further and further down, after just one or two reps because it wasn&#39;t heavy enough. Their eyes growing larger and larger as he easily lifted 60 pounds. Then 65. Then 70. <br />
<br />
&quot;THAT&#39;S AMAZING!&quot; Corey shouted. He was practically jumping up and down. Red had started to color his brown hair. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you can lift this much!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan looked away. &quot;It is getting kind of heavy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Course it is bro!&quot; Josh gave him a hearty slap to the back. &quot;You&#39;ve already done like 15 reps. I guess I should have put more stock inta yer size.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ethan was clearly trying to temper his excitement, but with the two jocks celebrating with him, it was near impossible to at least crack a smile as they cheered him on. He almost didn&#39;t even notice as his tail swooped out from behind him and gave one wag. He was quick to pull it back in, accidently forcing a frown as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up bro?&quot; Corey asked. His hair was distinctively more red now with a bit of white closer to his ears. Ethan gave him a skeptical look. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh...&quot; Ethan clearly didn&#39;t know what to say, but it was obvious that Corey&#39;s hair had turned from his usual brown to a vibrant red. &quot;Were you always a red head?&quot;<br />
<br />
Corey looked shocked, then turned to the mirror and laughed. &quot;Whoops. Sorry bro. Got too excited,&quot; he smiled. The red gone again.<br />
<br />
Ethan stared now, mouth agape. &quot;How&#39;d--How&#39;d you do that?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That?&quot; Corey pointed to his hair and it turned red again. Then started to spike up, growing thicker and thicker into a more fur like coating.  It spread down to his ears, which were currently growing into points. They pointed outward then moved upwards onto the top of his skull. &quot;This?&quot; he pointed again. An even broader smile on his face as Ethan had the dumbest look on his face. All Ethan could do is nod. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the anthrogene bro,&quot; Josh was quick add. His own ears had turned into that of a horse&#39;s and his crewcut hair had grown out into a mullet running down the back of his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anthrogene?&quot; Ethan said stupidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man!&quot; Corey smile only broadened. &quot;Didn&#39;t you take biology? Like 1% of the human population has it. Like I can turn into a fox and Josh can turn into a horse. Really it can be any animal you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a wolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely!&quot; Corey said. He was already allowing his muzzle to push out of his face. His nose had turned pitch black and growing outward. White fur covered his face as it shifted. Bones cracked slightly as they changed. The fur continued down his neck and shoulders. Each place the fur touched, seemed to add a bit more lean muscle to his body. The average jock grew more and more into something a bit bigger. His shoulders pushed a little bit wider from his sides. Biceps grew a bit larger. But his waist stayed perfectly trim.<br />
<br />
His sleeveless shirt rose up a bit showing off his Adonis belt and belly button. Bright red fur covered his back while soft white fur covered his belly. His nails grew sharp claws and he made sure to kick off his shoes before the changes got down to his feet. It almost felt natural as he&#39;d clearly done it hundreds of times before and didn&#39;t want to get yelled at for having to buy new shoes. Again. His weight shifted to the front of his feet as the balls of his feet grew further back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tadah!&quot; Corey did a bit of a jig, spinning around and letting his fluffy red tail with a white tip trail behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Re-really..!?&quot; Ethan still stared dumbstruck. &quot;You&#39;re part fox?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh. All part cute,&quot; Corey smiled. <br />
<br />
Ethan watched as Corery&#39;s mouth moved perfectly with the words coming out of it. This wasn&#39;t a magic trick. <br />
<br />
&quot;How don&#39;t you know about this?&quot; Josh asked. &quot;It&#39;s taught in school...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Must have missed that day...&quot; Ethan muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Strange. When you turn 18 that&#39;s when your animal comes out. It usually likes to play but can be satisfied with just working out,&quot; Josh explained. <br />
<br />
Ethan felt a weird pit in his stomach. &quot;Okay...&quot; he stared more intently at Josh&#39;s ears, touching them and feeling that they were warm. &quot;And you&#39;re a horse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell to the yeah!&quot; That&#39;s when Josh started stripping down to nothing. His dick flopped about as he removed his jock strap. &quot;Don&#39;t let Rebecca see me. But if Corey gets to let loose, I should too.&quot; As soon as his shoes were kicked off, Josh started growing. Every part of his started growing outward and upward. He was already fairly tall, but he quickly passed Ethan&#39;s height and just kept growing. His thick muscles only seemed to grow even more as his body shifted. Even as he passed 7 feet in height, he maintained what looked more like a bodybuilder build than his more normal athletic one. <br />
<br />
His shoulders looked like massive cannonballs. Unbelievably large biceps covered with bulging veins covered the front of his arms, while perfectly sculpted horseshoe shaped triceps covered the back. The veins ran down in a perfect lattice along his massive forearms to his hands. His fingers had merged together into two finger and a thumb. Two heavy pecs bulged out of his chest and a cobblestone of abs laid directly below them.<br />
<br />
What was really impressive was the thick perfectly sculpted ass. Two globes sat on his rear that Corey gave a firm slap. &quot;Show off,&quot; he pouted. &quot;How&#39;s he supposed to hide you when you&#39;re the size of a fucking barn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be jealous,&quot; Josh bragged, flexing his massive muscles. He went in for a double bicep pose. His voice had dropped at least an octave as his neck over doubled in size. Thick traps filled in from his necks to his shoulders. But just like the fox, each word effortlessly left the horse&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
Ethan stood dumbstruck at the absolute size of the horseman in front of him. Then his eyes lowered to see the absolute size of the man&#39;s dick. Fully erect, running down one of his massive legs. &quot;JOSH!&quot; a female voice from across the gym called his name. &quot;YOU&#39;D BEST BE CHANGING BACK!&quot; Josh&#39;s confidence quickly faulted. Didn&#39;t matter he was a whole 2 feet taller than the next person to him, he seemed to shrink down next to nothing. &quot;NOW!&quot; the woman screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be back later,&quot; Josh smiled. He ran over to the woman, picked up with ease and jogged out of the building. <br />
<br />
Corey rolled his eyes. &quot;Him and Rebecca...&quot; he muttered. &quot;But why are you so intte--&quot; Corey stopped himself as he saw Ethan&#39;s ears on top of his head shaped into perfect triangles. Gray fur covering them completely and started to coat his hair. And a tail wagged happily behind Ethan.</p>
