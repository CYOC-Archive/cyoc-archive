<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Candy leans against the bathroom door frame, smiling, &quot;It&#39;s a bit more complicated than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your head turns to the door, gazing at the naked otter. You blurt out, &quot;No. You can&#39;t be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy laughs, &quot;You just emptied your ass full of Muffin&#39;s seed she pumped into your ass earlier. You didn&#39;t doubt reality then, when it felt good. The facts do not favor your current version of events. Muffin likes your willingness to be her butt slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head in defeat, &quot;I am losing an argument with myself.&quot; You wipe, flush, and clean your hands before exiting the bathroom naked, walking past Candy and sitting on your bed next to Muffin.<br />
<br />
Muffin pats your thigh, then pulls her hand into your flacid groin. &quot;Your not happy to see us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frustrated, you say, &quot;Ok. Obviously this is weird and I don&#39;t know how I can feel you, see you, but your not real. Can one of you explain what is going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy pouts, &quot;Awww, your mad and confused. We are the living embodiment of your two figurines over there. We are real, just as Muffin there patted your leg and reached for a rather disappointing cock between your legs.&quot; Muffin smiled and lifted your hand and placed it on her rather large, and engorged otter cock and knot. Candy continued, &quot;You feel that, because it&#39;s real. It was real when I took your cock into my pussy earlier. You are a kindred otter spirit, as only a kindred would have picked us out from all of the others in that store. There are rules for us, just as there are rules for you. No, we don&#39;t know all the rules, and yes, we can both read your mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
In silence, you just think a single word over and over, &quot;Crap...crap....crap...&quot;<br />
<br />
Muffin reaches behind you and strokes your shoulders, &quot;You own us. As a result, we three will have fun together.&quot;<br />
<br />
In your mind you think you don&#39;t own anyone, especially a sentient being.<br />
<br />
Candy interrupts your thoughts about morality and ownership, &quot;Don&#39;t worry...we are not slaves. You own two figurines, and we are bound to them. Your not committing some great atrocity by having purchased us. You, my friend, have the opportunity to be one of us for as long as your life exists. You can choose, as I did, to stay with us permanently as a trio and become a third figurine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Muffin smiles, &quot;Yep, Candy here was a rather prudish and bitter man who lost his family and never forgave himself. Then I came along, and now Candy is my best friend, fuck mate, and partner in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as you are about to ask if you could have kids with Candy, she laughs and nods, &quot;Yes, but not in the way your thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Muffin gives you a sideways hug, &quot;So you&#39;ll keep us? We can scratch that futa itch you were thinking about earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to hide your own thought,  you ask, &quot;So....you remember all that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy giggles, &quot;Yea silly. Your a kinky son of a bitch. I never doubted  you&#39;d keep us after Muffin knotted your ass and gave you one hell of a prostate orgasm. Oh...too bad you passed out from that. Muffin here knows all the right moves.&quot;<br />
<br />
As if to deny reality one more time, &quot;And you are both real. Your both here with me now. And this is how you want it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Muffin puts a finger to your lips, &quot;Shhh, if you tire of us or wish to get rid of us, just sell the figurines to someone else, and we will be out of your life.&quot;<br />
<br />
You reach over to Muffin&#39;s rather thick, broodmother thigh, and work your fingers into her fur, &quot;Let&#39;s see how this works, for a little while, is that alright? You already have me wanting that knot in my ass again. I never knew butt stuff felt so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy laughed, &quot;Stick with us kid, you won&#39;t be disappointed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Muffin pulled her hand from between your legs smiling, &quot;Since you asked about kids, you have the means to have them now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy worked to stifle her excitement, &quot;Too soon Muffin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down between your legs, and reaching between them, you verify your cock and balls are gone and replaced with a smooth, hairless vagina. &quot;I didn&#39;t feel you do anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
Muffin gives you another sideways hug, and starts to rub your back. You look up at her and soon feel weight on your chest,  then look down and see you now have two large tits, with rather think and erect, slightly throbbing nipples.<br />
<br />
You feel much less comfortable now....having lost your cock and balls, and now sporting porn star titties. You stand and walk over to the bathroom doorway to see your reflection in the mirror. &quot;I....I.....can&#39;t go to work like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy comes up behind you and palms one of your butt cheeks. You watch as the slit between your legs closes and a small finger grows along with some wrinkly skin until it&#39;s 12 inches long and holding two large and heavy testicles. &quot;You can go to work however you like, looking however you like, feeling however you like.&quot; You watch as your new large cock then slowly reduces until it is no more, and the smooth, hairless pussy reforms. The rest of your body alters to the female image you were thinking of, the woman who rides her bike to work with you a few blocks over. Candy whispers, &quot;Shall you try this for a while, it pleases you.&quot; You can&#39;t fight the truth, as your arousal has caused your pussy to lubricate itself.<br />
<br />
&quot;For tonight,&quot; you say, your voice just a whisper, but clearly feminine. Your lost in thought, as you watched your body change and transform in front of your eyes, and only when you felt arousal did you sense the slickness from your pussy. You ponder the rules.<br />
<br />
Muffin joins you and Candy in the doorway and smiles, whispering, &quot;We have time to learn the rules. They limit imagination and the fun. Let&#39;s stick to the fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have a moment of clarity, and turn to look at the otter&#39;s behind you, but they are gone. Your standing in your bathroom doorway, looking at a body that is not your own. &quot;Why do they do that?&quot; you think to yourself. You walk over to your dresser, and get a large t-shirt. You smile as you walk out toward the pool, putting on just a large shirt that hides nothing since your chest pushes out so far. Stepping into the water, you realize if this is a dream....you don&#39;t want to wake up. After a few minutes of swimming, you toss the t-shirt onto a deck chair and swim naked in the dark for quite a long time. You know you have work in the morning, and if this isn&#39;t a dream, you need to keep your job. You dry off with a deck towel as you walk back to your bedroom. You collapse on the bed, wrapped in the towel, satisfied this was a great dream.<br />
<br />
The alarm went off at 7am. You reach out still half asleep to turn it off, and sit up. That&#39;s when you realize your still sleeping on the towel, and your body is still very much female and well endowed, and you smile. Nodding to yourself you call out, &quot;Muffin, Candy....where are you?&quot;</p>
