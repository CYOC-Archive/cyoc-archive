<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Happy, but spent for the moment, Eric Anderson laid on top of Spencer Lawson, their furry bodies pressed against each other as they continued kissing and licking each other&#39;s muzzles.<br />
&quot;I never knew...&quot; began Eric, stopping to stare deeply into Spencer&#39;s eyes. &quot;I mean, I knew the basics of what I was missing out on,&quot; he said, sticking out his arm to look at what he could see of his new fursona as a recently created werepanther. As he flexed his paw and watched the talons of his claws move, he added, &quot;This may sound corny, but I always wanted to wait until I found that special someone.&quot; Then he looked back down at Spencer and said, &quot;Now that I have, and we&#39;re together at last, I&#39;m glad I did wait, despite that stupid Julie&#39;s wishes otherwise.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh Eric,&quot; replied Spencer, not bothering to hide the fact that his statement brought a tear to her eyes. &quot;I loved our time together when you were just a normal. It gave us a chance to get to know each other better and truly fall in love, instead of just giving in to a hyper-active were&#39;s libido. But now that you are a member of the furry set,&quot; she said with a smile, reaching up with her paws to start playing with his ears.<br />
Eric&#39;s new tail suddenly started thumping as Spencer felt his panther rod begin to expand once more within her hybrid vagina.<br />
&quot;So... your ears are just as sensitive as mine turned out to be in were form,&quot; realized Spencer, as the smile on his girlfriend&#39;s muzzle grew broader.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate to interrupt you two love birds, but Eric and I still need to fuck to make sure his transformation is complete body and soul,&quot; Frieda Knight reminded them. The new lovers turned to see the werepanthress sitting on the carpeted floor of the upstairs day room within the Knight family mansion. While he was new to were society, both Eric and Spencer could smell that Frieda had brought herself to a self induced orgasm while Eric gave Spencer his virginity while experiencing his very first transformation.<br />
Eric looked at Spencer, and she simply nodded in agreement while she continued to smile at him.<br />
Her boyfriend reluctantly pulled out of her, and both girls couldn&#39;t help staring at his new werepanther penis. It was sticking out of its sheath a good 8 inches while at &quot;rest&quot;, but quickly expanded to almost a full foot as Eric couldn&#39;t help getting a hard on from staring at the furry females.<br />
&quot;Before we continue, there&#39;s something Spencer and I would like to talk to you about,&quot; began Eric, as they both sat on the floor across from Frieda and held paws.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; wondered the werepanthress, while arching an eyebrow in surprise.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Spencer. &quot;We&#39;ve had a couple of long discussions about this since you first offered to induct Eric into were society. We want you as our friend and, considering we have the suspicion you were hoping for this to begin with, we&#39;d like you to be more than that with us if you want to.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Frieda in surprise, as she thought her heart skipped a beat.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; confirmed Eric, moving a bit closer to Frieda. &quot;Spencer&#39;s parents and mine are all swingers. In fact, they&#39;ve even had sex with each other several times since they first met.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; was all Frieda could say as Spencer continued the conversation.<br />
&quot;And being part werecat on my mother&#39;s side, I have no problem with tasting honey from time to time either,&quot; added the hybrid were, scooting a little closer to the werepanthress herself.<br />
&quot;So as long as you&#39;re cool with the fact that my heart belongs to Spencer,&quot; continued Eric, still holding his girlfriend&#39;s paw, but reaching out with his free paw to start caressing Frieda...<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind sharing either Eric&#39;s cock or my pussy, as long as this stays mutually exclusive just between the three of us,&quot; said Spencer, finishing the statement, while reaching out with her free paw to caress Frieda too.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right about me hoping otherwise, but I honestly didn&#39;t think this would go beyond friendship and making Eric a werepanther,&quot; admitted Frieda. &quot;My folks have these preconceived notions about how a girl, let alone a rich debutante, should behave. They&#39;d freak if they saw the three of us together like this right now outside. They don&#39;t even have sex at any of the werepanther pride meetings. Always so prim and proper in public, and I shudder to think how they would react if they discover I&#39;m bi.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard rich people claim they have it tougher than regular folks on the news sometimes, but usually when they&#39;re up on charges for tax evasion or something. Is it really that rough?&quot; wondered Eric.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know about others, but my folks are always so busy with this charity, that business, this cause, socializing, hobnobbing, and who knows what else, that about the only times I ever see them when they&#39;re not dragging me to something I <i>must</i> attend is either the occasional dinner or each morning when mom makes sure I take my werepanthress birth control pill before she disappears for the day. The household staff have been more of a family to me since I&#39;ve been old enough to attend school than they have,&quot; admitted Frieda. &quot;If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that they support Moon Lake almost as much as the Tachibanas do, I&#39;m sure they would of shipped me off to some fancy prep school ages ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s too bad,&quot; said Spencer, as Eric nodded in agreement. &quot;But you have us now too,&quot; she added, as both of them reached out to hug their friend and lover.<br />
Frieda enjoyed the moment, and the closeness of the new people in her life, before the three of them started trading kisses between each other.<br />
Soon Eric, Spencer, and Frieda were reaching out to caress and play with whatever they could reach with their paws.<br />
Eric soon felt two stroking his cock to further hardness, while each girl teased the other&#39;s clit as well. Eric tried to get his paws into that action too, but only succeeded in feeling the moist outer lips of each vagina as each girl&#39;s fingers dived deeper into her partner.<br />
Instead, he moved one paw up to Frieda&#39;s head, and happily discovered that her panthress ears were just as sensitive as Spencer&#39;s.<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; moaned Frieda, as Spencer noticed what Eric was doing and started playing with the other ear, despite the fact that meant taking her paw away from his hot rod.<br />
&quot;If you two keep that up, I&#39;m gonna cum without Eric&#39;s stiff cock in my cunt, but I want a good long and hard fucking!&quot; cried Frieda.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re wish is my command,&quot; said Eric, briefly pulling away from the ladies. &quot;How do you want me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Always,&quot; teased Frieda, before kissing Spencer. &quot;But this will do for now,&quot; she said, getting on all fours and shaking her furry ass at Eric as she stuck her tail high in the air.<br />
<br />
Eric wasted no time in shifting positions and mounting Frieda from behind. The werepanthress could not help moaning even louder as she felt the hard werepanther cock slide deep into her pussy.<br />
&quot;Oh Spencer, you have yourself one hell of a boyfriend here. He&#39;s definitely a keeper!&quot; said Frieda, as she started moving in time to Eric&#39;s thrusts to join in the sexual dance. &quot;Someday when we have more time, I&#39;ve got to show him anal sex and see if he has any interest, let alone potential skill in it.&quot;<br />
&quot;REALLY?&quot; asked Eric in disbelief, as he felt his penis twitch in response to her statement even as he continued to fuck Frieda. &quot;I&#39;ve heard that was possible, but...&quot;<br />
&quot;Shh. Don&#39;t spoil the moment honey,&quot; advised Spencer, while moving to stroke Frieda&#39;s sensitive ears again, but now just by herself.<br />
&quot;Ever the bookworm, but that&#39;s one of his good points,&quot; said Frieda, as she continued to enjoy the sexual activity.<br />
&quot;One of many,&quot; agreed Spencer, &quot;and you&#39;re enjoying another right now,&quot; she said with a smile, before starting to crawl under Frieda.<br />
<br />
The hybrid were paused to tease and suckle on the werepanthress&#39; breasts for a bit, before continuing to her destination.<br />
Soon she was tasting Frieda&#39;s pussy and Eric&#39;s cock with her tongue, as Frieda leaned forward to fully enjoy Spencer&#39;s honey.<br />
The three horny teenagers tried to hold out as long as they could, but eventually Eric unleashed a load of hot werepanther cum deep into Frieda&#39;s pussy, thus completing his induction into were society, as the ladies licked and sucked each other&#39;s cunts to even more orgasms.</p>
