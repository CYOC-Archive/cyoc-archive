<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;U-uh, go easy on me man.&quot; Jake sheepishly replied, his former confidence sapped by the device working as well as it did. That fact didn&#39;t stop him from grinning internally, seeing his friend in an inhuman form.<br />
<br />
Nathan clicked away on the laptop, navigating through the myriad settings on the Chronivac. His tongue keeps slipping from his muzzle as he pants in excitement. Realizing this quirk, he awkwardly slurps his tongue back into his mouth. Despite being nude, he felt comfortable with dense coat of fur around him. The only issue was hiding his growing erection, which was nearly poking out of his sheath now. He turned away from Jake so he could see it.<br />
<br />
Jake decided to tease him, something he&#39;d soon regret. &quot;What&#39;s taking so long, dog breath?&quot; He chuckled.<br />
<br />
Nathan looked up with a somewhat devilish look on his face. &quot;Oh you&#39;ll see... I have to one-up you, you know.&quot; His tail beat in nervous excitement. This change would be even more extreme than what Jake bestowed onto him, but he deserved it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, that should be good. I think that&#39;s everything.&quot; Nathan placed the laptop on the table and pointed the emitter towards Jake.<br />
<br />
Nathan smiled as he looked at the screen which read these changes:<br />
<br />
Name: Jake<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Species: Squirrel<br />
Body: Human<br />
Age: 18<br />
Height: 1.55 m<br />
Weight: 45 kg<br />
Fur Color: Brown<br />
Eye Color: Brown<br />
<br />
Nathan hit the enter key with his paw, shooting the burst of energy from the emitter into Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here we go, hopefully you were actually nice.&quot; Jake gulped.<br />
<br />
The first change came in as he felt his body rapidly shrink and lose weight. His clothes became much too big for him, but roughly stayed on him, as he was sitting down. Jake lost nearly a foot of height, absolutely dwarfed by Nathan. Jake&#39;s voice climbed higher and higher, causing him to let out a feminine sounding gasp as his Adam&#39;s apple disappeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is this? I thought you&#39;d give me a cool change like I did to you!&quot; Jake stammered, his voice cracking.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s face became slightly rounder, losing his facial hair in the process. His eyelashes grew longer and his lips softer, giving him a feminine touch. His hair lengthened outwards, the short, styled hair giving way to a torrent of somewhat curly brown hair. He pushed it out of his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I need to get to a mirror, this just feels wrong...&quot; Jake sighed as he stood up, his clothes nearly falling off before he caught them. Nathan simply reclined on the couch, smiling in satisfaction.<br />
<br />
As Jake stood up and shuffled over to the mirror, a sharp pain in his chest was felt. His nipples grew far more sensitive, rubbing against his shirt. He stopped and groaned, giving them a small rub. When he looked down in his shirt, he nearly passed out. The flesh around his nipples was slowly growing, extruding out from his body and softening. They stopped at around a medium B-cup, fitting her petite stature. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... Nathan!&quot; Jake yelled.<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; His canine friend responded.<br />
&quot;I. Have. Boobs.&quot; The new woman said in a very annoyed tone. All Nathan could do is laugh.<br />
<br />
Jake rushed to the mirror faster, nearly tripping over his own feet. Upon arrival, his hips cracked, expanding outward to give his body a feminine curve. His thighs and and ass bumped up in size, right before his eyes. They were a little more generous than his chest, giving him a nice firm bubble butt and thighs fitting it, while still being petite. He stared in awe at his body, completely speechless. Just then... a strange feeling manifests in his spine. Instantly, he knew what this pain was, judging by what happened to Nathan earlier. A large, fluffy, brown furred tail erupted out of his backside. It was nearly the length of his entire body, and a little wider than it too. He turned around to grab it, but it involuntarily flicked, escaping his grasp. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is this a squirrel tail?&quot; He questioned Nathan, thinking about how this explains his short stature.<br />
Nathan nodded in response.<br />
<br />
Fur around the base of his tail spread downwards, coating his lower body. As it wrapped around his crotch, a sharp pain was felt that caused him to double over. His male equipment was shrinking rapidly, disappearing amongst his thin layer of fur, replaced by a growing wet slit. He, now a she, plunged her hand into her pants, gasping at the strange heat radiating from her furry crotch. <br />
<br />
&quot;O-okay, this is now WAY more weird...&quot; She blushed intensely.<br />
<br />
Her legs cracked and reshaped, similar to Nathan&#39;s, although the structure of her joints were slightly different. Her feet cramped up, becoming small claws fit for climbing and digging. Her dainty hands followed a similar change, although they kept the human ability to easily grab and manipulate objects. She gasped loudly as her face pulled out, now a short muzzle washed with the brown fur that covered the rest of her body. To complete her changes, her ears stretched out and moved to the top of her head, poking out of her long, voluminous hair in a cutesy way. Her body was overwhelmed by new senses for a few seconds, with heightened hearing, and a sense of smell that only picked up Nathan&#39;s musk.<br />
<br />
Nathan walked up behind her as she looked her body over in the mirror, opening and closing her mouth, as well as swishing her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do you have any cravings for nuts yet?&quot; Nathan teased, scaring Jake.<br />
&quot;Ugh... No, you asshole.&quot; She whipped around, blushing as she had to look up at her friend now.<br />
&quot;Not only does it feel weird to be an animal, it&#39;s even worse to be a girl!&quot; She nervously covered up her body, not having any clothes that fit her anymore. Nathan patted the annoyed squirrel girl on her head, further teasing her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, you suck. Do I get another turn with the Chronivac though?&quot; Jake said as she bent down to pick up her laptop, unintentionally giving Nathan a face full of tail.</p>
