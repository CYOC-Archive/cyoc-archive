<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Richard Van Direstag cautiously made his way through the woods as he entered them, with his feet going over fallen leaves, many of which were a bit moist, though that was really the least of his worries at the moment. And if he weren&#39;t worrying over those things, he would have taken greater not at some of the oddities that were in the woods behind the Van Direstag home. Their back yard wasn&#39;t too big, but their had been a line of trees that started a point that was about fifteen twenty yards behind the back door to the home and ran up to the walled off complex that was to the south of his home. To the northwest of the street that the Van Direstag home was on was another home, though a bit smaller, and the woods that Richard and his wife Rose entered was about the same distance away from the forest as well. In fact that tree line seemed to follow the street in a near straight line behind the back yards on that street, and based on the odd layout of Moon Lake, that area of woodland got wider the further one got from the center of town.<br />
<br />
The biggest oddity was that many of the trees that were in this area weren&#39;t native to Washington state, and many of them were deciduous trees that were rather different from the largely coniferous forests that Richard noted on the drive to Moon Lake. Many of the trees looked as though they were fruit trees that were just planed without care, though there were also some others that were typical in the eastern US but weren&#39;t native to the location. But he and Rose weren&#39;t out to look into the oddity of the flora that made up Moon Lake as a low growling moan rose up from deeper in the woods and carried on the breeze. He gave a glance to Rose, who only pointed in the direction from which the moan was heard and moved toward it. That made Richard sigh as he then moved in the same direction, his mind worrying about what was making that moaning noise, likely a were of some kind, downing something that he would think should have been something private.<br />
<br />
If he&#39;d had his way, they wouldn&#39;t be out here at all. They would be at home waiting out the day and night and preparing to get out of town the moment the sun came out the next day, but frustrated with his plan, Rose had argued and insisted he at least talk to a transformed were. She&#39;d also insisted he&#39;d gone back on his own word to study and learn before making any decision, and initially he had agreed to do so, but that was before he had a series of dreams about himself being involved with some werelioness named &quot;Shelia&quot; and not just with his own wife. A part of him had figured that just being with Rose might not be too bad, if it was just him and her, but the dreams he&#39;d had were very real and very vivid, which he couldn&#39;t explain, and involved him being with someone who was NOT his wife. That was why he&#39;d been thinking up his escape plan, to assure Rose that he was loyal to HER, but he couldn&#39;t admit to her that he was afraid of bad dreams and that made him afraid. She&#39;d think him crazy. But because he couldn&#39;t tell her that, she was insisting on meeting a transformed were and that had them out in the woods, ducking under branches and stepping over fallen logs or rocks that were burried under the layers of leaves.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we&#39;re close,&quot; Rose said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you tell,&quot; Richard answered, &quot;I can barely see anything... it&#39;s dark, the forest here thick... despite that most look like nothing that grows naturally in Washington state. I mean the coniferous trees I think come from Europe... I think. All we&#39;re going by is sound.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s getting louder, so we have to be close,&quot; Rose answered as another growling moan came through the trees. It was a bit uneasy for her, given how sexual the moan was, but given what Richard had been going on about, she had to do something drastic, even if it meant interrupting a were having sex. Though the one thing that puzzled her was that there seemed to be only ONE growling moan. If this were was having sex with another after the sun went down, shouldn&#39;t the other were also be heard moaning as well?<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m afraid of,&quot; Richard mumbled, though not softly enough that Rose couldn&#39;t hear him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you were more willing to learn and not leap to decisions to run away, we wouldn&#39;t be out here!&quot; Rose said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... I&#39;m here for this little experiment,&quot; Richard answered, &quot;just be prepared to book it if this were isn&#39;t interested in conversing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They might be more interested than you know... particularly if you give them the chance,&quot; Rose countered as they walked along finding the sounds, which were now not only growing louder but that they could hear some of the breaths and moans in between the main call that they&#39;d originally heard from their own backyard, which half sounded like &quot;yes... ooohhh… yes...&quot; There again seemed to be only one, and it sounded like the were was on the other side of a large oak tree.<br />
<br />
They came around the tree to find one lone female werelion laying on her back displaying a creamish-gold underbelly while her sides were a golden tan, and Rose figured that would include the werelioness&#39; dorsal side as well. Like Samantha Twist had, this werelioness still had her human hair, even while in her transformed state, which would contrast mundane lions where only the male would have a mane. One paw was massaging and lifting the female&#39;s generous bosom, likely in the D or E cup range, Rose couldn&#39;t tell for sure from the angle they had, up toward  her rounded muzzle with her jaws going up and down slowly with the moan that went along with it. At the same time, her eyes seemed to be sort of fluttering a bit and as Rose looked down, she could soon see why. The lioness&#39; other hand was down and was there between her legs with the pointer and pinkie fingers massaging the fold of furred skin on the outside of her vagina while the middle and ring fingers were slowly working in and out of her vagina. Her tail was also thrashing excitedly and Rose didn&#39;t think the werelioness was even aware that an audience had arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Richard... stand back and let...&quot; Rose began, when Richard tripped as he tried to stop.<br />
<br />
Richard didn&#39;t know what surprised him more, that the were was a werelion or that they&#39;d caught her masturbating in a bed of leaves with her legs spread, as though waiting for a male were to arrive. But other than Rose, there was no one else around. Richard had wanted to stop, but given he&#39;d been trying to move quickly and be ready for any possible attack, he barely noticed a rock that was laying among the leaves. The toe of his shoe hit that rock and Richard found himself falling forward and directly toward the masturbating were. It was only then that the female began to realize she had an audience and removed her fingers from her vagina, but couldn&#39;t fully move to catch Richard, as at the same time the orgasm that she&#39;d been building toward hit. And as Richard fell forward with his mouth partially open, he landed right above her engorged clitoris.<br />
<br />
&quot;OOOAAAAAAUUUUUURRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUU YES!&quot; the werelioness roared as her body shuddered in orgasm<br />
<br />
Richard tried to pull himself up and away, partially afraid and partially embarrassed by all of this. He was embarrassed more because he&#39;d tried to sell himself as an athletic individual and not the sort that would trip over a rock. He was afraid because he knew this was a werelioness and he could taste some of her cream in his mouth and to a certain extent... he&#39;d almost reflexively swallowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;ve heard of loving introductions...&quot; the werelioness breathed as she looked down to Richard, &quot;but... if you were looking to join a pride... you could have called ahead and see what prides would need a new male for their coalition... or if a &quot;new&quot; pride was to be established. The Town Chancellor often helps with those sorts of calls if someone didn&#39;t run into someone already...&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard didn&#39;t say anything at first, though his body was beginning to feel rather warm. He barely noticed when Rose came around the tree a bit more and began to address the werelioness.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t actually come to join any were group,&quot; Rose said slowly, seeing her husband seem to nervously shake a little as he lay by the side of the werelioness female, &quot;it&#39;s just that my husband here was looking at fleeing Moon Lake because of your Mandatory Were Law and without thinking... without bothering to learn anything about Moon Lake. And since we&#39;re new... I figured it best to get him to come out and meet with someone that we could be sure was a were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the Mandatory Were Law should no longer be an issue for you or for your family,&quot; the werelioness spoke as she looked to Richard, who&#39;s eyes had shifted from brown to a bronze/gold color, befitting a werelion. She could also catch some scent of arousal building in him as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Rose gasped and was then even more surprised by what Richard spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I... need... I NEED you,&quot; Richard spoke to the werelioness as his body began to burn with heat and energy.<br />
<br />
He then reached toward the werelioness, his eyes widening a bit to see claws suddenly erupt from their tips, but it wasn&#39;t from any desire to admire himself. It was like he needed her... he needed her to complete him, and with her there and his clothing growing ever more tight around him, tighter than he would have expected. He couldn&#39;t explain it. It felt primal, and as golden tan fur began to grow on his body, the only thing he could think on was being complete and finishing this transformation. He had a bit of trouble as his shoes were suddenly feeling very tight on him, like they were constraining his feet. And as he felt his member growing erect in his pants, the clothes he was wearing were becoming painfully tight on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; the werelioness spoke with a warm and almost apologetic smile, &quot;let me help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose could only stand there in shock and surprise as the werelioness reached down and grabbed the front of Richard&#39;s pants, which were rapidly becoming too small on him. She could see pressure points building from within his shows, that almost looked like individual toes pushing against the inside of the shoe. His shirt was straining to contain the growing muscle that was filling out his body. It was something that she could clearly see was that her husband was physically getting bigger, exceeding the size of a normal human and well surpassing Samantha Twist&#39;s form. She could also not see the golden tan fur, but the darkening of his hair. The gray and silver streaks darkening back into the dark brown that it had always ben, and at the same time it was also moving down the back of his neck and around his neck. As it reached the front of his neck, this new mane grew much thicker than it was elsewhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Richard... you&#39;re... you&#39;re transforming!&quot; Rose stated, sorta dumbstruck at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry...&quot; Richard managed as he struggled his way closer, and managing to kick off his shoes a bit as he moved forward. It hurt a little, but things actually felt a bit better as his shoes were no longer constraining his feet, which were lengthening into digitigrade paws with black colored pads under the toes and the part of the between the toes and the lengthening arch. This was the thing he feared, becoming one of &quot;them&quot; and cheating on Rose in the process, but he couldn&#39;t fight it. As much as he didn&#39;t want to, something seemed to insist that he had to, and the werelioness wasn&#39;t exactly fighting as she quite literally gave a firm pull on his jeans and pulled them off and with his underwear going with it. It revealed a small stub of a tail inching its way out from his spine and a growing penis that was hard and erect and had been painfully straining to get free.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be, okay, big boy,&quot; the werelioness spoke, &quot;you&#39;re getting there... almost done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose could then only watch, with a slight degree of lust building in her, as her husband ripped open his own shirt in his now paw like hands and plunged his growing member into the werelioness&#39; vagina. From there, a pair of growling moans began to rise. One from the werelioness, thrusting her hips up to match Richard&#39;s thrusts down. The other was from Richard as he continued to grow. He hadn&#39;t been much bigger than he was normally, but with his shirt off, she could see that he was still well smaller than the werelioness, and she was very easily bigger than Richard was normally, and better built than Rose was. Rose had decent hips, but they weren&#39;t as wide as the werelioness&#39; and while she could fit into a C cup bra, that was only after three pregnancies. The werelioness was bigger than her in that regard and had far more muscle, but it wasn&#39;t super bulky. It didn&#39;t really detract from the werelioness&#39; femininity.<br />
<br />
And now her husband was growing to match the werelioness&#39; size. His growls and roars joined hers as he thrust powerfully into the werelioness and as his face pushed forward into a longer but still rounded muzzle. For Richard this was a strange mix of pain and pleasure, as his rounded ears slid up to the top of his head, moving the long hair/fur of his mane. The female&#39;s vagina was wrapped around his member tightly and he couldn&#39;t keep himself from thrashing his tail at the pleasure he felt. But now as she&#39;s cum at least once more and as he began to feel his penis twitch inside, the realization of what he was doing began to sink back into his mind. It was then that as he finished his first transformation and let out a triumphant roar while feeling himself erupt into the female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that was good,&quot; the werelioness spoke as Richard pulled himself offer and his penis retreating back into his sheath, &quot;not exactly what or who I was looking for... but good none the less.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did this to me,&quot; Richard said softly, not noticing Rose almost swoon at how deep his voice was, &quot;made me... an Asiatic Werelion... How... how do I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of that is instinct,&quot; the werelioness told him, &quot;now that your transformation is complete... all the associated instinctual bits of knowledge with your new were-species flooding in... It can be odd at first for normals as they process new instincts. That will include instinctual knowledge on all things Panthera Leo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve never been to Asia...&quot; Rose said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ve never been to Africa,&quot; the werelioness spoke, &quot;yet that&#39;s what my fursona is based on... the African Lion. Most werelions have their fursonas based on the African Lion... though a few, like your husband here, have theirs based on the Asiatic Lion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard looked down to his belly for a moment to his belly and then compared it to the werelioness&#39;. On her, he could see the outline of her firm abdominal muscles. On him, while his pectoral muscles were much larger than they once were and his new mane came down to just below his collar bone, his abdomen was rather flat and there wasn&#39;t any bulge... at least until one got to the sheath between his legs. He lifted one hand up and rubbed his stomach, only to find that underneath his skin, his abdominal muscles were there and were very firm, probably more so than he&#39;d ever remembered being. However, it seemed like the skin on his stomach was rather loose, mirroring a  longitudinal fold of skin that the Asiatic Lion had that the African Lion didn&#39;t have.<br />
<br />
&quot;You still did this... I didn&#39;t come here to be changed,&quot; Richard spoke with a low growl, some sense of shame at cheating on his wife in front of his wife coming forward to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;In terms of the one who gave you your dose of were... yes,&quot; the werelioness spoke, &quot;but your wife even said that you were out here to meet a were... which isn&#39;t necessarily to be unexpected. And induction ceremonies for many were groups will often be here in the woods. However, I came out to have a little fun and attract a male werelion. I had no idea that I would attract a pair of new residents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Richard began.<br />
<br />
&quot;We understand,&quot; Rose cut him off, &quot;and my husband tripped... so it wasn&#39;t your fault that this happened. And maybe we should have tried some other way... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your husband took the Mandatory Were Law poorly...&quot; the werelioness answered, remembering what Rose had said earlier, &quot;not something exactly wise... but, it can be understandable, I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard didn&#39;t say anything for the moment, as he got some sense that if he tried to push for justice for himself, Rose might turn on him, though he found himself twitching the tip of his tail a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully the one you found out here was me,&quot; the werelioness answered, &quot;and not a mundane animal moving through the area. A bear or a mountain lion could try to eat you. A generally wouldn&#39;t do that... unless that was something you had interest in...&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Rose tremble a little bit and she drifted toward Richard, &quot;Real bears... I... um... could we go so somewhere more quiet... and talk, miss...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shelia Wiggleston,&quot; the werelioness answered.</p>
