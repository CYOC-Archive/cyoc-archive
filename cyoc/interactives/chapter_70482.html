<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">14 year old Freshman Milton Banks slowly trudged out of his advanced placement math class and headed towards his locker. Life for the young freshman was anything but enjoyable. At just 14 years old, he was beginnign to regret being skipped ahead a couple of grades. His underdeveloped physique was a burden to him, and his nerdish appearance certainly didn't help matters either. Maybe if he had waited, he'd be a little more developed and wouldn't be picked on as he was.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for him, his advanced studies meant he was on a different schedule from everyone else, which limited his interaction with much of the student body to a small degree. As he arrived at his locker and turned the combination, he was surprised when a small sheet of paper fell out. Picking it up, he quickly unfolded it and read the top of the sheet.<br />
<br />
To my new friend,<br />
<br />
You look so sad, standing there. Here's a game to make you smile. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your new friend,&quot; Milton repeated to himself in a high, nasal, stereotypically nerd voice. He casually dismissed the idea that he would have any friends in this place, but at the same time he was always game for this sort of thing, what appeared to be a DND character sheet or something to that effect. Glancing at his watch, he remembered he had a free period of time right now, and decided to fill out the sheet just for fun. Walking over to a nearby bench, he pulled a pen from his pocket and began to read the questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;1. If you were a girl, would your handwriting be nice?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton was taken aback by the question. &quot;What does it matter,&quot; he asked himself. Now that he saw the question, he realized that this was some sort of prank questionnaire. He was about to crumple up the survey and toss it in a trash can when the writing on the paper suddenly vanished, as was replaced by new words.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have already started this questionnaire. All questions must be answered completely or else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton's eyes went as wide as saucers. He was a logical minded person, who, aside from his weekly DND sessions, had no belief in the occult or anything else magical. &quot;Or else what,&quot; he asked aloud. To his surprise the writing on the note faded away again, and was replaced with five simple words.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't want to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton gulped and felt sweat beginning to build on his acne-covered face. &quot;I guess I answer the questions then,&quot; he said aloud, and once again the ominous writing on the page vanished, this time replaced with the questions from before.<br />
<br />
&quot;1. If you were a girl, would your handwriting be nice?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton considered the question for a brief moment. Despite his vast intelligence, his handwriting frankly sucked. His mom had joked that he was a shoe-in for med school because, as she put it, his chickenscratch wasn't suitable for anything else. Deciding that he would want to change that, he scribbled on the page, &quot;My handwriting is not only nice, it is immaculate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;2. If you were a girl, would you like pink?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton was far quicker with his answer here, writing crisply and neatly on the page, &quot;Yes, but not overly so.&quot; He glanced at his answer again, and thought there was something odd about his handwriting, but dismissed it for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;3. If you were a girl, would your hair be straight or curly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton shook his head, remembering the greasy mop of hair that was on his head now. Deciding to go for a more descriptive approach, he wrote out &quot;My hair would be naturally straight and hang down to the top of my rear end, and it would maintain a natural beauty and silky shine to it no matter how dirty it got.&quot; Milton was about to answer the next question when he felt an added weight to his head. He froze in place as the pieces began to add up in his head, and he glanced in a nearby silver trash can in which he could see his reflection. Instead of the black greased moptop that had adorned his skull for much of his teenage life, there was now a long, luxurious fountain of hair hanging from his scalp, shining in the hall light. Milton felt the hair on his head, tugging at it and feeling the pinch when it pulled on his scalp. He glanced down at the questionnaire, noticing that the answers were far more easier to read than anything else he had ever written, and quickly realized what was happening. Whatever he put on the page, happened to him in real life.<br />
<br />
He was about to set aside the survey again, before he lost himself even more, before he stopped himself. He remembered the warning words on the page from before, and having seen what he had seen now paid them far more credence than he would have prior. More than that though, he quickly realized that this was a chance for him to remake his life. He could recreate himself virtually anyway he saw fit, and if he had to become a girl to do that, then so be it. Would it really be that much worse than his life was now? He glanced at the questionnaire and, stealing himself to the process, proceeded forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;4. If you were a girl, what would your favorite color be?&quot;<br />
<br />
That was an easy one to answer. &quot;Light Blue and green, but not too light.&quot; He noted that the ink in his pen began to change to a lighter blue even as he answered the question. <br />
<br />
&quot;5. If you were a girl, what color would your hair be and how would you wear it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton stopped to consider this, and decided on one final test to ensure that his hypothesis was correct. Glancing in the reflective surface of the trashcan as he had done before &quot;The base color of my hair is a light blonde, but is naturally highlighted with various hues of red and orange so that it looks like the color of a sunrise. I usually wear it straight against my back, but sometimes put it in a loose ponytail.&quot; As he finished the answer, Milton was both shocked and elated that the black mane of hair around his head slowly began to lighten and change colors, becoming the exact shades of color he had described on the page. Likewise, a loose ponytail formed around his hair, bunching it together and letting it hang a little higher away from his backside. Milton smiled, and continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;6. If you were a girl, what color would your eyes be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A light glacier blue,&quot; Milton wrote, before feeling a sting in his eyes. A glance in the reflection confirmed his new eye color.<br />
<br />
&quot;7. If you were a girl, what kind of skin color and what kind of complexion would you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton smiled as he read the question, &quot;I would have white skin, but would tan very easily. Never to the point of burning, though. Furthermore, my skin complextion would be permanently clear of any kind of acne or scars that I have or will have.&quot; He looked down at his arm, and saw his pale skin darken considerably, becoming a light tan color in moments. Glancing at the can again, he nearly let out a snorty laugh when he saw that all of the pimples and potmarks that had blemished his face were now gone. Aside from that, his face had become much more female than male, as his nose had shrunk down and his cheekbones had become more pronounced while any facial hair he had was gone. All told, he looked more like a girl than a guy at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;8. If you were a girl, would you wear makeup?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton was starting to get the hang of this as he answered the questions. &quot;Yes, but only to accentuate my natural beauty.&quot; He glanced up again and could detect the faintest hint of foundation on his face, and noticed that he was wearing eyelashes and a small amount of eyeshadow now.<br />
<br />
&quot;9. &quot;If you were a girl, what kind of teeth would you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, this one was easy. Milton wrote, &quot;My teeth would be perfectly straight and cavity free. I have no need of braces or retainers what so ever.&quot; He could literally feel the braces on his teeth melt away into nothingness, leaving his teeth perfectly straight and shining brightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;10. If you were a girl, would you be sporty?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton had to take pause at this question. His stereotypical impression of jocks was that they were bullies and musclebound morons. If anything, he wanted to maintain his level of intelligence. He was about to right now, when he stopped himself. He was literally rewriting reality. He didn't have to be bound by stereotypes. So instead, he wrote &quot;Sporty and athletic, but doesn't play any team sports besides track and field. Rides a bicycle for several miles every weekend and like to run to stay in shape and become a world class track athlete.&quot; He felt a strong tingling across his body, as if every muscle was tensing up and relaxing a hundred times a second. He glanced down at his arms and felt them become stronger, but not overly muscular. A similar situation happened to his abdomen and torso area. But he could feel the strength grow in his legs, as they became longer and thinner, but at the same time very powerful, like a sprinter would have. As a side effect, he noted this his waist had collapsed in on itself while his hips had widened, giving him the appearence of an hourglass figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;11. If you were a girl, would you wear a skirt?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton considered it for a moment, before answering &quot;Yes, but I'm also comfortable wearing pants or shorts.&quot; He felt a draft across his legs and looked down to see that he was now wearing a light blue miniskirt. He marveled at the long feminine legs he now possessed, and feeling the tight calf muscles within them.<br />
<br />
&quot;12. If you were a girl, would you wear high heels?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton answered &quot;Only on formal occasions. Otherwise I wear normal girl's running shoes.&quot; His feet quickly shrunk down to a women's size 6.5 and his black hightops turned into white running shoes with pink highlights in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;13. If you were a girl, would you wear jewelry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I always wear a normal ladies watch except when I'm competing. Otherwise I usually wear simple gold earrings and sometimes a gold cross around my neck.&quot; Even as he wrote this, the items appeared out of nowhere on his being.<br />
<br />
&quot;14. If you were a girl, would you have any other accessories like glasses or hairbands?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton smiled, and wrote on the page. &quot;I don't ever wear glasses because I have better than 20/20 vision.&quot; There was a brief sensation across his eyes again, and then everything was incredibly blurry. Milton removed the coke bottle glasses from his face and cast them into the trash can, making use of it other than as a reflective surface. He noted that he could see with greater clarity than he had ever done before.<br />
<br />
&quot;15. If you were a girl, what size breasts would you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
Here was a point of no return, Milton thought. He had always been a large breast man, but didn't want to deal with the problems large breasts brought. Deciding he wanted to look very attractive, but still be functional, he carefully wrote on the sheet. &quot;I have E cup breats that are perfectly firm and don't sag. Furthermore, my weight training his given me the upper body muscles to support breasts of this size, and even their movement while I'm running doesn't bother me or affect my speed in anyway.&quot; He felt a strong sensation on his chest, and watched as large mounds of flesh began to swell from their simultaneously he could feel his upper body actually get stronger with the passing seconds, and the weight from the large breasts quickly faded away.<br />
<br />
&quot;16. If you were a girl, would you be attracted to guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton thought for several moments. He wasn't gay, that much was certain, but he was curious about certain aspects of sexuality. Deciding to keep his options open for the most part, Milton wrote &quot;I am primarily heterosexual, but would be open to the idea of a threesome or lesbian sex.&quot; As he wrote it, his mind drifted to some of the guys on the track and field team...and some of the girls, and lustful thoughts appeared. His small dick, the last bastion of his quickly diminishing manhood, made itself known as it became erect, and Milton had to wonder how much longer it would last.<br />
<br />
&quot;17. If you were a girl, what kind of shirt would you be wearing right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another easy question. &quot;I'd be wearing something that matches the skirt I'm wearing now, because of my clear understanding of fashion.&quot; Before his eyes the simple white polo shirt he was wearing morphed into a light blue tanktop that matched the skirt he had given himself before, giving him and excellent view of his finely toned midriff and of the cleavage he now possessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;18. If you were a girl, would you shave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Milton wrote, before adding, &quot;Though I rarely have to because my leg, pubic and armpit hair is very sparse and doesn't grow very fast. A wave of tingling came over him, and he glanced down at his marvelous legs to find that all the hair that had been there was gone. A quick check of his arms revealed the same, and he noticed that in the process his hands had shrunk as well, and quarter inch nails now stood out on his thinner fingers, polished with a light pink color.<br />
<br />
&quot;19. If you were a girl, would you use tampons or a pad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton bit his bottom lip and realized that this was truly the point of no return. Glancing around to see if anyone was watching (and silently thanking that no one had up to this point) and eager to see the transformation, Milton slowly lowered one hand into his skirt and felt around for his small, erect penis. After he found it, he wrote on the paper &quot;Tampons.&quot; All at once, he felt his small shaft shrink inwards, and pulled his hand back when he felt his balls shrivel up and slink back into his body. At that moment Milton knew that he, was now a she. She felt a thin object inside of herself, and memories told her that was a tampon. She remembered that she was currently on her cycle, and would be for another couple of days.<br />
<br />
&quot;20. If you were a girl, what kind of underwear would you wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton quickly wrote on their, feeling much more confident now that his transformation was for all intents and purposes complete &quot;I usually wear simple silk panties or bikini briefs. I will wear a thong on the beach though, if I feel like showing off.&quot; She could feel her boxer shorts shrink down and become far smoother against her skin as they became a simple light blue pair of panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;21. If you were a girl, what kind of bra would you wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A sports bra,&quot; Milton wrote, almost speaking it aloud at the same time, but stopping when she remembered she had yet to change her voice, &quot;But right now I am wearing a lacy light blue thing that matches my panties.&quot; A soft fabric suddenly appeared around her breasts, cradling them and making them feel even lighter than they had before. <br />
<br />
&quot;22. If you were a girl, what would your intelligence be on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being a ditzy bimbo and 10 being a supergenius?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton was a bit of a showoff when it came to her intelligence. So without hesitation she wrote a 15 on their, partially as a joke. In mere moments though her mind was suddenly filled with knowledge that even made her previously prodigious intellect seem miniscule in comparison. Smiling, she continued on.<br />
<br />
&quot;23. If you were a girl, how would you sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a soft soprano voice, that is a very good singing voice.&quot; Milton felt a tingle in her throat and coughed, smiling when she heard the lighter lilt of her voice in the process. &quot;This is more like it,&quot; she confidently said, eager to finish the life changing questionnaire.<br />
<br />
&quot;24. If you were a girl, what would your age, height and weight without clothes be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milton already knew that she wanted to be older, to escape the monotony of high school faster, but still wanted to be able to enjoy as much of her youth as possible. &quot;I'd be 16 but be a senior in high school due to skipping grades. I'd be 6'1&quot; tall and weigh just under 125 pounds without clothes.&quot; She suddenly felt taller as she grew a large six inches from her previously miniscule height, nearly all of it going to her luxurious legs. She saw that she had a purse next to her with a set of car keys shining inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;25. Final question. If you were a girl, what would your name be?&quot;<br />
<br />
This was probably the easiest question of all, she decided, having long ago picked out a name for her new life. &quot;My name would be Evangeline Jennifer Banks, but all my friends either call me Eve or EJ for short.&quot; She glanced down at the paper, and the questions all faded, becoming a simple note. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for your participation. To live a happy life as you've written it, pass me on to the next person. Boy or girl, it doesn't matter.&quot; Not wanting to screw this up, Evangeline saw a boy walking down the hallway, the first person she had seen since this whole thing began. Standing up and smiling with her new life, she surreptitiously stuck the note of paper into the boy's partially open backpack and walked away, humming to herself with her new wonderful life ahead of her.</p>
