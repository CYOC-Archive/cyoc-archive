<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ted was nothing like the outdoorsman his namesake was.  He knew nothing about camping or hiking and he was a skinny young man; tall and lanky.  He was distantly related to the famous Theodore Roosevelt; a 4th cousin on his father’s side of the family.<br />
<br />
As Ted, and it was Ted or Theodore not Teddy, struggled he heard voices.  Three deep voices talking about going to the fire.<br />
<br />
“Firefighters!  Thank God!”  Ted thought.  He called out.  “Over here!  I need some help!  It’s dark and I’m stuck.”  Ted would gladly suffer the embarrassment if he could just get out of this mess.  The voices stopped, he heard murmuring and then there was an answer to his call.<br />
<br />
“We’ll be right there.  Sing a song or something so that we can locate you by the sound of your voice.”  A deep bass voice said.<br />
<br />
“OK.”  Ted said.  “Great!”  He thought, “Now I’ll embarrass myself further by singing!”  But Ted started singing ‘Row, Row, Row Your Boat’.  It was the only song that came to mind outside of ‘Stairway to Heaven’ and he wasn’t going to embarrass himself further by singing all the guitar parts.<br />
<br />
Two to three minutes later, he heard the firemen approaching his camp.  He could barely make out that there were three, tall burly guys.  The tree cover was very dense were he and his buddies had camped and the moon just wasn’t making it through the trees.<br />
<br />
“OK, you can stop singing now, we found you.” One of the firefighters said.<br />
<br />
“I’m so glad you guys happened by.  There’s been an accident down the road and I was supposed to be packing up camp.  I got all tangled up in the tents as you can see.  I’m… really new at this, this is my first camping trip.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s get the kid untangled.”  He heard another say.<br />
<br />
The third one chuckled a little and said, “It’s OK, son, you should have seen me try to put up a tent the first time I camped.” <br />
<br />
In a few minutes, strong hands were lifting Ted up and other strong hands were untangling his legs and arms.  They stood him up and Ted reached out a hand to shake and thank the fireman who had lifted him up.<br />
<br />
The fireman took his hand and Ted thought his gloves felt strange.  Since when did firemen wear padded gloves with fur on the backs?<br />
<br />
“Th-thanks!  I’m so embarrassed.”  Ted said.<br />
<br />
A light came on, one of the Coleman battery operated ones Carl had brought.  One of the firefighters must have switched it on.<br />
<br />
It the light Ted was amazed and terrified to find three bears standing around him.  He felt like he was having a nightmare.  Then one of them, he sounded like the leader, spoke.<br />
<br />
“So, where’s the accident?”  <br />
<br />
Ted pointed in a direction down the road, or at least he thought that was the right direction, he wasn’t any better at directions than he was at taking down tents in the dark.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think it’s that way, Dick.”  Another of the bears said, “That’s the direction we just came from.”<br />
<br />
“OK, Ron, I guess we’ll just have to follow the scent of burning rubber, those tires stink to a human nose, with our recent augmentations, finding it shouldn’t be that hard.”<br />
<br />
Ted had had enough.  This wasn’t a dream, he knew that, but bipedal, anthropomorphic bears cooperating with each other to put out a fire was just too much.  He needed to know who and what they were.<br />
<br />
“Who are you guys and WHAT are you guys?”  Ted said, interrupting the conversation.<br />
<br />
“Oh, right, it must be just a bit like the Twilight Zone for you.  I’m Dick.  I’m a scientist and this is Ron my assistant.”  Dick, who was apparently the leader, cocked his thumb and pointed it at the other bear with a gesture.  “The big strong silent one over there is Smokey, or at least that’s what he likes to be called.”  Smokey grunted, nodded and smiled a toothy smile.  “So what’s your name?”  Dick asked.<br />
<br />
“Ted… Ted Roosevelt…” Ted paused for the inevitable.<br />
<br />
“You don’t say?”  Dick said as Ron chuckled a little.  “Well, it’s a pleasure Mr. Roosevelt.  Your namesake was good to our kind and now were here, apparently, to return the favor.”  Dick said with a bit of a laugh.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t the response Ted had expected.<br />
<br />
“Look, Dick, we gotta get going.”  Ron said in a deep gravely.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but we need to leave someone here to protect the kid, no telling what’s out here or who.”  Dick said.<br />
<br />
“I’ll stay with him.”  Smokey offered, “You wanted me to hang back anyway.”<br />
<br />
“OK, Dick said.”  Then he turned back to Ted. “Is that OK, with you.  I promise you, Smokey here is a good sort as all three of us are and when we get back from the accident, I’ll tell you what I can about what we are.  I’d ask you to keep it quiet when you get back to ‘civilization’ if you would?  Could you do that?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, sure!”  Ted sincerely meant it too.  “Who’d believe me anyway?”<br />
<br />
“You’d be surprised.”  Ron answered.<br />
<br />
“Smokey, if someone comes, hid you and Ted here until you know who it is, OK?”  Dick said.<br />
<br />
“OK.”  Smokey said.<br />
<br />
With that, Ron and Dick headed off through the woods.<br />
<br />
Ted sat in one of the camp chairs and looked Smokey over.  Ted was really into furries; he loved the art.  He particularly liked the bear furries, mostly because he’d grown up with the Teddy Roosevelt stories and imagined himself with the bears in the woods.  He’d even sort of hoped to see bears on this trip, from a safe distance of course; now, like a fantasy come true, here was a furry standing not five feet from him.<br />
<br />
“So,” Ted said tentatively, “Were you born like that?”  Ted realized just how rude it was to ask such a question, like asking a blind person if they were born that way.<br />
<br />
“No,” the bearman said, “This morning I was just a normal bear, something happened while I was asleep.  I woke up in pain and realized I was changing.  Now, I’m like you.” Smokey said.<br />
<br />
Ted’s mind exploded with questions, but he said the next without thinking.  “What about Dick and Ron?  Were they bears this morning too?”<br />
<br />
“No.”  Smokey said, “this morning Dick was a man and so was Ron, like you are.”<br />
<br />
Ted couldn’t resist the next question, “How did they become… bears or bear-men?”<br />
<br />
“It’s because of me.  I was curious.  I mated with Dick and he changed and Dick and I mated with Ron and he changed.  Ron wasn’t happy at first, but he seems to like what he is now.”  Smokey said.<br />
<br />
“Why wasn’t he happy?”  Ted asked.<br />
<br />
“He was afraid.  He didn’t want to become a monster.  But he doesn’t think of us as monsters now.  Do you think I’m a monster?”  Smokey asked with a genuine look of interest.  Smokey spoke with the frankness and honesty of a child.<br />
<br />
“No!”  Ted said, “I think you’re a dream come true!  So, Ron and Dick were both humans this morning and you changed them by mating with them?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, they were humans, but I only changed Dick and I didn’t know that mating with him would do change him.  Dick mated with Ron and while Ron was changing, I mated with him too.”  Smokey said.<br />
<br />
Ted knew this was an opportunity that would probably never come along again.  To Hell with college; to Hell with the rat race!  Ted wanted to be a bearman and if that meant being fucked up the ass by this big hairy stud, that’s was well worth it.  Besides, Ted, thought, I’ve always wanted to try sex with a male.<br />
<br />
“Smokey,” Ted said, “would you mate with me too.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I like to mate!”  Smokey said with a lustful smile.<br />
<br />
Ted removed his clothes, if the change happened as fast as he thought; they’d be way too constricting in just a few minutes.  He walked over to Smokey and started petting his chest.  Smokey in turn started petting Ted’s shoulders and chest and face.  Ted reached down and began to stroke Smokey’s growing cock and he noticed with some surprise that he too was getting hard.  Smokey bent his head down and started licking Ted’s face, like a puppy would.  Ted opened his mouth and the bearman began to lick in his mouth.  Soon, Ted stood naked, pressed against Smokey’s body, rubbing his cock in the bear’s fur and French kissing the beast.<br />
<br />
“How do you want to mate with me?”  Ted asked.<br />
<br />
“Like bears do.”  Smokey said.<br />
<br />
Ted took the bearman by the paw and moved over to one of the tents that hadn’t been broken down for packing.  He went into the tent and got into the doggy position on the sleeping bag.  He spread his legs wide and said, “OK, Smokey, mate with me.”<br />
<br />
Smokey didn’t need to be told twice.  In minutes he was rubbing his precum into Ted’s asshole and minutes after that he began to fuck Ted.<br />
<br />
Ted grunted and held in his cries of pain.  He was going to take this like a man.  For a good thirty minutes the pair fucked and then Smokey exploded inside of Ted.  Ted felt the warm rush within his guts and the thoughts of what he was to become alone caused his cock to spew out gobs of thick cum.  Ted realized, though, that he did enjoy the experience and looked forward to being mated when he too was a bearman.  Smokey eased himself down onto Ted and pulled his arms and legs next to Ted’s naked body, covering him in a blanket of his own fur.  Ted felt the bear’s hard cock still deep inside of him and the warmth of the bearman’s sperm was spreading out from Ted’s guts.  Ted felt his balls begin to tingle, pleasantly.  He sighed, smiled and began to doze, thinking about his the furry body he’d soon have and how nice Smokey smelled.</p>
