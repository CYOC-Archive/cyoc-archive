<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janelle strode into the building and moved directly to the classroom. She walked with an abundance of natural confidence and even though she was dressed so provocatively, she didn&#39;t mind the numerous stares at all. It actually was the opposite. She relished in their lecherous gazes. Her tail twitched excitedly as she added a little extra sway to her step to really accentuate her perfect ass and hips for their enjoyment.<br />
<br />
As she entered the lecture hall, she took a quick glance around the room and noticed that it was mostly male students who were attending her class. She didn&#39;t mind that, as it was very much expected. What did surprise her was the handful of girls who also were in attendance. Each one of them was pretty in their own way, though she herself was still a league above all of them. With that in mind, Janelle set her purse down and took her place behind the podium and began her class. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome all of you to the first day of Modern Erotics 101. Yes, I said Erotics. Not Ethics, not Economics. Erotics, as in sex stuff. If any of you are in the wrong class, leave now please.&quot;<br />
<br />
No one left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent. Now then, let&#39;s begin with explaining the rules and some information. For starters, as you can see, I am not a normal human. I am a bunny girl. Many of you likely are thinking that this is some kind of costume or uniform. It is not. These ears and my tail are all very real, and are all a part of my body. Observe.&quot; She then moved her ears about to demonstrate. This got pretty much everyone&#39;s instant attention. Even those who were half or fully asleep were woken up by the commotion.<br />
<br />
Janelle gave her students a moment to quiet down before she continued with explaining the rules. &quot;Now that I have all of your attention, we can begin today&#39;s lesson. So, the rules of my class are simple and for the most part should be common sense. Rule 1, keep it consensual, obviously. Rule 2, my word trumps all unless it breaks rule 1. Rule 3, unless I say otherwise, contraceptive measures are to be taken and/or used every time. Aside from those 3, there are not any other hard set rules, though some situational or temporary rules may be added if needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the older male students, maybe 20 year old, raised his hand. Janelle saw it and let him ask his question. &quot;So, hypothetically speaking, if those are the only rules, if I were to ask you if I can fuck you right here and now, and I also have a condom on, is that allowed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of the students began to giggle at the question, but to their surprise, Janelle just nodded and replied without batting an eye. &quot;Of course, do you want to rephrase that as not a hypothetical question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then by all means, you can fuck me while I continue on with the lecture. But you will have to settle with doing it from behind.&quot;<br />
<br />
That response made the room dead silent. Janelle cocked her head in confusion after nothing happened for over half a minute. &quot;What&#39;s the hold up? I already agreed to let you fuck me, so come down here already.&quot;<br />
<br />
The male student, with his face a little red, got up and walked down to the podium platform. Janelle then confirmed that he had a working, fresh condom on. Then she spread apart her legs and bent over. The man&#39;s eyes widened when he noticed the black bottom of the leotard Janelle was wearing had a form fitted hole that perfectly conformed around the lips of her pussy. And only when she got into this kind of a posture, would it be able to be noticed by others due to the intricate design of the clothing.<br />
<br />
Janelle pulled aside her left asscheek in order to be more inviting to her male suitor and raised her tail a bit higher too. The man grabbed her hips and slid his errection right into her pussy, causing Janelle to let out a breathy moan. Her student began to pick up speed, so she grabbed the sides of the podium and wrapped her legs around his back. She trapped him like this so that he wouldn&#39;t try toying around with her durring her lecture. <br />
<br />
Janelle just began her first lecture, completely ignoring what was happening between her legs aside from a few stray moans and gasps. Even her voice stayed steady for the most part. She was standing on her hands while the man held her legs around his waist. <br />
<br />
At one point, the man got the idea to try unzipping Janelle&#39;s corset but was met with the tip of her left heel jabbing into his cheek before he could even touch the zipper. &quot;Rule 1&quot; was all Janelle had to say for the man to quickly placed his hand back underneath her thigh and continued thrusting away.<br />
<br />
After a few more seconds of sex, the man finally came, filling the condom with his warm jizz. Janelle released her legs from around his waist and he pulled out of her. He was about to leave when Janelle stopped him. &quot;Hold it, I will be taking that from you.&quot; She said as she grabbed the tied condom from him, then sent him back to his seat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, you all just watched me get fucked for the last few minutes, and here is the outcome.&quot; Janelle held out the filled condom for the class to see. She then untied it and let a little bit of it drip onto her finger. &quot;There is several tens of millions of sperm cells right here. That&#39;s enough sperm in this tiny drop to theoretically impregnate every women in the entire USA. Of course that is impossible due to the absolutely abysmal fertilizing rate of sperm, as only one cell per egg is typically allowed, and that&#39;s not mentioning the logistical nightmare needed to do so. But yeah, this is why we wear protective contraceptives. Now, you should all be aware that precum also contains sperm cells. There is less, but still more than enough to get pregnant with. So <i>just pulling out</i> isn&#39;t entirely fool-proof. You also may not impregnate a woman with every attempt. It is a game of chance most of the time. And depending on several factors, including things like diet, genetic health, and the timing of the menstrual cycle, your odds of conceiving a child may rise or fall accordingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Semen, while hardly enough to support a healthy diet, is edible. It predominantly is protien, so there isn&#39;t necessarily any worry about swallowing if you get some in your mouth, like this.&quot; Janelle then sticks the drop into her mouth, along with the rest of what is left within the condom and swallows it. &quot;It usually has a salty taste to it, and certain foods, like fruit, can alter the flavor to an extent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, semen, being a protein based substance, isn&#39;t easy to get out of things like hair and clothing when using warm water. However, if you switch to using cold water, it will become realitively easy to remove. Using warm or hot water also greatly increase the chances of leaving a stain in fabrics, and the sooner you attend to it, the better.&quot; <br />
<br />
After letting the student&#39;s finish taking notes, Janelle switched gears from lecturing about facts over to practical knowledge and applications. Walked out from behind the podium and addressed the class. &quot;Now then, who wants...&quot;</p>
