<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When it was obvious that mom wasn&#39;t home and she wasn&#39;t going to be able to get Jeff in trouble, Lisa grew bored with the whole idea. Deciding to go over to a friend&#39;s house, the fourteen year old girl, called around, found out Penny was home, and made plans to hang out with the other teenage girl. Grabbing her coat and purse, she passed Tyler on the way out, who told her, &quot;Mom and dad&#39;ll be home in a bit. They what to sit down with the three of us and have a talk about something.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fourteen year old girl not the least interested in what her younger brother had to say, or what it was their parents wanted to talk about, she brushed a curly lock of dark brown hair from her forehead, commented, &quot;Whatever,&quot; and left.<br />
<br />
Hours later she returned with Penny. The two having had to leave Penny&#39;s place because the girl&#39;s younger siblings starting to drive the up the walls, they decided to first head to Lisa&#39;s place, then down to the mall afterward. Not seeing her parent&#39;s cars in the driveway, Lisa let herself in the house. Finding it dark and silent, she wondered where Jeff and Tyler were, if they&#39;d left to go to a friend&#39;s house or, in the case of Jeff, to his girlfriend&#39;s, the two jumped when something screamed like a woman in pain. Uttering a nervous titter, Penny stated, &quot;I think someone ran over a cat&#39;s tail or something,&quot; as she slammed the front door.<br />
<br />
Not the least convinced, Lisa dropped her house keys and purse on the table, shook her head, and countered, &quot;I dunno. That sound like it came from inside the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think someone left the television on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s something Tyler or Jeff is running on their computer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we should go check it out? You know, just to make sure it isn&#39;t anything in the house, and that it was something outside?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;ll we do if we walk in on the freaks, or even one of them, and find them watching porn?&quot; Lisa inquired, to which Penny twisted her face in a look of disgust and answered, &quot;Gross. Doesn&#39;t your parents say anything about them doing something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod in response, and Lisa got an idea. Wanting to catch either Jeff or Tyler looking up inappropriate stuff on their laptop so she could tell mom, dad, or both, she gave her friend a mischievous smile, much like her younger brother would when he was up to something. Pressing a finger to her lips, she hissed, &quot;Let&#39;s try and catch them in the act,&quot; before she crept across the hall and toward the bedrooms with Penny following behind.<br />
<br />
Inside Jeff&#39;s room, the vixen, after she&#39;d let forth another call for a male, froze when she heard the door slam. Body tense, legs splayed, head low, ears pricked, she switched her tail back and forth as she sniffed the air and listened to her surroundings. Able to tell by odour alone there were two humans nearby, and that they were drawing close, she leapt off the desk and started to pace about. Looking for a way out, and not finding one, she almost cried out when someone began to hammer on the door. Not knowing this, or the source of the noise, only that it frightened her and she wanted to get away, she squirted a line of piss onto the floor and dove under the bed. Crouching low, she peered out, waiting to see what would happen as the noise that had scared her continued.<br />
<br />
At first, her plan had been to sneak up to Jeff&#39;s room and throw the door open. But, upon reaching the older boy&#39;s bedroom, Lisa instead pressed an ear against the door and listened. Hearing the sound of something from within, but unable to tell what, she glanced at Penny. Still grinning mischievously, she mouthed, &quot;Follow my lead,&quot; and when the other girl nodded, she proceeded to hammer on the door.<br />
<br />
How long she did this, she did not know. But after awhile she got another idea as she called out in a fairly passable imitation of a man&#39;s voice, &quot;Police! Open up. We know you&#39;re watching porn in there,&quot; which caused Penny to lapse into a fit of giggles.<br />
<br />
Before the other could get completely out of control with her laughter, Lisa threw the door open, calling out, &quot;Busted,&quot; as she did so, but became disappointed when instead of catching Jeff, or even Tyler, doing anything dirty, she instead found herself looking at her older brother&#39;s empty bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuck!&quot; Penny exclaimed as she peered in and sniffing the air, she inquired, &quot;What does he do in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa didn&#39;t want to know, and felt her friend didn&#39;t either. Voicing her stance on the matter, she spotted the laptop, still turned on and the Chronivac programme still running. Wanting to know what her brother had been doing, she stepped into the room and towards the computer, but stopped when she spotted the drying mess on the carpet, turned to say something to Penny, but didn&#39;t when she saw the same thing she&#39;d seen on the floor on the bed. No stranger to vaginal discharge, or, because of health class, male cum, she proclaimed, &quot;That&#39;s just disgusting. You&#39;d think boy&#39;s would have at least some decency to clean up after themselves,&quot; as she directed Penny&#39;s attention to the bed, then the floor.<br />
<br />
Her friend wrinkled her nose and stared at the dark spot on the carpet. Sure that it was the source of the stench of the room, she was about to ask when Lisa asked, &quot;What&#39;s this,&quot; and turning to look in the direction, she watched as her friend pointed at the laptop screen. Joining the other, she studied the pulled up window and after a moment, Penny said, &quot;Looks like a game of some sort.&quot;<br />
<br />
She knew her younger brother was a freak, as she didn&#39;t know anyone else who&#39;d been born with the tail of a fox. But as she agreed with what the other had commented, Lisa couldn&#39;t help thinking that Tyler was a bigger weirdo than she&#39;d believed, as what she read on the screen seemed to be a drawn up character of her brother as a full vixen. Reaching down to tap a few buttons, she stopped when Penny hissed, &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; and giving the other girl a look, Lisa countered, &quot;It&#39;s just a stupid game my brothers have been playing,&quot; before she hit the keystrokes she&#39;d been intending and watched a second window pop up.<br />
<br />
As Penny whispered, &quot;They&#39;re going to be pissed if they find out you&#39;ve been messing with it,&quot; Lisa couldn&#39;t help herself as she burst out laughing when she read the profile of a brother as a sex doll. Failing to understand it was more than a profile, Lisa screamed out, &quot;Oh, this is too perfect. My older brother wants to be a sex object, and my baby brother wants to be a female fox in heat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Under the bed, the vixen that had been Tyler heard all of this, but didn&#39;t understand. Wanting to escape out through the new opening, but frightened by the noises and that she may be caught, she edge further under the bed until she was at the head of it. Curling herself up in an effort to make herself as small a target as possible, she waited for the right moment in which to flee, her need for a mate still strong, but put asied for the moment in the interest of self-preservation.<br />
<br />
Penny thought it also a total riot when she heard what Lisa&#39;s brother&#39;s had created. Tears streaming down her cheeks, she said, &quot;Hey. What say we have some fun with their little programme?&quot; and when Lisa agreed, then asked, &quot;How?&quot; the fourteen year old girl, no longer caring if the two older boys would be angry at them for messing around with their game, reached down and hit several keystrokes. Calling up a few boxes, she read the information within, decided to try to experiment to see what could be done and what couldn&#39;t, and on Tyler&#39;s profile, she altered the awareness so that it made what she assumed was a fox character totally sentient and with a average to slightly above average intelligence of a human. Hitting first the accept key and next the permanency option, she read a dialogue box that asked if she wanted to effect reality or just the transformed. Selecting just the transformed, she didn&#39;t wait to see what the programme would or wouldn&#39;t do as she instead pulled up Jeff&#39;s profile.<br />
<br />
A series of inputs and she changed him from a sex doll to a doubled headed pink dildo that was ribbed and had an option to be filled with a lubrication for ease of penetration. Laughing at this, Lisa reached past her friend and made one end knobbed like a dog&#39;s dick and the other barbed like a cat&#39;s. Making sure the barbs were soft and would cause as much stimulation as the ribbing would, she asked, &quot;How long should we make it?&quot;  to which her friend suggested fourteen inches long. Entering this information,  as well stuff for width and girth, giggling all the while as she did, she hit the accept button, selected for it to effect only the transformed, and was surprised when the programme informed her, &quot;Permanency turned on. Reality shall not be effected. Only the transformed will be aware of the changes. Changes cannot be undone,&quot; before it blinked and a new box appeared that read, &quot;Scanning,&quot; which was followed by another blink and two new profiles appeared on the screen, one of Lisa, the other of Penny.<br />
<br />
The two girls unaware of what they&#39;d done to Tyler and Jeff, stared in confusion at the screen. As each found it strange that all sort of data was being displayed, including stuff they&#39;d never told anyone, under the bed the vixen squirmed as an immense pressure squeezed her head. Her animal brain going through several million years worth of evolution, all she was able to think after a bit was, &quot;What the fuck is happening to me?&quot;</p>
