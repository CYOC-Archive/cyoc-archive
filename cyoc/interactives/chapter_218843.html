<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“She is too wounded to move.” Stated Baal “I have too many battle wounds, that is someone who can’t be moved without killing her.”<br />
<br />
“So call an Angel doctor.” Yelled Maisy through her tears.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think any Angel can heal her.” Whispered Michael softly as everyone looked at him. “The Doctors in heaven deal with Angels and while we can heal much, they deal with Angels not Demons.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Said Lucifer his voice filled with sadness.<br />
<br />
“What does that mean?” inquired Josh<br />
<br />
“If we call down an Angel doctor, they wouldn’t know how to deal with demon biology.” Explained Lilith<br />
<br />
“I certainly wouldn’t know how to deal with Angel Biology.” Confirmed the Doctor<br />
<br />
“But doesn’t God and Lucifer share a granddaughter, doesn’t mean that the biology between Angel and demons are…” offered up Josh<br />
<br />
“You would think, but no one thought it was possible for an angel and a demon to have a kid before she was born.” Explained Lilith “I guess all we have, is hope.”<br />
<br />
“Wait…what was your theory?” inquired Maisy as she looked toward Penemune who was now attempting to hide as all eyes turned toward the shy bookish angel.<br />
<br />
“Well…it is more of a story.” Admitted Penemune looking down at the floor.<br />
 <br />
“A story?” inquired Astaroth with stern glare. “We don’t have time for stories.”<br />
<br />
“Go on.” Ordered Lucifer as he saw that his daughter was reaching for every lifeline possible. He wasn’t going to crush her hope if he could help it.<br />
<br />
“Well, in one of the journals from the fall of Arcadia there is a story about a demon who was saved from a wound almost like this.” Explained Penemune.<br />
<br />
“I was at the conquest of Arcadia.” stated Astaroth, she was as highly placed in hell as she was because not only was she Lucifer’s sister, but she was the one who led the armies of Hell in the uprising to take the 2nd city in Heaven, Arcadia. “A wound like this…”<br />
<br />
“Please, don’t say fatal.” pleaded Maisy as she looked at her Aunt with tears in her eyes, causing Astaroth to stop dead in her tracks. “Please…don’t.”<br />
<br />
“What do you need.” Stated Lucifer, he didn’t believe in stories either but he wasn’t going to crush his daughter’s hopes.<br />
<br />
“A glass vile.” stated Penemune as everyone looked at her somewhat confused but she quickly got a glass vile. <br />
<br />
She took a deep gulp and walked toward Maisy before grabbing her by the head and tilting her head back.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” inquired Baal his hand on his weapon.<br />
<br />
“In the story, it says two demons lovers where doing battle in the city when one of them came across his angel brother.” Explained Penemune as she collected the tears from Maisy. That wasn’t hard, the Princess was crying like she never had before. <br />
<br />
“The two brothers did battle while the demon’s wife was fighting another angel.” Explained Penemune as she walked toward Josh whose face was also streaked with tears. <br />
<br />
“When the demon brother was struck down by the angel brother both he and his true love cried over the wound together.” Explained Penemune as she tilted Josh’s head and let his angel tears mix with the demonic tears. “The journal goes on to say that the tears of true love of a demon and of true love of an angel mixed together to heal the wound.”<br />
<br />
“That has to be crazy?” stated Lilith.<br />
<br />
“And yet?” inquired Penemune as she held up the vile which was now glowing a light purple color as the tears from beings from Heaven and Hell mixed together into something new. “This isn’t something that is supposed to happen when you mix tears.”<br />
<br />
“Put it on.” ordered Lucifer as Penemune moved to stand over toward where Rachel was lying. <br />
<br />
“Open the wrappings.” Ordered the Doctor as a nurse unwrapped the wrappings holding back the blood from the massive wound on Rachel’s stomach. Rachel winced in pain, too weak to even scream as Penemune gave a personal prayer before pouring the liquid down on the wound.<br />
<br />
The room began to fill with a purplish light, as before everyone’s eyes the wound began to quickly heal. The demonic and heavenly tears pushing back death together and healing the wound. <br />
<br />
“I can’t believe that worked.” Stated Penemune<br />
<br />
“My God.” said Michael in pure shock and disbelief at what his own eyes where looking upon.<br />
<br />
“I don’t believe it.” Said Astaroth<br />
<br />
“Thank you.” Said Josh both to God and to Penemune.<br />
<br />
“That makes no sense.” stated the Doctor, not believing what his own eyes where seeing. “The wound is healing totally.”<br />
<br />
“It does it your God.” Laughed Lucifer shaking his head. “If someone is loved by both Heaven and Hell, they deserve to be saved. Sounds like something that SOB would do.”<br />
<br />
Overwhelmed with emotion, Maisy couldn’t stay in the room as she moved out into the lobby area to let the tears of joy run free. <br />
<br />
Walking into the lobby of the Hospital with a spring in her step was Lady Cruciata, she knew she was supposed to be reaffirming her cover however she had to be at the hospital to support her future wife. Besides Miasma would be at her emotional weakest right now, she would be easier to sway to the right path and within a few days she would be more then happy to get married to her and that human plaything she had back home.<br />
<br />
The signs were good as she walked into the lobby to see it full of guards and Maisma standing in the middle of the room with tears running down her face as she looked upwards. <br />
<br />
“Maybe the human died quicker then I thought she would…all the better.” thought Lady Cruciata as she approached the guard. <br />
<br />
“I am Lady Cruciata and I have come to speak with close friend Princess Maisma in her time of need.” Said Cruciata with her own “fake” tears in her bug like eyes. The guards stayed close to her but brought her toward Maisma who was now flanked by her mother, Lilith and Baal who was acting more like a personal bodyguard then the Highest ranking General in the Armies of Hell.<br />
<br />
“Princess Maisma, I am so sorry to here about Rachel.” Stated Cruciata “I greave with you and I hope she finds peace.”<br />
<br />
Maisma turned and looked at her with tears still flowing down her face. <br />
<br />
“I just want you to know, that even in this tragedy I will always be there for you.” stated Cruciata as she took Maisma’s hand. “I know your father wants you to marry and with Rachel gone, we have been friends forever we can be more than that, just like…”<br />
<br />
Slap<br />
<br />
Cruciata didn’t know what hit her as she was sent falling to her side by the blow from Maisma who was glaring at her.<br />
<br />
“You make me sick.” Spat Maisma “I would never marry the likes of you, we where never friends, I was only nice to you because it was what my father wanted.”<br />
<br />
“I am sorry if I came off…” started Cruciata trying to recover from this sudden outburst. “I should have…”<br />
<br />
A second slap this one on the other cheek, however Cruciata didn’t go falling to the ground but it was a near thing.<br />
<br />
“And for your information, Rachel is very much alive.” Stated Maisma with hate in her voice for Cruciata.<br />
<br />
“She was stabbed with a holy weapon in the gut, she may still be a live but you can’t expect her to live for long…” started Cruciata before she noticed a figure leaning in the doorway behind Maisma.<br />
<br />
“No…that is impossible you were stabbed in the gut and cut open like a fish.” Stuttered Cruciata as that damn human Rachel was standing in the doorway with her midriff wrapped but still very much alive.<br />
<br />
“I am far from dead.” Laughed Rachel weakly as Maisy turned and ran toward her giving her a mighty kiss and almost knocking her to the ground. “But I am still weak, take it easy Maisy.”<br />
<br />
“No…this isn’t right.” Cursed Cruciata as she turned to leave only to find her way blocked by a the spear like point that Baal kept on the top of his war hammer. <br />
<br />
“What is the meaning of this!” yelled Cruciata as all eyes turned to the General of Hell’s armies.<br />
<br />
“Tell me something Lady Cruciata…how could you have possibly known about Rachel’s wounds.” Stated Baal <br />
<br />
“I was wondering the same thing.” stated Lilith her voice as cold as ice as she eyed the daughter of her husband’s best friend. “You came her, asking my daughter to marry you and you knew that Rachel had been stabbed in the gun with a holy weapon. All the guards were ordered to keep their mouth shut and are still here, same with the doctors. So how did you know where on Rachel’s body she had been stabbed? That is something I would very much like to know.”<br />
<br />
Cruciata&#39;s bug eyes where wide and she looked around like a deer in head lights as more of the guards turned toward her, hands on their weapons but not out.<br />
<br />
“As would I.” confirmed Lucifer his voice full of venom, his own hand on his sword hilt. “So tell us Lady Cruciata, tell us now.”</p>
