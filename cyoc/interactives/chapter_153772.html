<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael got up to leave Sofya’s front steps as Fido followed him. Seeing Michael moping around made Freddy upset. He didn’t know what Sofya had told Michael, but based on what Freddy had a chance to hear, he knew it was full of lies. Freddy hoped to tell his side of the story soon. He knew he made some mistakes, but he didn’t mean to hurt Michael. <br />
<br />
As the boy and dog passed by Michael’s house, they stopped for a moment. <br />
<br />
“Maybe…” Michael said aloud, before he reconsidered. “Never mind. My parents are home. I can’t bring him in there.”<br />
<br />
The two of them kept going until they reached Freddy’s house. Unfortunately, the car was in the driveway which meant that Freddy’s parents…and likely his brother…were home. Michael wanted to bring Fido in discreetly, but hesitated with going in the backyard in case Ellie was out there. <br />
<br />
“Maybe he can fuck Ellie back into being human” Michael thought to himself, but considering how upset he already was with what he saw this morning/afternoon, he didn’t want any more triggers to his fragile mental state. <br />
<br />
Quietly, Michael checked to see if Freddy’s front door was open, which surprisingly it was. Slowly, Michael saw himself in and Fido delicately came in behind him. Michael took care to quietly close the door before  making his way inside. Before they could make their way to the stairs, they heard a voice call out to them. <br />
<br />
“Who’s there?” Josh asked from the other room.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
“Let’s go” Michael quietly muttered to Fido. <br />
<br />
The two of them ran as fast as they could up the stairs as they heard Josh’s footsteps coming up behind them. Although they tried to quickly get into Freddy’s room, Josh made it to the staircase to see Fido’s tail wagging as it entered Freddy&#39;s room before Michael slammed it shut behind them. <br />
<br />
“Fido!” Josh yelled out and he rain up the stairs. “Fido! You came back, boy! Fido!”<br />
<br />
Josh got to the now locked door as he began to bang on it while yelling out to Fido.<br />
<br />
“Oh no” Michael muttered quietly as he took off his knapsack and settled into the room. “We have to get you changed back as soon as possible.”<br />
<br />
Fido’s sensitive ears felt like they were ringing as Josh’s yelling was driving him crazy. Although his instinct would be to bark to get Josh to shut up, Freddy knew that it would only make him more determined to come in here and accost him. He had to change back and fast. <br />
<br />
In fear, Fido looked down to find that his sheath remained normal with no sign of his red penis anywhere. He gave it a few licks before finding that he just couldn’t get it up. It was the dog’s version of erectile dysfunction. <br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael quietly whispered to him as he tried to get his attention. <br />
<br />
Josh’s loud banging and yelling caught the attention of his mother who was trying to calm him down on the other end of the door. <br />
<br />
“I’m sure you were just seeing things, honey” the muffled voice of Freddy’s mother said. <br />
<br />
“No mom!” Josh yelled back. “I swear I saw a tail! Fido’s tail! He’s in there and Michael is hiding him from me! Fido! Fido! Come out Fido!”<br />
<br />
Josh continued to bang on the door as Michael started to feel a sense of nervousness. With no sign of Fido’s red dick, Michael began looking around for a place to hide him before Freddy came up with an idea. Fido made his way over to the shut window and motioned to Michael. Curiously, Michael went over to look at the scene outside. Pacing around the neighbor’s yard was Ellie, still in heat. <br />
<br />
“You want to fuck her?” Michael asked nervously, not sure if he could handle seeing his boyfriend fuck someone else, even if they were dogs. <br />
<br />
Fido shook his head no and proceeded to make an up and down motion at the window. Michael was confused as Fido did this a couple of times before two and two got put together. <br />
<br />
“Oh” Michael said aloud. “You want me to open the window?”<br />
<br />
Fido nodded his head as Michael opened it wide. Although Michael didn’t notice anything different, Fido immediately began to feel a stirring in his loins. He could smell Ellie’s sweet pheromones on his sensitive nose, and soon, his big red dick made an appearance once again.<br />
<br />
“Oh” Michael said as he looked to Freddy’s red dick. “You wanted me to open it so you could smell Ellie’s heat.”<br />
<br />
Fido nodded as he made his way over to the bed and hopped on top of it. Fido nudged his head to Michael, commanding him to come over. Michael took the rolling chair and and made his way over to him. Fido began licking Michael’s face. The combination of his attraction to Michael and the smell of Ellie in the air really made him horny. If he could, he would have loved to take off Michael’s clothes and insert his penis right into his asshole. He knew, though, that his dick was too big and his knot could damage him. Although his instinct was to make wild, passionate love right there and then, he gathered his strength to resist these temptations. <br />
<br />
Instead, Fido took his paw and placed in on Michael hand. Fido then motioned Michael to his throbbing dick. <br />
<br />
“You want me to jack you off?” Michael asked quietly. <br />
<br />
Fido nodded. Michael found a bottle of lube in Freddy’s drawer and squirted some into his hand. <br />
<br />
“Alright boy, here goes nothing.”<br />
<br />
Nervously, Michael took his hand and placed it on Fido’s dick. He could feel it throbbing as Fido began panting rapidly. Fido really enjoyed this. He was very turned on. Michael slowly began to move his hand up and down, feeling Fido’s dog dick for the first time. It felt slimier and firmer than Freddy’s normal dick, but otherwise, it wasn’t so bad. As Michael stroked, Fido began licking at Michael’s face, making him uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
While this was going on, the banging and yelling continued on the other side of the door. Soon, Freddy’s father came up the stairs to ask what the commotion was all about. <br />
<br />
“Fido is in there!” Josh yelled. <br />
<br />
“Josh is just seeing things” his mother replied. <br />
<br />
“Well, let’s go in and take a look” his father added. <br />
<br />
“I don’t think that’s such a good idea, dear. Freddy needs his rest.”<br />
<br />
“It’ll just be a minute.”<br />
<br />
“Honey.”<br />
<br />
“No, dear. It’s my house and Freddy should open it now.”<br />
<br />
“Crap!” Freddy thought to himself. <br />
<br />
“This isn’t working” Michael said to Fido under his breath. <br />
<br />
Freddy knew what might get him over the edge, but he didn’t know if Michael would do it. Knowing that time was running out, he nudged his snout to dick and then to Michael’s face. After doing this several times, Michael got what Freddy was trying to communicate. <br />
<br />
“You don’t expect me to suck that thing, do you?” Michael hissed sharply under his breath. <br />
<br />
Fido nodded. It was the only way at this point. Either Michael gave him head or Freddy’s parents would find Fido in his room. Michael hesitated. He was still very angry at Freddy and wasn’t in the mood to pleasure him in any way. On the other hand, if he didn’t do it, it was going to be more difficult to get Freddy back to normal. He couldn’t wait many hours, or even days, to hear Freddy’s side of the story to today’s events. He needed to know while the memories were still fresh.<br />
<br />
Begrudgingly, Michael moved his mouth and placed it around Fido’s dick. Upon entrance, Michael could feel it throb as Fido began to thrust in and out of his mouth. Fido was in heaven. He already felt good with Michael’s hand on his dick, and now, he felt an explosion of color in his eyes. He wanted to mate with Michael. Even if it was only his mouth, Fido was determined to release his seed in him. To own him. To possess him.<br />
<br />
Fido’s thrusting got more rapid as he put his front paws on Michael’s back and began to jackhammer into him. Michael soon felt Fido’s dick expand in his mouth as the knot began to emerge. <br />
<br />
“Oh god” Michael thought to himself. “This is like trying to swallow a tennis ball. I don’t think I can keep it in here any longer.”<br />
<br />
Michael felt an initial sense of relief as Fido’s thrusting stopped. However, it was replaced with repulsion as spurts and spurts of dog semen flooded into his mouth. <br />
<br />
“Ack!” Michael shrieked aloud as his pulled Fido’s dick out of his mouth, causing him to whimper at the scraping of his dick with Michael’s teeth. Soon, more dog semen coated Michael’s face as Fido ended his orgasm. Fido began panting happily as he saw his conquest drenched in his DNA. Michael, grabbing one of Freddy’s tee shirts, wiped his face down, spitting excess cum onto the floor. <br />
<br />
As this was going on, Freddy’s parents and brother had briefly left before they returned. Freddy’s father got a screwdriver and began undoing the hinges on the door.<br />
<br />
“Honey, you shouldn’t be doing this” Freddy’s mother called to her husband in a muffled voice. <br />
<br />
“It’s my house!” Freddy’s father yelled back to her. “And there can be no secrets hidden from me!” <br />
<br />
“Fido is in there!” Josh yelled. <br />
<br />
Fear washed over Michael as he turned to Fido, fearful that his blowjob hadn’t done the trick.<br />
<br />
“I hope this works” Michael thought to himself as he continued to wipe his sticky face. <br />
<br />
As if his prayers were answered, Fido began to recede back into Freddy. His fur drew back into his skin, his four legged stance shifted into that of a boy on his hands and knees and his doggy face twisted and turned into Freddy’s, showing a sense of relief on his face. Freddy maneuvered himself to sit on his bed with his legs folded into him, feeling his face with a smile. <br />
<br />
Freddy’s relief was short lived as the last bolt that held the door on the frame came off. <br />
<br />
“Quick Freddy!” Michael called to him. “Get under the covers now!”<br />
<br />
Noticing his naked state, Freddy gasped as he got under the covers and pulled them tightly over him. Just as he did so, the door fell off the hinges and there stood in the hallway Freddy’s parents and his brother. <br />
<br />
“Fido!” Josh yelled as he began to scour Freddy’s room. “Fido! Where did you go?”<br />
<br />
“I already told you” his mother replied as she went to grab him. “He’s not here. Let’s go. Leave your brother alone. He’s not feeling well.”<br />
<br />
“But I saw him go in here! I saw Fido! Fido! Fido, where are you?!”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s mother grabbed Josh as she took him out of the room kicking and screaming. Freddy’s father stood awkwardly as Freddy and Michael looked at him nervously. <br />
<br />
“Was Fido here?” Freddy’s father asked. <br />
<br />
The two boys nodded silently. <br />
<br />
“Well” his father continued “he’s not here now, so that’s all that matters.”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s father felt something move under his foot as he looked at the fallen door frame on the floor below. <br />
<br />
“I’ll fix that tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Can you fix it now, please?” Freddy asked his father.<br />
<br />
“Later” his father replied.<br />
<br />
Freddy’s father turned to leave his room, picking up the fallen door and moving it out the way. When the hallway was clear, Michael turned to Freddy and began to talk.</p>
