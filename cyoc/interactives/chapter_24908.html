<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Doc and Carl smile as they watch their newly turned bear friend walk out of the room, with such lust in his eyes and walk for his prize, it makes the two very horny and ready to fuck again.<br />
<br />
     The two look at each other, amazed by the others look and feel, they lock muzzles in a warm, sensual and very sexual kiss. Thier tongues swimming around in the other's muzzle. When Carl unlocks, a huge gaze over took his eys and the Doc knew he was up to something!<br />
<br />
     &quot;What are you thinking my sexy bear man?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Oh nothing really. I had this idea about making it much easier to change the whole school.&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Oh really... do tell!&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well I was thinking... your intern Justin had a really good idea about turning the sexiest man to him on campus, to possibly take on the whole football team...&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Yea... so what exactly were you considering and who were you thinking about changing?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well you tell me... who here has the most control over the school, who gets admitted and what-not?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well, that would be the Dean of Admissions, who is also the headmaster of the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Just after he said that aloud, his eyes widened just as much as Carl's had when he first had the idea. Carl nodded and they walked out together with their meaty, bear arms around each other. AS they were walking down the hall, headed toward the skyway to the office of admissions, they could see the Dean was already on his way toward the clinic. As they continued walking towards him, they noticed his nostrils flare and he began sniffing the air, in almost a primal way. The two bears saw this and they knew that this was going to be a piece of cake for taking over the school.<br />
<br />
     As they neared the Dean, he began looking around furiously, searching for someone, with eyes full of lust, wanting nothing more than to mate with who ever came across his way. When they came in very close promiity of each other, the dean saw the two bears and ran towards them, stripping all his clothes, revealing his meaty, lumberjack body accompanied by a sexy amout of human fur. The two vears stopped and beagan jacking their cocks, priming themselves for a quick climax, just to turn him and move on to the next target. As the Dean reached Carl, he dropped on his knees and let Carl feed his monstrous bear cock in his mouth and down his throat. At first he gaged and chocked on the cock, but he quickly got used to the size and was deepthroating him in no time. Carl rolled his eyes tot he back of his head and roared as he erupted down the hungry throat. As soon as the dean sucked out the last dreg of cum, he pulled off and directed his attention at the still jacking doc. The dean playfully licked at the tapered head and the two bears could already see the changes happening in the Dean. The Doc didn't want to spoil the fun by telling the Dean about his growth and changes, he really wanted his cock to cream the Dean whereever and however he wanted. The Dean proceeded to suck on the Doc's bear cock and got him close to cuming.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Where do you want me to cum?&quot; The Doc growled.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Get it all over me! I want to look and feel as the two of you must. I've always secretly wanted to be a bear-morph or as we know them, an ursanthrope/werebear.&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well now you will get your chance!&quot;<br />
<br />
     The Dean just knelt there, still changing from the cum he swallowed a few, short minutes ago, awaiting the up and cumming climax. He rubbed himself, not really noticing the changes and acted as if his body had always been that muscular and furry with his very erect and protuding nipples. The Dean howled and sprayed his cum all over the Dean, coating every inch of his bearish form, ensuring that he would be like the two of them. The two gathered closer to the Dean and rubbed the cum through his fur and into his skin. The Dean moaned as he felt a tingling sensation overwhelm his body. Once they noticed the cum was gone, and rubbed into his pores, they stepped back and waited, arms wrapped around each other. The Dean moaned more and more, with his voice slowly turning into a deep, bearish growl. His muscles started to spasm just a bit as he began his final change. Slowly, his body grew more and more into that of a large, brown mountain bear. As his changes ended and he could compose himself, he stood up on his hin legs and looked at the other two. Carl and the Doc looked down at the Dean's cock and noticed that it was huge and still human in shape, with a very nice and thick mushroom head.<br />
<br />
     &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Awesome, who are you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well I am known just as Doc, this here is my friend and mate Carl.&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well I just want to thank you both. I was very unhappy in my human form, even though I was a lumberjack, not many gay guys out there want guys like me, but now... I noticed when you guys were coming closer, there was an irresistable pheremone in the air that overwhelmed me and made me want who ever was near... so now I know that my problem before doesn't even exist!&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;That's great, now what do you feel like doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well... the first thing I want to do is to make every guy on campus just like this! Then I am thinking I should just go ahead and change this to an all male campus and not let any females in! By any chance, do you know what we've become and how it would affect females if we introduced our cum to their system?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;No, my tests never were applied to a female. In fact they weren't applied to anyone but myself until Carl here came along. I think it will be very interesting to find out though.&quot;</p>
