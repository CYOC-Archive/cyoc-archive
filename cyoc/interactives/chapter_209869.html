<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Although there was still plenty of information to gather on Kane, other matters needed to be attended to. The vampires that Sylvia and Tanya found wanted to return to the vampire nation and escorting them would be none other than Duke Tepes. &quot;I still don&#39;t know why you want me to come,&quot; Nat asked nervously. Duke gave the teen a reassuring smile before explaining his plan. &quot;Its because of what you are,&quot; he said softly. &quot;If any of your human friends went, they&#39;d immediate be fed upon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why not me and Connor,&quot; Spark asked. Duke raised an eyebrow before responding. &quot;How do you think the son of a demon hunter would be treated,&quot; he asked. &quot;Also Spark, would you really be able to keep your cool? Especially considering what happened to Jacob?&quot; Spark paused before sighing. It made sense honestly, if she saw the vampires that had attacked the Morelands she would attack first. This wasn&#39;t an attack, this, as Duke explained, was a diplomatic mission. They were going to return the vampires before trying to unearth any more information on Ezekiel Kane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay you got a point,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Spark now steadied herself, she had borrowed runes from home to open a portal into the vampire homeland. This mission though was secret, if any of their friends learned what they were doing it could prove to be problematic.<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t be long Spark,&quot; Duke stated. &quot;Just please keep this trip quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding of course I will,&quot; Spark exclaimed. &quot;Connor and Caleb would freak! Not to mention your girlfriend, hell Nat&#39;s mom would have a coronary if she found out she was journeying to the vampire homeland.&quot; Duke nodded, glancing at a very nervous looking Nat as Spark now opened a portal. &quot;Good luck you two,&quot; Spark sand softly as the pair of dhamphirs now stepped through.<br />
<br />
Nat blinked as her eyes began to focus. One moment she was stepping into a doorway of light. The next moment she found herself standing in a town square. Glancing around the young teen noticed that it appeared to be night, which struck her as odd since it had been early afternoon. As she looked up in the sky though, she gasped as she now saw a blood red moon shining down upon them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cmon,&quot; Duke stated. &quot;We need to find out where my brother is.&quot; Nat nodded, following Duke cautiously as the pair moved deeper into town.<br />
<br />
Already the vampires they had arrived with had run off. Nat noticed the two women make for a inn before vanishing inside. As the duo continued on, she noticed other vampires casting them a look of disdain. Men, women, children it did not matter, everyone who saw Duke immediately stopped what they were doing to scowl at him. Nat could feel a chill run down her spine as vampires bared their fangs. &quot;I don&#39;t think they like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They don&#39;t,&quot; Duke said flatly. &quot;My father was a monster but to vampires he was a beloved leader. To them I&#39;m simply seen as an enemy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why don&#39;t they attack us,&quot; Nat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they believe I killed him,&quot; he smirked. &quot;So to the vampires I&#39;m the monster now.&quot; Nat shuddered, inching a little closer to Duke. She hated thinking of herself as a monster but realized that vampires believing she was one was the only thing keeping her from being ripped apart. <br />
<br />
Duke now came to a stop, Nat&#39;s eyes going wide as she saw a hulking vampire now standing in their path. &quot;Hannibal,&quot; Duke stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have alot of nerve returning Duke,&quot; Hannibal said, his voice deep and menacing. &quot;Why have you come?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I offered two vampires safe passage here,&quot; Duke stated. &quot;And I needed to speak with my brother. I understand fortune has smiled upon him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what makes you think Wyatt wishes to see you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Duke could answer, Nat noticed a pair of vampires advance behind them. Glancing back she could see a young red haired girl and a man with straw colored hair. Both vampires appeared scarred from what Nat could tell. What she did see though was the samauri sword that was now positioned to take off both Duke and Nats heads. &quot;Um Duke?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its okay,&quot; Duke said softly. The dhamphir now narrowing his eyes as he glared at Hannibal. &quot;I haven&#39;t come to fight,&quot; he said. &quot;Simply to offer my congratulations and to ask a favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A favor,&quot; Hannibal scoffed. &quot;Why should Lord Wyatt offer you a favor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because my friends and I are the reason for his miraculous heirs.&quot; Hannibal paused at Dukes words, critically looking over the pair before speaking. &quot;Ann, Ken stay close to them,&quot; he stated. &quot;If they make any sudden moves, then dispose of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With pleasure,&quot; Ken replied, sheathing his blade as he pushed Duke and Nat forward. As they now walked, Nat tried to get a better look at their vampire escorts. The girl appeared no more than 8 years old yet her face was void of emotion, while the man appeared to be in his 30s with his eyes wrapped in bandages. &quot;Who are these guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Members of the Five,&quot; Duke stated. &quot;The one guarding you is Ann. Perhaps the deadliest and most brutal assassin the vampires have ever known.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But she&#39;s just a little girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Appearances can be deceiving,&quot; Duke stated. Nat simply nodded, gulping as she glanced back at Ann once more. Knowing who she was hadn&#39;t put her mind at ease. &quot;Okay and what about him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ken,&quot; Duke answered. &quot;Also of the Five. A master swordsman. Despite his lack of sight he is probably one of the greatest swordsmen in the world. Or so I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken now roughly pushed Duke forward, Nat gasping in fright as the vampire growled. &quot;I&#39;ll have my chance for vengeance someday against that accursed kitsune,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Now shut up and keep moving!&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke smirked, the dhamphirs remaining quiet as they entered an exquisite mansion. If Nat hadn&#39;t been so terrified she would have taken the time to admire the beauty of the home. Styled in a Victorian fashion, the mansion rested on a rather large estate. Standing three stories tall with steepled roofs, Nat wondered just how many rooms were contained within.<br />
<br />
As they entered the mansion, Nat gawked at the massive front foyer. A pair of stone staircase wound their way up to a second floor balcony that overlooked the massive oak doors. Illuminating the room was a chandelier that burned with an intense light that Nat felt was neither electrical nor natural.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now isn&#39;t this a pleasant surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat and Duke now glanced towards the voice, watching a a teenager around Dukes age now descended the marble staircase. The teenager was a vampire, that much Nat could see. Dressed regally in dark blue clothes, Nat could felt she was gazing at a Medieval lord as opposed to a vampiric teenager.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello brother,&quot; Duke grumbled, the dhamphir staring directly into Wyatt&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duke,&quot; Wyatt responded, the vampire lords voice emotionless as the pair locked eyes. &quot;I understand you helped return some of my subjects to our lands. How generous of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke simply nodded, her face void of expression before he spoke. &quot;And I hear that you&#39;ve become a father,&quot; he said. &quot;I suppose congratulations are in order.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt smirked, rubbing his chin as he studied Duke carefully. &quot;Is that why you&#39;ve come here,&quot; he asked. Duke shook his head no. &quot;I&#39;m in need of a favor,&quot; he replied. &quot;Or at least she is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why should I do you any favors,&quot; Wyatt asked. &quot;Haven&#39;t I done you enough of a service by withdrawing our forces? That was our deal brother or had you forgotten.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I haven&#39;t forgotten,&quot; Duke smiled. &quot;Believe me I relish the memory of our fight everyday.&quot; Wyatt snarled, Nat for a moment thinking he would strike. Taking a breath, Wyatt now glanced at Nat, the teen fidgeting nervously under his gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shes a dhamphir,&quot; Wyatt stated in awe. <br />
<br />
&quot;She is,&quot; Duke replied. &quot;And, considering it was Sasha that helped you father several heirs I think that a favor is the least that you owe someone related to the vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are her parents,&quot; Wyatt asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Her parentage is of no concern,&quot; Duke said sternly. Wyatt frowned, looking to start arguing with Duke before Nat spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Natalia MacGregor Lord Wyatt,&quot; she stammered. &quot;My mother, Marisa. She&#39;s the vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know a Marisa MacGregor,&quot; Wyatt said softly. The vampire lord now rubbed his chin in contemplation before speaking carefully. &quot;Normally I would pry deeper into your lineage Natalia,&quot; he said. &quot;However, my brother here has a point. I do owe him. So for the sake of my three sons and two daughters I shall honor your request.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Nat stammered. Taking a breath she now looked at Wyatt before asking. &quot;Do you know anything about Ezekiel Kane?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ezekiel Kane?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat, Duke, and Wyatt now turned towards the voice. Slowly from the shadows thw trio noticed a thin vampire emerge, Nat paling slightly at the nasty scar that bisected his face. &quot;You&#39;ve heard of him Donovan,&quot; Wyatt asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed I have,&quot; Donovan said softly. &quot;He was a hunter a very brutal one. He murdered your father Miro&#39;s first wife and child decades ago but I thought him dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hes alive,&quot; Nat stated. &quot;Hes already attacked a pair of wizards and who knows how many others. We need any information you can give us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat now watched as Donovan approached Wyatt, whispering something into his ear. The vampire lord nodding before beckoning Duke over. As Nat watched the dhamphir and vampire talk, she could see an odd look cross his face before he whispered a reply to Wyatt. The brothers nodding before Wyatt once more turned to Nat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regrettably our forces are still recovering from our foray last year,&quot; Wyatt stated. &quot;We still are trying to find a a fifth member of the Five. However, Donovan does have information on this rogue hunter. We will offer this information to you and in return Duke will offer us something when the time is right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat curiously looked to Duke who now nodded. She wasn&#39;t quite sure what she was getting herself into but hoped that whatever the vampires gave her would help to stop Kane.</p>
