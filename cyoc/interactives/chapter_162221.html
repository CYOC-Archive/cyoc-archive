<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
<br />
I woke up with a screeching headache. My body ached immensely. Looking down, I noticed I was completely naked under the bedsheet. Thankfully, I breathed a sigh of relief to see my regular-sized, hairless body once again. A small, dried patch of my cum stuck to the mattress. Despite the cold, morning air seeping through the window, my body was still incredibly warm. Was yesterday all just a dream? That Hope was quashed when I saw Joe quickly pack his suitcase from the other side of the room.<br />
<br />
He wore a pair of grey sweatpants, and the same vest he wore yesterday. My cock came alive again when he crouched over the suitcase, his ass pushing forcefully through the fabric. It looked so plump in those trousers, and his thighs looked even meatier than before. I noticed his vest looked a few sizes smaller on him. His thick traps stood on his wide shoulders, straining his vest. He had grown a lot since breakfast. He looked like a bodybuilder! From where I sat, I could only see his incredibly ripped back, and irresistibly rounded asscheeks. I don’t think he knew I was awake.<br />
<br />
“I know you’re awake.”<br />
<br />
I was wrong. His voice was rougher, manlier. It had an aggressive tone. A weirdly intense silence fell on the two of us. I tried to break it, unaware of the stern expression on Joe’s face.. <br />
<br />
“What time is it?”<br />
“Where were you yesterday?”<br />
“Huh?”<br />
“At breakfast, I kinda expected you to follow me.”<br />
“Oh, well Dan said he would look after you and-“<br />
“You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?”<br />
“Enjoying what?”<br />
“Oh come on now. Stop playing dumb. You’re loving the fact that I’m turning into one of those freaks.”<br />
“Well it doesn’t seem that bad.”<br />
“That bad?! Look at me!”<br />
<br />
He stood to face me. I was caught off guard by his 6’8” height which towered over everything in the room. As he rose, his sweatpants moved up his thick calves, until it was practically skintight around his strong legs. His arms were huge, as veiny biceps bulged out of them. The tight fabric of Joe’s vest tried to spread over his pecs, only to have most of them spill out from the side. I could see a new row of abs that wasn’t there before, his 8-pack inflating as he inhaled deeply. I tried to avoid looking, but couldn’t help but glance at the prominent tent in his sweatpants. His cock must’ve been over a foot-long! A large wet patch at the tip had formed, with Joe’s precum seeping through the fabric. He zealously flexed his arms as he pushed his pecs together. As he did so he gazed upon his perfect ass in the mirror.  I could see his thick cheeks visibly move up and down in his sweatpants as he tensed them. I was so in awe of his body, I spent barely any time looking at his face. Whilst his large, bright eyes were still the same, the bone structure of his face had changed drastically. He looked more manly, with a sharp jawline, and a thick neck. His cheeks and jaw had darkened, as a thin layer of facial hair had sprouted, growing down over his Adam’s apple. He admired his growing body. However, his face was still filled with anger and worry. I could see his member throb, causing the wet patch of his cum to grow.<br />
<br />
“I’m…..I look like my brothers. Like my fathers. None of my clothes fit me anymore, and I’ve practically given up on showering. I just had one, and I stink…”<br />
<br />
He was right. I could faintly smell the boy’s potent musk as it slowly traveled to my side of the room, as my cock hardened. He continued as he flexed his back, watching worriedly as his muscles bulged considerably through his vest.<br />
<br />
“You like this?”<br />
“Yeah. I do. Please, fuck me.”<br />
“God, you have no idea how much I wanna do that right now-NO!”<br />
<br />
I flinched as he quickly raised his hand into the air, smacking himself in the head. He hit himself several times before calming down.<br />
<br />
“I’m not gay! I’ve got a girlfriend for Christ’s sake! But, am I bi then? I don’t know what I am anymore. Something fucked up is happening to me Jamie, and you don’t even seem to care. OHHH-“<br />
<br />
As the fabric of his sweatpants rubbed against his cock, he moaned with his deep voice as a thick shot of cum flew from his manhood. It shot straight through his mostly wet trousers, landing on the floor beside the bed.  He continued to moan as his large hands hovered over his crotch, as if he was resisting the urge to jerk off. My heart sank as I saw his eyes beginning to water with his tears.<br />
<br />
“Ohhh God, I can feel my balls, they’re so full. One touch and I think I’ll explode. Fuck! I need to fight it. I gotta get out of here. I’m leaving Jamie. Right now. With or without you.”<br />
“But-“<br />
“Are you coming with me or not?”<br />
<br />
I was torn from his ultimatum. Thinking about staying, surrounded by those sexy giants triggered a wave of hormones into my brain. However, as he looked at me, silently wishing for me to leave with him, I realised that helping my best friend was way important. Although, part of me wanted to live here forever. I could feel it. The beast within me. It wanted me to stay. Before I could think it through, Joe took my silence as my answer, as he grabbed his suitcase and strode towards the door.<br />
<br />
“Fine, have it your way.”<br />
“Wait!”<br />
<br />
I quickly rose from the bed, my loud voice stopping Joe in his tracks. He had his large hand on the doorknob, and as he looked back at me, his eyes widened. The boy’s eyes eagerly darted across my body, fixating on my cock, which was pointing directly at him. I was too busy fighting the urge to make out with him, I barely noticed another thick shot of precum launching across the room, splattering the window. There we both stood, incredibly horny. However, I was determined not to give into my primal urges.<br />
<br />
“You’re right. Fuck, I’m sorry Joe. I do care. Something’s happening to me too, and I don’t know what it is. I’m leaving with you. We’ll feel better once we get some distance from this place, and when we get home, we can sort out this mess.”<br />
“Thanks man.”<br />
“No problem. Wanna hug?”<br />
“Fuck off!”<br />
<br />
We both laughed as I grabbed my things, breaking the sexual tension. After everything, it was nice to know we were still friends. I went to pack my things, with Joe waiting impatiently by the door. Most of my stuff was already in the suitcase. Grabbing my striped pyjamas from the floor, just next to one of Joe’s large puddles of cum, I briskly put them on. Suddenly, I heard Joe gasp in amazement, as I froze. I then felt a hand press into my shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Dude, what the hell?! Why do you have Father’s tattoo!”<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
Looking in the mirror, I could see it spread across my back. It looked exactly like Aku’s. When did I get Aku’s tattoo? Joe dropped his suitcase, moving his tight vest to show his tattoo in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Only our Fathers have that one, the rest of us have….wait. Mine’s changed!”<br />
<br />
Looking at his muscular shoulder, I saw his tattoo now resemble a man with a lion’s mane, exactly like mine and Aku’s. He began to panic, as his breathing quickened and grew shallow. Despite his fear, his cock was still ceaselessly leaking precum. He shuddered slightly as he felt his seed drip slowly down his thigh. My cock throbbed when his manly scent filled my nose entirely. I tried to keep calm, suppressing my horny desires. I felt my body begin to heat up. <br />
<br />
“Calm down. We’ll figure this out later. Right now, let’s just get out of here.”<br />
“How are we gonna do that?”<br />
“We’ll sneak out through the front doors, to the car. They’ll be having their breakfast in the dining room, so we need to keep quiet when walking past the doors.”<br />
“Got it. Let’s go.”<br />
<br />
With Joe picking up our suitcases, his strong arms bulging out, we crept out of the room. I could tell Joe’s eyes were planted firmly on my butt, since I could hear his cock audibly strain his sweatpants. A large tray of food was placed on the small table by our door in the corridor. A note was attached to it.<br />
<br />
“Hey boys,<br />
Thought you would prefer breakfast in bed today!<br />
Dan x”<br />
<br />
Joe grabbed a few of the muffins into he tray as we walked past, stuffing them into his mouth. I cautiously looked through the open doors to each room in the corridor. The inside of each one was the same; flooded with cum, and the beds mostly destroyed. It was remarkable how the boys were so disciplined in keeping the corridor clean. There wasn’t a single speck of dirt in the hallway. Turning around, I almost laughed as I saw a wide trail of cum leading from our room to where Joe stood. I could tell he was embarrassed by his hyperactive libido, so instead of joking about it, I continued to lead us down the hallway.<br />
<br />
The mansion felt eerily quiet, and as we slowly crept down the staircase in the entrance hall, we began to tremble with fear. There were so many doors and passages that lead to and from the entrance hall. Joe crossed his fingers, hoping that no one would suddenly enter through one of those doors. As we made our way across the hall, I looked up at the painting of the warrior, his flaccid member swinging freely under his loincloth. When we walked past the dining room, we could hear the loud, muffled grunts and moans coming from the other side of the closed doors. The boys were still having their breakfast. The sounds of their session only turned me and Joe on even more. My balls ached, as they were almost overflowing with my seed. Still, with gritted teeth I refused to give in. I felt my body heat up even more as my forehead glistened with sweat.<br />
<br />
Joe was panting heavily, as his cock throbbed in his sweatpants.I could see his continuous supply of precum increase, gushing from his cock. I couldn’t believe how much he was cuming. It was as if his balls were producing semen faster then he could release it. Thankfully, we were able to stay quiet, and when we finally reached the large, front doors, I felt like I could breathe again. Smiling, I gently placed my hand on the door handle. As I pushed it open, the door suddenly let out a deafening creak, which echoed throughout the house. <br />
<br />
Joe and I looked at each other. We could hear the sounds from the dining room quickly subside. We froze in fear when the doors slowly opened, as Jim peeked into the hall. Noticing us by the front doors, carrying our luggage, he quickly worked out what we were doing. He lunged towards, the massive boner between his thighs swinging violently like a wrecking ball. Jim turned his head slightly, as his booming voice traveled behind him.<br />
<br />
“They’re leaving! Everyone, quick! Get out here!”<br />
<br />
Joe frantically pushed the front doors open, running towards his car by the front lawn. I couldn’t move. As I watched this naked giant charge towards me, I felt my heart rate quicken immensely. I was too afraid and too horny to run. I could hear Joe scream my name behind me, but it was too late. Jim grabbed my torso, pushing my body into his erect cock. I felt his meaty shaft throb as he leaned in, kissing me. It was like I was hypnotised by his muscular frame. I didn’t resist. Instead, I moved my hands down to caress his cock, feeling his cum warm my fingers. He smiled, as he slowly put his thick fingers into my pyjamas, grabbing my ass and spreading my cheeks apart. I moaned as I felt his manhood grind against my stomach. I didn’t care anymore. All I wanted was his cock..<br />
<br />
“I said I’d tear you apart.”<br />
“Do it. I want it-OH!”<br />
<br />
I felt Joe’s beefy hands grab on of my arms, trying incredibly hard to pull me away from his brother. Jim grabbed the other, as I became the rope of an intense tug-of-war between the two. I began to panic as I saw a tsunami of naked, horny giants flood out from the dining room doors, their naked bodies sliding on the tiled floor, which was covered in a thick layer of Joe’s juices. I saw Pat run out with Steve wrapped around his waist, fucking him wildly as he charged towards me and Joe. I could see the uncontrollable lust in their eyes. It was both terrifying and incredibly arousing.<br />
<br />
With one forceful yank, Joe pulled me from Jim’s grasp, sending us both tumbling through the front doors, and onto the lawn. I landed on him, using the boy’s wide, powerful chest to break my fall. He didn’t seem to be affected, as almost instantly he picked me up, and sprinted to the car. The brothers chased us, their massive boners smacking their abs with every step. Long spurts of cum flew from them, flying everywhere. There were so many of them, and they all wanted to fuck me. Although I wanted to join them, I blocked out those erotic images from my mind, suppressing my raging hormones yet again. Suddenly, I felt a huge pain in my chest. I pressed on it with my hands as Joe opened the doors to the car, throwing me inside. When he sat on the driver’s seat, we both slammed our doors shut, and pushed down on the locks. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before we were completely surrounded by these 8ft-tall hunks, trying to get into the car. A couple of them climbed onto the roof. I couldn’t tell what they were doing, but I saw huge shots of their seed fly onto the rest of the giants. Jim laid sensually along the hood of the car, enticing us out as another boy eagerly sucked him off. The windows and windshield became soaked in their collective loads. Even in the car, we could smell the boys’ erotically-charged, sweaty bodies. I could see Joe’s cock looked harder than ever, as it pushed his sweatpants to the brink of tearing open. The pain in my chest refused to subside. Joe could hear my groans among the pleasurable grunts and growls of the group outside, as he turned to see me hunched over.<br />
<br />
“Shit! Are you OK?”<br />
“I’m fine. Just drive!”<br />
<br />
Joe frantically reached into his pockets for his keys. Doing so, he accidentally brushed against one of his balls. A paralysing orgasm rippled throughout his body, as he let out a low moan. Another huge shot of his cum blasted from his cock, hitting the ceiling of the car. Still, he persisted, reaching into his other pocket, this time more carefully. I then saw his face turn pale, as he stared at the front doors.<br />
<br />
“Oh no…I left my keys in my shorts. And they’re in my suitcase. <br />
“What?!”<br />
“We’re fucked!”<br />
“Literally!”<br />
<br />
Just then, in the corner of my eye, I could see the window of the dining room start to spin. The rumbling sounds of the mechanisms that shifted the window turned the boys silent, as they watched with eager eyes. Joe was too busy ogling his brothers, as more of his cum shot from his cock like a waterspout. He writhed about in his chair, desperately clinging onto the last remnants of his heterosexuality. My eyes were fixed on the two figures that had stepped out of the now-open window. It was hard to see through the cum-covered windshield. I could barely make out Dan, who slowly limped towards us, moaning intensely. I then noticed his ass was impaled by Aku’s throbbing monster. The boys nearly exploded with cum. While they would frequently have sex with Aku and Dan separately, they had never, but always wanted to, see their Fathers fuck. Now that they’re ultimate fantasy had come true, most of the boys began to empty their huge balls on the floor as their parents walked past them. Aku then lifted Dan into the air, sliding more of his shaft deep into his husband, who was overwhelmed with continuous waves of pleasure. Aku was back to normal, however, he was still a giant. The two men stood in front of the car, as the boys gathered behind them, tempted to reach out and grab Aku’s ass which bathed in his sweat. I could hear the man laugh, his voice was so powerful it shook the car slightly. We both watched on as he spoke to us.<br />
<br />
“Why must you two leave so soon? We have yet to celebrate Joe’s birthday.”<br />
“We don’t care! Just let us go-ARGHH!”<br />
<br />
The pain in my chest intensified. It felt like my heart was pumping ridiculously fast. I could feel something in my stomach. Aku laughed again.<br />
<br />
“Jamie, my son. You must embrace the Spirit of the Lion. Suppressing it will only bring you pain.”<br />
“Spirit of the Lion?”<br />
“It’s a long story.”<br />
“Set it free my child! Feel the Spirit change you.”<br />
<br />
I could barely speak through the pain. I couldn’t see a way out, and my last glimmer of hope was doused when I turned to see Joe, who had placed his hand on my leg, smiling softly.<br />
<br />
“Jamie. I think…I think I love you.”<br />
“What? Ahhhhh-no, you have to fight it Joe!”<br />
“Why bother? I want you.”<br />
“But you’re not-MMMM!”<br />
<br />
I felt Joe slam his lips onto mine before I could even try to snap him out of it. As our tongues intertwined, I felt the pain in my chest go away. Kissing Joe was all I ever wanted, and now, I felt my body become totally relaxed, as he moved his hand up my thigh. That was when, without any warning, I felt my cock swell in my pyjamas. It doubled in length, as my balls quickly grew to match it. When Joe wrapped his fingers around my length, he was surprised by its size, breaking away from the kiss to stare at it in amazement.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit! I didn’t know it was so big!”<br />
“Oh God, I can feel it coming. OHHHH!”<br />
<br />
I groaned, hearing my voice become deeper. Then, before our very eyes, my body elongated, reaching Joe’s height in seconds. As my muscles expanded considerably, I felt my pyjamas tighten around my frame, my shirt now riding above my stomach. Joe watched lustfully as my pecs pushed outwards, as well as a a pack of abs rise on my stomach like bread in an oven. I expected my clothes to tear off. Instead, they clung onto my large body. As a strong wave of testosterone flooded my veins, Joe kissed me again, running his hands up my shirt, and through my chest hair as it began to sprout. Joe’s mouth moved to my neck, feeling it widen under his tongue. I could feel the beast within in me take over. I didn’t want to leave. Neither did Joe, who was eagerly licking the sweat off my fully-grown pecs. When I finished growing, Aku’s voice boomed from outside the car.<br />
<br />
“As is tradition, you two will see you full potential at midnight. See this as a trial run for the rest of your lives. Now, who wishes to join us?”<br />
<br />
As he erotically shook his ass to his boys, the pack pounced on him, forming a giant orgy just a few feet from the car. Jim excitedly rammed his face between his father’s cheeks. The man moaned loudly as he felt Jim’s tongue penetrate his asshole. Pat and Steve took turns making out with Dan, who had almost passed out from the pleasure. Seeing, and hearing, the display before us sent our sex drives wild. Joe and I could feel our balls overflow with cum, as the pressure inside them continued to mount. I felt my primal urges kick in. I needed to cum, now. I leapt onto Joe, tearing his sweatpants in half. He grunted as I firmly gripped his cock with both hands, and began pumping it furiously. Joe did the same, pulling my throbbing member from the shredded remnants of my pyjamas. He was practically screaming, finally being able to indulge in his repressed needs.<br />
<br />
“Ohhhh fuck! I think I’m close.”<br />
“I love you too Joe.”<br />
“What?”<br />
“I LOVE YOU TOO!”<br />
“OHHHH-“<br />
<br />
Joe’s loud moans quickly turned into an ear-piercing roar, which almost shattered the windows. His grip around my cock tightened, as the seemingly endless amount of cum that was trapped in his balls was finally released. He shot his loads with such a high velocity, as they hit the ceiling of the car, they rebounded, drenching everything in sight. He continued to scream as I felt my body almost drown in his cum. It was like watching a geyser. I was still pumping his cock, causing Joe to fall into a perpetual state of euphoria. I knew I was ready to cum too. However, just as I felt my balls twitch, I heard a knocking sound on the window behind me. It was Aku, who managed to break away from the group, who was now swimming in an ever-growing pool of their semen. His usual, warm smile spread across his face, ushering me to open the window. I obeyed, accepting my fate. One of his fists was clenched.<br />
<br />
“Can you feel the Spirit?”<br />
“I can….”<br />
“And how does it feel?”<br />
“It feels amazing! Ahhh, I’m gonna cum.”<br />
“Save it. Let it fill you. It will feel much better tonight, when you can finally release yourself from your old life, and become part of our tribe.”<br />
<br />
I suddenly saw a huge shadow loom over the car. Looking up at the mansion, my eyes widened. The roof was moving! The huge, glass dome was floating towards us! Before I could watch it cover the rest of the car in shade, Aku blew what looked like coloured ash into the vehicle. Feeling myself passing out, my head landed on Joe’s shoulder, who was still cuming at an immense rate. As I became unconscious, the last thing I could see was the dome fly over us, the intricate mechanisms attached to it spinning and whirring as it pushed the large structure further onto the lawn. I needed to cum, but I couldn’t stop myself from passing out. My hungry cock throbbed. I had no idea what was in store for us.</p>
