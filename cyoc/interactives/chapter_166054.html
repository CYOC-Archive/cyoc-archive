<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">you wake up groggily to the sound of an alarm, you&#39;re still sleeping on your side thanks to your new form, and reaching round your brother, who you note enviously hasn&#39;t woken up to the alarm, he was always the heavier sleeper... nevertheless, you manage, even with the new frontal weight to hit the snooze button. you then notice the tent your shared package is making, and wonder if you can knock one out without Dom noticing, you think back though to his anger last night when you lost control of your feelings and opt not to. You want to look at your phone and get up but with the sleepy extra weight, there is no chance of reaching that far on your bedside table. So instead you analyse the body more, as you noticed last night, there&#39;s a front side of you, where the things like your happy trail and bellybutton are on your new body. you never had a trail before, but Dom had, and you found it mildly arousing. as there&#39;s nowhere in the middle now, your joined genitals were all facing towards this middle part of you, you seem to still have a butt of your own though, and you see no reason to doubt you both still have your own anuses.  on the other side, you can&#39;t see it right now, but from seeing it earlier, you know it looks literally just like you had stood extremely close, and the skin melted into each other as if by magic. You could see your nipples and your brothers displaced slightly by the stretching skin towards the join too, they were at a slight angle by the pulling of the join, but touched sensitively, when your bodies pushed together. tracing your hand around told you that you could feel only your body, and the regions you shared, the join was sensitive and electric, and below, you could feel your half more, but you could definitely tell if your brother was thinking of something naughty in his dreams. the shared member was a sizeable 8 or so inches flaccid and you had no idea what size when you were both excited.<br />
<br />
you got pulled out of your anatomical analysis however, when you heard a yelling from downstairs &quot;Dom, Josh get down here, something&#39;s happened&quot; a strange androgynous voice you didn&#39;t recognise called out. you hear your brother stir, and as fast as a pair of newly merged 19 year olds could get out of bed, you did, though, Dom, still not very awake kept slumping his head on our shoulder, and letting his weight carry over. you drag him to your mirror and chest of drawers, and speak up, &quot;so what do we do about clothes then? the only 2 person thing we have are these pants...&quot; you gesture to the mysterious 4 legged underwear tightly packing everything in. <br />
&quot;you own baggy t-shirts... we could rip the neck to fit in that?&quot;<br />
&quot;I guess, but trousers?&quot;<br />
&quot;shoot&quot;<br />
<br />
after struggling to get into a t-shirt, a problem came clear fast: only two armholes, and so in the end, the two of you, called down to the impatient calling you&#39;d be coming, and then snuck over to Dom&#39;s room. In Doms room, the two of you find a tank top, and it fits well enough, you love seeing the four shoulders out, with yours and his biceps clearly exposed, touching slightly as the shirt, while fitting, still pulls the two of you even closer, you feel your nipples touching again like when you tried to look at your body earlier. for trousers, in the end, you found a pair of large sports shorts that may have been from someone your brother slept with but you didn&#39;t care, you each had to put your legs in like you were wearing them, but share the leg with your brothers, thankfully they were short enough to not restrict movement much, especially when to walk and probably to sit, you needed to be able to straddle each other. but it felt weird having them tight on your shared hips. &quot;this works I guess&quot; you say.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how long we&#39;re gonna be like this but we should definitely learn to sew though&quot;<br />
&quot;definitely.&quot;<br />
<br />
You squeeze your arms around your arms around Dom a little in reassurance and then the two of you start the sidestepping you&#39;ve become so used to to get to the stairs, the stairs were the worst thing you&#39;d had to deal with, and the first time you fell together, you crashed in a heap on the bottom step, your legs both sticking out like you had sat on Doms lap. You begin to laugh at the failure, and so does Dom, you can feel in your chests somewhere each others laughing strangely. You then however are pulled out of it by that voice again. &quot;Oh I see this will take a bit less explaining then&quot; You look up to see an androgynous person with one blue eye and one brown, pixie cut hair, and being this much closer to them, you could hear their voice was almost a mix of two more recognisable, the voice sounded like your mum and dad&#39;s voices harmonising to make a new one, and you noticed they had some strange clothing choices, mixing a waistcoat with a skirt, there clearly being a slight bulge underneath. the entity watched you familiarly. &quot;Who the fuck are you?&quot; Dom responds before you have a chance to open your mouth, clearly having yet to work out who this must be. &quot;Dom isn&#39;t it obvious&quot; you say smugly.<br />
&quot;no? what are you on about&quot;<br />
&quot;Boys, come sit down&quot; they say, helping you up. <br />
<br />
The two of you shuffle into the kitchen, and after a few attempts to work out how to sit, you work out that Dom can sit on the chair normally, after you turn it to the side, and you can sit on his lap, it&#39;s not great, but it works, even if it makes your join tighter as you are pushed slightly upwards. The person you assume is your parents puts a bowl of cereal down for each of you, and you both turn to the side as much as possible, to eat with one hand. And thank god you were right handed, and Dom,  left, or this would be a nightmare. As you ate, the figure explained that the news said there had been some fusion wave, and some amount of the population were merged to each other or objects, they then explained that they were both our parents to your brother who still hadn&#39;t quite caught up.<br />
&quot;so what do we call you?&quot; you said<br />
&quot;we... I... need some time to work that out, there&#39;s not much headspace in here right now, especially finding out you got hit too, and we&#39;re going to need to get you clothes and what will your other brother think when he&#39;s back from his field trip... hmm&quot;<br />
&quot;what do you mean get clothes, surely those aren&#39;t a thing, and we don&#39;t even know if its permanent&quot;<br />
&quot;actually... the wave apparently started a few days ago in Japan, they didn&#39;t tell us here in the UK to keep from panicking, but they&#39;ve studied it a bit, it looks like its probably permanent, and as for clothes, your aunt is a tailor, providing she didn&#39;t get hit, she can probably magic you up something more comfortable than that&quot; you nod, and stop eating too, noting that you&#39;re already full. you also notice your brother doing the same, both leaving half a bowl... It seems you share more than a penis and a chest, this is going to take some adjustment...</p>
