<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trevor Tyson was still holding his girlfriend Melissa Jenkins in his big strong werebull arms as the two continued to exchange kisses.<br />
Both of them were getting seriously lost in the moment, and soon Trevor would honor Mel&#39;s request to take her out somewhere in the fields and make love to her under the night stars, making her a werecow as Mel gave him her virginity.<br />
&quot;Oh, my knight in shining armor,&quot; said Mel between kisses. &quot;What are you waiting for? Let&#39;s find a quiet spot under the stars and fully express our love for each other.&quot;<br />
That made Trevor stop and think.<br />
<i>Okay, maybe my plan to do it tomorrow afternoon in my bedroom wasn&#39;t the greatest, but it was the best I could think of at the time,</i> he realized. <i>Yet is doing it now, tonight under the stars, as special and romantic as Mel deserves? I don&#39;t want to just rut with her, I want to make love with Mel. There is a difference, isn&#39;t there?</i> Trevor asked himself, even as Mel continued to kiss him.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE, WITHIN THE MOON LAKE HIGH SCHOOL GYM...<br />
<i>It&#39;s approaching 11,</i> Megumi Tachibana realized, after checking her watch. <i>She might not even still be up this late. Then again, it IS Halloween. But even if I just wind up talking to one of my cousins, I can&#39;t put this off any longer,</i> realized the werevixen, as she got out her cellphone and started to call her grandmother Tachibana no Akane, the leader of the Skulk.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE IN THE GYM...<br />
&quot;You look awful moody,&quot; said Virginia McCoy, as the weretigress approached her recently created weretiger fiance Harold Jenkins, who was sitting at a table near her chaperone station for the annual Halloween dance.<br />
&quot;Just a lot on my mind. Like the fact that I want to get Alice Decrux in my bare paws and...&quot; he said, while making strangling motions in the empty air.<br />
&quot;As much as I want to kick that were-raccoon&#39;s ass too, violence never solved anything,&quot; said Virginia gently, while moving behind Harold to start massaging his tense shoulders and neck. &quot;Principal Andrews is checking the security camera footage now. Between that and what&#39;s left of the punch tainted with Decrux&#39;s <i>Love Potion #9</i>, there will be plenty of evidence for the police and the court to go after her.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know, but Decrux isn&#39;t the only thing on my mind,&quot; confessed Harold.<br />
&quot;Mel,&quot; realized Virginia.<br />
&quot;Do you think what there is between Mel and Trevor is real? I don&#39;t want her committing to being a werecow, whenever Mel does decide to do so, and then regret her decision if she and Trevor break up for some reason later down the road.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know that, especially among normals, first love doesn&#39;t always mean only love. Remember, I was a normal before moving to Moon Lake myself,&quot; said Virginia, as she continued to massage her fiance. &quot;While things eventually didn&#39;t work out between myself and the weretiger who ushered me into were society, I&#39;ve never regretted becoming a weretigress, especially since it&#39;s led me to you,&quot; she added, before Virginia kissed the top of Harold&#39;s furry head.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s another thing I&#39;ve been thinking about. Us,&quot; confessed Harold.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said Virginia, starting to grow concerned about whatever he was about to say.<br />
&quot;For one thing, am I setting a good example for Mel with all the rutting we&#39;ve been doing since becoming a were myself?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;I—&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;ve enjoyed it immensely, but I realize now that I don&#39;t want to get married during the school&#39;s winter break,&quot; revealed Harold, getting up to face her.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said Virginia, growing more worried by the second.<br />
&quot;In fact,&quot; said Harold, taking her paws in his, &quot;my love for you is so great that I don&#39;t want to wait any longer than we absolutely have to,&quot; he said, smiling at her.<br />
Virginia started to feel a huge wave of relief overtake her as Harold added, &quot;All we really need is a marriage license and a Justice of the Peace, and with me not working at the college until the start of the Spring semester in January, I can track down and handle the paperwork now and we could get married next Saturday morning. What do you say Virginia McCoy? Would you like to become Mrs. Virginia Jenkins sooner than expected?&quot;<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; she exclaimed, before embracing Harold as the two started kissing.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
With whatever Trick or Treaters she had that Halloween night long since gone, Alice Decrux was sound asleep in her bed, dreaming pleasant dreams of her schemes being totally successful and Melissa Jenkins now a member of were society as a were-raccoon instead of whatever the red haired girl might have wanted to become. That would teach Melissa&#39;s father Harold not to have spurned her, instead of Alice turning Harold into a were-raccoon and having his baby just to collect child support and whatever else she could get out of him.<br />
The steady ringing of her front doorbell woke Alice up.<br />
Reluctantly getting out of bed, at first the were-raccoon thought maybe it was just a member of the Skulk or some other trickster pulling a Halloween prank. But when she peeled back the front window curtain just enough to see who was on her front porch, even as the doorbell continued to chime, Alice was totally surprised to see the four raccoon boys from the high school gym dressed as cowboys standing on her front porch.<br />
Not turning on the porch light to avoid attracting attention, since most weres could see in the dark to some extent, Alice opened the front door and said, &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;We did it!&quot; they exclaimed, practically in unison.<br />
&quot;Did what?&quot; Alice asked cautiously.<br />
&quot;We made sure that red haired lady drank some punch, just like you asked us too,&quot; said one were-raccoon proudly, while the other three nodded their heads in agreement.<br />
&quot;How?&quot; she wanted to know.<br />
&quot;We filled our water pistols with punch, then made sure she was in the middle of our gun fight,&quot; said another boy, while briefly pulling out his toy gun to show the older were female.<br />
&quot;Then what happened?&quot; asked Decrux.<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; said another were-raccoon boy, thinking fast, &quot;the girl started tugging at her dress collar, and the last we saw of her, she was talking to some weretiger.&quot;<br />
&quot;This weretiger, where was he? Who was he?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know who, but he was older, and the girl seemed to know him. He was standing by the refreshments table, last I saw,&quot; said the were-raccoon who had volunteered the answers, mixing lies and truth together.<br />
<i>OH MY!</i> Alice thought to herself. <i>Harold might have wound up committing incest with his own daughter! This went better than I hoped it would!</i> &quot;Then what happened?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know,&quot; admitted the talkative were. &quot;We wanted to get out of there, find you, and collect our reward,&quot; he said with a smile.<br />
&quot;Reward?&quot; Alice asked, a bit defensively.<br />
&quot;Yeah. Reward. You remember,&quot; said the boy, before thrusting his hips back and forth to mimic the action of having sex.<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Alice with a smile, thinking that having some sex with a horny teenage were might be a fun way to celebrate her victory. &quot;So, which one of you...&quot;<br />
&quot;All of us,&quot; said the first were-raccoon. &quot;Remember, we said <i>we</i> did it. The four of us staged the gun fight together and made sure that red haired girl got a good taste of the punch.&quot;<br />
&quot;All four of you, at once?&quot; asked Alice in disbelief.<br />
&quot;Yeah. What&#39;s wrong with that?&quot; wondered the boys, while looking over each other with confused looks on their furry faces.<br />
&quot;Hmm...,&quot; said Alice, thinking it over. <i>One in my pussy. Another up my ass while I suck the third, but what do I do with the fourth? And what if they all want to have a turn at each of my holes?</i><br />
Part of her was getting seriously turned on at the prospect of the impending orgy, as the boys noticed the nipples of Alice&#39;s breasts start to grow hard.<br />
Yet another thought crossed Alice&#39;s mind too. <i>Once Melissa Jenkins becomes a were against her will, regardless of who did the physical deed, the cops are going to eventually figure out that Love Potion #9 was involved. Maybe I better get out of town for awhile while the getting&#39;s good.</i><br />
She had a suitcase in the trunk of her car, all packed and ready to go in case of emergencies like this, and Alice Decrux knew plenty of horny weres elsewhere around the Pacific Northwest and Canada that she could lay low and have a good time with for awhile.<br />
<i>But four horny teenage boys at once?</i> she thought again, as Alice felt the moisture increase between her legs.<br />
&quot;Tell you what boys,&quot; Alice said with a smile, as she reached out to caress the furry sheaths of the two closest were-raccoons. &quot;My bed isn&#39;t big enough for all five of us, so why don&#39;t you fellows go around the house to my backyard and get ready, and I&#39;ll join you in a couple of minutes after I take another were-raccoon birth control pill.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; one said in disbelief, as the other two grew jealous that they weren&#39;t being fondled by the horny Mother I&#39;d (they&#39;d) Like to Fuck too.<br />
&quot;OKAY!&quot; they said excitedly, as they started to leave the porch to go around to the unfenced backyard of the Decrux house.<br />
<i>Okay Alice. What is it going to be? Fuck or flee?</i><br />
<br />
