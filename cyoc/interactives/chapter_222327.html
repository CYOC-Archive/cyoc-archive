<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Here&#39;s that second half that I mentioned. Hope y&#39;all enjoy. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was Todd who first perked up to a sudden change in atmosphere. Heavy footpaw steps could be heard descending the stairs, and with them came the distinct scent of man, of ripe dog in raunchy heat. His nose twitched once, twice, and he sat up from where he had been snuggled into Dave’s strong arms to see what was up. <br />
<br />
From his place on the couch, Todd watched as Chuck and Buck approached the two husbands lounging on the couch. The two doms were grinning that wide shit eating pittie grin, the one that typically meant trouble. <br />
<br />
And trouble did the twins bring.<br />
<br />
Their long heavy strides closed the distance to the couch quickly, before Todd could say anything. And with their approach, a thick wall of musk followed, rapidly replacing the air in the room with the scent of man in heat. The pungent odor flooded Todd’s senses, and began to cloud his mind. <br />
<br />
Dave too began to feel the effects of the twins’ funk. He swiveled his head to look behind him, and looked up and up and up at the two looming bullies. <br />
<br />
“‘Sup.” Buck said simply, less questioning and more so asserting. <br />
<br />
“Uhh, hey.” Dave replied, a bit confused. <br />
<br />
What were the twins doing down here? They couldn’t be done with Jeff and Finn yet, could they? Those two were insatiable bottoms. Dave wasn’t sure how it was possible that two of the most domineering men could both give rise to such submissive dick sluts for progeny, and yet that was Jeff and Finn to a T. <br />
<br />
“Was there something we could help you with?”<br />
<br />
Buck chuckled. “Yeah there was actually. Why don’t you hand over your little cock hungry husband and I can show you?”<br />
<br />
That rubbed Dave the wrong way entirely. It was one thing if he or Mike talked dirty to Todd (who always found it considerably hot to be demeaned and objectified), but it was definitely not okay for one of his son’s boyfriends to do so. Dave stood up to command a little more presence to this punk.<br />
<br />
“Alright listen here…” Dave wasn’t able to finish his sentence. With lightning speed Buck had reached behind his head and pulled him in for a deep kiss. <br />
<br />
Dave’s initial shock gave way to reciprocity. Why wasn’t he fighting this? Buck’s long tongue felt incredible as it forced its way deeper down his throat. He wanted to fight it, but it was like cotton had been stuffed between his ears and logical thinking was impossible.<br />
<br />
Todd could only watch in a mixture of awe and arousal. Had some little (or rather big) shit really just talked smack and then forced himself on his husband? It was rude… but undeniably hot. Todd felt a large hand with think pads forcefully grip his should, and begin to pull him up from where he had been kneeling on the couch. The hand spun him around, and he was face to face with Chuck, who eyed him with just a hint of demonic glee. <br />
<br />
Without a word, Todd found himself suffering the same fate as his husband, pit bull tongue forced into his mouth. He too quickly gave in to Chuck’s authority, and began to tangle his own tongue with the new invader. <br />
<br />
Chuck began to run his hands up and down Todd’s body, taking a second to grab a thick handful of his fat ass and give it a hefty squeeze, eliciting a jump and squeal from the panda. Buck, following suit, took a liking to pinching one of Dave’s love handles and pulling a nipple, which sent lightning bolts straight through his cock. <br />
<br />
The twins finally stopped their make outs and let the two dads come up for air. Their reprieve was short lived however, as they were shoved backwards onto the couch. Chuck and Buck each grabbed their new victims’ pants and without hesitation yanked them off, exposing the prizes they so desired to claim for their own.<br />
<br />
Dave was confused. He was supposed to be the top. He loved the feeling of his thick cock buried deep in his husband’s fat asshole. He looked over to Todd…<br />
<br />
And was shocked to see the panda with legs up in the air, pulling fervently at his cock with one hand and spreading a cheek with the other. The look in his eyes was delirious with lust. <br />
<br />
It was now that Chuck moved in on his prey. He pulled apart Todd’s fat cheeks, buried his muzzle in the ass before him, and began to lap at his hole. Todd’s breathing quickened, and he let out an exasperated sigh of pleasure. Chuck’s powerful tongue pressed firmly inwards until it found its way through the back door where it began its exploration deeper into Todd’s anus. Chuck reached a finger from each hand towards Todd’s hole and, while still lubing the back door with his tongue, began to pull and stretch apart the tight donut. <br />
<br />
The longer Dave watch the handsome pittie and his delusional husband, the more uneasy he became. The panda’s legs reached closer down to his head, and his once rotund stomach shrank in on itself until it was a cute little gut. Todd’s handsome panda beard receded into his jaw, which went from pudgy but strong to soft and round. <br />
<br />
Most notably of all, Todd’s relentless jerking of his dick was slowly becoming less and less spectacular. His once respectable dick meat crept back into his groin. Todd’s plump testes jumped upwards in their sack, and with each jump they grew smaller and tighter to his pelvis. Todd’s genitals were slowly reduced to a measly few inches with a tight little scrotum to match.<br />
<br />
Despite all of these changes, one thing did remain the same; Todd’s voluptuous ass. From his position at Todd’s hole, Chuck finally stopped his slobbery assault and removed his tongue and fingers. Saliva hung sticky across Todd’s anus.<br />
<br />
Dave was frightened, and yet he couldn’t take his eyes off of the panda. His once heavy set, jello tummied man of a husband had been completely replaced by a pudgy little twink.<br />
<br />
It was then that Chuck pressed his billy club cock against Todd’s tight anus and, with little hesitation, thrust forcefully forward. Todd howled in pain and pleasure, his now inexperienced asshole no longer accustomed to such large invaders. <br />
<br />
“Relax your gut,” Chuck commanded, to which Todd complied immediately, allowing in another couple inches from Chuck.<br />
<br />
“Good. Now tighten your abs.” Again Todd complied. <br />
<br />
“Relax… and tighten… relax…” directed Chuck, leading Todd into a rhythm. With each repetition, Todd was able to pull in a little bit more of Chuck’s length, and all the while massaging the inches already inside of him. <br />
<br />
Dave had practically forgotten about Buck looming over him, so enthralled with the uncanny display of dominance happening to his husband. Buck would not be left out of the fun however. <br />
<br />
Buck snapped his fingers. <br />
<br />
“Look at me.” he commanded. Without hesitation Dave looked Buck in the eyes.<br />
<br />
“That’s better.”<br />
<br />
Buck squatted down between Dave’s legs. Without breaking eye contact, he opened his grinning maw and in one fluid motion took the entirely of Dave’s huge cock in his mouth, deepthroating it with ease. Dave lost his breath at the magnificent display of sexual prowess. In all his years he’d never felt such incredible pleasure along his cock. It was as if Buck’s tight throat was sending static charges along his dick, which traveled up his length and into his brain, where he was unable to process anything else going on. <br />
<br />
Buck reached under Dave and began to massage around his anus with a thick finger. Dave gasped again, feeling as if his hole was reaching out toward the digit. He ground his ass downward towards the uninvited guest. As if to oblige, Buck inserted one knuckle deep, then two knuckles, until finally his entire finger had been sucked into Dave’s rectum. <br />
<br />
But to Dave it wasn’t enough. Where was this needy feeling coming from? <br />
<br />
“Agmhhh… mmh… mmmore…” Dave whimpered, unbefitting his deep bass.<br />
<br />
Buck grinned around Dave’s cock, and released his throaty grip from his penile prisoner…<br />
<br />
Only to reveal a tiny little bit of cock from between his lips. Dave’s eyes went wide in shock.<br />
<br />
“Nnngh grahhh… this isn’t… this isn’t right…” he groaned more highly. <br />
<br />
“What do you mean little ram? You’ve always been a tiny dicked little slut.”<br />
<br />
“No! That’s not…”<br />
<br />
Dave couldn’t finish his sentence, as Buck inserted another finger into his ass and, like a homing missile, jammed them straight into his prostate, eliciting a high pitched moan of pleasure not befitting a big dominant man. <br />
<br />
Which, to be fair, would no longer describe Dave; every one of his features had diminished in masculinity. The once tall, beefy, and virile ram couldn’t possibly be taller than 5’2” in height and barely 100 pounds soaking wet. Strong jaw and heavy brows were replaced with slight features. Atop his head, where once sat two regal and commanding horns were instead two little bony nubs, at this point likely the hardest parts of Dave’s diminished body. Of course, Dave’s megalithic cock and cum heavy nuts had been replaced with only a few inches of painfully hard peen erect over a tight little scrote. <br />
<br />
As with the fate of his son, the only part of Dave’s body which had seen any form of augmentation was centered entirely around his rear. Beneath a thick layer of fat were two massively powerful globes of gluteal muscle, which only served as the pearly gates to the tight yet accommodating anus within. If bottoming were an Olympic sport, Dave’s ass would take gold every time. <br />
<br />
Buck was getting impatient. His brother next to him had been going to town balls deep with Todd for the better of the last 15 minutes or so. Chuck had lifted Todd up off the couch and bounced him aggressively on his dick, decimating the poor guy through repeated obliteration on his thick knot. Todd had lost contact with reality at this point; the only reality that mattered was the girth which cramped his anus and rubbed against his needy walls. <br />
<br />
Deciding that foreplay was over, Buck placed Dave’s slender legs on his shoulders and, with no warning, crammed his cock into Dave’s waiting hole. <br />
<br />
With a bleated scream of pleasure, Dave head rolled back as he came. The tiniest wad of cum rocketed from his dick, signaling the completion of his and Todd’s downfall. Where two massive dominating dads once stood instead saw a pair of shrunken mindless twinks incapable of raising even the slightest form of resistance to authority. Heavy set figures and heavier set guts had been replaced with tight stomachs and svelte musculature. And of course, the once prestigious meat the two held between their legs was gone, and instead saw inflated rear-ends as their most prominent trait. <br />
<br />
The men that Todd and Dave had once been were no more; the high pitched breathy moans coming from them now was evident of that. The two were fucked roughly into oblivion by the twin doms Chuck and Buck, and they couldn’t have wanted it any other way. <br />
<br />

<br />
As the newly formed husband twinks were receiving the ass filling of a lifetime downstairs, Jeff was only just now coming to upstairs. Yawning an ill-fitting toothy tiger yawn from his little tiger maw, Jeff untangled himself from his mate. In the corner, the Chronivac beeped. Jeff rose and delicately sat his large sore bottom down at the computer. <br />
<br />
“Retroactive changes complete. What would you like to change?”<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn’t sure what retroactive changes the computer was referring to, but he felt as though they couldn’t have been good. Taking a moment to think, Jeff decides…</p>
