<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Ram stood in front of the class and said I have some instructions for you and you must follow them to the <br />
letter.<br />
<br />
Now take your book and open them to any random page.<br />
<br />
Read the first paragraph you see.<br />
<br />
As Kelly opened the book she read the first paragraph on the right hand page. It talked about drag queens. As <br />
she read she felt her focus changing. It seemed as though she was getting further away from the page and her <br />
eyes had to re adjust. As she read the page she noticed that her fingers seemed to be getting longer but her <br />
finger nails were now long fake nails. She felt her hair rustle. As she lifter her hand to feel what was going <br />
on, thinking that someone was touching her hair, she realized that she now had on a big Texas hair style wig. <br />
Her chest seemed to deflate but it was replaced with a larger shelf than she had ever known. Her outfit became <br />
a glittery blue short outfit. And there seemed to be something taped between her legs. She reached down and <br />
felt something there. She picked up her matching purse and pulled out a compact and looked at herself. In the <br />
mirror was now one of the ugliest girls she had ever seen. Very masculine features and even a hint of a beard <br />
showing through makeup that was obviously applied to hide the fact. She looked around and all the girls were <br />
in some stage of change.<br />
<br />
The cheerleaders, in their normal fashion, couldn't follow instructions exactly so they had all turned to the <br />
same page. At least they all had read different paragraphs. It was about bear culture. Brittany read the one <br />
about bears and she was becoming one of the biggest hulking hairiest bears Kelly had ever seen. She looked <br />
like a long shore man. She had a big black beard and a baseball cap on. Her healthy breasts became massive <br />
pecs. Her arms and legs shortened just as her torso did and she became a 5'6&quot; man but she aged to her mid <br />
30's. Her stomach, while not fat, had shown some healthy living. She was now in some tight jeans, but then <br />
anything on this man would have been tight. She had on a flannel shirt and the one thing that seemed out of <br />
place was that she had on black rimmed glasses.<br />
<br />
Tara read her chapter and she didn't get big, in fact she became more muscular, lost her breasts, and although <br />
she didn't become very hairy but her chest was exposed showing a fairly heavy amount of fur on her pecs. <br />
Although her hips did widen a bit they weren't that wide. Where as Brittany wouldn't have shown anything <br />
between her legs, Tara sported quite the python snaking down her right leg and this was soft. She was dressed <br />
similar to Brittany, jeans and a flannel shirt with leather boots. But her jeans were newer and her shirt was <br />
of a different color. It looked as though she was trying to grow a beard but was only able to grow a goatee. <br />
But she did have a baseball cap.<br />
<br />
Lynn had made the biggest change. She read the part about the sub category that associate as bears but are not <br />
really part of the bear group. She read about the chub category. As Kelly watched Lynn blew up like a balloon. <br />
Her breasts while rather large before tripled in size and wrapped around to the back fat. Her hips widened and <br />
her belly jutted out. Her thighs began to rub together and her face rounded out. She developed double and <br />
triple chins and her hands became round. Whereas Brittany grew shorter and Tara became somewhat taller she <br />
remained the same height but the 500 pounds of chub made her look shorter. Her outfit changed into a harness <br />
that wrapped around her back and under her now massive chest. It went down her back side and between her legs <br />
and up her belly stopping off for a ring around her cock. Now it was very hidden but the pressure on the <br />
harness made it poke through the ring. She was in some rather skimpy daisy duke leather shorts with straps <br />
along the side stretched to the max. Lynn frantically turned to a different page and began reading. Nothing <br />
happened. Once they read their paragraph that was their change.<br />
<br />
Kelly looked around and saw one of the black girls turn into a ginger twink.<br />
<br />
And another girl with a dildo sticking out of her ass that looked like a log.<br />
<br />
Kelly surveyed the changes occurring around her each different from the others.</p>
