<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Each wish has to consist of at least two lines.  Line 1: the Descriptor.  Sets up the background for the spell.  Line 2: the &quot;command&quot; part of the spell, what is said in this line happens in realy life. Each and every wish or spell has to be vocally spoken and it has to rhyme, the better the rhyme the closer the effect is to the intent of the wand wielded.  Bad rhymes will result in twisted effects.  The effect will take affect on whoever the wand is pointed at as the final word is said! Have fun with your wand!&quot;<br />
<br />
For your first spell you say, &quot;Becuase of the wand wielders I am now a member, from now on will no one my wishes remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alright now to make your step sister a smokeshow.  You say, &quot;Now that my morale is up, make my steps sisters boobs a D-cup.&quot; And then her boobs started growing.  Her nipples became hard and were visible through both her bra and her shirt!  She started to breath more heavily.  With each breath you saw her chest rise, but her boobs did not fall, they enlarged with every breath, growing and growing.  Until they were about the size of cantaloupes on her chest.  Jutting out from her chest.  <br />
But you didn&#39;t like how they looked like someone taped inflated balloons to her chest. You waved the wand and said. &quot;Your boobs are now sure to grab eyes, so it&#39;s very important that they natural-ize!&quot; Once you finished the rhyming-spell a green spark came out of the tip of the wand and hit her right in her chest and her boobs began to change shape.  You saw more and more of the boob flesh sink down below the nipple, while the nipple remained at the same height.  Once They stopped shifting her boobs seemed to form a &quot;ski slope&quot; of sorts.  Then you saw her nipples and areolas actually grow as well! They grew until she had about 50 cent pieces for areoles and tootsie rolls for nipples.  You assumed that they must have had to grow to be &quot;naturalized&quot; along with her large mammaries.  They were now very pronounced out of her shirt as they were still very hard. Your step sister was a little bit pudgy, nothing too bad, but something you could improve on and she had an almost abnormally flat butt for a girl of her body shape. You decided to solve both of these problems with one wish. You said, &quot;Because your ass is very flat, let us move to there half of your fat.&quot; Her body, especially in fattier areas like her stomach and thighs, looked as though it was bubbling like it was in a witch&#39;s cauldron.  As time went on the bubbling areas moved to her butt and eventually slowed and stopped.  Now her butt was much bigger, but much like her boobs her butt cheeks were abnormally shaped.  So you thought of another wish to make to make her big ass look like a work of art.  This was going to take some work to word this wish the right way so you asked the bartender for a napkin and pen and wrote down what you thought might work.  &quot;Your butt is bigger and that&#39;s a good start, but your hips will be wider, it&#39;ll be so juicy you can&#39;t hide-her, and heart shaped so I&#39;ll guide-her, and also you can&#39;t fart.&quot;  This was a long and elaborate rhyme, one part of it didn&#39;t even make sense.  But the instructions only said that it had to rhyme.  The words all rhymed so it should be pretty good. So you went ahead and said it while waving the wand at her.  All of the fat that was previously piled onto her ass melted down into two pillowy masses of fat. She shifted her legs and feet as her hips widened and her ass took on the upside down heart shape.   Then you heard a strange bubbling sound that must have been the effect of the last line of the wish.  <br />
She now had one of the best racks and one of the best asses you have ever seen! And because of her already beautiful face she was like a goddess among men! You wanted to see exactly what she looked like without her clothes on, but since you weren&#39;t quite done with her and you liked the potential selection of people here you decide to do something else.  You choose to give yourself glasses that let you see through clothes! &quot;Seeing how everyone here is such a prude, these glasses I have allow me to see everybody nude!&quot; Immediately a pair of glasses appear in your hand and you put them on to look at the girl and through the window you can see your neighbors male gardener nude! You quickly take them off and say &quot;I think I accidentally saw some chodes, now these glasses have 2 gender modes.&quot;  A switch appeared on the left side of the glasses that had a blue dot and a pink dot.  You move to switch to the pink dot and put the glasses back on.  Okay, much better now. You can see your step sister now standing in front of the TV.  Her large and luscious ass swaying slightly, and her amazing bust moving up and down with each breath.  You like her boobs, but you wanted them to move around more.  You know she is wearing a bra, one quick wish can fix that. &quot;You have the best rack that I ever saw, now you are no longer wearing a bra!&quot; Her boobs dropped slightly and bounced a bit, but still retained their shape, much to your enjoyment. But there was still something else that you wanted them to have, a sort of jiggliness that would make them bounce at the slightest movement.  You say,&quot;Now that your boobs are all nice and biggly, let&#39;s make your boobs extra perky and jiggly!&quot; Ooooo.  This was a nice one.  Her boobs raised up yet again as if they were in a bra, but they had  much more freedom now.  Her boobs bounced around even as she was standing still in fact they bounced around almost too much! That was probably Becuase you rhymed jiggly with biggly, which isn&#39;t even a real word.  Oh well it looks pretty hot. It was so erotic.  And you became very very aroused and are almost cumming in your pants.  Your rock hard penis was pushing against the fabric begging for release. She jumped a little bit to move her shirt and it sent waves of ripples over her perfect ass and her boobs were all over the place.  Somehow you were still holding on and you didn&#39;t finish.  You decided it was best to avoid an accident and make a quick wish. &quot;Because of all this I&#39;m really hard, make it so I&#39;m not so hard!&quot; Once you made the wish you felt your penis shrink, but not your arousal,  you were still on the verge of climax but your penis continued to  shrink.  It was them that you remembered that the effect would be closer to your intentions the better the rhyme, but you just rhymed the same word with the same word, oh crap what&#39;s going to happen??? You penis shrank more until it was non existent.  Then a hole started to form and grow deeper and deeper! You weren&#39;t hard any more, but now you had a vagina! And you were still extremely aroused!!! Once the transformation stopped you felt it getting wetter and wetter, and once you looked down you noticed you could see through your clothes!!! You were technically a girl now! You looked back up at the girl and her body turns you on even more! Boobs jiggling, ass swaying, you couldn&#39;t take any more! Within seconds of becoming &quot;female&quot; you were having your first female orgasm in the middle of a bar!!! You feel it happening but feel no need to scream loudly,  you put your mouth over your arm and are panting loudly.  Juices squirt out of your new vag and soak your pants.  </p>
