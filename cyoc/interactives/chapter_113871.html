<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa thought about her reflection&#39;s question for a bit and then replied, &quot;Well, I am leaning towards being a werefox.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her reflection smiled and then shimmered to change to herself as a werefox.  The first thing that Melissa noticed is how voluptuous her werefox-self was.  She noticed that most of her fur was red, with white fur covering her entire front, from her lower jaw down to her crotch.  She also noticed the black fur covering her hands and feet like elegant gloves and shoes.  &quot;What do you think?&quot; her reflection asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s very...beautiful,&quot; Melissa responded slowly.  Her reflection turned around to show her back, including her fluffy tail, which was red like the rest of her back save for a bit of white fur at the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, let me ask you something,&quot; Melissa&#39;s reflection said while still in her werefox form.  &quot;Why a werefox?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve been reading in this book,&quot; Melissa responded as she got the book from her bed, &quot;Werefoxes are not just beautiful vixens, but also have an instinctual sense of what people need.  Not just with sex, but with many other things.  I read this and thought to myself that this describes myself quite a bit.  Before we moved here, I was always the &#39;mom&#39; of my group of friends.  I really can&#39;t quite explain it, but it seems that I always know what people need when they need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile formed on Melissa&#39;s reflection vulpine muzzle, and then she asked, &quot;Is there anything else I could show you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Melissa started as she thought a bit.  It was only a dream, but as long as she was here...  &quot;Could you show me what I would look like as a werecow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; her reflection answered as it shimmered.  When it cleared up, it was Melissa as a werecow.  She was easily twice the size of her werevixen counterpart.  One thing that caught Melissa&#39;s eyes were the size of her breasts.  While as a werevixen, her breasts were a bit larger than hers as a normal human, but as a werecow, they were four to five times the size.  She also noticed an udder down between her crotch and her stomach.  Red fur covered her entire body, and she noticed the hooves for feet and her hands also were a bit hoove-like, only she could see the fingers.  Her nose and jaw extended out into a thick muzzle, and she could see small horns on top of her head.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re...big,&quot; Melissa responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, werebovines tend to get big, much like werehorses.  Curious as to see what you would look like if you changed with Trevor?&quot;  Melissa nodded her answer.  &quot;Understandable,&quot; her reflection replied.  &quot;I&#39;d be curious as well if I were you.  Although, one of the nice things about being a werecow is the incredible strength they have.  Not just physical strength, mind you, but a tenacity not seen in other weres.  So, anything else I can show you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa and her reflection discussed various other fursonas that she could be, including a werewolf, a weretiger, a wererabbit, a wereorca, and even a weremer.  Melissa admitted that her as a weremer looked too much like an R-rated version of the Little Mermaid.  She joked that if she did become a weremer, she ought to get a crab and name it Sebastian.<br />
<br />
The night soon ended with a buzzing from her alarm clock signaling the end of the night and the start of a new day.  Melissa soon awoke and shut off her clock.  As she lay in bed pondering what she dreamt about, she had a more firm decision about what should become.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Meanwhile, while Melissa was dreaming, her father Harold was also having a dream.  He was dreaming that he was in his office working on something.  He heard a knock on the door and saw a man dressed in a suit with a bowler hat.  &quot;Can I help you?&quot; Harold asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; the man replied as he walked in and sat in a chair on the other side of his desk, &quot;The question should be is if I can help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon?&quot; Harold asked as he looked up at the man sitting on the other side of his desk.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is the question, now isn&#39;t it?&quot; The man smiled as he sat back.  &quot;Some call me the spiritual guide of this town.  Others call me its protector.  Yet, others call me names that I&#39;d rather not repeat here.  If you want, you can call me whatever you want.  This is your dream, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I am dreaming, huh?&quot; Harold said as he laced his fingers together in thought.  &quot;So, why are you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man pointed at Harold and said, &quot;I&#39;m here to talk about you.&quot;  Harold blinked in surprise.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I only help those who are stuck and need to hear me.  Anyway, let&#39;s talk first about Melissa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about her?&quot; Harold asked, staring at the man with a deep scowl on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about her.  She&#39;s trying to figure stuff out, but I think she&#39;ll make the right decision for the right reasons.  Now, with that said, let&#39;s talk about you.  Why did you come here to Moon Lake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold sighed and then said, &quot;I wanted a new lease on life.  Things have been difficult for me ever since my wife died a few years ago.  I had to get away because everything reminded me of the happy life my wife and I shared together, and it drove me crazy.  I had to go somewhere far away, and when I saw this job at the Moon Lake College, I jumped at the opportunity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you wanted a new life, this is the place,&quot; the man said as he chuckled.  His face went serious for a moment and then said, &quot;I understand that your transition here hasn&#39;t been the smoothest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s an understatement.  Ever since I heard about this Mandatory  Were law, I was besides myself as to what to do.  I&#39;ll admit, I was more than tempted to just pack up and leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good thing you didn&#39;t.  If you had, they would have chased you down and turned you against your will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t.  I didn&#39;t want to make things worse.  Still, the lady that came here, the werecat, she could have been a bit more...gentle with her reveal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to forgive her.  She&#39;s been under a bit of stress lately, what with a rogue were-vixen and the upcoming wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Harold said with a bit of a nod.  &quot;So, now Mel&#39;s wanting to change, and while as her father, I&#39;m a bit apprehensive about it.  But at least she&#39;s willing, and as her father...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d do anything to protect her,&quot; the man said finishing Harold&#39;s sentence.  Harold nodded with understanding.  &quot;So, what about you?  Have you considered changing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Harold said as he moved his head back a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let me put it to you this way.  You have two ladies who have their sights on you.  One of them is Virginia McCoy, although she hasn&#39;t really shown it much yet.  The other is Alice Decrux, and I&#39;d be careful with her.  I think she just wants to mark you as her conquest and use your sperm for her cubs.  At any rate, if you&#39;re going to be with either one of those two, you&#39;ll need to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I see,&quot; Harold said.  &quot;Well, it&#39;s something that I haven&#39;t really thought about.  I know Mel&#39;s been pushing me to get back to dating, but it&#39;s been difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; the man said while smiling.  &quot;Take your time.  Moon Lake is a special place, and it has an ability to heal and mend wounds, especially wounds of the heart.  It&#39;ll take time, but the best piece of advice that I can give is to follow your heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
A loud buzzing noise rang throughout the room, signaling the end of the night.  &quot;Well,&quot; the man said as he rose from his chair, &quot;it appears our time here is done.  If you need any help, I&#39;ll be sure to be around.&quot;  The man extended his hand as Harold rose up out of his chair to shake the man&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
At the next moment, Harold was in bed, the alarm buzzing loudly next to him.  He reached over to shut the alarm off, and then rolled back to stare at the ceiling.  Who was that man?  Was Virginia really that interested in him?  What should he do about Alice?  And what about Mel?  Was she doing the right thing?  These thoughts and more ran through his head as he got up and started to get ready for the day.</p>
