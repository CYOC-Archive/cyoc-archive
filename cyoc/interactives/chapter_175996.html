<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">J: let’s just be normal. I’d probably ruin it for the both of us if we pretended to be toddlers.<br />
<br />
G: good idea. Let’s delete these texts.<br />
<br />
The two struggled with their new bodies, but were able to delete the texts.<br />
<br />
G: actually I have an idea. We should pretend like we woke up like this. It’ll make them think we are extremely shocked about it.<br />
<br />
J: like what? Screaming?<br />
<br />
G: yea let’s scream. Delete these texts and I’ll scream.<br />
<br />
The two deleted the texts once more. Jacob put his phone down and got ready. <br />
<br />
Not a second later when a little boy’s scream is heard. Jacob heard Greg and followed the plan. He screamed like he was being murdered.<br />
<br />
The two could hear footsteps run up the stairs. Greg’s mother ran to Jacob, while his father ran to Greg.<br />
<br />
“What’s the-“ she saw the toddler boy resembling Jacob sit up in bed. She approached slowly, not believing what she’s seeing. “Jacob?” She asked.<br />
<br />
Jacob nodded his head. She embraced the scared and confused boy, trying to make him feel safe. “How did this happen sweetheart?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know! One minute I’m asleep, and the next I hear someone scream and I wake up to this.”<br />
<br />
“Well it’s ok. I’ve got you. No need to worry!” She picked Jacob up and cradled him as she walked to Greg’s room. <br />
<br />
She didn’t even have to step down his hallway to hear her toddlerfied son. <br />
<br />
“Put me down! I can walk!” Greg complained.<br />
<br />
“We don’t know what happened to you, and we cannot have you walk down the stairs in your current state!” His dad said.<br />
<br />
Jacob and Dian looked at each other, “I guess Greg is a little boy too.” She said.<br />
<br />
Greg’s father walked down the hall holding his son by his armpits. He was facing forward and held like he was some object.<br />
<br />
“Jake dear, please hold your son correctly!” Dian asked of him.<br />
<br />
“I’m not risking him pissing on me!” He replied.<br />
<br />
“That’s true, but at least hold him right. I’m pretty sure Greg wouldn’t want a spanking, so he’ll tell you when he has to go.”<br />
<br />
Greg’s dad slowly cradled his son close to his chest. The two walked downstairs while carrying the boys. They took them to their bathroom, where they are placed on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Honey, go get diapers that are size 4. It doesn’t matter what designs they are, just make sure they’re for boys.” Dian ordered. Her husband understood and left.<br />
<br />
“Now, it’s been a while since we’ve done this. But I’m currently going to need you two to try to be good boys. If you need to use the potty, tell mommy!”<br />
<br />
“Can you not say mommy and potty, we’re still 16 in here!” Greg tapped on his head indicating that they’re still mentally the same.<br />
<br />
“Yes I know, but it’s easier to talk to you two like that. We don’t know what happened, or how long this will last. Just in case you two start again, I am getting you used to baby talk.<br />
<br />
“Well that’s dumb! Right Jacob?” Greg turned to his friend who nodded in response.<br />
<br />
Jacob felt embarrassed being fully nude as a toddler in front of his best friend’s mother. He didn’t mind being nude back when he was a little kid, but being 16 made him aware of how rude and awkward it was to be nude in front of people.<br />
<br />
Greg’s mother stood over them as the two boys sat on the tile floor. Eventually, Jacob had to go.<br />
<br />
“Uh, I gotta go!” He said.<br />
<br />
“Do you gotta go pee pee or poo poo sweetie?”<br />
<br />
“I have to pee!”<br />
<br />
Jacob was lifted up and placed on the toilet in a way that he’s facing it. He held his shrunken member as he used the toilet. When he finished, he was placed back on the floor. Dian flushed the toilet and the three waited some more.<br />
<br />
The sound of a door opening and a man running could be heard. Greg’s dad came into the bathroom holding a box of diapers and a bag of changing supplies.<br />
<br />
“I forgot about wipes! Thanks honey!” Dian opened the box and began to change Greg. Jake did the same with Jacob. The entire time Greg kept complaining about being diapered. Claiming that it ruined his pride. Jacob knew this entire thing was his friend’s idea, but he assumed he was playing it off to avoid his parents thinking he liked it.<br />
<br />
After the diapers were put on the boys, they were placed on their feet and left alone in the bathroom. The two of them looked at each other and Greg laughed, “Look at you! It’s like you’re in first grade again!”<br />
<br />
“Greg we’re both in diapers so shut up!”<br />
<br />
Jacob and Greg looked at their new undergarments. It was a normal white diaper with designs in the middle. It was blue with cartoon characters that neither of them have seen or heard of.<br />
<br />
“I wonder if these are those diapers that have the designs disappear when we use them?” Jacob asked.<br />
<br />
“Aren’t those with the old people diapers?” <br />
<br />
“I think, but wouldn’t it be easier to check a diaper’s design to see if it’s wet?”<br />
<br />
“Yea, you have a point. I wonder where my mom and dad went?” Greg waddled over to the front door with Jacob following him. The two walked out of Greg’s parent’s bedroom and heard them in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“We’re telling you! Both our and your son became little boys again! Ours was acting like an actual toddler when we put them in diapers!” Dian said. <br />
<br />
“And my son?” Jacob’s mother’s voice said. <br />
<br />
The two boys looked at each other with worry now that Jacob’s parents are now involved.<br />
<br />
“Your son was very quiet about the diaper change. I’m not sure if he felt embarrassed about me changing him though.” Jake said.<br />
<br />
“Well Jacob has been shy and embarrassed about the whole diaper thing growing up. Just make sure to let him feel however he wishes to feel like.” His mom said.<br />
<br />
“Do you wish to see Jacob? He’s in the bathroom with Greg right now. The two of them are probably making fun of each other’s diapers.” Dian offered.<br />
<br />
Jacob grabbed Greg’s arm and pulled him all the way back to the bathroom. <br />
<br />
“Dude we gotta puke the pill!” Jacob whispered.<br />
<br />
“I’m not puking in front of my mom! What if our diapers tear off! The two of us haven’t been nude in front of our parents since those swimming days at the community pool!” He whispered back.<br />
<br />
The sound of Greg’s and Jacob’s parents got closer.<br />
<br />
“Too late!” Greg said.</p>
