<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night Mark lay on his bed holding a book in front of his face as if he were reading. His mind, however had wandered elsewhere long ago. He could think of nothing else besides his new found ability as he unconciously flexed his larger biceps. All his focus was on deciding what to change next. Every time he made a decision, he changed his mind. It was maddening.<br />
He mulled over his exciting possibilites in temporary solitude since his roomate Jason was in the shower; he had the two person dorm room to himself when inspiration struck. Suddenly the sound of water stopped and a sopping wet Jason entered through the bathroom door in all his naked glory. <br />
The sight snapped Mark out of his trance as he took in his roomate's toned body. Jason was lean and ripped with wide shoulders hugging closely to his large but flat pecs. Jason's huge calfs and taught firm ass certainly confirmed his status as a tennis player, as did his vascular biceps. His cut cobblestone six-pack was dappled with a treasure trail that led Mark's eyes down to his thick bush and tremendous manhood framed by shredded quads. <br />
Despite his impressing limp cock and sizable nutsack bouncing with his steps, Jason was very nonchalante about his nudity, simply walking to his closet and grabbing a towel. Jason wished he knew its size and immediately saw in his mind: 6&quot; soft, 9&quot; hard. NINE INCHES! Mark was flabbergasted, sporting only a seven inch dick himself. <br />
As Jason began to dry his enormous package, Mark sat up on his bed and pretended to just now notice his roomate's cock.<br />
&quot;Dude, you are super hung,&quot; Mark said admonishingly with a look of disbelief in his eyes. <br />
Jason dropped the towel and faced Mark. &quot;Oh, thanks man,&quot; he said, smirking. He put his hands on his hips and stared admiringly down at his own hefty meat. &quot;Yeah, I'm fucking big. Once word got out that I had horsedick, all the girls at my high school were lining up to let me fuck them.&quot; Mark realized that Jason's sexy memories were turning him on as the naked man's cock began to stiffen and grow.<br />
&quot;How big are you,&quot; asked Mark feigning ignorance to keep the conversation going.<br />
&quot;Nine fat inches of manhood,&quot; replied Jason, his thick sausage now resting horizontally. He grabbed his semihard dick and moaned. &quot;Mmmmm. Hey, man is it okay if I jerk to some porn. I just woke the beast.&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh... Sure,&quot; said Mark.<br />
&quot;Great.&quot; Jason sat in front of his computer with one hand still on his now fully erect cock, and brought up a bookmarked page. Mark began to bone up as he saw two women with large, round tits licking each other. Jason leaned back and started stroking his huge phallus.<br />
&quot;So how big are you?&quot; Jason asked offhandedly, not actually looking away from the screen. <br />
Mark, now confident with his ability decided it was time to go over the top. &quot;Heh, I'm eleven inches,&quot; he said, feeling the enormous increase in weight between his legs. Mark realized he had made a critical error and quickly added, &quot;And a pair of huge balls to match.&quot; His crotch stirred as his testicles swelled in proportion to his big manhood. <br />
&quot;Damn dude that's huge,&quot; Jason joked, not believing any of it. He continued to stroke his now relatively average cock and watch the porn. A man had entered the scene to pleasure the girls; his cock was seemingly huge.<br />
&quot;I'm not joking. I'm bigger than him,&quot; Mark said truthfully, indicating the pornstar.<br />
Jason rotated his chair to face Mark full on but continued stroking his hardon, his mouth open and his eyes squinting from pleasure. &quot;Prove it,&quot; the jerker challenged.<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; While staying on his bed, Mark got to his knees and removed his shirt, not noticing that Jason was now masturbating to him stripping, taking in his decent pecs and abs. He pulled his pants down, then his straining boxers. Jason gasped as out flopped a gigantic cock pusling with veins, its thick base obscurred by a forest of pubes and a large pair testicles. It was only semierect but it was already bigger than Jason's, which was now rock hard. <br />
Jason ceased jerking his now insignificant cock as Mark's continued to swell. &quot;Dude you're a FUCKING BEAST. Look at the size of that meat missle.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nah, you're the beast,&quot; Mark replied. &quot;I'm the HULK.&quot; He smirked and flexed his massive penis, causing it to smack his abs. &quot;Now if you don't mind, HULK WANT TO JERK OFF HULK'S GIANT COCK.&quot; Mark stepped off his bed and pulled up a chair beside Jason to watch the porn. <br />
Up close the contrast was staggering. Mark's penis was a full three inches bigger and unbelievably thicker, while both of Jason's egg-sized balls were equal to one of Mark's. <br />
&quot;Does the Hulk want to jerk each other off?&quot; Jason offered.<br />
Mark grinned. &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
They reached out for the other, Mark's slightly thicker right arm passing under Jason's left. As Mark gripped Jason hard shaft, he gasped at the sheer girth. Despite being dominant in size now, Mark had only ever handled his regular 7&quot; dick. Before today, Jason's mammoth cock had been in an entirely different league of size. Jason was having an equal reaction to Mark's aptly self-described 'Hulk cock'. <br />
The roomates slowly began stroking, each not even able to fully wrap their hands around their partners shaft, especially in Jason's case. Mark's steel-hard beast was enormous and Jason was getting a workout caressing all eleven inches of it. Mark closed his eyes and moaned from the pleasure as Jason focused completely on Mark's giant fuck-stick. Neither was paying attention to the porn now.<br />
&quot;Aaaaawwww, don't stop,&quot; moaned Mark. &quot;That's it. Oh, I'm so fucking big. Got a fucking huge cock. Oooo. Damn, your cock feels big too. Fuck yeah. Pair of monster cocks right here. Oh, yeah. We'd make Shaq look like a baby dick. Oh, shit, gonna cum.&quot;<br />
As Mark tensed up and climaxed he squeezed hard on Jason's throbbing member causing him to shoot as well. While Jason's wad hit the wall and began to dribble, Mark shot clear to the ceiling and and the subsequently the wall and then Jason's desk. <br />
&quot;I think we're gonna be great roomates.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah.&quot;</p>
