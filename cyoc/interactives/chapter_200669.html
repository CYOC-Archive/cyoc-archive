<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel thought of his options quickly and moved past this mighty beast in the direction of the front door as silent as possible and as quickly as possible. <br />
When I reached the front door touching the door handle, I heard it, a low growl coming from this giant monster and the fear I felt was primal, I could not move a muscle in that moment.<br />
<br />
As the growl finished, I was sweating and very slowly turned around and then I felt it, the hot breath of the beast at the back of my head. I gulped and finished turning around slowly.<br />
<br />
“If I have to die today, at least I want to see it coming!”<br />
<br />
The beast looked at me with is bright amber eyes for a second while I remembered all the things in my life that happened. For a moment I thought <br />
“So it is right your life does flash…” <br />
<br />
Sluuuuuuuuuuurp<br />
<br />
What in the hell? <br />
This beast licked me with one lick from his legs up to my face and pushing me into the front door hard just with the force of his lick.<br />
<br />
And then just sat down in front of me. While I collected myself from this he just panted, looking at me.<br />
After this I had hope, maybe this was a wolf, but he saw me as a pack member? Maybe this wasn’t so bad?<br />
<br />
This thought was short lived as I saw the wolf doing something, it looked like a smirk, or at least the attempt of one, and he raised himself while using his tail to casually move the living room sofa out of the way… this strength was frightening to say the least.<br />
<br />
He then used his snout to push me, more or less gently, around in the room away from the door to the outside, in the direction of the kitchen. <br />
At this point I thought to myself to make a dash to the door in the cellar so that I take my luck with my mother in hopes she maybe was turning back soon, he was way to big to get there. <br />
<br />
As if he knew what I thought he made another growl that felt like a small earthquake in my body vibrating while his snout was on my back.<br />
<br />
I got the message and dropped this thought the very same second and stood still. He moved his head beside me and in the direction of the kitchen door and bit on a part of the wall and without any effort ripped out a big chunk of the wall making the kitchen door bigger, then again and again. <br />
When he was done showing me who was boss in this house he again seemed to grin and put his head in the hole he made.<br />
<br />
I didn’t dare to move one muscle while he was doing that mostly of simple fright of imagining what he would do with my bones. <br />
When his head reemerged, he had something in his mouth… the box of the cookies! <br />
<br />
He dropped the metal can gently on my feet and seemed to grin at me again, and I remembered what he said during the transformation.<br />
“Because she ate 2, he had more control”<br />
was he trying to eat more???<br />
<br />
And then I saw it, the metal can did have bite and scratch marks on it but way to small for the size of the wolf, the lion must have tried to open it, but then transformed back before he could finish it.<br />
<br />
He obviously wanted me to open the box for him, but that made no sense at all, he would have no problem at all to do that himself.... unless...<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to eat a cookie?&quot;<br />
<br />
He just pushed the box in front of me, as if to just urge me to open it already.<br />
“I don’t want to do th..” and he Growled again for 20 seconds straight while looking directly into my eyes. <br />
My body was working on his own after he finished. I just picked up the jar and pulled a cookie out and without thinking moved it in the direction of my mouth. <br />
But he would not have it, his tongue shot out his mouth pushing me back and the cookie glued on his sticky tongue while pulling it back. <br />
After I catched my breath from this sudden action, I thought to myself<br />
<br />
“Of course... you want even more control…”<br />
<br />
The box itself fell and the cookies spilling on the floor. I witnessed what more cookies do and scrambled to get the can and put the cookies back in <br />
At least that was my intention... the second he noticed me making a move he growled again, and I froze…<br />
<br />
He sniffed at the cookies but didn’t eat them… I was confused...  but then he seemed to undergo a change of some sort, he went stiff for a second and his eyes glowed.<br />
I thought of many things when seeing this, but I guessed what happened… the mind of these beast got even stronger.<br />
When his eyes went back to “normal” he just looked at me again for a second and I thought I saw him calculating something…<br />
<br />
His ears perked up and his head moving in the direction of the cellar door, as if he heard something and after a few seconds I could too… Very deep and aggressive sounds from the cellar and I took an educated guess my mother was slowly coming back again. Talk about shit timing…<br />
<br />
The wolf looked back at me again and then growled again, not at me but  as if annoyed. <br />
He moved his snout in between me and the now way bigger kitchen door and pushed me on the next wall and I got the message... “Don’t try anything!”<br />
<br />
I have absolutely no idea after this other cookie how long he’d be staying as a wolf until eventually my sister comes back… If I am so lucky not to have completely lost her now.<br />
<br />
The wolf growled and looked at me again for a second as if to say <br />
“Move and you’re dead meat!”<br />
<br />
After this he moved again into the direction of the spilled cookies but not eating them, no he seemed to count the cookies… he made 2 piles… one 3 cookies pile and one other cookies pile of 2… <br />
For me and my mother…<br />
<br />
And right now, there was no chance in hell I could not say no… and from the sounds coming from the cellar my mother was well on her way back… but it would not matter as long as this massive wolf was here, the very second she would see him, she would be on her way to beasthood again…<br />
<br />
The wolf himself seemed to be well aware of this, as he pushed the 3 cookies pile gently in my direction. <br />
When they where in front of me he lifted his head and showed his teeth clearly showing what he would do if I didn’t do the deed.<br />
<br />
Resigning to my fate I bent down and took the 3 cookies in my hand, but hesitating for a second or 2 before eating them, needless to say he didn’t like that and bared his teeth 15 inches from my face and growling again. <br />
<br />
To say I was scared shitless again was kinda a given and I quickly resigned to my fate and ate all 3 cookies at once. He just sat back on his haunches watching me.<br />
<br />
When I was done, he just laid down like any dog or wolf would and looked at me, as if waiting for something.<br />
<br />
My thoughts where circling in my head thinking over and over “don’t get scared, don’t get scared, for fucks sake don’t get scared….”<br />
<br />
And then I saw it… his tail was starting to… wag??? I lost my train of thought and suddenly he just barked…<br />
<br />
I jumped back, this fucker scared the shit out of me and then I just felt the pressure and the horniness I felt so often before, you know the feeling when you are in school, your mind drifts as a teenager and you think of something sexy and your dick swells in your pants… the tail of the wolf started to wag faster while he just waited…<br />
The feeling of my dick in my pants getting hard started to get uncomfortable and I didn’t know what to do…</p>
