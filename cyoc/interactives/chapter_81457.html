<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were about to follow Brad, whose name you just realised used to be George and must of been affected by his <br />
extreme progression, to decide whether to make him younger, when you saw a father and son arguing about <br />
something. The dad, called Devan, was 35 years old, a burly man with a trimmed goatee and his hair having the <br />
slightest touch of grey in it. The boy was called Paul, and was 10 years old, short and a bit scrawny. You <br />
decide to have some fun with them instead. You could always find Brad later, having complete and utter control <br />
over time and all. You stand nearby to listen in on their argument.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on dad, it's not that bad. I bet you did something like this when you were younger&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I never snuck into an R rated movie as a kid. I'm so disappointed in you. You're grounded for a month <br />
young man&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God that is so unfair! I wouldn't of snuck in if you actually went with me like you said you would. But <br />
no, you decided taking back that stupid suit was more important than spending time with your son&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't try and pin the blame on me. I said we'd go and see it another day, but you were the impatient one and <br />
disobeyed my orders&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;You always say another day. It was the first time in months that we even went somewhere together and you used <br />
it for your own selfish reasons again!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry that we don't spend more time together but I can't help having to spend so much time at work. <br />
You'll understand when you're older&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I understand now. You just don't remember what it's like to be a kid and not having your dad there when <br />
you need him most&quot;.<br />
<br />
While they got deeper into their argument, you decided to work your magic. You slammed your staff onto the <br />
floor and a ripple travelled through the crowd until it hit the two. The air around them started to vibrate, <br />
yet passer bys didn't seem to notice. But the father and son did. Their vision blurred and neither could talk <br />
to the other. They had no idea what was happening but they could feel themselves changing. Finally, the <br />
vibrating air started to dissipate. Devan was the first to appear. He was no longer 35, but rather 10. He had <br />
shrunk at least 2 feet in height, and was as scrawny as his son. He had reverted back through puberty, no body <br />
hair to his name. His groomed goatee was a thing of the past, or rather future, his chin as smooth as silk. <br />
His clothes had shrunk with him, becoming more child appropriate. He saw his tiny body and screamed loudly, <br />
his voice sounded like it was on helium compared to the smooth baritone he had moments before. He felt his <br />
face, now round and chubby with youth. He looked towards his son who was starting to appear from behind the <br />
vibrating air. It quickly became apparent that Paul wasn't a kid any more. He was now a 35 year old man, <br />
standing well over 6ft in height. He was just as burly as his dad once was, his upper body was impressively <br />
muscular, yet his stomach was solid and was starting to bulge out some. He had a dense stubble coating his <br />
cheeks and a thick, wide circle beard surrounding his lips, stretching a few inches off his chin with a <br />
mixture of grey and black hairs. He had a touch of grey at his temples. His clothes had also changed to fit <br />
him, now wearing a tight white vest, showing off the thick hair that coated his body like an under-shirt. His <br />
bare arms were like bear arms, meaty and coated with hair. Paul looked down to see his much beefier body and <br />
yelled in a deep gravelly voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, I'm so big! What happened?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, I think we actually switched lives or something!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Paul was excited. He lifted up his vest to see his extremely hairy belly. &quot;Wow, I have hair everywhere. This <br />
is so cool! We're definitely going home now&quot;.<br />
<br />
Devan was less excited &quot;No, we're not leaving until we get this fixed. I don't want to be a kid again. How <br />
will I get back to work looking like this? They wouldn't even let me in through the doors&quot;.<br />
<br />
Paul ran a hand down his long goatee and replied &quot;No, we're staying this way. I'm the adult now and you have <br />
to do what I say&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you can't stay as an adult. You don't even have a driver's license, how would we get home?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Paul dug through his tight jeans and found a wallet. Inside was a driver's license showing a younger him with <br />
a shorter beard and no grey hair, along with his work ID, credit cards and other things all in his name. He <br />
showed them to his dad saying &quot;It looks like reality has changed so I'm your dad. Therefore, I so do totally <br />
know how to drive now, and we're going home&quot;. <br />
<br />
He started pulling on the boy's arm to get him to move, but Devan managed to stand his ground. &quot;This can't be <br />
happening! People are going to notice things are different&quot;.<br />
<br />
Paul laughed and said &quot;Yeah, but who's ever going to believe we switched ages? You're just a little kid now. <br />
They'll just say you have an active imagination. No, they're going to believe the big, hairy man with the <br />
beard, and that's me&quot;. Paul tugged on his &quot;son's&quot; arm again, but Devan stayed put. Peter let out a rough growl <br />
and said &quot;Stop holding us up and come along. You're just going to have to accept that I'm the dad and you're <br />
my son now&quot;.<br />
<br />
You decide to help Paul out a little. You stomp the staff on the floor again and watch as Devan shrunk <br />
further, getting slightly chubbier as he youthened to 5 years old. Meanwhile, Paul put on more weight, his <br />
stomach swelling out until it hung over his jeans, making an impressive beer belly. His upper body lost its <br />
definition and sagged some. His circle beard grew slightly longer, all the hair below the mouth was now <br />
completely grey, verging on white. His hair rapidly thinned, leaving a steep M shaped hairline and a large <br />
bald spot on the back of his scalp. His face got rounder as a double chin appeared slightly hidden by his <br />
beard, and lines started to spread out around his eyes and mouth. He'd now reached 40 years old. They were <br />
both stunned again, but then Peter saw his opportunity and picked the smaller boy up with no effort at all. He <br />
held a struggling Devan at face level, the kid's feet practically standing on his prominent belly, and broke <br />
into a smile. &quot;Looks like I'm older than you ever were now&quot;.<br />
<br />
Devan was scared of the older man's grin, his face creased more than it should. But maybe he could convince <br />
him to stay at the mall to try and fix things. &quot;Yeah, you definitely look it. So old. Your beard is white and <br />
your hair is missing. You even look fatter than your uncle Kyle. Do you really want to be some balding, <br />
greying, fat man?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Peter ran his fingers through his thinning hair with strange glee and said &quot;Yup. I may be middle aged now, but <br />
it's better than being some dumb kid. Besides, there's still some muscle under all this fat. And I don't care <br />
about losing my hair. I can just shave it off. Grey hair just makes you more distinguished. Therefore, we're <br />
leaving now before you end up a baby. It could happen, and you wouldn't want that would you? I mean I don't <br />
mind getting a bit older, but can you face the prospect of having an adult mind in a baby's body, not being <br />
able to talk or walk?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Devan found the hypothetical prospect terrifying, and realised that there was no way he'd be able to get out <br />
of this. He hung his head down and whispered &quot;I don't... Fine, just take us home Peter.&quot; The man gave him a <br />
cold stare until Devan added &quot;I mean dad...&quot;. Peter grinned and threw the boy onto his shoulders where Devan <br />
could see the extent of his hair loss, and feel the man's hirsuteness on his hairless legs. Peter then carried <br />
him out of the mall, his belly jiggling with every step. To the normal bystander, they'd see a typical father <br />
and son bonding over their mall time, yet you knew the truth. You followed them out, wondering whether there <br />
was more you could do to them. Maybe change their memories or swap even more years.</p>
