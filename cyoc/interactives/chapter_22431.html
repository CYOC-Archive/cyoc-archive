<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A young man strolls into the store, Nick never had seen it before, his computer busted he needed something to do, maybe he could convince his friends to play a game from this rustic shop. <br />
<br />
With dark brown hair and olive eyes, Nick stands at 6 feet, with a toned agile frame and a silver loop in each earlobe. He wears a green and white striped button-up longsleeve with the arms rolled up and tan casual slacks. Easy-going, Nick maintains a relatively placid outward appearance, though behind that lies excessive energy and exuberance, often saved for private usage.<br />
<br />
The Old Man brightens as he spies Nix browsing the entryway racks of simple card games. &quot;Greetings son, welcome to my store! Looking for something out of the ordinary?&quot; <br />
<br />
Nick nods politely and smiles to the Old Man. &quot;Just a little bored I guess, no raids tonight for me, computer is gonna be running through virus scans for ages. So you sell games?&quot; <br />
<br />
The Old Man smiles and nods, &quot;Very special games! Not as flashy on the outside as a computer game, but the... technology on the programming is just as superior. Here, this is my pride and joy,&quot; He draws out an old wooden box, and opens it, revealing another box labeled the Game of Change. &quot;The Game of Change! Only 9.95 for today! I guarantee it will entertain you and all the players, or I'll pay you DOUBLE what you pay the next day, provided you finish the game. To judge it fairly I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick smirks. This is too easy, a game that might or might not be fun, it'll definitely beat the boredom, and hey, he could GAIN money by bringing it back. Definitely a win win win situation.<br />
<br />
An hour later, Nick has some goodies strewn about the living room, his roommates out of the room partying as his players arrive. First, Meghan. The eldest of the group at 23, Meghan met Nick over the game Everquest, a medium height woman with a well kept body. Her hair always a different color, but never too wild, the day of the game she keeps it at a brown and rust red highlight mix, wearing a black blouse and jeans. She came to Nick's campus and found out two old school acquaintances also went, Emily and Ben. She is a crazy young woman, with a bit of a temper but also a very sweet and caring nature for the general part, and absolutely adores Nick, they are truly inseperable.<br />
<br />
Right behind Meghan is Emily. Emily is a true goth, or at least more true to the origins then a standard emo. Wearing an old victorian robe with some lace over her shoulders and belly, she has a slim pale body, her hair is tucked back into a teased cascade behind her head, dyed a bluish black, while she doesn't wear much makeup. Her dress extends down her arms, a loop around her middle finger, and long wings extending about a foot down from her elbows, on her legs are thigh high boots with buckles all the way up. She is quiet but also a very good friend of Meghan, since she was very nice to her in high school. <br />
<br />
Laughter precedes the entrance of Ben, laughing at his own jokes to no one in particular. One of the varsity football players a year after Meghan's, Ben is a blonde hair with slightly longer ragged hair, well defined muscles. He wears a tight muscle shirt and camo slacks, thinks he's a big tough guy. An ex boyfriend of Meghan, he despises her for dumping him when he was too forward for her in highschool, his attempts at fazing her afterwards having nasty aftershocks to his ego and rep, while Meghan continued to be very polite to him. He also knows Emily, having beat up her old boyfriend at the senior party, a stoner named Michael who shot himself 2 days after graduation.<br />
<br />
One of Nick's neighbors in their apartment, Jaime strolls in, smiling in turn to all of the others, having met them before. Jaime is close to 6 feet tall, with blue eyes and red-orange hair growing down past her shoulders. Unlike Richard, she has a large amount of confidence and pride - She's intelligent and industrious, taking what she does seriously. Its definitely apparent she's going to go places in life. wears a black-and-white-striped button-up long-sleeve shirt and a knee length black skirt, black heels<br />
<br />
Nick waits about 5 minutes as the others chat and find comfortable spots around the room, Nick and Meghan sitting on the couch around the table as Emily sits down upon the floor, Jaime pulling up one of the dining room chairs. Ben wastes no time in sitting on the other side of Jaime, sneaking a glance down her body but hiding it well as he looks to Nick. Of whom, is wondering where their last guest is. <br />
<br />
Finally, Richard arrives, peeking in the door as if uninvited. &quot;C'mon Rich, come on in, we were afraid you weren't coming.&quot; Brimming with potential - however that may never show up with Richard, as lazy as he can be. dark blue long sleeve shirt on blue jeans, grey shoes -- a bland nothing-special look for RichardRichard is about 5'8 tall with dark brown hair and eyes to match. He has a very skinny build. He is severely lacking in confidence and very shy, so much so he can't even look people in the eyes. Behind his uncertainty is a smart individual <br />
<br />
Richard pulls up a seat on the lazyboy next to the table, dragging it across the room to the gameboard Nick has set up. <br />
<br />
Emily smirks, musing, &quot;Reminds me of that Robin Williams movie, Jumanji.&quot; Meghan laughs &quot;It does resemble it, slightly. Looks like we get cards though.&quot; <br />
<br />
The board is a deep maroon brown. There are comparments in the sides, open dishes with a die, a small tattered rulebook, and stick figurines, oddly, 3 women and 3 men. How lucky. The figurines look super bland at the moment, Nick stops Ben from picking up the rulebook. &quot;I thumbed through. Apparently we play cards which the center screen will deal in our direction,&quot; He gestures to a slit that encompasses the entire circular display. &quot;We use this cards on one another to hinder their progress or something, says its vital to the gameplay, and the space we land on tells us what to play or who to play it on, and the display will explain whatever the card means. I'm guessing like 'move back three' or 'go directly to jail'&quot; Nick chuckles, getting a few smirks. <br />
<br />
Jaime picks up the first piece, all of them seeming to be pewter silver she sets it on the start. As she does, a green spark seems to travel up her finger. She yelps in pain, then looks at the figure. &quot;Whoa...&quot; Her figurine now shows her body, her hairstyle and clothes the same, except colorless, even the tiny face resembles hers. <br />
<br />
Nick is amazed &quot;So this is what he meant by unrivaled programming.&quot; Richard looks nervous, &quot;This game has been tested right?&quot; &quot;Oh don't be such a sissy, I am sure it will just give us cancer.&quot; Meghan laughs politely, as the others just smirk again. &quot;Come on, let's roll. Who is going first?&quot; <br />
<br />
As the others prepare their pieces at the start, eying the branching littered pathways, down to the triumphant END square, the display suddenly shimmers, blue words seem to hover in mid air, visible from any angle. **The player with the first name initial closest to M rolls first** <br />
<br />
Meghan holds the die to Nick. &quot;That's you bucko, roll that bone!&quot; <br />
<br />
Nick rolls the dice, at the same time the display perfectly deals 6 cards to each player. Apparently there are 4 suits of cards, all 'randomized each game' so no game is ever alike, but the suits remain. Labeled in his hand he sees one of each, a libido card, crimson red, a physical card with a golden sheen, while the environment card in his hand holds a green tone, and the blue in his hand hides his mental card. Each has writing, some with pictures. <br />
<br />
The dice lands on a 4. He reaches to move his piece but lets out a chuckle as it strolls ahead on it's own, sliding ahead 4 spaces to a space adorned with a 1. &quot;Hm, one card, on...&quot; **Play your first card, upon the love of your life&quot; &quot;Well, Meghan. You're up. I have to play on you.&quot; Meghan smiles &quot;Do your worst, fiend.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nick places a golden card down on the space in front of Meghan. It is labeled Wardrobe. Meghan glances to the display as it fades into a little rhyme...<br />
<br />
********<br />
To start this game, <br />
    You Rolled a four,<br />
The magic wherein is far from tame,<br />
    We know you'll be asking for more.<br />
********<br />
<br />
Meghan shakes her head, snickering. &quot;Magic, ya know as much as I'd love to believe this game is magic, I have to play the skeptic and point out you may be taking this back a lot sooner then you thought, Nick.&quot; As she talks however, the others can only stare in amazement as her conservative, yet attractive clothes worm about on her body, she seems unnoticing, her blouse shrinks and tightens, forming a halter top like attire with a spaghetti strap around her neck, a plunging diamond cut out neckline that goes to her naval, ending just above the end of the shirt, and no back, so tight it highly accentuates her bosom. Her jeans have become a miniskirt so short, if she hadn't had her legs crossed, you could have seen she no longer is wearing any panties. <br />
<br />
The bulge from little Nick reminds him of the card, as he wishes the card would have done more, or left less. Meghan however seems oblivious, evne Ben, whom has trouble containing his wandering eye upon her, &quot;Um Meghan, your clothes?&quot; &quot;What about them? So what if I felt like dressing up differently today?&quot; Meghan chimes back. Ben opens his mouth &quot;Yeah like a s---&quot; He stops, looking to the game, he shakes his head. &quot;No way...&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Meghan picks up the dice, hmmm... next in the alphabet would be... Richard! Your turn! She holds the dice out to him, as she leans across the board her well-gifted cleavage exposed slightly.</p>
