<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the events of the night faded, the dream with Chel, the new reality that he woke up to... all of it was odd. All of it was intriguing and interesting, making him wonder about the truth of everything. The words that Chel spoke, the ones about not spoiling Eli&#39;s secret, but telling him that Alex would want to stay with him... that also intrigued him. What was it about Eli that made him so special, so interesting, so much of a mystery that begged to be explored? Alex was determined now, more than ever, to find out for himself, and Chel, who watched in the shadows, couldn&#39;t have been happier about it. The thing about Chel... he wanted creatures to be themselves... to let who and what they are free and even though what he knew about Eli wasn&#39;t good for the rest, it was good for Eli. Eli chose to live in the forest like he did, but it wasn&#39;t about him being true to what and who he was... rather it was keeping him from being his true self.<br />
<br />
With the monster cock pressed between the cleft of his ass cheeks, Alex grinned, feeling a bit more open... definitely a bit more randy. Thoughts and images of him having his bowels stuffed by Eli started filling his mind, but it wasn&#39;t the Eli whom he knew at the moment... rather it was Eli in his true form, but that form was veiled by a dark shadow that completely obscured the true beast within. Not wanting to wait any longer, with a bit of a grunt, Alex moved, rotating in place and looked directly at the being Eli showed himself as. Alex smiled warmly, studying the features of the male, as he started to notice things about Eli that hadn&#39;t been visible before. As close as he was to Eli, Alex noticed that Eli&#39;s ears came to slightly pointed tips and his mouth seemed to be a bit puffier. Curious, Alex carefully and gently placed a finger against Eli&#39;s lips and pushed up on the slightly moist flesh, breaking the seal and exposing his teeth. With a grin, Alex noticed that Eli&#39;s upper and lower bicuspids were sharper and more predatory than he originally noticed.<br />
<br />
Removing his finger having revealed what Alex was curious about, he just laid there and pondered about the truth about Eli, wondering what he was exactly and why he was working so damed hard to keep it a secret. Alex wondered whose benefit it had been for. There was no doubt in Alex&#39;s mind that it was for everyone else other than Eli, which actually bothered Alex having been in this world for a period of time. Everyone there was free to be themselves. Werewolves there were both good and reserved beings, being what they are among their own kind, as he had observed. Other werewolves were dark and evil, wanting to spread, corrupt and make as many as they could into what they were. Alex couldn&#39;t help but to wonder if Eli was a truly evil werewolf hiding from it because someone or something told him it was bad. However, as Alex stared at Eli, Eli started to stir as his eyes began to split apart and Alex&#39;s smiling face was inches away from his own.<br />
<br />
Eli smiled and reached out for Alex, pulling him inward, pressing their bodies firmly yet gently together for what was a morning cuddle type hug. &quot;Mmmm... morning Alex.&quot; Eli said softly, &quot;And what do I owe the pleasure of you studying me this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... um... well...&quot; Alex said with a bit of a blush, placing his free hand behind his head, smiling and trying to come up with an answer to being out the beast in Eli instead of making him pull back. &quot;Honestly... I noticed that you were starting to show what you really are while you were asleep... as if you completely let your guard down and what you are was free to show itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli&#39;s eyes darted open, he scrambled a bit to try and get away from Alex, but Alex was quick to grasp onto Eli firmly and keep him right where he was. &quot;No! Let me go! You don&#39;t know what you are doing! You aren&#39;t from this world... you don&#39;t understand what would happen if you awoke the real me!&quot; Eli said as he struggled against Alex&#39;s grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right... I don&#39;t know what I am doing. I might just be a dumb human in a world I really don&#39;t understand, but the one thing that I have always known is that not being true to who and what you are has huge consequences. When you&#39;ve been awake, I can see the anguish in your eyes. The utter sadness your body language gives away. It is as if you truly want to be what you are, but you are making a massive conscious effort against it. However, when you were asleep and I was able to see it... you were starting to show what you are and you were at peace. You looked so happy and so I wanted to study that new side of you that I had yet to see.&quot; Alex said, keeping his face close to Eli&#39;s, seeing the features remain in place, which made him smile internally.<br />
<br />
Without even thinking about it, Alex pulled Eli in strongly, their faces now centimeters apart, close enough for them to touch... to embrace in wild passion. &quot;You... you won&#39;t like the real me!&quot; Eli protested.<br />
<br />
Alex just smiled, feeling Eli&#39;s resistance waning, as if the real Eli inside was wanting this and was eager for Alex to be the key to unlock that door and let the real Eli out. &quot;How exactly do you know that? We only met a little while ago. How do you know if what I really like is to see the evil beasts have their way with the world?&quot; Alex said with a telling grin as he roughly grasped the somewhat flaccid cock that rested against his own and explored his pubic forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;B... but I am a monster!&quot; Eli protested verbally, though his body didn&#39;t struggle anymore... a clear sign that the walls and barriers Eli put up for himself were tumbling down like the Berlin Wall of Alex&#39;s world.<br />
<br />
&quot;So?! Who cares if you&#39;re a monster?! Be the monster Eli! Be who you are! Be what you are! Want to go on a killing rampage in your beastial or non-beastial form, I say go for it! Want to rape and pillage and plunder, taking what you wanted, making who and what you wanted yours? Go for it. The god Meljin made you beastly men what you are for a reason and clearly doesn&#39;t care what you do... so why not embrace that side of you... hmm?&quot; Alex said, swirling a finger deftly around Eli&#39;s perking nipple, feeling the cock attached to Eli&#39;s body getting firmer, pressing into and against Alex&#39;s pubic region. &quot;Yeah... that&#39;s it... I can tell you want this... just let yourself go!&quot; Alex said with a cheerful smile, taking the freehand that he had and grasped the firming cock, making Eli jump slightly as he was startled by the forwardness of the human before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y... yeah? Y-you think I should be the real me...?&quot; Eli said, still unsure of himself and what he should do. He couldn&#39;t help but to admit just how good it was feeling to let go... even just this little bit. He could feel the beast within excited and it drove his mind to crack just a bit more as his cock firmed up more in Alex&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I do!&quot; Alex said with a grin as he pumped the cock in his hand a single time, coaxing what was locked away in Eli out a bit more, noticing his ears taking on a more hybrid form between something lupine and human as the once completely human teeth started to look sharper and slightly longer as Eli smiled openly for the first time since the two had paired up.<br />
<br />
Eli moaned a little, his lower half reflexively bucked into Alex&#39;s hand that was wrapped along his cock. &quot;Fuck... this does feel good!&quot; He said as he moaned again while the beast was winning. &quot;You really want to see the real me... seriously? Fine...&quot; He said with an evil and sinister looking smile. &quot;You&#39;ll get what you want and for your reward... I will make you like me, but you need to go get me a human that&#39;s not so willing. I want you to get another human that hates beastmen and bring him right here. I will wait for you, right here Alex, and then you&#39;ll see the real me!&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Having wasted no time at all, glad to have taken down the barriers Eli had put up to finally reveal the truer version of Eli, Alex had put all of his clothes back on and ran to the nearby road to see if there were any people on the road. He wanted to see the real Eli and Alex could tell that the real Eli was definitely emerging. As he stood there on the side of the road what looked like another human could be seen off in the distance and Alex waved to the stranger. As the stranger in the distance saw Alex waving to him, the man ran toward Alex, faster and faster until he was nearly there and slowed to a brisk walk and then stopped, grabbing Alex&#39;s arm and forced it down beside his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing? Are you out of your mind?! Beastmen roam these parts and it is even said that a terrible monster lurks these woods. Don&#39;t you know that there are numerous beastmen around that could look human?!&quot; He said, making Alex think a bit about what he was doing and wondering if the &#39;terrible monster&#39; was Eli.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... yeah... sorry... I was just traveling alone and we humans have to stick together... right?&quot; Alex said, playing off his true intent. &quot;You are a human... right? Can&#39;t stand those nasty beastmen... always being uncivil and rutting everywhere or making others into them. We humans have to travel in numbers in order to be safe.&quot; Alex added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I know exactly what you mean. My  group  got overrun by boarmen and I was lucky enough to escape unchanged by them.&quot; He said, &quot;Name is Aaron... and you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I am Alex! Nice to meet you Aaron. You said you were attacked by boarmen? I have never encountered them before, mostly werewolves live near where I am from.&quot; He said, playing the field.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... nasty brutes those boarmen are... dirty, digusting, burly, hairy creatures...&quot; Aaron said as Alex heard his tone change as he recalled them, noticing Aaron getting a bit chubby as well. Perhaps he is truly unwilling, but something about him spoke to Alex and said he would make a great beasty companion once changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...? How about you come back to my camp with me? I just made my morning meal and I am afraid I made too much of it... definitely don&#39;t want to let it go to waste.&quot; Alex said, trying to reign the man in. &quot;You could tell me more about the boarmen you narrowly escaped from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehh... I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s hard to trust others now adays, but I am famished since I wasn&#39;t able to have breakfast myself. What the hell... we humans have to stick together, right?!&quot; Aaron said, smiling innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely! Camp is a bit back here in the woods. Definitely want to make sure a guy is protected from all sides... you know? The road is a dangerous place when traveling or not.&quot; Alex said with a wry grin, his back to Aaron who was unable to see that Alex was up to no good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... so how long have you been on your own on the road and where did you say you were from?&quot; Aaron asked as Alex led him back to the camp where Eli was waiting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me... I have been on my own for a few days now. My home got over-run by werewolves and I just couldn&#39;t stay there any longer. Definitely didn&#39;t want to be one of them.&quot; Alex said lying, always having enjoyed the idea of being a werewolf when he was in his original home reality. &quot;So... tell me about the boarmen... what&#39;s disgusting about them?&quot; Alex asked as he brought Aaron closer to Eli.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are just disgusting brutes...&quot; He said, but his tone said otherwise and Alex knew something had wiggled it&#39;s way into Aaron&#39;s mind. &quot;They fuck, piss, and shit right where they live. They roll around in it. They are just overall disgusting creatures!&quot; He said with more of a reaffirmed position, which told Alex that Aaron liked brutish men, but just not boarmen.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... are there any beastmen you&#39;ve had good encounters with?&quot; Alex asked as he could see the camp in the distance, yet Eli was out of sight for the time being.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... not at all. None of them have any sort of decorum that fits well with humans. I simply stay far, far away from the beasts if I can!&quot; Aaron said as he too could see the camp up ahead. &quot;This where you camped? Looks like it was set up for another fella...&quot; He said with an apprehensive tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yeah... it was originally me and my friend Eli traveling together, but he&#39;s gone now. Taken...&quot; Alex lied as he saw Eli walk up behind Aaron as Alex had turned around.<br />
<br />
A low, menacing and sinister growl came from where Eli stood, his mouth directly in Aaron&#39;s ear and a smile adorned his face with his fang-like teeth completely visible. &quot;You did well Alex... my companion... to bring me THIS one! The one who got away from me when I first started the work I was meant to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron froze in place. A look of shock, dread and fear rose in him, but prevented him from moving anything outside of his mouth. &quot;... you!&quot; He claimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... me Aaron. Did you think you&#39;d be able to keep yourself from me indefinitely?&quot; Eli said, trailing his fingers around Aaron&#39;s collarbone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I didn&#39;t know if I would be able to, but to think you have a human doing your dirty work Eli!&quot; Aaron exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly... if it wasn&#39;t for him bringing out the beast in me... the one I worked so hard to repress for so long... he probably wouldn&#39;t have happened across you and brought you here for our little reunion.&quot; Eli said, then looked to Alex. &quot;You see Alex... I am the original monster... the first werewolf Alpha and I was the one to create the true werewolves... the ones you know as Dark Werewolves and Aaron here was to be my first Beta. He was submissive to me. He actually wanted to be the beast, but something in him changed... something made him hate werewolves and other beastmen. Now that you brought him to me... look at how he has changed already... you can see it in his body, can&#39;t you? You can see how he wants others to submit themselves to him, as you have submitted yourself to me.&quot; Eli said as his body started to shift, as thick, brutish, powerful muscle slipped onto his frame and dark, chocolate brown hair developed all over his body. &quot;Oooh... this fuckin feels amazing! I forgot just how good this feels!&quot; He said with a sinister moan, wiping his pre from his saturated cockhead, coating his whole hand in the stringy, clear goo.<br />
<br />
Alex and Aaron both looked at it. He could see just how Aaron truly craved it like he did. Eli moved his now claw tipped fingers as they both followed it with hungry eyes. &quot;Fuck Eli...&quot; Aaron moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... just being in my presence reminds you just how much you wanted pups to submit themselves to you... isn&#39;t that right Aaron?&quot; Eli moaned as he brought the fluid closer to Aaron to taste.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I can&#39;t... I can&#39;t fight it...&quot; He said with a bit of a struggle. &quot;I tried to for so long... tried to keep myself from getting anywhere near you to keep myself from wanting exactly what you just said, but now... fuck it! I wanna feed this hungry pup with my powerful werewolf cum that you will bless me with!&quot; Aaron said moaning, grasping the thick muscled and now fur covered forearm of Eli. &quot;You are THE Dark Werewolf God!&quot; He moaned as he pulled the goo covered fingers to his mouth and suckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... that&#39;s it, submit to me and you will feed this pup... just like I will! We will feed him together, filling his mouth with our werewolf cum, making him the slut for cum that I know you can see within him!&quot; Eli cheered on as Aaron latched onto his soaked fingers, feeling his tongue cleaning the fur, already changing to become more pliable and able to better serve his alpha.</p>
