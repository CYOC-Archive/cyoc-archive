<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Searching for &quot;body swapping medallions,&quot; it wasn&#39;t long before Anthony came across an acient, mythic medallion called The Medallion of Zulu. He clicked the headline, and was greeted with a photo of his medallion! He began reading, and it contained instructions and rules, and this was the gist of it:<br />
<br />
If a person is touching the medallion when they touch another person or living thing, they will switch bodies near instantaneously. <br />
<br />
The body switch will last for 12 hours. In that time period, neither of the two individuals involved in the switch, will be able to switch again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. So I&#39;m stuck like this at least for tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once the 12 hours are over, the two parties have 12 hours to switch back. Once the time runs out before they do, they shall be stuck in their respective new positions permanently. They may only switch back with eachother in this time period, and not with anyone or anything else. <br />
<br />
Seeing the word &quot;permanent&quot; made his stomach drop. He tried igoring that part. <br />
<br />
The final rule, is that only the possessor of the medallion upon the switch will know what happened. The other party will continue living their new life as if nothing happened. They will have all the memories and personality of the person or thing they switched with. The only person that will ever be aware of the switch, is the possessor . <br />
<br />
&quot;So, that explains that, then. Why Charlie was acting like me. It&#39;s because, as far he knows, he IS me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He went to grab his sweatpants to take the medallion out and examine it. Except, it was empty, save for that cheap wallet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Anthony said. He frantically checked both pockets several times. Trying to keep his panic under control,he thought about emwhere it might be. It could be in Vin&#39;s SUV. It could be.....at the theater.....<br />
<br />
He went to look up the theater number, and dialed. It was closed! The only other alternative at the moment to search for the thing, was Vin&#39;s vehicle. &quot;Maybe it fell out of my pocket there?&quot;<br />
<br />
He noticed he thought of it as his own pocket, and not the real Charlie&#39;s!<br />
<br />
&quot;But how do I search his vehicle? He lives across town, several miles away. I can&#39;t walk there. Not at this time of night....or....could I? But then again, when I get there, I wouldn&#39;t be able to get into the damn thing. Not without the keys. I could just the windows in. I wouldn&#39;t want to do that to his expensive vehicle. But then again, I REALLY don&#39;t want to be stuck as my kid&#39;s best friend! Especially if I&#39;m going to be gay as him! &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That settled it! I&#39;ll have to just go over to Vin&#39;s and just break into his garage and then his truck. I can&#39;t recruit anyone to help me out. Not even Gino, probably. Certainly not Charlie while I my body. No way anyone would believe me. Charlie has my own brain, according to the website. So he&#39;d deny it and think I&#39;m a weirdo. I&#39;ll just have to do it myself. &quot;<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t appear to Anthony that anyone else lived with him. Not even parents. But then again, how the hell is he paying bills and living in a house? <br />
<br />
&quot;Nevermind that. I&#39;ll just have to check up on the kid more closely when we go back to normal. But first thing&#39;s first. I have GOT to get back to normal!&quot; <br />
<br />
Vin&#39;s place was a good 5 miles distance from Charlie&#39;s house. It would take at least two hours to walk there! Anthony knew he had a bike, but he thought it was left at his house when they went to the theater. He usually rides it over to the house when he hangs out with Gino. But then, Vin dropped him off at Charlie&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Anthony decided to check the rest of the property real quick, in case there is a bike hiding out somewhere. He was in luck: there was a bike on the back porch  Unfortunately, it was a small bike. But then again, he&#39;s now got a much smaller body. It&#39;ll have to do. At least for a little while. He may have to abandon it along the way at some point, if need be. But at least I&#39;ll carry him for a little distance quicker than walking would.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn. This sucks, not having a car!&quot; he thought to himself. <br />
<br />
He decided to continue scoping out the house a bit longer. You never know what you might come across that could come in handy. And besides, it kills a little bit of time. Hopefully, enough for Vin to go to bed and go to sleep. Anthony knew his twin very well. He&#39;s a total night owl. He usually doesn&#39;t go to bed until 2 or 3 in the morning, and it&#39;s only a little after 10 now. Even if he had to walk the five miles to get to Vin&#39;s place, it should only take about an hour and a half or so. So he has a couple of hours to burn. <br />
<br />
&quot;A couple of hours. Ugh. I gotta hang out as a 14 year old boy for a couple of more hours before I can even take any action.&quot; Anthony sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Might as well check out the rest of this dump,&quot; he thought. <br />
<br />
He decided to start with the living room and kitchen. That&#39;s where he first walked into the place. He found a living room lamp, and turned it on. Irritation and a little bit of disgust followed. There were used dishes, and a couple of can&#39;s of Spaghettios sitting on a side table. The carpet was a thick, dark maroon color. The couch was brown, and there was a brown and a bright red recliner. The couch had a couple of blankets and pillows just thrown on it haphazardly. Fake wood paneling covered the one wall behind the couch, with two short, but wide basement-like windows on that same wall, and a dart board between the windows. It was outdated by at least 39 years. Definitely 80s-style. The interior decoration was at least as old as he was. Well, as old as he used to be. &quot;Twice as old as I am now.&quot; That thought hit I&#39;m on the pit of the stomach, but he felt his penis begin to rise. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wtf. I&#39;m in the body of a god damn horny teenager!&quot; It got harder. He looked down and had to grip himself through the shorts he was wearing. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is ridiculous!&quot; He forced himself to let go, and continue about his business. At least there was a smart TV in the living room, with a digital box attached. <br />
<br />
Anthony then wandered towards the kitchen, and flipped on the kitchen light, which was a long recessed bar over the countertop that separated the living room from the kitchen. It wasn&#39;t a whole lot to speak of. Even worse, was the pile of dirty dishes in the sink, a pan with leftover beans or something still sitting on the stovetop. A whole pile of papers, mostly bills and whatnot, scattered over the bar. The floor was also dirty. <br />
<br />
Anthony opened the fridge. Nothing but a bottle of old milk, ketchup, and couple of bottles of salad dressings, half or a quarter full. Something sticky was spilled on the bottom of the fridge. He closed the fridge. Then he ransacked the cupboards. Hoards of canned goods. Mostly Spaghettios, but also several different types of soups.<br />
<br />
&quot;No wonder that boy is so thin.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked down at himself after saying that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Or rather, no wonder I&#39;M so thin... At least I&#39;m not a skeleton, and have at least a little more than just skin and bones.&quot;<br />
<br />
His next thought was:<br />
<br />
&quot;This body really survives off of this crap whenever he doesn&#39;t eat at my place? No wonder he comes over a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ant felt a little sad and heartbroken about that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where are th is kid&#39;s parents anyway? It&#39;s after 10, and I&#39;m a 14 year old kid home alone. I never let Gino stay by himself like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anthony turned around to look at the empty, yet messy house. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; He called out to nobody. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, this is lonely. Wtf?&quot;<br />
<br />
Starting to feel depressed, Anthony decided to turn on the TV to pass the time.</p>
