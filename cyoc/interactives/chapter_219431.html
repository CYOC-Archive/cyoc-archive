<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sunlight filtered through the trees, illuminating Teri’s pale body as the heat made the tentacles around her wriggle, causing her to wake up giggling.<br />
<br />
“Stop that, you’re tickling me!” she playfully said, scooting herself near a tree and leaning against it. The tentacles still moved across her like a blanket, searching for nourishment, but she had already spent most of yesterday feeding them. She loved them, of course, but she didn’t want to devote her life to being a broodmother  just yet!<br />
<br />
“Maybe the book has something that can help…” she mused, picking it up and trying to read it again. <br />
<br />
“Ygiinah n’athflghltha, wagh’nagl ft’aghn…”<br />
<br />
As she spoke out loud, a pleasurable haze came over her mind. She continued reading, her voice reduced to whisper, only semi aware of the changes that were occurring as she went deeper and deeper into the book. Her skin, starting from the tentacles on her back, began coloring itself a light vibrant purple, the hue marching over her shoulders and down her arms, spiraling like the appendages it originated from. The tips of her tentacles became a dark purple, almost black, as they spewed a thin pink mist around her. The tentacles that had covered her began sliding off, affected by the mist like a pheromone as the altered color of her skin shifted across her breasts, turning the areolae a dark purple the same as the ends of her tentacles, and further down to her thin midriff and crotch. It danced across her nethers, staining its lips the same dark shade as before as it invaded inwards, causing Teri to moan slightly and shift upwards, but it didn’t prevent her from reading. The more she read, the more she understood.<br />
<br />
The book is the holy book of who was once a High Priestess, the leader of a cultist that worshipped a demon queen known as Adagia the Depraved. It held the secrets to becoming a vessel of Adagia’s power, a receptacle to her soul. It seeded the host, its trial of mothering the tentacles a test to ensure strength and survivability, and then it molded the body to properly receive the power that the newly birthed children of Adagia now held, born by demonic energy and nourished by a human’s life force. <br />
<br />
As the purple skin slowly made its way up Teri’s collarbone, she could feel it trekking centimeter by centimeter. Truth be told, she was kind of scared of this, but at the same time, the corruption was already influencing her.<br />
<br />
And besides, who else could look after all these children?<br />
<br />
She knew what she must do. As she finished the last page of the book, it losing the last of its power, she tossed it aside and came to terms with her decision. Hitching a breath, she traced a lithe purple finger down the side of her equally hued body, stopping just before the bead of her clit.<br />
<br />
“Alright, little ones…you know what to do. I accept you, I accept all of you. Make me your queen!”<br />
<br />
The tentacles already on her back responded by spraying a darker mist, the fine droplets settling upon the tentacles gathered around her and driving them into a frenzy. They knew their purpose, and they were more than happy to fulfill it. One by one they crawled up to Teri, who drew her legs up and then outwards, exposing her sex for all to see. Tenderly she reached down, and then pulled her lips open, shuddering from the feeling of her perfect fingertips. The first tentacle lined itself up carefully before crawling inside, causing Teri’s chest to further rise with breath as she shivered from the feeling. The feeling of the tentacle burrowing inside, dissolving, adding itself to her. One by one the tentacles invaded, a steady flow of them lining up and entering her. And with each tentacle dissolved, less and less human her body became. Fingers and toes began losing definition, tapering to points and lengthening, slime beginning to secrete between them as the individual crevices grew. The purple skin came up her neck, soothing her voice box, modifying it as she released a breathy exhale. Her hair turned dark, a raven black, and green down to just below her chest as the skin made its way across her face. She felt her core filling with power with each tentacle adding itself to her internal mass. She could feel each of them, wriggling within her soul, waiting for eventual release. Her ears tapered to points, and the buds of horns began to grow from her temples. The tentacles that replaced her toes lengthened further, splitting her legs the higher they crept, ending at her crotch and developing further testicles for each of them as the ends split open into penile heads. The dark ends of the tentacles attached to her back split open slightly to reveal red demon like eyes, their own slits seemingly stuck in a consistent smile.<br />
<br />
She was lost, swimming in the pleasure the squirming tentacles gave her. Her horns grew thicker, curving back slightly and up further, soon becoming like a crown upon her head. As the last tentacle creeped its way into her hidden snatch, nestled between the eleven tentacles that replaced her legs, the power finally reached her eyes, which turned a vibrant shade of dark pink and grew slitted, the telltale sign of a demon. <br />
<br />
And as her transformation completed, she came once more, soundless as each individual tentacle that originated from her body sprayed that mist into the air, twisting the environment and corrupting the very scenery. The trees became fleshy and dark, branches losing their leaves and instead developing suckers. Each blade of grass grew a little thicker and began secreting the smallest layer of slime across the floor. The rocks weren’t even spared, breaking apart slowly to reveal phallic shaped objects and suspiciously shaped holes wet with the grass slime. And in the center of it all, the demon that was formerly Teri’s eyes fluttered.<br />
<br />
“Thank you…my children. I will not let you down.”<br />
<br />
She slowly rose upwards, just the feeling of her lower tentacles touching the grass slime eliciting a small moan and a pleasurable haze.<br />
<br />
“Teri….that was who I was. Who I am…Adagia’s newest vessel…her beloved daughter…”<br />
<br />
She breathed inwards, the perfect petiteness of her lithe body pressing against the air as she felt the ghost of a demon hug her from behind.<br />
<br />
“Talia, the Tentacle Princess. Yes, that fits…that fits very nicely…”<br />
<br />
She sighed, looking at her right hand as she morphed the finger tentacles back into actual fingers. It felt…wrong…like wearing gloves a size too small, but it helped to have something you were used to. She giggled to herself, morphing then back. Clinging onto her old life…how silly! Best to get used to things as how they are now!<br />
<br />
“Alright then, children! We’re going to need a place to stay, and this forest’s already started welcoming us, so let’s get started, shall we?”</p>
