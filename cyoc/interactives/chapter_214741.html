<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the baby mermaid or merman clapped it’s hands together a wave of energy shot out and engulfed them all. <br />
<br />
The it was as if, the mute button had been placed upon the world. The nearby soft crashing waves of the ocean seamed to be making no sound as they kept lapping up on the sandy shore. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck.” Said Nathan as the eight year old boy said a word which would have normally gotten him a very stern talking too as well as the lost of some of his video games for a few hours but neither his mom nor his dad seamed in the mood to tell him he shouldn’t say that world. <br />
<br />
“What is going on?” inquired Luke <br />
<br />
“I don’t know.” Answered Chloe as she looked down at the merbaby she was still holding.<br />
<br />
Then the baby clapped again. <br />
<br />
It happened in an micro second, all three of them felt as if their ankles had been tied together and they began to fall. <br />
<br />
Nathan fell first, followed seconds later by his father Luke, maybe it was some of the training her dad (a boxing coach who had only daughters) had given her which allowed Chloe to remain standing for a few extra seconds, but she too fell into the soft sand. Turning as she did so, so that the baby in her arms wouldn’t be crushed. <br />
<br />
All three lied in the sand for a second, before Nathan pushed himself so that he was sitting in the sand. He looked toward his feet as his eyes widened. <br />
<br />
Luke did the same.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me.” Said Luke <br />
<br />
“Now I have to tell both of you to watch your language.” complained Chloe as she got to a sitting position, the baby still in her arms only for her eyes to widen. “FUCKEN HELL!”<br />
<br />
Her legs hadn’t been tied together; they had been fused together. <br />
<br />
Her eyes darted first to her little boy, like her his ankles had fused together and worse still it wasn’t just his ankles it went halfway up to his knees. She reached out with her free arm and pulled her little boy toward her. <br />
<br />
Being a scared, eight year old meant he was more then willing to fall back into the safety of his mother’s embrace but there was no stopping the change. <br />
<br />
Once her son was now pulled toward her chest, an arm wrapped around his shoulders in a side hug, she turned her gaze toward her husband. He had pulled himself to the other side of their son, wrapping his arm around both of them protecting them both. <br />
<br />
All three of them just pulled each other closer, as their legs kept fussing together. <br />
<br />
There was a ripping sound as first Nathan and then his parents, the bottom of their swimsuits ripped apart as their legs kept fusing together into a single limb. <br />
<br />
Nathan buried his head into his mother’s chest while Chloe kept trying to reassure him everything would be alright, but she didn’t know what was happening herself. The only one who seamed to be at ease was the merbaby who was all bubbly and happy as they nuzzled into Chloe’s breast like any baby would with it’s mother. <br />
<br />
When the fusing finally stopped, all three of them had flesh colored limb which went to where there feet remained still perfectly human. <br />
Then that changed, Chloe could hear the bones snap as her feet went 180 from each other forming a straight line before her toes began to grow outwards and downwards with a thin membrane between each toe. The same thing was happening both to her son and husband, however instead of two fins, a third one had begun to grow forming Almost a Y shape. <br />
<br />
Then smaller fins began to grow, small little points different points on Chloe compared to her husband and son, as around her hips a membrane appeared forming the classic shape one saw in cartoons while none appeared around her boys hips. <br />
<br />
Then she looked into her husband’s blues eyes and he looked into hers, his eyes widened. <br />
<br />
“Your eyes have changed color.” He whispered, what he saw was his wife’s face but her blue green eyes had changed to an almost purple color. That wasn’t the only thing, she had always been beautiful, but it was as if a glamor or beauty makeup artist had gone to work. Any wrinkles she had gotten from becoming a mother was gone, her lips seamed fuller and the like. Her ears had become pointed and long like an elf even as her hair turned an even brighter shade of yellow.<br />
<br />
Chloe noticed that her husband’s look was also changing, he had always been handsome to her and other women, but every small flaw seamed to going away. Some of the minor scars he had gotten from work was disappearing on his chest and hands and his chest looked stronger as well. His face seamed more rugged even as the short bit of facial hair he had been attempting to grow for months fell out as his ears remained the same, but his hair had turned a dark golden color.<br />
<br />
Then she noticed a tightness in her chest. She looked down.<br />
<br />
Her breasts, which had always been a point of pride to her, where now slightly larger and perkier and where straining at her orange bikini top. With a slight pop, she heard the string in the back give way, however her top stayed on thanks to the string around her neck. <br />
<br />
“I think that baby is changing us.” Said Nathan as he looked at the child still held in his mother’s other arm. <br />
<br />
“This…this can’t be real.” Said Luke as he looked at his son, his son’s ears had changed to look more in line with his mother’s ears but he remained mostly unchanged aside from that. His hair color had changed to be more in line with his father’s colors compared to the brighter yellow/gold of his mother.<br />
<br />
Then the colors began to come in on their tails, a vibrant mixture of yellows, oranges and whites on Chloe. While Luke had a mixture of blues, greens and blacks, Nathan for his part had a mixture of Blues, white and black with a few orange scales as well but not many. <br />
<br />
Finally sound returned, the sound of crashing waves and the call of sea gulls as now resting in the sand just a few feet away from the crashing water is a former human now turned mermaid holding her now merman son with one arm and a merbaby they had found in the other and arms wrapped around them all is her husband now a merman as well. <br />
<br />
Sitting on the beach, is a stunned merperson family.</p>
