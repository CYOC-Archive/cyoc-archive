<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And...?&quot; Erik asked Loki. &quot;Where is he?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just right here!&quot; Loki said with a big smile on his face. In a blink, Loki turned into a blond and short kid, his green eyes shined like emeralds on his youthful face. He was wearing just a speedo like the other kids who were astounded looking at him. &quot;I&#39;ll be the captain of the team!&quot;<br />
&quot;Loki! You&#39;re smaller than us!&quot; Kyle said as he was watching the small boy in front of him. &quot;You look even younger than us!&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t age so I can&#39;t regress like you. This body it&#39;s an approach to the body of a 7 year old boy.&quot; Loki answered. &quot;But, it doesn&#39;t matter I look younger, I have the same power as my big one self.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s unfair!&quot; Erik replied. &quot;You won&#39;t need to make any effort!&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think like that. I want to have the glory of a proper victory so I will use my full power just in case we were losing&quot; Loki said.<br />
<br />
Loki and the kids walked around the pool to become familiar with the environment. Erik tried to make a prank to his father by pushing him to the water but he slipped and fell on the floor instead. Kyle was laughing as he said something about karma. Brandon was intrigued by the pool. In his mind, he had knowledge about it and a lot of other things, but he knew that he was born just a couple of hours ago and all this memories were implanted by Loki. He was fascinated by the blue color of the water, the amount of people on the place, how his father and grandfather looked like twins or the smaller boy beside him who no one could think is a powerful god. Meanwhile, Loki was thinking of a strategy to win the first place, which order they need to take in order to take advantage of their abilities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, boys.&quot; Loki said. &quot;Before the competition begins, I need to see how good are you in swimming.&quot;<br />
&quot;But we can use the pool.&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Can&#39;t you just turn us into professional swimmers?&quot;<br />
&quot;That sounds so boring...&quot; Loki replied. &quot;Where is the excitement of that? No, we need a quick practice.&quot;<br />
&quot;Actually, I don&#39;t know how to swim.&quot; Brandon said. &quot;I have never touched water in my life.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why we will take a time for practice!&quot; Loki said.<br />
&quot;But, where?&quot; Erik said. &quot;Will you take us to another pool or maybe the sea?&quot;<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t be too far from the pool.&quot; Loki answered. &quot;In the prankster god, not the time and space one!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s no other place to swim near here.&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Unless you want to swim in the fountain out here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fountain? What fountain are you talking about?&quot; Loki asked Kyle.<br />
&quot;Out here, in the school&#39;s entrance, there is a fountain with two marble statues of cherubs peeing.&quot; Erik said. &quot;It&#39;s hilarious!&quot;<br />
&quot;A fountain like that is too small for us. But you&#39;ve given me an idea.&quot; Loki said with a mischievous smile.<br />
<br />
The boys didn&#39;t get what was Loki talking about and looked to each other in confusion. But, a few seconds later, they began to fell a sudden urge to pee. They ran to a near bathroom they had looked before holding their bulges in order to control their bladders. Loki followed them behind with a big smile on his face. When he entered the bathroom, he saw that Brandon and Erik were waiting for Kyle who was using the only toilet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad! Hurry up!&quot; Erik yelled. &quot;I need to use the toilet too!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing it as fast as I can!&quot; Kyle replied.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re taking too much time!&quot; Brandon yelled too.<br />
&quot;I have a 2 inches long baby dick!&quot; Kyle replied. &quot;It isn&#39;t like if I could pee as potent as an adult.&quot;<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s the problem, I can fix it!&quot; Loki said. &quot;What do you think of a located growth spurt of 15 years in your groins?&quot;<br />
&quot;Whaaa-?&quot; Erik tried to say but he felt how his bulge was growing inside his speedo until it got an obscene and ridiculous size for a kid&#39;s body. The speedo was making a big effort to hold it inside but its shape was clearly visible through the fabric. &quot;Ugh! It&#39;s tight!&quot;<br />
&quot;Bigger it&#39;s harder to hold the need to pee.&quot; Brandon said but when he heard to hose sound coming from Kyle&#39;s peeing he finally lost control and he began to pee himself. &quot;I can&#39;t wait! Grandad give me space!&quot; He said as he ran to the toilet where Kyle was still peeing. He just looked at the huge dick his grandfather was sporting for a second when he revealed his own tool and began to pee in the toilet. At the end, Erik lost control too and joined his family in the peeing. Loki was laughing of the three kids with adults dicks peeing at the same time in a toilet.<br />
<br />
After some minutes, the boys stopped peeing and pined in relief. Loki get close to toilet where he saw how it was practically full. The water had a slightly yellowish tone but it was mostly clear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did it good!&quot; Loki said. &quot;Now we have our own pool!&quot;<br />
&quot;Pool? Are you assuming we will swim there?&quot; Kyle said. &quot;That&#39;s gross!&quot;<br />
&quot;And we are too big for swimming there!&quot; Erik said.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s no problem&quot; Loki said.<br />
&quot;Can you make us small?&quot; Brandon asked him.<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t have that power.&quot; Loki said. &quot; But I can turn you into mice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inmediately, the three kids began to shrink. Fur grew on their bodies as they turned into mice as well as long ears, claws, whiskers and a tail. After a moment, three small african pygmy mice where trapped in fabrics of the speedoes. Loki took and put them in the toilet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you can swim!&quot; Loki said. &quot;And don&#39;t worry Brandon. Animals have natural instincts for swimming!&quot;</p>
