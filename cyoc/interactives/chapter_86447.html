<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
The next day, Dan and his father were led out of their cage and down the hall. They were being led by a leash by some teenaged boy working at the dog show. Dan recognized this kid as a junior from his high school whom Dan always teased because he was such a nerd. Dan tried to ask this pimply boy for help but the kid told him to shut up. Mr Miller could only bark when ever he tried to talk. <br />
<br />
They were walking on all fours and Dan felt so weird with his dick and balls swinging between his legs. He looked up and saw his Dad&#39;s hairy ass in front of him also walking on all fours. He tried not to look at the man&#39;s big hairy dick and balls as he crawled. Mr Miller turned around and gave Dan a sad look. <br />
&quot;What a way for his son to see him&quot; he was thinking.<br />
<br />
As they rounded a corner the heard the noise of many people. Dan&#39;s dad tried to stop crawling when he realized that they were being led into a busy room full of people. The young teen holding their leashes pulled hard so the 2 naked men had no choice and found themselves dragged into a big room in front of an audience sitting on stands.<br />
<br />
Dan reminded his Dad that everyone saw them as dogs and therefore they shouldn&#39;t be embarrassed. It was still really uncomfortable being butt naked in front of the crowd and both men turned beet red as they came into view. They could feel all eyes on them. <br />
<br />
The crowd erupted into laughter.&quot; Look at them! A couple of dogs now!&quot; They heard shouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at those asses!&quot;, someone else laughed &quot;Hey Miller your a hairy beast!&quot;<br />
Dan and his Dad froze in their tracts. The people in the stands recognized them!<br />
How was this happening?<br />
<br />
There were many people the pair knew in the audience; Class mates of Dan, neighbours, People who worked for Mr. Miller. All of them were laughing and cheering. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Miller&quot;, someone called, &quot;nice dick! I guess your only going to be fucking real bitches now!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey Danny the dog-boy!&quot; a younger voice called, I guess your not playing in the game tomorrow night. Maybe you could be our mascot!&quot;<br />
<br />
This was followed by more laughter and Dan recognized the guy shouting as someone from his team. Dan and him had a rivalry so now that jerk was gloating. Both men crouched on their haunches with their hands over their groins trying to cover their nudity as best they could.<br />
<br />
The shouting and laughter went on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Miller, can I get my job back if I throw you a doggy treat?&quot; an x-employee shouted mockingly.<br />
<br />
Mr. Miller angrily turned to the audience and tried bravely to tell them all to &quot;go to hell&quot;. Of course all that came out were pathetic dog barks and the crowd laughed more.  Mr Miller realized he wasn&#39;t getting the desired effect and stopped barking. He held his head down listening to his neighbours laughter. Dan tried to turn and run but the boy holding the leash pulled him back. &quot;Bad doggy!&quot; the boy scolded. Dan realized that he couldn&#39;t get away and looked up at the nerdy kid who then pulled Dan&#39;s head down and forward by the collar. He then held Dan&#39;s head down with his foot and stooped over to slap Dan&#39;s upturned bare ass. He kept on whacking hard and the whole audience saw Dan&#39;s smooth teenaged butt turning as red as his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look the teen dog is getting a spanking!&quot; someone laughed. <br />
<br />
The boy warned them that they better both obey every order and be good doggies or things will get worse. Dan just wanted to stop the pain on his ass so he told the kid &quot;okay&quot;. His dad just barked and wondered what could possibly be worse.<br />
<br />
The kid ordered the two men to beg. They both just stared at him until he started hitting their noses. Finally the naked men gave in and  got up into begging positions on their knees with their hands raised so the whole town could get a good look at their hanging dicks. The audience, of course, shouted lewdly and whistled as the 2 men displayed their (not so private) privates to everyone. Vulgar comments and cat whistles were heard, many comparing the size and shape of each man&#39;s genitals and how much pubic hair they each had. They both just stared back at the audience hoping this humiliation would end soon.<br />
<br />
Dan and his Dad were then made to role over and then to fetch a stick that the boy threw across the room, and bring it back. All the time running on all fours panting and blushing, cocks bobbing and faces crimson red with embarrassment. Once when Mr. Miller returned with the stick in his mouth, the boy took it and patted him on the head saying &quot;good dogy&quot;. For a moment the successful macho man in his 30s felt happy that he was able to get this kid&#39;s approval and he smiled to himself for being such a good doggy. He quickly shook the feeling away with disgust. &quot;I must be going crazy&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
Finally the kid told them to sit and he turned to the audience and asked for suggestions of what he should make the &quot;dogs&quot; do next for everyone&#39;s entertainment. The two naked men sat on their haunches panting with exhaustion. Looking around wondering what they ever did to deserve this.</p>
