<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two things woke Jen Decker up that Thursday morning. One was the sound of the radio going off with its opening with some updates on things that had gone on the night before. There was some mention on the first reveal meeting, though most of the headlines that were given was more about the crowds that stood opposed to each other on opposite sides of the street than anything else. As it switched over to a rock song from the mid nineties, Jen rolled over and flipped on the plastic switches down so that the radio was turned off. Checking through the blinds above the bed, she could tell it was still dark out, though that also made sense as Jen felt the person she shared the bed with begin to stir.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last night was wonderful,&quot; Claire said as she sat up and stretched her back out for a moment, noticing that the clock was at about four thirty AM.<br />
<br />
&quot;I always aim to please...&quot; Jen smiled, &quot;though... you&#39;ll need to get to work soon and I...&quot; She was interrupted by her stomach gurgling, which was soon answered by a gurgle from Claire&#39;s stomach. &quot;...I need to get started on breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire nodded as she got up and moved toward the bathroom to get started for the day with a quick shower. While she could potentially get dirty pulling the day shift with the college&#39;s janitorial staff, that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that Claire wanted to be dirty going into work. With a six AM start time, she had to be up and ready early. To some extent, Jen was used to that as some of Jeff&#39;s schedule often went outside what would be normal for most jobs and thus even when he&#39;d had a US posting, he was up well before the sun was. And for the moment, since Jen wasn&#39;t presently employed, Jen could take the time to prepare things for Claire to make her morning easier, breakfast being one of them.<br />
<br />
Thus Jen let Claire pass and head into the bathroom before grabbing a robe off the door and putting it on. She&#39;d have her own business later in the day in her second interview for the position as Mrs. Tachibana&#39;s personal secretary, but that was later in the day. As such, she could afford to wait, especially since Claire&#39;s day started earlier. As she tied the belt for her robe around her, Jen made her way out of the bedroom and into the hallway. As she passed Tad&#39;s bedroom, she stopped briefly to listen in, and found that her son was still asleep for the moment and moved on. Tad wouldn&#39;t need to get up until six, the time when Claire&#39;s shift started. She made her way downstairs and walked through the living room and into the kitchen. As she arrived, she found a few things. The first was a note that was laying on a small &quot;breakfast table&quot; near the kitchen&#39;s back window.<br />
<br />
It read, &quot;Mom, Amy and I had a rather simple dinner. Leftovers are in the fridge when you and Claire are done for the evening. -Tad.&quot; Jen sighed and then chuckled a bit. She&#39;d been practicing for her interview when Claire came home from her shift the previous day feeling extra frisky and happy at finding new love, Jen had had a hard time saying &quot;no&quot; to Claire. The result of that was that the two of them spent enough time making love to one another that by the time they fell asleep it was late and well after when dinner was supposed to be served. A part of Jen felt a bit bad at slipping a bit, as this was normally something she stayed on top of, but at the same time she was quite proud that Tad was able to handle dinner for himself and apparently for Amy. It would be good for him, as when he graduated college and moved out into the world, he&#39;d likely have to start cooking for himself.<br />
<br />
Another gurgle from her stomach reminded her of her tasks and she quickly moved to get things ready. She might have some dishes to wash from the previous night, but that could wait until after hers and Claire&#39;s breakfast was ready. After all, they&#39;d missed dinner and it was now several hours after when they should have had dinner. Jen could actually feel her hunger and that had also been part of what had gotten her up that morning. She had missed dinner and was now very hungry. It would do her good to get herself something to eat, and she imagined that Claire was in much the same condition. She quickly gathered up the supplies for scrambling some eggs, which would be far more filling than a bowl of cereal. She was more than halfway through breakfast and even brewing coffee when Claire came down, fully dressed and in her human form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smells good,&quot; Claire said with a small smile, &quot;anything started on lunch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... just breakfast, but given that we missed dinner last night... you&#39;ll need a bigger breakfast,&quot; Jen told her, &quot;but I shouldn&#39;t be in the way of anything related to lunch if you wish to work on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to,&quot; Claire answered.<br />
<br />
The two set about finishing preparing breakfast and a hasty lunch. With Jen having had a bit of head start on breakfast, she was able to keep out of Claire&#39;s way as she prepared for a sandwich and some small sides that would go along with it. In this, Jen had breakfast ready and was even served as Claire finished packing lunch. Claire was pleased though, as it did allow for a pleasant start to the morning and before she left for work, she mad sure to wish Jen &quot;good luck&quot; when it came to the interview with Tachibana Enterprises<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Tad was up a little later in the morning, though his mission was more in relation to getting ready for school. The house was relatively quiet, though as he crossed the hallway to the bathroom he could see some light coming up the stairway. That had to mean that his mother was up, as he knew that Claire&#39;s work gave hear an early start to the day and his mother otherwise often started her day at around the same time he did. Thus if there were lights on, Jen had gotten up with Claire and did not go back to sleep. Though Tad kept his focus on getting ready for school, with a quick shave and shower being first on the agenda. It was only after that that he dressed himself and went downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Tad...&quot; his mother asked from the couch as he came downstairs, &quot;can I guess what my young man cooked for dinner last night?<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing fancy,&quot; Tad admitted, &quot;just some leftover chicken and a box of shelled pasta...it wasn&#39;t too hard to follow the instruction on the box, though I might have overdone the pasta a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must have been Hungary, given that the left over chicken is gone and there isn&#39;t too much of the left in the pot you cooked the pasta in,&quot; Jen said with a small smile as Tad crossed the living room, setting his backpack down on the couch and then moved into the kitchen. Jen soon followed after him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy stayed for dinner... and well... we kinda had a dinner date,&quot; Tad answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did she seem sick?&quot; Jen questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Tad answered with a small blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I wouldn&#39;t be too worried,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;your father wasn&#39;t necessarily a great cook when we got married and when he cooked... things tended to be fairly simple... though, I&#39;d imagine much of that had to do with the fact that his military career kept him busy enough that cooking skills remained low on his list of priorities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded, remembering the meals his father cooked, though he had to admit his dad was good at barbecue. He gathered himself a bowl of cereal  and a glass of milk while readying his own breakfast. Jen poured herself another cup of coffee while Tad poured some milk onto his cereal and listened to it crackle a little. As he finished, Tad noted his mom looking to him with a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And at the same time... if Amy liked it, you did reasonably well and with all of that, I&#39;m proud of you being able to handle things on that level,&quot; Jen told her son with a smile, &quot;given that Claire and I were a bit distracted last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you had a lot to celebrate,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;given the job offer and all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not an offer,&quot; Jen corrected, &quot;merely a second interview. And the position... while it wouldn&#39;t be the highest paying, it&#39;d be good enough that I wouldn&#39;t be able to worry too much when it comes time that I&#39;d have to go off your father&#39;s pension or Social Security because of well... being a were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could change, though,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;given the reveal and everything surrounding that. Particularly if things go well. Dad&#39;s service might get people to think more positively about weres...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded in agreement, &quot;Maybe... and hopefully that does happen. But for the moment, it would be best to wait in that regard. Coming out into the open may be a good thing, and I&#39;d even support it as a necessary measure. But there is a lot that I would be nervous over... and it would be best to be sure that things go well before everything comes out...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded. On certain levels he could agree that coming out into the open might be in the best interest of weres in general, but it would probably carry its fair share of risks and would take time to see on how humanity would react before things went further. Some of it also brought some worries for Connor as well. Connor had been one of his best friends growing up, particularly considering the times that when his father had been transferred between Quantico or some other Marine base in the US and back again there had been the risk of losing that friendship. The fact that the Ross family hadn&#39;t moved in the meantime had allowed Connor to remain a steady friend, and that was something that Tad was always glad for. The fact that Connor had accepted his being a werewolf made that even more important for him.<br />
<br />
However, the possibility that Connor could be bisexual was something that worried him. Not that he was bi, for his mother being a bisexual werecat had made Tad open to that kind of sexuality all his life. The thing that worried Tad was the knowledge that human stories on weres didn&#39;t always treat weres as the &quot;good guys&quot; in every story and many of those that did were rather knew still rare. Most of them were also rather joking in nature, which didn&#39;t come off well. That raised the worry for Tad that if things went bad with the reveal, Connor might ultimately get negative attention if he became a were and if people found out about that. For he&#39;d then face persecution as a were and as being bisexual. All of that would require a positive response to weres, and for the moment that couldn&#39;t known yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully things go well,&quot; Tad replied but went no further on the subject as he would have no further control on the subject.</p>
