<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where could she be?!&quot; Karen wondered aloud as she left her last class of the day.<br />
<br />
The &quot;she&quot; was obvious to anyone that overheard. Prior to Yvette Smith going rogue and clawing first William Anderson and then Jennifer Harper, Karen Yuletide&#39;s friendships and associates would have escaped the notice of most people. Particularly in Moon Lake where Karen&#39;s status as a normal who might likely leave Moon Lake after college would mean that her presence wouldn&#39;t be long lasting. However, after events that lead to Jenny&#39;s entrance into were society and then Karen getting attention from Peter Talbot had created the thing lead to more people learning about Karen Yuletide. It my be limited to looking at the campus directory, but it was enough to learn that Karen&#39;s roommate was Jenny Harper. It&#39;d thus stand to reason that Karen and Jenny were friends, and thus with the &quot;she&quot; that Karen was referring to was Jenny.<br />
<br />
And Karen was worried about her friend. They didn&#39;t share any classes this semester. Some of their electives were the same, but they were at different times of the day and thus they weren&#39;t in same class together. However, that didn&#39;t mean that they didn&#39;t see each other from time to time. Many times they did get to share lunch, which she figured might be the only time they&#39;d get to hang out once she and Harry got married. Karen had even had a few day dreams in which she and Peter hosted Jenny and Harry over for coffee in their respective were forms, lion and lioness and dog-fox and vixen. However, today, Karen hadn&#39;t seen Jenny at all and that raised concerns and worry, particularly with the knowledge that there was a second agent in Moon Lake that this Dieter Wilhelm guy had sent.<br />
<br />
&quot;He couldn&#39;t,&quot; Karen thought to herself as she walked along the sidewalk as a thought flashed through her mind that this agent had grabbed Jenny and had taken her somewhere, &quot;He couldn&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen came to a rapid stop and pulled her backpack off and began rummaging through it. She eventually found her phone inside her bag and pulled it out. Her fingers flew across the buttons and she then raised the phone to her ear and waited for an answer and even hoping for an answer. After a couple of rings Karen got the answer she was waiting for and she was greatly relieved to get the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; came Jenny&#39;s voice, sounding more tired than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny where are you?&quot; Karen blurted, &quot;I haven&#39;t seen you all day! Are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen?&quot; was Jenny&#39;s answer. She sounded a bit surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s me,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;physically, anyway...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Physically?&quot; Karen wondered, noting how Jenny&#39;s voice had tailed off at the end, &quot;This agent do something? Did he get Harry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he thinks did,&quot; Jenny said in a low voice, &quot;apparently he shot Harry&#39;s brother this morning. Harry and I found out about it toward the end of our first class of the day and we&#39;ve spent the rest of the day at the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he okay?&quot; Karen asked, &quot;Is Harry okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harry&#39;s fine,&quot; Jenny assured her, &quot;and his brother will be fine... which was lucky. He had to go into surgery and hasn&#39;t woken up yet. We&#39;re still waiting for him to wake up... and we&#39;ve all been taking turns trying to keep a friend of Harry&#39;s brother feeling confident. She&#39;s seemed to take his being shot worse than Harry or his parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he&#39;ll be okay, right?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;sorry to worry you... the day has been hectic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;Did the police catch the guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I don&#39;t know,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;the last report we got was that they were chasing him, but we don&#39;t know if he was caught.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... hopefully they did catch him,&quot; Karen spoke, &quot;tell Harry that I hope things turn out well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will, thanks,&quot; Jenny replied.<br />
<br />
From there, the phone call ended and Karen put her phone back in her backpack and prepared to resume her walk to where she supposed to meet Peter at the end of the day. She liked the time she&#39;d been able to spend with the Talbots as Leon and Regina had been very accepting of her, even though she wasn&#39;t born to Moon Lake and she had to admit that the bed in the guest room was comfortable. It worked well, though from time to time Karen had even figured to sneak over to Peter&#39;s room and at least start with some cuddling. After all, she was pretty sure that Peter Talbot was the man for her. Then as she zipped up her backpack she looked up to see Peter leaning casually against lamppost.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter!&quot; Karen stated and came forward, &quot;sorry I was late... I hadn&#39;t seen Jenny all day and was a bit worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it that it was Jenny that you called?&quot; Peter asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Karen nodded, &quot;she&#39;s fine... though she&#39;s had a fairly stressful day...&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter put his arm around her as Karen relayed what she knew about what had happened. His grip was firm and protective and grew more so as Karen continued. The more he heard about this Dieter Wilhelm, even if it was second hand, the less he liked the man and the more he figured it was a good idea to get as much help as possible to protect Jenny and Harry. He hadn&#39;t known Jenny before the connection through Karen was established and his knowledge of Harry was pretty much limited to another face he&#39;d seen in hall while in high school, but since meeting Karen, those connections were forged. Jenny and Harry struck him as good people and were certainly good friends to Karen. They didn&#39;t deserve some jerk from another state giving them grief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hopefully they catch him and that puts Mr. Wilhelm in the place he belongs,&quot; Peter answered when Karen finished the story, neither of them knowing that Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s second agent had been caught and had done precisely that.</p>
