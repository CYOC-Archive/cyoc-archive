<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Edit: started mixing up names, apologies, y&#39;all</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colby couldn’t ignore the morning light any longer and finally opened his eyes. He couldn’t believe he’d fallen asleep in Tyler’s bed, and shit; what time is it? he wondered. His jostling in bed brought his attention to his rock-hard morning erection; it felt good and warm under the sheets, nestled between Tyler’s tight little cheeks as he spooned the slightly smaller man. His cheeks weren’t so little any more, Colby couldn’t help but notice. Feeling his friends ass in his hands last night, Colby could tell it was getting bigger and fuller. He knew it was changing as well, becoming more pliable and elastic to accommodate large men like him. God, Colby thought, I love my cock. Since he’d measured his first new inch, his cock had done nothing to disappoint, growing larger and girthier with each passing day. His balls too had swelled in size fairly quickly. Before, he’d always felt like his balls looked small in comparison to his below average, seven-inch cock. His rapid transition had changed all that. Now if anything he would say they were almost two large; he felt like he was stuffing grapefruits into his underwear. At least he had an eager small-dick to drain them. <br />
<br />
He looked down at Tyler, still asleep with his back pressed against Colby’s broad, hairy chest. He began to lightly thrust his hard schlong between Tyler’s legs, eliciting a soft sigh from the small-dick. He almost felt kind of bad for his friend; here he was enjoying his ever-growing slab of man-meat while Tyler’s cocklet dwindled smaller every day. Colby was proud to be a large-dick, but he was also a little mad at himself for enjoying it so much. Sure, teasing Tyler about his shrinking endowment made him feel so powerful and masculine, but he was also secretly counting his blessings. He’d always had a bit of a crush on his friend; he didn’t know if that made him gay or bisexual or whatever. But something about Tyler had always made him hard. When Tyler had opened up to him about his transition, Colby almost couldn’t believe his luck. A real small-dick, in his backwater town, and his best friend no less? Score! His guilt was small compared to his overwhelming joy. He could feel his cock swell; he wondered how big he was today? He wondered how small Tyler was as well. Colby snaked his hand around Tyler’s narrowing waist until his fingers met something small and hard, roughly the dimensions of a thinner D size battery. Tyler’s cock, Colby realized with a snicker. The little cocklet jolted and strained against Colby’s big fingers, but Tyler remained fast asleep. Colby searched with his fingers for Tyler’s balls, finding two marble shaped bumps at the base of his hard little chode. Fuck, he’s so small, He thought. There won’t be anything left at this rate. Colby continued to pressed and squeeze Tyler’s little cock between his other hand to reach down to drag out the length of his cock from between Tyler’s legs. Fuck, it feels thicker, and heavier, Colby remarked inwardly. His balls felt heavy as well, heavy with his boy’s breakfast, Tyler thought.<br />
<br />
Colby backed himself up a bit to make room for the length of his cock, gripping the bulbous head, loving how it felt like holding a baseball in his hand, before directing it between Tyler’s soft cheeks. The small-dick groaned and arched his back as the head of Colby’s enormous rod slipped inside of him like a glove. Colby was shocked at how easily the first few inches of his cock glided inside of his friend, but absolutely overwhelmed by the sensation of Tyler’s ass clamped around the head of his cock. He held himself there for a moment, just the tip, running his hands along Tyler’s back and squeezing his boy’s ass, staring down at where the shaft of his cock disappeared into Tyler’s asshole. He pressed himself deeper, focusing with all his might not to come right there and then. A small, warm hand on his shaft informed him that Tyler was awake.<br />
<br />
“Mmm…Morning. What’s up, buddy? He said groggily, barely registering the four inches of cock buried in his hole.<br />
<br />
“This,” Colby muttered before thrusting himself in further. Tyler bucked as he felt his insides pressed open by Colby’s invading schlong. Colby used his hands to grip Tyler on his hip and shoulder, taking leverage to drive more of himself deeper in. <br />
<br />
“Does it feel bigger to you?” Colby whispered into Tyler’s ear as he drove another inch of his cock into the small-dick. “You feel smaller to me.” Tyler reached down to feel his cocklet, but Colby grabbed his wrist. “No,” he ordered, “Don’t touch your pathetic little nub. I’ll make you feel good, baby.” He continued pressing harder, forcing more of his cock into Tyler’s ass, until he felt the head of his cock meet a resistance. At the same time, Tyler’s hand whipped over to press itself against Colby’s thrusts.<br />
<br />
“Stop, please, it won’t go any further,” Tyler moaned, feeling unfamiliar muscles in his ass clamp down on Colby’s cock.<br />
<br />
“You sure, baby? Only a few more inches…” Colby gyrated himself while inside of Tyler, making the small-dick writhe beside him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, god…Yes. Don’t pull out, just….don’t go any deeper.” Tyler twisted himself to get a look at Colby’s cock disappearing within him. “I don’t think I’m ready for the whole thing yet.” He gasped.<br />
<br />
“You better hope you become ready,” Colby growled, thrusting his cock in and out of Tyler as deep as he could manage. “I’m a growing boy,” Colby fucked Tyler for another few minutes, occasionally thrusting himself deeper so as the make him moan and yelp. He wasn’t thinking about the noise, or whether or not Tyler’s father could hear them. He could only think about how impossibly soft and tight Tyler’s ass felt around his shaft. He was ready to blow right there, but he didn’t want to deny his small-dick his breakfast, so he brought his pace to a halt and pulled Tyler close.<br />
<br />
“You ready to get fed, babe?” he whispered into Tyler’s ear.<br />
<br />
“Yes, please, Sir,” Tyler mumbled. Colby’s cock became rock hard when Tyler called him sir. He yanked himself free from Tyler’s near perfect ass and rolled himself on top of Tyler, straddling the small-dick’s face so that he could feed his massive cock down Tyler’s throat. He felt Tyler’s hands reach between his legs to caress his aching balls, giving each a squeeze. Colby loved how Tyler practically worshiped his junk. And what small-dick wouldn’t Colby thought, as he pounded into Tyler’s jaw, imagining that he was back inside the small-dicks tight rectum once again. He fucked Tyler like an animal until finally his felt his balls heave and churn as his orgasm hit him, dumping another healthy and heavy load down his long cock and into Tyler’s grateful stomach. He could feel Tyler’s hands gently massaging every last drop. He watched Tyler lift up his pelvis as the small-dick came as well, his hands free from his cock just like he was told. He pulled himself out of Tyler’s maw and scooted down the bed so he could hold his friend in his arms again. Tyler spun around so that he could press his face against Colby’s hairy chest. He liked this feeling, holding his small-dick close after a good fucking, It made him feel strong and powerful, but in a different way. But then, Colby felt a different kind of pressure between the legs and pulled reluctantly pulled himself out of bed.<br />
<br />
“Where are you going?” Tyler protested, lifting his head.<br />
<br />
“Just gotta pee, little buddy. Don’t get up.” He flashed Tyler a grin.<br />
<br />
“Wait! Put on some clothes, you big-dicked idiot,” Tyler laughed, pointing at Colby’s still semi-hard cock.<br />
<br />
After struggling into his sweatpants and t-shirt, Colby quietly stepped out of the room and made sure the door was shut before padding down the hallway to the bathroom. He chuckled to himself as he stood over the toilet, waiting for the last of his erection to subside so that he could actually go. Colby was thinking that he couldn’t wait to measure himself before work when he noticed Tyler’s father staring at him from across the room, perched on the couch. Mr. P had an unreadable expression on his face, but raising one of his heavy fists he gave Colby the ‘come here&#39; gesture with his finger. Colby’s eyes widened as he walked across the room to approach Tyler’s father. <br />
<br />
The man just stared up at him from his perch on the couch, a cup of hot coffee in his hand, his long legs spread to display the hard length running along his left thigh. Colby could tell even soft Mr. P was bigger than he was hard. Tyler’s father held up a finger and said,<br />
<br />
“You better take good care of my boy, boy,” James said, his free hand resting on the hardening shaft in his pants, as if to remind Colby who was really the biggest man in this house. <br />
<br />
“Yessir,” mumbled Colby, feeling sheepish.<br />
<br />
James nodded. “Say hi to your dad for me,” he said, before gesturing at Colby to leave. Colby didn’t need to be told twice and hot-footed himself back to Tyler’s room, shutting the door quietly behind him. <br />
<br />
Shit, Colby thought, we have to be more quiet from now on.</p>
