<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dean is amazed at how fast he is, the former human teen, now a big black Thoroughbred Arabian Stallion, feels so powerful that he is sure any Mare would get weak in his presence. He chuckles to himself, &#39;hehe... I wish I could see myself,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;I bet I am a looker!&#39;<br />
<br />
As Dean closes in on Jeff/Sahara, already smelling the “Mare&#39;s” heat scent, which causes his new cock to twitch in its sheath, starting to erect, a thought pops into his mind, &#39;I bet it would be fun to pretend that I am a normal horse,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;I bet, Jeff will suspect that it is me, so I will either pretend I don&#39;t understand him... her... or I just say that I am not Dean... Hmmm... what name should I give myself? Aaaah... I know: Lightning! Yeah! That name suits me well!&#39;<br />
<br />
Dean spots Jeff/Sahara in the distance, he grins to himself as he slows down into a trot, then into a normal walk, &#39;I&#39;ll act as if I were just some random curious Stallion,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;let&#39;s see what her reaction is when she notices me.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff is still grumbling mentally to himself, while eating grass, &#39;I can&#39;t believe Dean tricked me,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;if I would have known that he plans to breed me, I would have NEVER accepted being transformed into a Mare. I thought we were friends, but then again... Dean is a perv, no matter if it comes to humans or animals... he is so weird... he finds anything and everything “exciting”. Fuck! If Furniture or Vehicles could have sex... NOPE, not going there!&#39;<br />
<br />
When Jeff hears the sound of hooves coming closer, he looks up and turns his head, he notices a big black Horse coming towards him in a curious way. &#39;Hu? Who&#39;s that,&#39; Jeff asks himself, &#39;could be Dean, wouldn&#39;t surprise me. The way he acted earlier, it sounded as if he WANTED to fuck me... buuut... it could simply be some other Horse belonging to his family.&#39; As the Horse comes closer, Jeff gets a whiff of the Horses scent, a strong masculine smell, &#39;defiantly male... and, by the smell of it, a HORNY male! Fuck me... NOT! I know I can&#39;t become pregnant, according to Dean, but I don&#39;t really trust even that! It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he lied to me, thinking it would be funny. Knowing him and the way he acted lately, he&#39;d do ANYTHING just to keep me like this!&#39;<br />
<br />
When Dean is close enough, the male horse lets out a nicker, “well, well, what do we have here,” he asks in horse language, Deans voice had changed due to his thicker vocal cords, making his voice sound richer and deeper, so Jeff couldn&#39;t tell if the male horse is Dean or not.<br />
<br />
“Stop it,” Jeff replies, tilting her head and looking skeptical at the male horse, “I know it is you... Dean!”<br />
<br />
Dean acts as if taken by surprise, “Dean,” he asks, “who is Dean?”<br />
<br />
Jeff rolls her eyes, “you think I&#39;m stupid and dumb,” she asks, “I KNOW it is you! I know you long enough to know that, once you have your mind set on one thing: you do what ever it takes to achieve the goal!”<br />
<br />
Dean lets out a snort, which sounds like a laugh, “that sounds like the son of my owner,” he says.<br />
<br />
“See? I knew... wait... what,” Jeff asks, sounding confused.<br />
<br />
Dean grins inwardly, &#39;hehe, he is so easy to fool,&#39; he thinks to himself, he then nods and says, “Dean&#39;s dad bought me a week ago, he hasn&#39;t told Dean, wanting it to be a surprise.”<br />
<br />
Jeff tilts his head, “why not tell Dean about you,” she asks, Jeff&#39;s head is buzzing from the scent of the male horse, causing her to feel a little dizzy. Jeff has a hard time trying to ignore the feeling and thoughts running through her head, and the warm and moist feeling coming from her pussy.<br />
<br />
“From what I understood, I am not really good with human language and intentions, his dad planned to surprise Dean with gifting me to him,” he says, “I overheard his dad say, something like, “if Dean wins the race with Sahara, then I would want to surprise him with the perfect Stallion to breed and create amazing race horses”.”<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes widen, “and I thought Dean was a pervert,” he mumbles, “well, like father like son, I guess,” he then looks up at the male horse. Jeff lets out a sigh, “sorry, for suspecting you as my perverted friend,” he says, “and sorry for being so impolite... I... I just had some rough weeks... and being in heat is... not to my liking!”<br />
<br />
The “Stallion” nods, “I can smell your heat pheromones,” he says, his cock fully erect, “it is hard to keep the urge from jumping you under control.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “y-yeah, any other Stallion would have already attacked me,” she says, “so... why aren&#39;t you?”<br />
<br />
The “Stallion” chuckles, “oh... I just have a lot more experience and know how to keep my urges under control. By the way, my name is Lightning, and I assume you are “Sahara”?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “y-yeah... nice meeting you, Lightning,” she says politely.<br />
<br />
“Same,” “Lightning” says, there is a long silence, before he asks, “I can sense that you do not want to... you know... be bred. Why?”<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitates, &#39;Lightning seems friendly, but I don&#39;t know if I can trust him,&#39; he thinks to himself, “I...,” he starts then stops.<br />
<br />
Dean/Lightning walks a little closer, he then softly nudges the “Mare&#39;s” snout, “you can tell me, Sahara,” he says quietly, “you can trust me. I hate seeing you like this, so wound up and frustrated, so please, tell me.”<br />
<br />
Jeff continues to hesitate, &#39;something tells me I should trust him,&#39; he thinks to himself, unaware that it is the “Mare-part” of his mind, “okay... fine... y-you see... I haven&#39;t been like this a couple of weeks ago.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean,” the Stallion asks.<br />
<br />
“I... was... I mean I AM in reality a human male teenager,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Lightning” acts surprised, he takes a step back, “what... how...?”<br />
<br />
Jeff lowers her head, scraping the ground with a hoof before starting to explain, “yeah... it all started when I told Dean about a program called “The Chronivac”,” he starts, “I told him, since it was his birthday, he could choose what I should become. You see, this program is able to transform anything and anyone into various things.”<br />
<br />
“Lightning” tilts his head, “so, a human made program, supposedly is able to transform a human into an animal and even change their gender,” he asks, Jeff nods. Dean is grinning inwardly, &#39;man, I should get an Oscar for my performance, Jeff doesn&#39;t suspect a thing, this is so much fun,&#39; he thinks to himself, “please, continue,” he then says.<br />
<br />
“Well, he decided to want me to become a horse, so that he could win a horse race, and have a temporary replacement for his deceased horse,” Jeff continues.<br />
<br />
“Lightning” nods, “yeah, I have heard about the pacing of his friend,” he says, “it has been pretty hard for the poor boy.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yeah... loosing someone is hard and messes up the personality of some,” he says, “anyway, I agreed to it, but I didn&#39;t know that he would transform me into a Mare, I was so pissed off.”<br />
<br />
The “Stallion” nods, “I understand,” he says, “I would have been mad if someone would transform or change something about me against my will.”<br />
<br />
Jeff again nods, “anyway, I thought I would be back to normal after the race,” he continues, he feels anger raise in him, he stomps the ground with a front hoof and his tail swishes, “BUT he tricked me! He told me that he set the Chronivac so that I go into heat, because apparently, the horse that wins the race is supposed to be bred with the second winner. I told him that I am not a freaking Mare and that I don&#39;t want to end up pregnant!”<br />
<br />
“Lightning” nods, “I understand,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Dean then said, that he set the Chronivac so that I can not become pregnant,” Jeff says, “now here I am: a former 16-year-old boy turned Mare in heat,” Jeff lets out a angry snort. “He then proposed to me earlier what I would think about HIM being the Stallion that fucks me. Thinking I would agree to it! But I told him that I do not want to get fucked by ANYONE! I AM NOT A MARE!”<br />
<br />
“Whoa,” the “Stallion” says, “calm down, Saha... sorry, I mean Jeff,” he says.<br />
<br />
“S-sorry,” Jeff says, “these effing female hormones...,” he trails off, hanging his head.<br />
<br />
Seeing Jeff like this seems to open Dean&#39;s eyes, &#39;I guess I went a little to far,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;he... she looks so miserable. BUT since we are in this situation, I just have to do it!&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff lets out a snort, “I hate my life,” he mumbles, “I wish I had never told Dean about the Chronivac.”<br />
<br />
“Lightning” walks up to Jeff/Sahara and lightly nuzzles her snout, “I am sorry, for what Dean has done to you,” he says, “I hope you can forgive him.”<br />
<br />
“I... don&#39;t know,” Jeff says, “he really hurt my trust in him,” he leans in to “Lightning&#39;s” nuzzling, starting to relax.<br />
<br />
Dean smiles when he feels “Sahara” lean in to his nuzzling, “you seem to like that,” he says.<br />
<br />
“I must admit,” Jeff says, “it is quite soothing,” he leans in closer, closing his eyes and lets out a murr. “Thanks for listening to me,” he then says, looking at the “Stallion”, “it felt good to talk about it with someone who actually seems to understand, even though you are a “simple” and “normal” Stallion: you have a good heart!”<br />
<br />
“Lightning” chuckles, “why, thank you,” he says, they stand there for another minute or so, before “Lightning” speaks up again. “I know you don&#39;t want to hear this,” he says carefully, “but... don&#39;t you want to at least give it a try? You have nothing to fear, you said that you won&#39;t become pregnant, and it&#39;ll help make you feel better.”<br />
<br />
Jeff looks at Lightning, he takes a few steps back, looking over the Stallion&#39;s body for the first time: his amazing beautiful brown eyes, his shiny black coat, his muscles... his sheath and cock, which is still at full mast. Jeff feels how much his body wants this magnificent creature to mount her, the thought of that huge cock inside of her needy pussy... . Jeff lets out a sigh, “o-okay... I guess I can give it a try,” he says.<br />
<br />
Dean smirks inwardly, “I promise I&#39;ll be gentle,” he says, “I know you are scared, but... it&#39;ll feel really good, I promise you that, Sahara.”<br />
<br />
“I...,” Jeff says, he feels his tummy doing somersaults, his body feeling even hotter and his pussy wetter than before, “I trust... you,” he says, he then lets the instincts take over as he turns his body, moving his tail to the side, presenting HIS wet and virgin pussy to the Stallion, unaware that the Stallion is Dean, who is simply playing with Jeff&#39;s emotions. Jeff closes her eyes, &#39;I can&#39;t believe I am actually going through with this...,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;I am going to be fucked by a horse!&#39;</p>
