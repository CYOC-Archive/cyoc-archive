<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elizabeth followed Gina into the clubhouse.  Two of her torsos entered simultaneously, side by side as she glided through the door.  Ahead was the sign-in desk and equipment checkout staffed by a clearly bored 19 or 20 year old girl texting on her phone.  To the right she saw 2 women whom she recognized as Cassie and Vanessa, but was instantly stunned by their appearances.<br />
<br />
Folded behind Cassie were brown wings the same color as her hair.  They were closed and extended about 3 feet above her head.  Instead of feet, Cassie had talons at the end of her legs.  Occupying Cassie&#39;s chest were 4 large breasts.  4 arms hung at her side, and with both left hands she held hands with Vanessa.<br />
<br />
Vanessa had always been pretty tan whenever Elizabeth ran into her.  The Vanessa before her was beyond tan - her skin was cherry red.  Two petite red horns protruded from her forehead and curved slightly up at the end.  Vanessa also had wings but hers were far smaller than Cassie&#39;s and looked like they were covered in red skin instead of feathers.  A couple inches of wing were visible above Vanessa&#39;s shoulders but that was it: they seemed more meant for appearance than actual flight.  Wrapped around one of Cassie&#39;s legs was a red tail ending in an adorable red heart.  The other end vanished up Vanessa&#39;s shorts.<br />
<br />
Gina waved to the pair and continued on to the check-in desk, like normal.  However, Elizabeth stopped slithering and 2 jaws fell open in surprise.  Vanessa was busy whispering something into Cassie&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
Cassie spoke first, &quot;Whoa.  Liz?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa turned away from her girlfriend to look at Elizabeth, let out a squeak of surprise and/or terror and rocketed skyward.  She landed upside down 15 feet straight up, stiletto heels on the ceiling rafters.  Her tail wrapped around Cassie&#39;s leg had pulled Cassie with her, and the winged girl was now very confused and hanging upside down from Vanessa&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!  You&#39;ll never take me!  Tell Damon I&#39;m never going back!&quot; Vanessa yelled at Elizabeth and took a couple steps backwards.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth stared in shock at the upside down red-skinned girl.  She held out her 8 visible hands, palms forward and slithered a few feet backwards.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;ss going on here.  Casssie?  Vanesssa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie screeched and plummeted as Vanessa&#39;s tail failed to hold her weight and gave way.  Her wings flew open and beat a few times, enough to slow her descent and she safely landed on her knees and all 4 hands.  She looked over at Elizabeth.  &quot;Liz?  Is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
All 4 of Elizabeth&#39;s heads nodded enthusiastically to Cassie.<br />
&quot;Yess.&quot;  <br />
Outside the clubhouse, Elizabeth&#39;s 4 other heads nervously looked inward at herself.  The same two thoughts rapidly circulated through those 4 minds - <i>What is going on?!?</i> , <i>Cassie and Vanessa aren&#39;t human?!?</i><br />
<br />
Cassie stood up on her... talons... and took a few cautious steps towards Elizabeth.  From the ceiling, Vanessa cried out &quot;Cassie!  No!  Don&#39;t get in striking range!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie glanced back at Vanessa,<br />
&quot;Calm down, V.  If she was going to attack me, she&#39;d have done it when you dropped me on the floor.  I think it&#39;s actually Liz.&quot;<br />
Cassie looked back at Elizabeth and looked between her 4 faces.<br />
&quot;I recognize her face.  It&#39;s weird, but... I believe she&#39;s Liz.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa called down, &quot;Prove it!  You, what&#39;s your full name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth sighed with 1 head while she responded with another, &quot;Elizabeth Marilyn Cartwrite.  There, happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa closed her eyes and her face scrunched up.  A couple seconds later her eyes flashed open again and she dropped from the ceiling, gracefully flipping upright as she fell.  She landed daintily and took a few steps forward.  &quot;Sorry for reacting like that.  I thought you were...  I thought Damon... Uh.  It&#39;s uh... Complicated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie rolled her eyes and wrapped 2 left arms around Vanessa&#39;s shoulders.  Vanessa&#39;s tail once again wrapped around Cassie&#39;s leg.  Cassie leaned over and gave Vanessa a quick kiss on the cheek then turned back to Elizabeth.<br />
&quot;Okay Liz, spill the beans.  That&#39;s an impressive form, how&#39;d you get it?&quot;<br />
Cassie motioned towards Elizabeth&#39;s torsos and then towards her tail holding the clubhouse door ajar.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth glanced around to make sure no-one was listening in.  To her horror, she spotted Gina and the clubhouse employee staring at them.  Gina looked surprised and confused, while the other girl looked petrified by horror.<br />
&quot;Uh.  We might have a problem.&quot;<br />
Elizabeth motioned towards the 2 stunned women.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck.&quot; Vanessa muttered.  She vanished out from under Cassie&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
Cassie sighed and turned back to Elizabeth, &quot;Does Gina know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... know what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie rolled her eyes as she asked, &quot;Seriously?  When did you change?  When were you last human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm.  About 24 hourss ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.  And was this your first time with magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth nodded 4 times over.<br />
<br />
Cassie raised 2 open right hands to her forehead, double facepalming.  She called out, <br />
&quot;V, I don&#39;t think Gina knows either...&quot;<br />
Then she looked back over to Elizabeth and grimaced,<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t have a personal normalization enchantment then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth just stared at Cassie like she was speaking an alien language.  Another double facepalm.  A gasp from the desk caught Elizabeth&#39;s attention and she looked over to see that Vanessa had reappeared and pulled the employee into a deep kiss.  Gina stared in shock at the bright red woman next to her.<br />
<br />
Cassie grabbed Elizabeth&#39;s arms and ran to the clubhouse door, pulling 2 of Elizabeth&#39;s torsos behind her.  She was stronger than she looked, but Elizabeth instinctively knew that if she wanted she could resist and Cassie wouldn&#39;t have any chance of moving her.  Cassie pushed open the outer set of doors and gasped when she saw 2 more Elizabeth torsos waiting outside.<br />
<br />
Cassie turned to the nearest Elizabeth head, &quot;Good god Liz, just how far did you take this?  Come on, we&#39;re going to my place.  We have to put some distance between us and the clubhouse so the veil can re-energize.  <i>ESPECIALLY</i> you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, that was some form of direction that Elizabeth could understand.  She didn&#39;t understand <i>why</i> it was so important why they left, but Cassie&#39;s tone made it obvious that there was no choice, they had to.  What she did know was where Cassie lived.  Without waiting for her to say anything else she grabbed Cassie by the waist with 4 arms, picked her up and held her about a foot off the ground then speedily slithered towards Cassie&#39;s apartment.<br />
<br />
Like when she had carried Gina earlier, she could sense that Cassie had weight to her body, but couldn&#39;t feel the weight impacting her.  Though Cassie did feel a lot lighter than Gina had.  It only took Elizabeth about 15 seconds to slither the ~200 yards (or 600 feet) down the road to Cassie&#39;s apartment.<br />
<br />
Cassie gasped as if catching her breath when Elizabeth deposited her on the concrete in front of her apartment door,<br />
&quot;That was... something else.&quot;<br />
She fumbled and eventually got her keys out and the door unlocked.  She stepped in and motioned Elizabeth in.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth slithered into Cassie&#39;s apartment.  She had never visited before, but saw that it had a floor plan similar to her own.  After a split second decision she slithered into the living room area.  As more and more of her body slithered in through the apartment front door, she coiled portions of her lengthy snake body to make room, slowing down her entry, but allowing her to actually fit in the living room.<br />
<br />
Finally she got her full body into the living room.  She dominated the space of the living room, occupying about 80% of the floor space.  Her torsos lay stomach-down on the tops of 4 separate coils ranging in height from 3 feet to a towering 7 feet.  Her middle tail section, the largest part of her body, had successfully coiled into 4 coils along the wall, each about 8 feet tall.<br />
<br />
Cassie closed and locked the door before collapsing on the sofa.  She looked around at the masses of tail coiled around her living room then focused on the nearest head she could see,<br />
&quot;Wow Liz.  Just... wow.  You don&#39;t do things in half measures, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth giggled, &quot;To be honesst, I wasn&#39;t exactly thinking about day to day life.  Just wanted to have a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie nodded, &quot;So what did this to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a sset of a potionss.  I bought it from a sspellcraft sstore at the mall.  The vialss have different zodiac ssignss, and I ended up mixing them a bit.  It wasn&#39;t human sstraight to this, I took a few dossess to get here.  4, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that makes a lot of sense.  That category of transformatives has a tendency to make the user somewhat underestimate what exactly they&#39;re doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth shrugged, &quot;At the end, yeah it definitely did.  I actually went into it planning to change, have a night of fun in my bedroom and change back before going to ssleep.  But uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things went differently?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;ss a good way to put it.  Gina came home with food ssicknesss, which kinda interrupted my intended flow and then I uh...&quot; Elizabeth blushed as she recalled exactly how she fell asleep the night prior.  &quot;...I think my last change put me to ssleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie smiled knowingly, &quot;Yep, sometimes they do that.  But you&#39;re still changed now.  What happened this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth&#39;s blush deepened, &quot;Well uh, I woke up, disscovered what I had become and was meassuring mysself when Gina reminded me about the tenniss match we had sscheduled and at that point there wassn&#39;t enough time to change back sso I figured I&#39;d just try it like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie raised an eyebrow, &quot;Uh-huh.  Let&#39;s say, hypothetically, the tennis match had gone off just fine.  Think you would have changed back afterwards?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth thought for a moment, &quot;I don&#39;t know.  I like my body.  But I also like thiss.  Being thiss weird ssnake human hybrid iss fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie nodded, &quot;Interesting.  I expected you to be a lot more decisive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been watching your motion and mannerisms.  You aren&#39;t behaving like your mind was just stuffed into that form and given a night of sleep to adjust.  You&#39;re far more graceful and natural than that.  There&#39;s a certain beauty to it, and it might mean you have an innate affinity for adapting to other forms, or it might mean you&#39;re more comfortable in this form than being a human.  Either way, keep that in mind when V gets back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh... okay? &quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie grinned, &quot;Based on what V has been psychically whispering to me, we&#39;re going to...&quot;</p>
