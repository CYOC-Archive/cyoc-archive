<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And the desire for peace was a big part of what Rachel wanted, largely because of what Leslie had done to her. On certain levels, the discussion with Angela&#39;s pride eased a lot of her fears worries and concerns about being a werecat. In a strange way, the polite and welcoming conversation, and the fact that no one was just pushing toward anything sexual and just talking with her, made her comfortable and welcome in her were form, for what felt like the first time. But that didn&#39;t change her feelings about what Leslie had done to her, and in taking her choice of what she was to be away from her. It left a part of her mind figuring that if Leslie had explained things and been honest with her, and even agreed to wait for the right and romantic moment, Rachel might have willingly become a werecat. But Leslie didn&#39;t do that and that was what Rachel most resented.<br />
<br />
But being able to talk with Angela&#39;s pride helped a lot and gave her some feelings of acceptance that felt nice. Rachel wasn&#39;t going to waste that as the meeting moved forward as she more formally introduced herself to Laura and Erica and their daughters Kimberly and Sharon. She was careful in discussing how she became a werecat, as Jessica was still present, but it was enough that the newcomers did understand, and some friendly pats on the back from Cynthia kept Rachel going as well. It was something that gave her confidence and comfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sort of force,&quot; Laura said slowly, &quot;that is wrong...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... because of how what my former girlfriend did was likely calculated and planned,&quot; Rachel nodded, &quot;and it&#39;s left me wrestling with all sorts of things. Ranging to this form being a part of me now... some of the introduction of more cat like instincts at times... and gaining control over myself. It&#39;s been a rough journey, and that&#39;s partially why I&#39;ve come to this meeting. As it&#39;s let me get some answers and see a friend who&#39;s been there to help me at the college so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad the others were here to help,&quot; Erica spoke, &quot;as I said... no one should be FORCED to become a were. Accidents happen...&quot; she paused to give a small chuckle, &quot;and I know that all too well, but accidents are not intended and often a solum apology does a lot. And if real love is there, that accident can be overcome. Which is what happened with Laura and I and enabled us to move forward and have our two wonderful daughters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel then looked to Kimberly and Sharon who had settled down onto the bench next to Sadie while Laura and Erica sat down on the opposite side of that table next to Maggie. It was something that showed the comforts that the pride has. Though, while Rachel had interests in getting some last answers regarding gaining control, the last line that Erica had given raised some curiosity. For while Isabelle was Angela&#39;s biological daughter, as was Jessica, and that Linus and Julia had a daughter, Cynthia&#39;s cousin, those were from the result of their marriages to male weres. Laura and Erica were clearly married to each other, and yet, Kimberly and Sharon seemed to have enough of a similarity in their scents to their mothers that Rachel was puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have  your daughters?&quot; Rachel asked, curiosity dominating her voice at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I gave birth to Kimberly,&quot; Laura spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I gave birth to Sharon,&quot; Erica commented, &quot;no... like many werecats, we are full lesbians, so there wasn&#39;t any interest in hooking up with a male were... but we DID want children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which can be a bit difficult for werecats,&quot; Martha added to the explanation, &quot;those of us that are lesbians generally won&#39;t be able to conceive children... unless some wizard is out there that could make a lady were a hermaphrodite...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be weird,&quot; Isabelle commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And has never happened,&quot; Martha nodded, &quot;so those of us that are that way have often adopted children, which I did with Sarah. Who has been dating Isabelle since they started high school. They look so cute together...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MOOOOOOOOM!&quot; Sarah protested, as Rachel managed to stifle a chuckle, noting that jokes at who the children were dating wasn&#39;t limited to her own mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any way, Erica and I had the money for a procedure that would let us conceive and no sex with a man would be needed,&quot; Laura spoke, &quot;as Moon Lake&#39;s doctors have been able to provide for artificial insemination. All we had to do was let them know how many we wanted to carry and let us take our pick from sperm donors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We ultimately picked the same donor, so that our daughters biologically have the same father,&quot; Erica explained, &quot;and we&#39;ve loved our daughters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel smiled at that. It was something that made her glad to see others happy and friendly. It was something that gave her other recognition on how she was reacting to the present pride&#39;s environment and further making Rachel wonder on why she&#39;d resisted Cynthia&#39;s request to at least meet with the various Moon Lake prides earlier. As she&#39;d gotten a lot out of the meeting and found things to be fairly friendly and informative, which wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all great,&quot; Rachel managed a small smile, &quot;hopefully... when I&#39;ve gotten everything behind me with what my former girlfriend did... have found a pride to join, and maybe met a woman I could share my life with, we could discuss something like that. But that&#39;d all be something for the future for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Laura nodded, &quot;though for the moment, every pride would be more than happy to help you gain control over transformations... all of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m looking forward to that,&quot; Rachel spoke, &quot;but I&#39;d like to be able to go with Cynthia to meet the other prides first before I make any decision on what pride to join. Though, I would wish to ask on if there was anything I could practice improving my control while checking around. As I&#39;m sure I may run into other werecats on other days... and I don&#39;t want to just transform because a part of my instincts overpowers everything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well for me... it was a lot of practice,&quot; Erica spoke, &quot;which Laura was happy to offer, and I was glad to receive. Though, while you&#39;re looking into which prides to join... you could work on some meditation and related mental techniques.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean like a mantra?&quot; Rachel raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something like that could work and help,&quot; Julia commented, &quot;it&#39;s often part of just about any new were&#39;s gaining control. Often... it&#39;s something that&#39;s done in conjunction with working with the pride they join, but it&#39;s something that can work. Mine was &quot;I want to be me,&quot; and it worked, even when many times... I feel like my were form IS the REAL me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel looked down for a moment, and only looked up when she saw Cynthia&#39;s soft hands take her paw-like hands in a tender grip. The line was something that related to one of the things that Rachel had most often resisted. She had control over her transformations and knew she could change whenever she wanted, and sometimes even did in private, if only to try and debate with herself over who the REAL Rachel Covaks was now. But more often than not, she&#39;d decided her human form was the real here and never fully felt comfortable in her werecat form, because it was a reminder of what Leslie did. A lot of that hadn&#39;t necessarily gone, but Jessica saying she was pretty and the words that assured her that she would never be like Leslie had brought new thoughts to the back of Rachel&#39;s mind. Thoughts that were more accepting of the anthropomorphic Black Cat form she was presently sporting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Accepting a lot of that for me has been rough,&quot; Rachel admitted, &quot;given everything. Though... talking with you...&quot; she paused to look over to Cynthia, &quot;and finding a true friend who&#39;s done a lot for me... and in ways that would go beyond just a student advisor... that actually helps...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just know that you&#39;ll never be like the one who turned you,&quot; Linus told her with a warm smile, &quot;being a werecat... accepting being a werecat, doesn&#39;t mean liking the one who took your choices away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And never doubt that you have friends here,&quot; Cynthia added, &quot;even Mace, who can be a bit grumpy and protective at times... is a good person and once you have his trust, even as a weredog, he will always have your back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Cynthia,&quot; Rachel managed, &quot;thank you all.&quot;</p>
