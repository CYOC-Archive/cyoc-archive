<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Everything alright in here?” A voice said, opening the door. In walked Ellie’s mom, checking up on the two. James’ smirk did not disappear, Ellie began to anticipate whatever James was going to do,<br />
“Don’t…” Ellie said, looking James in the eyes. He continued to smirk,<br />
“I wish your mom’s boobs were the size of her head,” he said with a chuckle,<br />
“What’s going on honey?” Ellie mom asked, looking as if she hadn’t heard anything James had just said, “I thought James was going to leave about half-an-hour ago?” She was failing to see her shirt already rising under the increasing mass of her chest. Ellie was about to undo the wish before James said,<br />
“This is fair!”<br />
“Ugh…” Ellie said, “at least… I wish mom’s clothes would grow with her,”<br />
“Am I missing something here?” Ellie’s mom asked, very puzzled by this all,<br />
“Sorry Ms White,” James said, “we’re just playing a game,”<br />
“Even as adults you still continue to play games together. So adorable,” she said. Looking at her chest, her breasts were swelling to the size of melons, and they were still growing. And somehow, she had absolutely no idea what was going on,<br />
“That’s weird,” Ellie said,<br />
“What’s weird?” her mom asked,<br />
“N-nothing…”<br />
“Ms White?” James started,<br />
“Please sweetie, I’ve told you to just call me Claire,”<br />
“Right, do you feel any different right now, Claire?” James asked,<br />
“No,” Claire replied, “why?”<br />
“Nothing, I just wish your butt was at least twice as big as it is now,”<br />
“What did you say again?” Claire asked, mishearing everything James had said, “I know you said something but it just didn’t go into my ear,” she smiled,<br />
“Interesting…” James said, “it wasn’t important,”<br />
“Seriously?” Ellie asked, “you owe me big time,”<br />
“You’ve owed me for about six years!” James said, “besides, let’s just have fun with this!”<br />
“Fun?” Ellie said, disappointed that James considered this fun, but not surprised. With no other excuse, and granted he was right about owing him, she decided to just play along, “I guess… I wish my mom’s body was slimmed and toned,”<br />
“Yes!” James yelled, “I wish her hips were wide and her thighs were thick!”<br />
“Ugh, and I wish her waist was narrow like a models,”<br />
“I wish her hair was a perfect blonde,”<br />
“I wish her lips were plump,” Ellie said, chuckling to herself afterwards, clearly having more fun than she realised,<br />
“Oh! I wish…” James said, struggling to find something else to change.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I think I’m in the middle of something here,” Claire said, “I can’t focus on anything either of you are saying right now,” she confessed.<br />
Both James and Ellie looked up at her, finally taking in everything after being distracted for a few moments. Her body, still in the process of growing, was unreal to look at! Her waist was so thin it looked like Jessica Rabbit, her breasts were so big she looked as if she’d stuck two balloons in her blouse. Her butt, her hips, her waist, they looked cartoonish on the rest of her body. Her lips like a pornstar, her hair like a princess. She looked completely unrealistic,<br />
“M-mom…” Ellie said, her mouth wide open as she took in her mothers body,<br />
“Really Ellie?” Claire groaned, “I’ve told you so many times to get your eyes off my breasts!” She said sternly, then quickly looked at James, “sorry my dear, I don’t mean to embarrass you,”<br />
“No problem Claire,” James said, “I wish you were wearing a bikini instead of underwear,”<br />
“Ugh…” Ellie said, facepalming herself,<br />
<br />
“Your sister is going to be here in about an hour, so let me know if James is staying or going tonight,”<br />
“I’ll be leaving at some point in the next hour Ms Wh— Claire!” He corrected himself, smiling. Trying his absolute best not to look at her breasts,<br />
“Good to hear. I’m sure I’ll see you tomorrow after school as well,”<br />
“Of course,” James said, smiling as she started to leave the room,<br />
“And Ellie,” she stopped, turning around to face her daughter. She leant forwards, showing off her deep cleavage and the outline of her brightly coloured bikini underneath her blouse, “I expect you to be downstairs and talking to your sister. You know she really loves you and you need to commit yourself to talking to her.” She said sternly. Ellie’s mood was immediately ruined, she sat herself against her wall as Claire turned around and left the room. James wanted to do nothing but stare at Claire’s ass, but he knew bigger things were at stake.<br />
<br />
“Just ignore it,” he said, “you can talk to her,”<br />
“But why would I want to,” Ellie said rhetorically, “she’s just me, but better. Someone who’s gonna do something with her life and become successful and make all the money she wants with whoever the hell she marries, while I just wanna do art and shit… it’s bullshit,”<br />
“Then why don’t you mess with her?”<br />
“Mess with her?” Ellie asked,<br />
“Yeah!” James said, “your mom told me I’ve gotta go, which I totally understand, but you’ve got the whole evening to make any wish you want,”<br />
“But if you’re not here then…”<br />
“Just text me!” James said, “we’ve both got cellphones. You tell me when, I’ll make a throwaway wish, and then you can do whatever you want!”<br />
“Y-yeah…” Ellie said, a smile appearing on her face, “yeah! I can do that!”<br />
“Exactly!”<br />
“But before you go,” Ellie started, “you owe me. Big time,”<br />
“Hey I thought all that was paying for it?”<br />
“It was, up until the bikini,” Ellie said, “your mistake,”<br />
“Unfair… but sure whatever, then I’m gonna hit the road,” he said, ready for whatever Ellie was going to throw at him,<br />
“Okay. I wish James has a big bubble butt that bounces with every step he takes!”<br />
“Oh c’mon…” James said,<br />
“And you can’t wish it away until at least tomorrow!” Ellie demanded, “that’s the punishment! It’s totally fair,”<br />
“Alright alright,” James said. He could already feel the pressure in his butt, expanding against his jeans, “this is so uncool,” he said, placing his hands on his rear,<br />
“Turn around!” Ellie said. James groaned, turning himself around. His butt was getting bigger and rounder, bubblier by the second. By the time it was finished, James’ butt was at least the size of a football. Sitting on it would definitely lift him a few inches higher. It was firmer than it used to be, but luckily it didn’t tear his jeans.<br />
<br />
“Are we done now?” James asked,<br />
“Yeah we’re done,” Ellie said with a smirk on her face.<br />
As James carefully leant down to grab his bag, Ellie stood up and slapped his ass!<br />
“EH!” James yelped, jumping to attention. He spun around and pointed a finger at Ellie, but hesitated, “y-y’know… if I did that to you it’d be problematic!”<br />
“I know,” Ellie said, laughing. James joined in laughing as well.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Ellie walked James to the door, standing behind him to take in every bounce his butt gave. She waved as he carefully walked down the street and past the corner. She smirked at him.<br />
“Is James gone now?” Claire asked from the kitchen,<br />
“Yeah he is,”<br />
“Good to hear, you can help me with dinner before your sister arrives,” Claire groaned, “I wish dinner was already prepared!” She said to herself with a smug look on her face. But nothing. She thought for a moment, “shit…” she said to herself, “it’s not my wish…”<br />
“Ellie!” Claire yelled, “come and help me!” She demanded.<br />
<br />
With no way to deviate, she slumped her way to the kitchen. It was going to be a long night…</p>
