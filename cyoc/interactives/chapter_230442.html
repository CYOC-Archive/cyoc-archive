<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To my surprised Mrs. Brockman grabbed by wrist, the look she gave me conveyed her intentions. <i>We need to talk.</i> I also noticed Monique with us as Mrs. Brockman led us out of sight. She led us up the stairs to the second floor to a spot I knew so well.<br />
<br />
Given I’ve been in the Brockman Mansion before it was a place where Mrs. Brockman likes to overlook her guest without being heard. A perfect place where people can see us but without them hearing us.<br />
<br />
“I take it that this is about Monique being eighteen now?” I asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes I’m wondering if you made this permanent yet?” Mrs. Brockman asked. I took a breath to clear my mind. I knew that the best option right now is to tell the truth.<br />
<br />
“Not yet.” I answered causing Monique to look at me. “I haven’t decide on how to make Monique change’s permanent. I can do it with a snap of my finger but I decided to wait.” Oddly enough Mrs. Brockman smiled.<br />
<br />
“Good that gives us time to plan things out.” Mrs. Brockman said causing the two of us to look at her. She looked at Monique with a look as if she was a friend, ironic given how she treated Monique for the past year. “Monique, you don’t know this but I’m a friend of your father.”<br />
<br />
“Papa!?!” Monique exclaimed with Mrs. Brockman nodding her head.<br />
<br />
“Yes, he was ashamed that he allowed himself to pay your way through college and despite how good you were you couldn’t find a job in the States.” Explain Mrs. Brockman. Monique hung her head in shame as Mrs. Brockman continued. “He contribute this to not making you get a job when you were in college so you could learn life management skills. So he reached out to me and a plan had been agreed.” Monique perked up when she heard that.<br />
<br />
“Originally I hired you as a maid so you can learn time and life management skills as well as how to work under an unbearable boss. After three years of working for me I would have recommend you to a company that paid well and provide board and food.” Mrs. Brockman said surprising Monique. “Now this situation present with us with a unique opportunity to correct one of your major mistakes.” It clicked in my mind.<br />
<br />
“At her age she can be graduating High School and going to college.” I started.<br />
<br />
“With my knowledge I breezed through college while working part time!” Monique finished. Mrs. Brockman nodded.<br />
<br />
“And I have the perfect plan for Monique’s new life. She is a foreign exchange student that I’m hosting. My youngest is interested in French culture so she can be the exchange student.” Mrs. Brockman announce as Monique looked excited. I on the other hand questions and concerns.<br />
<br />
“What about Jessica? I made so she was always your maid but do you feel guilty about that permanent change?” I asked but to my surprised she shrugged.<br />
<br />
“I don’t care mostly because I believed she is a bad fit and influenced on Brad. I mean where were they for half the show?” Asked Mrs. Brockman.<br />
<br />
‘Don’t remind me.’ I muttered however to our surprised Monique look like she knew something.<br />
<br />
“I know where they were.” Monique said as Mrs. Brockman looked at her with curiosity. “They were fucking…in Brad’s room…with no protection.” She said rubbing her arm. “Despite the fact that Jessica is now older than him and not his girlfriend anymore.”<br />
<br />
I was dumb struct as I look down to see the party going on downstairs. I spotted Brad having a grin as he found my ‘gift’ to him. He spotted me and wave back as if to thank me. I then spotted Jessica doing her duties but now I noticed that she seem to be glowing; the type of glowing a person would have after having sex.<br />
<br />
“And how would you know this?” Asked Mrs. Brockman in curiosity.<br />
<br />
“I believe it was that Enfoiré plan to fuck a maid on his 18th birthday and I was to be his unfortunate target before you made me eighteen.” Monique said again rubbing her arm.<br />
<br />
“Now that you mention it your uniform was more risqué than usual.” Mrs. Brockman comment not going to comment of the whole ‘enfoiré’ remark.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I had to change one thing about it. The underwear. It…was crotchless. Based on Jessica’s comment she immediately changed into them then came back to give Brad his ‘present’.” Monique answered and that got me mad. The same emotion seem to go through Mrs. Brockman who calmed down.<br />
<br />
“That will not do. I can’t have a perverted son who violates the ‘see not touch’ rule me and Tim establish for our children when we hire good looking men and women. Even on his birthday.” Mrs. Brockman said firmly.<br />
<br />
“What is the worse you can do?” I asked now fully on board to make Brad’s life miserable. Friendship be damn.<br />
<br />
“The best I can do is kick him out once he graduated high school. I could bump it up to disownment now due to the fact Becky gave me a grandson but I would need a strong reason.” Mrs. Brockman answered. An idea came to my mind.<br />
<br />
“What if the violation of the ‘see not touch’ rule results in a pregnancy?” I asked and Mrs. Brockman smiled.<br />
<br />
“That would work plus it gives me a reason to fire Jessica and put them in one of the many apartments that me & Tim use for our escapades. Then make them defend for themselves. However that would be too simple. Don’t you want him gone as soon as possible?” Asked Mrs. Brockman. This put me in a bit uncomfortable by her question.<br />
<br />
“Well there is a trick involving turning a guy into a statue but change my mind when I pick Hank. I can rework it into a party game. Then at the end of the night permanent make him a statue but isn’t that a bit harsh?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I agree it is a bit too harsh.” Monique said.<br />
<br />
“Either way it is your choice Joey.” Mrs. Brockman said. Welp the choice is mine.</p>
