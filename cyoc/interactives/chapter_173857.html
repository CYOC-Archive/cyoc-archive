<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Did- ... did you s-say ... shower? With ... you?&quot; For a moment Jeff thought he was having a brain malfunction, and he must have misheard her, but then ... she nodded.<br />
<br />
Yes, he&#39;d heard her correctly.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you ... wanted?&quot; Her jitters were as bad as his own, and she began to backtrack immediately, talking very quickly out of fright, her diatribe peppered with nervous laughter, clearly fearing she&#39;d made a big mistake. &quot;It&#39;s- ... it&#39;s okay. You don&#39;t, um, have to. Actually, don&#39;t worry. I- ... um, I don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m a slut or anything. Haha! M-Maybe you should just forget it! Nevermind, I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Jeff found his voice, despite the shock, and interrupted with a quick exclamation. &quot;Brianna ... you AREN&#39;T like that! I- ... I&#39;d like to, uh ... s-shower with you. Really!&quot; He took a deep breath, and they stared at one another, their mutual outbursts calming in tandem. &quot;No, make that: I&#39;d LOVE to, but I just- ... why? You know what I did to myself.&quot; He frowned, and gestured with some frustration to his groin, the slight bulge of his crotch-breast easily identifiable. &quot;I&#39;m just a f-freak, who can&#39;t give you what you a real boy could!&quot; Looking down, feeling ashamed, he couldn&#39;t make eye contact. &quot;You deserve someone who can treat you properly!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff.&quot; He felt Brianna take his hand, and he looked up. She was smiling shyly, but her face was red too, like she was ... embarrassed? &quot;It&#39;s just temporary right, but what if ... I like you as you are either way?&quot; She bit her lip. &quot;Um, you see, I&#39;ve never even seen a naked guy our age before. Some of my school friends have boyfriends who are kinda weird and gross. The thought of hard dicks and being around horny immature perverts is very intimidating, and offputting. But you? You&#39;re cute, and friendly, and smart, and- ... and fun! Most of all, um-&quot;, she paused taking a deep breath, &quot;-you don&#39;t have a penis. I liked you before I knew what had happened, but, uh, I hope this doesn&#39;t discourage you, but ... I feel even safer with you now. You&#39;re not going to try anything nasty, and being near you? Knowing how you are? Nobody else is like you! I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a freak! I- ... I like it! It makes me curious to see more.&quot; Her grip on Jeff&#39;s hand tightened a little, and her voice lowered. &quot;Really really curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I- ... t-truly? That&#39;s how you feel?&quot; He was more shocked by this admission than her initial offer of showering together. She thought he was fun? Smart? Cute?!<br />
<br />
She was ... curious ... about him, like this?!?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Standing, Brianna tugged gently on his hand, her confidence building again, and she pulled him with her. &quot;Come on. Let&#39;s go upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leading him, they walked through the house. Jeff was following along in a daze, like a lost puppy, and when they made it into the bathroom by Brianna&#39;s room, she let go. First, she retrieved a couple of fluffy bath towels from a wall cupboard. Then she turned the shower cubicle&#39;s water on and laid the towels on the counter edge, before coming back to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, while the water heats up,&quot; she took his arm and dragged a stunned and disoriented Jeff next to the frosted glass shower door, &quot;we should get ready. If you take off your shirt,&quot; her voice dropped to a nervous whisper, &quot;I&#39;ll take off mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all the prompting he needed to wakeup. Spurred into action, Jeff stripped away his upper layer, just a tee, his hoodie already discarded during ping-pong in the basement. Imitating him, Brianna slowly pulled her own top over her head, then without any hesitation, reached behind and unclipped her bra.<br />
<br />
Wow!<br />
<br />
Jeff was above regular height, tall for his age, and she was just on the average, a little shorter than him, with wavy red-brown hair that was usually tied back in a spotless ponytail. She had a light frame, fit from the physical exercise he knew she enjoyed -- swimming, soccer, badminton, ping-pong -- but her breasts? They were anything but average -- smaller than his own, as she said, but not by much -- and rounder, more perky than he had expected. It was better than his fantasies, and he realised he was staring too long, when she flushed red in self-consciousness.<br />
<br />
After everything Brianna had done for him, he wasn&#39;t going to make her uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Taking the initiative, Jeff locked eyes with her and undid his pants, going first for the next part of their disrobing. As the garment dropped to the floor, he freed the material of his cup, and the pink lace slid down his legs, leaving him naked and exposed. Still a little nervous but in an excited way for what was happening, his breast shook momentarily, jiggling as he stood up straight. In response, she slipped off her sweatpants, followed by panties, and he was treated to her naked bottom half. Jeff wanted to look, but the awkwardness of the situation and her trust of him not to be a creep turned that into only a glance, a quick scanning. Though he wanted to see more of her, he was still fascinated by her curves. Her build was slim but wonderfully delightfully rounded in a healthy way, without any excess flab. He stopped himself from gawking too much, and she was also grabbing him again, and pulling them both inside the shower.<br />
<br />
Standing together under the hot water, almost close enough to touch, Jeff shared a long slow look with the girl he had a huge crush on. They smiled at each other, and Brianna took a handful of liquid soap from the dispenser, and spread it all over his chest. Her fingers felt wonderful as she rubbed it into his pectoral muscles, and the two kept making eye contact while she washed him. Then, Brianna placed his hand onto the dispenser, giving him a very big hint.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your turn,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
Swallowing, feeling bold, creative, he pumped the soap and then slathered it across her breasts. She let out a quiet sigh as it went onto her, and he marveled at the touch -- how squishy, how well proportioned and slippery-smooth they were. Jeff had the urge to lower his head a little and put his lips on them, but instead, he lightly squeezed, then slid his hands around her back and down, pulling her closer.<br />
<br />
Brianna&#39;s breasts squishing into his chest were magical -- soft, and wet, and cushioned. She tilted her head back and leaned in, and they kissed, quick but sensual and electric. His hands followed the curve of her butt, still slick with suds, and down, running over the back of her thighs. Still in awe at the midway combination of sturdy muscle, and the rounder fatter softness of her boobs and lower half, Jeff had found some kind of heaven. Their tongues rubbed together, the kiss only lingering briefly before she broke it off. Then his hands were retracing the path back up her body, reveling in every inch of understated shapely feminine perfection, how she was both yielding and firm at once.<br />
<br />
Between them, Jeff could feel his nipple tingling with pure concentrated excitement, and his single one below was the counterpoint to the enchantment of her two above. Pressed against Brianna while they embraced, just under her navel, Jeff&#39;s breast had been rubbing her flawless smooth skin. As they parted, he was becoming very excited and it was swelling gently, more stimulated than ever. Jeff knew Brianna could tell, and she give a little giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;My turn!&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking more liquid soap, she crouched, much as she had when they were in the bra shop&#39;s changing room, taking position right in front of him. Almost like she was pretending to do an examination, she was leaning in close, with Jeff only able to watch, his mouth hanging slightly open in amazement. Grasping it from both sides, she began to massage the soap into his breast, and he felt the nub harden even more, the body of it continuing to enlarge with successive trembling pulses. Brianna covered every atom of the surface with dedication -- from running her fingertips over where it extended from his abdomen, to around and into the gap where it was plumping close to his thighs, to beneath where it was thickening between his legs proper. She paused there, cupping it, lifting it lightly, as if to test the weight. He could feel it continue to engorge, gradually fattening, even as it rested on her hand, his arousal slowly but constantly building from all the attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like this, right? I- ... I can feel you enjoying it, and, um ... I want to see -- if you&#39;ll let me -- what happens when you- ...&quot; She trailed off, glancing up, her implication clear and look asking permission, and Jeff swallowed, nodding mutely, too blown away to comment at all.<br />
<br />
He instinctively spread his legs a little more, his stance wider, and a little voice in his brain was murmuring to him that &#39;Brianna is jerking you off!&#39; and he couldn&#39;t deny it. It was becoming heavier, the base wider than it had ever been -- outside of last Sunday&#39;s overfilled urination after the park -- and Jeff was still going. Beading water trickled down the sides, viscous soapy residue crawling with it in rivulets around the breast&#39;s protruding bulge, and Brianna brushed back her sodden hair with one hand, the other still fully holding Jeff&#39;s burgeoning &#39;erection&#39;. Her fingers strummed where it sat, tickling the underside, and she bounced it gently in place. The entire swollen mass bobbed and shimmered in what seemed like perfect slow-motion to him, and the feeling of its heft pulling, lightly tugging, across the entire front of his groin was indescribable. It created a weird pleasurable spark inside him, that shot throughout the distended flesh and across his lower body like lightning.<br />
<br />
She repeated it again, bouncing him, the spark of sexual excitement bursting in response, and then adding on a sliding motion, her hands coming together to squeeze forward along the breast&#39;s length to the nipple. Then a third time -- another bounce-squeeze combo, having found what worked -- followed by a fourth, and a fifth. Jeff was beginning to huff and groan at each little jolt of Brianna&#39;s masturbation, completely involuntarily, and her eyes kept skipping from the fattened breast in front of her to the expressions he was forced to make, not wanting to miss the effect it was having. She was flushed pink with the shower&#39;s heat and a subtle excitement, but he was making reflexive faces from her manipulations, totally unable to stop himself.<br />
<br />
It was TOO good!<br />
<br />
She was hitting a rhythm -- a sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth bounce-squeeze -- and Jeff grunted out, trying to fit some words in between each stroke of the the most incredible handjob he had ever thought possible in his life. Just before the twelfth he managed to moan a warning, only seconds before it happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-Brianna!&quot; He gasped, his thighs and ass and abs and calves all beginning to tense, nearly cramping, &quot;I&#39;m-... I&#39;m going to-&quot;<br />
<br />
Her final stroke landed, and somehow anticipating what was coming, both hands went to the base of the organ, much bigger than earlier, and Brianna began to milk him in smooth, firm, caresses. Jeff&#39;s mouth dropped open in stupefaction, and a low raspy &#39;oooohhhhhhh&#39; of sexual freedom came out of his throat, at the same time as milk began to squirt forcefully from his nipple. Neither the liquid, nor the sound, nor the soaring floating joy of release seemed about to stop, the flow splashing directly over her cleavage. Creamy white rivers of it poured over her own breasts while he watched, stuck in a wonderful loop of orgasmic moaning and milking, all his reactions extending, boosting in magnitude, each time she repeated the coaxing massage around his breast.<br />
<br />
Finally, she stopped, letting go of the spongey softness of his flesh, drained again to its regular size, and she climbed upright, eyes like saucers from taking in the whole event. His milk was still pouring down the sides of her body, running over stomach and hips and her beautiful thighs, washing away in the spray. Jeff was panting like they&#39;d played another round of ping-pong, and Brianna&#39;s eyes were shining with a new appreciation for him that was breathless and eager.<br />
<br />
Turning the water off, she led him back out of he cubicle, and Jeff followed, docile and scatterbrained, still coming down from one of the greatest experiences of his life thus far. While he tried to draw his thoughts together, she began to towel them both off, careful and slow, and taking extra care to pat down his sensitive groin area after such an explosive moment.<br />
<br />
The next clear memory Jeff had was of her sliding his bra up his thighs and lovingly fitting it back into place, the soft lacy trim coming to rest where it belonged -- where he needed it -- between his legs. As a last gesture, almost like a thank you, Brianna kissed his belly-button, and then playfully shoved Jeff&#39;s shirt and pants into his hands, while she began to dress herself.<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t talk while they finished up in the bathroom, and she grabbed the towels, tossing them into a heated rack in the corner, and then took his hand, once again. He loved that she was so willing to touch him, but it was only a short trip into her bedroom, where she plopped down onto the bed, drawing Jeff to sit next to her. As soon as he was in place, she leaned into him, her head on his shoulder, and cuddled in close.<br />
<br />
&quot;That- ... that was SO fucking amazing!&quot; Quiet, but very passionate, her impression was undoubtable. &quot;I- ... I wasn&#39;t expecting you to make milk, but I&#39;m glad it was that instead of ... anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I should be saying that to YOU.&quot; Jeff still felt like he was recovering, his limbs a little like they were made of jelly, and his mind kinda foggy. He was warm, and very relaxed, the same as after the best orgasms he&#39;d known before, but being milked? It beat that. He couldn&#39;t even lie to himself about it anymore. &quot;That was out of this world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you want your dick back again, but this has all been a rush.&quot; Jeff could hear the smile in her voice, the tenderness to it. &quot;It feels nice to know you were okay sharing that with me. Letting me do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; It was all he could think of as an answer. He didn&#39;t have anything witty to add.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re back to school tomorrow, right?&quot; Brianna sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t mind classes, but sometimes I wish ours were co-ed like yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wish you went to my school, Jeff thought to himself, but he didn&#39;t have the courage to say it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What day are you gonna switch back -- it was Wednesday I think you said?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, Wednesday.&quot; He agreed. &quot;In the afternoon after I get home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t sure, but he almost thought there was a note of ... disappointment? There wasn&#39;t a lot of time to contemplate why she might be feeling that though, because Brianna continued to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate that my family is gonna be back soon. You wanna meet up some time in the near future?&quot; There was apprehension in her voice now, but also hope. She gripped his forearm where her hand was resting on it as they snuggled, and lightly squeezed. &quot;I know maybe it sounds weird to say, but, um ... we&#39;re both mature enough to be honest, right? We used to know each other better and we&#39;re still learning, but .... I want this to be ... something more. D&#39;you ... want that too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Was she suggesting- ... ?!?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I- ... I do. I&#39;d like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Jeff felt her nod against his arm. &quot;So, um, if- ... if you&#39;re willing to ... maybe we should plan something this week, or next weekend?&quot;</p>
