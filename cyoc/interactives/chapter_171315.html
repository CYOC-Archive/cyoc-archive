<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike woke slightly disorientated. Why was she was in her mothers bed? It was only when she looked in the mirror as she hurried to the toilet that she recalled she was no longer Mary&#39;s twin. Instead she was her own mother.<br />
<br />
Having done her business and being relieved to see she hadn&#39;t leaked she spent some time gazing at her reflection. Mom was actually a very good looking woman but to Mike she was &quot;old&quot;. The reflection Mike was looking at had wrinkles around her eyes and her dark roots were showing in her blonde hair. At the same she was filling out the chemise she was in very nicely. Sharon&#39;s breasts were still firm and perky. She could see why Mike&#39;s friends at his old school had referred to his Mom as a MILF.<br />
<br />
However one thing Mike quickly recalled was that she had been in this body for over 12 hours. She could become herself again. With that thought she hurried out of the room and down the hallway to what had been her room when she was Mike. There sleeping on what had been Mike&#39;s bed was a teenage girl who Mike assumed was the real Sharon.<br />
<br />
&#39;Mom! Wake up! We can change back now. Where is the medallion?&#39;<br />
<br />
The girl stirred. Then looked at Mike. &#39;Why are you calling me Mom, Mom?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh... I just assumed. Why are you in my bed Mary?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m not Mary. I&#39;m Michelle. Can&#39;t you tell your own daughters apart?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;What? What are you talking about?&#39; Mike was alarmed<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s alright Mike. I&#39;m just teasing. It interesting to see what my face looks like when I&#39;m confused. Yes I&#39;m your Mum. Give me a minute and I&#39;ll get the medallion and we can swap back&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;We are not swapping back. I don&#39;t want that body. I want to be my old male self&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Fair enough. I must say I have enjoyed this experience. I like this body. It&#39;s good to feel young again&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Hurry up Mom&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Pick out some clothes from your wardrobe that you are sure will change you back to your true self. I&#39;ll fetch the medallion and meet you back in my ensuite&#39;<br />
<br />
The apparent Michelle left the room. Mike opened his own wardrobe. He wasn&#39;t sure exactly how the medallion worked. While in this body was it safe to even touch the clothes? Maybe the safest thing was to wait until she had the medallion then touch it directly to the clothes she want to use?&#39; She identified a shirt &quot;Mike&quot; had worn last week. But had Mom hung the shirt up? Would her doing that mean that she had somehow contaminated the clothes?<br />
<br />
She went back to the master bedroom to see &quot;Michelle&quot; inspecting the contents of Mom&#39;s wardrobe. She didn&#39;t seem concerned that she was touching everything. <br />
<br />
&#39;What are you looking for Mom?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Probably best that you call me Michelle when I look like this, but to answer your question I&#39;m looking for something I haven&#39;t worn recently. I just realized this is an opportunity to shed a few years. I&#39;m thinking being 30 again would be nice. Yes this is what I was after&#39; She pulled out a black dress then explained. &#39;I wore this at your grandfather&#39;s funeral and can&#39;t remember wearing it since. That would be 7 years ago. I&#39;m very glad I resisted the temptation to throw it out&#39; <br />
<br />
Mike decided Sharon could go first. That way she could see whether &quot;Michelle&quot; taking the dress out of the wardrobe was enough to contaminate it. &#39;You go first Michelle&#39; Mike decided she may as well indulge the true Sharon.<br />
<br />
&#39;Why thank you &quot;Mom&quot;. You were in such a great hurry only minutes ago&#39; <br />
<br />
Mike blushed &#39;I just don&#39;t want to make another mistake&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well here goes then&#39; Mike watched as Michelle picked up the medallion from her handbag and touched it to the black dress &#39;Ouch! I suppose that&#39;s a good sign&#39; &quot;Michelle&quot; then moved to in front of the full length mirror in anticipation of watching her change. <br />
<br />
Within a minute they could both see the magic was working. &quot;Michelle&#39;s&quot; hair began to lighten then her features began to change. Confident that things were going as planned. Mike picked up the medallion and returned to her own room. There she touched the medallion to the shirt she had identified earlier. She felt a zap like static electricity and was pleased. She had learnt that was a sign that the medallion was working. Satisfied she returned to Sharon&#39;s room to watch the changes in the full length mirror.<br />
<br />
In the few minutes that Mike had been absent &quot;Michelle&quot; had changed further. She now looked more mature and was clearly becoming Sharon once more. Mike detected her own first changes. Her dark roots appeared to be getting more prominent. She was happy about that. And her face was starting to change as well. <br />
<br />
After 10 minutes she still looked very feminine but her facial features were starting to change. She still had breasts, although they seemed to be slightly smaller, and as of yet nothing was growing down below where it counted. For a moment she was suddenly fearful that she was turning back into a copy Mary, who by then had joined them and was watching the changes as well. Mike was still wearing Sharon&#39;s chemise so that didn&#39;t exactly help her to look masculine.<br />
<br />
Indeed the changes had been going on for 20 minutes before Mike finally felt confident that he was becoming himself once more. The breasts had shrunk further and he could feel a lump in his groin, his hips narrowed and his brown hair began to shorten and resemble his own shaggy cut.<br />
<br />
The last 5 minutes was bliss for Mike. He couldn&#39;t help but cradle his newly returned penis in his hands and was pleased as the panties he had been wearing became uncomfortable. They didn&#39;t have room to accommodate his newly returned testicles.<br />
<br />
It was only when the newly returned 29 year old Sharon said &#39;Mike. I think perhaps you should find some of your own clothes to put on&#39; that he was aware that he was still wearing his mother&#39;s chemise. He no longer filled it out. Embarrassed he raced back to his own room.<br />
<br />
Dressed in his familiar t-shirt and jeans he returned to find Mom explaining to Mary how she had cleverly made herself younger. Indeed the wrinkles near her eyes were virtually non-existent.  &#39;And we saw the other day with Michelle how I could use the medallion to enhance my bust. I&#39;m thinking I might move up one bra size tonight. Maybe I could find a way to grow a couple of inches as well. This medallion is presenting us with so many possibilities&#39; <br />
<br />
Sharon and Mary finally noticed Mike. &#39;So you are finally back to being yourself. I&#39;m hoping your weekend has given you a bit of an understanding what it is like to be female. How did you find the experience?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well now that I am myself once more I can describe it as interesting. I was a bit worried for a while that I would never see my mate again&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Boys and their penises. That&#39;s all they think about&#39; said Mary<br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe you should try having one for a while Mary&#39; suggested Mom &#39;I might even have a go myself. The possibilities are endless&#39;</p>
