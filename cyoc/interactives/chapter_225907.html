<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a cold November Sunday morning as the grizzled weathered man stood on the platform of the conning tower looking towards the vanishing Ireland coastline. The submarine he was commanding was a Los Angeles Class Nuclear submarine; one of the twenty three remaining in a fleet that once numbered sixty two. His vessel was slated to be mothballed and decommissioned as soon as it return to its port; currently in Norfolk Virginia.<br />
“I’m going to miss these views,” the captain muttering as he climbed down and secured the latch as he entered the bridge. It was a cramped space without windows, viewports or anyway to navigate by sight save for the periscope. Most of the equipment is classified, but thanks to spies that the navy was too embarrassed to admit they had running about; just about everything of his outdated sub was now in the public domain. Turning to his exo; a young man with a sandy blonde hair trim so close to his scalp, you could mistake him for a raw recruit in the marines.  The man despite his youth was becoming a rising star in the navy. The captain knew the young sailor was bucking for a command of his own. While he had nothing against the man’s ambition, he did find his treatment towards the crew to be a bit abrasive.<br />
<br />
“New orders,” The exo presenting the slip of paper to the captain; “we are to make haste to Virginia.”<br />
“The orders may be new to you,” the captain taking the slip of paper and confirming its contents; “but I have known about these orders since the start of our six month deployment.” The Captain was about to issue the orders when he had an idea come across his head.<br />
“Since you are getting a transfer after leave,” the captain handing the papers back to his first officer; “you post the orders and plot the course,” the captain inspecting the equipment and noting its well cleaned condition; “you need the hours for your captain’s promotion.”<br />
“That is true,” the exo nodding; “I’ll get on it.”<br />
“Make sure you schedule the fire drills a half hour after shift change,” the captain observing the officer plotting his course; “I want the sailors to remain on their toes up until port.”<br />
“Yes sir,” the exo nodding; “anything else?”<br />
“I’ll be in my cabin if you need me,” The captain taking a deep breath before exhaling; noting the fresh air being pumped into their vessel prior to diving; “Perhaps we should spend some of the return home on the surface of the Atlantic ocean. No use in breathing recycled air all the way home.”<br />
“I’ll let the crew know,” the exo responding as he got on the coms and started issuing dive orders.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Several hours later and at least 200 meter below the ocean surface, the captain and several of the officer watch were eating a simple meal of pork chops with potatoes and diced carrots. News of the subs decommissioning spread quick when the exo posted the orders. Several expressed disappointment that they would soon be separated and posted at different vessels and/or ports. A few were set to retire; the captain was being re-assigned to a desk job.<br />
“Well at least we get to spend Thanksgiving with family,” one officer breaking the melancholy that hung in the air; “my wife will at least be happy to see me for a change.”<br />
“Congrats,” another officer grumbling; “you’re still married, unlike some of us.”<br />
“Enough belly aching,” the captain interjecting; “or you can join the engine crew as they perform a surprise fire drill in the reactor room.”<br />
That silenced the despondent officers. Despite not liking the eventual break up of their floating community under the sea; no one wanted to be volunteered to assist in what could be a dangerous duty.<br />
<br />
“Is it just me,” a junior officer tugging at his uniform collar; “or is it hot in here?”<br />
“I’m feeling a bit warm as well,” another officer chiming in; he gets up to check the nearby ventilation grille. Feeling the cold air flowing he shrugs his shoulders as the air conditioning is working.<br />
“What about you captain,” the officer sitting back down; “are you feeling a bit hot?”<br />
“I am,” the captain sighing as he finishes his coffee; “if you are all done eating, then go take a cold shower and change into a fresh uniform;  it should help.”<br />
“Perhaps we should surface to flush the air,” another officer chiming; “It’s not as it the Chinese or the Russians can glean anymore intelligence off of our vessel if we surface.”<br />
“I’ll take it under advisement,” the captain getting up and placing his soiled dishware in the appropriate bin for the galley to clean. “See you all on the bridge in an hour.”<br />
<br />
After the shower in his quarters the captain was feeling a bit better; infact he felt even better as soon as he threw off the towel he wore around his waist after drying off. His high temperature was due to the fact that the air circulating in the sub was infected with the fury virus; the amount was small and took a while to fully take root. But now that it had a chance to replicate with in him; it began to change him as he looked at his navy uniform and began to balk at putting it on.<br />
<br />
Noticing he has a massive erection, the captain had a compulsion to touch and grasp his manhood. Gripping his shaft, he begins to stroke, slowly at first, uttering a satisfying moan as he fantasizes himself balls deep into a willing partner. He never considered himself gay; but right now he couldn’t help but envisioning his shaft probing the tight ass of his exo as he starts to pick up the tempo of his stroking. Failing to notice his hands becoming rough and scaly, black talons forming where finger nails should be. He also failed to notice his feet also changing; his big and pinky toes retreating as his heel push up. His remaining toes also grow wicked looking talon while a forth forms on rear of his foot. Both his feet and hands take on a yellow hue as feathers begin to cover his body. His nose and mouth merging into a sharp yellow beak as his eyes go black while closing them, and tail feathers burst from above his ass.<br />
<br />
The captain starts moaning loudly as his testicles pull up into his body and become internal. His member taking on a more avian look, as he begins to pant and gasp. Stroking his member even harder he makes a loud grunt just as he cums violently. Gripping his phallus tightly, feeling it pulse within his new hand talon as thick jets of his seed shoot out. The captain opens his eyes as runes form on his wrists and ankles. He takes several deep breathes of satisfaction as he glances at the new him in the mirror.<br />
“I look like a peregrine falcon,” the new fury captain remarking as he admires his new look. Feeling better he gets on the com and orders the bridge to begin surface procedures.<br />
<br />
Leaving his cabin, the captain ignores putting on his uniform; finding the concept of covering his feathers with clothes just plain silly. The short walk to the bridge passing through a couple of bulkheads, he spots several crew members also changed into anthropomorphic animals.<br />
“Furies,” was the first word to come to his head as he walked by. He smiled as best he could with his hooked beak as he spotted a few more crew members in the middle of their transformation and in a sexual position that would get them dishonorably discharged from service. Yet he didn&#39;t care as he walked by; finding it natural and befitting his new nature to be sexually promiscuous.  Opening the door to the bridge of the submarine, the captain feels a rush of desire as his avian prick pokes out of his new vent. His Exo was now an anthro Cheetah fury and was enjoying a blow job from the pilot who became an anthro jack rabbit fury.<br />
“You wish to have a third join in” the captain getting their attention; his phallus all ready at full mast.<br />
“At your discretion,” was all the exo said as he gripped the captain’s prick and began stroking it all the while the captain was exploring the body of the jack rabbit fury sucking on the Exo’s feline shaft.<br />
“I never realized how good a circle jerk could feel,” the captain sighing as he watched his shaft spasm and spray his seed all over his first officer’s fury hand paws.<br />
“Shall I cancel the fire drills,” the exo wincing as his own orgasm fills the pilot’s lagomorphic muzzle.<br />
“Yes,” the captain nodding; “no need to sour this rut with a safety procedure on a vessel soon to be decommissioned. And order engines to full power,” the captain admiring the runes glowing softly on his wrists; “I want us to reach port by Tuesday morning at the earliest.”</p>
