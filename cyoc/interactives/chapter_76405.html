<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">About 2:30am Joe and his crew are heading through Rico's neighborhood. Not ones to be quiet they are slamming <br />
the trash cans to empty them and tossing the empties to the side of the road. <br />
<br />
Joe is driving. He has been doing this job for 20 years and is in a large set of coveralls that don't even zip <br />
up the front of his large frame. He is muscled but there is quite a bit of fat over the once Adonis frame. He <br />
has a greying beard and is watching as his crew empties can after can into the back of the truck.<br />
<br />
Eric a big black muscled man. Damn he was hot, could have been in the Mr. Universe contest if he had wanted <br />
but was just a garbage man at this time, was tossing the cans in the back and back to the street like they <br />
were rag dolls.<br />
<br />
Paul was a tall lanky sort of ginger guy. Not nearly as capable as Eric but he was doing well.<br />
<br />
As they got in front of Rico's place it woke Rico up. Damn them. Every week they do this.<br />
<br />
He tossed three Skylanders on the platform and pulled up the chronivac and within seconds he was changing the <br />
garbage men.<br />
<br />
What the hell is happening to me Joe gurgled out as his limbs stiffened up. It was almost like he could see <br />
through himself as his body changed and then it changed and became more opake. He couldn't see Eric or Paul <br />
but the same things were happening to them.<br />
<br />
It seemed like an eternity to him but it must have been less than a few minutes when he found himself on a <br />
platform in Rico's apartment. Rico ended the program grabbed the three plastic, perfect representations of the <br />
garbage men from outside and put them in a box. He put a label on the box and postage on it and put it on the <br />
table next to the door and went back to bed.<br />
<br />
In the morning he headed to the post office and sent the box out. He noticed some cops checking out the trash <br />
truck as he went by and a crew was getting ready to bring it back.<br />
<br />
Rico tossed the box into the post box and headed off.<br />
<br />
Joe and his crew were in a dark box for days when the top was ripped open and light suddenly streamed through <br />
the top of the box. A big hand grabbed them and pulled them out. In the box with the garbage men was a note. <br />
Dear Sam: I know that you will enjoy these characters. I picked them out just for you. Please enjoy them as <br />
you have enjoyed the ones in the past.<br />
<br />
As the plastic men were tosseled around they were able to see the owner of the big hand that had grabbed them <br />
and it was a pudgy nerd of a boy about 18. He put them on the platform and a virtual world formed around them. <br />
The boy took Joe first and he found himself in a rather stylized sling. He had been stripped of his ill <br />
fitting overalls and was now dressed in a leather harness. Legs were in stirrups up in the air as were his <br />
arms. His head hung down and a voice over started. The boy had brought up a story, a bad story, from the <br />
internet about a guy in a sling that had an endless number of men ready to use him both anally and orally. And <br />
there they were lined up to rape Joe. Not being real there was no pain for Joe but he was realizing what was <br />
going on and could do nothing about it. His jaws seemed to stretch to accommodate the size of the character he <br />
serviced as did his ass. His belly jiggled as he was pounded from one side to another and filled with cum. He <br />
even seemed to be enjoying it as his cock would spurt like a water fountain from time to time or it could be <br />
that one of the men just hit the right point on his prostate and really stimulated him. The boy watched Joe <br />
for about 20 minutes and then headed to Paul.<br />
<br />
Paul a lanky ginger guy was as comical naked in the virtual world as he would have been in the real world. He <br />
found a big burly dominant sort and he clipped Paul's nuts off. Being a virtual image he healed immediately <br />
but Paul was feeling the loss of his balls. He put a dog collar on him and had him on his hands and knees <br />
walking him around like a dog. As he played with Paul he was peeing on him and in him. Using him as a toilet. <br />
It seemed to be an almost constant flow. When he had gotten his fill of peeing the owner took his big burly <br />
arm and rammed it up Paul's ass so quick it looked like it was meant to be there.<br />
<br />
Now Eric's turn came around. The boy pulled up a site about bestiality. Eric could see where he was and if he <br />
could have panicked he would have. This big black man would have dominated anyone in his world and it was <br />
quite the change when he was strapped face down to a bench and he heard the clomp of something moving toward <br />
his ass. There with one quick move he was invaded by a massive cock. Paul and Joe could see the invasion of <br />
Eric by something that looked somewhat like a my little pony character but this thing was hung.<br />
<br />
Peter time for bed. The boy's mom yelled up to him. He left the computer on and the three were raped all night <br />
by their scenarios and in the morning when Peter woke up he unstrapped Joe. Unharnessed Paul, and unstrapped <br />
Eric. Each one of them were very bloated in their virtual world from the massive amounts of cum and pee in the <br />
case of Paul that was inserted into them over the night. <br />
<br />
As Peter ended the program they were back to their plastic bodies not bloated and fully intact. Paul had his <br />
balls back but the memories were still there.<br />
<br />
Peter was a deviant sort and would play with his new characters every night.</p>
