<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke grabbed the Pink fruit shrugged and ate it.   Chewing on it he couldn't quite figure out what it tasted like.  It tasted terrible like salt and sugar mixed together and the juice was stringy as hell.   dropping the fruit disgusted he realized that the taste had grown on him and he wanted more.<br />
<br />
The more of the fruit he ate the more he wanted it. Within seconds he had devoured the whole fruit leaving him wanting more.  Before he could look for another Tiff walked into the room and saw him reaching for one of the fruits.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing i need those!&quot; Tiff screams at him<br />
&quot;I... I.. was hungry&quot; Luke lied still trying to not let her know it was him<br />
&quot;did you eat any?&quot; she asked<br />
&quot;um...&quot; Luke though for a moment she might hurt him for stealing her rare fruits but if he told her the truth she might help him.   Thinking harder one choice would have no consequences.<br />
&quot;no i didn't eat any of them&quot;<br />
&quot;Good! now get out of my house before i kick you out!&quot; Tiff screamed at him<br />
&quot;wait you don't understand I'm...&quot;  Luke had not expected her to do that.  In a last desperate attempt he tried to tell the truth but she wouldn't let him.<br />
<br />
Luke was now on the streets he didn't know were to go or who to turn to.   Thinking of who he could go to only one name seemed logical... Dominic!  He was Lukes best friend and would understand the whole situation when explained however Dominic  lived a few miles away it would take time to reach him so Luke decided he should start moving now so he didn't get there too late at night.<br />
<br />
After walking a few blocks Luke had developed a erection from the constant rubbing from his leg and pants Unable to keep it in his pants anymore he decided no one would notice if he hid it under his shirt since his shirt was already baggy.  Walking a few more blocks now on the highway his erection would not cease if anything it seemed like it was getting more sensitive rubbing against his chest and shirt.<br />
<br />
It was better to solve this problem now rather then later looking for a spot were he wouldn't be seen by passing cars.  Looking around he sees a small ally behind a XXX shop.  Luke found a secluded spot near the trash cans unzipping his pants he released his dick from pressing against his chest a small sinew of pre cum remained from the spot his dick had been pressed hard against his chest.<br />
<br />
Leaning against the wall using his right arm to support himself he gripped to end of his dick with his other hand and began to move his hand up and down sending him into ecstasy.  Moving his hand faster and faster he tried but couldn't manage to reach a climax his usual routine of imagining having sex with his girlfriend and her friends didn't seem to work anymore.<br />
<br />
Looking around for something he could use to help out the situation he spots a few old magazines on the floor next to the trash. keeping his left hand on his dick Luke picked up one of the magazines looking at the magazine he noticed it was Teen porn.  no wonder it was thrown out if the owner was caught with it he could be arrested.  opening op the magazine he sees a few pictures of teenage boys and girls in various positions reaching the back or the magazine he stopped on a page of a fit teenage surfer-boy topless with a long boner sticking out of his boarding shorts with another surfer kneeling down attempting to stuff the other kids dick deep into his mouth.<br />
<br />
Luke imagined the hot teen doing the same thing to him the image made him harder then he had been before taking the opportunity he used both hands and vigorously jacked off.  He never felt anything like it collapsing onto the old magazines he continued to jack off moaning loudly he exploded shooting streams of cum onto his chest and face some landing in his mouth.  Luke laid there for a few minutes letting his orgasm sink in his dick started to  grow flaccid no longer shooting cum out.<br />
<br />
grabbing his dick with one hand he stuffs it back into his baggy shorts and attempts to clean himself off.  wiping him mouth attempting to get the cum off his face he begins to clean himself up. His shirt was soaked in his own cum he had no choice but to leave it behind.<br />
<br />
Luke walked off again shirtless spiting every once in a while to try and remove the taste of cum in his mouth but nothing helped.  He continues to walk down the highway passing a clothing store he decided to go in so he could get some clothes that actually fit him.<br />
<br />
Walking in the kid at the register smiles at him happy to get a customer this late at night.  Luke went inside and found a pair of shorts and some underwear that would fit him and hide his bulge better. Looking though his pockets Luke realized he only had enough money for that and would have to find a shirt later. Walking to the register Luke got a good look at the 19 year old kid at the register he wasn't bad looking his light shirt showed off his muscles well and looking down Luke saw that the kid was playing with his dick though his pocket.  Luke licked his lips adjusted himself and walked forward and bought the two articles of clothing but started getting hard thinking of the boy masturbating in front of him.<br />
<br />
Luke quickly took the clothes after paying for them and rushed out of the store moving to the back ally again he strips down placing his old clothes in a pile near the trash cans and starts to slide into the underwear realizing when he got all the way in that even though he had bought the largest pair he could find for his age/size it still lacked any room in groin area at least not enough to contain his package comfortably.  having no choice he stuffs his crotch into the undies stretching them out then goes to his shorts and puts them on his bulge still clearly visible to any one who looked was now masked slightly.<br />
<br />
Luke continues to walk onward relived that there was no more rubbing against his leg however the tightness of his groin was also uncomfortable and he ended up having to pull on them every once in a while to help stretch them out.<br />
<br />
after about thirty minutes of walking he reached his friend house.   Walking to the back yard he threw some small stones at his friends window.<br />
&quot;who is it&quot; Dominic said quietly<br />
&quot;its Luke let me in we have to talk!&quot; Luke said trying to make his voice sound as normal as possible<br />
&quot;fine I'm coming down&quot; Dominic said annoyed<br />
Luke hid behind a bush when his friend came out.<br />
&quot;Luke were ya go its late out i don't have time for this&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm over here something happened don't over react when you see me&quot;<br />
Luke walked out from behind the bush<br />
&quot;Holy shit dude what happened when yo said don't over react i expected a bad cut or you to show up scared... not looking Like a middle schooler&quot;<br />
&quot;calm down its a long story..&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
after explaining everything Luke finished off his summary with<br />
&quot;if that wasn't bad enough after eating the pink fruit Ive been getting... you know... for guys&quot;<br />
&quot;your gay?&quot;<br />
&quot;I didn't use to be the fruit changed me some how!&quot;<br />
&quot;relax i know how you feel...&quot;<br />
&quot;how would you possibly know how i feel!?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well to be honest... I'm gay&quot; Dominic said<br />
&quot;... your what?&quot;<br />
&quot;gay. i haven't told any one yet but Ive known for a few months now.  please don't tell any one!&quot;<br />
Luke saw his friend in a different way now he never though Dominic was gay he was always with girls but i guess there were signs he did enjoy drama a lot and Dominic had never once mentioned a girl was hot.  Luke felt fortunate now that he had left the child porn star part out of his story.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't tell anyone you just surprised me&quot;<br />
&quot;thank you&quot;<br />
&quot;so what do we do now&quot;<br />
&quot;well for one lets find out were your sister got that fruit&quot;<br />
&quot;I tried its impossible to ask her without telling her i ate some&quot;<br />
&quot;Didn't you say your sister left this afternoon with her friend Katie?&quot;<br />
&quot;ya&quot;<br />
&quot;so... lets ask her friend&quot;<br />
&quot;good idea thanks for helping me out&quot; Luke says<br />
<br />
Dominic pulled out his cell phone and called Katie.  When Katie answered the phone Dominic seemed surprised at what he heard.  They talked for a few minutes then Dominic hung up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie answered the phone... but she sounded like a guy apparently she ate one of the fruits you mentioned you know the yellow one and it turned her into a  guy.  For some reason though she didn't act like it was out fo the ordinary and wondered why i cared so much.   Well anyway i found out were they got the fruit&quot;<br />
&quot;were?&quot;<br />
&quot;you know that old mansion the one that the crazy scientist got arrested in?&quot;<br />
&quot;ya&quot;<br />
&quot;thats the place&quot;<br />
&quot;thank you so much i don't know what i could have done without you!&quot;<br />
&quot;Don't mention it well we better get going if we want to get to the house before dawn when we will be spotted&quot;<br />
&quot;we are going now?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ya if we go any later we don't know if the changes will become permanent or if they left a fridge open or something&quot;<br />
&quot;true...&quot;<br />
&quot;come on lets hurry&quot; Dominic says to Luke grabbing him by the wrist and pulling him off toward the street.<br />
<br />
They walked and talked about every thing from small insignificant things to deep felt emotional topics.  When they reached the Mansion Dominic had his hand on Luke's shoulder clearly this whole ordeal had brought them closer together.<br />
&quot;Now all we have to do is walk in find were the fruits came from and find a reversal fruit.. maby it will be a vegetable&quot; Dominic said trying to lighten the mood<br />
&quot;Ya lets hope its that easy&quot; Luke said taking a step toward the front door too the house.  Not realizing that Tiff and Katie has used the back door and there might be some weird home made security device guarding the entrance</p>
