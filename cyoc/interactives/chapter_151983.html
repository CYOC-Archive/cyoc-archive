<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the doctor’s news instead of going to back to her room she where she would have to deal with Lisa and her friends, she instead went to her college library and took out her laptop. At once she went to the Monster support site, a web site with information about every type of monster so far and even how many people had become that type of monster. The number of people was normally not perfect unless the number was small and here she found out that only 11 people had become Nymphs so far. She found photos of them all two had become porn stars which slightly sickened Lisa but the most where actresses, singers, models and the like. Turned out looks payed their way and once turned they gained an unnatural singing voice. That was the path that 8 out of 11 took but the other three had returned to their normal lives, one a former man had returned to his IT job, one was a lawyer and the other was a stay at home mom. <br />
<br />
It was the last one, which had the most stories about her, she had actually given birth just after turning and the baby’s had come out with her new fire red hair when before her and her husband had both had black hair. Since it was a baby boy some doctors had theorized that he was the first male Nymphs but he was too young to confirm. <br />
<br />
She looked down at her doctor’s report, there was an ID number which allowed her to confirm who she was and what she was becoming online so she could video chat with a counselor or a mentor. A mentor being someone who had gone through the change before and was willing to help someone through the change. She double checked the profile for the woman, and she was a mentor. She clicked the contact button under her profile and sent off an email with her name and story and asked to be contacted by email or video. There was the button to request a face to face meeting, but this woman lived across the nation.<br />
<br />
Then she went back to research of the change and what she could expect, there wasn’t much on Nymphs. There where whole books about life as a Centaur she could have read, or life as a fairy or how to deal with gender change but Nymphs was a two page article nothing more. Then she read about what the laws was, she would have two weeks guaranteed off from school for the change, longer if it was a major change. They couldn’t kick her out or hold her accountable for assignments. The government would provide money for new clothing and the like because of the change. She had to get all her ID changed with her new photo and if wanted name.<br />
“Name?” inquired Kim as she read, by law she could change her name instantly once the change was done. That is when an idea began to form in her head, if she couldn’t terrify those bullies she would show them up. To make it better her mother had remarried five years ago after her father died in a car crash when she was 6, she had been considering taking her stepfather’s name for a while. This was the golden chance. “I could tell them I am leaving school pack up my things and go change and come back and then show them up. Works for me.”<br />
And that is what she did, she told Lisa that she was leaving school and Lisa couldn’t help but make fun of her the whole week she packed up her stuff and left to go to the state’s transformation center. Her mother couldn’t come, it was too far, and money was still very tight, but she called every night. Her only disappointment was that her mentor hadn’t contacted her in any way, either by email or video.<br />
When walked into the lobby of the transformation center the receptionist told her that her mentors where waiting for her.<br />
<br />
“Mentors?” inquired Kim as she was lead into a small waiting room to see not one but three of the most breathtaking beautiful women she had ever seen waiting for her, all of them drinking coffee by the smell.<br />
<br />
“Ah…you must be Kim.” Said the unnaturally red-haired woman, “I am Beth, you contacted me and I hope you don’t mind but I contacted Sally and Jess to come and support you.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Kim dumb founded as she looked at the three super model bodied women around her. Beth with her firry red hair and deep green eyes, was tall slender and with a smaller bust then the others but perfect for her frame. Her jeans and white tank top looked normal but she could have been walking the runway at any fashion show in the world. <br />
<br />
Sally had blondish yellow hair pulled back in a money tail and wore business suit like the lawyer she was, but her yellow eyes and dropped dead looks made her look like someone’s wet dream even in a suit. <br />
<br />
Jess formally Jack was the only man to go through the change, while shorter then Beth she had the larger breasts, but and had dark raven hair which seamed almost purple and her eyes where a deep purple. She wore jeans and a black shirt. <br />
<br />
“Well, welcome to the club.” Said Jess in a smooth voice which was almost musical in nature. <br />
<br />
“I wonder what type she we be?” joked Sally <br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Kim as all three women raised their hands palm up as a small ball of fire formed in Beth’s hand, a ball of almost blinding light formed in Sally’s and a ball of deep blackish purple formed in Jess. “Oh what the element?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, now I know you may be wondering why all of us came out to see you.” Explained Sally as she turned into the lawyer she was. “We came to support you of course but to also give you a warning.”<br />
<br />
“A warning?” inquired Kim worried<br />
<br />
“Yes, while the change for us…minus my gender change wasn’t bad.” explained Jess “Once turned we where all approached by lets call them vultures, people who want us to sign deals to be porn stars and the like. You can understand why by our looks.”<br />
<br />
“I can.” admitted Kim <br />
<br />
“They will try to pressure you into signing with them, now you do not have to if you don’t want to and whatever happens, no matter how much money they offer please remember you must stay true to yourself.” explained Beth <br />
<br />
“Alright….” said Kim “Is there anything special I need to know about the turn?”<br />
<br />
“Only that hair/eye color and your powers are the last to change.” explained Jess as a knock at the door caused all four to look at door as it opened and a doctor walked in.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Ladies but it is time to get Kim settled in, I am afraid you will have to wait until tomorrow.” Explained the doctor</p>
