<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Excuse me, sir, sir!&quot; Exclaimed the indignant customer, waving down the store manager.<br />
<br />
The manager, one CJ Ollie Davis, let out a quick and aggressive sigh. He could tell from tone alone that this wasn&#39;t going to be one of the &quot;reasonable&quot; customers.<br />
<br />
&quot;These jeans are 75% off, but your clerks tried to charge me full price!&quot; Spoke the 5&#39;7 overweight caucasian mother.<br />
<br />
CJ, standing almost a foot taller than her at 6&#39;5, needed only a quick glance over at the jeans in question to figure out what was going on. He was about to launch into his routine of professional diplomacy. Rehearsed lines cycling through in his mind, CJ took a deep breath, opened his mouth, and said:<br />
<br />
&quot;...How do you know those jeans are 75% off?&quot;<br />
<br />
CJ surprised himself, he did not expect that&#39;s what he was going to say. Neither did the customer, apparently. She started to stir herself into a bubbling froth of outrage. After a good 20 seconds of incoherent grumbling, she grabbed the tag attached to the pants and shoved them in CJ&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look! Right there, on the tag, a &#39;75% off&#39; sticker!&quot; Crowed the 40-something.<br />
<br />
Well, CJ had already broken away from protocol. Might as well keep burning this bridge all the way to the ground.<br />
&quot;And I notice the sticker is wrinkled up, and isn&#39;t really sticking.&quot; He reached out and pulled the sticker off with ease. &quot;This is from a line that launched a week ago. Why would we run 75% off on brand new jeans?&quot; CJ made a point to keep lecturing without letting the customer but in. &quot;I get the feeling someone ripped this sticker off another article of clothing and hastily slapped it onto these jeans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, what??&quot; Spoke the customer, now operating herself at a volume of excessive wailing. &quot;Are you accusing me of lying?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t know.&quot; CJ replied. &quot;How about you and I check out the discount rack and see if there&#39;s a sticker missing, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
The customer went from &quot;outraged&quot; to borderline possessed. She started screaming and poking her extended finger into CJ&#39;s chest. In that moment, something in him finally snapped. Why does CJ keep putting up with this? Why bother? Why does he need this shitty management job?<br />
<br />
After all, CJ knows he&#39;s special. He knows he can do things that no one else can do. He knows, deep down, that if he really wanted to, he could leave all the rules of society behind him and strike out on his own. Fuck it! Why wait any longer? Take the plunge!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, ma&#39;am, big apologies.&quot; CJ said, grinning from ear to ear. &quot;We&#39;ll give you a better pair of jeans for free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-w-wait what?&quot; Asked the customer, having to stop her ranting all at once. &quot;Free jeans?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! They&#39;re right over there.&quot; CJ pointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Over where?&quot; The customer turned around, confused.<br />
<br />
Not even checking to see if anyone was around to watch, CJ extended his index and middle fingers, held them below his waistline, and launched them straight up against the unsuspecting customer&#39;s asshole.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHH!&quot; The customer screamed, turning back around. &quot;DID YOU...did you...just... uhhh...&quot; She was almost prepared to call the police, when all of a sudden her thoughts slowed down. Her anger subsided all at once, and she felt a numbing effect take place in her abdomen. Her stomach gurgled.<br />
<br />
CJ smiled, his hands folded behind his back, and casually circled around her, so he could see her from behind.<br />
&quot;Hmm, actually ma&#39;am, you might need new jeans after all.&quot; He said, watching as a subtle lump appeared in her pants.<br />
<br />
He turned back around, extended his palm, and deftly patted the entranced woman on the crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh.... mmmnffhh... what...?&quot; A soothing tingle reaching across her body, the lady was overcome with confusion as she instinctively spread her legs and began to wet herself. Within seconds, her slacks were stained in a thick line all the way down to her shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wuh oh.&quot; CJ cooed. &quot;Looks like you&#39;re going to need to clean yourself up. You can take care of that for yourself, right? Right?&quot; He joyfully paced around her in circles a few more times. &quot;Oh but... but what if you weren&#39;t able to? It would be such a shame if... if you were mentally incapable of cleaning yourself. Wouldn&#39;t it be?&quot; CJ placed his hand near her forehead and snapped his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh... ughhh...&quot; The customer groaned as every bit of experience with personal hygiene expelled itself from her memory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! What&#39;s going on?&quot; Asked an approaching teenage girl. The customer&#39;s children had been waiting by the exit this whole time. The routine they had learned was to wait until mom had finished yelling and gotten what she wanted...but it was taking longer than usual this time.<br />
<br />
The 17-year-old girl and the 13-year-old son were used to being horribly embarrassed by their mom, but this time was much more dramatic. They looked and saw she... well, smelled.<br />
&quot;M-mom???&quot; Asked the girl. &quot;Are you okay? Do I need to call an ambulance?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t be necessary.&quot; CJ answered. &quot;Your mom needs help, but it&#39;s nothing you and your brother can&#39;t take care of. In fact...&quot; CJ put his hands on their shoulders. &quot;...you two are going to be taking care of your mom from now on.&quot; The two siblings felt dizzy as a bizarre mental rearrangement overtook them. &quot;I think you guys should be the ones in charge, don&#39;t you agree?&quot; CJ added.<br />
<br />
The family took a moment to shake their heads and regain clarity. But they were no longer quite the same as they had been a minute ago.<br />
&quot;Mom, did you have an accident?&quot; Asked the daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I guess so. Look, I&#39;m busy. This store is trying to rip me off.&quot; Answered the mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;No dude, you smell. You can get jeans some other time. Right now, we need to clean you up. Come on.&quot; The teenager grabbed her mother by the wrist and started to drag her away, handing the jeans over to the store manager.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow mom, you smell really bad!&quot; Her son exclaimed to her. &quot;I can&#39;t believe Nicole and I are gonna have to clean up your poop.&quot; He poked her bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s not my fault! I didn&#39;t mean to!&quot; The mother shot back angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any more talking back and you&#39;re going to get a swat.&quot; Said the daughter firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... but!!!&quot; The mother shook.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, dude...&quot; CJ said, sneaking up to the son. &quot;Do you have a Snapchat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, obviously what am I, 90 years old?&quot; He answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool. Think you could add me, and give me updates on your mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On my mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I wanna see what it&#39;s like taking care of her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah sure.&quot; He answered, pulling out his phone and trading information.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
A mere few minutes later, CJ had laid down his nametag and work uniform for the last time, and stormed out. Never again would CJ capitulate to the expectations of normal, inferior people. He was special, and he was going to take advantage of that. Of course, he couldn&#39;t just go about randomly using his powers on people. He&#39;d need to take some time to develop a plan; to set some goals and come up with a strategy.<br />
<br />
That evening, CJ lay on the carpet in the middle of his living room. He sat there cross-legged, letting the cool air of the AC press against his back. He had spent the last 90 minutes just thinking, fantasizing, about all the things he could do. A buzz on his phone, CJ opened his Snap and saw a photograph of the 47-year-old customer from earlier laying down wearing a t-shirt and an adult diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;put mom in depends like u recommended. but ur saying these arent good enough?&quot; Asked the teenaged boy via text.<br />
<br />
&quot;yea, that brand wont hold much. keep her in Depend for now but go online and order Abena L4. thats what she needs to wear to not have leaks&quot; CJ replied. He smiled and took a screenshot of the photo, adding it to his collection alongside an earlier Snap of the mother standing up with her legs spread out as her daughter meticulously wiped shit off her bare bottom.<br />
<br />
As you can see, CJ has some reality-bending abilities. He is what is known as a &quot;Humilis&quot;, a group of people with special powers relating to humiliation. It is estimated that there are between 3,000 and 200,000 Humili alive today, each with unique abilities. The way to become a Humili is to go through a very specific life experience in childhood. It works like this:<br />
<br />
1. You experience prolonged and intense embarrassment and shaming over something<br />
2. At some point, you finally stand up for yourself and fight back against the people who are humiliating you<br />
3. You are physically attacked by your abusers, and forced to endure worse humiliation than ever<br />
4. Your individualistic spirit is broken, and you are traumatized to the point that you may never want to stand up for yourself again<br />
<br />
If all four of these events occur in sequence, then &quot;Humola&quot;, the Goddess of Shame, will approach you and grant you the powers of a Humilis. This can only happen if it takes place before puberty, and it won&#39;t work if you try to arrange it on purpose. IE a parent cannot deliberately abuse their child to make them into a Humilis--the endowment of power is only qualified if nobody involved knows about the Humili.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
So how did CJ become a Humilis? He was on a field trip in the 3rd grade, and all the stress and excitement brought out his bedwetting issues. He always leaked at night every once and a while, but this field trip had him soaking the sheets every time. CJ was already an unpopular kid, but the pressure of sharing hotel beds with his classmates caused the social chastising to become significantly worse. Eventually, even the teachers gave up trying to quell the bullying, as they themselves were fed up with CJ&#39;s bedwetting issues. They were secretly kind of glad CJ was getting bullied for it. <br />
<br />
On the third day, a teacher dragged CJ into the store with soaking wet pajamas and bought Boys&#39; Goodnites for him. The bullying back in the hotel worsened as boys were calling him names like &quot;dumb baby&quot; and &quot;diaper boy&quot;. CJ decided he&#39;d had enough of it. He stood up on the bed and started pointing the finger back at all of them. He screamed that he shouldn&#39;t be blamed for a condition he has no control over.<br />
&quot;How would YOU like to be treated if YOU peed the bed, huh?&quot; He exclaimed.<br />
<br />
CJ had done what every cartoon and PSA had told him to do: stand up for himself. But it didn&#39;t work. The kids just started attacking him harder. They started hitting him with pillows. Then they put books and binders in the pillows and it him with that. Again, the teachers didn&#39;t care--they just hoped CJ wouldn&#39;t bruise too badly. One boy tore CJ&#39;s pants and shirt off. For the rest of the field trip, the boys didn&#39;t let him wear pajamas: they forced him to sleep in nothing but his Goodnite every night. When the field trip was finally over, CJ just collapsed in his bedroom and had a mental breakdown. He sobbed all night, and the only thing that kept him from contemplating suicide was an unfamiliarity with how suicide worked.<br />
<br />
When he finally did get to sleep, he was plunged into a vivid, very real feeling dream of him ascending a flight of glass stairs up in a starry night sky, surrounded by purple clouds. He climbed these stairs for a few minutes, before reaching the top and confronting a tall, beautiful woman in a white silk dress. She introduced herself as Humola: the Goddess of Shame. She explained to him what we already explained a minute ago.<br />
&quot;Furthermore,&quot; she said, &quot;Humili will grow up to have large, developed and attractive bodies. You&#39;ll be able to look like a body builder with minimal exercise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, um... that&#39;s cool!&quot; CJ said. He always liked the look of big, muscular men. It would only be a few more years before he figured out he was gay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now...&quot; Humola crossed her legs and sat down in front of him. &quot;To answer the question you&#39;ve probably been wondering this whole time: just what powers does a Humilis have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; CJ muttered, hypnotized by her glowing beauty. &quot;...yeah? What are my powers going to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Every Humilis has different powers, based around what kind of trauma they were put through. And so you, CJ...&quot; Humola took the young boy&#39;s hands, &quot;You will have powers over bedwetting, incontinence, diapers and infantile behavior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. That&#39;s kind of a dumb power.&quot; CJ started to tear up, the emotional wounds still very raw inside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can use your powers as much or as little as you like. The more you train, the more powerful you can become. And do be careful: Humili tend to be very competitive and aggressive. If you draw too much attention to yourself, you might be targeted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well why&#39;re you giving me these powers, then??&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, just so you can have your revenge.&quot; Humola answered. &quot;You&#39;ve been through enough, so you should be allowed to get back at the world. I know what it&#39;s like to be mistreated. My father, Gortobi, the God of Wealth, coerced me into marriage, and forced me to birth 1,000 children against my will. When I finally had my freedom, I turned him into a pig, and then feasted upon him as bacon and ham with my friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s messed up!&quot; CJ said. &quot;But I guess he deserved it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes he did, and he knows it. I made sure that he wouldn&#39;t die, even when cut up and eaten. He is alive right now, inside of me, hearing everything we say. He is probably crying and sobbing, knowing he can&#39;t do anything about it, because he is nothing but a bit of digested bacon meat in my body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;J-jesus! That&#39;s sick dude!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is inside not only me, but all of my friends. His consciousness is split among 36 people, forced to watch their lives from a distance. He will spend eternity, never allowed to speak or act ever again.&quot;<br />
<br />
CJ started to sob, not knowing how to process this scary story.<br />
<br />
Humola smiled. It always turns her on whenever she gets to tell this story to someone. She hopes this new kid will grow up to become cruel like her. She gets the sense he&#39;s probably gay, so she&#39;ll want to pay very close watch on him for some guy-on-guy action. She cut a hole in the glass floor around CJ, plunging the crying child into the abyss.<br />
<br />
A moment later, CJ awoke. The crisp 7am sunlight beamed down on his face. A quick check...yep, he had wet the bed again. But at least he was wearing one of the Goodnites Mr. Bolton bought for him, and he didn&#39;t have any leaks.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
CJ really didn&#39;t want to go to school that morning. He avoided all of the boys who had abused him on the field trip as much as he could, but they inevitably continued to make fun of him. He had another panic attack in the bathroom during lunch break. But he remembered the weird dream that he&#39;d had. Maybe that dream was real? It certainly felt real. What if he actually had powers now? Exiting the bathroom stall, he saw one of the kids who had bullied him right there, unzipping his pants in front of a urinal. Figuring it doesn&#39;t matter what anyone thinks of him at this point, CJ followed his instincts. He reached out and smacked his classmate on the crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-HEY!&quot; Snapped the boy. &quot;WHAT&#39;D Y-you... do that... for...&quot; His yelling slowed down and stopped. His mouth hung open and he went cross-eyed. A moment later, a dark spot grew in the front of his shorts. The spot spread down to his legs, soaking partly up his bottom, then drizzling down to the tile floor. The boy snapped out of his trance a moment later, then looked down confusedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...wow dude.&quot; CJ said. &quot;Did you just wet yourself? What a dumb baby.&quot; He said, cocking his head and leaving the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really do have powers??&quot; CJ thought to himself.<br />
<br />
That very same boy seemed to really hate him now. His name was Neil, and he wanted to get back at CJ for making fun of him. So Neil made a point to keep bringing up CJ&#39;s bedwetting in front of other classmates a few days later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, but you peed your pants too.&quot; CJ shot back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh. You&#39;re lying!&quot; Neil retorted, correctly assuming that no one would believe CJ.<br />
<br />
The next day in PE, CJ got his revenge once again. He managed to sneakily pat Neil on the crotch again, this time sending his pee sprinkling out all over the basketball court in front of everyone.<br />
<br />
And yet...Neil still didn&#39;t get made fun of. He was simply more liked than CJ in the first place; only CJ was in the unfortunate position of being unpopular AND a bedwetter.<br />
<br />
Furious and dejected, CJ plotted his ultimate revenge. He invited four of his worst bullies to a sleepover, Neil included. He lured them all in by promising to buy each one of them a $60 video game of their choosing if they came. He had no plan of fulfilling that promise, naturally. All he did was wait for them to drop their guard, and then quickly smacked them all between the legs. It seems as though his powers allow him to get away with that pretty easily. The four boys were about to throw a fit over their soaking pants, when CJ had an instinct to place his hands on their foreheads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you might need to wear diapers tonight. Let me help you with that.&quot; CJ said, smiling. He felt his powers growing stronger. Not only could he make them wet themselves, he could hypnotize them into agreeing to being put in a diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure dude.&quot; Neil said, taking off his pants along with the other boys. CJ had gotten his mom to buy a box of Pampers size 7, and the 3rd graders all fit into them without too much hassle. He felt his powers growing even stronger, and felt the instinct to touch each of them in the butt. Sure enough, they all started to mess themselves a few minutes later. Not only did CJ have them lay down to get changed, but he made sure to take pictures and record video. Neil was getting changed by CJ, while one of the other bullies held the camera. Then Neil held the camera while that bully got changed.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey CJ!&quot; Said Neil in the cafeteria. &quot;Awesome sleepover last night. But when are you gonna buy our games?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, any day now.&quot; CJ answered. &quot;So...what did you think of the part where you wore a diaper and pooped yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I was pretty embarrassed. Thanks for changing me, though! You&#39;re not going to tell anyone about it, right?&quot; Neil said, bumping him with his elbow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. You bullied me really badly about bedwetting, I think you deserve to be made fun of for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on dude! Please don&#39;t do that, I&#39;m sorry for making fun of you and beating you up... please?&quot; Neil pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh fine, okay whatever.&quot; CJ pouted, not knowing how to feel.<br />
<br />
He held onto those pics and videos, weeks went by before he finally decided not to post them online. He decided to keep them for himself. He found them very enjoyable to watch. Those recordings were part of what helped him figure out he was gay over the next few years.<br />
<br />
CJ decided that even though Neil and the others were bad people, that didn&#39;t mean he could use his powers like that. He was tempted many times, but almost never used his powers on anyone. Well ok, he made them all wet the bed every night for a few months, but he finally stopped messing with them after that. Sometimes he would make a new bully wet himself (or herself), or make some rude adult poop them self in public, but very rarely. The only time CJ used his powers for personal desire were in Junior year of high school, there was a classmate he was super into but he knew was straight. He invited CJ to over to hang out at his house one evening, and CJ decided to abuse his powers on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, Imma go to the bathroom real quick.&quot; The boy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Hold on now.&quot; CJ stood up and put a hand on his forehead. &quot;Don&#39;t you need me to help you with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
He guided his &#39;friend&#39; to the toilet, took off his pants and underwear and helped him aim while he peed. Then he wiped him up and put his clothes back on.<br />
<br />
Other than that one time, CJ never used his powers that indulgently again. Though he would occasionally hypnotize someone to go to the bathroom and use the toilet. That way he could keep &quot;using his powers&quot; and maintaining his power level. He didn&#39;t want his powers to weaken, so he wanted to keep exercising it in case he needed it later.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Today, of course, was the moment he had been preparing for. Here he sat, a 22-year-old who just quit his job managing a shitty overpriced clothing store. He had just made a grown woman urinary and fecal incontinent, and engineered a psychological role-reversal with her children. He wasn&#39;t sure how long the effects would last--his instincts were telling him they&#39;d wear off in a few weeks. That&#39;s part of why he wanted to Snap with the son; so he could find out just how powerful he is by now.<br />
<br />
Only one thing to do next: keep training and testing the limits of his abilities.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
The next day, CJ put his car on Craigslist, and pretended he was going to sell it for super cheap. He made arrangements with a prospective buyer in a matter of minutes. At 1:30 that afternoon, man in a nice shiny pickup truck showed up on CJ&#39;s driveway.<br />
<br />
The man, pale and white, 5 feet 10 inches, somewhere in his mid 40&#39;s and a bit less chubby than the woman from yesterday, looked at CJ a bit apprehensively. It looked like he didn&#39;t completely trust this very tall, black man.<br />
&quot;So you... are really gonna let this baby go for just $1,500?&quot; He asked, taking a close look at CJ&#39;s car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, no doubt. Definitely.&quot; CJ said, watching intently as the man knelt down in front of him. Seeing his balding dome from behind, CJ snuck up and placed his hand onto his head. &quot;Speaking of babies, we need to get you changed. Come inside, won&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The older man cooperated as though it was nothing unusual.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your name, honey?&quot; CJ asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick.&quot; Answered the man, being lead into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Rick, let&#39;s get your pants off.&quot; CJ said as he laid Rick down and relieved him of all clothing but his shirt.<br />
<br />
CJ had grown up to be an ABDL, probably because of his abuse and the powers he was given as a result. So he had all the supplies he needed under the bed. A minute later, Rick was having baby powder rubbed into his hairy bottom, followed by the folding and taping of a big diaper with cartoon animal print, and concluded by the snapping of a big, pink onesie over the crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright dude, you&#39;re kinda freaking me out, I thought you were gonna show me your car an--MMFH!&quot; Rick&#39;s complaints were halted when an adult sized pacifier was shoved into his mouth. Rick found himself unwilling to spit it on, and instead started to suck away on it.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Rick&#39;s padded bottom was sat flat on the living room carpet, fixated on the big TV. CJ had put on episodes of Starbeam. The colors and funny voices filled Rick with amusement and cheer. CJ sat on the loveseat behind Rick, with CJ&#39;s legs locked around Rick&#39;s shoulders, and continuously holding his palm on Rick&#39;s head. He spent the next half hour steadily regressing Rick&#39;s mental state.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmrrbbrrr... brrrhthhhrhrrrr...&quot; Rick blew spit bubbles out of his mouth and down his cheek as CJ laid him down and unbuttoned his onesie and tucked it up over his belly. &quot;Daddy, I wan ice cream!&quot; He exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay baby, you can have one scoop of ice cream later.&quot; CJ answered. He untaped his diaper and started wiping him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I wan TWO scoops! Three scoops!&quot; Rick pouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, no sweetie, just one for tonight.&quot; CJ answered.<br />
<br />
The door rang just as CJ was finished with the diaper change.<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot; CJ muttered to himself. He wasn&#39;t expecting anyone. He waltzed over to the front door and opened it to see a spritely white woman in her mid 20&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Lynn Cophone, interested in buying your car?&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;...oh, OH!&quot; CJ exclaimed. &quot;Right! I&#39;m sorry I totally... forgot...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy?&quot; Spoke a voice behind him.<br />
<br />
CJ slowly turned to look, as Rick stood right there, clutching a stuffed giraffe, his onesie pulled up over his belly and exposing his diaper. CJ turned back to Lynn, who appeared...concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;...uhh, did I pick a bad time?&quot; She asked, backing away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! No, uh, just... ugh fuck it.&quot; CJ reached out and grabbed Lynn directly on the head.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeeeheeeheee! Linny all wet!&quot; Giggled Rick, kicking his feet up and down in the bubble bath. Lynn was squatted down beside him, scrubbing away on his hairy back.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, Linny is getting so wet because Ricky keeps splashing everywhere!&quot; Lynn cooed, her bra visible through her soaked blouse. &quot;You&#39;re such a big boy, it&#39;s gonna take for-EVER to get you clean!&quot; She smiled.<br />
<br />
CJ stood behind them, watching intently and smiling contently. The adult baby now had a caretaker. His senses were telling him that these effects would last for at least a week, and he could keep renewing the effects as many times as he wanted. He checked his Snapchat, and saw a pic of the mother sleeping soundly in a diaper.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
A week went by with this routine. The mother eventually started getting out of diapers as her daughter re-pottytrained her, but Rick continued to live as an infant as CJ kept renewing the regression every morning. Lynn stuck around as well as he kept making her devotion to him stronger. CJ felt his powers must be truly enhanced by now. He decided it was time to take a big risk, and reach out to other Humili.<br />
<br />
He snuck around on some Humili communities on the dark web, and got into DMs with one Humilis in particular named &quot;hexLeader92&quot;. After some vague and confusing correspondence, CJ agreed to meet up with this person at a local cafe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. Fucking wow.&quot; Thought the Humilis in question. &quot;This guy is a total sucker. He agreed to meet with me without getting a pic of what I look like, my real name or identity, or even what my powers are! This is either the easiest catch I&#39;ve had in years, or this is a trap. Better be prepared for both.&quot; Thought the Humilis, as they got dressed for their afternoon at the cafe.</p>
