<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Don&#39;t worry, dude. I&#39;m Francis and he is my best friend!&quot; Francis said. I didn&#39;t understand how he can act as natural as if we aren&#39;t getting into too much troubles but I think that his behavior was better than being in panic. The former boy in front of us was completely shocked that he wasn&#39;t able to move properly, he was shaking as I can see from his trembling hands.<br />
&quot;Did you turn me into this...?&quot; Johnny managed to say with his scared voice. &quot;I&#39;m big and hairy and...&quot;<br />
&quot;Awesome&quot; Francis said. &quot;I think you grew well, dude. Not everybody can get a good looking body like yours!&quot;<br />
Francis get distracted trying to calm down Johnny and I realize that I had to turn back the sleeping man to a baby almost as fast as I can before he notes me. I started to set the remote, I wasn&#39;t sure about the baby&#39;s age but I assumed he was under 1 year old. I set the transformation duration to inmediate and I pointed to the sleeping man in the grass.<br />
&quot;So, be happy with yourself, right buddy...&quot; Francis was saying to Johnny when he turned back and saw me almost shooting the beam. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t do that!&quot;<br />
He jumped over me before I was able to shoot. As he was way more stronger than me now, he was able to take me off the remote easily.<br />
&quot;Give it to me! It&#39;s mine!&quot; I yelled to him.<br />
&quot;Oh, if you want it too much... them take it!&quot; Francis said and he shot the remote to me. I feel sudden energy on my body followed by a sudden feeling of falling, the world was increasing and I was collapsing inside my clothes which looked like big blankets. I tried to move, but I feel my body numb. Finally, I was almost immobile under a pile of clothing, I can hear Francis laughing and Johnny making a big gasp.<br />
After some seconds, I saw the clothes moving, revealing a big pair of hairy hands which took me out of the pile. Those were Francis&#39; hands who now looked huge. In fact, he was huge now, like a giant. Next to him was a giant Johnny who looked at me scared.<br />
&quot;Aww... you&#39;re so adorable!&quot; Francis said to me. &quot;Those Little fingers had been a trouble all day, so I will assume to lead role from now! He he!&quot;<br />
&quot;How? How do you turn him into a baby?!&quot; I heard Johnny to say. &quot;Is he alright?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course... It&#39;s like I told you before, dude.&quot; Francis said.<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Johnny looked at the man in the grass. &quot;That means, that naked man could be... Danny?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. But he could be... He was a baby when we found him.&quot; Francis said smiling.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a freak! A monster!&quot; Johnny began to yell. &quot;How do you dare to do that to a baby, to me or to your own friend!&quot;<br />
&quot;Just like this!&quot; Francis said and he used the remote on Johnny again. Suddenly, he turned into a baby who begin to cry in the grass. &quot;I think I need a plan before I continue. I have too much ideas on mind and no time for troubles... But first...&quot; He looked at the sleeping man. &quot;I think you&#39;re right, buddy. Danny could be a lot of troubles... and I have enough with you and Johnny who are way more easy to handle.&quot;<br />
He pointed the remote to the man and with a zap he turned back into a small baby. It was great that he didn&#39;t awake in all this time.<br />
&quot;I will return him to his mother, but I need a plan. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea that a grown man returns him...&quot; He saw at Johnny who was still crying. &quot;But maybe a kid, a friend of his son can do it...&quot;<br />
He set the remote and then he shot himself. I saw how Francis turned back to his former age, but he didn&#39;t stop there. He regressed to a small kid. I&#39;m sure he was 9 or 10 years old now, like Johnny when we met him.<br />
&quot;These clothes won&#39;t make it.&quot; Francis said in his childish voice. &quot;And Johnny has torn his clothes... Ok, I think I only have your clothe... Oh, how stupid I am! The remote has a clothing option!&quot;<br />
He set the remote again and then he turned his bigger clothes into kid&#39;s clothing. It fits him perfectly and now he looked like a regular boy.<br />
&quot;I will return Danny. So, you two wait me here!&quot; Francis said and with the baby on his hands he walk to where the mother was. I wasn&#39;t able to see what he did over there as I was almost immobile next to the crying Johnny. A few moments later, a mysterious shadow cover us. It was a guy who heard Johnny&#39;s crying.<br />
&quot;What? Babies? What are they doing here?&quot; The guy who looked around 18 years old said. &quot;Maybe his parents are nearby looking for them.&quot;<br />
He took us in his arms and was disposed to walk with us when Francis arrived.<br />
&quot;Hello, these babies are your brothers, friend?&quot; The guy said to Francis, but he didn&#39;t answered. I wasn&#39;t able to see what he was doing but then I saw a shining which covered the guy. I feel how slowly we where falling to the grass eventhough we were still on the guy&#39;s arms. After some seconds, he wasn&#39;t capable to hold us and we fell. Fortunately, it wasn&#39;t a long fall and we&#39;re almost safe.<br />
&quot;Another more, perfect!&quot; Francis said. &quot;Fun is bigger with more friends! Ha ha ha!!&quot;<br />
He set the remote again and zapped himself. In a matter of seconds, he turned back to his 35 years old self wearing appropriate clothes. I guess he&#39;s getting ability with the remote.<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t worry, Johnny. I had explained to your mom that you&#39;ll be playing in my house all the evening.&quot; Francis said smiling. &quot;I was surprised of how easy she accepted it. She isn&#39;t a very clever mother... Ha ha ha&quot;</p>
