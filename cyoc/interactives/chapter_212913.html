<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“…It’s loving time!” Ty quietly says with a snap of his finger <br />
<br />
“What’s this loser doing in our sight?” Thomas hollers <br />
<br />
“Yeah you faggot, you got some nerve being in our presence!” Rob spites <br />
<br />
“Looks like you need to be taught a lesson by your superiors.” Jim says cracking his knuckles <br />
<br />
Little did they know Ty’s power was already taking hold of them<br />
<br />
“Incorrect, you three will be taught a lesson…” Ty says loudly giving Dustin a side glance “… in love for your fellow MAN.<br />
<br />
The three Pompous jocks burst out laughing unable to believe the audacity of the shrimp in front of them.“HAHAHAAHHAHAHAHHH!!!” “You see this clown!?” “He can’t be serious?” “Give ‘em an inch am I right guys?” “That’s enough fun let’s get this geek!”<br />
<br />
When they tried to make a move towards Ty they found their body’s frozen in place. <br />
<br />
“Hey I can’t move!” Jim yells with a worried look in his eyes <br />
<br />
“Me neither!” Rob comments with a pale face<br />
<br />
“Guys help I think I’m paralyzed! Thomas starts whimpering <br />
<br />
“There’s no point in calling for help boys, I made this vicinity disconnected from the world.” Ty said as he strolled up to the frozen young men “As far as we’re concerned we are completely alone in every sense”<br />
<br />
“What? How!?” Thomas asks feeling fear for the first time in his young life staring at Ty with tears forming in his eyes <br />
<br />
“This can’t be real!? Jim yells in frustration shaking his head back and forth trying to force his rock hard body to obey <br />
<br />
“You better stop this or else!” Rob screams as he struggles to move his swole body in futile defiance <br />
<br />
“The more you fight against my will the worse your punishments will be, so you better stop and calm down” Dustin takes this chance to speak up too “You are in no position to order us around or should I say Ty around so if you’re smart I’d do as he says.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t take orders from runts you traitor!” Rob growls  <br />
<br />
“Yeah I thought you was cool Dusty but here you are in cahoots with this witchcraft bitch!” Jim accuses Dustin <br />
<br />
“Please I’m sorry for all the bad things I did to you… and others, just stop this pl-PLEASE I-I’ll make it up to you and the others I bullied so please I’M s-SORRY let me GO!!!” Thomas starts to wail with tears rolling down his cheeks <br />
<br />
“Geez man I think Tom here is legit remorseful” Dustin says looking at his brother <br />
<br />
“I am, really I am! I never wanted to be a punk but that was the only way to be excepted as one of the guys I swear!” Thomas starts to blabber <br />
<br />
“I know he’s sorry… “ Ty says walking up to Thomas “I can see your thoughts and I see you felt bad for the harassment towards me and the others, not only at the moment even in the past.” <br />
<br />
“Yes I’ll be a better person! A better man, just give me a chance to make it up to you and everyone else.” Thomas says desperately<br />
<br />
“Ok dude I’ll forgive you…” Ty says<br />
<br />
Thomas’s fearful face starts to have some hope in them <br />
<br />
“But you have to make it up to me and the other people you bullied by sticking by my side with Dusty and help me correct a few wrongs, starting with your aggressive friends here…” <br />
<br />
Thomas nods vigorously “You won’t regret this I promise!” He says as his body becomes unfrozen and he shakes off the jitters <br />
<br />
“Come stand next to me bro.” Dustin says with a outstretched hand <br />
<br />
“Thanks Dusty you really are a cool guy, you and your brother” Thomas says thankfully <br />
<br />
“Thomas you bitch ass bastard how can you side with those rot munchers over us?!” Rob screams at Tom <br />
<br />
“Thomas I always knew you was a faggot!!” Jim spites at Toms direction <br />
<br />
“You two love to use gay slurs don’t you?” Ty asked rhetorically “And take every opportunity to hate those who have homosexual tendencies, more so than others with traits you deem beneath you.” <br />
<br />
“And?” Says Rob and Jim still defiant <br />
<br />
“And I shall be reiterate what I said earlier…It’s loving time.” Ty says with a snap of his finger <br />
<br />
“What’s that supposed to-” before Jim could  finish his sentence he body started to move on its own, his hands pulling his shirt up and off then undoing the belt around his waist<br />
<br />
“Hey whats going on?” Rob speaks up as his body was doing the same as Jim’s, dropping his shirt on the ground and unbuttoning his pants<br />
<br />
“You both going to have a bonding session boys.” Ty calmly answers <br />
<br />
Both Jim’s and Rob’s bodies are now standing there just in underwear, clothes sprawled around there feet, both slowly turn in unison towards the other then step closer towers the other <br />
<br />
“Wait! What are you doing?! Stop!” Jim yells desperately as his body controlled by its self walked up to Rob<br />
<br />
“No not this please!!!” Rob hollers as he realizes what Ty has in store to them as his body steps up to Jim’s <br />
<br />
Both of there Body&#39;s embrace and start rubbing up against the other, arms around the other, hands messaging and kneeling the others back in a sensual way as there crotches grind into the others<br />
<br />
“Stop dude this is so gay!!!” Jim yells into the air face up in the sky <br />
<br />
“I’m not a fag! I’m not a fag!” Rob screams shaking his head trying to get away<br />
<br />
The rubbing and caressing made their cocks hard and leaking, obvious in the tight underwear’s. <br />
<br />
The bodies of there own accord was feeling up the others pecs and abs before Robs body knelt down pulling Jim’s underpants down freeing his engorged penis and stood back up as Jim’s body did the same freeing Robs penis from its prison <br />
<br />
“Oh my god NOOOO!!” Both Rob and Jim hoarsely screams as their heads twist and turn, trying to detach from there body’s to no avail <br />
<br />
Their hands grab the others dick and start stroking “Shit this can’t be happening!” Rob yells trying to fight the euphoria “ Holy fuck dude your hands working my junk better than most girls dude!” Jim says full of ecstasy unable to fight against this forced sex <br />
<br />
“Looks like one of you has given in but the other still resists” Ty comments “ Time to break the in broken with the broken…” he say with another snap <br />
<br />
There bodies stop the mutual handjobs give the young men a chance to breathe and collect themselves <br />
<br />
“What are you gonna make us do now?” Rob asked worriedly as his body spun around and bent over presenting his ass towards Jim<br />
<br />
“Jim has given in to my power and your body” Ty says with a smile “ While you continue to be defiant to me and you feelings. So he gets to top you.” <br />
<br />
“What no No NO! I’m no fag and I’m no bitch! Jim fight it!!!”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry dude I can’t even if I want to…” Jim says as his body moved into position and started to insert his cock into Robs waiting behind “ I’m so fucking horny man I need this. I need you!” He says as his body started humping <br />
<br />
“Fuck! Huff fuck!Fuck huhh! FUCK!!!” Rob yells out as his body was on it knees and hands getting pumped by Jim<br />
<br />
Rob being an alpha male was not happy about this, his face red and scrunched fighting desperately not to enjoy any of this, even if this was the best sex he ever had in a long while. Jim on the other hand was on cloud nine his eyes closed and mouth partly ajar, completely lost to the good feels his body was sending. <br />
<br />
Rob was fighting a losing battle, little by little his face turned from anger and frustration to bliss. Moaning in unison with Jim’s grunts, the sound of moans and grunting mixed with flesh slapping grew louder and increased pace<br />
<br />
“Fuck dude I can’t hold back anymore!” Rob whines desperately. “Me too man, let’s finish together, I don’t care if that’s gay.” Jim says between thrusts <br />
<br />
With a few powerful thrusts both young buff men cum harder than they ever had in their lives. Both yelling and gasping with pure excitement and relief, the top filling the other with his seed and the bottom squirting on the ground <br />
<br />
Once fully spent both collapsed into the other now laying on the floor both now covered in semen panting heavily <br />
<br />
“So boys…” Ty speaks to them “I hope you remember what you did today the next time you wish to bully someone for being homosexual or just being something you don’t like.”<br />
<br />
Both Jim and Rob exhausted could only look up and nod towards Ty, faces sweaty and blushing with embarrassment and post sex<br />
<br />
Dustin was clapping at Ty’s success at humbling these bullying jocks as Thomas looked on with…</p>
