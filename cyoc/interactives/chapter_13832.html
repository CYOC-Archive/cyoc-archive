<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken was a huge man with huge muscles. He liked to wear a military cut and shaved looks with perfectly groomed uniform. but of late he was getting a little shaggy. He keeps forgetting to shave and sometimes even to bath. Erick was very busy and had forgotten absolutely about the experiment with the chronivac. But his eyes were on his brother lately, Ken were a bully pain in the ass, but in the last week he was very strange. But didn&acute;t said anything until Ken talk to him during breakfast. <br />
&quot; I don&acute;t know what happening to me. Lately i have no will to go to work. I only think in workout at the gym and eating or fucking&quot; said Ken. <br />
&quot; Maybe you need a vacation.&quot; Answered Erick while looking at the TV.<br />
&quot; I don&acute;t know, boys at the work says that i too aggressive and being too rough to everyone, but i don&acute;t feel different, beside getting a lot hairier&quot; He say-ed scratching a scrub in his face. &quot;Shit ! i forgot to shave again... What&acute;s is happening to me ? uuuh !!&quot; He let out a grunt of frustration. Ken paid no attention and went to college. During a class about human evolution, he remembered about the caveman template and the Chronivac, but he was sure that he closed the application before doing anything. he decided to check the Chronivac when he got home. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ken was at work. His uniform fitted very bad, as he had suddenly gained muscular mass, and his body itched so much... but it wasn&acute;t the worst of it, any woman the passed by him smelled so good. Absolutely pussy smell. They needed him, the stronger one to dominate them. Eh... he was the stronger male around, he looked to the bosses and his friends and there wasn&acute;t any male to challenge his rule. <br />
Ken shaked his head. What was happening to him ? He was having each time more trouble to control his thoughts.<br />
He decided to drink a few beers... coffee... at the security room. Maybe he was sleepy or something. When he got there, his friend Mike was reading some papers. Ken passed by him grunting something and went to the freezer looking for beer.... no... to the coffee machine. It was like he was getting trouble to resist urges.<br />
Mike sniffed in the air. &quot; Hey Ken, have you bathed this week ?&quot;<br />
&quot; Leave mee ALONE  !!!&quot; Ken overreacted, hitting the table and spilling the coffee. His voice was rougher and deep. <br />
&quot;Easy man, i was kidding. What&acute;s the matter with you ?&quot; said Mike. <br />
&quot;I don&acute;t know. Me...i...am feeling strange lately, maybe a flu or something&quot; spoke Ken, apparently having trouble to form the words. <br />
&quot;I guess you will feel better when you read this.&quot; Said Mike handling a piece of paper to Ken. <br />
Ken looked in the paper. At first he saw only scrabble, but then he remembered the letters, but was difficult to read, to remember the meaning of the words. He lifted his eyes back to the smiling face of Mike that looked as if something great was written on the paper and he was waiting to Ken to lighten up by it. <br />
&quot;Not feeling well... guess i go home now&quot; Said Ken taking of his shirt to change back to regular clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;You must be really bad to react like this to a raise... &quot; Mike had a very disappointed tone in his voice. &quot; But ... wow.... you are taking those new high-testoterone anaboilizants ? It even hard to see your skin under so much hair in you arms. <br />
Ken only hasted home, without paying attention to his friend. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
At night when Erick went home, he found the house in the dark. All the lights were turned off, only the TV shinned over the living room. Something smelled very bad, many cans of beers and rests of food were spilled around the room. His brother was sited in the sofa shirtless. Somewhat he was bigger than before, and lot hairier too. He jaws was more pronounced, and his eyebrows joined in the middle. His nose flared around until he capt-ed the smell of something that had fall-ed in the ground, he immediately grabed it and ate. He was barefoot, and his toe seemed longer, his leg were ultrahairy, as the rest of his body. He was wearing only boxers and his posture on the sofa seemed very primitive. His stubble on the face were impossibly long to be only some days worth, it was near a regular shaggy beard. Erick had no more doubts, somehow Ken were changing into a caveman.</p>
