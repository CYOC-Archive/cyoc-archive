<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Never having been the one to want to wear clothes of the opposite sex and gender, Dirk sat at the desk, staring at the screen, wondering why he even decided to type something as ridiculous as what he had just typed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; Dirk reassured himself, &quot;It's obvious that I wanted to try something new in our sexual activities. But how am I to know if it will work or if Arianna will even go along with the whole role reversal if I suggest that we should try something new and possibly exciting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pondering this, Dirk stood and began to pace back and forth. Unsure of the whole thing, he reached for the mouse, deciding to delete the wish, but then stopped, pulled his hand away and went back to pacing. After a bit, he repeated the action of reaching for the mouse, intent on deleting the wish, but never being able to bring himself to complete such a course of action.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are being ridiculous,&quot; Dirk chastised himself. Either delete it and move on or save it and find some way to prove that it works.&quot;<br />
<br />
He paused in his thoughts and then asked himself, &quot;How would I go about proving that some note on a computer could actually grant me a wish,&quot; and returned to his pacing. After a bit more pacing, Dirk decided to save the wish and try something.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to wait for Arianna’s return in two weeks, Dirk figured that the best way to see if the wish would come true would be to force it. And the best way to do such an action would be to head out into the wide world dressed as a girl, act like a girl and hope that that people would treat him as such. Or so Dirk silently reassured himself as he went to the closet and dresser were Arianna kept her clothes.<br />
<br />
From the closet he selected a pink, short-sleeved button down off of a hanger, complete with a light purple tank top. Next he selected a black skirt, also hanging in the closet. Moving to the dresser, he choose a pair of low cut bikini briefs with a floral pattern, but hesitated on the idea of trying to put on one of Arianna’s bras. After a moment of deciding, Dirk instead choose a pair of black, sheer panty hose from the drawer.<br />
<br />
Returning to the closet Dirk searched about until he found the inserts that Arianna sometimes wore to make her breasts appear a cup to two cups bigger. Laying all this on the bed, Dirk looked at it and then slowly began to undress.<br />
<br />
Selecting the underwear first, he pulled them on, tucking his penis and testicles back, hoping that it looked more realistic this way, but slightly disappointed that the underwear was somewhat baggy. Shrugging, Dirk sat down in the same fashion he saw Arianna do and began to slide the panty hose on, noticing that it corrected the bagginess of the underwear, forcing them to hug the body.<br />
<br />
Next he chose the purple tank top, which Dirk noticed was sort of tight in the chest and shoulders region. Fearing that the button down wouldn’t fit, he picked it up and with some trepidation, he began to pull it on.<br />
<br />
Having completed this, noting that it was tight mostly in the shoulders, Dirk began to button the buttons, noting that they only came halfway up. Shifting about, wondering to himself why women tortured themselves by wearing clothes that were so tight , Dirk took the inserts and slipped them down the tank top, glad that the button down and undershirt were tight enough to hold them in place and keep them from sliding down.<br />
<br />
Picking up the skirt, glad that this would be the final item, Dirk attempted to slide it on, but was disappointed when it wouldn’t come on any farther than his hips.  Taking it off, he looked at it and then discovered a hidden zipper.<br />
<br />
Undoing the zipper, Dirk once again tried to slide the skirt on, and succeeded, but was hindered when it came time to slide the zipper up. Struggling, he thought about giving up, but instead pressed onward and after a bit was rewarded when the zipped shot up and he was able to pull his hand away.<br />
<br />
Standing in front of Arianna’s full body mirror, Dirk fidgeted about, uncomfortable with the idea of wearing such items…and then he noticed his feet. Groaning in disgust, he asked himself, “How do you plan to go out if you don’t have any shoes to wear,” and turning away, he marched back to the closet and began to sift through the various shoes Arianna owned.<br />
<br />
After several minutes of this, Dirk finally settled on a pair of low heel, slipper like shoes with an open toe and an open back that laced up past the ankle. Fitting the shoes on, Dirk adjusted them until his toes weren’t quite so pinched and then sat down at Arianna’s Vanity.<br />
<br />
From the various bottles and jars, Dirk applied a light dab of perfume to his wrists and throat, much in the same way Arianna sometimes did. Next he experimented with the make-up, settling on finally a light blush to his cheeks. Satisfied, Dirk stood and standing one again before the mirror, he took in his reflection.<br />
<br />
Before him he saw a man dressed in woman’s clothing, which disappointed him. Remembering something, he returned to the vanity and searching through the jewelry box, Dirk selected a pair of clip-on earrings. Fastening them in place, he returned to the mirror, but was still unhappy about his looks. Looking at his chest, he figured that he might pass for a double A cup, one of the smallest sizes Arianna had told him once when she was going off about the size of her breast…and how she was glad she didn’t have that small.<br />
<br />
“I’ve got it,” Dirk exclaimed and turning away from the mirror, he walked across the room and back to the closet. Inside, he began to rummage through the various boxes until he found the wigs Arianna used for Halloween. Selecting a brunette coloured wig, he returned to the mirror and began to adjust it, hoping that in the end he would be able to correct the problem with his high forehead and too short hair.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, he had finally settled on a purse that matched the outfit and was now prepared to try out his wish. Standing at the front door, he breathed in and told himself, “You can do this. You seen your reflection. Compared it to the magazines Arianna has. You know that you look feminine…and if your wish goes right everyone will treat you as such. You can do this. You can do this because you look like a girl. You have practiced walking like a girl, imitating the way Arianna walks. You can do this because you have your voice at just the right pitch to sound feminine. Yes, you can do this.”<br />
<br />
Breathing in deeply again, Dirk reached for the doorknob, turned the knob and opening the door, stepped outside, dressed as a girl, hoping that someone wouldn’t make a fuss about people dressed in drag.</p>
