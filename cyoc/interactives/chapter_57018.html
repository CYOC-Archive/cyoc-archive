<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thinking that this is a dream or that you have taken some hallucinogenic drugs, you <br />
decide to go back to the dorm. Outside the mall you wait for the bus and as you're <br />
doing so, you take a look at the people round you and wonder what you would do if <br />
you really had the power to do what you imagine you had seen earlier. The bus comes <br />
and you get on. You pay the driver and then pick a seat behind a boring looking girl <br />
with short hair.<br />
As the bus moves you take a look at the flashlight again. It has two settings, dim and <br />
bright for intensity/speed of change and blue for more masculine and pink for more <br />
feminine. You switch it to pink and bright and try it again on your right hand. Almost <br />
instantly your hand narrows and your fingers lengthen. The skin tone changes and your <br />
finger nails grow longer. They look painted as if they have been recently manicured. In <br />
fact your hand is gorgeous. You stare in disbelief and hold your breath, closing your <br />
eyes. The hand is still female. You look around to see if anyone else is watching or has <br />
noticed anything, but nobody is paying you any attention. You try something else, <br />
switching it to as bright as possible, turning it all the way up and leaving it on pink. <br />
You shine it on the back of the head of the plain looking short red haired girl in front <br />
of you. Instantly, her hair grows out in long lush curly tresses. She turns to look at you <br />
and flicks her head slightly as she smiles just a little. Obviously this is the way she's <br />
always been. You are almost holding your breath with excitement as the bus comes to <br />
a stop outside the dorm. You rush through the front doors and drop the keys in your <br />
excitement to get in. When through the doors you rush as fast as you can to the dorm <br />
room. You lock yourself in the bathroom just in case your room-mate comes back.<br />
Inside the bathroom you take off your t-shirt and stare at yourself in the mirror. A little <br />
better than average looking regular white guy. Dirty blonde hair, center parted, close <br />
cropped at the side. Nose not too wide not too thin, a little bumped in the middle and <br />
a little larger than normal. Bushy eyebows, thin long mouth. Masculine square chin. <br />
Just a little bit of stubble since you haven't shaved for a couple days. Your arms are <br />
muscular and you have a barrel chest and a six pack. Your shoulders are wide and <br />
toned. There is just a little bit of chest hair. You look at your two hands and it still <br />
looks a little strange the juxtaposition of your wide guy's hand against the slender <br />
pinkish well manicured female hand. You run the pink light across your other hand <br />
which instantly changes to match it's female twin. It looks bizarre, the two slender <br />
ultra-feminine hands against the clearly male body. You wonder what your face would <br />
look like so you close your eyes and shine the flashlight all over your head. You feel a <br />
slight tingling sensation as your features change and distort. When you open your eyes <br />
you gasp, there you are but your head is this hot girl with long flowing tresses on top <br />
of this masculine body. Your eyes are a little bigger and set a little wider. Your lashes <br />
are luscious, long and dark. Your eyelids are tighter and the skin between your <br />
eyebrows and eyelids has lengthened and the contrast between your eyes and your face <br />
has heightened. Your eyes stand out. They are gorgeous. Your eyebrows have also <br />
subtly changed shape. They are arched slightly and more feline, far less bushy than <br />
before. Experimentally you flutter them and giggle as you see yourself. Shocked by the <br />
sheer femininity of the sound of your giggle you raise your beautiful graceful female <br />
hand to cover your mouth. You're gorgeous and you catch your breath.<br />
At the same time it is shocking to see your hands and your gorgeous face and long <br />
flowing lustrous hair on top of your guy's body. You shine the flashlight over your <br />
shoulders. Your shoulders narrow and contract, the muscles disappearing down to <br />
slender toned fineness. You then stretch your arms out and run the light over each arm <br />
one by one. The muscles in your arms flow, change shape and shrink too though still <br />
maintaining tone. Next you run the light over your torso, being careful not to shine it <br />
on your pecs. The top half of your body contracts a few inches and you are maybe four <br />
inches shorter than before. You can feel like you weigh a lot less on the top half of <br />
your body than before. Your six pack is now covered by a thin, evenly distributed layer <br />
of very feminine fat. Your barrel chest is gone. You are skinny from the waist up and <br />
your waist has tapered, giving your the classic wasp shaped waste. Gasping with <br />
anticipation you decide to try the pecs. You quickly shine the light on your pecs and <br />
they flow and stretch, new breasts budding where your pecs were. You figure you are <br />
an A-cup. Experimentally you lift one and let it flap back down, gently and deliciously <br />
bouncing off your chest. Looking at yourself in the mirror you are this drop dead <br />
gorgeous girl, vaguely reminiscent of your mom or your sister but much hotter. <br />
Looking down, however, you're still you. Square, stocky guy legs. <br />
You strip daintily out of your jeans and underpants, letting your junk hang free in the <br />
air and your stocky hairy legs in full view. It looks absolutely ridiculous with the top <br />
half being a gorgeous girl who should be a cheerleader. You set the pink flashlight on <br />
full power and shine it over your ass which swells out and tightens. Your hips bulge <br />
and fill in with a thin voluptuous layer of feminine fat. Your legs are still muscular but <br />
the shape of your upper thing now has a delicious curve which blends into your hips, <br />
gorgeously accentuating them. Below the knee, however, you still have hairy guy's legs. <br />
And there is your junk. Quickly you convert your lower legs and feet. The feet instantly <br />
transform to smaller, daintier feminized feet with a great pedicure. They look <br />
gorgeous. Now all that is left of your previous self is your junk. You watch it carefully, <br />
wistfully and shine the light on it. As you do so, you are aware of a curious sensation. <br />
Your scrotum skin feels like it's being split open and pulled back as it metamorphoses <br />
into labia and a tube opens up in the middle. Your balls feel link they're being <br />
absorbed and pushed back inside your stomach and then they split off in two different <br />
directions, one to either side deep inside your abdomen. Then they feel like they are <br />
growing and changing form. There is a slight pop and they settle into their new places. <br />
At the same time your cock shrinks to a small button at the top of your new lips on <br />
either side of your new vagina which fills with fresh new liquid. With surprise you <br />
stagger back slightly, feeling that your balance has changed a little, not for the worse, <br />
just different. As you step forward you notice the sway of your hips and examine <br />
yourself in the mirror. You are drop dead gorgeous. You look at yourself. You catch <br />
your breath. You run your slender fingers over your body and your face. You turn your <br />
head slightly to examine your nose. The bump is gone and you have a slender little <br />
skijump nose with a little upturn at the end. Your lips are plump and your mouth is <br />
less wide than it was before. You gasp, your heart beating like a drum and strange <br />
sensations flowing through your gorgeous new body. At that moment you hear the <br />
door in the dorm open and your room-mate comes in. You hear him shout, &quot;Heh, you <br />
there?&quot; You catch your breath, wondering what to do in case he sees you like this, <br />
caught in hesitation and unable to decide what to do. Then he calls again, &quot;Jennifer, is <br />
that you?&quot; You gasp as it comes back to you. Like in a dream you recall that you are <br />
called Pete but at the same time you recall you are called Jennifer and remember <br />
growing up as a girl. You have both sets of memories but the male side is faded as if <br />
it's a dream......</p>
