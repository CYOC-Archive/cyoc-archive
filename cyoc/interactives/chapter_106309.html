<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Boys! Don&#39;t you want some lunch?&quot; asked April.<br />
<br />
Ty, Ki, Dustin, and Justin suddenly snapped out of their thoughts and reality. They suddenly remembered that it was time for lunch--their first lunch as members of a conjoined family!<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry...moms,&quot; Dustin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we were just talking about our plans for the afternoon,&quot; said Justin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, all four of you will have time to do that AFTER you get some food in your stomachs,&quot; said Mark. This was interesting to the four brothers: since they were basically four heads on two bodies, each body must have only one stomach.<br />
<br />
As the four boys moved into the dining room, Ty whispered, &quot;This is gonna be so cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally,&quot; whispered Ki.<br />
<br />
It was an odd idea to think that more than one person could sit comfortably in one chair at the same time, but not if every aspect of the scenario is considered: the chairs were wide enough for seating two people at once, and three of the bodies sitting down in the chairs were as wide as two regular human bodies. This, however, was not the only thing that the boys were psyched about. This was the first meal that any of them were going to have in their new lives as conjoined twins and members of a family of conjoined twins!<br />
<br />
Lunch seemed normal for the most part; each conjoined sibling was able to operate their body&#39;s arms, as if everyone present had been conjoined twins for their entire lives, not just since the wishes. Still, the boys would occasionally watch their parents as they ate their lunch. June, May, and April were able to feed each of their heads thoroughly, even though their body only had two arms. Having only two heads on their body, Mark and Clark were able to feed both of their heads simultaneously, unless one head wanted to wait in order to drink or read the newspaper. Each of the boys were also able to share in this experience--after all, each of them was sharing a body with another person. Believe it or not, all four of them were able to function as conjoined eaters, just like their parents, as though they had been conjoined twins their whole lives.<br />
<br />
As soon as lunch was finished, the four boys got up from their wide chairs and walked their wide bodies towards the front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be back in time for dinner!&quot; called May.<br />
<br />
&quot;And remember, there&#39;s nothing wrong with being conjoined twins!&quot; shouted Mark and Clark.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are our dads talking about?&quot; Dustin whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should have some new memories by now,&quot; whispered Ty. Indeed, in a moment, Dustin and Justin now remembered their new backstory and the speech they got from Mark and Clark when the two boys turned fifteen.<br />
<br />
In no time, the four brothers had gotten to the park. They had always met their friends by the fountain in the afternoon, and that is exactly who they met there: Ralph, Donnie, Mike, Leo, James, and Peter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, guys!&quot; Justin shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Ki asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little hope and jealously,&quot; said Peter.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, most of us are kinda jealous that you guys have two heads,&quot; said James.<br />
<br />
&quot;We kinda want conjoined twins of our own,&quot; Mike said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Dustin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ralph said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might be cool to have two heads,&quot; Donnie said.<br />
<br />
Ty, Ki, Dustin, and Justin turned their heads towards each other, smiling at the fact that their friends wishes could come true in less than a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you guys REALLY want to have conjoined twins?&quot; Justin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, why?&quot; asked Leo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s kind of a long story,&quot; said Ki.<br />
<br />
After explaining everything that had happened--Ty&#39;s power, the wishes, and the new family--the guys were surprised to find out that Ty could use his power to grant their wishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys ready for this?&quot; Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, do it!&quot; they shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I wish that all six of our friends had been born with a conjoined twin, that their twins are aware of all that has happened, that everyone is coordinated and able to function with two heads on one body, and that everyone believes that they have all been born like this,&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
The changes started with Ralph. First, he felt his body growing wider, and indeed it was: his torso began to widen out to his right, and his legs began to become wider as well, as though their were two legs inside each pants leg. Suddenly, Ralph realized that his clothes were getting larger as well--not only were his pants growing to an extra large size, but his shirt was also growing larger and wider, and that the neck hole was stretching out. Then, a lump began to grow to the right of Ralph&#39;s head, and as it stretched the neck hole to its new size, the lump had become a duplicate of Ralph&#39;s head! Ralph now had one large body, two large legs, two arms, and two heads on his shoulders!<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome!&quot; Ralph said, &quot;How about we name you Rob?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; said the new head.<br />
<br />
One by one, the same changes occured to Donnie, Mike, Leo, Peter, and James. Soon enough, there were eight bodies present--each twice as wide as a normal human body--each with two heads on them. The names of each conjoined twin, on the left and right-hand sides of each of their bodies, were as follows: Ty and Ki, Dustin and Justin, Ralph and Rob, Donnie and Johnny, Mike and Mark, Leo and Luke, Peter and Paul, James and John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally amazing!&quot; shouted Donnie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Freaking awesome!&quot; shouted Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely rad!&quot; shouted Ralph.<br />
<br />
&quot;So cool!&quot; shouted Johnny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Best day ever!&quot; shouted James.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t this great?!&quot; asked Peter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s great!&quot; shouted Paul.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe this has actually happened!&quot; shouted John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pinch us and see if we&#39;re dreaming!&quot; shouted Rob.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think anyone is dreaming!&quot; shouted Leonard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, guys!&quot; Leo said to Ty, Ki, Dustin, and Justin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, this is the best thing that ever happened to any of us!&quot; shouted Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; Justin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you&#39;re happy.&quot; Dustin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s amazing to think that none of us were conjoined twins,&quot; said Ki, &quot;and now there are suddenly sixteen guys sharing eight bodies in the same city!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s all happened in less than a day,&quot; said Ty.<br />
<br />
As the guys sat and talked, they wondered how this could get any better. The original bodies of all eight guys had all become twice as wide, and each was able to stand up straight on two legs and feet. On top of that, each body now had two heads on each pair of shoulders. Indeed, what could happen to make this better?</p>
