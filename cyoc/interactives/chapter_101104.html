<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Inside the Anderson house, William and Martha were having a relatively quite afternoon. Doing some school related work, and trying not to end up on top of each other again. They’d been weres for almost six months, and the lust still took a little getting used to. And they knew they couldn’t go their entire life jumping on each other whenever the feeling struck them. Exercising a little self-control was good for them. <br />
<br />
William was in his office reading papers when his phone buzzed. He didn’t recognize the caller ID, but answered it anyway. <br />
<br />
“Hello?”<br />
<br />
“Mr. Anderson? Hi, it’s Harry.”<br />
<br />
“Harry, what’s up? Nothing wrong I hope.” William said, remembering how Harry’s parents had acted at the wedding. They were more against their son marrying at nineteen than his turning into a werefox. That, for some reason, was easier to wrap their heads around than his falling in love with a girl he’d only been dating for two months prior. <br />
<br />
“No, everything’s alright. At least I think it is. I was just hoping, since you’re the only other werefox I know off hand, and I can’t really ask my parents, and….”<br />
<br />
“Harry, just ask the question.” William said, chuckling to himself. <br />
<br />
“Oh, right. Sorry. Anyway, I, well WE, are… Jenny thinks she might be pregnant.”<br />
<br />
“That’s wonderful!” William blurted out without thinking. He kept Harry on the phone, but went in search of Martha to tell her the good news. She was close with Jenny, who had actually changed her. She thought of her as the daughter she hadn’t had yet. Emphasis on the yet. Since becoming weres, both Martha and William seriously considered having more children (kits). <br />
<br />
William found Martha in the kitchen, grading papers of her own. <br />
<br />
“Who are you talking to?” she asked, but William just mimed for her to listen. <br />
<br />
“Is that Martha?” Harry asked, hearing her voice.<br />
<br />
“Yes. And we’re both thrilled you and Jenny are expecting.” <br />
<br />
It was at that moment Martha started making all kinds of excited squealing noises. She kisses William, and then ran off with her own phone in her hands to talk to Jenny.<br />
<br />
“She sounds happy,” Harry commented once Martha’s screams had faded into the background. He was vaguelyly aware that Jenny, in the next room, was now screaming in unison with Martha. <br />
<br />
“I think we’re both going to end up deaf if they carry on like this.” William laughed.<br />
<br />
“Well, if they don’t make me go deaf my parents will.” Harry said softly. Everyone stopped giggling and laughing after Harry finished his sentence. <br />
<br />
“Is that what you wanted to talk about?” William asked, sitting down at the kitchen table. <br />
<br />
“Yes. You know what their reaction was to our marriage, can you imagine what they’re going to say when I tell them I’m going to be a father. I’m not even twenty yet, or finished with school!” Harry said, getting worked up again. Jenny put a comforting hand on his shoulder and tried to calm him. <br />
<br />
“I can’t not tell them. If they don’t get mad at me for knocking someone up while I’m in college, they’ll get mad at me for not telling them about their grandchild.” Harry sighed. <br />
<br />
“Don’t jump to conclusions. You only said you THOUGHT Jenny was pregnant, have you gone to a doctor yet?” Martha asked via William’s phone. Seeing as they could all hear each other, it made more sense to have one communal call instead of two. <br />
<br />
“We’re planning to go to one first thing Monday morning. We don’t have any morning classes that day, and Harry’s parents won’t be in town. His father is on a business trip, and his mom is staying with her sister for the weekend.” Jenny said. <br />
<br />
“But if she is pregnant, I have to tell them. God they’re going to murder me. Or worse, skin me alive. I’ve got plenty of fur, maybe they’ll turn me into a coat.” Harry joked, half serious. <br />
<br />
“Harry I seriously doubt your parents will do anything so drastic. You’re expecting a child, you didn’t blow up the White House.” William pointed out. <br />
<br />
“That’s like the same thing to them! They’re so damn strict about that kind of thing.” Harry said. His parents were from a relatively quiet community in Mississippi. They were raised to believe that life went according to one plan, and one plan only. Go to school, go to college, get a job, get married, have kids, retire at sixty, and then die whenever God decided to whack you. <br />
<br />
“Harry, you’re their only son. And you mom was coming around last time we spoke to them. She was pretty okay with us wanting to start a family as soon as we could. Granted I hadn’t planned on starting things so quickly, but that’s life.” Jenny shrugged. Her own parents were a little worried too, but had promised to support the two in anyway they could. <br />
<br />
“Harry, you’re a good kid. And your parents are only worried about your well being. Try to keep that in mind.” William said. <br />
<br />
“I know, I know.” Harry muttered. Jenny took the phone from him and shooed him back to the bedroom. The two were staying at Jenny’s parents’ place rather than live on campus. It was easier for them, being newly weds, and the school didn’t mind. <br />
<br />
“He’s so anxious, I’m kind of hoping the doctor says I’m just really, really late.” Jenny whispers into the phone. <br />
<br />
“Did you take a home test?” Martha asked. <br />
<br />
“It turned this weird puce color.”<br />
<br />
“Puce?” Martha and William both repeated. <br />
<br />
“Ya, I know. I couldn’t figure out what that meant either. But anyhow, I’ve got my fingers crossed for the next few days.”<br />
<br />
“How are you doing?” William asked, knowing Jenny must have a lot of her own plate. It’s one thing to be an expecting father. He knew the mother’s concerns were far more important. After all, she was the one who actually had to carry the kid around for nine months. <br />
<br />
“I’m great. I feel the same. A little freaked out too, but fine.”<br />
<br />
“If you don’t mind my asking, how did this happen? You’re on the pill aren’t you?” Martha asked. <br />
<br />
‘That’s another thing. I overslept one morning and I think I forgot to take it before I left for school. I can’t remember, it was so long ago. And I was a bit hungover, if you know what I mean.” Jenny said, a bit embarrassed. <br />
<br />
“Well don’t get too sick over this. Everything will work out. It always does in the end.” Martha said, smiling at William. <br />
<br />
“Thanks you two. I’ll let you know what happens on Monday.” Jenny said. The Andersons said their goodbyes and sat in a mystified silence for a while. Then found their bodies pressed against the other’s.<br />
<br />
“Would you like to join Jenny in the ;expecting vixen’ group?” William asked playfully. Martha started undoing the buttons on William’s shirt in response. <br />
<br />
“Do you think we’re ready for more kids? I just started working again.” she said. Once she reached the last button, she began working on his pants. William moaned in pleasure as Martha slide his pants down, and then his underwear. Her breath hit his quivering package, as small droplets of pre pattered onto the floor.<br />
<br />
William gripped Martha’s back, and felt a familiar heat rush through his body. Fur began emerging from his arms and legs, slowly creeping up to meet at his stomach. By then his claws had grown in, and Martha had worked her way out of her own clothing. She was still a naked human when William pulled her head forward, and onto his waiting rocket. <br />
<br />
“We have a long time to reproduce again.” William said in a low seductive voice. <br />
<br />
Martha kissed the tip of his prick before allowing it into her mouth. She engulfed as much as she could, waiting for the changes to reach her head. They did just at the right moment. William was seconds away from hitting his breaking point, and then Martha’s face pushed out to finish her transformation from human to fox. Her rougher tongue licked the underside of her husband’s penis.<br />
<br />
Then he came, inside her mouth, sending wave after wave of white stickiness down her throat.</p>
