<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During the week of the Outbreak...<br />
<br />
The Lyre Zoo was a small zoo, but it still received plenty of daily visitors. People were always coming in to see the animals that weren&#39;t native to their country. As such, there were plenty of people there when the Animalian Virus entered the water system of the zoo and uplifted nearly all, if not every, animal. Several people were very impressed by the changed animals and most of them were accidentally exposed to the virus as well. Several matebonds were formed between newly uplifted and newly converted that day. This is the story of how Dean became bonded with Nzinga.<br />
<br />
Dean had a project for biology class, one that focused on zoology. The students had their pick of different animals at the zoo to choose from and Dean had picked the majestic African Elephant. Right now, he was observing the resident matriarch of the zoo&#39;s elephants, Nzinga. She seem mostly indifferent to his presence, but he noticed she looked at him more often than not. Well, it certainly helped him with his sketch of her for his report. Elephants are said to be pretty smart and Nzinga seemed to have accumulated a lot of wisdom over the years. He wondered what kind of stories that elephant could tell if she could talk.<br />
<br />
Just then, there was the sound of a lot of screaming. Dean looked in that direction to see a sizeable crowd of people running this way in a state of panic. As he was looking that way, he didn&#39;t notice Nzinga suddenly stagger and lean her body against the wall. Dean couldn&#39;t see what the people were running from, but they were obviously not going to stop. Dean tried to get out of the way, but soon the crowd was upon him. They barely paid attention as they ran past, resulting in Dean being smacked quite a bit and nearly trampled. He tried to get to the side when someone stumbled into him. Dean&#39;s back soon hit the rail and was tumbling over it before he could grab onto anything. He was plummeting towards the pool in the elephant enclosure and was definitely going to be landing in the deep end. Dean had just enough time to think that he didn&#39;t know how to swim before he hit the water with a splash.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Dean groaned as he slowly came to. The first thing he noticed was that he was in the shade. The scent of his surroundings suggested that he was in the elephant house. But he felt wrong, wrong all over. Even his head felt completely different. Dean tried to sit up, the wrongness of his situation becoming more apparent. He soon started to notice that he felt a lot more contact with his skin on the floor than he ought to have, like he was naked. His attention was soon locked onto something that was most definitely not right. He could see a large grey bulge extending from his face that quickly showed to be a trunk. Dren felt the rest of his head, feeling enormous ears and large tusks. He sat up and saw that he was naked and his skin had changed from brown to grey, his feet ending that of an elephant&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Dean looked up to see something that was more bizarre than himself. She was obviously an elephant and definitely a woman. Like him, she had the head, skin, and feet of an elephant, but her body was that of a curvy giantess, though a little on the round side. She had a look of great concern on her face which was a lot more readable than a normal elephant&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to me?&quot; asked Dean, though his voice came out unsurprisingly nasally and his tusks made him lisp quite a bit.<br />
<br />
The elephant woman seemed to get the gist of what he was asking and said, &quot;You feel into the pool. You didn&#39;t come back up after I finished changing. I was pulled you out and it looked like you might have drowned. I gave you CPR as much as I could but I didn&#39;t notice this would happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? How do you know CPR?&quot; asked Dean, still sounding a little mush-mouthed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen people do it over the years,&quot; said the elephant woman, &quot;Of course, I couldn&#39;t get my mouth to yours so I used my trunk. I didn&#39;t realize I&#39;d pass over...whatever happened to me to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean&#39;s head was swimming. Somehow, there was an elephant woman in front of him telling him that she had turned him into an elephant man. The whole situation was like the surrealist dream he ever had. Eventually, he got into the presence of mind to ask, &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Nzinga,&quot; said the elephant woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nzinga? Wait, you were the elephant I was watching earlier,&quot; said Dean, his diction becoming clearer the more he talked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I saw you were watching me,&quot; said Nzinga, &quot;I was curious why.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was doing a project for school,&quot; said Dean before looking at himself again, &quot;Not like I can go back to school like this.&quot; Sure, Abby Brown might be able to go back to school as a horse, but could he go back as an elephant. That sparked a realization. Abby was changed because she was exposed to a virus, the same virus that changed all the animals on their farms. &quot;Wait, this is because of the virus. We were changed by a virus in the water,&quot; said Dean.<br />
<br />
&quot;That explains a lot,&quot; said Nzinga, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I exposed you by accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose it&#39;s better than drowning,&quot; said Dean.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let me make it up to you,&quot; said Nzinga before kneeling in front of Dean. Her trunk soon started to explore his groin. Dean jumped a bit at that. He wasn&#39;t expecting something like this, particularly from an elephant. Though he had to admit that Nzinga&#39;s boobs were kinda attractive. Before he knew it, he felt a stirring as his new sheath released his changed penis.<br />
<br />
Dean&#39;s eyes widened when he saw it. He was average before, but now he was enormous! It look like a scaled-down version of his trunk, only less flexible and prehensile. But it had a lot more length and girth than he would have expected. That thing couldn&#39;t even fit in both of his larger hands. &quot;Wow,&quot; he said, &quot;I didn&#39;t know bull elephants were packing this much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How else could they mate with us?&quot; asked Nzinga as her trunk lightly wrapped around the base of his shaft. She lowered her head and gently took the head of his penis into her mouth. Dean let out a gasp at that. He never received this kind of attention from any girl. An elephant woman was the last thing he was expecting. But still, he decided to roll with it. Besides, Nzinga was surprisingly efficient with her administrations. It didn&#39;t take long for Dean&#39;s pre to start leaking into her mouth.<br />
<br />
It took a while for Dean to notice the tingle throughout his body since he was so preoccupied with the tingling in one particular area. But eventually, Dean noticed that his body was expanding, covering more surface area than it had before. He quickly said, &quot;Nzinga, wait. Something&#39;s happening.&quot; His voice sounded noticeably deeper than before.<br />
<br />
Nzinga stopped sucking his dick and looked at Dean. &quot;You&#39;re growing,&quot; she said in surprise, her voice sounding less husky than before. She stood up before offering Dean a hand. Dean grasped it and eventually pulled himself to his feet. It wasn&#39;t that hard to stand on his elephantine feet, though it felt weird that they were so round now. As soon as he was standing, Dean could see that he was very tall, at least 9 feet. He probably ought to be larger, but that would have been too huge. He also noticed how his body had bulked up immensely. He had been a decently-built young man before, having earned his letterman jacket from his football games. But now he was a mountain of muscles, every square inch of him densely packed with fully-formed and super strong musculature. Also his tusks looked a little longer, indicating his extended maturity. &quot;You look amazing. Like a real bull,&quot; said Nzinga in awe.<br />
<br />
Dean looked at Nzinga and noticed she was shorter than him. Well, not that much shorter, maybe 8 inches. What grabbed his attention was that her shape had improved too. Her body hadn&#39;t been that bad before, but it was more matronly in figure. But it looked like her extra years had been wiped away, leaving her the equivalent of a young woman. And what a woman she was. She was as muscled as Dean, though her womanly curves were not overshadowed. Her breasts and ass were alot firmer than what they had been before. The sight of her was turning Dean quite a lot. &quot;If I&#39;m a real bull now, I&#39;m gonna act like one,&quot; he said in his deep voice.<br />
<br />
Nzinga was rather surprised when Dean pushed back against the wall. But then she felt his trunk wrapping around one of her breasts, squeezing it while the tip massaged her nipple. Nzinga moaned with pleasure as one of Dean&#39;s hands massaged her other breast and the other hand was teasing her lower lips. She had been feeling the urge to mate since she had been uplifted and she was hardly going to deny the advances of this handsome young bull. Before long, Dean was pushing his &#39;lower trunk&#39; deep into her. Dean felt a titanic surge of confidence as he plowed into the elephant cow in front of him. All thoughts of this being weird was swept aside. His pachyderm testosterone was telling him to mate with this female and he was not arguing. The two of them pushed against each other and the wall before they finally both let out a loud trumpet as Dean erupted inside of Nzinga.<br />
<br />
The two anthro elephants rumbled with pleasure as they came down from their climatic high. Dean felt a great urge to kiss Nzinga, but he wasn&#39;t really sure how to with their large trunks and tusks getting in the way. He settled for hugging her close and she hugged him back. This day was still filled with confusion, but the bond between them had definitely began growing.</p>
