<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After bath time Will got a glass of milk and some cookies, and passed right out as soon as his head hit the <br />
pillow. Megan went to the living room and turned on the tv. <br />
<br />
An hour later she checked on Will to find that was in the middle of a terrible nightmare and thrashing about <br />
violently. She rushed over to wake him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Stop! You can't! I AM an adult...&quot;, Will was half demanding half pleading.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will, Will honey, you're having a bad dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wouldn't wake up so she grabbed his shoulders and shook him while sternly but calmly telling him to wake <br />
up.<br />
<br />
Will started thrashing against Megan, as though she were the enemy from his dream. His excitement overruled <br />
the remainder of the chemicals his brain produced to hold him still while dreaming and he sat up and started <br />
trying to smack and claw at Megan.<br />
<br />
Megan was taken aback. Will's screaming woke him up. He blinked two or three times, &quot;Megan?&quot;, he asked <br />
panting.<br />
Coming back to her senses she kneeled beside him and said, &quot;yes Will, I'm here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will desperately grasped at Megan drawing her closer. He hugged her tight and when Megan was about to speak <br />
she realized that he was starting to sob. She rubbed his back and tried to comfort him but it quickly <br />
escalated and he was soon wailing. Unlike most children who are in the throws of a fit, Will was kind enough <br />
to muffle his screams in Megan's shoulder rather than directing it into her ear.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed and Will began to calm. The first time Megan tried to pull away to talk about it Will held on <br />
tight not letting her get more than centimeters away from him. A moment later she wisely asked if he was <br />
feeling better before pulling away. A few seconds passed before his arms suddenly relaxed and Megan was able <br />
to breathe. Will had been squeezing her lung. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey honey, want to talk about it?&quot; Megan had never, ever seen him this upset and was honestly not sure how to <br />
deal with it. His calm and controlled demeanor was part of her attraction to him and it was a dependable <br />
aspect to his character.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... you...&quot; The horror of the situation still wouldn't allow him to fully formulate sentences. He took a few <br />
deep breaths and started over recounting his nightmare.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was back at work, everything was like normal, I was an adult and happy. I was talking with you and we made <br />
plans for dinner. Or maybe we made plans that morning? You know how dreams are.&quot;<br />
&quot;I got back to work and all throughout the meetings and paperwork I was only thinking of seeing you for <br />
dinner.&quot; as Will said this a smile broke across his face and he practically radiated joy and love.<br />
Megan's heart began to melt even more for this man turned child. <br />
Will's face fell distant and his voice hollowed as he continued, &quot;Then I got a call. It was from your cell <br />
phone. 'Hey Babe' I answered, but it wasn't you. It was a paramedic calling to ask if I knew your blood type.<br />
He told me you were in a car accident and by the time they got there you were in shock and needed an immediate <br />
transfusion.&quot;<br />
Will paused for a minute absentmindedly working over Megan's hand as he held it. &quot;I don't even know if that <br />
makes sense&quot;, Will offered, &quot;wouldn't they run tests or use saline solution?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on,&quot; Megan offered, knowing that he wouldn't be this upset about an illogical paramedic procedure.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were in a car accident, and were dying. I got the directions to the hospital and immediately ran out the <br />
door. I don't think I even told Marv, I just bolted.&quot; Will chuckled about disregarding his boss because his <br />
boss was generally nosey and anal about making sure everyone is working while on work time.<br />
<br />
I got to my car and realized I couldn't find my keys, I was starting to get frantic and a meter man told me <br />
that I am too young to drive, I have to ride a bike. He pointed to a bike and I was too worried about you to <br />
fight. I hopped on the bike and rode to the hospital. All the while people were calling me kid, threatening to <br />
tell my parents on me and telling me I should be in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
The love on Will's face had left and was increasingly replaced with bitterness and anger as he recounted his <br />
plight. &quot;Was that it?&quot; Megan asked not knowing how to word it nicer.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Will said quietly, almost whispering. All his anger was gone as he began to put the next part into words, <br />
replaced by a sadness that doesn't belong on a child's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got to the hospital and asked to be pointed to the emergency room. The woman pointed and I ran ignoring her <br />
call to slow down. It had taken me a long time to reach the hospital on bike because I couldnt drive. I got to <br />
the emergency room and asked to see you, they said I had to be accompanied by an adult. I screamed at them <br />
that I was your boyfriend but they wouldnt believe me. I ran throughout the ward to try to find you and I <br />
finally did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan noticed how animated he was when he talked, Will exuded disgust and contempt when he was told he couldnt <br />
do something an adult could but when he talked about her there was such compassion and love that washed over <br />
him. Perhaps his brain being physically younger hasn't had time to become desensitized to the wash of <br />
chemicals this dream flooded him with, and that's why he is so... animated. Megan thought it was cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw you and got in the room, you were banged up but still so lovely. You were unconscious and I held your <br />
hand.&quot;<br />
Megan noted that Will hadn't stopped rubbing her hand compulsively since he had started about 5 minutes ago <br />
when he stopped sobbing.<br />
&quot;I was talking with you, telling you it will be okay, and that I love you. That was when security came in, <br />
apparently the bitch receptionist saw me go in and called them on me. They told me I wasnt old enough to be <br />
here, that its no place for children! I refused to leave you and the physically dragged me out. Then your <br />
machines started blaring and doctors ran in. I demanded for them to let me stay or tell me what is happening. <br />
'This is the last thing a kid should experience,' is all they told me. I fought and fought but was completely <br />
powerless. I couldnt stop them, I couldnt help you, I couldnt even help myself. And then I woke up.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that Megan realized how her practical joke was horribly damaging her loving and deeply committed <br />
boyfriend, she had been so selfish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God honey, that is a terrible dream. I'm right here, and I'm not hurt and Im not going anywhere <br />
tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will didn't say anything but he took Megan's hand and used it to caress his face. Megan was at a loss as to <br />
what to do, she wanted to fix it but knowing how deeply she hurt him now she couldn't bring herself to admit <br />
to it.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Will inhaled sharply and said, &quot;I know honey, just tell me this whole situation is just a bad dream, <br />
that I'll wake up tomorrow like none of this happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay honey, we will figure it out tomorrow, It'll be okay.&quot; Megan said with determination as she decided <br />
what to do.<br />
<br />
With the weight no longer all on his frail shoulders, Will laid back exhausted by the emotions (and from <br />
holding his girlfriend like her life depended on it.) He quickly fell back asleep.<br />
<br />
Megan scurried to the Chronivac and typed in that Will shall sleep the rest of the night peacefully with good <br />
dreams of being an adult. She applied the setting and contemplated what to do next, she had several ideas but <br />
didn't know which direction to go.</p>
