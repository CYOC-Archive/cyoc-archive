<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty willed June to freeze again. It was like hitting pause on a DVD, she just stopped. Her face was staring down at her breasts with a wide-eyed look of shock. Her arms were reaching in to feel her chest, as if they had been about to check if what was happening was real. All in all it drew a lot of attention to her now rather small chest. <br />
<br />
Ty walked around June studying her from every angle. She was okay, but clearly had (or rather was) a late bloomer. Being one himself Ty was surprised to find himself sympathizing with June. With most guys it didn't matter if you had a fine body, unless you had the tits to go with it. She must have had a hard time getting dates.<br />
<br />
Ty found himself feeling bad for his foster parents more and more. Mark had gotten his gentle spirit broken when he was younger, his dreams shattered. Ty would improve him later, make him a big and strong horse like he had secretly desired. For now, though, Ty found himself wondering why June had turned out the way she had. Unlike what Ty had done with Mark, he used his power to gently sift through the regressed June’s mind and find out her history, which he had never known.<br />
<br />
June was a rebellious and wild teenager, controlled by strict traditional parents on a farm. This was how she had met Mark, through a mutual friend and horse wrangler. June went out with her school friends, sneaked off the farm often to the outrage of her parents. Her father, an old farmer with simple tastes, beat her violently for disobeying him, which reinforced her resentment. June and her friends drank, and took long truck rides in the middle of the night out to a popular make out spot by a lake. Her parents surprised her sexuality and kept her from learning about love. In direct opposition, she lost her virginity at the age of 16 in a passionate and freeing moment with her crush, and learned to masturbate for the first time late at night when she was alone, which she did regularly and with great liberation. She excelled in high school and became extremely popular as her body began to develop later on. Her parents never cared about her as much as her more down to Earth sister and June took her first opportunity to get off the farm and start a new life, coincidentally with Mark.<br />
<br />
Ty grinned as the important images from June’s young life finished playing for him. She had been a free spirit, soaring above what she was expected to do and overcoming it. What had made her so bitter and resentful? Ty probed her consciousness again, and discovered that it was directly caused by Mark’s change in attitude, as their marriage became stale after Dustin was born and Mark’s career went down the drain. She had wanted to adopt Ty in her midlife crisis, after Mark had denied her anymore children, but it only strained their relationship more and had caused Mark to take out his rage on Ty in spite of June.<br />
<br />
Now, Ty realized, he could fix all this. Now, like Mark, he sought out her hidden desires. Something wonderful and freeing he could do for her. She loved Mark’s bestial side when they played kinky horsy in the bedroom, something it had been years since they’d done. Ty grinned, laughing as he thought she’d certainly enjoy him now that he was really the horse. Other images came to him, touchingly unique and passionate. June wanted to be free of her confinement as a housewife and a mother, she wanted to be young and beautiful and able to fly. She wanted to be free as a bird. Her deepest desire was being able to start over.<br />
<br />
Ty looked over June’s regressed body, realizing that perhaps he was already off to a good start. Ty smiled, knowing what he would do to improve her. He would give her the body she always wanted at her age. He unfroze her and hid in the corner of the room.<br />
<br />
June's hands landed on breast just as she felt a warm sensation run through her. Every inch of her began to fill out. Her slim arms and legs swelled with feminine muscle to curvaceous masterpieces. Her hair stayed the same but some faint natural highlighting emerged. Her flattish rear swelled a little, but not much. It seemed June never had liked the booty-licous look. Skin tanned slightly and Ty watched eagerly as her pubic hair disappeared. Finally June's breasts swelled, though not as much as Ty had been expecting. From maybe A cup they swelled into the C range, and held tight enough that Ty doubted a bra would be needed. C wasn't what most guys thought were big, but Ty found that they suited June well. She was definitely hot.<br />
<br />
June let out a sigh of pleasure and twirled about again, clearly she was pleased. Ty had to clamp his mouth shut, afraid he might start drooling. June gasped and her eyes went even wider. Her lips curled into a huge grin and tears welled up in her eyes excitedly. She began to shake uncontrollably and fell to the floor, laughing with delight. When she got her composure, she stood up shivering with excitement and rubbing her hands over the undeniably sexy shape that was her new form. She kept muttering, “how?” over and over again.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled and wondered what the young girl would look like when she was fully-grown. A super sexy 6’ 4” tall 22-year-old with enormous triple D breasts and a femininely sleek muscle tone appeared in his mind. Ty grinned and nodded, but he wanted to fulfill June’s dream of being able to fly instead of making her older. Free as a bird, he remembered. Did she want to be free like a particular kind of bird? He probed her mind again…</p>
