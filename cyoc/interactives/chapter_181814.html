<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sorry for the long delay. I recently suffered a pretty big loss in the family, so I needed some time away from this. But now I&#39;m back and ready to move on.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Since essentially taking over Animalia&#39;s adult entertainment industry, Miss Fabina had been doing her best both to improve conditions for establishments and employees as well as welcome newcomers who were interested in entering the business. She was also in a position to keep an eye out for Animalians who having a little more trouble adjusting to their new hormones. The latest example is also a quite prominent one. Juliet Renard-Argenté had been a pretty tight-laced woman after her conversion. She had been trying to discourage her girls from being involved in &#39;whoring&#39; themselves and had been rather miffed when the French government offered to build a stripclub on her land. Though after a few glasses of champagne, Juliet wandered onto the stage and started dancing around a bit. She actually started to open her blouse before her girls pulled her off the stage. If there was one thing that Miss Fabina was certain, it was that Animalians can&#39;t repress their libido without it backfiring in a big way. As such, she wanted Dr. Jones to take a look at her.<br />
<br />
But in the meantime, Miss Fabina had concerns of her own. Her Plastic Recycling Program was going well so far. Initially, there had been some confusion about the purpose of this program, with people sending in plastic bottles. But what the program was supposed to be about was helping people who have been given a raw deal in plastic surgery. There were quite a few woman whose employers forced them to add silicon into their bodies to make them curvier. Sometimes, this enhancement is applied at absurd proportions. As such, Miss Fabina started this program so that women can come here to have their unnatural enhancements removed and get a conversion so they could have natural Animalian curves. So there wasn&#39;t actual plastic recycling being involved, though they did do an ad campaign on Earth Day to promote both meanings of the program.<br />
<br />
While Miss Fabina welcomed victims of abusive employers, she was a lot sympathetic with girls who have abused their own bodies. There were many women who have had done plastic surgery done for the sake of vanity. While Fabina knew it was their own business, she still felt that these women who have chosen to mutilate themselves and then change their minds about it, or worse, mutilate themselves further, didn&#39;t really deserve much pity. As such, she was more reluctant to deal these girls that Ami was sending her.<br />
<br />
Fabina was aware that Asians can do horrible things in the pursuit of &#39;ideal beauty&#39;. Probably the worst she had heard of was lotus feet, where girls have their feet horrifically crushed and bound so they could wear ridiculously tiny shoes. Thankfully such practices have long since fallen out of favor and the only women who still had them are elderly. Fabina sincerely hoped she&#39;d never have to see such feet herself.<br />
<br />
But the girls she was seeing had self-mutilated themselves in a very different way. There was a subculture among Japan&#39;s youth called &#39;gyaru&#39;. Essentially, this subculture is about Japanese girls making themselves look as Caucasian as possible. And not just Caucasian, they wanted to emulate the California beach girl profile. Which often meant dyeing or bleaching their hair, lots of makeup, and, most of all, tanned skin. It might look a little uncanny, but there wasn&#39;t much harm in pursuing this line of fashion. Except that these three girls have overused the tanning salons so long that they&#39;ve developed melanoma. While not an untreatable form of cancer, the girls have opted for conversion as well. And considering there was also other forms of plastic surgery involved, they were forwarded to Miss Fabina.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
While Miss Fabina was quite open about bodily expressions, there were times where she wondered how some people can do such things to themselves. These young Japanese women looked so fake to her. And it wasn&#39;t just because of their bleached blonde hair that looked more like doll&#39;s hair or that their skin looked orange and leathery. It was pretty obvious to Fabina that these girls have also had boob jobs, considering the unnatural roundness and stiffness of their breasts. They almost looked more like mannequins than people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, girls, I hope at this point, you&#39;ve realized the error of your ways,&quot; said Miss Fabina.<br />
<br />
One of the girls, rather appropriatly named Tani, said, &quot;Yeah, we should have stuck to natural tanning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, but I think even if you went with that, it would only have meant a longer time until you got at this point,&quot; said Fabina.<br />
<br />
&quot;But people tan all the time,&quot; complained the second girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that may be...&quot; Fabina paused to check her notes, &quot;Date? Is that one syllables or two? I can never be sure with Japanese names.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s two,&quot; said Date.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, people do tan, but they do so in moderation. Too much UV exposure eventually leads to burn or skin cancer. And you three have shown a particular disregard for your bodies&#39; limits,&quot; said Fabina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, we messed up, but Animalia can makes us better, right?&quot; asked the third girl, Naya. Their English was very good, though they were trying to sound like Beverly Hills girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I want to make sure you&#39;re not all so reckless post-conversion,&quot; said Fabina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least we known what we want to be,&quot; said Tani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess; you want to be pandas or raccoons,&quot; said Fabina. She had heard of people comparing gyaru girls with pandas and raccoons, and not in a flattering way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty close,&quot; said Tani, &quot;I know I&#39;m gonna be a red panda.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m going to be a tanuki,&quot; said Date.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while she becomes a raccoon dog, I&#39;ll become a raccoon cat,&quot; said Naya.<br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; asked Fabina.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, a ringtail cat. You have them in the States.&quot; Naya pulled out her phone and showed a video, &quot;Just look at this thing. Isn&#39;t it <i>kawaii</i>?&quot; The video showed a slim animal that looked like a cross between a raccoon, a fox, and a squirrel. It was shown scampering over rocks and eating treats. The other two soon started fawning over the video, saying how cute it was.<br />
<br />
Miss Fabina was less than impressed. She wasn&#39;t about to turn them away, but she wasn&#39;t convinced these girls would behave responsibly after conversion. She&#39;ll keep an eye on them so they don&#39;t becomes nuisances.</p>
