<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff’s liquid body shot out of its tight confines into a much roomier and softer place, his body hitting a wall and pooling at the bottom of an incline. Outside, he heard two people breathing heavily and moaning happily, a fast drumbeat echoing through the tunnel he sat in. Looking up towards where he’d came from, he saw a glimmer of light behind a massive pillar. The glimmer disappeared as the pillar began to pull away, but the tunnel tightened around it, causing it to spasm before falling forward and shooting more liquid into the tunnel. The sudden jet hit Jeff like a truck, splattering him on the walls of the tunnel and sending part of him further down, out of view of the light. Jeff, unable to cope with the pressure, closed his nonexistant eyes and slept to the rhytmic breathing of the two lovebirds, both still intertwined.<br />
<br />
————————<br />
<br />
Jeff awoke a while later in what he’d assume was morning, but he couldn’t be sure, as all he could see was darkness. Despite that, he was refreshed by the nap; and by the sound of it, the lovebirds had been too. The three of them yawned in unison; which was when Jeff realized that he both had a mouth and that it was obstructed by something.<br />
“Good morning, sugar,” said a female voice with a giggle, “I see your Beast is ready for another round~”<br />
As she said this, Jeff felt his body shake back and forth, the obstacle remaining in place. Jeff tightened his lips instinctually, causing a male voice to moan, “And he’ll be giving it everything he’s got.”<br />
With a flash of bright light, Jeff’s world finally had shape. He peered out from between gigantic flesh coloured mountains upon the crotch of the most well endowed man Jeff thought he’d ever seen: and he had his cock in his mouth!<br />
With a thrust, he hilted himself in Jeff’s mouth, a wave of pleasure radiating out of him as a girlish moan echoed from behind him.<br />
Inside, Jeff could feel every inch of cock, the Beast continuing to swell to its full size before it was slowly pulled out.<br />
With another thrust, it was shoved back in, still swelling even larger. Jeff couldn’t believe that a penis could’ve ever gotten this big, as it began to swell around a bend in his throat; each pump of blood through it sending pulses of pleasure through him and his host. As it withdrew, Jeff tensed, the pain from pulling out triggering a reflex within him.<br />
“Come on, baby,” he said, slapping her ass, “don’t tell me you’re losing your edge.”<br />
The slap sent shockwaves through Jeff, who untensed immediately, his host gasping, “I think I tightened up while we slept.”<br />
The Beast didn’t let up, however, as it continued to withdraw until only the tip was left inside. Jeff looked upon the beast in its full glory for the first time. Its form was that of legend: at least 13 inches long in its current form, at least three inches in girth, and not an imperfection or unsightly vein in sight. It was the dildo every girl dreamed of attached to a living thing.<br />
Its owner then said, “Well, we’re just gonna have to teach it again, won’t we?”<br />
With an almighty thrust, his hips collided with Jeff’s host’s, Jeff deepthroating the entirety of it, his whole body tensing involuntarily as he and his host climaxed. After minutes of bliss, Jeff regained control of his throat and began trying to reinflate the now smaller Beast. Rhythmically massaging it deeper, it quickly regained its size.<br />
The beast’s owner stood silent and still for a moment before asking, “Are you trying to milk me?”<br />
“Not... me...” Ellie panted inbetween moans, “My a... asshole... its doing it...”<br />
“Well,” he said, patting the soft, mountainous cheeks, “it’s gonna have to work harder.”<br />
Jeff, spurred on by his words, worked even harder. He worked for what felt like days, his host’s moans and the occasional slap of her cheeks helping keep his stamina up. Finally, with a powerful wave sent across the beast, it began to swell even bigger. It swelled more and more until, with a final squeeze, all three came together. Jeff tightened around Beast as it dumped gallons down Jeff’s eager throat, which swallowed every last drop. Beast’s owner collapsed on top of his own, but she didn’t seem to mind.<br />
As Beast’s supply slowly drained away, Jeff’s grip loosened: they were all very tired. Beast’s small, deflated form was slowly pulled out of Jeff’s mouth, sealing Beast’s seed inside. With Beast’s owner out of the way, Jeff was finally able to see the rest of the room. As he looked around, he found himself slightly confused, as it looked familiar, but he couldn’t place why. While he studied the room, he could hear some idle conversation between hosts, most of which he didn’t pay attention to.<br />
At the end of it, he heard Beast’s owner exclaim through a yawn, “Wow, it’s still pretty late, and I have work tomorrow.”<br />
A pair of frilly red panties was pulled up, obscuring Jeff’s vision slightly, as he was planted firmly against a bed, the cheeks crashing together, sealing him in a sweaty, musky cavern. Jeff couldn’t think of a better place to sleep.<br />
His host patted the mattress with a giggle, “Come to bed, then.”<br />
She turned off her bedside light and rolled onto her side, holding open the covers. Beast’s owner clicked off his light and slid in next to her, the two of them snuggling together happily.<br />
“Good night, sugar.”<br />
“Good night, Ellie.”</p>
