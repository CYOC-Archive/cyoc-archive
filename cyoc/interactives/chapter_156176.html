<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dusti sneaked through the halls as stealthily as a Gravid lupine broodmother could Hope to. That is to say, rather poorly and clumsily. She peaked around corners, but she had a hard time not letting her full womb from peaking out a few moments before her head could. Luckily, the one guard who seemed to be on duty near her destination was snoozing against a wall. His helmet tipped over his eyes. He seems like some sort of mix between a panther and a wolf. With a feline tail and a more cat shaped snout somewhere between feline and canine.the muscular sentry  could easily overpower, outrun, and probably to be honest out think Dusti in her compromised state.<br />
<br />
She gingerly tries to push open the heavy wooden door and it let out a damning squeak that she was sure would wake the guardian. To her surprise it did not. She tries to use her arms to push in the door, but it was way to heavy. She then had a bright idea, and levy’s the ponderous weight of her tits and belly against the door and it opens in one Smooth motion. Closing silently behind her. None being the wiser.<br />
<br />
She smiled and looked down at her pregnant belly her breasts laying heavily on the bulge. “I don’t know what I’d do if I wasn’t pregnant. These tits would kill my back for one if they didn’t have you lovely’s to lay on.” Dusty noticed what she was saying again and grew red in the cheeks. “Those changes can’t come quick enough...”<br />
<br />
On a shelf in the room there are a number of vials filled with strange pink liquids. A placker on the wall is obscured. Dustin didn’t have time for this, her mental changes were catching up to her physical  one’s. She took the one labeled with the highest numerical  order, popped the cork and chugged it down. <br />
<br />
She threw the vial to the ground and waited. Suddenly she felt a general heat in her body, like her metabolism was going into overdrive. She planted heavily and sat down. What seemed like years of built up fat seemed to just dissipate into vapor. Her pear shape body gradually remolded itself, stretch marks disappeared as her expansive ass and thighs refined themselves into an attractive and still large, but much more formly lower body. Something that any woman would dream of having, with long svelte legs and a juicy, but not obscene rump that would turn the head of any stud in town, enough for a good handful of plush delight and with a decent, though not overbearing amount of muscle too. Dusti’s chest likewise shrank into a more managable size, easy DD bordering on E, with smaller areoles and less pronounced nipples. Her waist contracted and allowed for an easy hourglass form. Throughout the process Dusti became incredibly aroused. Falling on her behind and massaging her shrinking breasts and fiddled with her sopping cunny. She ignored it before, expecting it to be blown out after what she could only assume was repeated intensive use. Both in birth, and no doubt in the relentless dicking Ty gave her. But now, she was feeling younger and younger. Her flower was a bit wide before, but through the serum it seemed to be getting tighter and tighter. Not virginal, but definitely more delicate. This was the first time she really experimented, and feeling her sensitive inner folds gave her a bolt of bliss unknown to her before. <br />
<br />
Before she could continue however, she felt her pregnancy  go down. This immediately struck her out of her trance “my babies” she thought, snapping her eyes open in maternal fear. She didn’t consider what would happen to them in all this. Dusti could maybe handle giving her pups up to another breeder, but, having them just disappear... when they were this far along too. It. It felt wrong. She watched in fear as her belly decreased in size and weight going from 50 pounds to 40 pounds to 30, to 20. She was bitting her lip hoping she didn’t make a choice she would regret, but thankfully her baby bumb stopped  at about 15 pounds. No longer an obscenely large protrusion, but still a good bit larger than humans at full term.<br />
<br />
She rubbed her more manageable belly in abject joy even sniffling a little at her good fortune.<br />
<br />
However gratitude changed back to carnal desire once again, but this time explicitly with the now obscenely erotic idea of breeding and giving birth over and over again. Contrary to the physical changes, the potion seemed to have the exact opposite effect mentally. “Momma loves you all...” Dusti cooed to her pups in her womb as she furiously fingered herself off to the idea of a large imposing wolf morph bending her over and pumping in another batch of perfect puppies. <br />
<br />
Who was this wolf? Dusti thought panting deeply and licking her long dire wolf  canines. The outline in her mind became clearer and clearer until she recognized Ty. a rage boiled in her bosom and she refused to get off to the man who did all of this. At the moment of highest pleasure just before she orgasm, she stole herself. Ripping her paw away from her slit and denying The image of Ty her first conscious female orgasm. If a bitch had ever had blue balls. It was Dusti. <br />
<br />
She closed her fist for a moment in rage and tried to cool off. She was incredibly horny, but she began to clear her mind. <br />
<br />
She stood up from the puddle she was forming  and distracted herself from the bad taste of Ty by exploring her new form. <br />
It was so much more comfortable, she tried stretching in ways that she couldn’t before, and even with her rather large belly bump, things were a massive improvement. She developed a decent amount of muscle. Now that she sees it. Not enough to compete with the guards and it wasn’t very visible, but her general physical attributes were much improved. Not to mention she looked bloody hot, she didn’t mind to admit squeezing her now pert breasts confidently and reveling in her feminine features.<br />
<br />
Her stomach was still a bit of a hinderance, but now she felt at least capable of looking out for herself. Now just to find a way out of here.</p>
