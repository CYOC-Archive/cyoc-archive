<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Johnny opened the door to the right, which led out onto a nice wide veranda that wrapped around the side to the back of the house. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, this is cool!&quot; Thought Johnny, as he stepped outside onto the porch. He has no idea the property was this large. Being more the outdoorsy type, he decided to explore around outside a bit. Maybe get a lay of the land. <br />
<br />
Walking around the back of the house on the veranda, he heard some animalistic noise. Johnny, ever the lover of animals, stepped off the porch onto the spongy wet grass of the back yard. <br />
<br />
&quot;There it is again&quot; he thought as he heard the honking of some beast back there. <br />
<br />
Walking deeper into the yard, he suddenly was tackled from behind! He started to scream in fright, but someone had grabbed him and gagged him from behind! A moment of terror, before everything went black!<br />
<br />
It wasnt long before young Johnny &quot;came-to.&quot; With a groan, he began to blink away the bleariness from his eyes. Disoriented in the dark, he slowly lifted his head to look around. Something wasn&#39;t right. He felt....off. Different, somehow. <br />
<br />
&quot;It worked! It Worked! Holy....HOLY CRAP! IT WORKED!!! I CAN SPEAK AGAIN! I HAVE TWO LEGS!!! <br />
<br />
&quot;Harry!? That&#39;s you!? You&#39;re now that kid!?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Kid? Kid!? I&#39;m....I&#39;m a KID!? I&#39;m....I&#39;m....I&#39;M. A . KID! Holy crap! I&#39;m not only human, but I am YOUNG!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So. It DID work, Harry!? You&#39;re no longer that donkey!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m....I&#39;m no longer a donkey! I&#39;m not a donkey! I&#39;m....I&#39;m...FREEEEE! WOO-HOO!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaaawww...?&quot; Johnny breathed out confusedly as he attempted to stand up. His head felt all thick and cotteny. Johnny was confused as hell. It was dark. He couldn&#39;t move properly. Everything felt all weird and wonky. His face....hell, his body....felt all bloated and his joints were achy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeee hhhhaaaww....?&quot; He brayed, trying to ask &quot;what is going on?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My voice,&quot; he thought. &quot;What&#39;s happened to my voice?&quot; &quot;Heeeeee hhhhaaaww.....&quot; He tried again, unable to speak. <br />
<br />
Still lying awkwardly on the ground, he tried pushing himself up to stand up. Something was wrong with him! Seriously. Wrong! <br />
<br />
&quot;HAAAAAWWWW!&quot; He brayed loudly and outwardly with a heave, using his &quot;arms&quot; and &quot;hands&quot; to push himself up onto.....all fours! <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m no longer a donkey!&quot; He heard the same clear voice of some kid. &quot;I....I can&#39;t believe it! I&#39;m actually a human!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who the hell is talking?&quot; Thought Johnny as he shoot his head in the attempt to clear out the cob webs. He was still terribly confused and disoriented.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear brother! You ARE a human again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh....oh thank God! Thank you Jesus!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaawww.....heeeee haaaaawww....?&quot; Johnny tried speaking again, in that strange hoarsely, nasally, and raspy animalistic voice of his. <br />
<br />
With a few outward puffs and snorts, he tried again:<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeee hhhhaaaww.....&quot; Then stopped as his vision finally started to clear. He was able to FINALLY begin to take in his surrounding, just as a light suddenly flashed on from nearby. He was blinded once again (for the moment), and sent back into a deep state of confusion as the conversation between two random people continued;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do with HIM?&quot; the second voice asked. &quot;Female voice?&quot; thought Johnny. <br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno and I don&#39;t care! But I can see! I can REALLY, REALLY see! Everything is sharp and crystal clear now! I want a mirror! I wanna see myself in a mirror! &quot; Piped up the young boy enthusiastically.<br />
<br />
Eyes adjusting to the bright light, Johnny blinked a few times as he was trying to figure out why he couldn&#39;t lift an arm and a hand up to wipe at his eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you furnish me a mirror, Bella? Please!? I really wanna see what I look like! And it better be good too!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it is! Yeah, you&#39;re some young kid now. But at least he&#39;s pretty cute. A handsome young boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two shadowy figures that Johnny was having a hard time to focus his eyesight on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeeeeeeeeeee HAAAAAAaaaawwww.... Heeeeeee hhhhaaaaaaww.....Heewwww HAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaawwww&quot; Johnny brayed once again, trying to get these two random peoples&#39; attention while trying to ask who they were. What was going on. Where he was. But. Well. He couldn&#39;t seem to actually SPEAK! And....that.....NOISE that was replacing his speech.....<br />
<br />
&quot;What....is....going on....?&quot; He thought slowly and with growing dreadas his eyesight was clearing a bit more. Not TOO much, but enough to have some serviceable sight. <br />
<br />
He finally began to look around, but strangely couldn&#39;t see too well forward. But he could see from side to side. And what he saw as he turned his head to the left and looked out of his left eye, was a very bloated. Very furry. Very animistic loaf-shaped, gray-colored body. A black shadow flicking in and out of view. A black shadow that was....registering as a....as a....as a....TAIL!? <br />
<br />
&quot;HEeeeeew haaaaawww....?&quot; Johnny brayed again in disbelief as thing were beginning to clock in place in his mind. <br />
<br />
Looking down, he saw where he thought his arms and hands were. And instead, saw the front legs of....of.....of......a.....DONKEY!? <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeee haaawwww.......heeeee hhhhaaaww.....?&quot;he brayed again unintelligibly, still trying to ask his questions. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well. I think he deserves to know what happened at any rate,&quot; said the female voice, continuing on after just explaining to the first voice how he&#39;s a handsomely cute young kid after he interrupted her when she asked what they &quot;should do with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah! But can you PLEASE just furnish a mirror?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, alright fine!&quot; said the female. &quot;But you gotta share! That boy now in possession of your former body deserves to see what he has become, and will remain for the rest of his days.&quot;<br />
<br />
More senses were coming to Johnny, as he felt movement on the top of his bloated skull, wafts of terrible smells invading his nostrils....and ...a BONER! between his legs!<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh....oh God!&quot; Johnny thought, as he was noticing his body was in the throes of a VERY MALE horny feeling! <br />
<br />
Meanwhile,the boy was freaking out as he was checking himself out in the mirror. He WAS a really handsomely cute young kid! A young boy with very strong Italian features! Very thick, very dark hair. Big soft chocolatey bruwn eyes. Nicely even tan skin. Flawlessly smooth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeee hhhhaaaww....heeee hhhhaaaww....heeee hhhhaaaww...&quot; Brayed Johnny. Still trying to speak. To say something! Anything! <br />
<br />
Shaking his head, he looked back at the VERY bloated donkey body that was at a VERY wrong angle for him to view it. <br />
<br />
&quot;So. Um. Hey! Um.... Kid?&quot; Said the female. &quot;Hey. Um. Look here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Johnny stopped braying for the moment as he craned his attention in the opposite direction. Still quite the horny adult male beast! But still hadn&#39;t fully registered that he was no longer human. <br />
<br />
&quot;Harry. Move!&quot; she commanded. &quot;Or do you want to go back onto all fours again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No, please!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then. Move!&quot; She commanded him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So. Um. Anyway. It&#39;s like this. You,whoever you are, are now a....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Johnathan!&quot; Piped up the kid. &quot;Jonathan Standish! That&#39;s my name now! That&#39;s who I am! I found his....uuuhhh....MY wallet now. It has a school ID in it, with his.....MY picture!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaaawww!!! Heeee hhhhaaaww!!!&quot; Brayed Johnny. &quot;I&#39;m Jonathan!&quot; He tried saying, but to absolutely no avail! <br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s makes YOU ....HARRY!&quot;said the boy in a change of voice with more mischief in it. <br />
<br />
*SIGH* sighed the female. &quot;This house. This property. It contains magic! Long story. Basically, I had already explored this house and discovered its magical properties. <br />
<br />
&quot;You see, I had played a prank on my fat slobby middle-aged brother with a bit of transformation magic. He was 47 years old at the time. Morbidly obese. Over 450 pounds, and only 5 feet, 8 inches tall. Just an absolutely disgusting fat slob who stunk to high-heaven and couldn&#39;t care for himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;To teach him a lesson of personal hygiene, I brought him to this house in order to turn him into a donkey! A big fat, even smellier donkey! Gave him big, heavy, nuclear-orange-colored, almost greenish moldy teeth outlined in black. A heavy smelly discharge from his huge black donkey dick anytime he pees and ejaculates. Made his body incredibly horny, and willing to be fucked in his ass by other make donkeys. Horses too! <br />
<br />
&quot;Basically, made his life a living nightmare. It was only supposed to be for a week. And to scare him into better eating and hygiene habits. Little did I know, only one type of magic can be performed on anyone. It becomes permanent. So my brother&#39;s body is now in a permanent state of donkeyhood. &quot;<br />
<br />
Johnny was listening with some patience to all of this, as he was still becoming more away about the state of his being. His mouth was extremely sour and slimy. His nostrils were flaring, and the feeling of large ears on the top of his skull twitching. Johnny was starting to get a shocked-like sinking and disgusted feeling. Despite all these clues registering in his mind, he was still in denial. He was still Johnny.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was two years ago, now,&quot; continued the female. &quot;But there was still one way I could free my brother. I could use a different type of magic I hadn&#39;t yet used on him. I had already used transformation magic to twist and grow his body into a large, 1200 lb obese donkey. I had used love magic to turn him into a bisexual donkey. Lust magic to make him horny. Mental magic to make his body desire to be the bottom of gay equine sex, and to always be hungry to keep stuffing his face with as much food as he could engorge. I extended his life span to that of a normal human life span, despite the usual health risk of being so overweight and unhealthy. That way, he wouldn&#39;t de on me, even if he has a massive coronary.<br />
<br />
&quot;But,&quot; she continued. &quot;I had not yet used a body swap spell. I promised him that I would stay with him in this barn in this backyard and swap him with the very first person that steps foot onto this property.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been over two years. In that time, he has put on another 250 lbs of weight on YOUR frame. 1,450 lbs in total. So. Well. You were the first person I saw. And now.....&quot;<br />
<br />
Here, she stepped aside to reveal a large mirror....<br />
<br />
&quot;You are no longer Jonathan. You are now Harry. You are now nothing but a fat, slobby, obese DONKEY named HARRY! &quot; <br />
<br />
In sheer and utter terror, Johnny realized he was looking at his own reflection! A reflection of a donkey that was indeed, so fat, it looked like a balloon about to burst! <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaaww-&quot; Johnny brayed outwardly softly. In shock, awe, and growing terror, he was frozen in place for several horrifying moments. Large muzzle slightly open. He then saw his former body step up next to him. He saw the familiar reflection of it in that same mirror, except not in the usual face-n angle he was used to. He was looking DOWN at the top of his dark fluffy-haired head, and the side of it.....<br />
<br />
&quot;No....no...I&#39;m not a donkey...&quot; Johnny thought in terror. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when it all clicked in place. He knew his denial was empty. At the same time, he FELT the entire shape of the body that now contained his entire essence. His entire being was now stuck in the form of a.....DONKEY! <br />
<br />
&quot;HAAAAaaaawww!&quot; He breathed out hoarsely, using the last of his breath in his donkey&#39;s body&#39;s lungs after holding it for so long. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeee....&quot; He breathed in raggedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;HAAAAAAAwwwww!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Heeeeee......<br />
Haaaaawww....<br />
Heeeee....haaaww...heeee hhhaaww heee haawwheehhaawwhehhaawhehaw<br />
<br />
His mind beginning to work at a furious pace, as he no longer has any hands! He has the strange mostly numb sensation of immobile blocky hooves! He was stuck to a four-legged stance. He could see and FEEL those ridiculously humongous ears on top of his long and wide skull! He had a fucking TAIL!<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeehhaawheehhaawherhaaww,&quot; he was hyperventilating. Unable even to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a donkey, I&#39;ma donkey, I can&#39;t be a donkey, I&#39;m a donkey, I don&#39;t want to be a donkey! Please...please...shit! I can&#39;t talk....I can&#39;t talk! I can&#39;t...I can&#39;t...fucking....SPEAK!? <br />
<br />
&quot;HAAAAAAWWWWW!?&quot; He brayed out loudly with his final realization:<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t able to even speak! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhhaaaww! Heeee hhhaaww heeee hhhaaawww!&quot; He was braying more evenly now, trying desparately to talk! To say something! ANYTHING! But he couldn&#39;t! Johnny couldn&#39;t speak! Every word he tried saying only came out in an unintelligible bray! <br />
<br />
The lack of hands and the ability to at least write, or even type, has also entered his chaotic panic-driven thoughts as he bent his head down. Baring his large half-rotten smelly unbrushed teeth out, his thick black lips curled backwards, the fat smelly donkey tongue straight out, stomping his right front hoof on the ground, Johnny began to bellow. Louder and long than ever:<br />
<br />
&quot;HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaawwwww..... Heeeeeeeeeeeeee HAAAAAAAAAAaaaawwww..... Heeeeeeeee HAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaawwww!&quot; <br />
<br />
His mind was trapped! Trapped in a prison in the form of a DONKEY! Worse, a fat, smelly, disgusting, ugly donkey! His mobility was excruciatingly limited, even more so due to his obesity! Unable to express his emotions other than the loud, obnoxious, and ragged, high-pitched, nasally braying of a jackass; unable to clench fingers and toes that don&#39;t exist, or bend his arms and legs in a more flexible fashion, especually considering they were holding his entire bulk of a body upright on all foues.....all of his passions were directed to two other places:<br />
<br />
His thick tail and his HUUUUUUGE and VERY male, VERY black, and VERY donkey dick! And that very dick was rapidly becoming frozen in place in the form of a really hard, black, steel pole. Straight as an exclamation point.  !</p>
