<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A middle aged women stepped into the room, carrying a small bag. She was wearin a basic uniform, with the word Trainer printed on her shirt. A small nametag showed that her name was Diana.<br />
“Mike, please remove your headphones and stand up.”<br />
Mike complied without a hint of resistance. Completely obedient to any command he was given.<br />
“Now, remove all of your clothing and belongings. Place them in the bag attached to the back of your chair.”<br />
While Mike stripped, the trainer pulled out a diaper and a bottle of powder. The bottle was labeled ‘Obedience & Comfort’. She sprinkled the power on the inside of the diaper. She also removed a bottle of clear liquid. The label read, ‘Super Bowel Enhancer. Fast acting. Adds nutrients needed to pee and poo. Causes a rapid production of waste to develop over 15 minutes and guarantees that the next bowel movement will be able to fill a diaper. Do not use more than once a week.’<br />
Turning to the now naked Mike she instructed him to put on the diaper. Once it was in place,  she gave him a pair of grey sweatpants, a matching shirt with the word ‘student’ printed on the front, and a black fabric collar with several electronic lights. She told Mike to drink the entire bottle of Super Bowel Enhancer and put on the new clothes. Once he was dressed, she began to speak.<br />
<br />
“You are completely obedient and will do whatever I say. You will only obey me and anyone I tell you to obey. You will refer to me a ‘Trainer’ or ‘Ma’am’, even when awake. You are a good boy. If you ever hear the phrase, ‘Mike 7 Obey 9 Time 2 Husky’ you will return to this state of complete obedience, but only if it is said by myself, a digital recording, or someone who I tell you can give you commands. Every time you obey or do what you are told you will return to this state more easily. even if you are not in this state and do what someone tells you to, it will still make it easier for you to return to this obedient state. When you wake up you will not remember anything, unless you are told to. However even though, the awake version of you won’t remember, he will follow out any commands I told you to do while awake. Repeat what I just said ten times.”<br />
<br />
Mike spoke in a happy voice, as he repeated Diana’s words. He was happy to obey her. He was a good boy and good boys obey.<br />
<br />
“You wear a diaper because good boys can’t use toliets unless they are told to. You will always wear a diaper. You will change them before you go to bed and when you wake up. In your bathroom you will find a machine instead of a toilet. When you sit in it with a diaper on it will remove your diaper. Afterwards you will take a shower and clean yourself completely. Afterwards you will sit in the machine again and it will place a new diaper on you. You will not notice your diaper or the machine when you are awake. The diaper will appear as a pair of normal underwear and the changing machine will simply be a normal toilet. You will remember putting on underwear. You will not remember using the machine. Repeat what I said back to me 10 times.”<br />
<br />
Mike obeyed instantly. Once again, he changed Daina’s orders back to her.<br />
<br />
“Do you need to shit, Mike?” Diana asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Ma’am. I need to shit.” Mike replied.<br />
<br />
“You cannot release your bowels until after you finish repeating the following words 10 times. Good boys shit and piss themselves whenever they need to go. That’s what your diaper is for. Every time you piss yourself you are admiting that you will obey. Every time you shit you are pushing out your ability to resist your commands. When you are awake you will not remember using your diaper, nor will you notice when you use it. Instead if you try to remember using the diaper, you will instead remember using a toilet. However subconsciously you will know that you are filling a diaper like a good boy. Everytime you try to remember releasing your bowels, whether you are awake or in trance, you will feel happy because you obeyed. Every time this happens all of every command you have been given will become 10 times easier to obey. If you are in a public place, you will not show any sign thank you are using your diaper. Your body will continue acting without any outward signs. If you are not in a public area you will get down on all fours like a dog. You will shit like a dog, squaring down on all fours. You will piss like a dog. On all fours, with one leg lifted up. You will always treat anywhere you are during training as a private area. If you are told by me, a digital recording, or anyone I give command of you to the phrase ‘Everywhere 3 Is 9 Private’, you will treat everywhere as a private are until you hear the phrase ‘Someplace 8 Is 4 Public’. Every time you shit or piss like a dog it will reinforce the idea that you are a dog to be 10 times stronger in addition to the reinforcement of other commands. It feel good to release your bowels, because you are a good boy. You are a good dog.’ Now repeat the commands and once you have release you bowels like a proper dog.”<br />
<br />
Mike repeated the phrase back to Trainer. Each time he repeated his commands he felt a wave of pleasure wash over him. He was a good dog. Once he repeated the commands for the tenth tim, he suddenly felt a great pressure. Dropping down on to all fours like a good dog, he let go of any control and released his bowels. His diaper swelled as an insane amount of sit and piss filled it. Not a drop escaped the diaper, but Mike’s butt had inflated by nearly an inch. It felt good to release his bowels. It felt good to release control. It felt good to obey. He was a good dog. The smell of waste filled the air. Evidence of Mike’s deed.<br />
<br />
“Your diapers have an electronic seal. This will be activated whenever you are in a public area. However, even if no one else can smell your piss and shit, you will smell it. And the more you smell it the easier it is to obey. Repeat this back to me 10 times.” <br />
<br />
Once Mike was finished, Diana looked at her watch. It was about 6:00. Time to wake him up for today.<br />
<br />
“Stand up and follow me.”<br />
<br />
Diana led Mike down the hall. Turning left, down a hall labeled Housing A. They then went into an elevator and Diana pressed floor 2A. After exiting the elevator she led Mike toward the single door labeled 2A. This was the only door other than the elevator. TheyShe then gave Mike his final commands for the Session.<br />
<br />
“When I close the door, you will repeat the following 10 times and then you will wake up. ‘When you wake up you will remember watching a generic dog training video and talking with me shortly afterwards, before heading to your room, which you will. You will remember changing into these clothes and will not notice your collar. You will only remove your collar when you shower and will immediately place it back on your neck. When you remove it you will place it on a small charging dock labeled collar that is in your bathroom. You will not remember doing this but you will do so anyway. You will always shower for at least 15 minutes. You will not remember bring any belongings with you. You will not find anything strange about your room. You will be staying in this room until you are told otherwise. Dinner will be brought to you at 6:30 pm and you will eat whatever it is. You will be ready for bed by 7:15 pm and asleep by 7:30 pm. You are a good boy and good boys sleep with only their diaper and collar on. You will wake up when your alarm goes off and eat the food that will be out on the table. You will be ready for training by 7:30 am. You will not leave this room until I come to get you unless ordered otherwise. You do not need any toiletries besides a toothbrush and toothpaste. The shower already has soap and shampoo. You do not need deodorant.  You are a good boy. You are a good dog. Good boys obey commands. Good dogs obey commands.<br />
<br />
Diana then left the apartment. Closing the door behind her. Mike repeated his orders ten times before waking up.</p>
