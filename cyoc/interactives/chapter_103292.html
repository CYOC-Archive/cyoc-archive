<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You are effectively the grandmother of every baby fur alive. It&#39;s natural you want to protect them, the way they&#39;ll wish to protect you. And the &#39;upgraded&#39; baby furs will benefit from your teachings while you&#39;re able. Just be careful, just because you can&#39;t become a baby fur due to the nature of the spell, doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be turned into one of Princess&#39; imps. You&#39;ll be stripped of every scruple and all empathy you have... you&#39;ll be just another of chaos&#39; adopted daughters. That is the dark side of childhood. That&#39;s why the baby furs represent the light side.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can we tell the not-friends about the imps?&quot; Sammy asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;They either won&#39;t believe you, or the new wave of fear or aggression will be just the beacon needed for more imps to enter this world before the fence is finished. I believe you&#39;ve seen the black space suits, humans are developing ways to protect themselves from the magic of the baby furs... and the fence will remain open allowing imps to enter. This is why all were supposed to be oblivious to the changes when they happened. So please, don&#39;t share this chat with those not in the know, it&#39;ll only HELP the imps.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We promise,&quot; Sammy The Fox said. <br />
<br />
Jessy for her part... looked super excited. Maybe The First Fur could turn her into a Tanooki and she&#39;d be able to talk to animals after all! <br />
<br />
Sammy looked at Jessy, and knew what his Bestest Friend was thinking. But he remembered his talk with  Trevor the Lab. He thought of their talk about mermaid baby furs, and made him wonder about say fairy type baby furs, everyone else would be a giant to them. <br />
<br />
Sammy asked, &quot;Charlotte. If a baby fur is changed into a mythical baby fur, would they have to give up anything from their old lives as baby furs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlotte replied, &quot;It all depends on the baby fur. Some would have to give up something, others wouldn&#39;t have to give up anything. But it would kinda defeat the POINT of you, if you were SAD about it. If a baby fur would be SAD about becoming a mermaid or fairy type baby fur for instance, then they wouldn&#39;t be able to become one to begin with! You can&#39;t become a type of mythic baby fur if it would make you unhappy, since that would just weaken your link the chain. If there was a baby fur who really liked eating, then they couldn&#39;t become a golem baby fur because they wouldn&#39;t be able to do that anymore.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jessy&#39;s head spun kinda confused. Sammy nodded mostly understanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we go to see the First Fur right now?!&quot; Jessy asked excited. <br />
<br />
Bella said, &quot;It is why you and Sammy came all the way here isn&#39;t it?&quot; She felt warmer, at least knowing that all of this at least served some purpose, and felt determined to protect Sally from this &#39;Innocent Malice.&#39; Along with all the innocent baby furs. A planet inhabited forever by immortal toddlers to balance out a world inhabited by immortal brats, Bella admitted she hadn&#39;t seen that coming, then again, that was often the way of fate. <br />
<br />
Sammy thought about it... while he&#39;d felt sad about finding out that... indeed it was important the whole world became baby furs... he HAD come all this way to meet the First Fur, and it felt wrong to just turn around and go away now. And if Jessy had her heart so set on becoming a Tanooki, then maybe he would become a kitsune too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come with us Charlotte! I bet The First Fur would love to meet you too!&quot; Jessy said happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Charlotte shook her head. &quot;The few who know of me the better. I only revealed myself to you, because it was necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Jessy blinked. <br />
<br />
&quot;So where does the First Fur live?&quot; Sammy The Fox asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t miss it. Just look for the giant magic sand castle that looks like it came right out of a fairy tale. Bunnie, Cheetah, and Horsey will be there to show you around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So every baby fur who first becomes that animal really changes their name to something like that?&quot; Sammy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Except for Sally, The First Fur, it has to do with the nature of Bella&#39;s spell originally meant to bring the toy golem to life.&quot;  <br />
<br />
+<br />
<br />
In another universe, which Sammy&#39;s universe had been wrapped around. <br />
<br />
Princess, The First Imp, sat on her very oversized throne. In the highest tower of her castle, a fortress that ran as deep as it reached high. It used to be a school. Then a unexceptional little girl from an completely unexceptional family became the first of chaos&#39; adopted daughters. And she&#39;d turned the school eventually into her castle, and her classmates and teachers into the first of the imps. Starting with her best friend, followed by their families, then teachers, and going from there. <br />
<br />
That had only been the first step in what would be world domination. <br />
<br />
Princess for her part, did enforce one rule, and she was only able to enforce it at all because she was the most powerful. &#39;Family was family.&#39; That was it. Nothing else. Bullying, stealing, destruction, weren&#39;t only expected, but ACCEPTED. <br />
<br />
At first glance she&#39;d have been mistaken for a human child in a costume, but only at first glance. A white two piece swim suit that hide absolutely nothing, (she was an imp, what need did she have those things? She wasn&#39;t a succubus after all). Fangs, eyes, claws, horns, digigrated feet that no human foot or stilt that could fit into, she was human in seeming only. She sat across her throne tapping a scepter that was obviously too large for her, but she handled it like it was nothing. <br />
<br />
She looked strolled over to a balcony overlooking her kingdom, the sky a sickening dirty pink. Below was total anarchy. Imps playing games such as lifting up boulders and smashing them on each other heads only to get up and do the same to others. Others doing &#39;extreme sports&#39; without safety gear, blatantly cheating as they knocked each other off the rails, smashing into the ground, only for the ground to break instead of their skulls. Imps who had wings, (or had wings for arms and/or legs), flew about the sky... providing &#39;droppings&#39; on imps who they were able to catch unaware. An imp with a giant red teddy rampaged through several imp black houses made of black stone, black wood, black rubber, black lego blocks, mud, anything. Being rebuilt into completely different shapes as the giant teddy bear past. <br />
<br />
A imp with six arms clawed down and plucked some candy from another imp&#39;s hand, the imp with horns shaped like the ears of a wolf responded by jumping up and grabbing her and engaging in a brutal fist fight. Other imps cheering at the fight, not caring who won.<br />
<br />
To call it anarchy was being far too kind. Princess thought of how the world was before, and decided this was all a decided improvement, in particular that all the icky boys were girls now. And that was fine by her. That had been her own personal touch. Yes, Princess had been at that age. Princess, or rather, the human who had been Princess hadn&#39;t been spoiled, but that in a way made her even more brutal once she could finally take whatever she wanted.<br />
<br />
An imp stood on the railing of her balcony. Wearing a bikini bottom and a white jacket with the sleeves torn off. She had mostly normal human feet besides her black claws. She had bright red skin and twisted yellow eyes and white hair like all her adopted sisters. Except... there was just a flat skin where her head should have been, not even a hole or a neck, just nothing. She was currently playing with her own head like it was a soccer ball. &quot;Hey Princess, wanna play?&quot; She asked. Not looking dizzy or in pain at all at kicking her own head over and over for the fun of it keeping it from touching the floor or going over the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now Jo&#39;lith.&quot; Princess said derisively. Jo&#39;lith, or rather, Joey, had been a brother to the human who would become Princess. <br />
<br />
&quot;If we managed, ER! WHEN we managed to open a major portal, can I lead the first army of imps through?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Princess agreed unthinkingly. For imps, there was no such thing as money, it was &#39;want, take, have.&#39; Simple as that. Promises... well, just be careful who you broke them TO. <br />
<br />
Princess stomped back inside, she came over to an imp surrounded by plush toys of snakes, spiders, vultures, slugs and sharks. <br />
<br />
<br />
The human that had been Boo&#39;Lith had been the school counselor, Princess had given her a fairy important spot in her &#39;court&#39; (if it could even be called that). She wore a white poncho, and her horns were like curves like arcs on either side of her head. she also had no eyes. Not that she had holes in her head, or anything like that, there was simply a blank space on her face where her eyes would have been. She at in the corner meekly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...the barrier is not finished Princess... we can still send imps through... they&#39;ll find the First Fur, they&#39;ll dispose of her... and with her gone... you&#39;ll be able to send in waves of imps... as long as the barrier isn&#39;t complete... &quot;<br />
<br />
Princess growled and kicked Boo&#39;Lith in the head. &quot;Keep searching! That&#39;s why you can see things others can&#39;t to begin with! It&#39;s why you were born this way!&quot; By born of course, Princess meant, when Boo&#39;lith was born rather than her former human self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Princess.&quot; Boo&#39;lith replied meekly. Boo&#39;lith for her part though, did like the idea of seeing the little baby furs squirm, and would like to add their plushie bodies to her collection.</p>
