<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AN: Unknown, S1, I'm loving both your contributions and I'm hoping you both continue to <br />
help move along the story. And I don't mind you guys replying to each other. It adds some <br />
excitement to things. <br />
<br />
Their duty concerning Big Bad Island complete, the Gargoyles simply returned to their <br />
normal spots. They separated without even saying words to each other, they had no need <br />
of them. The stone beasts merely stood atop their normal positions from which they had <br />
taken their names and resumed their motionless poses looking like mundane stone sans <br />
for how the moss and what no around the joints was not even with the rest of the 'statue.' <br />
<br />
Frontdoor did not even show reaction to seeing Omega-Whitney was once again herself <br />
instead of Jenny's shadow. Omega-Whitney was doing the duty assigned to her like a good <br />
Omega would and should, keeping an eye on both Zelipe and Amy as she had been <br />
instructed to by Prime-Omega-Martha. It didn't matter to her that she wanted to see her <br />
own children badly, wanting to let them know their mother was okay and she loved them, <br />
she had been given her duty to look after Gamma-Zack's pups and that was that. 'You <br />
could have been a good Gargoyle Whitney.' Frontdoor would have thought. <br />
<br />
Of course Frontdoor smelled the life in the fountain heads. He was a Gargoyle after all, but <br />
he knew Alpha Kaylee's love of art with spirits so he saw no reason to mention it to anyone. <br />
'Maybe she feels it gives her immortality always to be remembered art that remembers, or <br />
maybe she really does love art that has it's own point of view.' Frontdoor thought idly. <br />
<br />
Backdoor, was, of course, concerned for her step-brother Nicolas, she might have been <br />
stone but she wasn't heartless. 'I've been out of position for far too long, I've been away <br />
from my post for far too long... and if Nick is in the medical wing then I don't want to <br />
cause a ruckus and if he's gone... that's the way of all flesh I suppose...' If Backdoor was <br />
flesh herself she'd have shuddered. <br />
<br />
The stone in the shape of a wolf/dragon hybrid larger than the Lupmans knew her kind <br />
rarely grew attached those outside their own kind, after all, Gargoyles could live forever, <br />
everything else, couldn't.  Her father Library and her step-mother Molly were odd like that, <br />
even more surprising when her father had dared to think to break taboo and offer Molly <br />
immortality as a Gargoyle... while flattered... Molly had turned him down... apparently she <br />
wanted to be ultimately rejoined with her mate, and Library could never -ever- blame her <br />
for that! <br />
<br />
Backdoor had nearly thought of committing the act herself with Nick, she was his brother <br />
after all, there was more to family than stone, or blood as Man called it. But Nick had <br />
Nicole, not to mention Alexandra, Beatrice, and Isabelle. Backdoor wasn't about to deny -<br />
them- a family just to preserve some of her own, that would have been selfish. A part of <br />
her honestly felt like she had been robbed on that fateful day she had been a bride's maid <br />
(in particular Nicole's), on the day Nicolas formed his own sub-pack within the Big Bad <br />
Wolf family. <br />
<br />
And Backdoor had to admit, she had a great deal of respect for Nicole. On her wedding day <br />
(along with Beatrice, Alexandra and Isabelle), Backdoor (at the time with the name Lobby <br />
for where she had guarded the library and provided information when asked) had been <br />
fusing over Nicole who had been pressured by her mother (who unlike her child had a head <br />
of long hair while Nicole herself was 'baled') to wear a wig for the occasion. Lobby had tried <br />
to take Nicole's precious red ribbon off her ear and tie it onto the back of the black curly <br />
wig Nicole had reluctantly chosen to wear ... and Nicole, a mere Lupman... had managed to <br />
actually FORCE Lobby to LET GO of the little red ribbon around Nicole's head. Nicole had <br />
never turned around from the vanity mirror... she had simply reached back wordlessly and <br />
applied pressure on the stone claw as such that forcibly released the little strip of cloth.  'I <br />
don't know what the story is behind that ribbon, but it means a lot to Nicole... I don't think <br />
I've ever seen her without it... ' Even odder since Nicole was about the only Lupman <br />
Backdoor had remembered seeing who wore -anything-.  There seemed to be no bad <br />
blood about the incident though, since Nicole had Lobby with her when Nicole had burned <br />
the hated wig her mother made her wear... Nicole might have had to obey her mother <br />
before, but now she was a woman, she had control of her own destiny. <br />
<br />
The gargoyles watched as the Gold Deer began to trek away from the mansion, Jack and <br />
Marcine in back in another defiance that separated them from their empty headed cousins. <br />
But this was actually a tactical devision on their part. It was a matter of principle among <br />
Leomans and Lupmans the Prime Buck and the Prime Doe were never ever hunted. Jack <br />
and Marcine used this to their advantage so hunters would have to go -around- them to <br />
get at the rest of the Herd. After all, if the Prime Buck and Doe cared nothing for their <br />
Herd, how were they any different from any stupid beast? <br />
<br />
Library would learn of the battle Backdoor and the others had taken part in, proud to hear <br />
they had been the cavalry to effectively turn the tide of the entire battle, breaking the lines <br />
of the possessed Gold Deer and Living Gem Twin pups... Backdoor said if they had been a <br />
few minutes later there would have been twenty-four new living gem wolf twin pups <br />
dancing the dance of chaos in praise of Kurse's sick vision and who knows how many <br />
diverse shapes Kurse would have warped the Pride into in the name of her ideal world <br />
without laws or taboos. <br />
<br />
Molly would admonish both Backdoor and Nick and her daughter in laws for engaging in <br />
such a dangerous mission without tell her (who cares if it was the middle of the night when <br />
they did so?). But she would also be proud of them, and baby them for what felt like <br />
forever afterwards. <br />
<br />
And for the Gargoyles, duty would remain as it had always remained, and would guard the <br />
places they had been for however longer they remained in this world. <br />
<br />

&quot;'Nothing' you say?&quot; Penny asked about Kirk's time as a statue. <br />
<br />
&quot;The person who Transformed me, who I never even saw the face of, didn't exactly give me <br />
many options to DO anything while I was stone laying back in the same position for <br />
years... I remember you crying over me, I remember coming to visit me and talk to me at <br />
the gallery I was moved to with other members of the pride who have been turned into art <br />
over the years... but I couldn't DO anything about -anything- it might as well have been <br />
nothing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Penny thought about it, being a statue meant Kirk couldn't reply to another Transform or <br />
Dare to become a person again... no, he had always been a person, only the game had <br />
stripped him away his rights of one... It enraged Penny how the wolves in the old timeline <br />
had managed to break into the gallery wing set aside for confirmed victims of the game <br />
and do their business and leave magically assisted or not! 'It was supposed to be SAFE for <br />
him there dammit! That was the only reason I LET him be put in there in the first place!' <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Kirk, I failed you.&quot; 'And failed Kathy.' <br />
<br />
&quot;I failed you, you were hurt trying to save -me-.&quot; <br />
<br />
Penny looked at him, seeing the way he said that... Lionesses did the hunting, males <br />
protected the territory. It was just natural that way. And it was a reminder that Kathy's life <br />
as a human male was gone forever along with their previous gender roles. <br />
<br />
&quot;... you wouldn't say that if I was the male.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... you're not thinking of using that awful Game are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! Absolutely not!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Penny, you don't need to make yourself the male to protect me just because I failed to <br />
protect myself. It was my own mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Just how many judgements about ourselves are based on that one stupid little bit of DNA <br />
anyway?' Penny thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;This reality has as much right to exist as the previous one Penny-San,&quot; Amy said, &quot;to bring <br />
back the previous one would mean to end the existence of this one, and that would be <br />
unfair to those ... just as unfair to those who lost something or someone when reality <br />
began repairing itself. Destroying one happy innocent family to restore another happy <br />
innocent family is pointless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't suppose we could Transform or Dare reality to create separate timelines so <br />
everyone can have the lives and families of both?&quot; Kirk no longer understood what Penny <br />
and Amy were talking about. <br />
<br />
&quot;There can be only one timeline per universe... otherwise our choices become meaningless <br />
if it doesn't matter what we chose if all the doors are opened anyway. To decide is what <br />
defines free will. One idea is realized, the other fades, that is why it is called 'decide.' 'De-' <br />
for divide, and 'cide' for death... Gomennasai I've been spending too much time around <br />
Alice.&quot; <br />
<br />
Penny glared at her as she took Kirk around the waist. It was so new, but so familiar. Both <br />
alien, yet comforting.<br />
<br />
Amy bowed her head her paws together, &quot;What Jesen-Sama's chose to use the game for <br />
was selfish. And many families have been stolen from and torn apart as a side effect of -<br />
Sama's selfishness and foolishness ... but tearing apart the new families that have been <br />
born from this in the name of restoring the family that existed before would be just as <br />
destructive as it was for -Sama to tear apart those family to begin with... Not that it <br />
matters one way or not. With or without us, this world will keep turning. Weather we <br />
approve or not... reality will continue to heal itself.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Penny? What are you two going on about? What Jensen did? Old families? New families?&quot;  <br />
Kirk looked at his mate wondering if things had caused her to go funny in the head. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's... it's nothing Kirk, Penny and I are just discussing previous lives.&quot; Penny now that she <br />
written down Kirk's life as Kathy as dictated by him, she began to write her own life as <br />
Penn. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you didn't believe in past lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't.&quot; Penny gathered her courage. <br />
<br />
Amy cross her arms and narrowed her eyes but politely said nothing. <br />
<br />
Penny clenched her other paw in her lap, &quot;This life, is the only one you get, you don't get <br />
to play it over once it's done. And you don't get to pick and chose the details. You have to <br />
deal with... with the hand given you, don't demand a new hand... that's what my parents <br />
always taught me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Penny looked down at the book containing written in blood memories of things that no <br />
longer happened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you writing that in -blood- anyway? You should keep up your strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I'll explain it after we're Prime Mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay honey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny wondered if by writing this she was sealing her memories in stone. That she'd never <br />
be completely comfortable with Kirk, since a part of her that was still Penn would always <br />
be pinning for Kathy. 'But, it just doesn't feel -right- for everything we did as Penn and <br />
Kathy to just, never be. No one to even remember it.' <br />
<br />
Ami sat down still watching her brother and packmates as the cubs came around the <br />
corner, the cubs surprised to see Mary, along with four of the twins missing. While others <br />
around the estate were experiencing the price of jet lag, the quadruplets were as full of <br />
energy as if today was the day they were born. <br />
<br />
Amy began writing in her scroll again, again in her own blood, glade that Whitney couldn't <br />
see that detail from where she was being huggled by Amethyst on her return from zombie-<br />
land. <br />
<br />
Penny had to ask, &quot;What are you writing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The details of my wedding night as Randy with my wife Zelda.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kirk groaned, this past life business was too confusing and too disorienting for him, 'Better <br />
to just the past -stay- buried if you ask me.' Kirk thought. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
As Alice and Abbey had tea with the dictionaries, having now been joined by a pair of <br />
glasses with a funny nose and mustache who was discussing the proper way to speak <br />
improperly, Alice looked over a piece of paper she had drawn in her dreams. Contrary to <br />
popular belief, it was possible to read in your dreams, it was just a matter of it actually <br />
making sense. <br />
<br />
'If I would stay in the outside world long enough... without going within the world within <br />
the mirror.  Abbey and Smantha's ages could slowly catch up with me?'   Like the pups of <br />
the omegas, the glass pups knowing they weren't the same as their parents left feelings of <br />
discomfort... The half-sisters/cousins being more alike had been a small fantasy for the <br />
young children to appease her parents. <br />
<br />
Alice realized the power of the game could fix it all... and with her talent with words and <br />
with the witches' shades gone forever, there was no danger of it backfiring.  The twins <br />
could have the extra bits their parents had like the twins wanted, and Alice and her sisters <br />
could be identical like their mothers like glass pups wanted to. <br />
<br />
A sentient part of the curse had been phobic of the abuse of the game somehow gaining <br />
unwanted attention, this had been in fact only a paranoid echo of the three witches' <br />
impulsive behavior that made it all the easier for Maria Cruz to find them. <br />
<br />
Alice saw the twins fuse into Shivas like their parents were, Alice saw herself and her two <br />
younger half-sister/cousins perfectly the same in appearance, heart, and mind like their <br />
mothers none of them less a person because of it...  It would be so simply, so easy. So <br />
perfect. So happy. <br />
<br />
'But why does using the game to give myself, my sisters, and the gem twins what we all <br />
want feel to me somehow like cheating?' Alice wondered in her dreams. But deep down, <br />
Alice like Father Mike and Father Paul, in particular after the loss of the Omegas, and the <br />
deaths of Fox and Elise... felt the game had done enough. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
As Opal led Caroline Cobalt up the stairs to their room, he whispered, &quot;You know, we could <br />
use the game, separate you from Cobalt, she could your little sister, could have always <br />
been, and that'll be that. She won't have to vanish.&quot; <br />
<br />
Caroline thought of the sets of twins who no longer existed, Cobalt's friends, gone forever. <br />
She thought of the gem wolves who now existed only though the twins who were now the <br />
children of the shiva wolves in her new memories. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Cobalt loves you as much as I do... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could wait until she grows up and you could share.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cobalt/Caroline shook her head, &quot;In a way, I'm as much Caroline as she is. And I'm as much <br />
Cobalt as she is. When Kurse split us in two, we became unique. But we both had a crush <br />
on you, and you, the pair of twins you became... now they don't exist anymore. We still do. <br />
But we didn't want to die... it was scary... We both love you Opal, we both want you... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why can't you that separate? We're both Lupmans.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caroline and Cobalt both thought about it. &quot;Maybe deep down this is what both of us know <br />
we have to do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Maxine and Robyn meanwhile had taken one direct rout to the medical wing, to see Millie <br />
and give their adult identities a final farewell for a decade or so. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whao dere girl-friend this ain't wha' Ah all expected.&quot; Robyn said her accent coming <br />
through thicker when she was excited or intense. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, our packmates and our buddies bedding up I expected... two of the omegas Bart <br />
and Jenny turned into puppets surprising but acceptable... but whao... didn't expect Mother <br />
Glenn here...&quot;  Then Maxine grabbed hold of Robyn's hand as she pulled her inside, &quot;But it <br />
does provide a nice distraction for us to get inside and chat with Millie and not get drafted <br />
into medical duty, now let's get this show on before Millie and we forget.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya all see hur?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just look for the little heart on her butt.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
That all species of Man had the same number of chromosomes (the first major hurdle <br />
keeping any two species from breeding) was interesting enough: but due to Marie's <br />
appearance, it was a safe guess that the two sets of genes from the two separate species <br />
of mammals were not codominant when mixed together. <br />
<br />
 That it really mattered to Marie. She had a story to tell. <br />
<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity stayed the entire day with Trevor's family of gray and black lion people. <br />
They were polite, friendly, open, and eternally grateful for looking after and returning their <br />
cub to them. <br />
<br />
She looked through the family albums after asking Trevor where they had been kept... In <br />
them she saw human beings... That was when the lioness Marie, Trevor's mother, eyes the <br />
color of bright honey and gray and black fur like her son began to explain her family's <br />
history. And before Serenity's eyes, the pictures morphed into naked lion men and naked <br />
lion women as lioness Marie spoke of them.  Muscle growing, height increasing hair <br />
vanishing from the women's heads, and manes appear around the heads of the men. Golds <br />
and browns seemed to be on Jacob's side, Trevor's father. While on lioness Marie's side <br />
black and grays seemed to be dominant, though this was harder to tell in the earlier <br />
photos. <br />
<br />
&quot;And that was my great-great-great-uncle Ervin,&quot; Marie said without missing a beat as the <br />
overweight balding man in the photo wearing a stripped sweater became a only slightly <br />
round naked lion man with a black mane. &quot;He was excommunicated from The Pride when <br />
his Prime Mate found out he had mated with multiple females without her consent. She met <br />
another Leoman a couple years later who become her new Prime Mate Leo -no his parents <br />
didn't have much imagination- though one of her daughters from her litter with Uncle <br />
Ervin had a litter with Leo as well since she had yet to find her Prime Mate yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;YOU'RE JOKING!&quot; Madam Serenity exclaimed. <br />
<br />
Marie shrugged, &quot;Not everyone finds their Prime Mate at the same pace, I had nearly given <br />
up hope when I met Jacob-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no no, I mean, she really had -children- with her own step-father?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Marie blinked confused, &quot;It's not like they were related by blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity put on her poker face, &quot;Oh nothing, Trevor just never mentioned that <br />
before.&quot; 'Has every new species created by this damn game have nothing but sex on their <br />
minds-?!' <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity found herself thanking God that Marie chose NOT to press the issue, after <br />
all, this woman HAD brought home her son... Marie wasn't about to ask things of her that <br />
might upset this happy occasion. <br />
<br />
'Okay, this might be just delaying the inevitable as far as their ancestors go but,' &quot;So how <br />
long has your family lived here?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This has been one of the Pride's houses for decades, I've been living here personally since <br />
Jacob became my prime mate.&quot; Marie chose to leave out that she hoped nothing was wrong <br />
with her having had two litters of one in a row, but didn't want to bring that up. <br />
<br />
Now that Madam Serenity had a moment to think she thought, 'The wording of the <br />
transformation power of the pride said that only those who they loved and who loved them <br />
changed into lions when interacting with them. Yet this Uncle Ervin in spite of being <br />
unfaithful changed anyway... did he make up with his family eventually?' Madam Serenity <br />
however didn't want to ask more about family knowing it would just cause more relatives <br />
to mutate retroactively. <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity had of course volunteered to help with an early dinner. Being elderly and a <br />
guest did nothing to deter her.  Outside the kitchen window she saw Trevor playing with <br />
his now big sister by two years in the back yard apparently wrestling covering themselves <br />
with dirt and grass as they did so. Trevor acting like any other little boy. <br />
<br />
When they came in Marie licked Trevor clean, the cub moaned he was old enough to clean <br />
himself now, but his mother didn't seem to care at the moment, Sabrina 'Nala' managed to <br />
sneak past during the confrontation. After that, Trevor got on the phone and called some <br />
people in a row... apparently boys his own age (being too young to be interested in girls <br />
besides Mary who was Pride anyway so she didn't count).  Of course Madam Serenity heard <br />
how all but one of the phone calls had the voice on the other end turned from shouts of <br />
amazement into purrs and cub cries, the young voice on the other end saying how it was <br />
great to have their pack-mate back. <br />
<br />
'It's like a plague.' Madam Serenity thought, 'Love between friends?' What were the four <br />
types of love again? 'Love between couples, love between family, love for one's god, and <br />
love for one's friends. Or are there more? Or are there less?' If there was one thing Madam <br />
Serenity hadn't studied in her two lifetimes it was a deconstruction of and the opposing <br />
schools of thought on love. 'Maybe when the game is gone, the magic that's with the Pride <br />
and the Pack will vanish too...' She could HOPE it did... <br />
<br />
The kitchen would smell greatly of blood of course, but Madam Serenity endured it. She <br />
had been a police officer once after all, she had been to a very unpleasant homicide once... <br />
she shuddered as she thought how much the smells were the same. <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity was offered some utensils that were used for guests, and graciously <br />
accepted them. She didn't ask if he lions normally cooked their food or if it was for her <br />
benefit. However she knew she had to start collecting notes so she could hand them off to <br />
Gill, he'd be having trouble with this as well. But being a police chief, he'd be in a position <br />
where any mistakes he made would come off as much much worse. <br />
<br />
After dinner and more ice cream (it was milk after all), Madam Serenity had taken Trevor <br />
aside and looked in his eyes, an relatively innocent little boy looked back at her. 'Is he still <br />
bound to die some time before he turns twenty? All the other changes made by the game <br />
seem to have been internalized... ' Madam Serenity chose not to wonder about that, if those <br />
rules applied, it wasn't like anything could be change about that anyway. &quot;Trevor, tell me <br />
what happened on the day we met.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was still hiding from the man with red skin. I had helped this pink Felman from getting <br />
mugged by this big human who Dared her to sing all the songs from The Aristocat, he ran <br />
off. I talked with her for a bit. I went away without tellin' her my name, and I fell asleep on <br />
your door step  when looking for a place to hide for the night....&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity sensed no call sign, no performance, this was Trevor now, the Trevor who <br />
had now always existed, who had never even thought of highschool yet, who had never <br />
been a house cat, and had never been human. <br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor, who is Queen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... she's the weird tabby... the nice tabby who died when Mr. P thought she was a <br />
trespasser when helping -me- trying to see the Pack's pups...&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity saw his eyes misting up. &quot;It's okay dear, it wasn't your fault, remember <br />
that please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Madam Serenity.&quot; The little boy nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;There's a brave lad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like when I helped the mouse who was really a little boy escape all those rats?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Trevor, like that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity gave Trevor another hug, and bid Trevor's family farewell.  Though she <br />
WAS surprised when Marie asked if she was the same Madam Serenity who tried to help <br />
'Beta-Julie' try to find the parents of Anne's adopted pups. <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity adlibbed that she indeed way and made a note that she'd have to go see <br />
the wolf woman that Julie had become personally now. <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity left Trevor's house with his family.  'He has what he wanted, to be with his <br />
family again.. that's what's important right?' She thought to herself. <br />
<br />
She drove until she was at Glendale's Catholic church and stepped inside, finding it wasn't <br />
locked yet.  She found Judas lazying about on one the pews. <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity had no idea what the cat would say, but she had a fairly good idea that it <br />
understood what she was saying in spite of having a brain the size of a peach pit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take me to your owner.&quot; She said simply. <br />
<br />
The black cat Judas nodded and moved off the pew it was sitting on and began to skip <br />
along the isle. <br />
<br />
Judas led her to the pack of the church, and to the surprisingly large basement underneath <br />
it that Father Mike kept various things from his predecessors. Judas left between her legs <br />
back upstairs. <br />
<br />
She found Father Mike working at what looked like a cruder version of her own Alchemy <br />
lab using his monkey tail to handle this and that. That was when Father Paul dropped in <br />
from behind her.... the orangutan was in bandages... <br />
<br />
He hand sighed, 'Hello, welcome, what are you doing here right now?' <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity said, &quot;While the shadow of the witches are gone, it seems that the side <br />
effects of the game having been used so much so fast has left realty warping by itself <br />
almost it seems, I've decided to help you prepare as much as the cure is needed to spread <br />
it through Glendale's pipe system to have it then blessed and dissolve the game in one <br />
swoop... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Madam Serenity,&quot; Father Mike said turning around, &quot;Maybe it's due to the <br />
wording of our own curses, or being exposed to the cure almost constantly, or maybe it <br />
has to do with that cat of mine. But I DID notice people coming in to service today naked <br />
and half animals like Anne was Sunday and some lion people like Paul told me the police <br />
became...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whose to say how long you being able to notice that will last.&quot; Serenity said, &quot;And that's <br />
the reason why I want to pitch in, I left Trevor with his family and he couldn't be happier to <br />
be with them again... I was scared at what I'd do with myself once the game was gone, but <br />
I'm seeing too much of existence changing tra-la-la to just stand by. The cure might not <br />
undo the changes or even stop them, but if it finishes off the game itself... then the sooner <br />
the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome aboard.&quot; Father Mike said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; Madam Serenity said, &quot;Let me show you some tricks with doing Alchemy I've picked <br />
over the years .... &quot;</p>
