<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...Chicken Legs. Madame Illusia  held her chin in thought. Odd. Getting two leg changes hasn&#39;t happened before. But then again, she forgot to give the wheel any direction. Let&#39;s see what happens, Madame thought.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Tyler was crying like a girl inside. This was beyond just getting animal parts. He&#39;s not sure what he should be classified as any more. On the outside he&#39;s probably being seen as some kind of circus animal waiting for it&#39;s next order. On the inside however, he feels like... he doesn&#39;t even know what he is any more. He is like a freakish combination of everything. <br />
<br />
From what he can he can tell, he has horse legs is twice as big as normal. it could even be considered as yak legs just by how thick they are. But that&#39;s the only thing that can be considered as normal. The waist up is completely freak. First off, as a result of humping the sluttish girl from behind, his dick is gone. well, kind of. He never had a Virginia before, so he doesn&#39;t know what it should feel like, but Judging From the Knot like pressure down there, he&#39;s guessing he has a weird mixture between manhood and womanhood. A wolf&#39;s Virginia with a wolf&#39;s dick instead of a clit, plus that damn quartet of bull testicles still hanging below his dickgina. As a result of that black sack, his wolf cock is sticking rock solid out of his slit the entire time he been merged. In fact, he just recovered from blacking out with pleasure because that damn girl fell on top of it. When he came to, he realized he now have an elephant truck that&#39;s moving without him because of Madam&#39;s magic. To make matters worse, he can feel the entirety of Lilly&#39;s body despite not having control of it. That includes that heavy, bloated, 10 gallon pressured udder she&#39;s supporting over her chest and below her boobs. He also hates  the bitch that&#39;s merged with him because she is acting very slut like and calm. It&#39;s like this happens to her all the time and she accepts it. Come to think of it, that witch mentioned that Lilly came from her &quot;farm&quot;. Just what kind of farm dose Madame have. <br />
<br />
But right now, Tyler is still coming into gripes of being a animal for the rest of life, being mind numbingly horny all his his life AND being a FUKING GIRL for the rest of his life. That&#39;s when the changes finally started. <br />
<br />
Below the horse fur, yellow scales started growing on his skin. Huge chunks of fur started falling off, but a lot of the fur in between the scales stayed, giving his legs a weird furry scaly checker bored like look. Suddenly, Tyler could actually FEEL his inverted knees. Does this mean he can actually bend them now? Well he can&#39;t find out until Madame releases her magic on him. Just then, Tyler could feel an extreme burning sensation in his hooved feet as they split apart into four toes, one pointing back. In other words, his feet became chicken feet with hooves instead of claws. This feels MUCH better bigger feet but still feels slippery with hooved toes. But he won&#39;t know how balanced he is until  Madame illusia let him go. <br />
<br />
Madame stared curiously at Tyler&#39;s new legs. Interesting. Now for some entertainment. &quot;Well Tyler,It seems you came a long way since a half-hour ago.&quot; Madam said loudly. &#39; Half-hour! That felt like it took months!&#39; Tyler thought. &quot;So how bout I show you how far you came.&quot; Madame announced. &quot;Stephan! Roll in a mirror for me.&quot; &quot;Yes Madame&quot;, Stefan said as he appeared out of nowhere with a big mirror with wheel.<br />
<br />
As Stephan was rolling the mirror over, he was deep in thought. Despite the wisecracks about being in a farm or calling her Taylor, Madame really does respect Lilly. At least, she used to. About two years ago, Lilly was a volunteer just like anyone else, but instead of resisting her changes or embracing it like an slut, she was genuinely exited about it, always asking Madame to change her more so she can explore different body parts. She was defiantly the lively and curious type. Apparently, she has been dreaming of having mismatched body part like an chimera ever since she was a kid. Lilly once told Stephan that she always wondered what it was like to have a crocodile&#39;s jaw and it&#39;s cool that she finally got one. So instead of just sending her out into the world change forever, just like any other wheel of change victim, Madame offered to make Lilly her assistant. Ever since then, she has been testing out new spells for Madame and testing out different genitals Madame&#39;s &quot;volunteers&quot;. She even claimed she will be a better assistant to Madame then Stephan. But until the, she was Stephan&#39;s partner in assisting Madame and was even his girlfriend. Many even more, However, a couple of months ago,Lilly started getting addicted to transformations and sex and started to act more whore like. baby even a little animal like. Because of this, Madame has been treating her more and more animal like. Madame has assured Stefan that she hasn&#39;t used any magic to affect her mind. However, Stefan has the sinking feeling that Madame simply got tired of Lilly&#39;s positive attitude, so she used her magic to slowly get rid of her. This time it looks like Madame is playing this for keeps. After the show is over, Lilly will be gone as part of that jock forever. And it doesn&#39;t looks like Lilly is even self aware anymore. Stefan would do any thing to save, but he can&#39;t risk to be transformed by Madame himself. He may be Madame&#39;s flesh and blood, but he doubt even he is protected from his grandmother&#39;s life change transformation magic. With that sad thought Stefan glances up at his former lover as her rolls up the mirror.<br />
<br />
As the mirror rolled up in front of him, Tyler couldn&#39;t believe the monster reflection in front of him. Sensing what you are and seeing what you are is two completely different things. Tyler knew what he was but actually looking at himself made him relies he&#39;s really going to be this freakish animal for the rest of his life. In hind sight, he looks like some kind of big satyr with chicken feet, but he doesn&#39;t remember a satyr having a female tarsal bent over if front of the male one, nor the hyena toughs, elephant trunks, red dicks that might as well be a donkey&#39;s dong, or that DAMN UDDER! If it wasn&#39;t for his bovine testicles pumping him full of male hormones it would be  that bloated bitch and her udder  pumping him full of FEMALE hormones. Tyler is no longer panicking, now he is just EXTREMELY irritated by the absurdity of this situation. PLEASE just let him FUCK. Ever since Tyler lost concince, Madame has been in complete control of his body, making him act like a real circus animal. Tyler bet that just humping the air with a dick already in his Virginia will make him ogasim both ways. Man, Woman, Animal, he doesn&#39;t care, just let him move so he can ogasm the worries away.<br />
<br />
While Tyler was marveling his new form Madame pondered this new development. So the two leg changes mixed? Ever since she created the wheel of change she always used her magic to choose where the wheel falls. Technically, the wheel can also fall on inseminated objects and can randomly transform a part anywhere on the body. for example, someone&#39;s head can be transformed into a liter donkey cock, and apparently, it can combine parts, hence chicken-horse legs. Madame never relised this because she always controlled the wheel. she didn&#39;t need to, she just like cheating , controlling and transforming with her magic. maybe should make a habit of playing fair... nah. Either way she is curios how this will turn out. So for the first time in years she turned the wheel of change without controlling it with magic. &#39;I wonder what will happen to Tyler and my former assistant Lilly&#39;.  The Madame Illusia wondered.</p>
