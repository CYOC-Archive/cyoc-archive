<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Then let&#39;s make them little gothic horror babies!&quot; said the Ringmaster. <br />
Everyone exclaimed in surprise and anticipation. They did not expect that and were impatient to see the results. Also, much more pragmatically, the Ringmaster could use those two in his circus. A few of his current performers would be elated as well. They wanted babies of their own and their circumstances were not favourable at all due to obvious reasons. But on with the show. Two puffs of black smoke later, later Jared had become a werewolf pup with grey and white fur, panting and wagging his tail in excitement. As for Tayla, she was now a little vampire girl, dressed in a flouncy petticoat of the same color as before and a simple long-sleeved top. She had ballerina flats on her feet and looked silently but with interest around her. <br />
&quot;Our werewolf boy lord and our little vampire lady, ladies and gentlemen!&quot; he said amidst much enthusiastic clapping.<br />
The Ringmaster took a rubber ball and bounced it. This brought him the immediate attention of the werewolf pup. He caught it and retrieved the bright red bouncing ball, earning him dog treats. He then stood on his hind legs, natural as can be, and bowed to the laughing and clapping audience. The Ringmaster turned to Tayla, who had looked at all this in complete silence. He retrieved from his coat a bright red lollipop. Tayla&#39;s eyes shone immediately.<br />
&quot;Care to give us a dance for a blood lollipop, my dear?&quot; sweetly asked the Ringmaster.<br />
Tayla nodded, licking her lips and letting her fangs show for the briefest moments. The crowd gasped. So realistic! So deliciously twisted! On cue, to the sound of harpsichords, Tayla started a sophisticated dance, not quite ballet but graceful and even a little sinister. Then the Ringmaster had her waltz with a porcelain doll that appeared in her arms. A sweet delicate monster, she was. Then the Ringmaster made a decor of a haunted castle appear, painted upon a gigantic canvas, and Jared found himself with an adorable bowtie at his neck. The perfect gentleman, he bowed to the little vampire lady and danced with her in a perfect waltz and upper-class dances of the 18th and 19th centuries. Everyone in the audience applauded and thought it adorable and so enchantingly gothic. Old-fashioned yet extremely tasteful. The Ringmaster glowed with pride. He loved outdoing himself. And after his due reward of seeing his work appraised and given due admiration,    he made everything vanish in a great puff of black smoke with silver sparkles within it. Jared and Tayla appeared back and waved and saluted enthusiastically, beaming. Of course, these were simple magical replicas, which would vanish in less than a week. Enough for these clones to be seen around and leave the circus without suspicions, along with its actors, performers and supposed animatronics and elaborate costumes.<br />
<br />
As for Jared and Tayla, they were backstage, sitting on a bench, under deep hypnosis. Still respectively a werewolf and a vampire, still eight, they were tired, so very tired. Performing was so fun but quite demanding on their bodies. Now they were waiting for their parents to arrive and gather them in their loving arms. When the show was over, the Ringmaster waved a few times. A lot had to be altered but it was not beyond his competences, far from it. The male homosexual couple of the circus would be thrilled. As would the lesbian couple that were werewolves too. They had both been wanting children for so long! Now they had one each handed to them on a platter. He got a colleague to warn them and new rooms to their trailers were added, with everything children might need, along with things that would indicate their lives and memories were there. As if they had both lived there since their birth. If the happy new parents wanted a new name for their little one, it was at their discretion. New memories, if a bit hazy at first, were implemented into the minds of the two new recruits to the circus. They would solidify themselves with time and as new ones, real ones, were added from now on. The Ringmaster then saw the prospective parents arrive. Right on cue. A bit apprehensive but that was normal. As soon as they saw them, the two children responded accordingly. The Ringmaster glowed with pride. Yes, he was that good.<br />
<br />
The werewolf women, in human form for the moment, were greeted with a grey furry shooting star that collided with them, shouting &#39;Mommy! Mama! Mommy!&#39; with absolute love in his eyes. They hugged him back and called him Jared. They went back to their trailer, congratulating him on his performance and how much he had deserved new squeaky toys and his favorite dog cookies. As for Tayla, she hugged one man at the waist. The other called her Melodie. The other shot him a furious glance, indicating that this was not the name he had wanted but the deed was done. The Ringmaster almost laughed. Agnan would get used to it eventually and both still loved each other deeply. They merely had their arguments, like any couple did. Agape picked up Melodie, formerly Tayla, and promised a nice meal of fine blood for the superb performance she had offered her audience. She would even have the right to taste a bit of spiced wine mingled with it. Just a few drops. She smiled, content. She would get a nice bath afterwards and sleep in her comfortable room, while her two fathers would rest in coffins in the little living-room. The sun was not deadly to vampires, but the midday sun was very, very uncomfortable. The setting sun was incredibly more bearable. The vampires and werewolves performed at times only but their shows were always very successful. The Ringmaster really felt his day had not been wasted at all. Two new recruits and two happy couples. He sighed, happy. He really lived for those moments, seeing people with new, better and more fruitful lives. Seeing smiles on the faces of his colleagues. Yes, he lived for those moments when things fitted into place and content couples and families were created. That never helped integration into a new life more, his experience had taught him.</p>
