<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh felt his body continuing to change. He was helpless against whatever was causing it.<br />
<br />
The man tied Josh to the coral and laughed at him. &quot;I'll be back with someone that will make you feel better.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the man left, Josh pulled at the rope in an attempt to loosen himself. He didn't have any luck. Starting to feel trapped, Josh felt the urge to escape rise from within him. He brayed loudly as new instincts flooded his mind.<br />
<br />
Doing his best to calm down, Josh tried thinking peaceful thoughts. He closed his eyes and imagined a serene field. It was full of tasty grass whose scent excited Josh.<br />
<br />
Wait a second, Josh thought as he opened his eyes, tasty grass? That wasn't right! He didn't eat grass! Horses ate grass, so did donkeys. However, he wasn't a donkey.<br />
<br />
Josh felt his tail swishing back and forth. He tried to stand up only for his center of gravity to force him back onto four legs. Now four legs *was* standing up!<br />
<br />
No, Josh thought, he couldn't be a donkey for real! Things like this didn't happen to people like him. He was smarter then this!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Josh didn't yet realize the magnitude of his situation.  He had four hooves in place of feet and hands. Any thought of communication was shot to hell by his new tongue and vocal chords. He tried to speak, but all he could manage were brays.<br />
<br />
Shit, Josh thought, was we he going to do? He had to get out of there, that much was clear! Then he realized that, even if he did escape,  he had no idea where he would go. If he managed to get home, his family would see a donkey and not their son!<br />
<br />
Josh again closed his eyes. He pictured the same field again. The grass looked tasty to him. He tried to push the desire to eat it out of his mind but it persisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having fun?&quot; a voice asked, it was the man from before.<br />
<br />
Opening his eyes, Josh turned his head to see the man escorting a horse. Josh brayed at the man in a desperate attempt to beg for his humanity. It didn't work.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will make you feel better,&quot; the man said.<br />
<br />
Walking the horse up to Josh's right side, the man untied Josh before taking several steps backwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead, what are you waiting for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh looked at the horse, he sniffed her. Her scent was pleasant. Shaking his head, Josh tried to ascertain what he was considering. This was a horse, he wasn't compatible with her! He most definitely wasn't attracted to her! Josh didn't need long to realize that, yes, he *was* compatible with her! With horror, Josh realized that not only had the man told him that they bred mules here but that in his current form, Josh was in position to do just that!<br />
<br />
Braying in protest, Josh shook his head. No, he wasn't going to surrender. They could do this to his body but he was not a jackass inside!<br />
<br />
The horse nuzzled against Josh. He watched her swish her tail back and forth. The man was still standing behind Josh and the horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you're thinking. You think you're better then this, that you're still human inside! Give it up, you're a jackass now. Human inhibition means nothing to you,&quot; the man said. He walked right up to Josh and looked into Josh's long face. &quot;You only have one rule now; be a jackass. Even if you fight it and escape, where will you go? I think your mate wants something from you. Would you let down such a sweet thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man took several steps back. Josh looked back at the horse. Taking a risk, he inhaled her scent as deep as he could. It was a decision he would come to regret. Something about her scent awakened a need from within him. Josh felt his donkey hood grow. Instinct and desire flooded his mind. Inhibition vanished from inside of him as though the mare's scent had plucked it away. All that mattered to Josh now was what was between his legs.<br />
<br />
Josh maneuvered so he was behind the mare. She moved her tail aside as an invitation. Her scent filled his nostrils which only furthered the desire within him. He knew he was becoming the stereotype but he didn't care. All that mattered was satisfying that desire. The outside world was but a blur as Josh mounted the mare, realizing that ironically, he was getting the horse ride he had been interested in although not in the way he'd meant.<br />
<br />
Acting on pure instinct, Josh used pleasure to fuel him. Uninhibited desire unlike anything Josh ever experienced drilled his body and mind. If letting go of his humanity felt this good, Josh wasn't sure he wanted to return. His thoughts driven by lust, Josh preformed his act as naturally as though he done it a thousand times before. Yes, this was what he wanted out of life he realized, this was what mattered, nothing else! Josh brayed and put everything into this as though it were the sole reason for his existence. As far as his hormone crazed mind was concerned, it was.<br />
<br />
However, as the saying goes about all good things, Josh soon felt his body building for the climax. If the act was the performance then this climax would have brought the house down. This was beyond anything Josh imagined were possible. Maybe the magic of the island made it better then a natural donkey could ever have in an attempt to lure Josh. He didn't care, then and there, it felt incredible and that was all that concerned him.<br />
<br />
It was over and Josh dismounted. The hormones calmed and released his mind. Josh realized in horror what he had done.  <br />
<br />
The true scope of his situation hit home. He had to get out of there before these instincts not only made him do that again but forced his human intelligence out in exchange for desire. If that happened, Josh knew that it wouldn't matter that he was born human.<br />
<br />
Despite the disgust over the knowledge of what he'd done, Josh had to admit that it had felt good, damn good in fact. Perhaps just on more go wouldn't hurt, Josh thought. After all, he'd already done it once. That mare did smell nice. Was letting go only one more time so bad?<br />
<br />
No, Josh thought with a shake of his head, this wasn't who he was. But, if he wasn't going to give in, Josh wondered what his next step was to be.</p>
