<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You are now SUZY, and you are concerned with your friend. You come to her house expecting to hang out, but hear her crying in her room. <br />
&quot;Jennifer, are you okay?&quot; You ask. The girl in question turns around with a shock, tears in her eyes.<br />
&quot;Suzy? What are you doing here?! You need to get out!&quot; She shouted. You are quite alarmed at her state, you must say.<br />
&quot;We planned to go to school together, remember? Besides, you look like you need a hug.&quot; You walk up to your friend and give her a big bear hug. Your friend, you notice, is a lot squishier than you remember. She also smells...really really good!<br />
&quot;Damn, what is that smell? A new perfume? It smells great!&quot; You respond. Jennifer looks at you in horror, much to your alarm. <br />
&quot;Oh no, it&#39;s already too late!&quot; She shouted. <br />
&quot;What&#39;s already to late? BURP&quot; You cover your mouth, not expecting that sudden bout of gas. Now that you notice, your stomach is giving some pretty heavy signs that this wasn&#39;t going to be a one time incident. <br />
&quot;Whelp, excuse me! Heh! Sorry, I&#39;m apparently super gassy right now. Jeez, I don&#39;t remember eating anything to cause this...ah well, should pass come time for school. You coming? You need to get dressed.&quot; You state. She just continues to stare at you in horror.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; *Pbbbft* You immediately blush from your sudden gas attack from down below, the gurgling in your stomach becoming more and more prominent. <br />
&quot;Holy shit, I&#39;m sorry Jen. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten into me. I guess I&#39;m gassier than I thought. You...probably don&#39;t want to ride with me then, given your hatred of farts?&quot; She still just stares at you in frozen horror, and it&#39;s really starting to worry you.<br />
&quot;Hey Jen, earth to Jen! You there?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Suzy. This is all my fault.&quot;<br />
&quot;Um, what is? What are you talking about? What&#39;s going on? You&#39;re scaring me, Jen-BUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!&quot;<br />
You look in utter surprise as you cover your mouth with both hands. They slowly travel down to your stomach as you feel the pressure and pain shifting in uncomfortable ways. Without much warning, you find yourself pushing out a long, raunchy fart with little relief coming from it.<br />
&quot;Okay, um...I&#39;m just going to go now. I&#39;ll, uh...I&#39;ll see you at school.&quot; You say, trying to get out of the humiliating situation as fast as you can. You think you hear her shout &quot;No, Suzy, don&#39;t go!&quot; But you&#39;re out the door before you even respond. You immediately let out another butt blaster in an attempt at getting relief, but none coming.<br />
&quot;God, how am I so gass-URRRRRP- fuck, what is wrong with me?!&quot; You ask yourself as you grip your bloated belly. With a moment of thought, you would have realized that your belly was actually much fatter, along with the rest of your body as it slowly expands. However, this doesn&#39;t cross your mind until much later when it&#39;s too late. You get into your car and start it up, hoping that you didn&#39;t seem too rude to Jennifer. However, you did kind of fill her room with your massive farts, so you think you made the right choice in leaving her. You buckle your seat belt with some trouble, trying to get over your ridiculously bloated belly, so much so that your shirt is starting to ride up over it. It&#39;s round and taunt with gas. Once again, you push another series of farts out, watch seemingly larger than the last, to try and get some relief. It doesn&#39;t, in fact it seems to only make it worse. You growl in frustration, your car now filled with the stench of your ass. You open a window in hopes of getting fresh air, however you find it is difficult to get rid of all the gas you put in it. You try and hold your gas, but not even that succeeds as the pressure builds and eventually you find yourself releasing far more massive farts with the build up. After a few minutes, you find yourself in a constant battle of trying to simultaneously release farts, hold farts, yet have the farts control you as you only get more and more uncomfortable. You don&#39;t notice, but your body is now in the 300&#39;s, your belly pushing against the wheel, and your ass pushing you further up in the seat. You do notice how uncomfortably tight your baggy sweat pants and t-shirt are, however, but pay it no mind compared to your gas attacks. You decide to ignore the smell (as horrendous as it is), and just concentrate on getting rid of the persistent pressure in your body. You push as hard as you can out your ass, fart after loud fart streaming out almost endlessly while simultaneously expanding your body. You are stupefied by the amount of gas you have. How could it even be physically possible to be this gassy? You once again find yourself with both no release, and an even worse smelling car. It&#39;s about then that your legs explode from your pants, finally too big to be contained. You look down in confusion, only after your legs were free did you realize just how tight your pants were. You are met with an enormous, wobbling belly and a pair of enormous breasts barely being contained by your t-shirt. At first, the image is too bizarre for you to process, but after a few minutes of staring, then touching your massive belly, you freeze up with horror. How did this happen? This can&#39;t be real! You pull over onto the side of the road, and grip your new belly, shaking it around. There&#39;s no doubt it&#39;s yours, as you can feel it, as well as the shaking causing you gas spasms more uncontrollable than usual. You see your belly actually expand every time you fart. You look in horror at just how massive you are now, as well as practically naked. You sit there, farting away, watching as your body expands while also exploring your new monstrous form. So much fat everywhere! You can barely move without bumping fat into more fat, jiggling away as you shake it around. You don&#39;t think you&#39;ve ever seen anyone as fat as you are becoming as you start to fill in all the gaps in the front seat, forcing you to try and adjust you seat position with little success. Finally, after what felt like hours, your gas actually dies down with a final sputter and you stop growing. Now, you have seen some fat girls. Hell, you mock a lot of them. But now, you make them all seem like super models in comparison. You can&#39;t believe how fat you are. You have literally no room to move because of how much space all your fat takes up, making you stuck. You try and jiggle around with massive ripples moving throughout your body, but you only end up slightly freeing your arms. This car was clearly never made for someone this fat. Finally, you manage to get the car door open, and you practically pour out flat on your massive belly. You find yourself moving with ease, as if you don&#39;t have a quarter ton of fat on you. Standing up, you send your body into another spasm of jiggles and wobbles. Even standing still, it takes a full minute for them to settle down only for them to act up again when you move the tiniest bit. You casually walk forward, feeling your body come to life around you. Then, you start running, your body going crazy as well as making the ground shake. You stop with some difficulty, causing a rather loud wallop as your boobs smash you in the face. Other than that, this actually felt really cool, weirdly enough. It was like how you normally move, but with much more power behind each stride.  Regardless, you look fatter than someone on &quot;My 600 lbs. Life.&quot; Actually, you figure you MUST be 600 lbs. at least, you&#39;re just SO HUGE! You&#39;re not sure what to do, with how you&#39;re body is. In fact, you&#39;re still not sure what&#39;s going on. That&#39;s about when you feel your gas act up again. You grip your massive stomach and release a loud, long moan that ends up putting your body into another wave of jiggles. The pressure and pain only increases, however, so you just try and concentrate on relieving yourself. However, you find each fart to get shorter and wetter, until you start to feel something else come along. You panic. You&#39;re nowhere near a restroom, and you feel like you won&#39;t be able to hold on much longer. You find out that you can&#39;t hold on at all, however, when a smelly log makes its way into your too small panties. You freeze in horror. You can&#39;t control it at all. Your body further alienates you as it pushes out another log, then another, then another, causing your too small panties to droop pitifully. You finish it off as you feel your bladder fail and release a flood onto the ground. You realize you are now completely incontinent. Tears stab your eyes as you continue and fail to understand what is going on, only made worse when your gas comes back in full force. You try and hold it, but you find any control you had over your bowels is gone as the sputtering mess comes out your ass. You feel filthy. You feel helpless. You feel humiliated. You feel a lot of emotions, and they can&#39;t very well all express themselves clearly, so you just begin to sob. People passing by on the street see a half naked, beautiful girl sobbing on the ground, some opening their windows to whistle or catcall. You look up in confusion. People aren&#39;t disgusted? You get up and look at the mirror on your car, seeing yourself before all this mess happened, except ten times better looking. Is this what you look like to others? You don&#39;t dismiss the idea. The fact that you turned into...whatever you are, certainly opens you up to crazy ideas. Deciding that lying down and sobbing was getting you nowhere, you try to clean yourself up. You remove the poop in your panties, and then use napkins in your car to try and clean your body up. Somewhat satisfied, you take a large towel in your trunk and use it to make a make shift skirt (though it barely fit). You enter your car again (fixing the seating before, of course) and start the car. What should you do?</p>
