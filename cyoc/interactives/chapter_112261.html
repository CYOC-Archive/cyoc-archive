<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan had never had a glamorous life, that was not until recently. His family had moved to L.A. from Quebec when he was a child, so he had always been made fun of for his accent or something equally stupid. When he was in high school he started to turn his life around. He started his own business, started working out and now at the age of 21 he lives in a sizable apartment in down town L.A.<br />
<br />
He had recently patented a new skin lotion line titled: desirable. As far as he knew it was just a regular skin lotion brand, maybe with a special scent but not much else. <br />
<br />
One Saturday morning the delivery man dropped off a box of the new line at his apartment building. Dan collected said box from downstairs and carried it back to his room. He sat on his bed with a craft knife and cut the box open. He had been told to send his thought on the lotiolotion back to his designers within the week. <br />
<br />
Taking out one of the blue and orange bottles he looked it over in his hands and read the label. &quot;Men&#39;s skin lotion&quot; and then in what he assumed was French it read Douche for shower and then then desirable. <br />
<br />
He nodded to himsehimself, noting his approval. He placed that bottle on his dresser as well as the other mens bottles. And put the rest of the bottles in his bathroom. He had a maid coming that day so he was sure she would assort them. <br />
<br />
He returned to his dresser and tried some of the lotion, he rubber a little in his hands and behind his ears. He was meant to do it in the shower but didn&#39;t care all to much.<br />
<br />
He opened up his laptop and began doing some work on emails and stuff. <br />
<br />
His hands started to feel a little irritated and so he used a little hand lotion from a smaller bottle on his dresser. His hands started to feel a little better. <br />
<br />
At ten o&#39;clock he heard a knock on his door. He opened it to see a twenty something Spanish lady standing holding a box of cleaning supplies, a mop and a duster. She was wearing a simple grey T shirt and blue sweatpants, with her hair tied in a pony tail behind her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; she started &quot; I&#39;m Destiny,&quot; she followed in a sultry voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes I spoke to you on the phone,&quot; Dan answered. They spoke for a minute discussing how much she would be paid and such. Her English wasn&#39;t the best but Dan spoke a little Spanish so communicating wasn&#39;t too hard. Dan then took his laptop from his desk and went into his office room as she began cleaning. He was thankful for wearing quite a tight pair of pants as she likely would have seen his throbbing erection. Usually he was able to control himself in situations like that but he couldn&#39;t control himself around such a buxomme latina as her, what with her large breasts and hips amd sultry voice. He was actually ashamed of himself but thought not of it as he adjusted his glasses and continued on working.<br />
<br />
Destiny put her things to the side and began to clean the kitchen, she was just happy to be getting paid so much. Dan turned out to be a rather generous employer but his house was fairly messy. She wiped down his countertops and put his dirty dishes away before moving on to his bathroom.<br />
His bathroom was cleaner, but still quite messy. She eyed a large box over as she was surveying the landscape of the blue and white tile bathroom. Curious as she was she opened the box to have a look. She pulled out one of the blue and orange bottles and read the label.<br />
Her English reading wasn&#39;t the best but she could make out what the labels on the bottles read. She shrugged nonchalantly and flipped the cap open. She poured out a little onto her hands and rubber it over her arms. <br />
<br />
She continued cleaning for a moment but couldn&#39;t shake how good the lotion was making her tanned arms feel. She took her blue rubber gloves off and laid them over the side of the countertop. She took the bottle and place it next to the gloves, she made sure the door was locked; it was. And stripped off to her underwear. She felt a little selfish as she coated her entire body with the stuff, but then again, why would he need it. She spent a good five minutes coating herself before she continued cleaning. <br />
<br />
She felt waves of ecstasy was over her every now and then whenever she would brush her breasts by accident when wiping a mirror or something. But continued to clean regardless. At this point she just wanted to get paid and leave; she was so embarrassed. <br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t contain herself anymore, she was so horny. She sat there against the door and began to masturbate.<br />
<br />
Dan had just left his office to get a drink from the fridge when he heard moaning coming from his bathroom. He listened for a minute and knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey are you alright in their?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
Destiny jumped and put her clothes back on quickly. &quot;Oh, yes I&#39;m ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, are you done in their? You&#39;ve been in their for a while. I only hired you for an hour, I mean I&#39;ll pay more if you want but...&quot; he continued as Destiny hurried to wipe the bathroom wall down. She accidentally turned the shower on as she was stood in their and got herself quite wet.<br />
<br />
She opened the door to see Dan still waiting there.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m, sorry,&quot; she started. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to take so long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it&#39;s fine...&quot; he said as he caught glimpse of her shirt. It was all wet down her front. &quot;Do you want another shirt?&quot; He asked as she began to walk off. She turned around and nodded as if she had been defeated. <br />
<br />
He went into his bedroom and opened his closet, he picked out a tank top that was to small for him. And gave it to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you go down the hall there&#39;s a...&quot; he began to say but she just took her shirt off there and then in front of him. She went to put the shirt on but caught glimpse of his throbbing erection through his pants. She audibly gasped and covered her mouth with her hands.<br />
<br />
She just stared up at him with a shocked expression. He looked flustered and began to apologize, but she just placed her finger on his mouth to silence him and sat him down on the bed. <br />
