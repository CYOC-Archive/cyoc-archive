<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As night fell on the Camp, the summer heat cooled off to something a bit more pleasant. Zack only stopping by his cabin for a moment to let Tom fix his hair. The wolf was obsessive about grooming, and it was somewhat endearing. Zack took off the scarf and undid a few buttons on his shirt, motioning for Tom to follow him once the wolf was satisfied. They went to the next cabin over, and Zack gave a polite knock which was soon responded to by Cameron&#39;s shout of, &quot;Come in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cameron and Patrick sat in chairs at the cabin&#39;s sole table, already chatting away. Zack took up another empty chair with Tom taking the last. &quot;Tom, have you met these two? Cameron is my teammate and friend from college, this is Patrick, we just met but if Cameron likes him he must not be terrible. Guys, this is Tom, don&#39;t let the uptight look fool you, he&#39;s harmless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom gave Zach&#39;s shoulder a little shove. &quot;Nice to meet you guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cameron was out of his chair in a flash and digging under his bed. &quot;Got a surprise for you guys.&quot; He pulled out a cooler, which when he opened misted a little into the air. The ice packs were holding up surprisingly well, and he pulled out a few cans of beer, passing them around.<br />
<br />
Patrick and Tom both looked at the cans in their hands dubiously, until Zack popped his open. &quot;It&#39;s not enough to get drunk, just unwind a little. It was a hard day, we deserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you even get this on campgrounds?&quot; Patrick asked a little stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help from the basketball team.&quot; Is all Cameron admitted to with a laugh. &quot;They have their own stash.&quot; Soon, all four were drinking.<br />
<br />
Patrick made a face at the taste of the beer. He swore this was his first time drinking one, but part of him also felt like drinking two or three of these a night would not be completely out of character for him. Cameron laughed a little when he notices Patrick wrinkling his nose.<br />
<br />
Tom likewise eased up as he sipped at the beer, and found himself leaning slightly against Zack. Zack who was pulling a pack of cards out of his pocket with a devilish grin. &quot;So, who wants to play that old camping favorite, strip poker?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom almost choked on his beer, Cameron looked eager, and Patrick nervous. There was no one who said no though so Zack began to deal out the cards, grinning widely as he did so.<br />
<br />
Several rounds later and the boys were laughing and working on their second beers. Only Patrick showing any signs of being tipsy. The mouse was also down to only his underwear. With his new build the other boys were giving him some appreciative looks. Looks he wasn&#39;t used to, but welcomed all the same.<br />
<br />
Zack was down to just his pants and underwear, flexing his chest at Tom to distract him while he thought of his next move. This hand was down to just him and Cameron at this point. Tom surprisingly had only had to shed his shoes and the scarf around his neck so far. He was better at cards than Zack would have guessed.<br />
<br />
Cameron was in a similar state to Patrick, sitting in only his jock. At least until Tom called. Both of them laid out their hands and Tom let out a whoop of excitement. With a sigh the Tanuki stood up and removed his jock, tossing it aside and letting his boys swing free. Tom let out a low whistle of appreciation at the two large heavy orbs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t kidding.&quot; He said with a look to Zack who nodded.<br />
<br />
Cameron grinned and rocked his hips a little causing the twin orbs to sway. Then walked around the table till he was standing between Zack and Tom. &quot;Go ahead, give one a little heft.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom looked up at the tanuki a little shocked but then did as told, putting his hand under one of the oversized balls and giving it a little heft as Zack started dealing out the next hand. Tom licked his lips and got so distracted from tanuki balls swinging by his head he lost his lead to a very come from behind mouse.<br />
<br />
Soon Cameron and Zack both sat completely naked, legs spread with their impressive members out for all to see. Patrick still sat in just his underwear and Tom was down to the same after losing a string of hands to the mouse. The hands fell on the table and Patrick leaped out of his seat with a cheer. Tom just sighed and stood up to strip off his underwear, letting it fall to the floor.<br />
<br />
Zack raised an eyebrow. The wolf was hiding quite a bit in that underwear. He wasn&#39;t as imposing as either the zebra or tanuki were, but he was hardly average. Then Patrick was stripping out of his underwear. &quot;Well, if everyone else is naked, I feel silly wearing clothes.&quot; The mouse was no longer as ashamed of his body as he was. And even his member wasn&#39;t as tiny as it had been this morning. It was still on the small side, but it fit him. It was just right for his small frame.<br />
<br />
None of the counselors were really sure how it started. Patrick at one point plopped himself down in Cameron&#39;s lap, another comment led to Zack and Cameron locking muzzles to kiss as the other two cheered them on. Or it could have been Tom hefting Zack&#39;s cock in one hand and Cameron&#39;s balls in the other trying to determine which weighed more, but eventually all four were in a pile of blankets and pillows on the floor.<br />
<br />
Muzzles and cocks traded places as easily as some rears. Patrick was on all fours eventually with his ass in the air, Cameron&#39;s balls swaying heavily as he pumped his cock inside the mouse&#39;s plump cheeks. But Patrick could only moan as he had his mouth busy attending to a wolf cock and zebra cock at the other end. A while later Tom was taking his turn on Zack&#39;s cock as he sucked off Cameron, the mouse below him still tending to his erection and stroking off his own. Zack and Cameron even took their turns frotting each other as the other two watched on giving each other hand jobs to the sight of the two well endowed jocks going at it. Pent up emotions and frustrations poured out of all four until they fell asleep in a tangle of limbs, all worn out, all pleased, and all together.</p>
