<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy turned the water on and stepped into the shower. Lancer followed him in. He shivered a little under the water, clearly unused to having water hit bare skin before.<br />
<br />
&quot;It just, falls right off of you immediately,&quot; he marveled, watching the water bounce off him. Since the shower was set for Troy&#39;s height, as a second person in the shower, it only reached Lancer&#39;s abs from where he was standing. Troy turned and adjusted the showerhead. He felt Lancer&#39;s big hands rubbing Troy&#39;s shoulders and then his chest from behind. He stepped closer and leaned in to kiss Troy&#39;s neck. Troy leaned into it and closed his eyes. He could feel Lancer&#39;s dick brushing up against him. Troy turned around. He didn&#39;t think he&#39;d be ready for that just yet. He instead looked into Lancer&#39;s eyes. Lancer was trying to contain a smile.<br />
<br />
Troy grabbed the soap from the shelf and squirted some onto his hand. He glanced at Lancer&#39;s big chest, which was just below eye-level for Troy, and squirted some more soap onto his hand. Setting the bottle down, he began to rub the soap onto Lancer&#39;s bare chest. Lancer shivered again and let out a slight involuntary moan. Troy chuckled and shook his head. He took stock of Lancer&#39;s body as he massaged it.<br />
<br />
He was very muscular, beefy and cut at the same time. His body hair was surprisingly reduced down to a simple treasure trail that began just below his belly button. There was some hair on his arms and legs, but it wasn&#39;t much. His chest was completely devoid of any body hair whatsoever. The muscle was firm and hard beneath Troy&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
He was just about to kneel down and admire the treasures below the waist when he heard his phone ringing. And it wasn&#39;t just any ringtone; it was the ringtone he set for Mr. Anderson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is that music coming from? Did your kingdom just lose a battle? It sounds... remorseful,&quot; Lancer wondered.<br />
<br />
Troy huffed. &quot;No, that would be the sound of my boss from work trying to get a hold of me.&quot; He quickly rinsed himself off and stepped out. &quot;He normally doesn&#39;t do this, so it could be an urgent thing. I need to deal with this for a moment. Do you...?&quot; He trailed off.<br />
<br />
Lancer waved him off. &quot;Go handle that. I can finish in here.&quot; Troy smiled apologetically before rushing downstairs where he left his phone. It had started ringing again. Oh god.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, this is Troy,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Troy,&quot; Mr. Anderson&#39;s voice greeted him curtly. &quot;I had been meaning to tell you that Mark spoke with me earlier today about your performance lately. Before you get all worked up, it was a positive review of your talents. I can&#39;t say with any certainty yet as I need to discuss this with various people, but I would like to move you up from your current position.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, really? That&#39;s... I don&#39;t know what to say, sir,&quot; Troy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The new position will come with a slight pay raise and a stipend to get your new office settled how you like it, once we get back into the office anyway,&quot; Mr. Anderson continued. &quot;It does have increased responsibilities from your current position. Once I have the official paperwork squared away, we can discuss this further. But I wanted to let you know that your efforts haven&#39;t gone unnoticed. Drink an ale tonight in celebration, boy. I&#39;ll speak with you on Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay. Thanks, Mr. Anderson,&quot; Troy replied. And with that, Mr. Anderson hung up. Troy set the phone down. Normally, Troy would be over the moon, but something seemed off. Why hadn&#39;t Mr. Anderson discussed this with him earlier? Why did he feel the need to call Troy directly?<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything alright?&quot; Lancer asked, walking up behind Troy. He rubbed Troy&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Wow, you seem really tense right here.&quot; He squeezed and massaged Troy&#39;s shoulders and neck. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure, but wow, you are good at that!&quot; Troy looked up at Lancer. He was completely naked but mostly dry, save for some water droplets here and there. &quot;How are you so good at that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a common technique to relax the muscles after battle,&quot; Lancer replied. &quot;Many of my fellow soldiers have needed this technique.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re saying you give other men massages regularly?&quot; Troy asked with a sly smile. &quot;Should I be jealous?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s completely platonic,&quot; Lancer said. He stepped back. &quot;Besides, I&#39;m not... attractive enough for them to return any advances, were I to give any.&quot; Troy frowned. That&#39;s the second time Lancer has said something like that. Is he really that self-conscious or have people told him straight lies about his appearance?<br />
<br />
&quot;Go get dressed,&quot; Troy told him. Lancer instantly turned to his clothes and started pulling them on. Interesting. Even as a human, he still obeyed Troy&#39;s command. &quot;Before we go get something to eat, let&#39;s get you some human clothes that will make you look incredible. How does that sound to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s what you wish,&quot; Lancer said with a shrug. Good enough, Troy figured.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Getting Lancer into a car was... entertaining. The &quot;chariot&quot;, as he called it, was nothing like he was familiar with. He almost jumped out of the car when it came on. As they moved along, Lancer had gripped Troy&#39;s hand tightly to calm his nerves. Troy may or may not have made some comments about someone being a scaredy cat, which may or may not have earned him a glower from said scaredy cat. But as they drove along, Lancer silently absorbed everything around him, for the most part. They quickly shuffled into a clothing store without really drawing too much attention. However, one of the cashiers eyed Lancer&#39;s attire curiously as they came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you think?&quot; Troy asked Lancer quietly. &quot;Is there anything you&#39;d like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer looked at the clothes around them with utter bewilderment. &quot;What do you think would look good on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy shook his head. &quot;Lancer, is this something you even want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer blushed. &quot;Y-yeah, I guess. But-&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy put a hand to Lancer&#39;s lips, silencing him. &quot;But nothing. If you want this, then nothing is stopping us from doing this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer sighed. &quot;Okay then.&quot; His eyes drifted over to a rack of t-shirts. &quot;This looks similar to what you&#39;re wearing, although I don&#39;t really care for the color.&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy frowned and looked at his green shirt. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Green is the main color of our enemy kingdom&#39;s flag,&quot; Lancer said.<br />
<br />
Troy blinked. &quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer than smirked and whispered, &quot;It looks good on you though.&quot; Now it was Troy&#39;s turn to blush. They perused the racks, grabbing different clothes and various styles.<br />
<br />
After about fifteen minutes, Troy said, &quot;Okay. How&#39;s about you try these on?&quot; Lancer shrugged and immediately started to undo the strapping of his armor. &quot;UH... NO!&quot; Troy quickly lowered his voice. &quot;Not out here! You can&#39;t just strip in public here. Maybe that&#39;s a thing in your dimension but not here!&quot; He gestured to the fitting room. &quot;Go in there and lock the door behind you. You can try everything out in there. If there&#39;s anything you want help with putting on, just call for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Troy, I know how clothes work,&quot; Lancer replied. He grabbed the pile of clothes out of Troy&#39;s hands and walked into the fitting room.<br />
<br />
Troy sighed. He leaned against a nearby wall and waited.</p>
