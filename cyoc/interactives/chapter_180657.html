<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Man, Danny really wanted to join in on Jackson&#39;s impromptu fitness challenge, just to show everyone how it&#39;s done. However, besides the fact that it was close to his curfew, it was just easier to observe the competitors this way. Like how Sam occasionally stole glances at Jackson between reps. The fact that Jackson was now shirtless and sweaty was probably the reason Sam couldn&#39;t keep his eyes off of him. Danny was glad that the seeds of gayness he sowed into Sam&#39;s mind were beginning to bear fruit.<br />
<br />
Ah, but before he could see the results of the challenge, it was time for him to leave. What a shame, but it was still a school night, and Danny had to get in his eight hours. So he and his brother said his goodbyes and headed home.<br />
<br />
After the two got home, Danny got on the Chronovac yet again and pulled up the change he made to Sasha. He decided to put a clause that Sasha is unable to transform any Asian men into twinks. Considering Danny was replacing the old white jocks Sasha infected with the Asian nerds, Danny didn&#39;t want Sasha to reverse that if she gets desperate. He considered doing this for the other races too, but considering Sasha got Brady already, it was probably for the best for Danny to wait and see how that plays out. After that, Danny went to bed, and the next day when he was preparing to go to school, his brother came by to ask him something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Danny? Can I borrow some of your clothes?&quot; Jin peaked in only wearing pajama bottoms, and with that, Danny could tell that his brother bulked up a bit more overnight. He didn&#39;t look too much larger, but apparently, it was enough to have him not fit into his clothes properly. Danny could also tell that certain parts of Jin&#39;s body started to come in like his lats and traps. Signs that Jin&#39;s muscles were shifting from those of someone who worked out on occasion to someone who worked out for aesthetics, just like Danny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, and here I thought only sisters ended up doing this, but sure go right ahead.&quot; His brother ended up choosing a Tank top and tight-fitting jeans. Looks like Jin was also getting more comfortable with his new body if he&#39;s going to wear that to class. &quot;By the way, I think I have time to work out with you tomorrow. That works for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, that works,&quot; Jin replied. &quot;Some of my friends recovered from their food poisoning so, I wanted to hang out with them today.&quot; That and maybe hooking up with another guy to explore his sexuality a bit more. Though that&#39;s something that he&#39;s not going to mention to his little brother.<br />
<br />
Ah right, Jin&#39;s nerdy friends. Danny could only imagine how they would react to the newly hunky Jin. Would they even be comfortable with being friends with him? Sure Danny didn&#39;t change anything about Jin&#39;s personality or interests directly. However, Jin was clear a bit more confident than before. Who knows, maybe Jin&#39;s friends could muscle up too. &quot;Cool, feel free to invite your friends to a workout session too. The more, the merrier after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he headed off to school, Danny said goodbye to his Dad, who was looking thinner than he usually did. Danny had to wonder if his father noticed that he was losing weight. Probably was, but he was also probably keeping his mouth shut about like Jin. Ah, anyway, it was time for school.<br />
--------<br />
<br />
When Danny arrived at school, he was surprised to see a small group of girls creeping on someone. What was more surprising was that they were all creeping on Terry of all people. Although now that he took a better look at him, he could tell that Terry was looking distinctively part Korean. Oh, were all the girls reacting like this because Terry was resembling a K-Pop star now? Danny had to admit, that was rather funny. Especially the fact that Terry, while liking the attention he was getting, didn&#39;t really seem interested in any of the girls anymore. Looks like Terry was fully gay now, not to mention looking skinnier than yesterday. He still had some muscle on him, so he wasn&#39;t quite a twink yet, but in a couple of days, he would be. After the girls dispursed to get to class, Gabe came up to Terry, also looking skinnier and more Asian. Perhaps he was now part Thai? Honestly, it was hard to tell in Gabe&#39;s case.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey, Terry, are you really going to let all those girls go?&quot; Gabe asked sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, Gabey, still thinking of sex after what happened last night? I guess you really have to find someone else more aggressive than me if you want to fully get rid of those thoughts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh, okay. If you think that will help me turn back to normal...&quot; Man, for a dummy like Gabe was, he a surprising amount of mental fortitude if he still thought he was straight after everything that happened. Well, something like that, at least. Anyway, while Danny would love to find the other, he wanted to get to his Calc class early to see how the nerds were doing.<br />
<br />
It was honestly a rare sight for Danny to arrive early to Calculus, given how much he hated the subject. However, considering the new subject was the transformation of nerds, he was more eager to come to class. Looking around, he did see that some of the nerds bulked up a little over the weekend. Others had their acne begin to clear up or having grown a couple of inches.<br />
<br />
Two of the Chinese nerds who sat near Danny had the most substantial change, however, as those were the two that were going to replace Gabe and Terry on their respective sports team. Considering that Gabe and Terry were probably going to get cut from their teams soon, it was a good call to make them change the quickest out of all the nerds. The two were chubby Kevin and skinny Shen; although they were more muscular than last, he saw them. Danny wanted to listen to their conversation but was distracted when his teacher, Mr. Ito, accidentally knocked a stack of books off his desk.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, Mr. Ito, huh? Once again, Danny found himself tempted to transform his teacher. However, this time, he had an idea. Perhaps when Jackson and everyone else realizes Jackson had aged into a middle-aged man, maybe the muscle daddy could go after Mr. Ito. Danny began getting hard at that thought, but that quickly went away when he realized something. If he didn&#39;t transform Mr. Ito, then there was a possibility that Jackson could try to go after Danny&#39;s own father.<br />
<br />
Sure, that was a leap in logic, but it was enough to convince Danny to transform his teacher into a hunk. Pulling out the Chronovac, Danny quickly typed out the specs he thought were ideal for his teacher. Once that was done, all that was left to do was decide on a time frame for his teacher&#39;s transformation and who Danny should check on next at school.</p>
