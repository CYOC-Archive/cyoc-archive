<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harry was an extremely depressed man. He would eat. Overeat! In order to make himself feel momentarily better. He was always hungry, no matter how much he ate. <br />
<br />
By the time he was 40 years old, he weighed in at a disgusting 420 lbs. His clothes were size 5 XL, and he never bathed properly. He couldn&#39;t work, and my managed to get on disability with food stamps. Neither of which properly paid for his obscene diet. <br />
<br />
Harry had a sister named Katrina. Katrina was 10 years his junior, at the young adult age of 30. She was a successful fashion designer, and the complete opposite of Harry. She kept herself in shape, clean, with a clean diet. <br />
<br />
When Katrina was a kid, she and her friends decided to exore that creepy old mansion. Well, it turned out, to be magical. There was an adventure that a few of her friends and her had gone on. They had gotten into some shenanigans on night in the fall 20 years prior. Long story story short, one of them is still stuck as a statue of his 11 year old self inside that mansion to this day. 20 years later. <br />
<br />
She would still occasionally go down there to check on him, knowing he has been a conscious statue the entire time. The rest of the world had moved on. She was now a successful adult, while that old pal of hers is still stuck as an 11 year old. She&#39;d talk to him when she would visit him, but he would never respond. He couldn&#39;t. He has never moved so much as a millimeter since that fateful day. His face was still in its exact same half-surprised, half-worried puppydog-eyed look. His clothes were slowly beginning to become tattered with rot. She thought about buying him new clothes, but wasn&#39;t sure how to dress him. She never risked taking off the clothes he was still wearing for the past two decades, for fear of not being able to dress him again. <br />
<br />
The older Katrina got, the more she realized that he was just an innocent young boy. Even if he was mischievous. They all were.....<br />
<br />
The house had a few simple rules:<br />
<br />
- All magic tricks were permanent. <br />
- Each kind of magic could be performed on a person one time only. <br />
- Multiple TYPES of magic could be performed, but each TYPE could be performed only ONCE.<br />
- In order to initiate the magical essence of the house, all on had to was recite one of the incantations written in an ancient book while on the property. Each type of magic contained one incantation. For transformation magic, one just had to specify what they wanted a person to turn into. Qualities were allowable.<br />
<br />
This means that her friend, who is just a statue in body, had transformation magic performed on him once. Therefore, he could never be transformed again. Which meant he would always remain a statue. <br />
<br />
Katrina was becoming more and more ashamed of her brother through the years, until one day, she had enough of his disgusting bullshit. <br />
<br />
&quot;If he wants to live like a farm animal and like he&#39;s living in a barn,&quot; she told herself. &quot;He might as well BE a farm animal and actually LIVE in a barn!&quot;<br />
<br />
That sparked an idea. She knew the mansion was on the edge of the neighborhood with its wooded lot behind the house. It had a lot of acreage, and it was up for sale. Katrina had been thinking about investing in some property anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could purchase that old mansion and the surrounding land,&quot; she thought on day. &quot;I could clear a bit of the overgrown woods behind that house and erect a barn for Harry to live in.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, she had. She did purchase that mansion along with 10 acres of forest land out behind the house a few years later. With plans to expand her holdings at some later date. She had a nice patch of treats cleared and uprooted, and hired hired a bunch of Amish contractors to erect a new barn. <br />
<br />
With the property in her name and a perfect living quarters for a jackass like Harry.... &quot;Hhhhhmmmm.... A jackass!&quot; She thought with mirth. She was ready to transport her brother to his new living arrangements. <br />
<br />
Harry had heard rumors about that old mansion being magical. But never believed in that urban legend stuff. His sister came to his place one day to announce she has actually bought that place! She asked if he wanted to come check it, and he definitely did! He rarely moved from his couch, which was sagging and caving in, except to hobble to his bed to sleep. He just spends his life playing video games and eating fast food burgers.<br />
<br />
But the fact that his sister bought a mansion and invited him to check it out, piqued his curiosity. And so, this has become one of an extremely rare occasion where he would venture outside his slobby and scuzzy, trash-ridden apartment. <br />
<br />
&quot;How would you like to live there?&quot; she asked him on the way over, trying not to gag over the god awful smell while driving her SUV with him in the passenger seat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you for real?&quot; he asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Yes! Absolutely!&quot; she said with a titled smirk. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the catch?&quot; he asked skeptically, worried that she would try to make him do all sorts of chores, and maybe get a job. He knew he couldn&#39;t work, and he knew she knew he couldn&#39;t work!<br />
<br />
&quot;No catch,&quot; she lied. &quot;Just a place to stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.....that sounds....nice...&quot; he said, still skeptical. <br />
<br />
Harry felt a bit awkward around his sister. She was so successful, and he was hopeless. So they rode in silence to the house. <br />
<br />
Upon arrival, she parked the SUV around back next to the new barn that contained a stable for a couple of large animals. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t remember any of this stuff being here,&quot; Harry remarked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s because I had it relandscaped with this new barn and a field for grazing animals. Come on! I&#39;ll show you around!&quot;<br />
<br />
They got out of the vehicle, albeit with great difficulty for Harry. She led him to the inside of the barn. It was nice and spacious. But Harry didn&#39;t know why she started the grand tour from the barn. She knew he had bad knees and couldn&#39;t walk very far.....<br />
<br />
But he followed her inside, whereupon, she started saying strange words. Words that contained the parameters of his being upon completion of her incantation. <br />
<br />
 &quot;What in the world...&quot; he wondered, when she ended her foreign language speech with the words: &quot;donkey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you--?&quot; Harry felt suddenly dizzy as his body suddenly ballooned up even more while the world seemed to spin in an sickening fashion as he felt himself falling forward!  &quot;--haaaaawww?&quot; he finished his question simultaneously as he caught himself with his hands somehow, keeping himself from falling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhaaaaw!&quot; he breathed heavily as he blinked a few times. His vision strangely somehow different. A much wider field of vision! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeee hhhaaaaw heeeee hhhhaaaww?&quot; He tried asking *where did that animal come from?* As he was seeing the body of a bloated fat donkey behind him. <br />
<br />
His blood froze in his veins. &quot;Haaaaawww.....?&quot; He tried experimentally. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeeeeee hhhhhaaaaaawwwww....&quot; He tried again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeee haaawwww heeee hhhaawww!?&quot; *What is this!?*<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.....oh....shit!&quot; He thought. &quot;Oh....oh GOD! Am I....am I a....DONKEY!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry instantly got horny! He always had a horror fetish of transforming into the most humiliating creature in existence ....a donkey<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t believe it! He was a fucking DONKEY! &quot;Haaaawww heeeee HHHAAAWWWW!&quot; He brayed! &quot;I&#39;ve been turned into a god damn DONKEY!&quot;<br />
<br />
He looks around at his fat bloated body. Not a trace of humanity to be seen! No hands! <br />
<br />
&quot;I have HOOVES! OH God! I&#39;m a donkey!&quot; Haaaawww....he brayed outward, unable to speak! <br />
<br />
He looked down and in between his legs, and saw a most horrifying site: a gigantic black one-eyed donkey shlong that was now his, and permanently attached to him! With two huge wobbly rubbery balls that were now churning out donkey DNA instead of human DNA! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeee hhhhaaaww!&quot; He cried as he tried to grip his dick, to no avail. Unable to &quot;open&quot; or &quot;close&quot; his hooves, which just remained solidly one shape! &quot;CLOP!&quot; When his hood on the hard wooden barn floor to better balance himself again after lifting that leg to attempt to grab himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.....SHIT!&quot; He thought to himself as it sunk in that he actually was a donkey now! For real! That he had no hands with which jerk himself off with, and no ability to speak! <br />
<br />
The only way he could get himself off, is by either mating with another animal, or lowering himself to the ground, in order to hump the ground! And that&#39;s exactly what he did.... For the next TWO YEARS! <br />
<br />
He was both excited and horrified to be stuck as a four-legged creature. The more time that passed, the more he realized that it REALLY sucked being stuck as a fucking donkey on a full-time basis. His fetish fantasy of imagining what life would be like as a donkey, would only last a 15 minute to a half hour or so before he would successfully ejaculate. Then it would always be off to find something to eat, and play video games for the rest of the day. <br />
<br />
As an actual bonifude donkey, he was forced to remain on all fours. All the time! Every single second of every single minute, of every single hour, of every single day; for week after week. Month after month. Season after season. Year after year. Until one day, a small group of kids had dropped by....<br />
<br />
But in the meantime, Katrina felt bad about condemning her older brother to such a life. Katrina had promised him she would make into a human again. They had developed their system of &quot;yes/no&quot; questions as Harry practiced trying to write letters in a circle of dirt in his barnyard.<br />
<br />
Over the course of those two years, Katrina had come to realize one day, like a lightbulb going off, that a body-swap is a type of magic on its own! That it has not been performed on Harry!  She had an idea of setting a trap for anyone who dared to cross over the threshold of Harry&#39;s barn! Anyone but her, that is. She said an incantation over the threshold. <br />
<br />
Even though she had cast a protective spell on herself, the very idea of becoming her horrendous donkified brother made me gag so far, she puked. The risk was far too great, so she was very careful to never enter that barn once she had cast the body-swap spell. As a result, that barn became a horrendous animal sty on the inside. Full of shit, piss, and equine semen. She has purchased a stallion as a companion for Harry, whom she had made gay for horsecock during her initial incantation against him. <br />
<br />
And so, this has been the long, boring, and and extremely irritating 2 year life of Harry as a human mind stuck with the body of a fat and gross donkey. Stuck to a life on all fours, and unable to ever speak. Until his replacement had FINALLY arrived.....</p>
