<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*I&#39;m trying to get back into the swing of things. Might take a while, but I should be back back soon. First real chapter I&#39;ve written in a long time, so it probably isn&#39;t that good. <br />
<br />
While Peter was busy struggling to come to grips with what that mysterious man-dragon had said, his family were impatiently waiting for any news about his condition. Jean and Nate sat together, one holding the other as tears silently streamed down her cheeks. <br />
<br />
Leon was busy pacing the length of the emergency room, hoping for any bit of good news. Peter wasn’t going to die, Leon just knew it. His son was a fighter, his son would make it. Regina on the other hand was all but planning Peter’s funeral. Even weres had limitations to their healing abilities. Though they didn’t know where Peter had been shot, they knew it was grave enough that he had to go into surgery. <br />
<br />
Nate heard the ER doors open and close, and when he looked up was surprised to see Evan Lawson walking through with a large backpack. He knew Maggie worked at the hospital, but she was on maternity leave. The only explanation…. <br />
<br />
“She must be giving birth right now!” Nate muttered. He wasn’t exactly wrong, Maggie was there. But she’d already delivered. She and Evan Junior were resting comfortably in another wing of the hospital. Evan merely went home to grab a few more things and then rushed back to be with his wife and newborn son. <br />
<br />
“Nate, what are you doing here?” Evan saw the young werewolf, and immediately jumped to the conclusion that his parents or Eric were in trouble. Though in hindsight, if Eric was in any trouble Spencer would have told her parents by now. <br />
<br />
“My fiancee’s brother was shot during a mugging.” Nate said in a solemn voice. Evan looked from Nate to Jean, and then to Leon. Evan wasn’t that familiar with Moon Lake’s denizens, but he knew the Lion King. A simple nod between the two sufficed to convey Evan’s sympathy. He continued along to the maternity ward where his wife was. <br />
<br />
As Evan departed, Tora Tachibana appeared. His scrubs were bloody, and his face was strained. Leon and Regina jumped to their feet to learn the fate of their son. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Peter made it through the surgery.” Tora immediately said. Both parents breathed a sigh of relief. Jean and Nate hung back, but overheard everything. Jean sighed and then buried her face in Nate’s shoulder. She’d come far too close to losing him. Even if Peter was a pain in the ass, he was still her brother. <br />
<br />
“Can we see him?” Leon asked. <br />
<br />
“At the moment, no. We’re transferring him to a private ward. While in the ambulance, he shifted. We’re keeping in in the operating room until we can be sure no normals will catch sight of him. Once he’s settled in his room you can go in, but only for a short time.” Tora said. <br />
<br />
“How bad are his injuries?” Regina asked fearfully. <br />
<br />
“The bullet went into his abdomen. We extracted the bullet and then his body did the rest. It will still take him a few days to fully recover, but Peter should be able to go home by Monday at the latest.” Tora replied. Regina thanked Tora and went to sit with Jean and Nate. Tora then motioned to Leon to follow him away from the rest of his family. Leon knew there was more to the story, and clearly Tora didn’t think it was suitable for his wife’s or his daughter’s sensitive ears. <br />
<br />
Darting around a corner and then into an empty office, Leon asked Tora what else had happened. <br />
<br />
“I was informed that he broke the arm of one of the paramedics who was treating him in the ambulance, which is when he shifted.”<br />
<br />
“He what?”<br />
<br />
“Peter’s adrenaline was pumping, I imagine he was delirious. We’re at no risk of exposure, and the paramedic isn’t going to press charges or anything of that nature. But he did tell me that Peter kept mumbling something about not being gay.” Tora said. <br />
<br />
“Peter isn’t gay.” Leon said confused. <br />
<br />
“I’m just telling you what the paramedics said. Peter woke up and that was the only thing he was saying. Repeating over and over actually.” Tora said with a shrug. Leon furrowed his brow, wondering why on earth his son would suddenly start blurting out to the world he wasn’t gay. <br />
<br />
“Is Peter keeping something from us? I’ve spent so much time fussing over Jean as of late, maybe he was trying to tell me something and I just wasn’t paying attention.” Leon wondered. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“I’m not gay.” Peter mumbled again. The nurse in his room stared peculiarly at the now calm werelion. He wasn’t sure why he kept saying that, but he was. Kyle went to the lion’s beside, checking his vitals and casually sizing him up. Even unconscious with a large portion of his stomach shaved from surgery, Peter Talbot was quite attractive. As a werecat himself, Kyle couldn’t help but be attracted to the sizable sheath between Peter’s well toned thighs. <br />
<br />
“I’m not gay.” Peter said again. Kyle wondered if Peter was just babbling in his drug induced state, or if his words actually meant something. Was the werelion gay? As far as Kyle knew Peter Talbot was straight. But being the son of the Lion King must be stressful. Maybe he hadn’t realized until now… or maybe…<br />
<br />
Kyle’s thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the door creaking open. He looked up to see Peter’s parents and sister entering the room. Another boy, a werewolf by the scent, hung outside to give the family some privacy. Kyle quickly finished his work and then darted out of the room, embarrassed to be thinking about romancing the unconscious were in front of his family. <br />
<br />
Nate watched as the male nurse hurried off, and caught his scent as that of a werecat. He looked back at Jean and her parents as they started at Peter’s unmoving form. The area where the stiches were was shaved of fur. Peter’s tail hung off the side of the bed, and his main appeared quite sweaty. <br />
<br />
Regina ran her hand across Peter’s face, inadvertently waking him. Peter woke with a start, and immediately tried to get up. <br />
<br />
“Peter, it’s ok. Calm down son.” Leon said, placing his hands gently on Peter’s chest. Hearing his father’s voice, and smelling familiar scents seemed to help, and Peter slowly laid back down. <br />
<br />
“How are you feeling?” Jean asked.<br />
<br />
“That’s a stupid question, I got shot.” Peter scoffed. He was in a foul mood, not because of being shot but because of what that man had told him in his dream. He wasn’t gay, he wasn’t. He didn’t look at guys like that. Sure, in high school he’d taken peeks at a few in the shower, but he didn’t think of any of them as potential mates. Maybe his eyes lingered a bit too long but…<br />
<br />
“I’m not gay!” Peter screamed in his head, tail angrily flicking beside him. <br />
<br />
“Are you sure you’re alright Peter, you seem very agitated by something.” Leon looked pointedly at his son’s twitching tail. <br />
<br />
“I’m fine, just a little tired is all. And hungry, I never got a chance to eat anything.”<br />
<br />
“You’re kidding, right? You just got shot and you’re thinking about food?” Jean almost laughed. <br />
<br />
“Yes, why is that such a shock to you? Not all of us can be overfed, sex beasts. Maybe you’ve spent too much time with your head between Nate’s legs to remember other people matter too.” Peter snapped. Everyone drew a sharp breath, and it took everything in Nate’s power not to strangle Peter. He didn’t care if that was Jean’s brother, no one insulted his mate like that. <br />
<br />
“What the hell is your problem? Jealous because I’ve found someone to settled down with and all you can get is a one night stand?”Jean hissed back, also struggling to keep her own fursona at bay. <br />
<br />
“Enough. Jean don’t antagonize your brother. And Peter…” Leon wasn’t sure what to say to his son. He had about a million things he wanted to say, but in front of everyone while Peter was still recovering from his wounds? <br />
<br />
“Can you give me a minute alone with Peter?” Leon asked. Regina nodded, confused as one could expect, but lead Jean out of the room. Nate hung close to Jean, glaring at Peter all the while. Peter rolled his eyes, knowing that Nate had no idea what he was getting himself into. The kid was nice, but how could he think of marriage so early? Why not play the field for a while? Enjoy being a bachelor in his prime instead of settling for the world’s most self absorbed, pompous sister? <br />
<br />
“Alright, out with it mister. What’s gotten into you? I understand you’re not exactly comfortable, but that’s no excuse to lash out at Jean. She’s only worried about you.” Leon asked his son as soon as the others were gone. <br />
<br />
“I dunno. Just in a bad mood.” Peter grumbled. <br />
<br />
“Right. Well I think we’ll give you the night to change your poor attitude. But I don’t want to come back tomorrow to find you’ve attacked the staff.” <br />
<br />
“Why would I do that? They’re not the ones parading around with some stupid werewolf arm candy, pretending to be the Queen of Sheba.” Peter growled. <br />
<br />
Leon was about to say something when Kyle returned with Peter’s pain medication. <br />
<br />
“Sorry sir, but since he’s awake now he needs to take these.” Kyle shrank back from the two angry werelions. Leon sighed, giving Peter one more stern look before taking off. Peter didn’t so much as say goodbye, he was so fed up with everyone. Save for this werecat, who was apparently his nurse. He was just doing his job, and he did get his father out of his mane for now. <br />
<br />
“You couldn’t have picked a better time to show up.” Peter said once his father had gone. <br />
<br />
“Really? Seemed like the worst time.” Kyle said, counting out the medicine. <br />
<br />
“Believe me, it was perfect. The old man was this close to ripping out my jugular.” Peter said. <br />
<br />
“I’m glad he didn’t. I’d have to clean up the mess.” Kyle joked. Peter laughed, but stopped when he found it agitated the pain in his stomach. <br />
<br />
“So, how long am I going to be here?” Peter asked. <br />
<br />
“I’m no doctor, but I think they said just for the weekend.” <br />
<br />
“Sorry you got stuck taking care of me. I’m probably turning out to be the worst patient ever.” <br />
<br />
“Hardly, thus far you’re one of the best.” The words left Kyle’s mouth before he realized what he’d meant. Now blushing, Kyle quickly finished his work and then said goodnight to Peter, who was left bewildered. <br />
<br />
“Huh, wonder what his deal is? Certainly left in a hurry. Oh well, at least I get some peace and quiet now.” Peter made himself comfortable and then drifted back into sleep. Hoping and praying that man didn’t visit his dreams again.</p>
