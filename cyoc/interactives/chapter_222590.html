<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;As you command,&quot; says the genie in a bored voice and snapping his fingers.<br />
He doesn&#39;t sound impressed, this genie. Rather uninterested in what you ask as wishes. Maybe he&#39;s just grouchy. At any rate, you still do not see how the genie could screw you over with this wish. Alas, that is where you&#39;re wrong. The genie thought in a jiffy how to interpret your wish and he found results that he would find very entertaining. For him, of course. Certainly not for you. With a snap of his fingers, the scenery changed drastically, furniture and walls turning into blue fog and reforming into dense bushes and trees right in front of your surprised eyes. Your comfy couch turned into moist, muddy ground. Genie clapped his hands and enjoyed your dumbfounded expression.<br />
&quot;Enjoy,&quot; says the genie and giggles maliciously.<br />
<br />
The lamp turns black and disappears into the fog as you are left standing, staring around and taking in the changes. You are in the middle of an unfamiliar jungle, trees reaching up high, further than you can see. Dense, green leafs and branches covering the sun and letting only a few rays of light reach the ground, shining like spotlights here and there.<br />
As the last remains of carpet and furniture melt into muddy jungle floor, you examine your surroundings with shy steps... Shoes getting stuck in the sticky surface you step on, the echoes of unknown animals in the distance, the odd feeling that strange carnivorous plants turn around to face you between the thick greenery...<br />
It feels like some kind of fantasy nightmarish land, a dangerous jungle full of surreal, deadly elements that could only be conceived in old adventure novels, horror comics or fever dreams. Strange vines move around by themselves, seeking something to strangle and drag into their green, thorny arms. Unknown tree barks shine in yellow, red and purple, poisonous or edible fruit hanging from the branches, most of the fruit looking large and ripe, although they were secretly deadly spiky traps.<br />
You rub your eyes, still not believing what happened. This genie seemed more evil than anticipated. And you didn&#39;t anticipate much to begin with. Curious howling sounds creep closer from behind the tall trees, the howls of giant beasts.<br />
<br />
The thick atmosphere of the jungle starts to wear you down after a few minutes of exploring, and you sit down with your back against a giant jungle tree. Everything here feels prehistoric, giant, lethal... What did Genie even intend sending you here? Were you going to become &quot;fierce&quot; trying to survive the jungle?!...<br />
You pant and breath heavily, vision getting foggy, distracting you from the fact you were sitting right in front of a giant footprint, the tip of your shoe barely touching the relief it left behind... <br />
Your internal temperature began to rise, breathing getting more difficult, <br />
heart rate increasing... Your clothes felt heavier and started to irritate your<br />
skin...<br />
The genie laughs and enjoys the view from his lamp, which he transported here along with you. He watches you from the inside of his lamp, currently in the form of a hole between tree roots, invisible to you. The genie keeps a close eye on what you are transforming into, eager to see how you would react.<br />
You try to stand up, but your body feels heavy and hot, vision getting worse, the shoe touching the footprint throbbed unnaturally, and you wheezed as your entire body pulsed at the rhythm of your heartbeat. You fall forward, hands breaking the fall, sinking into the footprint... Your shoe throbbed more aggressively, muscles twitching, chest and stomach feeling tight, back pulsing in an unknown rhythm...<br />
<br />
Your wheezing transforms into panting and grunting, the genie giggles excited as you finally realize something is happening. You shake your head and try to focus, grabbing the roots of the tree and pulling yourself up. Roots bending under your newfound strength.<br />
Your shoes began to creak, and sitting down once more due to the uncomfortable feeling in the zone, you held your foot close to you, alarmed by the sudden snapping of the shoe material and the violent ripping of the socks beneath, revealing thick skin growing underneath, the shoe tearing apart right under your amazed, horrified eyes.<br />
You grunted as you could see the relief of your toes pushing against the tip of your shoes along with a pulsing, tight sensation, before ripping the shoes apart completely, thick, hairy skin revealed in your feet, swollen and pulsing, feeling both hot and throbbing, extraordinarily heavy and big...<br />
The genie saw great potential, rubbing his hands and anticipating your transformation to continue...<br />
You grabbed your sock, confused and panting, and pulled it down along with the remains of your shoes, feeling the ticklish sensation of long, dark hair covering thick, pulsing feet, bigger than the rest of your legs.<br />
<br />
Apart from the thick coat of fur and the chipped black nails on your toes, their very structure looked vastly different, enlarged toe joints making your feet look like giant monkey paws...<br />
You gulped and examined your feet, confused, feeling the pulsing sensation on your toes and the thick, muscular skin, feeling almost like a paw, but still looking like human feet...<br />
The genie moves trees aside, curious about your reaction and enjoying the slow process.<br />
Shocked, you tried to put on the remains of your socks once more, to stop the tingly sensation on your feet, but the socks barely covered the massive, throbbing toes, and the ripped remains of your shoes were completely destroyed when you tried to force them back on your feet due to your immense growing strength. The first hint at your next change, you take a look at your hand just to see hairs emerging down your forearms and over your hands and fingers, while a similar throbbing sensation hints at the futile attempt of your body to contain the growth about to come...<br />
You panic, panting and grunting, feeling the new hair itch and the pulsing sensation on your toes arousing faint pressure.<br />
<br />
You scratched your arm, the thick, black hairs tickling and covering your fingers, blocking the view of the nails that grew darker, thicker and longer...<br />
You stare at your fingers and start shaking, the sensation in your feet and hands distracting you from a building pressure on your spine that would soon result in further changes.<br />
Your hands grew freakishly large, much like your feet, accentuating the odd disproportion of your growing body... Muscles bulged and became tense, your shirt and pants starting to feel uncomfortably tight...<br />
You grunt and gasp, the genie laughs maliciously inside his hole between tree roots, only noticed by a faint breeze.<br />
Your spine throbs and grows, bones creaking and muscles expanding, leaving your head dizzy and your torso immobile, while the pulsing sensation on your toes developed into impatience, increasing the size and hairiness of your enlarged monkey paws. Pulses that match your accelerated heartbeat make your pectoral muscles inflate and push against your shirt, a change accentuated by the sudden growth in length and curve of your spine, pushing your torso forward, much like a gorilla...<br />
<br />
You pant and wheeze, saliva accumulating and dripping down your lips, a powerful heartbeat pounding on your chest...<br />
Your shirt rips apart, underpants snapping at the sides and left behind, forgotten and torn, as your body grew increasingly hairy and massive, the black coat of hair thickening, covering your chest, back and waist, contrasting with the now pinkish, thin skin, blushed and pulsing. Muscles on your chest and stomach tightened and pulsed, back musculature feeling constricted by the limits of your own body, sweat coming out of your pores, the genie cheers and watches closely as you slip out of your remaining clothes and stand up shaking, confused, panicked...<br />
You press your hand against the tree bark and leave an imprint of your fist,<br />
noticing your increased size and strenght... The action gives you a clear view of the changes on your arms and shoulders, skin thinning and hairs becoming thicker, covering your arms from the wrists to the shoulders, muscles pulsing and pectorals inflating and tightening...<br />
<br />
Your panicked wheezing transforms into spontaneous grunts.<br />
You pressed your fist against the tree again, noticing how easy the bark gave in, the tree creaking and leaning back. This tree used to be wider than your body, now you could crush it with a single, thick, leathery hand! Just how big were you becoming?...<br />
Your pectorals inflated and tightened further, nipples enlarging and becoming pinkish, sensitive, on your  massive, pulsing pectorals... You press your hand against the bark once more, leaving a bigger fist mark, noticing the increased hairiness, pulse and weight of your arms and hands, followed by a change on the shoulder blades and chest area, skin thinning and muscles pushing, bones creaking and groaning, new musculature forming over the old one, shoulders growing freakishly large and giving you an impressive posture, making you look like a giant. <br />
While your arms grew longer and muscular, a different change happens to your legs, as you find your knees almost permanently bending, while your thighs and calves expand. Along with the changes on your spine and hips, it seems your body has evolved into a more quadrupedal stance, although it seems you can still stand up on two legs for some time if you wanted to...<br />
Your panicked wheezing transforms more pronounced grunts, along with increasing difficulty to breathe...<br />
You bend your new knees, surprised and wheezing, barely able to keep your balance, confused and scared, watching the tree almost fall over due to the punch marks on the bark, before noticing a sudden pulsing and swelling sensation on your buttocks, muscles tightening and bones creaking on the lower back area, groaning as your rear bumps against the tree, almost leveling it entirely with your massive cheeks, now completely covered in thick, shiny dark fur.<br />
<br />
You pant and notice the increasing size of your genitals, throbbing and pulsing,<br />
swelling on a rhythm that matched the rest of your changes, distracted by the increasing size of your arms and hands, pectorals pulsing and tightening further, pink nipples enlarging and becoming black and sensitive.<br />
You scratched your massive, pulsing pectorals and twitched, shocked at the increasing size and hairiness of your growing body, grunting confused and surprised, before a sudden change on your nether regions makes you howl in surprise, a haunting mix of a human yell and the beastly roar of a giant creature.<br />
Your testicles grow freakishly massive, skin blushing, while the penis enlarges, pulsing and throbbing, becoming thick, large and curved, swinging violently, pulsing and inflating, reaching a length and thickness similar to your arm, as the genie cheered and anticipated the next change, about to happen...<br />
You wheezed and panted, arms and hands pulsing, pectorals tight and full,<br />
testicles massive and hanging, penis growing thick and heavy, stiff and full of pressure, swinging back and forth, impossible to ignore, the tip flattening, ridges growing across its length, starting to become some odd shape you&#39;ve never seen in an animal before, making you doubt if you&#39;re becoming an actual ape species from real life; the member looking more like a pulsing, throbbing pink cylinder.<br />
You grab your penis, surprised and shocked, wheezing and panting, alarmed at the increasing hairiness and pulse on your arms and hands, pectorals pulsing and fully covered in thick, shiny dark fur.<br />
You grunted with a much deeper, beastly voice, thicker neck and throat allowing powerful vocalizations along with the massive lungs in your obscenely large torso. You touched your face as its skin became thicker, darker, and leathery. You frowned and clenched your teeth as the pulsing changes took over your previously unchanged, tiny, pathetic human head. Your jaw expanded and changed shape, forehead getting bigger and eyebrows becoming thick, round and dark, enhancing a permanent frown, eyes surrounded by thick, dark coat of fur, looking menacing, angry...<br />
<br />
You scratch your face and wheeze, shocked and panicking, as the genie giggles inside his hole between tree roots... Be careful what you wish for!...<br />
You grunt and pant, feeling a sudden pressure on the nose, cheekbones and jaw area, skin thickening, and a sudden change on the frontal part of your head that made you grab it and scream in pain, confused, horrified, startled... Your skull changed shape, forehead getting larger and lower, while the ears pushed back, a clear hint you were not becoming a gorilla species, but something else, much more beastly, prehistoric and threatening...<br />
Your screaming transforms into loud, powerful howling, deep and frightening,<br />
penis pulsing and twitching, testicles massive and hanging, foot perfectly aligned with the massive footprint from before, soon starting to match its size.<br />
You wheeze and panic, grunting and howling, massive, leathery hands scratching your skull, changing further shape, forehead getting extremely large , nostrils enlarging and becoming black, the genie cheers and enjoys the results, a much more ferocious creature than expected...<br />
<br />
Your huge hands holding the growing mouth with ferocious fangs and teeth you feel forming within your gums. The action makes you look down, and past your massive body, at the footprint you saw before the transformation, your foot perfectly matching its once frightening size... But then outgrowing it. Your howls transforming into beastly screams.<br />
The genie cackles loudly inside his spot, admiring your terrifying form...<br />
Your powerful stomping sends vibrations through the jungle ground, the genie relishes the roaring thunder of every heavy step...<br />
You raise both fists and glare back, trying to see a reflection in the nearby river, your enlarged testicles swinging heavy between the folds of thick, leathery flesh between the legs...<br />
Through the dark, dense, green vegetation, you approach your reflection, widening your pose and tensing your monstrous frame, your musculature rippling and massive, strong pecs jutting outwards.<br />
You didn&#39;t know what to think of this, mere minutes ago you were an ordinary human, but now you&#39;ve become a massive beast, roaring at your own reflection and looking directly at your giant muscles and sharp fangs, your face looked slightly different from the animals you&#39;ve read about, almost resembled a gorilla, but still felt vastly different, more aggressive, cunning, power. A large chestnut-colored humanoid, quadrupedal body with massive, muscular limbs, broad shoulders, a barrel chest, swollen pecs, a trim waist and insane thighs, complete with a rock hard rear and a cock that rivaled them all, but just how did any of that relate to &quot;becoming fierce&quot;?<br />
Did the genie expect you to be fierce due to your intimidating size and strength? What would you even have use of such strength?...<br />
You look around you again, at the aftermath of something so simple to you, heading over to a river to check out your reflection... Thick, huge trees torn in half, boulders crushed into the muddy ground, massive footprints left behind... When you were transported into this mysterious, eery, prehistoric looking jungle, everything seemed so huge, so savage, so insanely more vile and dangerous than anything you&#39;ve known before... But now after this powerful transformation, the gigantic plants, scary-looking flower pods and weird-looking fruit, seemed puny and insignificant, the trees standing at their limit before succumbing to your raw, muscle-enforced anger and strenght, nothing could compare.<br />
<br />
No lions could kill you, no dinosaurs could eat you, not a nuclear disaster would get close... Everything was now no match for you, they could try and tear you, tease and hurt you... But there was nothing out there able to withstand your unstoppable anger and bestial nature, you couldn&#39;t fail... Were these your thoughts? Why did you care about those things? You asked &quot;to be fierce&quot; to stop being bullied and get some chicks, you never even imagined something like this...<br />
You held your head with your massive hands, trying to recall why you made the wish in first place, struggling, confused... Now all you really wanted was to eat their dead bodies and lay with their beaten down souls until you&#39;d do the same to the next ones coming, you didn&#39;t care who they were, or what they looked like, even their names wouldn&#39;t make sense to you anymore, a bunch of irrelevant, small, weak and insignificant primates!...<br />
Your confused stares and dumbfounded grunts turn into primitive yet focused scanning, you could see the smallest, hungriest prey from afar, moving, staring back at the beast standing in its hunting grounds, too big to fail. Too powerful.<br />
<br />
No! Why were you thinking like this! You&#39;re not an ape... You&#39;re not a monster!...<br />
Your changed anatomy didn&#39;t help much either, your huge skull and head only made room for bigger teeth, not a bigger brain.<br />
You held your head again and roared with a beastly groan that sounds more like the cries of a giant carnivore. A beastly reaction with a primal message, leave me alone... Or I&#39;ll gut you alive.<br />
The other apes, the old bully, your mom, the janitor, whoever passed you, will dread to cross paths with you ever again!<br />
Now get gone!<br />
&quot;Wait... The other apes?&quot;<br />
You walked back to where the transformation started, instinctively supporting your weight on your knuckles, not noticing how the top of your head brushed against the jungle&#39;s ceiling of leaves, or how your broad shoulders and wide rear pushed the massive trees away. Your body reached its max height by now, and fierce sure was an understatement at best.<br />
You try to find the footprints from before, a weird instinctive reflex you can&#39;t explain why you&#39;re following, but you do regardless. And when you do... Your feet dwarf them. Now that&#39;s fierce alright.<br />
You grunt and snarl confused, massive, leathery hands touching your changed head once more, remembering something, not quite sure what it was... Did you hit your head during the transformation?...<br />
You look around you, taking in the jungle&#39;s environment, massive trees shaking with every step, fearing your presence, starved carnivorous plants ignored and forgotten, just how big were you? The thought invading your mind, an animalistic sense of pride forming, overriding past human thoughts, generating interesting responses from your body...<br />
<br />
Your penis pulsed and swung, massive testicles hanging heavy, leathery sack swinging,<br />
muscles tight and pulsing, pectorals inflating and weight distributed, pushing against the jungle floor, giving your chest an impressive volume... Your changed head felt too heavy and big, your jaws twitched and your shoulders pulsed, pectorals throbbing and jutting outwards, stomping the fearsome jungle, a kingdom you no longer had to share with anyone.<br />
<br />
Bestial, animal thoughts began attacking your dumber brain... &quot;You&#39;re the strongest&quot;, &quot;You&#39;re the fiercest&quot;, &quot;Fight&quot;, &quot;Eat&quot;, &quot;Mate&quot;...<br />
You grunt and howl, massive hands grabbing your changed head once more,<br />
overwhelmed by confusing instincts, the genie laughs inside his hole between tree roots excited...<br />
Your howling transforms into primitive, aggressive grunting, confused, frightened.<br />
You hold your face and stare at the footprint from before, massive foot dwarfing it, testicles hanging heavy, swinging between the folds of thick, leathery flesh between the legs, scrotum hitting the jungle floor. <br />
Almost no human thoughts were remaining by now. Your shiny dark fur changing slightly, becoming longer and with grey hairs appearing in some areas, scars forming on your body, muscles growing slightly, gonads pumping up, head filling with experience as reality itself  was being rewritten. As if you always were an alpha ape.<br />
<br />
You grunted and howled, massive hands grabbing your changed head once more, overwhelmed by confusing instincts, the genie laughs inside his hole between tree roots excited, while you struggled to fight the bestial thoughts overtaking your mind.<br />
&quot;Fight&quot;, &quot;Eat&quot;, &quot;Mate&quot;...&quot;Rip&quot;, &quot;Gut&quot;...&quot;Kill&quot;...&quot;Maul&quot;...&quot;Strangle&quot;...&quot;Bite&quot;...&quot;Break&quot;...&quot;Destroy&quot;...&quot;Feed&quot;...&quot;MATE&quot;...&quot;MATE&quot;...&quot;MATE&quot;...&quot;<br />
You let out a massive roar into the jungle, birds flying away as silence settles in the otherwise chaotic scenery. You sit down and grunt loudly, and like a simple animal, you unceremoniously grab a hold of your thick, cylindrical member, pre dripping down the completely flat tip as you stroke the leathery, beastly rod. The genie laughs and watches closely, this is where it gets interesting...<br />
You growl and stroke your cock, the pressure building up, leathery hands pulsing, pre spurting out in big jets and splashing your massive thighs, pecs tightening and sweat coming out of your pores.<br />
You grunt and growl, your giant testicles pump up, swelling and tightening, scrotum inflating and swinging, penis pulsing and throbbing, the genie laughs and enjoys the show, anticipating the climax of your transformation... <br />
Thick fog forms around your groins due to the heat, each stroke causing gallons of pre to fall on the jungle ground, creating large pools of mud, the scent attracting other apes... The genie moves trees aside, curious about the visitors...<br />
You grunt and pant, the pressure building up, muscles tightening, testicles swelling...<br />
A couple of apes peek at you from behind the trees, the genie giggles and enjoys the show, anticipating the climax of your transformation...<br />
You grunt and pant, the pressure building up, muscles tightening, testicles swelling...<br />
The two apes come closer to you, looking at your massive body and thick penis with fear and curiosity...<br />
Seems your roars were of a particular kind, able to attract some nearby females. You could tell by their smaller size, ample curves and softer features... You&#39;d be terrified of these gargantuan monsters back as a human, but as your new self you only felt eager to show off your superiority, they will be the perfect mates for the alpha ape!...<br />
Your cock pulsed and throbbed, you stroked faster, your testicles tight, scrotum inflated, swinging...<br />
The two apes looked at your pulsing genitals with curiosity, slowly approaching, you let out a low, menacing growl...<br />
You stroked faster, grunting, panting, growling... <br />
The first female, of a darker shade of fur than you, immediately took initiative and approached your genitals, while the beige colored one felt content sitting next to you and waiting her turn, you grunt and nod, stroking faster, pre spurting out.<br />
Your penis pulsed and throbbed, you stroked faster, grunting, panting, growling, the dark furred ape grabbed your scrotum and fondled your testicles, you roared and threw your head back.<br />
The beige furred ape sat on your leg, curious about the dark furred one&#39;s actions. Meanwhile, you angled your member towards the beastly snatch of the dark furred female, holding her hips and ample rear behind, feeling her huge muscles as you lifted her up and lowered her over your penis, penetrating her in one swift, powerful thrust that made her squeal and moan loudly, almost human-like, arching her back and shaking her rear, while you roared and grunted, releasing even more pre into her.<br />
You grabbed her hips and held her in place, thrusting upwards, growling and grunting, while she screamed in pleasure, moaning and wailing, the beige furred ape sitting on your leg, staring at the act with curiosity and lust, watching the penis going in and out of the dark furred ape&#39;s vagina.<br />
<br />
You grunted and growled, thrusting fast and hard, the female moaned loudly and screamed, while the beige furred ape watched closely, curious and intrigued, you grabbed her ass cheeks and kept thrusting upwards, roaring and growling, the dark furred ape screamed and wailed, drooling over your pectorals, while the beige furred ape moved aside and rubbed her rear against your hand, you grunted and pushed her down, standing up and finally revealing your +400ft frame as you roar in pleasure, beating your chest like the alpha you are, testicles clenching and seed sloshing loudly as you finally release your monstrous, prehistoric sperm, yellowish and chunky. Roars and growls being heard from miles across, signaling to others a new alpha has risen.<br />
You held the dark furred female tightly by her ass cheeks, pulling her in and thrusting your massive tool, while she screamed and wailed, her massive breasts swinging up and down.<br />
<br />
After a few hours of intense breeding, you sit up, your new mates laying by your side, their crotches leaking your seed. You didn&#39;t fear the night, let alone this jungle.<br />
<br />
Galloping through the jungle as if you were familiar with it all your life, you climbed up the tallest mountain you could find, revealing yourself to the rest of the world, letting them know there was a new alpha in town. And this ape is not someone they&#39;ll want to mess with!<br />
You stood there, tall, strong, proud, a powerful, mighty beast that has no equal in this world. No other creature could ever challenge you.<br />
And as you beat your chest in triumph, the genie laughs inside his lamp, watching from the reflection in the nearby river, enjoying the view of the massive alpha ape that you&#39;ve become.</p>
