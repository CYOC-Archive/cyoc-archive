<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Jennifer found the &#39;best ones&#39; to wear. She could hear her mother talking with an older lady. That must have been her grandma. From upstairs Jennifer picked-up that grandma was giving a lot of backhanded comments to Jennifer&#39;s mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still not satisfied with the ones who swings here more than the doors of this household?&quot; Jennfier her grandma commenting. &quot;When will you ever find the one to keep and provide to your needs if you treat men like your socks.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s mother Silvia wasn&#39;t replying anything back as it seemed that she was waiting Jennifer to show up. As she begun to ascend the stairs grandma was changing her tone and approached Jennifer to give her lots of loving hugs. Jennifer was quite taken by how her grandma had changed. Looking like her own mother from the past while her birth mother in the kitchen looked like the eldest daugther.<br />
<br />
Jennifer notice how her mother gave Jennifer a frown her brows and bit her lower lip as grandma Mary was still giving her more hugs. Three or four hugs laters she invited Jennifer to the table with them and as grandma&#39;s and Silvia&#39;s eyes met. It felt. More than weird. As no words were exchanged but it was clear as if Mary was telling Silvia something.<br />
<br />
Mary then noticed Jennifer&#39;s bulging belly as sat on the chair raising the the shirt she wore higher.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was fearing when this would come... Silvia, Do you remember how my own mother was in shambles as she heard about the day when you were born. Oh woe me! It was a tragedy! A-&quot; Mary ranted as Silvia interrupted her by asking if she wanted more coffee.<br />
<br />
Mary silently cackled as Silvia&#39;s face was red as a tomato. Silvia tried not to make eye contact as her mother had made her act different. Jennifer was utterly confused as she had no idea what was going on here but didn&#39;t want to ask further as it could have upset either one.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about Jennifer&#39;s sister&#39;s fate? Unknown? Or did you finally found a husband who stays by your side?&quot; Mary commented as she took a big gulp from the better looking ceramic coffee cup and eyed Silvia&#39;s belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;MOM! Not in front Jennifer!&quot; Silvia shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... You are right Silvia... He was a fine young lad when you two met. Truly a shame.&quot; Mary replied. &quot;Leaving you alone with your daughter after finding out that-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My- Father..?&quot; Jennifer asked as she got a little bit curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. He-&quot; Mary almost begun to form a sentence as Silvia stopped her by slamming the coffee pot in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No! No! NO! NO! NO! MOM! You promised me you wouldn&#39;t bring this up around her UNTIL she old enough to understand!&quot; Silvia screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she&#39;s old enough to hear-&quot; Mary deviously smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! MOM! STOP!&quot; Silvia banged her fist on the table in rhythm. &quot;Time. And. Place!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an awkward silence as all three of them just sat there doing their thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry that I even asked.&quot; Jennifer said as she started to eat the stale bread slice from a plate.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Sweety. Grandma is just... Saying things to be dramatic. Right grandma?&quot; Silvia said as she glanced at Mary.<br />
<br />
Mary didn&#39;t say anything and swallowed the last bits of the coffee down her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dramatic? Poppycock. We&#39;ll see in two weeks who&#39;s the more dramatic here when my own daughter can&#39;t provide me with the missing thousand dollar bill for her own damn rent.&quot; Mary said and gave a spit on the floor. &quot;Asking even for her own mother to ease the rent, as by your &#39;own words&#39; tell me that, don&#39;t worry you get the money by then. I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary then checked her hand watch and turned towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I advice you to call me day early if and when you get that thousand dollar bill as on that day if you can&#39;t find it you&#39;ll be evicted by my own hand. While I make sure that everything that isn&#39;t nailed to the floor flies through the front door. Lastly! Jennifer&#39;s homeschooling ends at this instant. Even if you somehow manage to get those bills I make sure that you are as stranger to me as a any other person. Family or not! Mark my words!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary slammed the door behind her as she walked towards her car. In the distance Silvia and Jennifer heard as she left the premises.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... That could have gone way smoother... I think...&quot; Silvia sheepisly laughed. &quot;Anyway. I believe I had something to show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother opened the freezer and presented Jennifer a small pint cup of ice cream. Jennifer begun to salivate as she had already forgot the argument with her mother and grandma.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that...?&quot; Jennifer said as she wasn&#39;t sure what her mother meant by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s for you. All of it. Here&#39;s a metal spoon so you can finish it one go.&quot; Silvia said as she handed the spoon for her and gave a gentle pat on Jennifer&#39;s stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;WOAH!&quot; Jennifer screamed and begun to devour the small pint all by herself while her mother went upstairs.<br />
<br />
Jennifer had no idea why her mother would be so generous all of a sudden but the ice cream felt so refreshing compared to the other foods she had eaten over the year. Stale bread and watered down coffee wasn&#39;t appealing but it was nutrious according to her mother.<br />
<br />
After half an hour of constant devouring Jennifer felt that she had overeaten for the day. A small brain freeze later Silvia was back at the kitchen, Asking Jennifer if she was willing to clean the house a little bit while her &#39;friend&#39; would visit her in a moment. Her mother told her that tomorrow she had to invite A LOT OF people to come visit her so they could stay living. She gave a small slight grin as she stratched tip of her own nose.<br />
<br />
Jennifer wasn&#39;t sure what is meant by all of that but nodded as she didn&#39;t want to be rude to her own mother and cause more problems. Her mother gave Jennifer a roll of black plastic bags for the trash and two empty plastic basket to collect the dirty clothes to.<br />
<br />
Silvia instructed to fill the bags as many as she could but told that the two baskets had to be full of clothes before sunset. But before she could do it Silvia asked if Jennifer could give her a back massage before the &#39;friend&#39; arrived to meet with her mother.<br />
<br />
Jennifer gulped but did what she asked for.<br />
<br />
After a while there was a knock in the front door and Silvia left Jennifer to do the chore she had tasked for her. Waving her arm as she went upstairs with the &#39;friend.&#39;<br />
<br />
Soon enough there were a lot of banging, intense screaming, joyful yelling and lot&#39;s of moaning as her mother cursed like a sailor and announced to the whole house how massive the &#39;friend&#39;&#39;s cock was. But Jennifer coudn&#39;t hear it. Or at least chose to not listen to it as she had cleaning to do.<br />
<br />
Any further distractions would make her mother angry and that was the last things she wished for. Getting older and fast was what count the most even if it meant doing whatever her mother asked from her. She couldn&#39;t care less what her mother did upstairs as she piled all the clothes on the baskets and opened a freshly bought plastic bag to throw all the trash she could find with her bare hands.<br />
<br />
With chunks of sweat starting pouring from Jennifer&#39;s forehead. She had to take multiple breaks and sit down as it was her first time doing this much physical labor in one go. She had already forgotten that her belly was causing extra weight her to work with. Which made cleaning extra difficult.<br />
<br />
In what little time she had. She had gotten four trash bags full of trash and both baskets full of clothes. Jennifer thought in her mind that she had to get the living room today or her mother would yell at her. Which could cause more problems to her.<br />
<br />
As Silvia was finishing with her &#39;friend&#39; she was amazed how much work Jennifer had done and came to give her a bug bear hug. She was only wearing her underwear so Jennifer was smothered by her mother&#39;s bosom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhh. Mommy&#39;s so proud of you sweety. Mwu-ah. Mwu-ah.&quot; Silvia said as she gave big kisses in both of Jennifer&#39;s cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mooomm....&quot; Jennifer whined as she saw the her mother&#39;s friend still in the front door slowly closing the door.<br />
<br />
Silvia reeked like a fish on a dry land and gave two headpats to her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy will finish the rest by tomorrow so let&#39;s cross fingers that I get enough money that I can buy you more treats tomorrow for the good work you&#39;ve done today.&quot; Silvia smiled.<br />
<br />
Jennifer nodded and was mentally ready to move on to the next year. She almost ignored what her mother had just said as she could buy her own treats and ice cream when she got back to her old 18-year-old body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy to help.&quot; Jennifer smiled back and gave a big thumbs up to her mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy will buy us pizza for dinner. So sweety if you could, go and wait in your room. I have a hunch that there&#39;ll be so bumps in the road for the delivery guy.&quot; Silvia grinned as she begun to swiped her phone frantically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Jennifer said and wobbled slowly back into her own room.<br />
<br />
In reality inside the brain the 18-year-old Jennifer was so tired that she couldn&#39;t stand straight as her legs begun to tremble as she slowly squated and lied down on the dampened mattress. Lying on her back she could only dream of being adult and getting rid of the curse one day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a small nap wouldn&#39;t hurt... As the... Piz... za... will... be...&quot; Jennifer slowly whistled as she closed her eyes. Leaving her almost passing out instantly the moment her head touched the pillow.</p>
