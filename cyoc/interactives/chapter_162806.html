<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;That was all entirely your fault.&quot; James said to Nicola walking away from the odd little store.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, she was cheating us out of our money. Didn&#39;t you see how empty the store was, and how full it was with stuff. No one&#39;s going to an old rink-a-dink shop in some back alley way. I don&#39;t even know why we were there in the first place.&quot; Nicola called back at James for accusing her of being too hard on the weird shop owner. They continued to walk out of the slightly dark and damp alley. The place was littered with trash. There was even a few homeless people, which a blanket man laying down cried out to James specifically. James stepped a few paces away in disgust<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, we already broke what may have been valuable item of hers, we could at least made a deal to help her with the cost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You actually believe a piece of junk like that was worth that many pounds? Again she&#39;s trying to con us to pay her for a priceless crystal ball, and the when she was rejected she just tried to put a curse on us like we were dumb enough to believe that horseshit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she was pretty crazy I&#39;ll give you that. Hopefully she doesn&#39;t press charges. Though I guess who could take a woman like that seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See, let&#39;s not worry about it, it&#39;s just swept under the rug. Anyway, we should head back to work, lunch break is almost over.&quot; James agreed and they eventually head out of the dank alley.<br />
<br />
They walked shoulder to shoulder on the side walk and it seemed most people went out of their way to go around them. At first they didn&#39;t even feel weird about that, though they witnessed some people look at them eyes wide. James stopped at one guy who as soon as he looked in his general direction he started to sweat bullets. James walked up to him with each step the man&#39;s clothes were getting soaked more and more. &quot;Uh, sir what are you staring at?&quot; James said while the man stuttered like a broken down engine. James didn&#39;t take any offense, in fact he found this guy to be pretty comical, he looked back at Nicola who seemed to find the situation to be funny. The guy eventually found his legs and walked backwards still looking at James in a weird way.<br />
<br />
James turned and as he did a mother and a little girl looked up at Nicola and pointed &quot;Horsey.&quot; Nicola looked at her confused. She looked at what she was wearing to see if there was a pin or something that had a horse, but there wasn&#39;t anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, I wonder why it&#39;s all alone.&quot; The mother turned to look at James who as soon as she saw him she gasped. &quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; She put her hands over the daughters eyes who wasn&#39;t even looking at James, but still looking at Nicola.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is wrong with you?!&quot; She screamed and then turned her kid around from James and then put her hands on her girl&#39;s ears. She called  James every name in the book before he could ask her what the problem was. James was more shocked to act out against her, but Nicola acted up instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the deal lady, what did he do wrong to make you act like a lunatic!&quot; She stood forward with her fist clenched and stood firm to hopefully have the woman to back off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that thing yours?&quot; The woman asked James. James looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; James looked confused at the lady.<br />
<br />
&quot;That horse, is it yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What horse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this some kind of joke to you?&quot; The horse right next to you. James looked back and forth and realized she was talking about Nicola.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you call me, bitch?&quot; Nicola now more furious than before bring out her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep your horse away from me and my daughter.&quot; She cried at James who now wanted to get Nicola to settle down.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it you&#39;re going to get it!&quot; Nicola growled and charged toward the woman who now had her daughter wrapped around her arms and they both began to scream. James was able to grab her left hand before she could hurt the woman. As soon as Nicola stopped the woman picked her child up in her arms and started to run and scream down the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s not worth it. Now we are late for work.&quot; James told Nicola still gripping her wrist tight. She loosened up and he decided to let go. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I hope I can talk to Mr. Waxman what held us up.&quot; She said as they continued down the sidewalk still seeing people act very strange around them. All they wanted now was to get back to work and not have to deal with anymore of what just happened.<br />
<br />
They get to their building and James opens the door for Nicola, &quot;After you.&quot; he said and she thanked him. They started to walk towards the elevator when they see the couple secretaries at the front desk fall over and hastily trying to get up. One walked up to them before they could get in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What seems to be the problem, ma&#39;am.&quot; He said. Not realizing he was addressing James they both looked at each other in total confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Gabe, it&#39;s us.&quot; Nicola said to the male secretary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this horse yours?&quot; He was pointing to Nicola and was addressing James.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gabe? What the hell?!?&quot; Nicola yelled though Gabe didn&#39;t give any attention to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you stopping us from going upstairs?&quot; James putting his hand on her waist to let her know he&#39;ll try to talk to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I ask why you would need to go upstairs?&quot; A question that seemed absolutely insane from both of them. They&#39;ve known Gabe ever since both of them came here. Why did he seem to not recognize them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you fooling around with us? I can&#39;t tell, you&#39;re never one to play a joke on us.&quot; James seemed ton get frustrated with this whole thing now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you I&#39;m trying to be as serious as I can. Now what do you mean by &#39;we?&#39;&quot; After this his was hard for James to not lose his cool, which he very rarely did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look Gabe, me and Nicola are late as it is can you please let us by.&quot; James then tried to move around him but Gabe still was able to push on in front of them. &quot;I&#39;m serious here we&#39;re late for work!&quot; James yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey settle down, no reason to get mad. I can&#39;t let you and, um Nicola was it, to go up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not!?&quot; Now both of them yell back at him. He put his finger in the front of his mouth to quiet them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can name several reasons. May I give them to you?&quot; He asked. They nodded. &quot;One is well, you&#39;re not exactly well dressed to come inside this building.&quot; He gestured to James who now took offense. &quot;Two, we have a no animal policy, especially yours.&quot; He gestured to Nicola who proceeded to cross her arms. &quot;And two we&#39;re not hiring anyone at the moment and I&#39;ve never met you before so there&#39;s that.&quot;<br />
Now both of them were equally fuming and it seemed that Gabe could feel their glare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then how did I know your name?&quot; James asked. Gabe pointed at his name badge which he always wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am, I&#39;ve got more work to do and I want to ask that you and your horse to walk out and I won&#39;t call security.&quot; James realized that he, like the lady from before, had called Nicola a horse, though he wondered why he addressed him as ma&#39;am. James went back to the shop keeper who told them of their curse. It couldn&#39;t be true though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what the fuck is going on here. Is everyone gone mad?&quot; Nicola screamed which now made Gabe turn and look at her. James pressed his hand at her waist again in hopes of her not starting a fight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry sir, we&#39;ll be leaving and sorry to trouble you. Though before we go, could I use your bathroom. I need to freshen up. Do you mind if I take my horse in as well?&quot; Nicola looked back at him with nothing but true rage. He pulled on her arm and hurried to the bathroom. He pushed open the woman&#39;s door in hopes that what he thought was true. When they got in, Nicola slapped him right across the cheek. It seemed that built up anger that Nicola felt was transferred with that slap.<br />
<br />
They both turned around and they couldn&#39;t believe what they were seeing. Instead of James looking at himself with clothes on his body the mirror told other wise. Instead he was completely naked for starters, which still would be horrible if it weren&#39;t for the fact that he was undeniably female. His mirror body&#39;s hair was a very golden yellow and it glistened when the lights shown on it. It flowed all the way to his waist. His breasts were much more larger in comparison to his own. They looked large and soft, he wasn&#39;t an expert on bra sizes, but he figured that his newly found breasts could barely fit in a DD size. His genitals were swapped for a vagina as well and it was completely shaved. His ass was small after seeing the size of his boobs, though he still looked sexy down there. The weirdest thing for him now was he was starting to get hard for his naked mirror self. For Nicola it was more forward and worse. She was a white stallion with a saddle displayed across her back. She looked about a foot taller than he did, and about 6 inches more from his reflection. As she walked on her legs the horse&#39;s four legs walked. Nothing even happen when she raised her hands or arms. They both looked at their reflections with utter shock not knowing what they need to do to undo this curse.</p>
