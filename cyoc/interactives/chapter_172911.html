<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Kevin, will be back in a hour.” Kevin&#39;s mother said before she and her husband left their home.<br />
<br />
Kevin was 14 years old, he can take care of himself for an hour and with that terrible pandemic outside, he preferred to stay at home and play some videogames. So, when he realized he was alone, he ran to his bedroom and turned on his PC.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m in the mood for some ranked battles.” He thought before he started to play. Since the pandemic started, he and his friends use to play more frequently than before. Also, it was a good way to know what happen outside his house.<br />
<br />
“Did you hear it?” One of Kevin&#39;s friend said. “Yesterday, a bunch of infected guys invaded the school. They&#39;re protesting for better job opportunities and stuff.”<br />
<br />
“It must be very difficult to find a job when people don&#39;t want to be near to you.” Another of Kevin&#39;s friend said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but I heard that infected people develop their memory as well as their bodies. So, they&#39;re technically capable of doing grown-up things.” Kevin replied. “It&#39;s not that bad.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Kev. Are you implying that you want to be infected?”<br />
<br />
“No, no, no. I&#39;m fine. Thanks.” Kevin quickly answered. “It&#39;s just that, well, they don&#39;t have a terrible life. They shouldn&#39;t protest like that. I mean, I hadn&#39;t seen a single infected guy on TV that didn&#39;t look gorgeous. They&#39;re like movie stars!”<br />
<br />
“Or porn stars! Hahaha!” One of Kevin&#39;s friends said and everyone bursted into laughter.<br />
<br />
Kevin was laughing as well when he felt a sudden itching all over his body. It was getting so intense so fast, that he stopped playing and began to scratch himself.<br />
<br />
“Kev, are you ok? Why did you stop playing?” Someone asked him.<br />
<br />
“I, I feel... itchy.” Kevin said as he removed his t-shir. Just then he felt his heart starting to pound rapidly, he was breathing with difficulty. “Ah! Uh! Uhh!”<br />
<br />
“Those symptoms...” One of the boys said to the others. “Don&#39;t you think he is infected?”<br />
<br />
“Quick, Kevin! Turn your camera on!! I want to see it!!”<br />
<br />
Kevin didn&#39;t know why he obeyed but he turned his computer camera on, so his friends could see him growing up. They immediately noticed that Kevin was getting taller so fast until he was about 6&#39;4&quot;.<br />
<br />
“Wow, he&#39;s got tall!” Kevin heard as his heart began to slow down. He can feel that his pants were very tight now and barely went down to the middle of his calf. His size 9 shoes were hurting so much now.<br />
<br />
“Kev, were you always so hairy?” One of his friends asked him. “I can smell your musk through the screen! Hahaha!”<br />
<br />
“Shut up! It itches like hell!” Kevin shouted as he noticed that his voice had suddenly deepened. He didn&#39;t sound like a preteen at all anymore. Just then his heart started to pound again, but this time he started to sweat all over.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, uuuh!! Ah!” Kevin yelled as his body expanded and grew with tons of muscle. The musky sweat mixing with his thickening body hair made a fascinating sight for those kids looking through the camera. For a moment, all they can see was Kevin&#39;s large muscular torso totally exposed.<br />
<br />
Kevin was breathing heavy as his large pecs moved up and down. His biceps were now very large and muscular as well. His body began to stretch rapidly again. He grew to the size of 6&#39;9&quot;. His pants were up to his knees now and showing signs of strain. His legs began to thicken, calfs began to widen and thighs began get more muscular. Due to this rapid growth his pants started to shred clean off his body.<br />
<br />
“Uh! Ahh! Ugh!” Was all Kevin could say as his pants shredded and bursted open. His shoes suddenly busted right open revealing large size 16 feet in their place. He felt some relief from his tight shoes once they were no more. His pants and shoes were now shredded on the floor around him. His huge manly body was now exposed on camera with a thick coat of hair and sweat all over Kevin.<br />
<br />
He clenched his face as it rapidly matured through 16 years of testosterone. All that was left of his clothing were his now very tight briefs. Kevin could feel a tingling starting to form inside his underwear and suddenly he felt his butt pushing out from underneath him. His butt busted through his tight underwear exposing a now thick, muscular and large ass in its place.<br />
<br />
“Ahhhh!! Oooh!! Ugh!” Suddenly the tingling intensified as his balls dropped and inflated, his dick lengthened and hardened. His dick formed a big tent in his undies as it began to thicken. Alex looked down and suddenly saw his dick bust out of his underwear exposing large hairy balls and a throbbing hard large dick.<br />
<br />
“Wooow! You weren&#39;t lying about that porn star thing! It&#39;s colossal!!” Kevin heard as he tried to keep in balance with the pendulous thing between his thighs. He sheepishly tried to turn his camera off but instead he just gave his friends a close up to his new schlong. Before he can turn his PC off, he felt an intense but pleasant feeling moving through his throbbing dick.<br />
<br />
“AH!! UH! OH UGH!!!” Kevin screamed from all the pleasure he was feeling. Just then he dick let out large amounts of semen all on his chest and his computer before he passed out from all the growth and new orgasmic pleasure.<br />
<br />
“I guess he won&#39;t play another match...” One of Kevin&#39;s friends said as he watched the naked man through his screen.<br />
<br />
“G-guys... I feel... itchy.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, here we go again!”</p>
