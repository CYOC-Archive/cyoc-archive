<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Noe was already defeated, he knew his fate was sealed but still tried to fight it. Tried to hang on to himself, close his eyes and think of his past. Of his village hidden in the nearby woods, away from the monsters that would assimilate the denizens into their own kind. His mind moving to his two fathers, one a brave warrior and the other the towns medic. Thinking of his family and then his friends. The other boys of the village, and the guy who means the most to him. His own boyfriend, Denzel.<br />
<br />
Noe let out a moan, unsure of why until he looked down to his own body. His cock erect, pulsing at the mere thought of the man he loves. Tenting through the fabric of his pants, as the head of the family steps forward. The hobgoblin giving one more kiss to his husband, before looking to his soon to be son. Grabbing at his shirt and tearing it off, before lowering his muscled hand to his shorts and ripping them to pieces. Allowing Noe&#39;s cock to feel the cool air, and the hobgoblin to grin as he see&#39;s the stiff member.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s another human you care for, my son.&quot;<br />
Noe grunted, his feelings were changing by the second. Hearing the deep voice of his fath-. He shook his head, this &#39;hobgoblin&#39; was affecting him. He was wanting to listen, wanting to absorb all the knowledge that was being offered. As any good son should- no, he isn&#39;t this hobgoblins son. He&#39;s a human, his fathers are in the village!<br />
<br />
&quot;It is alright, my son. Your body is simply adapting. Expelling the humanity so you might be a proud hobgoblin. Follow your instincts, let it change you.&quot;<br />
Once more, Noe tried to ignore it. But he could resist no longer, his hand grasping his cock and starting to pump it. Immediately shooting a short burst of human spunk that lands on the stone ground. The head of his cock now taking on a red shade, his body inflating in size as his biology is altered. Noe hesitating for a moment before his new father speaks once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep going, we are proud of you.&quot;<br />
A dim grin spreads across Noe as he continues to jerk off. Shooting another load of human spunk as his body grows even further. Far broader than any of the other hobgoblins, undefined at current but starting to readjust after another load is fired. Arms filled with primal muscle, thick and covered in black hairs. Chest chiselled like a sculpture, meaty with wide shoulders. All covered in a forest of black hairs. His legs changing just as the rest of him does, gaining the needed bulk to carry his oversized form.<br />
<br />
His large hands continue to stroke his still human member. Though with another orgasm that does not last long, his cock growing a few inches before the red spreads down. Taking over from there and converting the rest of his body. Changing his skin to that same hue of his new family, before climbing to his head and adding the final touches. Pointing his ears, turning his eyes a bright orange, and filling his mouth with sharp teeth. The new hobgoblin feeling his now black hair growing longer by the second, a mane that is complemented by his wild beard. Body aging a few years to match the new form, as Noe feels his balls fill with hobgoblin spunk.<br />
<br />
Noe looks to the rest of his hobgoblin family, his first father having stepped away from him and returned to his second father. Wrapping an arm around his husband, Alex. The two watching their new son with pure pride. Meanwhile Ezra can barely contain his excitement, watching the impressive specimen that was made before charging forward into a hug. Barely able to wrap his arms around Noe&#39;s broad body.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel, bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
Noe chuckles, he feels great. Barely caring about the past he had lost, and looking forward to such a grand life ahead. Filled with a love for his family, and a desire to spread it further. Mind going back to his former village and how they would make good hobgoblins...as well as his desire to claim Denzel as his hobgoblin husband. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
He grunts, then lets out a deep and dim laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bro, feel great! Strong, sexy, perfect!&quot;<br />
Noe pats Ezra on the back, giving him a tight hug. Their parents approaching, the head of the house once more speaking.<br />
&quot;Something is on your mind still, Noe?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah dad, I know where a bunch of humans are!&quot;<br />
The hobgoblin smiles, Alex resting his head against his husband as he speaks.<br />
&quot;Even more children.&quot;<br />
The hobgoblin then nodding.<br />
&quot;Indeed, alongside new brothers for the two of us. A family is not made of just fathers and sons, but also uncles and grandfathers. We will have a legacy when we are finished with that village.&quot;<br />
<br />
The family shares a laugh, joint in purpose as Noe asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, bro. Can I ask a big favour?&quot;<br />
<br />
They all wait for him to continue, Noe smiling.<br />
&quot;Wanna go there first, had a boyfriend that I want to make my husband. That good?&quot;<br />
The leader nods.<br />
&quot;Of course, my son. Be sure to introduce the new hobgoblin to us after you are married!&quot;<br />
His husband smiling gently.<br />
&quot;Yes, we would love a son-in-law.&quot;<br />
With Ezra excitedly adding.<br />
&quot;Plus, I&#39;d just love more family!&quot;</p>
