<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At first, I thought this was a really great idea. I figured we would do this for z little while, and wait for the technology to catch up so we could switch back again. I didn&#39;t think it would be such a big deal. After all, my son is a handsome young boy, not quite a man. <br />
<br />
He had beautiful gray-green eyes, and light brown, almost dirty blond hair. He was still mostly hairless, and I never thought he was sexually active yet. Matter of fact, that never even crossed my mind. His body type was kind of close to mine, except that he is definitely male. And so, we went over to the clinic. <br />
<br />
The doctor went over the procedure, and had me and him sign a bunch of documents. We went into separate rooms, in order to get ready for the anasthesia that would put us under for the procedure. <br />
<br />
Before I knew it, the operation was over and I was waking up. While I admit I was mostly looking at the dollar signs rather than the implications, I was not actually prepared to wake up as my own 16 year old son. <br />
<br />
I slowly came to. Opened my eyes. It took a bit of effort to stay awake, while the grogginess slowly wore off. But I became more and more aware of my surroundings.<br />
<br />
&quot;His there, Mrs. Martin. Or rather, David as you will now be called from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;David.&quot; My name is now &quot;David.&quot; I looked down at my oddly small chest through the hospital gown I was wearing. I looked at my fingers. David&#39;s fingers! Long and thin. Perfect nails, even I was jealous of. A prominent vein in the right hand, that I was find of squeezing. A light dusting of hair on my new thin arms. Perfectly clear, smooth, tan skin. <br />
<br />
These were David&#39;s hands. His arms. His hair. His chest. I started hyperventilating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, this is normal. It&#39;ll get done getting used to your new body and new identity.&quot;<br />
<br />
I renember giving birth to this body! The teenage hands they used to be so tiny! <br />
<br />
Another person came in. Another doctor. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is Doctor Stevens. He is a therapist that will be working with you over the next couple of hours, to help you get acclimated to your new, very different, body.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, over the next few hours, I was introduced to my new body. Looking at my son&#39;s reflection in a mirror. Seeing his handsome features slightly reversed, knowing this was how he always saw himself. His gray-green eyes. His short, wavy blond hair. <br />
<br />
Eventually, we worked out way down to his.....my....new &quot;equipment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want me to give you a minute?&quot; Dr. Stevens asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um. Yeah. Sure,&quot; I said in David&#39;s teenaged boy&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
He stepped out, while I stood up and strode over to the bathroom. I looked over myself thoroughly. Nothing about this body was a me! <br />
<br />
I felt my warm, smooth, boyish body. I started feeling like a boy. My new penis started coming to life. My heart started to race. &quot;Oh no. Not that.&quot;  But I couldn&#39;t help myself. I started thinking about a girl in David&#39;s class, and how attractive I am now as a boy. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t.&quot; But I couldn&#39;t help it. I was becoming feverish, and that penis started tingling. I could feel the teenage boy hormones rising up. I actually felt my new balls begin churning, as my male equipment came to life. Before I knew it, I was ejaculating as my own teenage son!<br />
<br />
It took a few moments for the explosions to die down. I was breathing heavily, and was getting a little sweaty. Great. Boy sweat. Teenage boy sweat! I&#39;m still stuck as David!<br />
<br />
I had to clear my mind as much as possible, before looking for my new clothes. David&#39;s clothes. I found them in a bag in the closet. I stepped down, careful not to look at the male equipment attached to me.<br />
<br />
I opened the bag, and sighed. The familiar clothes he always wore, and what I washed countless times. I never imagined actually having to put these clothes on. I had to look down as I grabbed the dark blue boxer-briefs. David&#39;s penis was there, as I stepped foot into the briefs that haven&#39;t been washed since we got here. They are still clean, as he only wore them for a few hours. But it was still nerve-wracking, knowing I&#39;d be putting these clothes on as David. Whatever germs were on these clothes, are now mine I suppose. <br />
<br />
I pulled them up, and the penis made a nice, smooth, round bulge in the underwear that&#39;s now mine. I put on the rest of his skinny clothes, and turned towards a mirror, expecting to see myself. But all I saw was a reverse image of my handsome cute 16 year old boy! It was unexpected, despite my recent adventures. I guess this will have to be getting used to it.<br />
<br />
There came a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, come in,&quot; I said in my new unmistakable teenage boy voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. Now that you&#39;re changed and looking exactly like David, I need to talk to you about z slight....complication.....&quot;<br />
<br />
The doc had me sit down, as he gave me the disasterous news. David would now have to live the life of a fully grown donkey! Meanwhile, my old body is now dead, along with the donkey&#39;s mind. At least. Most of the donkey&#39;s mind....<br />
<br />
The doctor explained to me that he had to splice much of the original donkey&#39;s instincts from it&#39;s brain, with David&#39;s brain. Meaning, David will continue to have the intellectual capacity and memories of who he once was, but will now be controlled by donkey instincts. The doctor said he had to it, do that David could walk, eat, and properly express &quot;ITself&quot; in a social manner with other donkeys. <br />
<br />
After a lengthy conversation, and fits of anger, I told the doctor David will be living with us. With our money, I&#39;ll be buying a new house with plenty of land. <br />
<br />
I was taken in to see David the Donkey. Unfortunately, David will be stuck as purely a vegetarian on the bottom of the Anibal kingdom&#39;s food chain. His new body could never digest meat, or carbs, or dairy. It&#39;ll be mainly grains and grass for him. All this was explained to me, as I looked down at some random ass donkey still sleeping from the heavy doses of anasthesia they had to give him. At least they kept him on a bed with a pillow under his right cheek..<br />
<br />
I looked him over, unable to process that my boy&#39;s mind is now trapped inside the skull of this large 500 lb beast of burden. I looked at all four of his hooves, and cried. He has no hands, and never will have any. His future is bleak and quite limited. <br />
<br />
His ears were ridiculous. His teeth were heavily yellowed, almost green, and half rotting. His breath smelled bad. I pulled up the cover, and clearly saw he was very much male! Thick, yellowish Donkey seed will only be produced from such ample and hefty balls. <br />
<br />
He started waking up!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey David. Hi there honey,&quot; I said. He tried opening his eyes. He made a couple of unintelligable bray&#39;s. He was trying to move his left foreleg. Clearly struggling with his limited range of motion from that limb.<br />
<br />
He tried lifting his head, brayed s couple of more times, and passed out again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Also, he has the physiology of a donkey. Meaning, he will be physically unable to ever speak.&quot;</p>

I broke down in tears. What have I done!?</h3>
