<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tad&#39;s morning had been fairly calm as things went. He got up and went about handling his breakfast and overheard a bit of Claire and his mom&#39;s morning conversation. He was glad that his mother&#39;s first job interview seemed to go fairly well, though he was fairly certain that she had some other interviews coming up eventually and wasn&#39;t fully certain on how much time she would be given to make a final decision if things truly went well in terms of a job being offered. He recognized that that his mother couldn&#39;t live on his dad&#39;s pension forever and that she would need to find work, particularly while Tad was looking at going to college in the future. He hoped things went well for her.<br />
<br />
In this, Tad&#39;s morning was rather quiet and he simply went about his morning routine as it should be. He soon joined Amy as they boarded the bus, and she smiled to him as he sat down beside her while her brothers were nearby seated with a friend of theirs as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Tad said happily to Amy as he sat down beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Amy smiled back, &quot;how are things with your mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;her job interview yesterday went well... I think... and she seemed pleased with that. She and Claire were talking about that last night and this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Claire?&quot; Amy wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;She and my mom met at the Halloween Dance,&quot; Tad reminded his girlfriend, &quot;She asked my mom to turn her and they&#39;ve been something of an item ever since... remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Amy blinked and then nodded, &quot;Sorry... her name escaped me. They&#39;re doing well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So far as I can tell, they&#39;re happy, which is the important thing,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;and we&#39;ll mean that we&#39;ll have some peace and quiet for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And some fun on the weekend,&quot; Amy gave a knowing smile to which Tad heard Amy&#39;s younger brothers give their protests when they heard the tone of Amy&#39;s voice. It actually made both him and Amy chuckle a little bit as they rode the bus into school.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
However, some things soon became apparent to Tad that not everything was going to be quiet, as the school&#39;s rumor mill continued on at full speed. Moon Lake High had all the same potential signs of high school drama that any high school would have, and often the rumors and grumblings that Tad most often heard was in relation to those sorts of things. Who was popular and who was dating who and so on. It was something that was rather normal, and wouldn&#39;t be out of place at any of the other schools he&#39;d ever attended before his father&#39;s murder. However, Moon Lake High was different in that most of the students were weres of some kind. There some Moon Lake Normals that were in every class, or normal humans that were from new families and it was their parents or a sibling that became their family were, but they were in the distinct minority. Though, even they tended to be sympathetic to were issues, regardless of what the issue was.<br />
<br />
This sort of thing came into play during an English AP class. The class was supposed to be discussing and reviewing a piece of literature that they&#39;d had, and were divided up into groups to do so. However, he soon picked up some whispers from another group that made him look up. The source of the whispers were from a couple of other students who were in a group in the far corner of the classroom and far enough away from the teacher that the teacher wouldn&#39;t overhear them. Tad couldn&#39;t pay super close attention, but it sounded like there was some supposed talk about a special city council meeting being called for something... or it had already been had. He couldn&#39;t tell which, and this made Tad rather curious, but since he couldn&#39;t focus on the conversation, he couldn&#39;t come up with any thoughts on it. He simply continued on with his group and going over the assignment for the class period.<br />
<br />
However, that class wasn&#39;t the only place where he heard rumors like that. Later between classes after lunch, he overheard more such rumors in the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m telling you, Tina said, it&#39;s this Friday,&quot; he heard a female student say, &quot;her mom was cleaning one of the halls... or an adjoining room and overheard them making schedule for this special meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did she say WHAT this special meeting was for?&quot; a male voice answered, sounding rather skeptical.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it was something about a special presenter wanting to tell them a secret,&quot; the female voice answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A special presenter wants to tell the City Council a secret and that warrants a special meeting?&quot; the male voice countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can only tell you what Tina said her mom overheard,&quot; the female student answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;She must have misheard something,&quot; the male student countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, there IS a special meeting this Friday,&quot; the female student insisted.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Tad wasn&#39;t able to hear how that argument resolved as they went in one direction down the hall and he had to go another way down the hall. It sounded rather curious, and if he had the time, he might have tried to follow and find out what was going on, but he had his own classes and didn&#39;t have the time for that. Though he did find himself drifting as he knew a thing or two on how government/military entities tended to work, usually from what his father had explained to him in the past. Regularly scheduled meetings and routines were just that, routine. They were things to be expected and would generally handle rather routine business. However, special meetings would mean more as they would mean something new or something pressing had come up and that was what they were responding to. Knowing that left Tad wondering what this &quot;special meeting&quot; was about.<br />
<br />
However, Tad didn&#39;t really get a shot at an answer until after school got out for the day and he ran into Amy. He was happy to see her, as he always was. However, after overhearing some of the rumors during the course of the day, Tad was actually hoping that Amy had heard more and began to bring up the subject as they began their walk home.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... uh... did you hear anything going through the rumor mill today?&quot; Tad asked as they left the high school and were soon going down one of the streets toward the center of town.<br />
<br />
&quot;What sort of rumor?&quot; Amy asked back, &quot;there&#39;s always several that go around... one is that one of the weremer couples... I think they&#39;re freshmen... have had some drama going on in recent days, though I think that&#39;s one from the start of the week. There are some that relate to Ms. McCoy coming back, though some are grumbling that she&#39;s coming back and is too hard and some are actually that she and the guy she supposedly &quot;attacked&quot; if you caught the rumors on her from before Halloween, are engaged...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking more on this special city council meeting,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;I thought I heard something about it in AP English, but I couldn&#39;t be sure, and I overheard an actual conversation on it latter... Something about someone wanting to talk to the city council on Friday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did hear about that,&quot; Amy said nodding, &quot;supposedly it&#39;s something big, but their were no great details. By the time it actually got to me, I think it&#39;d gone through a few retellings, so I can&#39;t tell you entirely what it was about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad sighed and scuffed his feet for a moment. That was sort of the situation he&#39;d had too. There were some other &quot;rumblings&quot; about it that went on after he&#39;d heard the conversation in the hallway, but by that time it was like a game of telephone and the story seemed to change. One even reported that the special meeting had already happened. He&#39;d hoped that Amy might have either heard more or heard something different so the various rumors could be put together in what this special meeting on Friday was supposed to be about. It left Tad curious and that was about all that he had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I&#39;d think that whatever this meeting was about... it&#39;s something big,&quot; Amy commented after a moment, &quot;though... probably just a company that wants to either open an office in Moon Lake or something like that. My dad has said that sort of thing happens from time to time... Not often, but it does happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I&#39;d wonder why a special meeting on Friday would trigger so much in the way of the school&#39;s rumor mill,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;especially if it was only over a new business wanting to come to town.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded and they walked on, as neither had an answer as for what these rumors were about. There was curiosity, but that was about all Tad and Amy had at the moment.</p>
