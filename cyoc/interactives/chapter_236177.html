<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heiya Island was a beautiful spot to visit, and Codey Lightfoot looked out over much of the island with a degree of awe that he&#39;d never really had before. Most of his life had been spent in the quiet northeastern corner of Nevada in Lyre. He&#39;d grown up watching the various iterations of &quot;Power Rangers,&quot; and while he liked just about every series, the first series was always his favorite. It inspired him to learn martial arts, or at least act out the scenes from his favorite show and champion all that was good and just. He shared those same values with a brown pet rabbit that his parents bought him, and when Roger was uplifted, the two of them became brothers.<br />
<br />
Roger&#39;s uplifting proved to be a big benefit for him in other ways. For as Horizon began to find that the Animalia Virus could function as a cure for just about everything, it then brought in the Shikamatsu family. The parents were martial arts masters from various schools and after their pet rabbit, Yumi Usagi was uplifted, they became Animalians and set up their own dojo in Lyre, which Roger and Cody both signed up for. They learned a lot there and Codey dedicated himself firmly to the school, though as he went through high school, he also came to understand that the sort of martial arts heroics that he admired on television wasn&#39;t going to happen in real life, but by the time he graduated, he&#39;d accepted that, and while the recognition that Roger would ultimately move away to be with Jessica Mariana, he&#39;d also found love with Michiko Shikamatsu.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s amazing to come all this way for what would seem fairly normal back at home,&quot; Roger said to Codey as they stood at the front of podium that was set up in the conference room at the main hotel on Heiya Island.<br />
<br />
The room had been decorated in black and white, which fit the Domestic Rabbit breed that the Shikamatsu&#39;s were, and what Codey became after his first time with Michiko. There were black and white roses that were arranged in hearts that were mounted on the walls and some smaller ones that were situated on the chairs at the ends of the rows that filled the room. There were plenty of guests, though most were likely friends with the Shikamatsus. His family was there, and that included Roger, who stood by him as &quot;best man.&quot; Jessica had also come and was seated with the rest of the Lightfoots. There were a few others that were friends of his, and some of them were from his own time at college, but many couldn&#39;t make the journey from the US to Heiya Island. That was ultimately the thing that Roger pointed to, and Codey could consider it a bit odd since the Shikamatsus did live in Lyre/Animalia now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think some of it is that Michiko&#39;s parents wanted a location that would be more... like &quot;home&quot; for them,&quot; Codey commented, &quot;given that they came from Japan before moving to America. And the style... that&#39;s... well... more Michiko&#39;s style. More modern.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More western,&quot; Roger corrected, &quot;as I don&#39;t think a lot of this fits with any oriental custom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d be easier for mom and dad to understand, though,&quot; Codey shrugged, &quot;and it&#39;ll make Michiko happy, so that&#39;s all that matters to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger nodded with a smile to his adoptive brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how have you and Jessica been?&quot; Codey asked quietly, &quot;she get the part she was looking toward?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... and they&#39;re doing a lot of rehearsal work now,&quot; Roger answered, &quot;which means some zoom meetings and practice at odd hours while we&#39;re here... but you&#39;re still my brother. We&#39;ll always be there to support you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Codey smiled.<br />
<br />
It was then that the door at the far end of the room opened, and Michiko came in with her father escorting her. She wore a formal dark blue dress that typically one might associate with prom or some other formal party gathering rather than a wedding. But given the black and white coloration of Michiko&#39;s fur, there was the idea to not blend into the wedding dress. There were also some statements that were also there of &quot;being different.&quot; Regardless, the conversation with his brother was forgotten he watched Michiko make her way forward and with her father on her arm. Yumi followed along behind as Michiko&#39;s Maid of Honor. In some ways it reminded Codey on how similar his and Michiko&#39;s stories were. Both of them were born Human, both had their pet rabbits become Animalians, both saw their families adopt new Animalians into their respective families. The big difference was that Codey, and his family remained Human for a time, while the Shikamatsus essentially asked Yumi to convert them.<br />
<br />
Mr. Shikamatsu led Michiko up before Codey and patted her shoulder before moving to sit beside his wife. He nodded to both Codey and Roger and then continued on. Yumi then moved to stand behind Michiko. She waved politely to Roger and then to Jessica and let things settle down to where Ami could conduct the ceremony. Ami had stood quietly behind the podium and had gone over the instructions for a more modern style wedding. Given the heritage of the Shikamatsu family, there had been the wonder if a traditional Shinto wedding was going to be preferred and that a second Christian ceremony would be held for the Lightfoots, similar to how Nate and Shuixing had had their wedding conducted to accommodate Christian and Buddhist traditions. But it appeared that the wedding would be one simple and more western style ceremony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings all to the wedding of Lightfoot, Cody and Shikamatsu, Michiko,&quot; Ami spoke, &quot;I am pleased that so many guests and friends of the bride and groom, Human and Animalian have come to these ceremonies. I am especially happy to welcome those that have come all the way from the United States for these ceremonies. Hopefully, they provide everyone with happiness for the bride and groom.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few small claps that game from the gathered guests. Codey merely found himself smiling to Michiko. It was probably a rather dopey grin, but then, Codey also didn&#39;t care. He knew he was extraordinarily lucky to have found that Michiko liked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ceremony will not be long,&quot; Ami continued, &quot;and we will move to some prepared statements that young Mr. Lightfoot and Ms. Shikamatsu have prepared.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ami then looked over to Codey with a small nodded. Roger patted him on the back and Jessica gave him a thumbs up from her seat. Roger nodded and raised his had up to cover his mouth and give a small, forced cough to clear his throat. From there, he then began to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Michiko... I am so incredibly lucky that you came into my life,&quot; Codey spoke as he looked to her, watching her Lapine nose twitch with each breath she took, &quot;and it&#39;s not just because your father brought his martial arts skills to teach in Lyre/Animalia. It&#39;s been about so much more. I never expected you to have interest in me when I was Human... but you provided a lot of emotional comfort and confidence to me. Provided things that I never expected. Made me all the more willing and confident in becoming an Animalian to be with you. Your heart touched my heart and that made me happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Codey... you&#39;ve been my father&#39;s most dedicated student, even while you were Human,&quot; Michiko said back to him, a smile forming on her furry Lapine muzzle, &quot;but you&#39;ve also been so much more, even when you didn&#39;t know it. You were cute as a Human and now the most handsome Rabbit Animalian I know. You&#39;ve been kind and caring... loving to your family and friends. Respectful of me. You&#39;ve had all the qualities that anyone would want in a partner and husband. Never forget that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Codey mouthed the words &quot;I won&#39;t&quot; to her as Michiko continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in many ways... I&#39;m just as lucky to have found you,&quot; Michiko continued, &quot;people may have their jokes regarding your choices in television fandoms, but they may also face their own issues where others may have their own jokes. Television does not matter. What matters is where one is good and where their cause is... and you&#39;ve shown to stand for a good cause through studying under my father, respecting me, and being the kind and generous person you are. I would be happy to be your wife and bear your children. For I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Codey found himself saying as he moved forward and embraced Michiko, who hugged him back and nuzzled her muzzle to his. It took a little while, but they then backed out of the hug, but still held each other&#39;s hands as they then looked to Ami, who had stood by quietly as they exchanged their declarations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, do you, Shikamatsu, Michiko, take this Rabbit Animalian to be your lawfully wedded husband?&quot; Ami asked, &quot;for richer or for poorer? In sickness and in health? For as long as the two of you shall live?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Michiko answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And do you, Lightfoot, Codey, take this Rabbit Animalian to be your lawfully wedded wife?&quot; Ami asked, &quot;for richer or for poorer? In sickness and in health? For as long as the two of you shall live?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Codey answered with a firm but happy tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does anyone gathered have any just reason why these two should not be married?&quot; Ami then asked to the gathered crowd.<br />
<br />
No one in the audience said anything. Ami noted that there were several shakes of the head that said &quot;no&quot; to the question, and she took that as the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it is my pleasure as the elected leader of Heiya Island... and by the appropriate powers from Heiya Prefecture and Japanese law that these two are legally married,&quot; Ami spoke, &quot;and I would like to introduce you to Lightfoot, Codey and Michiko. You may kiss your spouse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With pleasure,&quot; Michiko said with glee and leaped into Codey&#39;s arms as the two then kissed. Codey kissed her back with his arms wrapped and the small of her back to hold her to him. And as the crowd cheered, the only thing that mattered to him was Michiko was now his wife and they were close together, and would be, forever more.</p>
