<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Looking at the three options on the screen, both guys could make separate decisions, but to keep it cheap, they would just stay ion the same room, no matter what was chosen. As Dean hesitated to make a choice, finding it odd that there was no price listed for any of the three rooms. Dean also didn't know which choice he wanted, because of the descriptions.</br>
<br><b>BEAR ROOM: </b><i>This room comes with all the amenities of home, a 65" Plasma screen television, complete with Bose Lifestyle 48 for your movie experience, a double king size down mattress, with a re-enforced frame. This is all inside a palatial space, made to make any bear feel like he was back home. The bathroom is a grand master bath, large enough to fit the biggest of bears, complete with: a double sink; an extra large, glass enclosed shower; and most important, a Flush Master 5000 toilet, the most high tech equipment you'll ever sit on.<b>*** Please note, this room is for MALES ONLY***</b></i></br>
<br><b>WOLF ROOM: </b><i>Tired from a long journey? Come and relax in your private den, perfect for every wolf among us. This room is much like the BEAR ROOM, but it caters to the size and needs of the wolf in all of us.</i></br>
<br><b>DOG ROOM: </b><i>Come and spend some quality time here, where you can enjoy the dog inside of you. This room is standard, with a television, king size bed, complete with all kinds of treats and snacks that would please any dog!</i></br>
<br>Even though they wanted to save money, the BEAR ROOM sounded the best, especially since they knew that bears lived comfortably, knowing how to relax when the time came. It was probably going to be super expensive, but they figured it was probably going to be worth it, not to mention the only time they would be able to afford such accommodations. Dean and Sam looked at each other, knowing what the other was thinking, and clicked accept on the BEAR ROOM</br>
<br>The screen went black for a few seconds, while it processed the request, then a screen popped up that said <i>Please enjoy your stay. Each person who will be in the room, please place your index finger on the black metal box to the left of the monitor.</i></br>
<br>Curious as to what this was for, Sam and Dean took turns. When Sam placed his index finger on the box, he felt a small pin prick. It wasn't a painful one where he would normally recoil his hand back in disdain for the discomfort. Dean proceeded to do what Sam had. They watched the computer as it said <i>Analyzing</i> and in a few seconds it was done. Now on the screen was a split screen view. On the top it displayed all of Sam's bio-statistics as well as his photo from the department of motor vehicles (A.K.A. The DMV). Below Sam's was Dean's info, including his photo. Suddenly the screen flickered again, displaying: <i>Analysis complete, please proceed into the open elevator. When you get to your room, please enter one at a time, placing your scanned index finger on the scanning device. The service is completely automated here and no keys are made. You are your own key, that way there is no trouble gaining access, unless of course you lose your hand or yourself. Enjoy your stay at Animal Hotel.</i> The screen went pitch black and the computer turned itself off.</br>
<br>Seconds after the whir of the computer turning off, there was a ding, signaling the elevator was ready to transport. Sam and Dean looked at each other, shrugged then walked into the elevator. The doors closed silently behind them. Sam and Dean stood there, not saying a word to one another, but when Sam was about to say something, the elevator stopped, chimed and opened the doors. As they stepped out of the car, they looked around at their surroundings. There were only three doors; one to their right, left and in front of them. The door on the left was labeled DOG, to their right was WOLF and directly in front was BEAR. Happy that there was not far to walk, unlike most places they have stayed before, they proceeded to the door. To the right of the frame was another metal box and a touch screen above it, at eye level. Sam tapped the screen, hoping there were some more efficient instructions and was happy with the result. The screen said: <i>Welcome to the BEAR ROOM, we do hope you will enjoy your stay. Please place your scanned index finger on the pad below in the order you were scanned. Once all parties have been identified, the door will release and you will be able to enter.</i>Sam did as was instructed, then Dean and as the computer posted, the door opened revealing the room.</br>
<br>Sam and Dean walked into the room and were amazed by it. It was the total epidimy of a bear paradise. The room itself was a large and very spacious faux cave, the television was against the front wall, mounted directly to it, the large bed was against the back wall and positioned right in front of the television. There was other furniture in the room, like a few dressers, a couple of tables with a single standing lamp for each, one on each side of the bed, but weirdest of all about the room was that there was no phone.</br>
<br>Sam walked over to the dresser as Dean went about looking for whatever the room control device would be.</br>
<br>"Hey Sam, I wonder how we control everything especially this awesome tv."</br>
<br>Almost right after Dean finished speaking aloud, there was a deep and manly voice that came from no where. "Hello and welcome to the BEAR ROOM. I am your helpful and needed device, or H.A.N.K. for short."</br>
<br>Sam stopped before he opened the drawer, fascinated by the room, more so than he had when they just walked into the hotel. "Alright Hank, tell me, what can you do?"</br>
<br>"That is a good question Sam... and I know what you are thinking, how can I know your name? I know everything about the both of you, this is why we had you scanned. This is so that I can provide everything your tastes call for. For instance, I know that both of you are gay.</br>
<br>Sam and Dean simultaneously piped up. "Hey! Neither of us are like that, ok BUD?"</br>
<br>"Oh is that so, well I guess I will have to prove it, then we can move on."</br>
<br>Before either of them could say anything, a man six feet-three inches tall stood before them at the foot of the bed. He stood there, completely naked, allowing the guys to see every detail. He was very muscular, with slight padding of fat on each muscle to soften it, instead of the hard solid muscle bodybuilders enjoyed so much. He had somewhat of a dark complexion, more of a golden tan, but augmented slightly to be slightly darker toward brown, but lightened at the same time not to be too dark. His face was manly, chiseled from what they could tell through the full dark brown beard he sported. His powerful hands, forearms, voluptuous pecs, slight tire of a gut, mid thighs, legs and feet were all covered in a dense dark brown fur, but shaved to be hairy but groomed. His cock and balls were free of hair, but they were definitely manly as his size was impressive. His cock had a nicely shaped mushroom head that was an inch and a quarter deep and as girthy as his whole cock. His length was a modest seven inches, but his girth was at least the size of a beer can, which was also his mushroom head. The two stood there jaw dropped, unbelieving what they saw and how they both felt. The man walked up closer to them and they could see his cock head spewing out copious amounts of pre, pooling on the ground below. Both guys stood there, eying the mega cock, not really knowing what to do, especially trying to hold back what both had been trying so hard to conceal.</br>
<br>The bear man spoke and it was Hank's voice. "So if you two aren't gay, why do I see that your crotches are bulging, you are eying my cock and your pheromones are up? All these things would suggest that you are both indeed gay."</br>
<br>Frustrated by the machine's outing, they both spoke simultaneously "Yes, I am gay!"</br>
<br>Dean and Sam looked at each other and smiled, happy that they were still the same and they could be truthful to themselves. No longer would Dean have o act like a womanizer. When they both looked at Hank, he was smiling his bearish smile.</br>
<br>Just as quickly as he appeared, he disappeared and began speaking. "Now that all of this is settled, you can see how I can provide for your tastes in one way. There are many others, like keeping the air temperature perfect, I can materialize anything you would like to eat and/or drink, I can also materialize any item you may want to own as long as it can be found through the Internet. I can create sex toys, lubricant or whatever else should the need occur. Another thing you both should be aware of is that this room is yours. You are not renting for the night, you are owning for the rest of your lives as long as that might be. Another convenience is you are allowed to go to the BEAR BAR across the way, on the ground level and drink there for free. The drinking age on Pleasure Island is eighteen, and since you both recently turned eighteen, there is no need for physical augmentation to meet that requirement. Do you have any questions for me?"</br>
<br>"Yes, I do again. Why is the room ours from this point on and when you just popped out like you did a few moments ago, were you corporeal or transient?"</br>
<br>"Both are good questions and I can tell you are definitely into technology. When you both had your bio-signitures scanned, it was downloaded into my software here, I became active and the knowledge was then hard-written into my database, and it cannot be deleted. This island caters to every individual, no matter how boring or wild that might be and because of this, no one can either use me as their room-companion or even enter the room to try. I am now linked to your specifics until you die, which if that occurs, I self destruct and another is built in my place. the answer to your second question is, when I popped up as you called it, I was corporeal. Before you ask how, I can use the IMD or Internal Materialization Device to create a solid form to suit whatever needs the users of this room may want. Now it is my turn to ask you a question. What would you like to do now?"</br></p>
