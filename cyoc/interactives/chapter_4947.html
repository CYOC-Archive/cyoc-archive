<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jamie began to kiss Kylie once again.  Kylie felt herself being lost in Jamie's lips.  Kylie lowered herself flat onto the bed.  Jamie, not wanting to part lips with her, lowered herself in accord.  Kylie continued to make out with Jamie passionately.  While they kissed Kylie, reached her hands down and unbuttoned the pair of jeans that she was wearing.  Jamie didn't notice as all of her attention was on Kylie's face.  She caressed Kylie's soft cheeks with her hands while her tongue explored Kylie's mouth.<br />
<br />
Kylie suddenly sat up, ending the moment.  &quot;Wait, wait, wait,&quot; she pleaded.  A look of disappointment ran over Jamie's face.  &quot;What's wrong?&quot; she asked.  Kylie said, &quot;Think.  It's fine for us that we know how we feel.  What about everyone else?&quot;  Jamie smiled and said, &quot;Let them think whatever they want,&quot; and she leaned back into Kylie's face, hoping to resume their kissing.<br />
<br />
Kylie stopped her, though.  She was troubled.  &quot;I don't care about the general public.  That's not what I mean.  What about the people who care for us?  Our friends; Jenn, Liz &amp; Trish; jeez, our parents especially.  How are they going to take this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie thought for a moment.  &quot;Yea, you're right.  I was too caught up to think about that.&quot;  She pondered again.  Kylie seemed to stop thinking, as she waited for a cue from Jamie.  &quot;Oh God, we're being so stupid, Kylie.&quot;  Kylie was taken aback.  She thought that Jamie meant their actions were stupid.  Jamie contradicted her though, as she said, &quot;We have this fun little curse to use.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Kylie protested, &quot;But I gave it back to Jenn.  I can't use it.&quot;  Jamie said, &quot;Who's to say another can't be started?  Did someone do it to Kyle before he called Jenn?&quot;  Kylie replied, &quot;No, Miranda bascially forced him to do it on his own.&quot;  &quot;Then there's our answer,&quot; Jamie said.  &quot;We start one of our own.  And let's agree to keep it just between us.  No passing it to anyone else unless we both agree.  That's probably for the best.&quot;  Kylie agreed, &quot;OK.  So how do we do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both thought about how they should go about insuring no one would infringe upon the happiness they were sure they had found.  Jamie admired Kylie for remembering something like that in a moment of passion.  She knew that she wouldn't have been able to, as she thought back to the time she had unprotected sex with her second boyfriend.  Luckily he didn't have any kind of STD, and she didn't get pregnant.  She did make sure that she remembered the two times after that.<br />
<br />
Kylie was impressed with the quick wits that Jamie showed once again.  She simply would not have thought to use the curse, for whatever reason.  Kyle had been fairly intelligent, she reasoned, but was a little slower when it came to common sense and quick decision making.  That was something else she'd have to improve as she became her own person, she decided.<br />
<br />
Just then, Jamie said, &quot;I've got it!&quot;  Kylie looked at her eagerly.  &quot;I'll start it.  You pick Dare, and when I'm done, you say it exactly the same back to me.  Here we go.  Transform or Dare?&quot;  Kylie smiled as she answered, &quot;Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie spoke the words.  &quot;This is going to be long, so get ready.  Kylie, I dare you to be in a sexual, caring, nurturing, lesbian relationship with me, until there ever comes a time when we both agree to break up, that no one on Earth will ridicule, scorn, persecute or belittle us for; that our closest friends, especially Jenn, Trish &amp; Liz, will be comfortable with; that no one will think is abnormal in any way; and that both of our parents will be totally acceptable of, will love the other as a daughter, will get along with each other's parents, will say to other people that they'd rather see us be happy to anyone who might question them about it, and lastly, will not mind that we spend the night at each other's house for any purpose, be it to study or to have sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie was amazed at the length.  She silently prayed that it would go into effect exactly as Jamie worded it.  &quot;OK,&quot; Jamie said, &quot;now give it back to me.&quot;  Kylie did so, copying exactly what Jamie said down to the last word.  Both now felt a wave of comfort wash over them.  They felt at ease and secure with what they were going to do.  Neither could deny how they felt about the other, and they were determined not to let someone else tear them apart now, unless somewhere down the line they decided to break away from each other.  But that was not now.  Nor did they hope it would be anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Kylie said, &quot;I think we still both need to be honest and tell our parents.&quot;  Jamie agreed, &quot;Yea, dare or no dare, I'd like to be up front about it, too.&quot;  There was one thing Kylie had to know.  &quot;Jamie, is this love?&quot;  Jamie wasn't sure what to say.  She spoke what she felt.  &quot;I don't know, Kylie.  It could be.  I've never been in love before.  But I also know I've never felt quite like this either.  We're going to have to figure it out as we go along.&quot;  Kylie nodded in agreement.  She felt the same way.  It could be love she was feeling for Jamie, but she was never sure what that felt like.<br />
<br />
Jamie said, &quot;That's done.  Now where were we?&quot;  Kylie giggled and said, &quot;I think right about here.&quot;  She laid back down on the bed, and told Jamie with her finger to come join her.  Jamie said, &quot;Ooh, are you going to be the dominant one?&quot;  Kylie said, &quot;Who cares about that now?  Just come here and make me feel good again.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all the invitation Jamie needed.  She laid back down on top of Kylie, and planted another firm kiss on her lips.  While she kissed her, she slipped both shoes off her feet by giving each a tug with the opposite foot.  She could hear Kylie do the same with her shoes.  She broke away once more, this time to remove her socks.  Kylie sat up and did the same.  Jamie was prepared to resume kissing Kylie, but she saw that Kylie was starting to unzip her jeans now.<br />
<br />
Jamie wanted to make Kylie feel the way she had earlier in the afternoon.  She unbuttoned her shirt, a green woolen, and slipped it off her shoulders.  She was wearing a plain white bra, which showed off her ample cleavage quite nicely.  She tossed her shirt aside and unbuttoned her own jeans.  She bent over Kylie's waiting body once more, and pulled the jeans off Kylie's legs from where she had gotten them to.  She sensed that Kylie was also anxious for a repeat of the afternoon's action. <br />
<br />
Her hands slid their way up Kylie's smooth legs.  Kylie grew wet with anticipation.  Jamie's hands reached Kylie's panties.  They gave the panties a tug, pulling them off Kylie's body.  Kylie lifted herself up in the air to help with their removal.  Jamie slid them the rest of the way off her legs and threw them off the bed.  Her hands now started to touch her own body.  Kylie's attention was drawn to them as Jamie began running her fingers over her flat stomach.  She lifted her hands up to her bra, and in one firm movement, grabbed the bra and yanked it right over her breasts and over her head.  <br />
<br />
The cool air of the room made stiffened her nipples immediately.  She bent back down to Kylie's eagerly awaiting body.  She kissed her thighs, slowly moving her head closer to Kylie's anticipating pussy.  She moved her head over Kylie's pussy and began to go to work.  Kylie had been waiting for it so much that she put her hand on Jamie's head, pushing her down closer so there could be no doubt what Kylie wanted done.  Jamie was happy to oblige.<br />
<br />
While taking her own hand and removing Kylie's from her head, she opened her mouth wide and extended her tongue in search of Kylie's slit.  She found it with relative ease thanks to her exploration in the afternoon.  Kylie moaned loudly when she felt Jamie's tongue inside of her.  Jamie slid her tongue in and out of Kylie's pussy, building her up slowly.  Kylie was becoming so turned on that she began to massage her breasts.  Her shirt was restricting her from getting satisfaction out of doing this.  She ripped her shirt off, and did the same to her bra.  She played with her nipples, doing everything she could to maximize her pleasure.  <br />
<br />
Jamie continued to explore Kylie's pussy.  She moved her tongue all around, until she was sure that she had found Kylie's clit.  She focused her tongue totally on it, protruding it with every area of her tongue that could touch it.  Kylie's moans grew louder.  Jamie put reached her hand up over Kylie's mouth.  She didn't want to wake her parents.  Kylie got the hint and did her best to stifle the moans.  It was becoming impossible though since Jamie was doing such a good job stimulating her clit.  Jamie now backed her tongue out of Kylie's slit once again, and resumed thrusting it in and out, making sure that she found Kylie's clit each time her tongue went in.  It took only a few thrusts of this kind for Kylie to explode with orgasm.  Jamie lapped up all the juices that began to flow out of Kylie's pussy.  Kylie continued to massage her breasts as Jamie finished licking her pussy.  <br />
<br />
Jamie lifted her head from between Kylie's legs and got off the bed.  She inserted her thumbs under the waistbands of her jeans and thongs, and pulled them off revealing her glorious pussy and ass.  She kicked them aside and climbed back on top of Kylie's naked body.  She kissed Kylie's breasts, sucking them gently as she did.  Jamie moved her head even with Kylie's and began to kiss her lips once more.  Kylie noticed a strange taste to Jamie's mouth.  She realized that the essence of her juices were still on Jamie's lips, and now she was getting a full taste of it.  She decided she wanted more. <br />
<br />
Kylie grabbed Jamie's back around, and spun her around to lay flat on the bed.  &quot;Allow me to return the favor,&quot; she said.  Jamie smiled with delight and said &quot;Please do.&quot;  Kylie began to explore Jamie's pussy in the same way.  She used her fingers to get Jamie stimulatd first.  Taking two fingers on her left hand, she inserted them slowly into Jamie's slit.  Jamie began to moan wildly, as Liz's fingers had not been that gentle in the afternoon.  When Kylie felt that Jamie was stimulated enough, she bent her head down and proceeded to use her tongue to finish the job.  Jamie came after a couple of minutes.<br />
<br />
Exhausted, Kylie collapsed on the bed next to Jamie.  Kylie laid sideways and reached her right hand across to rest on Jamie's breast.  She rubbed it up and down while Jamie placed her hand on top of Kylie's to help guide it.  Kylie admitted, &quot;I want to do more.&quot;  Jamie laughed and said, &quot;I do too.  But...I'm just too tired.&quot;  Kylie agreed, &quot;Me too.&quot;  Jamie reached her right arm down to stroke Kylie's hair.  Then she placed it underneath Kylie's body.  Kylie snuggled in closer to her.  They laid there for a few minutes, each staring off into space; Jaime at the ceiling, and Kylie over Jamie's body to the wall.  <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Kylie asked &quot;So now what?&quot;  Jamie exhaled loudly.  &quot;We're going to have to tell your parents tomorrow morning.  There's no sense in denying this.  When will they leave for work?&quot;  &quot;Around 7:30,&quot; Kylie answered.  &quot;They always make sure they get up early enough to sit down and eat breakfast, though.&quot;  Jamie planned, &quot;Let's make sure we get up to tell them then.&quot;  Kylie lifted herself off the bed, and reached over to set her alarm clock for 6.  She laid back down and wrapped her arms around Jamie's torso.  She smiled and closed her eyes.  Jamie placed her arm back under Kylie's head and neck.  She grabbed the blankets, which had been torn down the bed by their sexual activity, and pulled them back over top of her and Kylie.  She reached up and turned off the light above her head, and closed her eyes.  They fell asleep in their lover's arms.</p>
