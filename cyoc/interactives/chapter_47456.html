<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake was still in a state of shock at the attractiveness of the girl’s stolen body. “That’s weird, I wonder, if she touched the stuff too, if she’s like him…” He muttered to himself as he walked down the steps of the guesthouse. Jake had locked Will in and put the security alarm on, it was a small little thing that would help Will out in case he needed a few extra seconds to hide. He was so turned on by the sight that he didn’t even give his friend any decent goodnight. “Too hot…have to build up some tolerance before I can stick around him for too long. I mean…those puppy dog eyes…” He shivered, even the thought made him melt. Quietly Jake entered his house from the back door, making sure not to make a peep as he did. He engaged the security alarm to the house as well.<br />
<br />
Looking around for a moment or two to make sure that Debbie was asleep, Jake tiptoed over to his study. He saw his German Shepherd, Maxine, whom was a pretty laid-back guard dog by any standard. “Shh…Maxine, it’s just me…daddy…” Her tail gently wagged back and forth as she recognized him, he patted her on the head as he walked by, she followed loyally behind him.  Walking into the study, he immediately closed the door behind him and the dog, he flipped the light on. “Ok, time to see what the hell this thing is all about.&quot; As he took the bottle out of his pocket, setting it down on the desk, he took his jacket off. Jake turned the computer on, taking a seat at the same time. It didn’t take very long before he was on the internet, typing in the words that he read off the side bottle. <br />
<br />
It actually took a moment or two to find anything, the language turned out to be a lost language that hadn’t been used in thousands of years. “Huh, dead language…that’s just a little weird, but that's gotta mean something…” He read for about twenty minutes and finally found the answers he was looking for it simply read out like instructions. “Love Enhancer. Two-Three drops applied to desired areas of the body will enhance them greatly. Avoid contact with anyone/anything for two minutes-MUST. 4-5 Drops will have a more overall effect on the body, causes a slight increase in sexual desire. Avoid contact for at least two minutes-MUST. Caution!- Do not ingest, will cause undesired affects upon the ingestie.”<br />
<br />
“Well, obviously Will touched the girl and that’s why it says no contact…sheesh, this should be in English.” Jake said, pressing the print button so he could have an English copy of the instructions. “Okay, so…it doesn’t say how to get Will back, we’ll still need to go to the shop for that…” He picked up the bottle cautiously, studying it, it was still a little over &frac34; full. “At least he didn’t waste it all.” He looked at Maxine. “Go lay down!” He ordered, the dog’s ear’s drooped as it went to it’s own bed in the corner of the office. “Last thing I need is a dog pussy…” He chuckled at the thought…shuttering a second later, thinking that it did say ‘anything’, it actually scared him a little. <br />
<br />
	Standing, Jake smirked, “What the hell, sounds like fun…” He unbuttoned his jeans, pulling them down along with his boxers. He was an average size man, but he definitely knew how to use what he was given and had never disappointed a girl. But he’d always wanted to have a beefier cock. Pulling out the stopper of the bottle, he took a quick whiff of the contents, it smelt pleasant, he took a deep breath. “Okay, just a few drops…” He tipped it gently, angling himself back as the liquid dropped onto the base of his shaft, he’d attempted to only do three, but another managed to drop out. He put the bottle back down on the desk. He rubbed in the oily-like substance over the entirety of his cock as it extended to it’s normal sized of 5”, the oil seemed to be more than a few drops as it encompassed his balls and shaft easily.<br />
<br />
	Jake stood naked from the waist down, he looked at the time, it was almost two minutes and nothing had happened yet. “What a hoax, that can’t be Will up there, I’m gonna kill that little broa…” He felt a strange tingle spreading through his body, the liquid seemingly absorbed right before his eyes. His whole body trembled, his heart pumped out his chest as he struggled to breathe, he felt his body increases in mass, his muscles seemed to tighten and become stronger than before, his arms thickening. His height increased by two inches, while between his legs, his member shot up to 9” and his balls swelled. Every muscle seemed to ripple as he regained control of his body. “Holy shit.” His voice was only slightly different, but when it’s yours you can notice. Jake walked over to the mirror, stripping off the remainder of his clothes. He saw a man, very muscular and handsome with a stunned expression on his face.<br />
<br />
	“I can’t believe it!” Jake said ecstatically, he looked down, every muscle was defined perfectly. His hands rested on the new member between his legs. “Phenomenal!” He stroked it slightly as it grew to full size, he would’ve wanted more, but it was great for now and better anyway. His body had a tanned appearance more than before the change. Jake’s smile turned into a devilish smirk, he opened the door to the study, not bothering to redress himself. Jake seemed like he was stronger than ever and running up the stairs toward their bedroom. Jake came running into the slightly opened door to their bedroom. His body was so full of energy, he could hardly wait to show Debbie his new appendage.<br />
<br />
	Debbie didn’t stir as Jake approached the bed, he tried to be quiet now, not wanting any objections. She usually found it sexy when he’d wake her up for some action, but it had been a while since that had happened. Debbie was sleeping on her back as he pulled the covers gently away, the light from the hall giving him a perfect view of her sleeping body. She wore only a pair of pink silk panties and a white cotton nightshirt. Jake smiled smiled, leaning down, his fingers gently grasping the waistband of her panties, he chuckled quietly that this was not the only girl’s panties he’d removed this evening and the other one was his best friend. She shifted slightly which gave Jake the opportunity to remove the panties completely, she was still sound asleep. <br />
<br />
	Lifting the shirt so her midriff was exposed, Jake pulled her legs up at the knee, spreading her eagle. Without missing a moment as she groaned slightly, Jake’s lowered his head to her trimmed pussy. He kissed her pussy lips before his tongue snaked out of his mouth. Soon Debbie began to smile, not fully aware yet, just from the pleasure as the warm tingle of excitement crawled through her. With each stroke of Jake’s tongue, Debbie’s pleasure would increase, quietly she was groaning in pleasure, unable to believe how good this all felt for just a dream. Jake could see her beginning to wriggle around, she was even biting her lower lip now to stop her moaning. Seeing her tension was building, he briefly stopped, causing Debbie’s eye’s to shoot wide open from the abruptly ending of her pleasure.<br />
<br />
	“Oh…Jake…wh…” Debbie was interrupted by Jake suddenly lunging forward, she gasped excitedly, smiling. “What’s got you so worked up?” Jake smirked. “How ‘bout I just show you?” He leaned forward, kissing her passionately, her legs slowly coiling around him, pulling him closer to her. Jake positioned himself and slowly inserted his new and improved member into her waiting pussy. His hands reached under the fabric of her shirt, playfully massaging them, they were perky AA-cups, but he loved them anyway, but a small part of him wanted to see them bigger though. “Later…” Pumping in and out of her, she gasped unlike she’d ever done in the past, a look of pleasured confusion struck her face. Jake could only smile down at his fianc&eacute; as she moaned her delight for the house to hear.</p>
