<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fear and a inner feeling of anxious longing for something but he just didn't yet know what made Bob run. After some time he at last felt far enough away from Madame's influence that he could stop and rest.<br />
<br />
Stopping he then dropped to his knees hands on hips he panted for breaths till his sense returned. A quick look around had him wonder how far he did run as it nolonger looked like the Isle of Pleasures but instead more like a western Kansas movie set.<br />
<br />
A group of poorly painted and weather beaten buildings were surrounded by small barns and many pens made for animals. A railroad track and siding ran along pens made for the loading of animals and a water tower looking straight out of the 1890's.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he had a real thirst and looked for some place to get that drink. The large barn marked Stables had what looked like a handy watering tough. At first he shuddered to think of all the animals who dunked their lips into the water but his thirst was fast getting worse.<br />
<br />
Tip toe running he covered the distance in record time. A quick look around for trouble and he dunked his face into the cool wet water for a long drink.<br />
<br />
It seemed as if an eternity passed while the cool waters quenched his massive thirst. At the sounds of men talking he raised his head and stood there scared as also nervous having been found. Yet the men walked past as if he wasn't even there? They talked of things and never once looked his way as if he just blended somehow into the scenery.<br />
<br />
Then another voice, a friendly one turned his head and gave Bob a sense of pleasured joy. A step and then two more he found himself being drawn to this man with feelings of strange passion and delights.<br />
<br />
Stopping before the little man Bob looked down as the man who spoke of things in some strange dialect man no sense but to bring him some odd thought he was there for Bob's best interest.<br />
<br />
As the man finished his words he took his hand and palm open did slap Bob's cheak three pats and then walked off. <br />
<br />
&quot;How very strange!&quot; thought Bob.<br />
<br />
Standing there Bob was out in the open and for some wonderous reason feeling much more calmed. A slow walk into the back door of the stable brought Bob to stand and look over a fence rail at the main street of this old town.<br />
<br />
Time sort of slipped away as did thinking of what he was watching as he stood there. It seemed later in the day and for some odd reason he had an urge to turn around and walk in through a tall narrow doorway of that barn.<br />
<br />
Looking this way and that as he follwed the urge Bob soon found himself inside the stable's stall isleway. A look this way and that saw the hindend's of many horses sticking out into the isleway. The powerful smell of sweat and hay scents filled the air. At first he thought this a little lousey of a place to be but the longer he stood there the more it all felt very normal somehow.<br />
<br />
A step or two down the isleway had some of the horses wickering in nervous mannner's. He gave a good look to a couple as they for some reason gave him a fond memory of some wonderful feeling but for the life of him he couldn't place the thought.<br />
<br />
Bob stopped and stood by one very nervous horse as the poor creature was doused in lathered sweat. Shaking and stepping from one hoof to another the animal peered back at Bob. A whinnie and then it snuffled a snort as Bob stood there watching in some dull pool of wonder.<br />
<br />
The animal's tail began an slow rise till it hung up high and to one side. A it again peered down it's flanks back at Bob a spurt of brown juice flew out of the thick puffed lips of equine sex.<br />
<br />
The horrid odor at first repelled Bob a half step back but then it gave him a rush of strange sensual lust. A full step forward had Bob's face nose to vulva as he oggled a closer look at this wild pair of black lips.<br />
<br />
A long drawing sniff of her rump was making Bob wousey. It was repulsive but at the same time making him aroused. Blinking his eyes Bob tried not to do as his brain urged him but at last he poked his tongue out and gave a slurping lick of the mare's dripping juices.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head as if it would bring some reason to this crude action did little to help him think. A second long draught of her scent made his upper lip curl and was fast giving him one damn hell of an erection.<br />
<br />
Things were very strange as Bob was doing and tasting of some animal's fluids as he peered about less he was seen. The scent drew his attention back to her large rump only then to have his face and nose mostly doused in a hot stream of mare's urine.<br />
<br />
This should have sent him screaming from the stable and dunk his head in that water trough but it didn't happen that way. Instead Bob stood there as a blind lust for sex and domination filled his thoughts. He wanted to bury his dic into this mare and own her as she would for him and him alone!<br />
<br />
An arm over this side and the other over the other side Bob worked his dic up to the right height and touched a warm moist spot. Huffing he was breathing in and out deep breaths as his dic's end pressed past the mare's lips of wanting sex. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, stupid you'll catch some desease or she'll rack your cock into a wrinking broken, oh wow she is so tight!&quot; moaned Bob to himself.<br />
<br />
Thrusting and onward Bob found himself having sex with this animal! He was delighted in the wild passioned feelings while at the same time feeling so immoral for what he was doing. <br />
<br />
Then that friendly voice called out to him and the little man looked ever so small as Bob looked backwards and down. A thought to back away from his delighted endevor was quickly squelched as the mare's cunt grabbed his dic and began almost sucking out the last drops of his semen.<br />
<br />
Bob could not believe his thrill and wanted not to stop the feeling. he looked back at the little man and was about to ask to be excused when he felt a love slap to his butt and the man walked away chuckling.<br />
<br />
The man stood by that tall doorway and continued to watch as Bob's attention was again turned to the mare milking his shaft. This raw feeling of wild sex was not without it's odd satisfactions. As the last of one orgasum was suddenly building to the next and Bob remained humped over the sweet loving mare for yet another round.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok my dearest' one more round and then I must leave for my Hotel!&quot; thought Bob. <br />
<br />
A peering look for the little man made Bob shudder as the Sun had set and he was still firmly planted inside the mare's cunt. A wiggle then another and reluctantly the mare released Bob's tired but thrilled cock for yet another day.<br />
<br />
Bob backed away and felt his dic slither out the mare's cunt as if it were maybe two feet long. It was the dull thud when fists hit the cobblestoned floor that Bob's hope of a good shower and night's sleep at the Hotel were &quot;Dashed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down then right, then left Bob thought back to earlier and his yelling at Madame' , then her words to him! <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a horse,a stallion horse!&quot; thought Bob.<br />
<br />
Turning in circles he then heard that little man's calm voice call out to him. The man patted Bob's cheak again and made him calm down fast. He looked directly at Bob and in slow motioned speach said, Mister Ryan you are my best stallion stud ever! I want to thank you as I'm sure Mrs. Veenstra would if she could talk right now. Yes, you are a big horse and my best stud stallion and have been these past five years. It happens to every one that madame' changes as they enter their fifth year in animal form. Some greet it with a calm delight and go on being themselves but as whatever she changed them into. others go almost mad to crazy and must be sent to the packing company for a final ending as packaged meat. I do hope you will stay on and continue your duties here, you did enjoy the mare, yes Mister Bob Ryan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob looked over to Mrs. Veenstra and then stood thinking about the tingled feeing of one massive horse cock drying of it's last big thrill.</p>
