<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was approximately two weeks after the two humans who terrorized the town. Killing furies as they made their way to try and assassinate Denise Proudhoof; the anthro tigress fury who confessed in front of the press in Washington D.C to creating the airborne variant of the fury virus. The same virus that caused the Fury Pandemic of the American Thanksgiving holiday of 2023. They killed eleven furies; of the eleven, six were cubs of various ages from newborn to late teens. A press conference was soon held the next day with federal fury agents soon taking custody of the humans. The Komodo dragon fury, at the press conference giving out the names of those that were killed as well as the human’s true target. Seeing Denise at the press conference made it clear that she was still alive and that the human’s failed in their purpose. This press conference was to give a sense of peace to the local population as well as send a message to other humans who had a similar idea; don’t do it.<br />
“Humanity’s time has passed,” the Komodo dragon police sergeant speaking; “trying to kill as many furies will not undo what has happened. We may look like animals, but don’t act like animals except in bed. It is time that those who still cling in their compounds, start accepting the new reality. We are in charge, and we are not going to tolerate murder let alone wanton acts of violence.”<br />
<br />
“Turn that t.v off,” Allison speaking as she rests in the hospital bed. Pressed to her fury bosom was a male anthro cougar cub she gave birth to the other day. Both she and her mate Jimmy Proudhoof were expecting his arrival any day and were prepared to head to the hospital the moment Allison’s water broke. The labor was not as quick as Brittany’s but it did take a few hours to complete. With the birth of their son completed, all that was left was to name their infant cub. Already choosing the name ‘Jimmy Michael Edward Proudhoof J.R.’ His middle names that of his grandfather’s Michael Proudhoof and Edward Heartpaw respectively. The eight pound, ten ounce infant was eagerly suckling on Allison’s breast as she rested.<br />
“They have been playing that press conference over and over for the past two weeks now,” Allison watching her cub drink his fill of her milk. “You’d think they would be talking about something else by now.”<br />
“Well apart from the civil war going on in China,” Jimmy finally turning of the television in the hospital room; “nothing much is going on in the world that is news worthy. Apart from the various major league sports organizations undergoing changes to accommodate furies. Its hard to find safety gear such as helmets that can fit us, let alone a design that doesn&#39;t want to make us rip the item off our heads.”<br />
“So no hockey and football this year,” Allison chortling; sighing as their son finishes feeding and she lightly proceeds to burp him.<br />
“Let me hold my son,” the anthro stag-deer fury watching as the tiny infant makes a tiny belch followed by a yawn.<br />
<br />
*****************<br />
<br />
“…In international news. The communist party of China suffered another disastrous defeat as the fury resistance captured Tianjin and Dalian. Two port cities that sit south and east of Beijing respectively. Analyst predict that with the loss of the two ports, the communist party will soon fall once Beijing is in the paws of furies. The President of Taiwan has continued to express his support for the liberation and the return of democracy to China…”<br />
<br />
Michael turned off the television as made the finishing touches to a small celebratory dinner he has prepared for his son Jimmy and his mate Allison. Both he and Denise have yet to visit the two and the new grand-cub at the hospital. Unable to do so yesterday as he was busy at his restaurant hosting the police and state troopers as a thank you for their work in stopping and capturing the two human terrorists. Denise who is the head of the CDC, had to engage in several video conferences with the president of the united states as well as the head of the World Health organization. Needing to co-ordinate the new vaccines to help deal with the new fury variants of Mumps, Measles, Polio and other childhood maladies that medicine has virtually eliminated. Michael was to meet her at the hospital but wanted to finish his surprise first.<br />
<br />

<br />
“what is it Dad,” Jimmy looking at the Tupperware dishes full of what looks to be a stew, but is not sure that is what it is.<br />
“Its called Coq Au Vin,” Michael encouraging the two to eat; “a French dish of braised chicken with mushroom garlic and assorted vegetables cooked in a red burgundy wine.”<br />
“I can’t have alcohol right now,” Allison speaking up; “I just gave birth and will be breast feeding our son.”<br />
“The alcohol is cooked out,” Michael responding; “try it. It is a dish made famous by an American chef who was classically train in French cuisine.&quot;<br />
Both take a bite and react with surprise and delight as the tart wine is balanced from the other ingredients with in the dish. Soon Denise enters the room with a helium balloon and a stuffed teddy bear from the gift shop to congratulate the couple.<br />
“Oooh that looks tasty,” Denise eyeing the contents in the Tupperware dishes.<br />
“There is more at home,” Michael giving a wry smile; “as well as dessert.”<br />
<br />
“Will Brittany and Jake show up,” Denise putting the balloon and teddy bear by the hospital crib; getting a good look at the cream furred cougar cub sleeping peacefully; “oh look at him sleeping.” Denise couldn’t help but give out the usual oohs and ahs as she stared at the tiny newborn cub.<br />
“They have their paws full with the twins,” Jimmy answering as he finishes his Tupperware dish of Coq Au Vin; “they might not make it until tomorrow.”<br />
“Or after I and Jimmy Jr are discharged from the hospital,” Allison adding as she starts licking the container clean; he rough feline like tongue getting as much of the sauce out of the bowl as possible. “Wow that was delicious.”<br />
“And your parents,” Michael collecting the now empty dishes; “have Edward and Jullian visited?”<br />
“A few hours before you,” Allison answered; “they showed up just after I finished feeding Jimmy.”<br />
Haha,” Jimmy chortling; “very funny.”<br />
“Not you,” Allison giving an exasperated sigh; “our son. Jimmy J.R. They stayed for an hour then left.”<br />
Knowing those two,” Michael giving a wry smile; “they are at home making mad love with each other.”<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
At the Heartpaw household the sounds of intense rutting could be heard as a female anthro cougar was getting mounted by an anthro red fox fury. The sight of her fury breasts swinging and his fury balls slapping her in time to his thrusting was a sight that would make humans shudder. Her moans as his knot invades her swollen entrance, locking the two together as his trusts now become short and forceful. Soon they both hit their peaks and the fox fury bites down on the female cougar’s neck just as his balls clench and he starts pumping his seed into her fertile womb.<br />
<br />
They stay still for a few minutes as they each ride their respective orgasms before Julian soon collapses on the bed.<br />
“Are you certain you want a cub,” Edward finally speaking as his vulpine rod is still locked into Julian’s tight snatch.<br />
“I stopped taking my heat suppression pills last month,” Julian responding as she gasps from the orgasm still roiling through her. “I want you to make me pregnant,” Julian muttering. &quot;I just hope I enter heat soon so you can really fuck me senseless,&quot; Julian adding.<br />
“Well in that case,” Edward giving off a playful growl; “allow me to keep rutting you then.” Edward doesn’t wait for Julian to respond as he starts to buck and thrust his hips, ensuring that his current erection isn’t going to go away any time as works to cum in her for a second time.</p>
