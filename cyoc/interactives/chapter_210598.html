<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom began to whine pathetically, like any submissive bitch would when trying to escape an alpha males advances. He was still frozen in place as he watched his wife circling him, inspecting his body like some prey she wanted to pounce on! <br />
<br />
&#39;Samantha....I mean....Sam. I really don&#39;t want to stay a dog.&#39; Tom begged &#39;Im sorry for everything! I&#39;m sorry I turned you into a dog. I&#39;m sorry I let Max mate with me. I don&#39;t know what came over me, it just felt so good in this body&#39; <br />
<br />
Samantha was still looking at Tom&#39;s rear. His dark lipped slit called to her masculine canine instincts she had given herself. She had never been into women before, but something about seeing Tom&#39;s sex just made her so hard! Her throbbing member wanted to claim Tom right now! But still, she started to feel sorry for Tom. She was, after all, responsible for forcing Tom into this predictment. <br />
<br />
She starred at the rear end of the skinny shaking greyhound, knowing full well that she could just mount it right now. Thrust her member deep into the bitch and just go to town on her, if she wanted to. Tom was maybe half Samantha&#39;s weight now and would not be able to put up much of a fight. <br />
<br />
Samantha shook her head, trying to free her thoughts from her instincts. &#39;F it!&#39; she snarled &#39;Fine Tom! Assuming Max hasn&#39;t knocked you up already. I will turn you into a &quot;man&quot; once I turn back. Though after the night you just had with Max, I&#39;m not sure how I can ever look at you as a &quot;man&quot; again.&#39; She whined, the urge to mate was so strong. But she knew should must hold off until the hour was up and she would turn back. <br />
<br />
Hearing this, Tom&#39;s tail slowly started to wag. &#39;Oh thank!&#39; he barked at his wife. He turned around to face her directly. He looked into the dark eyes of his rottweiler wife. Tom once again found himself looking her over. She was massive! Even for a rottweiler. And she was so handsome! Her droopy looking muzzle, her floppy black ears, even the drool dripping from her open mouth as she breathed, seemed to make Tom&#39;s female urges resurface. She had a very muscular stocking build to her body, which stood in complete contrast to his own skinny frame greyhound body. <br />
<br />
Tom couldn&#39;t help himself as he came closer to his wife and licked at her slightly open drooling mouth. As close to a kiss as dogs could do. He tasted her drool on his tongue, but he didn&#39;t care. He wanted to show her how much he loved her. Even as a dog. <br />
<br />
&#39;I love you Samantha&#39; he said as he licked his wife again, this time letting his tongue go into her mouth and lap at her long canine tongue. <br />
<br />
&#39;I love you too Tom....&#39; she responded but continued &#39;but if you don&#39;t back up, I won&#39;t be able to fight these urges anymore and I may just FUCK YOU!&#39; she ended in a slight growl. <br />
<br />
Tom back away quickly. His tail once again tucked. Tom didn&#39;t know what to do. He could easily tell from her swollen member, that Samantha was fighting some strong urges.<br />
<br />
&#39;Sorry Tom....It&#39;s just so hard to concentrate! I&#39;m just so...horny! This thing is so hard!&#39; Samantha growled again. <br />
<br />
Suddenly Tom&#39;s slightly floppy ears perked up. &#39;I have an idea!&#39; He started. &#39;I will only stay this way if I get pregnant. So what if I help you relieve yourself without the risk of getting knocked up?!&#39; Tom barked happily. <br />
<br />
Samantha hearing this, knew what Tom was getting at. <br />
<br />
&#39;Lay down on your back and I&#39;ll take care of everything!&#39; Tom barked excitedly, as his tail wagged behind him. <br />
<br />
&#39;Oh!&#39; Samantha replied with a odd whine of happiness &#39;This should be fun!&#39; She wanted no time. She quickly laid down and after a few odd looking failed attempts to roll onto her back, she managed to do so. Her massive red rocket now sticking up in the air at a slight angle. At the base of her erection was a hard knot right outside her black fured sheath. <br />
<br />
Tom quickly walked over to his wife and positioned himself over her, his rear end over her head and his head over her member. <br />
<br />
Samantha had an odd sense of anger all of a sudden. Something about being on her back and Tom being over her made her upset! But she fought over these feelings, knowing what was about to happen. She then started smelling a very pleasant aroma coming from the rear end of the greyhound above her. She looked up and noticed it was coming from her husband&#39;s dark vagina lips. She could see they were swollen and wet. Samantha licked her muzzle with her massive tongue. <br />
<br />
Tom stood there. Looking at his wife&#39;s penis. It was massive. It was hard. It was hot! He lowered his head and began to lick at it. It tasted salty and odd, but he loved it! He wrapped his long tongue around the throbbing dick, working it up and down. Whines of pleasure began to come from his wife. This only encouraged Tom more. He then removed his tongue, opened his muzzle and grabbed her dick in his mouth. Luckily for both Samantha and himself, greyhounds had long muzzles and he was about to take her entire length all at once. <br />
<br />
Tom felt the massive cock in his mouth. He felt the veins, the hard tip, and even the knot at it&#39;s base. He began moving his head up and down, letting the dick slide in and out of his long wet muzzle. The dick rubbing against his tongue as he moved. <br />
<br />
&#39;Oh.....Tom....that feels so....good!&#39; Samantha barked in pleasure. &#39;No wonder....you liked blowjobs so much!&#39; <br />
<br />
Tom couldn&#39;t deny it, it also loved giving them! He felt his pussy grow wetter as he felt the urge to be fucked growing inside of his canine lower regions. His pussy grew so wet that it started dripping onto his wifes head. <br />
<br />
Samantha could feel the drips from Sam&#39;s pussy hitting her head. Suddenly a few drips landed in her open muzzle and she got a taste of her husband. She loved it. He tasted like a bitch! And she wanted more! She lifted her head slightly, pressed her cold wet nose firmly into her husband&#39;s snatch and sniffed deeply, taking in his scent. <br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s, muzzle still full of dick, eyes widened at the sudden presence of his wife&#39;s nose! Her nose caused a wave of pleasure shoot through his body and he paused mid head bob. Then, instinctively began to rub his pussy against her nose. <br />
<br />
&#39;Someones horny!&#39; Samantha responded. &#39;How about this&#39; Samantha extended her tongue and began to lap at the swollen black lips of Tom&#39;s vagina. <br />
<br />
&#39;Mmmmhmmm&#39; was all Tom could say with muzzle full of dog dick. <br />
<br />
Samantha started getting more into it, after tasting Tom&#39;s sweet juices. She then inserted her long tongue into her husband and working her tongue in and out!<br />
<br />
Tom was shaking in pleasure. He then continued to bob his head up and down over his wife&#39;s penis. <br />
<br />
The room was filled with the sounds of whines and slobbering noises. The smells of canine sex filling the once happy human home. If anyone would have walked into the room, they would have been treated to the sight of a large rottweiler and skinny greyhound going at it 69 style on the hardwood floor! <br />
<br />
The love making went on for a while, Tom as already experienced several orgasms, but he continued to please his wife until she came. Surprisingly Samantha lasted a long time! <br />
<br />
After a while of love making thats when...</p>
