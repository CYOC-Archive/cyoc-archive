<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Could he get revenge on Dustin by making him a toy like this action figure he just repaired? Dustin wouldn´t be able to do anything without Ty&#39;s permission. Ty grinned at that thought. Dustin at his mercy was a great idea, so he started planning his fate.<br />
When he finished the plan in his head, he started with saying: “I wish for Dustin to appear here in my room, standing frozen before me, only able to move his head. I also wish that nobody but me can hear him so that nobody comes looking if he is to loud.”<br />
Dustin was lying in his bed, only wearing his to big boxers, crying for his fate. He didn´t know how, but Ty had changed him and his parents looked as if this was normal. How was it normal he was suddenly looking younger and smaller? But he had no idea how to get Ty to change him back.<br />
With a sudden jolt Dustin felt he was now standing instead of lying down, but it took a second or two to clearly see his surroundings. He looked at a grinning Ty, who just sat on his own bed in front of him. With shock written over his face Dustin realized he couldn´t move his body in any way, only his mouth and eyes were moving.<br />
“Ah Dustin, just who I wanted to see over here.” Ty said. “And you are already naked beside that boxers, that&#39;s even better. Makes it easier to see you change.”<br />
“Please Ty. I´m sorry for what I did. Please change me back to normal.” Dustin plead with Ty.<br />
Ty still grinned at him. “Sure, I wish that you look like you did before I first changed you.” It had been the first thing he wanted to do anyway. If he was able to play with Dustin, it should be the original after all.<br />
Dustin couldn´t believe his luck, that was to easy. But Dustin didn´t thought for after he changed back at the moment as his body grow back like it was before. One thing didn´t change, Dustin noticed when he finished growing. He still couldn´t move. “Thanks for changing me back, Ty. But could I please move again?” he asked far more politely as he normally would.<br />
“No, you stand right where I want you to. You see, I just wanted you back to normal before I change you another way. Now, to be a bit evil and get revenge, I wish that your boxers merge with your skin while pushing inwards, so it will look like you have nothing down there, even when its only trapped inside.” Ty explained, pointing at Dustin&#39;s bulge showing through his boxers.<br />
Dustin&#39;s face went white as he heard Ty, as he could feel his boxers tightening around his cock, balls and ass. But instead of it being pushed away by his cock it felt like an iron hard plate pressing it back painfully. At the same time it pressed his ass a bit, but never was pushed inside his asshole. So it looked like he had a completely round ass without any opening. As fast as the change was from Ty&#39;s view, Dustin moaned in pain from his flattened groin. But he didn´t know Ty wasn´t finished with him.<br />
Not waiting for Dustin to speak, Ty continued: “Next, while you are build nice, you are not really posing for it. So I wish for you to strike a heroic pose for the world to see your body. Then I wish for your skin to recolor so while still naked you look like you are wearing something fitting you.”<br />
Dustin couldn´t stop his arms from bending into shape. His right arm was raised above his head, his hand gripping something invisible. His left arm was bend in front of his chest with a balled fist at the end. His stance was wide, his legs a bit bend with both feet firmly on the ground. And his head bend back a bit, giving Dustin a viewpoint to look at Ty&#39;s ceiling. <br />
Then Dustin&#39;s skin felt like thousands of ants were running over it. He couldn´t see himself, but Ty watched with interest as Dustin&#39;s skin turned to look like he was wearing clothes.<br />
It started with Dustin&#39;s feet. While Dustin didn´t feel any difference, Ty watched as the toes merged into a round ball-like mitten. Then the skin turned black from the merged toes back to the ankles. While the soles gained a detailed profile, the upside of the feet separated into small strings to look like tightly knot shoelaces for the boots. Up from the black ankles a short part of skin turned grey, resembling socks.<br />
After a bit of skin that remained normal colored the next part turned dark-blue, resembling a jeans. It quickly covered the rest of Dustin&#39;s legs, vanishing his knees from sight. The white colored skin from the merged boxers turned dark-blue as well. Just above the point were his cock was hidden a black button formed, and Ty mentally wished it was connected to Dustin&#39;s trapped cock. That way he could torture Dustin even more with his trapped genitals. The dark-blue jeans ended above the button, the rim turning into a black band, resembling a belt.<br />
Up from there Dustin&#39;s skin got mostly white, vanishing his belly button and both nipples on their way up. The white ended at Dustin&#39;s neck, but moved along his arms until it reached his elbows, hiding them from sight as well. In bright red letters on Dustin&#39;s chest stood his name, “DUSTIN”, while on his back stood in the same colored letters “TY´S TOY” and below that “No.01”. It resembled a print on t-shirt. Then, while the rest of his arms remained normal, on Dustin&#39;s hands the skin turned dark-brown, resembling gloves. Finally his the top layer of his hair grew around his head before it turned into a leather helmet, turning also dark-brown.<br />
Finally finding his voice, Dustin plead again: “Please Ty, stop this. I know I was really an ass to you, but what is your goal with this? Embarrassing me?”<br />
Ty still grinned at him when he answered: “No, I won´t stop now, Dustin. You have earned what I do to you, and you will soon know your fate. But I need to fetch something, so don´t run away.” Ty laughs as he leaves his room, leaving Dustin standing there pondering what Ty would do next. He was really worried that this all wasn´t harmless fun, at least not for him.<br />
Meanwhile Ty moved over to Dustin&#39;s room to look for things he could use. He could have simply wished for something to appear and take the needed shape, but if he used Dustin&#39;s things it would be more interesting for him and crueler for Dustin. Ty took one of Dustin&#39;s sport trophies out of its place, standing it by the door to take with him. The other object Ty took was Dustin&#39;s prized football, which Dustin saw as some kind of lucky charm. <br />
He then returned with both things to his own room, showing them to Dustin as he placed them down. Dustin started to scream and curse Ty until he said: “I wish you were silent for now.” While Dustin still screamed around it was as if somebody had turned the volume down to zero, muting Dustin. Ty enjoyed the silence for a minute before he continued with his plan. Ty took the trophy first and pushed it into Dustin&#39;s raised hand, adjusting the fingers a little. Afterwards he placed the football on Dustin&#39;s other arm before he explained: “Now I wish for the trophy to become a big, blunt sword and for the football to reshape into a shield strapped to your left arm in front of you.”<br />
Dustin was still silently screaming at Ty as the trophy changed shape. It become longer and flattened in its bulkier parts. The part Ty had pressed into his hand turned into the hilt and the base become a pommel, while the rest turned into the blade with a short guard just above his hand. The new sword wasn´t as heavy as the trophy had been, but that didn´t help Dustin in any way. The football flattened against his arm while growing into a wooden, round shield strapped to Dustin&#39;s forearm by two leather straps. On the wooden surface appeared the picture of a football to mock Dustin even more. It also hid his name on the t-shirt from clear view. Now Dustin had an idea what Ty planned for him and started crying.<br />
Ty saw Dustin&#39;s realization and his grin got even wider. “So you have an idea of your fate now. It´s not much left to do, but let´s get over with it. I wish that your whole body turns into indestructible plastic. And to finish you of, you will shrink to the same size as the action figure on my desk and gain a determined grin and look fitting your pose.”<br />
As Dustin was still silenced he couldn´t plead with Ty anymore. He felt as his body turned plastic, as it itched all over his skin and he got cold. The shrinking was a tickling feeling and he watched in horror as the world grew around him. But as his face contorted into the wished determination he felt completely hopeless. What could he do now? Would Ty keep him this way or change him again? And what of his parents and his life?<br />
Ty grinned at his new toy. Finally Dustin wouldn´t annoy him anymore. But there were still a few things to do for him. But the rest wasn´t meant to be heard by Dustin, who still had his senses intact, so he thought about his wishes instead of speaking them out.<br />
“I wish that Dustin remains sane in his trapped state. His senses will stay intact as they are, but his sense of touch will double. While he can´t move himself, his body is easy to manipulate from the outside like an real action figure as he resembles now. But he can´t be separated from his new sword or shield, as they are like parts of his body. His body won´t need anything, because as an inanimate object he doesn´t need to breath or eat. As he is my toy, nobody will remember him being human but me, and everything he had will be mine instead.”<br />
Dustin was still trying to do anything, but like he had the feeling before it was just hopeless. He felt a small tingle go through his body and got more aware of how cold he was. Just lifeless, cold plastic. He saw Ty move closer to him and before he know it Ty lifted him, gripping around his torso with his left hand, and Dustin got aware of the fact that Ty could easily crush him now. His grip was a lot stronger than he would have believed before. That it just felt so because his sense of touch was increased didn´t cross his mind, and neither did the fact that Ty had made him indestructible. Ty put him next to the figure on his desk, facing it, before he left the room, leaving Dustin alone.</p>
