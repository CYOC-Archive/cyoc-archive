<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tori Vordenburg was driving through Stokerville on her way back to the motel she and her little band were staying. &quot;I can&#39;t say my little chat with Matriarch Carmilla was very reassuring,&quot; the monster hunter said to the others. &quot;She was really fucking cryptic about why Beck&#39;s in Japan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s something personal,&quot; Megan shrugged. &quot;Like... I don&#39;t know... maybe Beck had... an allergic reaction to their transformation... and they needed an emergency magical medical procedure... that&#39;s only available in Japan?&quot; The fledgling vampire didn&#39;t sound confident in her own argument.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dae yersel&#39; a favor &#39;n&#39; ne&#39;er go intae politics,&quot; Fiona said dryly. &quot;Ye cannae argie tae save yer bonnie life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or maybe Carmilla sent her there as a gift for some kyonsh&#299; friends of hers!&quot; Tori snapped. &quot;Or maybe there&#39;s a witch over there who knows some rare spell to complete the brainwashing! Use your fucking head, Megan!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, honey,&quot; Erzulie said, putting a dusky hand on her girlfriend&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Maybe you should speak to Selena before you make up your mind about the von Karnsteins&#39; designs on Beck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I <i>should</i> talk with Selena!&quot; Tori fumed. &quot;I need to tell that kid she&#39;s being duped by Carmilla. I don&#39;t know <i>why</i> the leeches need a pack of werehyenas in Stokerville for their inscrutable bloodsucker plans, but they apparently do, and they&#39;re fucking exploiting Selena&#39;s feelings of isolation from her werewolf pack to make it happen!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who can say?&quot; Erzulie sighed. &quot;If you ask me, we were being just as sketchy as you make the von Karnsteins out to be when you had me curse Renata&#39;s fox-skin belt to do nothing. She&#39;ll be crushed when she finds out her new skulk isn&#39;t going to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s too young to be messing around with magic,&quot; Tori argued. &quot;She needs to fucking leave this shit to her elders. We can always reverse the curse if our research on the Inhibitor Potion checks out. But <i>somebody</i> needs to do the fucking research before my ditzy cousin goes and starts up a goddamn <i>werefox skulk</i> on a fucking whim!&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan suddenly began sniffing the air wafting into the car from the open window. &quot;Hey, why does this neighborhood <i>really</i> smell like sex? I mean, like, a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it?&quot; Tori asked, perplexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you wouldn&#39;t believe!&quot; Megan said. &quot;It smells like there&#39;s a whole damn orgy going on in... <i>that</i> mansion!&quot; the vampire fledgling pointed at a modern, almost futuristic-looking McMansion on the corner of the street. &quot;I guess my enhanced vampire senses can pick that up. And it smells like... animals fucking. No, not animals. The scent&#39;s like something between animals and humans... though there <i>are</i> some pure human scents mixed up in there, too. Not many, but some. Oh, and there&#39;s some vampires in there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Tori interrogated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d know the scent of my own kind anywhere,&quot; Megan insisted. &quot;I guess it&#39;s an instinct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going in!&quot; Tori said. &quot;Well... Erzulie and I are, at least. Remember, we need to keep you and Fiona as secret weapons if we&#39;re gonna infiltrate whatever Beck has going on in Japan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tori leaped out of the car, followed by her witchy girlfriend. &quot;Here goes nothing,&quot; Tori said, running a hand through her jagged blonde hair as she rang the doorbell.<br />
<br />
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />
<br />
Inside Chloe&#39;s mansion, the orgy as in full swing. Selena and Tatiana were having a blast spit-roasting Jenna when they heard the doorbell ring. &quot;I&#39;ll get it!&quot; Chloe said, shifting into human form and hastily wrapping a towel around her shrunken human body.<br />
<br />
Chloe opened the door and found herself looking at a girl in a leather jacket with spiky chin-length blonde hair and a thin girl with deep mocha skin, hair worn in dreadlocks and a fashion sense somewhere between boho and hobo. The blonde look seriously pissed off, while the black girl had a mix of caution and apology on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; Chloe asked, unsure of who these girls could be.<br />
<br />
&quot;The name&#39;s Victoria Vordenburg,&quot; the blond said sternly, barging past Chloe. &quot;Friends call me Tori.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m her girlfriend Erzulie,&quot; the black girl said, nervously playing with the white headscarf wrapped around her dreadlocks. &quot;Don&#39;t mind Tori. She&#39;s very... &#39;passionate&#39; about her life&#39;s work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is?&quot; Chloe asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a monster hunter, and this party&#39;s fucking under investigation, bitches!&quot; Tori said loudly. The words echoed through the indoor pool as Tori stepped into the room. The monster hunter surveyed the sea of entwined furry bodies in the throes of amorous passion. Tori liked to think of herself as a monogamous girl with eyes only for Erzulie; orgies weren&#39;t really her scene. Nonetheless, she was quite tolerant of other people&#39;s ideas of recreation... unless it involved sleeping with vampires. She frowned as she spotted two of the hated leeches making love to the werehyenas. She frowned before shouting. &quot;You heard me! This is a fucking investigation! Which one of you is Alpha Selena?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Selena said, blushing under hir fur as shi hastily pulled hir erect cock out of Jenna. It was frustrating to break things off without finding release, but Tori clearly wouldn&#39;t wait. &quot;This is about Beck Hamilton, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it, girl,&quot; Tori nodded. &quot;I take it you&#39;ve seen them? They&#39;re non-binary (assigned female at birth) and use they/them pronouns. They&#39;re a freckly kid with light brown hair in a fade cut with frosted platinum tips. They&#39;re tallish and really damn buff. They&#39;re usually dressed in something like ripped jeans, a denim jacket with a midriff-baring spaghetti-strap top underneath, and converse shoes. They&#39;ve also got a belly button piercing. Ring any fucking bells, alpha?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Beck&#39;s in my pack,&quot; Selena nodded as hir unsatisfied cock ruefully softened. &quot;Shi&#39;s not here, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Tori glared. &quot;Carmilla and Morgana appear to have fucking shipped them off to Japan. What I want to know is why!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck this bullshit!&quot; Kibibi snarled. The black-furred, gold-spotted werehyena lunged at Tori and grabbed her by her leather jacket, hoisting the monster hunter off the ground. &quot;Give me one good Moon-damned reason why I shouldn&#39;t rip your fucking throat out, you nosy bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... asshole!&quot; Tori grunted as she struggled to escape Kibibi&#39;s claws.<br />
<br />
Kibibi suddenly flinched as shi felt scissors on hir fur. The next thing shi knew, shi was seeing Erzulie holding a lit match under a clipping of hir own fur. An uncomfortably hot feeling suddenly spread over Kibibi&#39;s entire body. Was shi seriously going to burn up? &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; the African werehyena gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surely you haven&#39;t forgotten so much of your African heritage that you can&#39;t recognize our motherland&#39;s unique witchcraft tradition,&quot; Erzulie smirked. &quot;This is Voodoo. Now, assuming you don&#39;t plan on burning to a crisp in the next minute or two, I&#39;d suggest you decide to <i>not</i> murder my girlfriend. I promise you, we&#39;re not here to kill... unless you <i>start</i> the violence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kibibi reluctantly dropped Tori. Erzulie nodded and snuffed out the match. Kibibi sighed in relief as the awful burning faded away into blissful nothingness.<br />
<br />
Tori picked herself up from the poolside tiles and marched up to Selena. &quot;Now that <i>that&#39;s</i> over, why&#39;s my cousin in Japan? Are Morgan and Carmilla trying to fucking hide them there for some reason?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing like that!&quot; Selena protested. &quot;Some of hir packmates were already going there because they wanted to learn a Japanese sport to get in shape, and Beck wanted in.&quot; Selena discreetly left out the part about how the sport was sumo and how &#39;getting in shape&#39; meant &#39;getting fat&#39; in this case.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; Tori scoffed sarcastically. &quot;Because it&#39;s <i>so damn hard</i> for all of you fucking slabs of bestial muscle to stay in shape! Sure. So, who&#39;s teaching them this Japanese sport?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, a kappa dude called Ky&#363;ri-sensei,&quot; Ashlee guilelessly blurted out. Hir mate Zoey gave hir an annoyed slap for hir loose lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noted,&quot; Tori smirked. &quot;By the way, Selena, where do you get off recruiting Beck into your goddamn pack without telling my Aunt Kim?! That was seriously shitty. Did your cold-skinned bed-warmer ask you to keep it secret?&quot; Tori glanced furiously at Tatiana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tats had nothing to do with this!&quot; Selena snapped. &quot;I kept it a secret because I had no clue your aunt knew a damn thing about the supernatural! I didn&#39;t want to get sent to a mental institution, or worse, a government laboratory, so I&#39;ve only been telling the people I&#39;m recruiting. Is that wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not precisely,&quot; Tori said icily, &quot;but it&#39;s murky moral waters when you&#39;re dealing with minors. On that note, aren&#39;t most of you a bit young for an orgy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you threatening to tell on us?&quot; Chloe growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t tell anybody about you being werehyenas,&quot; Tori said, &quot;but I just might tell your parents that I caught you having a sex party here if any of you fucking insist on obstructing my investigation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;d rather play nice!&quot; Erzulie chimed in, an awkward smile plastered on her mocha face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erzulie&#39;s not wrong,&quot; Tori said, her face softening. &quot;You&#39;re just kids. I&#39;m conducting this investigation to protect all of you as much as Beck. Selena, please be careful. Be <i>fucking</i> careful. I know these bloodsuckers, and I&#39;m <i>sure</i> they&#39;re using you as a pawn. And then there&#39;s your mom. She&#39;s got a shitty temper, and she won&#39;t like what you&#39;re doing. And then there&#39;s the matter of a skulk of werefoxes setting up camp, as if Stokerville didn&#39;t have <i>enough</i> monster factions sowing chaos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, I&#39;m on the lookout for werefox-related trouble,&quot; Selena assured the monster hunter. &quot;Dealing with them is on Kibibi&#39;s to-do list.&quot; Shi gestured to the black-furred, gold-spotted werehyena. &quot;And I&#39;ve been doing pretty well at concealing things from Mom so far. As for Clan von Karnstein, they are NOT using me.&quot; Selena threw hir muscular, furry arm around Tatiana&#39;s pale, unclothed shoulders. &quot;They&#39;re helping me because Tats loves me. Helping me means making Tats happy, simple as that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll consider the possibility,&quot; Tori frowned. &quot;Thank you for cooperating. That&#39;s all for now, I guess. Just remember to <i>mind your manners</i> and you&#39;ll get no trouble from us. Well, enjoy your fucking. Laters!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, <i>that</i> was troubling!&quot; Tatiana said as she watched Tori and Erzulie leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we told them enough to keep them off our backs for at least a few days, Tats,&quot; Selena smiled, pushing Tatiana into the warm waters of the pool. &quot;Besides, they&#39;re probably off to Japan. For now, how would you like to feel my rough tongue on that growing clit of yours? And maybe I can fill your mouth with my big ol&#39; dick?&quot; With that, the orgy resumed in full force.<br />
<br />
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br />
<br />
&quot;You satisfied?&quot; Erzulie asked her girlfriend as they shut the front door behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Tori grinned. &quot;Now we have a name. Ky&#363;ri-sensei, a kappa. That&#39;ll give Megan and Fiona a person of interest to look for. Even better, Selena doesn&#39;t know about Megan and Fiona, and neither do Morgana or Carmilla thanks to your magical shields on them. Everyone&#39;ll think you and I are headed to Japan to follow the lead. Little do they know that we have people who can handle that while we figure out the situation in Stokerville.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You always were a clever one, sweetie,&quot; Erzulie laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a pretty damn quick thinker yourself, babe,&quot; Tori winked. &quot;Thanks for saving my life in there. I thought the big one with the black fur and gold spots was gonna fucking end me for a sec.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anytime, cutie,&quot; Erzulie said, kissing her partner in every sense of the word. &quot;Now let&#39;s fill Megan and Fiona in and leave the pack to enjoy their orgy. We&#39;ve stepped on enough furry toes for now.&quot;</p>
