<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan sat on his bed, scrolling through his social media newsfeed. His impromptu research session had turned up nothing—not really surprising given he hadn’t had much to go on in the first place—and after a while he started feeling silly about worrying about what some random stranger can come up to him out of the blue to “warn” him of. Why had she been in that alley anyway? Was she watching him? Ryan forced himself to shake off the thought. It must have just been some crazy woman who picked him out at random, he thought to himself. Nothing to be worried about…..<br />
<br />
Glancing out his window, Ryan was startled to see that dusk was starting to fall. He’d been on his phone for much longer than he’d realized. Remembering that Patrick had said students got in free at Sparks tonight, Ryan sighed. “Better start getting ready” he said to himself. He was still feeling  a bit hungover, but the club was definitely going to be packed, and that meant there were going to be plenty of hot girls there; maybe even this Rebecca girl Patrick kept talking about? He had to admit, he was very interested in meeting her.<br />
<br />
Ryan walked over to his closet, pausing to take a look at the large mirror hanging on the wall next to it. As soon as he did he felt a wave of dizziness wash over him. That’s funny, he thought, it’s just like last—-<br />
<br />
Ryan rapidly began to shrink, his body hair evaporating and his muscles melting away as his six foot frame shrank, finally stopping at 5’6. His face softened, becoming feminine, as his hips widened. His black hair rapidly flowed outwards, cascading down to just above his butt. His chest expanded outwards, a pair of perky DD  breasts materializing as the changes continued. His stomach became as tight and flat as before, his arms and legs became slim and feminine, and, with a final pop, Ryan’s manhood morphed into a vagina.<br />
<br />
Next his clothing began to change; his shirt and shorts changed color, each becoming  red, and melting together into a short, tight, low cut dress that emphasized the new girl’s curves. His sneakers morphed into a black pair of three inch heels, and Ryan’s eyes glowed a bright yellow.  Feeling a bizarre sense of deja-vu, Ryan struggled to think through the haze which was now starting to cloud his mind—he had to call Mindy, had to stop himself from going…..go…lea….wha…..<br />
<br />
Rebecca blinked repeatedly, shaking her head to clear it. Why in the world wouldn’t she go out tonight? There was a huge party at the hottest club around tonight, and she had a feeling the bouncers weren’t going to interested in checking IDs, especially not of someone as sexy as she was. Checking the mirror one last time to make sure her makeup looked perfect, Rebecca grabbed her shiny silver purse and strutted out the door.<br />
<br />
Sparks was strategically located only three blocks away from the bulk of student housing on this campus, and Rebecca arrived in front in no time at all. The line was already halfway around the block by the time she got there, but Rebecca didn’t mind. She quickly struck up conversations with some of the other girls waiting to get in, and soon the whole group was happily talking and giggling. <br />
<br />
The line began to move quicker and quicker as the bouncers were told to pick up the pace a bit letting people in; they hadn’t wanted to let the staff get too swamped at first, but a massive line outside their building would attract the attention of  campus police, who might decide to start carding students going into the club, which was the last thing anyone needed. Soon, Rebecca and her new friends had reached the front door, with the bouncers simply waving them right on in.<br />
<br />
The club was absolutely packed; there must have been close to two hundred students in there already, with more arriving every minute. Thankfully, Sparks had been designed specifically for such massive crowds, and while the club was crowded it didn’t feel claustrophobic. They’d hired one of the best DJs in town for the event tonight, and the music had everyone in the mood to dance, party and just generally enjoy themselves. <br />
<br />
Rebecca loved it. She was in her element; Sparks had a huge dance floor and she and the other girls made their way out there. Soon a large group of boys joined them, and Rebecca spotted one of the guys she’s met last night at the pool party—Paul? No, Patrick, that was it. She giggled to herself at how excited he looked to see her. He had it baaaaad, she thought, and why not? She was the sexiest girl in here. <br />
<br />
Carefully making her way through the crowd, Rebecca sauntered up to Patrick. It was hard to hear what anyone was saying with how loud the music was, so she leaned in close, giving him a nice glimpse of her cleavage in the process. “Patrick! Long time no see!” She said with a giggle. He smiled back at her. “Hey Rebecca. I’m glad you came, I wasn’t sure if you’d be here tonight. My friend Ryan said he might come by, but I guess he must have gotten swamped with  homework or something.” Patrick responded. <br />
<br />
The name Ryan sounded oddly familiar, registering somewhere in Rebecca’s mind. Had she met Ryan? Maybe last night? She mentally shrugged. She’d met a looot of guys last night, it could have been any one of them. After a while names and faces tended to blur, especially with the amount of alcohol she’d had. <br />
<br />
Patrick, meanwhile, couldn’t believe his luck. He’d gone to a pregame before coming here, so he was already nicely buzzed, and then the sheer luck of running into the girl he’d most wanted to see again? In a place as packed as Sparks was tonight? Okay Patrick, play it cool. Girls don’t like it if you come across too eager, he thought to himself, taking a deep breath. One of Rebecca’s friends, a blonde who’d introduced herself as Taylor, came up, visibly tipsy already and yelled “C’mon girl, we’re doing shots!” <br />
<br />
Rebecca gave Patrick an apologetic look and a wink. “I’ll be right back, don’t go anywhere!” She said as she allowed Taylor to pull her through the crowd over to the bar where the other girls—Amy, Hannah, Monique and Jenny—were waiting. The bartender had poured a line of shots for them, and with a cry of “to the next four years!”the girls picked them up and drank. Whatever it was was strong stuff; Hannah coughed a couple times, and and Jenny made a disgusted face. Rebecca, though, felt almost energized, as if the alcohol had only made her more excited to be out here, in the club, the center of attention, with all the guys checking her out and all the girls wanting to be her. <br />
<br />
The rest of the night passed in a blur for Rebecca; she danced with her friends, and drank, and let handsome guys buy her drinks, and flirted with Patrick, cuddling up to him to take some selfies, and then had him take some pictures of her and the rest of the girls. She had a wonderful time, and when 3am rolled around and Sparks shut down for the night she was throughly disappointed. Patrick had wandered off a short time ago, saying something about staying at a friend’s place for the night, so Rebecca said goodbye to her new friends, and slowly walked back to the apartment. The other girls had been shocked that she didn’t have a social media presence, and helped her set one up, posting the pictures they’d agreed were best from last night and tonight. She sighed happily as she made it back to her own room and shut the door tightly, collapsing onto her bed. She was asleep almost before she hit the covers.<br />
<br />
The next morning…..</p>
