<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The meeting continued for nearly an hour, with Matthew finishing his company policy talk before Clarissa presented their strategy for the Peterson case. Jen orgasmed several times during the meeting, no one had told her to stop masturbating and she found herself using all of her will power to keep going. Her cries and gasps would periodically interrupt the presentations but both Matthew and Clarissa would simply continue when the noise had died down.<br />
<br />
The majority of the Peterson team weren’t listening; they were too busy watching the beautiful woman across the table getting herself off. Jen’s pussy was sore and her nipples hurt but she was entirely focussed on her task, and was only broken from her reverie when she felt a hand on her knee and Clarissa’s voice echoed through her head; “Stop now”.<br />
<br />
Jen instantly obeyed and her cramping hands fell exhausted in front of her, everything around her seemed to be going in slow motion, as though everything were underwater. Sounds were distorted by the blood rushing through her head and her heavy breathing left her chest hurting, she could make out words and sounds from those around her, but could only understand small parts of the conversation.<br />
<br />
“-Well yes, most excellent-”<br />
<br />
“I never realised, bravo-”<br />
<br />
“-Apparatus?-”<br />
<br />
“-and ecstasy node-”<br />
<br />
“-I think that’s a good idea-”<br />
<br />
“-be fine, just resting-“<br />
<br />
“-Brilliant proposition-”<br />
<br />
Jen looked up; the light from the windows hurt her eyes as she watched the silhouettes of Matthew and Mr. Downing shake hands. The other eyes in the room were on her. Clarissa’s hand was slowly caressing her thigh as Jen started to regain focus.<br />
<br />
“That’s excellent, you’re strategy is perfect for this case, we would be happy to accept you as our representation on this issue.” Mr Downing said, “but I’m unconvinced as to the legality of your…”<br />
<br />
“Jen is a toy” Clarissa said, “There are no legality issues Mr. Downing, I assure you”<br />
<br />
“Very well, I will research this case myself and as long as there are no repercussions that could hinder our ability to work together I will draw up the contract and have it delivered by Friday.”<br />
<br />
“It’s been a pleasure gentlemen” Matthew said as the Peterson group began to leave the room. Jen felt a presence behind her as a hand reached inside her teddy and fondled her breast. The touch was rough and she gasped as the hand pinched and twisted her nipple before being withdrawn.<br />
<br />
“We should get ourselves one of these” said the person behind her; Jen recognised it as Mr. Perkins. <br />
<br />
“I’m afraid Jen is a one of a kind, and the only one there will ever be too under the law.” Matthew responded.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Matthew, Clarissa…” Mr. Perkins said as Jen heard them exchange goodbyes as he left the room, leaving her and the two other partners alone in the board room.<br />
<br />
“We did it!” Matthew said, hugging Clarissa warmly and then turning to Jen who was still sitting with her legs wide apart on the small table. “Jen that was brilliant, well done!” he said warmly before walking over to her and giving her a hug. Jen welcomed the embrace and hugged him firmly back. “Clarissa could you take Jen back to her room and put her into storage until tomorrow? I think we’re done for the day”<br />
<br />
“Certainly, Jen…” Clarissa said as she stood holding the board room door open. Jen stood on shaky legs and followed the woman that she thought was her friend back towards what had been her office. “Storage?” Jen asked quietly.<br />
<br />
“Yes, it’s been a long day and you need rest to perform at your best” Clarissa responded as they walked down the hall towards Jen’s office. Jen was terrified as they walked past the office and continued down the corridor.<br />
<br />
“Where are we going?”<br />
<br />
“To storage, did you need to change? Or will you be nude tonight?” Clarissa said as she swiped her key card to open the door that led to the office supplies room for this floor. She held the door open for Jen and gestured for her to walk in front of her.<br />
<br />
“Er…I don’t know” Jen said, now becoming aware that the sexual booster that she’d been given was starting to take effect again.<br />
<br />
 The room was small, and had no windows or natural light sources, it was a cupboard used for the storage of office equipment. There were three photocopiers against one wall and shelves of stationary everywhere else. There was enough room for her and Clarissa to move around but with the door shut it would feel very claustrophobic. Jen was worried about what she was supposed to do in here.<br />
<br />
“Actually, I need to use the bathroom” Jen said, heading towards the door, but it was closed and she didn’t have a key card to open it. Clarissa laughed. “Jen the toilets right there…”<br />
<br />
Jen turned to see her pointing at a small metallic toilet, like the ones they used in prisons, up against the far wall, next to it was a small tissue dispenser. Jen groaned inwardly, “Actually, never mind”.<br />
<br />
“So nude then?” Clarissa said, holding out a hand to take Jen’s clothing. Jen was slow to react but eventually found herself removing her garments and placing them in the woman’s outreached hand. Clarissa grabbed a clipboard and started reading notes off of it.<br />
<br />
“Accounting has asked for your use between 10 and 12 tomorrow morning, they asked for total nudity apart from heels and stockings. I know they like their heels really high so I brought the preparation pair in with me so you can sleep in them tonight and change into the other ones tomorrow morning, that way you won’t be uncomfortable when you put on the pair for the accountants. Ok?” She smiled warmly.<br />
<br />
Jen shivered as she was presented with a pair of 6 inch heels with locks on the straps. Gingerly she put them on and found that the locks clicked shut as soon as she was wearing them. Her feet hurt in these and she was having trouble balancing. Clarissa opened the top of a large crate that was up against the back wall, Jen realised with alarm that the inside was lined with silk.<br />
<br />
Knowing what to do, Jen approached the crate and climbed inside, lying down in the soft lining, the silk felt extremely sensual against her skin and she sighed in comfort, with the weight off her feet the shoes weren’t so uncomfortable. She looked up at Clarissa, who smiled,<br />
<br />
“Night Jen” and with that she closed the lid, leaving Jen in the dark, warm, silky embrace until the following morning.</p>
