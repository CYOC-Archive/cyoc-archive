<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After saying their goodbyes to Francesca (the twins having long since vanished to go entertain themselves), Gemory returned both her and Danielle to the attic of the old house.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Ugh, I never did finish cleaning here, did I?”  Dani looked at all the dust.  “Actually, why are we here?”<br />
<br />
“Technically, I&#39;m not supposed to come to Earth unless summoned.  Part of the Heaven/Hell armistice treaty.  Succcubi and a few other demon types are allowed to make the trip, but definitely not Fallen like myself.  But since I was summoned here, I can come back here as often as I want, unless someone dispels the magic entirely.”<br />
<br />
“Oofta.  Kind of like leaving the back door open, huh?” <br />
<br />
“Pretty much.”  Gemory nodded.<br />
<br />
“A little inconvenient though, isn&#39;t it?  My truck isn&#39;t here.”  Dani pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Well, yeah, we&#39;ll have to set up a circle at your place at some point.  At least until we&#39;re married.  The bonds of unholy matrimony are pretty strong, you would be able to summon me whenever you wanted.”<br />
<br />
“Sort of like a demonic booty call, huh?” Dani chuckled.<br />
<br />
“I mean, unless you want to move in with me in Hell.”<br />
<br />
“It does sound tempting.  I&#39;d be a kept woman, not have to work, have servants attending me 24-7...”<br />
<br />
The two girls looked at each other and laughed.  <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I&#39;d hate it.”  Dani admitted.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s ok honey, I&#39;m perfectly content with you wanting a career.  Have you given any thought to college?”<br />
<br />
Danielle nodded.  “I want to build things.  I thought I&#39;d go into engineering, or try to become an architect.  Barring that, maybe start my own construction company and be a contractor.”<br />
<br />
“Hm.  Interesting.  Well you&#39;re going to live for a long time, so why stop at one dream?  Chase them all!”  Gemory smiled.<br />
<br />
“Live for...oh yeah.  I can make myself younger whenever I want, can&#39;t I?”  Danielle hadn&#39;t considered that!<br />
<br />
“Yep!  And when people start asking the wrong kinds of questions, you could shed a bunch of years and start all over someplace else.  Or even look young enough to claim you&#39;re your own daughter- that&#39;s a classic!”<br />
<br />
Danielle looked thoughtful.  “Or even become a kid again, if I wanted.”<br />
<br />
“Sure, why not?  Though you&#39;re still kind of young, you weren&#39;t a kid all that long ago, right?”  Gemory was curious about this line of thought.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well, Dad used to work all the time, and Mom...I&#39;m not going to into that right now.  I don&#39;t blame Dad one bit, he supported us when Mom was between jobs.  But there are parts of my childhood I&#39;d love to do over.”<br />
<br />
“Well love, anytime you want, I&#39;ll take good care of you.”  Gemory smiled.<br />
<br />
“Thanks.  So I guess I better call an Uber.”<br />
<br />
“Oh I have a better idea.”  Gemory produced a cellphone with a black case.  Danielle didn&#39;t recognize the brand, but it looked very expensive.  The demoness dialed a number and waited.<br />
<br />
<br />
Toni was in love.  She&#39;d never been in love before, unless one counted Gemory, and even then, it was pretty one-sided.  But Amielle...wow, she was amazing.  As a Succubus, she&#39;d had a lot of sex.  Some good, some bad, some amazing.  But nothing could compare to how Ami made her feel!<br />
<br />
She knew that it was impossible, but she wanted to be with the Angel forever.  They were cuddling now after their latest session of lovemaking.  Toni had shown Ami a few new positions- Angels, it turned out, were not very creative.<br />
<br />
They -were-, however, very flexible, and had some amazing talents!  Like being able to alter their size, something Ami had demonstrated when she shrank herself to to 4&#39; tall, curious about what it would feel like to be eaten out at that size.<br />
<br />
Toni was happy to experiment, and she had some...ideas of her own about how to use Ami&#39;s ability.  Just then, her cellphone went off.  Producing it from it&#39;s subspace pocket, Toni answered.<br />
<br />
Ami seemed curious, but kept quiet.<br />
<br />
“Hello?  Oh Boss!  Hey I was worried about you!”  She tried to hide her nervousness.<br />
<br />
“Oh I bet you were, probably afraid the rest of the harem would rip you to shreds without me around, huh?”  Gemory replied, sounding annoyed.  What Toni didn&#39;t know, however, was that Gemory was winking at her fiancee the whole time.<br />
<br />
“Boss, come on, I care about you, it&#39;s not just about saving my own butt.”  <br />
<br />
There was giggling on the other side of the line.  “Just messing with you, Toni dear.  Hey, I need you to do me a favor.  I really could use a ride, do you think you can arrange something for me?”<br />
<br />
“Of course!  When and where!” Toni got the feeling this was going to be a rush job.<br />
<br />
“ASAP, and I&#39;m sending you the address now.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m on my way!” Toni chirped, before Gemory hung up.<br />
<br />
“I take it that was Gemory?” Ami asked, looking too cute for words at her current height.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, she needs me to pick her up and drive her someplace.”  Toni frowned.<br />
<br />
“Can I tag along?”<br />
<br />
That was a -terrible- idea, but the pleading look Ami was giving her completely melted the Succubi&#39;s resolve.  “Sure, you can help me get a car!”<br />
<br />
“Great!”<br />
<br />
<br />
So it was, half an hour later, a red convertible pulled up, driven by a cute redhead in a livery uniform, complete with a cap, who didn&#39;t really look old enough to drive by a few years.  A tiny girl, who was even cuter than the first, with short blonde hair and truly impressive breasts came out to greet them.<br />
<br />
“Wow, Gemory, I&#39;m used to you being a lot taller.  And who is the babe?!” Toni&#39;s eyes were widen, taking in Danielle.<br />
<br />
“Have a little respect for my fiancee, Toni.  She&#39;s the future Duchess of Hell, you know.”  Gemory held up her hand with the engagement ring on it.<br />
<br />
Toni seemed to be the type of girl who wore her emotions on her sleeve, as she went from surprise, to confusion, to, just for a moment, devastation, as if her world had crumbled around her.  She quickly recovered, with an (obviously fake) grin.  “Why, that&#39;s great Boss, congratulations!”<br />
<br />
Toni then went to one knee in front of Danielle.  “And forgive this one&#39;s insolence, your Grace-to-be.  I await my punishment.”<br />
<br />
Danielle looked to Gemory, who just shrugged.  Not sure about the protocol, she knew she had to do -something-, even though she didn&#39;t really want to punish the girl.  Then she had a thought.  She wasn&#39;t sure if she could do this, but having breasts that size couldn&#39;t be comfortable for the tiny girl.<br />
<br />
She touched the top of Toni&#39;s head.  “I wish your breasts were half their current size.”<br />
<br />
With a gasp, Toni felt her heavy tits shrink, leaving her with a much more modest cup size (though, admittedly, still pretty good for a young teen).  Toni looked up at Gemory, her bottom lip quivering.<br />
<br />
“Oh my love, you are cruel!  Toni truly adores her assets!”  Gemory cackled.<br />
<br />
“Oh...no, I&#39;m so sorry, I thought that they looked uncomfortable!”  Danielle was stricken.  “I went too far, I&#39;m sorry!”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s a good punishment.”  Toni said, still looking like she was about to cry.  “If Gemory says I deserve it, then I do.”  Visibly deflated (in more ways than one, now that her blouse sagged in front), she gestured for the girls to follow her to the car.<br />
<br />
“Gem, I really fucked up, please tell me you can fix her?”  Dani felt terrible.<br />
<br />
“Gem?  I like the pet name, love.  In good time, she still has some explaining to do.”  Gemory took her lover&#39;s hand and led her to the car.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ami turned to face Toni as she got in, looking absolutely woeful, and noticed immediately her diminished assets.  “Toni, what happened?”<br />
<br />
Toni just shook her head.  “It&#39;s...it&#39;s fine.  Please just drive wherever she wants to go.”<br />
<br />
Gemory opened the door for Danielle, before getting in herself.  “Well, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve met you before!”, addressing Amielle.<br />
<br />
“Oh hi, I&#39;m Ami!  Toni said you needed a ride!”  Ami took in her passengers.  That they were both very pretty was no surprise, of course.  One was a mortal, and it was rare to see a human girl with such beauty.  As for Gemory, being this close to her was enough to make Ami shiver- she was way out of her league, and she knew it.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Toni has many talents.  But getting an Angel for a chaffeur, she&#39;s outdone herself.”<br />
<br />
Ami gulped.  Busted!  “Oh, I guess you can tell, huh?”<br />
<br />
Danielle blinked.  “Wait, you&#39;re an Angel?  From Heaven and everything?”<br />
<br />
“Yep!  Totally am!  Amielle, at your service, but you can call me Ami.”  The cute Angel replied.<br />
<br />
“Are we in a hurry, dearest?  I really want to ask a few questions here.”  Gemory interjected.<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh, me too.”  Dani nodded.<br />
<br />
“Well I&#39;m not going to tell you.”  Ami stated.  “In fact, we&#39;re not going anywhere until you tell me why Toni is so upset!”<br />
<br />
Toni immediately moved to try and shush Ami, but the plucky Angel was not having it.<br />
<br />
Gemory looked from Angel to Succubus, then back again.  “Wait...Toni, did you seduce an ANGEL?”<br />
<br />
“...not exactly.  I think she seduced me.”  Toni admitted, in a soft voice.<br />
<br />
“It was mutual!” Ami declared.  “Either way, I love her, and I want answers!”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry!  It was my fault!  I didn&#39;t mean to upset her!  Don&#39;t be angry with Gem, I&#39;m the one to blame!”  Danielle pleaded.<br />
<br />
Three pairs of eyes turned to face Danielle, surprised.<br />
<br />
“I know you&#39;re supposed to be enemies, but Gem didn&#39;t do anything, please, punish me if you have to.”  <br />
<br />
“Love, you don&#39;t...” Gemory started to speak, but was cut off.<br />
<br />
“Very well!  Prepare to accept divine judgement!”  Ami stood on the seat of the convertible, despite Toni&#39;s continued attempts to pull her down.  Unfortunately, Angels, even low-ranked ones, are far stronger physically than a Succubus.<br />
<br />
Gemory growled, her eyes glowing.  “Now see here, whelp...”<br />
<br />
“For your punishment, you will have to lick Toni&#39;s pussy until she is satisfied!”  Amielle folded her arms, trying to look like the very image of divine wrath.<br />
<br />
Dani blinked.  “Wait, what?”<br />
<br />
Gemory blinked.  “What?”<br />
<br />
Toni blinked.  “What!?”<br />
<br />
<br />
After about a half an hour of explanations, the story came out.<br />
<br />
“So you were the star of Gem&#39;s harem?  Oh man, and then I came and stole her from you, I&#39;m really sorry, Toni.”  Dani apologized for the 8th or 9th time.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s ok, you didn&#39;t know.  And really...it&#39;s just that she&#39;s been the center of my whole universe for the past ten years.  I...I knew Gemory could never love me...but it&#39;s ok, I love Ami now!”  The Succubus tried to console the mortal girl.  “And the boob thing, well, it&#39;s fine!  Ami says she doesn&#39;t mind them being smaller!”<br />
<br />
Ami nodded.  “Don&#39;t get me wrong, they were quite nice, but I like being able to fit them in my hand.”<br />
<br />
“I haven&#39;t approved this relationship, you know!”  Gemory said, grumpily.<br />
<br />
“Gem, please.  They&#39;re so adorable together!”  Danielle pleaded with her fiancee.<br />
<br />
“Ugh.  Well, that&#39;s true.  But there will be Hell to pay...and Heaven.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done anything God would not approve of.”  Amielle frowned.  “We are commanded to love!  It&#39;s a gift!”<br />
<br />
“I rather doubt God will say anything.  The other Angels, however, definitely will.  You&#39;ll have your wings torn off and be cast out, and become a Fallen.”  Gemory remembered her own Fall too well, millenia later.<br />
<br />
“I..my wings..” Amielle faltered for a moment, but recovered.  “Fine! I can give up flying for Toni!”<br />
<br />
“Ami..no, you love flying.  And your wings are so pretty...”  Toni did start crying now, and Ami was quick to console her.<br />
<br />
“Gem, surely you can do something?” <br />
<br />
Gemory looked at her beloved.  There was so much Danielle didn&#39;t know, or understand.  &#39;She thinks I can do anything.  And whose fault is that, Gemory?&#39;, she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
But she couldn&#39;t refuse those beautiful eyes.  “Fine, fine, I&#39;ll do what I can.”<br />
<br />
Danielle threw her arms around Gemory and kissed her.  “Thank you!”<br />
<br />
“But...you&#39;re still going to have sex with Toni.”  Gemory stated.<br />
<br />
“Uh..wait what?”  Danielle and Toni spoke in unison.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s a divine mandate.  A weak one, to be sure, but since the easiest way to get you out of it would be to kick Amielle&#39;s cute behind straight to Heaven&#39;s Gates, and you want me to help her, you&#39;re stuck for it.”<br />
<br />
“I...uh..I mean, she&#39;s really cute but, I mean, we&#39;re both in a relationship!  It&#39;d be like cheating!”  Danielle protested.<br />
<br />
“Uh..it would, woudln&#39;t it?”  Toni frowned.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t think so.  I&#39;ve had sex with lots of people in Heaven.  And you need to have sex with other people anyways, to feed, Toni.  I won&#39;t be jealous.”  Amielle smiled.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t think you&#39;re the one she&#39;s worried about, Featherbrain.”  Gemory pointed out.  “However, I guess this was a discussion we were going to have to get to sooner or later.  Danielle, monogamy really isn&#39;t a thing a demon is any good at.  But I love you, and if you want us to be completely devoted to one another, I&#39;ll make an oath in Lucifer&#39;s name.”<br />
<br />
“That..that isn&#39;t fair to you, Gem.  And..I mean, you&#39;re the only one I&#39;ve ever been with.  I think I&#39;d like to have sex with other girls...but not if you&#39;re going to light them on fire with your eyes!”<br />
<br />
Ami looked to Toni.  “She can do that?”<br />
<br />
“You better believe it, lover.”<br />
<br />
Amielle looked paler than usual.<br />
<br />
“Hm, how about this then, Danielle.  We can have sex with other people only as long as two conditions are met.  First, we both agree to it.  And second, we do it together.”  Gemory proposed.<br />
<br />
Danielle brightened.  “I like that.  Which means you have to have sex with Toni too.”<br />
<br />
Gemory waved that off.  “I&#39;ve fucked her a bunch of times.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but you&#39;ve always been dominant.  You&#39;ll have to be submissive to her.”  Dani grinned.<br />
<br />
Gemory&#39;s right eye twitched.  “But she&#39;s an employee!  It&#39;s a massive breach of workplace etiquette!”<br />
<br />
“And, because it&#39;s only fair, Toni&#39;s girlfriend has to be there too.”  Danielle offered an olive branch.<br />
<br />
“Ooh!  Don&#39;t worry though, I can be submissive!  I don&#39;t mind at all!”  Amielle snatched the offered branch without a second thought.<br />
<br />
“Hm.  So you, an Angel, will have to please a Duke of Hell?”  Gemory brighened.<br />
<br />
Amielle gulped.  “Uh...yes?”<br />
<br />
“Deal!”<br />
<br />
Toni smacked her forehead, not believing any of this was happening.<br />
<br />
“But can we go meet my Mom first?  I need some closure.”  Danielle asked.<br />
<br />
“Hm.  So what has this woman done, exactly?”  Amielle asked.<br />
<br />
After another twenty minutes of explanations, the Angel had developed an eye twitch of her own, and her golden eyes were shining brightly.  “Unforgivable!  This woman must face divine justice!”<br />
<br />
“On that, little bird, we are in agreement.”  Gemory nodded.<br />
<br />
“Wow.  And I thought my folks were rough on me.  Yeah, let&#39;s get that bitch!”  Toni chimed in.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, girls.  I want to do this myself, but I know I&#39;m going to need backup.  It&#39;s hard for me to stand up to her, even now.”  Danielle was grateful to have a posse, even one that consisted of two Demons and an promiscuous Angel.<br />
<br />
“I will be glad to provide moral support on behalf of Heaven, Danielle.”  Amielle nodded, and adjusted her cap, ready to drive.<br />
<br />
“My, my, my, Heaven and Hell working together.  It&#39;s been awhile since that happened last.”  Gemory grinned.<br />
<br />
Toni hugged her lover.  “You&#39;re amazing, you know that?”<br />
<br />
“Aw, it&#39;s no big deal, I was made to be perfect, after all.”  Ami blushed.<br />
<br />
Gemory rolled her eyes, but Danielle shushed the Duke with a kiss, a silent admonishment to be nice.<br />
<br />
And with that, they were off.</p>
