<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I rose a trembling finger and gently pressed the doorbell. A chime went off, but no one appeared at the door. “Thank God,” I thought. “They’re not home.”<br />
<br />
I turned to leave but just then the door flew open. “Greetings, fellow Homo sapiens,” said a high-pitched, squeaky voice. <br />
<br />
“Oh, uh... hi Trevor,” I replied. “Um, I’m not homosexual. I’m straight.”<br />
<br />
Trevor let out a snort that I guess was supposed to be his laugh. “Homo sapiens are humans, Parker,” he said as if everyone knew that. <br />
<br />
Trevor Stone was the scrawniest boy at Jefferson Middle School, and he’s been picked on for years. However, Trevor was also the smartest boy at Jefferson Middle School. This means he’s been exploited hundreds of times. Trevor has to give in to doing other people’s homework because he knows if he doesn’t then he’ll get bullied.     <br />
<br />
I’m one of those middle kids: not a jock but I’m still pretty muscular. I have pretty average intelligence but I still feel like an idiot around Trevor. <br />
<br />
The only reason I would ever come to his house is because we were paired for a science project. I was fine with it. I mean I knew I was guaranteed an A+, but what really scared me about Trevor... was his dad.<br />
<br />
The man was at least 6’5” and had muscle that rivaled Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s. He was bald and had a neatly trimmed beard. I knew he had been in the military for almost ten years. The fact that Trevor was his son was something I just couldn’t wrap my head around.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go to my room,” Trevor said excitedly. “I have some great ideas for the project.”<br />
<br />
You entered into the mansion that Trevor called his home. A beautiful spiral staircase wrapped around a glistening chandelier. Paisley carpets decorated the floor and family pictures covered the light blue walls. Several hallways branched off, and Trevor led me down the nearest one to our left.<br />
<br />
The hallway was brightly lit and decorated similarly to the foyer. It led to a single red door that I guess was the entrance to Trevor’s bedroom.<br />
<br />
He opened the door and I gazed with wonder at his bedroom. It must have been the size of my living room. Telescopes pointed out the windows, solar systems hung from the ceiling, and constellations were painted on the walls. Several tables were covered with lab equipment: graduated cylinders, vials with various liquids, syringes, and a lot of other stuff I didn’t know the name of. <br />
<br />
I couldn’t deny it. This room was pretty cool. <br />
<br />
“So our assignment is to use a PowerPoint to exhibit the ethical controversy of embryonic stem cell usage, right?” Trevor said. <br />
<br />
“Yeah I think so,” I replied. The teacher had used a lot smaller words. <br />
<br />
“Well I was thinking we could go a step forward. What if we actually used stem cells to show their abilities instead of just writing about them?”<br />
<br />
“Um, yeah I guess that would be cool.”<br />
<br />
“When embryonic stem cells are injected into an organism, they can repair or replace tissue. We’ll just need something to experiment on.” <br />
<br />
“There’s some mice that live around my house. I’m sure I could catch one.”<br />
<br />
“I was thinking of something a little bigger. Mice have been done before.” <br />
<br />
“Oh,” I said, disappointed. <br />
<br />
“What if... what if we tested the stem cells on a human.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think that’d be safe and who would we even get to do it...”<br />
<br />
Trevor was looking at me with a wild gleam in his eyes. He looked at me up and down as if he was inspecting me. “I think you’ll do fine,” he said.<br />
<br />
I screamed and ran out of his bedroom, but at the end of the long hallway was an enormous man. I quickly recognized him as Trevor’s father.<br />
<br />
“Leaving so soon?” he asked. “My son needs that A+.” <br />
<br />
“You know maybe we could do this some other day,” I said, trying to think of an excuse. <br />
<br />
Trevor came out of his room and he and his father each grabbed me by an arm. I thrashed my arms and tried to escape. I managed to release my arm from Trevor’s weak grasp but there was nothing I could do to escape his dad. <br />
<br />
He pushed me forward and steered me down a different hallway. This one led to a gray vault door. Bend it was a staircase that led down into darkness.<br />
<br />
My palms were sweating. “This is how I die,” I thought.<br />
<br />
Trevor’s dad ushered me down the stairs and Trevor locked the vault door behind us. <br />
<br />
Trevor his a light switch and bright fluorescent lights blinded my eyes. I blinked a few times, adjusting to the sudden change. The three of us stood in a cold room twice the size of Trevor’s bedroom. The walls and floor were all cement.<br />
<br />
In front of us was a lab table filled with tools and equipment. Next to the table was a giant vertical cylinder that was as tall as the eight foot ceiling. I was able to make out a door handle on the side of the cylinder. <br />
<br />
Trevor appeared next to me and took a picture of me on his phone.<br />
<br />
“What’s that for?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I’ve gotta have before and after pictures,” he said.<br />
<br />
Then Trevor opened the cylinder and his dad shoved me inside. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t fight. I was helpless.<br />
<br />
The door closed on me and locked. <br />
<br />
I could hear Trevor and his dad flipping switches and hitting buttons on the sides of the machine.<br />
<br />
“Let’s make him look like me,” his dad said. “Huge and muscular.”<br />
<br />
“That would be awesome,” Trevor said. “Can we make him gay too?”<br />
<br />
“Of course!” his dad said excitedly.<br />
<br />
I almost passed out with fear. What were they talking about?<br />
<br />
Suddenly a syringe shot out of the inside wall of the machine. I pressed myself to the opposite wall, terrified of needles, but I couldn’t avoid it. The needle inched closer and then inserted itself into my bicep. Something was injected into me that I could only guess was stem cells.<br />
<br />
The changes began almost immediately, and I tore off my clothes to watch what was happening. My biceps expanded and grew huge. The same thing was happening to my calves and thighs. My bones creaked as I got taller and wider. It was painful at first, but then I started to enjoy it. The growing felt like an orgasm and waves of pleasure washed over me.<br />
<br />
My pecs grew outward and suddenly I had a well-defined six pack. I had muscles larger than The Rock’s, and they were still getting bigger.<br />
<br />
I felt pins and needles all over my body. I was growing hair - everywhere. My chest, arms, and legs were covered with brown fur. It even trailed down my abs and into a thick bush of pubes. I touched my face. I had a beard and a mustache. Then I touched the top of my head and screamed. <br />
I was bald.<br />
<br />
I didn’t dwell on my baldness for long. I was still in immense pleasure and several moans escaped mouth.<br />
<br />
I looked down at my incredible body and noticed my dick. It was growing. It reached upward towards my face. It had to be at least a foot long. My balls hung low and were the size of softballs.<br />
<br />
My body continued to expand and grow. Then suddenly I climaxed. I moaned with pleasure and grabbed my cock as I shot loads of cum all over the interior of the cylinder. <br />
<br />
“That was incredible,” I thought, breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
The door of the machine opened and Trevor and his dad looked at me proudly. The weird thing was I couldn’t take my eyes off of Trevor’s dad. I hadn’t noticed it before but wow was he hot. For the first time I notice his massive package bulging out of his pants. Then I realized: I was gay.<br />
<br />
“This deserves an A+,” Trevor said, snapping a picture of me.”<br />
<br />
“Definitely,” his dad agreed.<br />
<br />
I couldn’t deny it, I felt amazing. Trevor’s dad threw me a towel to wipe the cum off my body then slapped me in the ass.<br />
<br />
“You look hot as fuck,” he told me.<br />
<br />
“Oh, um... thanks,” I replied.<br />
<br />
“Trevor, go finish your project. Parker and I are going to go up to my bedroom and have a little fun.”<br />
<br />
With my new body, I probably could have fought him and escaped. But for some reason I followed him. I had the uncontrollable urge to fuck Trevor’s dad in the ass. <br />
<br />
“This was the best science project I’ve ever been a part of,” I said. <br />
<br />
“Partners for the rest of middle school?” Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
“Partners for life,” I replied. Then I grabbed his dad’s ass and followed him to his bedroom.</p>
