<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clover gave Bill advice: ‘Like I said earlier. Just think of everyone as the bodies they end up in. You won’t go wrong’<br />
<br />
&#39;He&#39;s right&#39; said Jim who had been listening. You need to call me by the name of the body I end up getting. I&#39;ll be calling you Clover&#39;<br />
<br />
The changes up at the tree continued. They were nearly up to Clare. The young woman who had been sitting next to Clare emerged from the room as Peggy, Clover&#39;s Mum. Bill wondered if he was to call this person Mum for the next week.<br />
<br />
Clare meanwhile had found a skirt in her present. She emerged from the bathroom as one of Clovers cousins. The new &quot;Bill&quot; explained that Clare was now &quot;Cheyanne&quot; the young sister of the woman Charlie had become.<br />
<br />
Jim was the last on Bill&#39;s table to go to the tree. He unwrapped a bra. When he came out of the bathroom he was “Clare”. Bill realised Jim would be the person who breastfed Jack for the next week. He understood that swap may have been rigged as well. <br />
<br />
When the new “Clare” returned to the table. She had a huge grin on her face and said to Bill ‘I was hoping this might be the case Sis. I hope Jack wakes soon. I can’t wait to feed him’ Bill supposed she was technically the old Jim’s sister now.<br />
<br />
The older adults at the next table began going to the tree. One of the aunts, the same one who Michelle had become emerged from the room as Uncle Eric. A man who Bill could remember meeting earlier became &quot;Pop&quot;<br />
<br />
Peggy, Clover’s real Mum became “Charlie” and seemed pretty pleased with that outcome. She was followed by Mr Wilson (Richard) who became Clover&#39;s brother &quot;Simon&quot;. He too seemed happy with the outcome. <br />
<br />
The last three to change were the real Eric, Pop and Ma. All became younger. Eric became a son in law while Pop revealed some negligee which was later revealed to belong to Clover’s cousin Chantelle, a 24 year old, who was the girl that had become Peggy. It was quite something to see an old man hobble into the bathroom and a nubile young woman come out doing dance moves in a lacy black number. Her performance elicited a cheer.<br />
<br />
In another coincidence Ma came out as Oscar. The 84 year old great grandmother had become a 30&#39;ish Hispanic man covered in tattoos.<br />
<br />
That was the final change. The new &quot;Eric&quot; tapped a glass stood up and in what seemed to be a rehearsed speech said. &#39;Merry Christmas to everyone. We have all now received our gift for the festive season. Enjoy your week and as we say &quot;Get on with someone else&#39;s life&quot;&#39;<br />
<br />
That prompted the majority of the room to stand up and start to circulate. The chatter level went through the roof. &quot;Clare&quot; the former Jim stood up and start collecting plates she could reach. Clover gave Bill a nudge &quot;That&#39;s your cue &quot;Clover&quot; You need to help out. Collect the empty plates and glasses. Remember a woman&#39;s work is never done&#39; He passed Bill his empty plate.&#39;Just follow the other girls into the kitchen, someone will be running the show and tell you what to do. Find me when you are finished&#39; <br />
<br />
So Bill or &quot;Clover&quot; as everyone was now calling her took her a stack of plates and followed &quot;Clare&quot; to the kitchen. Not used to wearing heels she probably wasn&#39;t the speediest of waitresses. In the kitchen she found a mass of femininity. A woman who had Michelle&#39;s body and whom Bill recalled was one of the in-law aunts told her &#39;Clover, can you stack the glasses into that dishwasher&#39; and to the former Jim &#39;Clare, can you make sure the kid&#39;s table is cleared&#39;<br />
<br />
So &quot;Clover&quot; as she had to get used to thinking of herself was busy for the next ten minutes. With so many helpers the cleanup was remarkably quick. Her main concern was that she didn&#39;t want to spill anything on the dress she was wearing.<br />
<br />
When she was told to &#39;Go and find your fiance&#39; she returned to the room. The tables had been removed and everyone was standing in groups chatting away. She noticed that those who had come out of the bathroom in dressing gowns were now all dressed properly. Jim was now wearing the dress Clare had started the dinner in. She found &quot;Bill&quot; talking to &quot;Charlie&quot; and &quot;Simon&quot; apparently brothers-in -law talking to each other but in reality Clover talking to her parents. Once they spotted her she was given a cuddle from both &quot;Charlie&quot; and &quot;Simon&quot; and told by both how they loved having her in the family.<br />
<br />
They were the first of many people who gave the former a Bill a cuddle that evening. She had trouble recalling who was really who. The woman who was in Peggy&#39;s body told her &#39;Don&#39;t worry about trying to remember who I was. I&#39;m your Mum for the next week. Treat me as you would treat your real mother&#39; That was very good advice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clover&quot; did go over and talk to &quot;Ma&quot; who she did recall was really Oscar. &quot;Ma&quot; was sitting down cuddling one of Oscar and Rose&#39;s toddlers on her lap. &#39;How does it feel to be so old?&#39; she asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s certainly different&#39; the old woman replied. &#39;Little Amy here thinks I&#39;m her great grandma. She&#39;s looking for her Mum. If you see &quot;Rose&quot; could you send her this way&#39;<br />
<br />
While this conversation was happening, little Jack woke and being hungry started to wail. Bill noticed the new &quot;Clare&quot; eagerly run to her baby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clover&quot; politely sat with &quot;Ma&quot; for several more minutes but once &quot;Rose&quot; arrived left to join &quot;Clare&quot;. She found the the former Jim giving Jack a nappy change. Jack was pawing at what he thought was his mother&#39;s breasts. &quot;Clare&quot; had a big grin on her face as she saw &quot;Clover&quot;. &#39;Young Jack is impatient for a feed. That makes two of us. I now know what Clare means when she complains of having full breasts. They need to be sucked&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Do you mind if I watch?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Not at all. We are sisters now. Would you actually mind putting Jack&#39;s jumpsuit back on him. I need to work out how to undo this top. I&#39;ve seen Clare do it plenty of times but clearly didn&#39;t pay enough attention&#39;<br />
<br />
As Bill got Jack dressed the young fellow was distressed that Mum&#39;s breasts were no longer close by. His little hand groped for next best which were the mounds now attached to Bill&#39;s chest. He wanted to get to the breasts that the baby sensed were under that material. It was a new feeling for the new &quot;Clover&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clare&quot; was now seated and had manged to undo the maternity bra exposing engorged breasts. &quot;Clover&quot; handed the baby to &quot;Clare&quot; and Jack did the rest. He quickly attached himself to a nipple and went to work.<br />
<br />
&#39;So how does it feel?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Incredible. I love this time of year. I love being Clare. I love being in this family&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I think I&#39;m starting to agree with you. This isn&#39;t something I ever dreamed of experiencing&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You will have the time of your life&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Jim. Can I ask you something?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m Clare now. But yes ask away&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Do you think &quot;Bill&quot; will expect to have sex with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Hell yeah! Don&#39;t you want to have sex? It&#39;s incredible having sex as a woman. Do not miss the opportunity&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m frightened of the idea. Does it hurt? Will it make me gay?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;It doesn&#39;t hurt if you are ready and I would be pretty sure that &quot;Bill&quot; knows how to please that body. And all I will say is that I enjoy sex with Clare no matter what body I&#39;m in&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;What happens when you are both guys?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;We were last year. Yeah we shared a bed and kissed but didn&#39;t take things further than that. I felt uncomfortable. This year we are both female. I&#39;d be happy to experiment but not if it makes Clare or should I say Cheyanne uncomfortable. It&#39;s only 1 week. That&#39;s my recommendation to you. When you are in bed with &quot;Bill&quot; go with your feelings. If you are uncomfortable with anything tell him. He will respect you&#39;</p>
