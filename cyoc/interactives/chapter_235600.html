<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Jungle King&#39;s hand remained raised as he began to chant, his deep voice vibrating through the humid air like a storm rolling in from the horizon. The strange, ancient words echoed around the clearing, their meaning lost to Brett, but their power unmistakable. As the incantation reached its peak, Brett felt an odd sensation spreading through his body, a tingling that began in his chest and rippled outward like waves in water.<br />
<br />
At first, it was subtle—an itch beneath his skin, a faint pressure as though his muscles were swelling from within. Brett’s heart raced, the adrenaline surging through his veins. He took a step back, his boots sinking into the soft earth, but there was nowhere to run. The Jungle King&#39;s eyes locked onto him with a glint of satisfaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;What… what are you doing to me?&quot; Brett growled, his deep voice faltering, edged with fear. He tried to resist, to fight the strange force overtaking him, but it was like trying to stop a tidal wave with his hands.<br />
<br />
The tingling intensified, spreading across his broad chest. Brett glanced down in shock as he saw dark hair thickening across his skin, far denser than before. His chest, already hairy and rugged, now grew a pelt of fur that extended to his arms and shoulders. His once-tan skin darkened, taking on a coarse, leathery texture. He gasped, his chest expanding, muscles bulging unnaturally, as though his body was being reshaped from the inside out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it!&quot; Brett demanded, his voice trembling as panic crept in. He tried to reason with the Jungle King, but the words came slower, clumsier, his mind fogging like a window clouding over with steam. &quot;I… I came here… to—&quot;<br />
<br />
The Jungle King chuckled darkly, lowering his hand slightly, watching with amusement as the transformation took hold. &quot;You came here seeking the truth,&quot; he said, his voice rich with condescension. &quot;And now you will learn the truth of your own nature. You’re not the first strong man to come into my realm, Brett Baxter. And you won’t be the last to fall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett’s legs began to thicken, his pants straining under the growing mass of muscle. He groaned, a low, guttural sound escaping his throat, his powerful thighs growing shorter, stubbier, as his boots split apart, revealing feet that were warping into thick, calloused hands. His arms, once sinewy and human, extended unnaturally, fingers lengthening into long, powerful digits tipped with blunt nails.<br />
<br />
&quot;No…&quot; Brett mumbled, his voice slurring as his lips grew thicker, his jaw protruding forward into a brutish muzzle. He shook his head, trying to fight off the dizziness, the fog overtaking his mind. &quot;I’m… I’m a man…&quot;<br />
<br />
But even as he tried to form the words, his mind was slipping away, each thought slower, heavier, like trying to move through thick mud. The world seemed distant now, his senses heightening in strange ways—the rich, earthy scent of the jungle became overwhelming, the sounds of the wildlife sharper, more immediate. His mouth filled with the taste of copper and earth as his tongue thickened, teeth growing into large, blunt fangs.<br />
<br />
Brett&#39;s shoulders hunched forward as his spine elongated, his back curving into a powerful hunch. His once-human hands curled into massive fists, knuckles scraping the ground. His deep blue eyes, once sharp and intelligent, dulled as they widened, the spark of human understanding flickering out like a dying flame. Fur now covered his entire body, thick and dark, making him look more like the very beasts he had spent his life studying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please…&quot; Brett tried to beg, his voice little more than a deep, primal grunt. His throat tightened, his vocal cords thickening, reducing his once-commanding voice to nothing more than inarticulate sounds. His mind reeled as he tried to cling to some semblance of humanity, but the thoughts became jumbled, fractured. Words meant nothing now. Concepts meant nothing. His world was shrinking into something more primal, more instinctual.<br />
<br />
The Jungle King stood before him, towering over Brett’s diminishing form with a wide, satisfied grin. &quot;Look at you now,&quot; he taunted, his voice dripping with amusement. &quot;The great Brett Baxter, a mighty explorer… now reduced to a dumb, grunting ape.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett growled, his mouth hanging open, drool pooling at the edges as he fought to understand what was happening. He beat his fists against the ground, the strength in his new form undeniable, but it was the mind of a beast that now controlled him. His once-proud human thoughts were all but gone, replaced with simple, animalistic urges—the need to survive, the hunger to feed, the instinct to dominate his territory.<br />
<br />
The Jungle King circled him, laughing. &quot;You came here with your clever mind and your strong body, thinking you could conquer the unknown. But now look at you—nothing more than a hairy brute, a dumb animal. This is your place in my realm, Brett. Not as a man, but as a beast. You will roam this jungle for the rest of your days, forgotten by the world, forgotten even by yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett&#39;s vision blurred, his blue eyes clouded with confusion. He tried to remember who he was, what he had been before, but all that remained was a dull, animalistic understanding of the world around him. He beat his chest with powerful, thick arms, letting out a deep, primal roar that echoed through the jungle.<br />
<br />
The Jungle King watched with a smirk, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction. &quot;Welcome to my kingdom, Brett. Welcome to your new life.&quot;</p>
