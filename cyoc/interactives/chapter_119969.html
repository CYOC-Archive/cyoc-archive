<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;My god he just looks wrecked.  It&#39;s like he&#39;s exhausted both mentally and physically&quot;  Tristan said.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s take him back to my place and see if alleviate whatever is going on here.&quot;  Park said.  Park had admit Kenji probably looked cute when he was healthy.  He could see the attraction.  &quot;Here..put him on my back and I&#39;ll carry him.&quot;  Park said.  The twins came and gently put Kenji on Park&#39;s back.  Park took Kenji&#39;s arms and held them so he wouldn&#39;t fall off. <br />
Jae leaned in and kissed Park &quot; You really are amazing babe.  I kind of like this side of you.&quot;<br />
As they headed to Park&#39;s house, everyone chatting about what they could remember from their recent transformation...Suddely Park heard Kenji whisper into his ear &quot;I&#39;m so sorry&quot; before passing out again.  Park was wondering why no one remembered Kenji after he reverted back from the Coach.  He was curious as to why Kai and Solomon were still 16.  Jae noticed this also but decided to take things one at a time.<br />
When they got to Park&#39;s house, Park laid Kenji on his bed and covered him with a blanket.  Jae brough some Gatorade and got Kenji to drink.  They left him to rest and hopefully recover his strength.  They went downstairs to join everyone.  They were all hungry so Park and Jae grabbed some leftovers from the fridge and made a couple of dishes.   It was about an hour later that everything was done.  As everyone was about to eat, Kenji slowly made his way into the room and weakly said, &quot;Wow!  That smells amazing.&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get you a plate and something to drink, but I&#39;m gonna take you to sit down.&quot; Luca said, putting Kenji&#39;s arm around his shoulders and guiding him to the couch.<br />
After everyone filled their plates they all went to the living room.  Finally Kenji exhaled, the fog in brain slowly clearing and asked &quot;Uh guys...why do I remember waking up in the football coach&#39;s office and how did I get here?&quot;  <br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me!&quot; Silas said angrily.  &quot;Are you kidding me?  You&#39;ve got to be kidding me.&quot;  Tristan placed his had over his brother&#39;s mouth saying &quot;You seriously need to learn patience and anger management little brother&quot;<br />
&quot;You seriously don&#39;t know?&quot; Park asked.<br />
&quot;The last thing I remember was getting a game mailed to me.  I played with it on my iPad after showering after practice.  I remember I was waiting on a ride so I thought I&#39;d see what the game is all about.  I remember being amazed at how detailed it was.  It was some sort of next gen sims game.  I saw Bobby Miner&#39;s name so I decided it would be fun to create a character that would put him in his place.  I remember looking at the time and realizing my ride was about to be there so I saved the game and started to get dressed. When I touched the locker I got zapped.  After that all I remember was being in a dark place and it took all I had to fight off this coach character I created.&quot; Kenji said in a soft voice.<br />
&quot;Maybe if we looked at his copy of this program we can get some answers.  Where&#39;s your iPad?&quot; Luca asked.  Kenji motioned to his book bag next Luca.  Luca emptied out all of the contents.  &quot;There&#39;s nothing here except school stuff.  And we checked your locker to make sure we had everything and there were some clothes and your toiletries.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you remember if there were options like &#39;unaware of changes&#39; or &#39;adapt to new reality&#39; or anything like that on your copy of Maker?&quot;  Jae asked.<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?  What is &#39;maker&#39;. And is this really the date?  Like I said it was like Sims, there were 2 buttons Save and Cancel.  What is going on here?&quot;  Kenji said starting to get stressed.<br />
&quot;Maker is a program that allows the user to change reality - like anything.&quot;  Jae said<br />
&quot;I wonder...why send Kenji an incomplete version?  How did they know he would create someone like coach ken Nolan?  And then why use him to change us?&quot;  Park asked to no one in particular.<br />
Incensed, Kenji angrily said &quot;So someone sent me this half baked program and not only took my heritage but made me into grows old white fuck??  Yo!  I want my pound of flesh!&quot;<br />
&quot;We first need to figure out who&#39;s got beef with us and why?&quot;  Jae said.  <br />
&quot;They obviously know who we once were...&quot;  Park surmised <br />
&quot;Who you once were?&quot;  Kenji asked.<br />
Jae explained everything that happened, how people got changed and also the fact that they knew about these changes and liked who they had become.<br />
&quot;Did you change me?&quot;  Kenji asked cautiously.<br />
&quot;Actually you were the inspiration for my change because I had a crush on you.  That changed with Park, plus the fact that you&#39;re straight.  You are straight, right?&quot;  Jae said<br />
&quot;Yes...still straight.  It&#39;s weird because I remember when the 2 of you came out to me, it was freshman year.  It&#39;s weird having half the soccer team gay.  I remember some of the guys making fun of me because I preferred hanging out with you guys.  I remember growing up together.  And I now know those memories are fake but they feel so real.&quot;  Kenji said.<br />
&quot;Back to the matter at hand, the clues seem to be all there - it&#39;s someone who hates either the soccer team or just us, loves football and knows who we used to be&quot;. Park said<br />
&quot;Can it be that simple?&quot; Kai suddenly spoke up.  &quot;The pool of suspects is not going to be small.  Based on people who love football, who hate the soccer team, hate our entire crew or some of us individually.  This is not going to be easy to figure out. &quot;<br />
As Jae paced, he looked at his reflection in the mirror out of the corner of his eye and noticed something.  He had gotten slightly more buff and toned.  You wouldn&#39;t really notice if you didn&#39;t see the person often.  He looked around and noticed that it wasn&#39;t just him.  There were similar small changes in everyone except Park.  He asked Park &quot;Did you do this?&quot; He gestured to his slightly bigger pecs, arms, thighs and calves.  &quot;How did you beat him?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be the first to own up to that...especially those changes&quot; Park said, running his fingers down Jae&#39;s abs and into his pants.  &quot;I beat him by hacking into his computer first.  I made so that when he tried to change me it would backfire and bring Kenji back.  Then I programmed by maker to allow me to use certain words to protect myself, like sleep.  I also set it so that when the coach tried to change me, my maker would automatically change everyone back.  Then it was just a matter of pissing him off to the point that he&#39;d want to change me.  The weird thing was Kenji&#39;s profile was not on that computer.  I only discovered he even existed through your profile.  He&#39;s as much of a victim as anyone here&quot; At this point Park had a mischievous smile, which drove Jae wild.<br />
&quot;Was there anything that might help us?&quot; Jae asked.<br />
&quot;Nothing yet.  I&#39;m going through some of these emails that I got off coach&#39;s computer before the change caused it to disappear.&quot; Park said<br />
&quot;Take all the time you need and let me know.&quot; Jae said</p>
