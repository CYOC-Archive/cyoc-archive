<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elizabeth watched the morning sun rise through the window blinds and listened to the birdsong playing outside. <br />
<br />
Laying here in Maria&#39;s bed, with a warm body snuggled up against her, it felt nice. Safe.<br />
<br />
One thing that the two born women had in common with each other was that they had both been fighting a losing battle against their sexualities. <br />
<br />
Maria, because her religious upbringing had taught her to find homosexuality abhorrent, and her conservative nature viewed the increasingly public displays of carnality among women both born and new disgusting.  <br />
<br />
Elizabeth, because she was still hanging on to feelings for her former husband. She wasn&#39;t homophobic like Maria had been, but for years, she had been in deep denial about her (not so new anymore) attraction to women. <br />
<br />
Whenever she had made love to Robbie, Elizabeth imagined that she was having sex with her husband. She imagined that deep down, the man who she had fallen in love with and gotten married to was still buried under that blonde haired sexpot somewhere, behind the nymphomania and youthful immaturity. <br />
<br />
Until very recently, Elizabeth couldn&#39;t accept that she had been lying to herself and that Robbie was essentially a completely different person from the man she had once been.  Not a bad person, really. Not even someone whom Elizabeth particularly disliked. Just not her husband. <br />
<br />
Ever since the divorce, Elizabeth was trying to come to terms with the fact that her life for the past six years had drastically changed, even more than most women. <br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t run from the truth anymore, she was alone in this world. She had to create a new life for herself, all on her own. <br />
<br />
Maria woke up a few minutes later. She noticed that she had been fondling Elizabeth&#39;s breast with her weathered hand. She chuckled in modest embarrassment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry&quot; the Filipina said sheepishly, looking into Elizabeth&#39;s pretty eyes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to come to church with me?&quot; she asked Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
President Rodham poured herself a drink. <br />
<br />
Today was going to be a bad day. <br />
<br />
Hot girl summer? More like riot girl summer. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;This is utter fucking bullshit!&quot; Millie screamed, her white hot rage awakening Juliana from a sound slumber right next to her in bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, babe?&quot; Juliana yawned.<br />
<br />
Millie was holding her smart phone in her hands. She had the &quot;furious&quot; look in her eyes, which was always bad news. <br />
<br />
Unless they were fucking. Angry Millie was always the best in bed. Outside of sex though, it meant that she was on the warpath. <br />
<br />
Millie shoved her phone in her wife&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Motherfucking Roe v Wade just got overturned, that&#39;s what!! Can you fucking believe it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliana, who wasn&#39;t really tuned in to political stuff as much as Millie was, but knew that this was something not good, nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s pretty awful, honey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awful? How the everliving fuck can this shit still be happening when there&#39;s no men around anymore?! You&#39;d think that women would be better than this, but no! These Republican cunts *still* want to control everyone&#39;s lives! I fucking hate those bitches on the Supreme Court!&quot;<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Lucretia, a born woman, screamed in primal rage at the news, just as Millie across town was currently doing. She tried calling up Robbie just to have someone to vent to about it, but Robbie was still asleep after an exhausting day of playing with her kids, having taken them out on various &quot;funtivities&quot; during her visitation day. <br />
<br />
Lucretia threw a shoe across the room. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Shelly and Carrie were at Shelly&#39;s home. They had spent the entire night together watching movies, snuggled up against each other, mindlessly eating popcorn. <br />
<br />
They had been together as a couple for years now, and they were pretty thoroughly in love, just as they had been as boy and girl. <br />
<br />
Currently, the two were watching Jennifer&#39;s Body, a film which had bombed when it had come out in 2009, but had become something of a cult classic in the years since, and especially after The Great Change, due to the its two female bisexual leads and quirky mix of humor and horror. <br />
<br />
The scene where Jennifer Check is kidnapped by Low Shoulder, the film&#39;s villains, in order to be sacrificed to Satan, was extremely triggering to Shelly. It reminded her of her own kidnapping, but she worked through the scene and avoided having a panic attack, especially with Carrie there to comfort her. <br />
<br />
The ending of the movie, where Jennifer is avenged by her (ex) bestie Needy, was very cathartic to Shelly, reminding her of how she had been forced to kill her own abductor, and the sense of relief that she had felt from finally being free after a decade of being tortured. <br />
<br />
Carrie never asked Shelly what it was like to have to kill someone in self defense. She knew that question was best left unanswered, and that it was best to just love Shelly unconditionally.</p>
