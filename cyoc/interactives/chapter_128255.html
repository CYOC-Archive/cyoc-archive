<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what,&quot; you say. &quot;If you teach me how to actually walk in these things, we&#39;ll go to the mall and go shopping. You can even see how your clothes look without having to try them on yoursellf,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you&#39;re clever, don&#39;t you? You won&#39;t be trying on any pants while we&#39;re there,&quot; Brooke says matter-of-factly. &quot;You&#39;re just begging for sore feet today, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well when I win your little challenge - not if, when - the first thing you&#39;re doing is giving me a nice, long foot massage like I always give you. The other thing I want to do is going to have to wait until next week though,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Brooke raises an eyebrow. &quot;Oh really? And what would we be doing next week?&quot; She asks with piqued interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we&#39;ll get there,&quot; you say with a wink. &quot;There&#39;s something I still have to buy anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something from the mall?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would be both surprised and concerned if they sold this particular thing anywhere in the mall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh rreeeeeeaaaaallllllllyyyyy,&quot; she says, obviously interested. &quot;Well then you&#39;re on! But I still highly doubt you&#39;re going to last all day in those shoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just you wait,&quot; you say as you stand up. &quot;Now come on, teach me the super powers I need to walk in these things.&quot; Brooke chuckles at that, and stands up too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; she starts. &quot;The first thing is to stand up straight, and lean back just a little. You want just a little more weight on your heel than your toes. It helps with both your balance and your confidence as you walk.&quot; You follow her directions, and already feel slightly more balanced.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t want to try and take regular sized steps in heels, but don&#39;t take baby steps either,&quot; she continues. &quot;Maybe, two thirds of a regular step, give or take. Don&#39;t be afraid to take a little more time to get where you&#39;re going if you need to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; you say with a nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure your steps land heel to toe, just like regular walking,&quot; she says. &quot;You don&#39;t want to try and tip toe while you&#39;re leaning back, and putting your whole foot down at once looks and feels awkward. When you&#39;re walking, don&#39;t watch your feet unless you have to, like if you&#39;re on a really uneven sidewalk or something. When you watch your feet you lean forward, which throws off your balance. Try to focus more on where you&#39;re going than what you&#39;re doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense,&quot; you say. &quot;Stand up straight, lean back, smaller steps, take my time, heel to toe, try not to look down...&quot; you say, trying to make sure you&#39;ve got it all. &quot;Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try to keep your foot arched slightly - pushing down with your toes. It&#39;ll help keep the shoe closer to your foot which helps your balance a bit. Aside from that, it&#39;s just practice really,&quot; Brooke says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; you say. &quot;Let me try.&quot; You focus on your bedroom door down the hallway, trying to remember everything she said. You almost stumble on your first couple of steps, but you manage to make it the rest of the way rather smoothly. Turning around when you reach the door, Brooke smiles at you and gives a little clap of approval.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad babe,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I got this,&quot; you say as you start to walk back down the hall. When you get back to where you first were, you put your hand on your hip and strike a pose, flipping your hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Work it gurl!&quot; Brooke says, snapping her fingers fabulously. You giggle and snap your fingers in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go get ready babe, and let&#39;s do this thing,&quot; you say. Brooke nods and heads towards the bedroom. As she passes you, she reaches down and gives your ass a firm grab. Letting out a yelp, you pick up a pillow off the couch and throw it at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say baby?&quot; She asks with a laugh. &quot;You make my ass look good!&quot;<br />
<br />
You give her a half amused, half confused look with your hand on your hip, and she shrugs with a smirk on her face as she walks backwards towards the door. You roll your eyes and shake your head as she disappears into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
While you wait, you decide to practice walking some more. Starting slow, you take a short lap around the living room, focusing on everything Brooke said. After your lap, you decide a lap around the whole house couldn&#39;t hurt. You make one, two more laps, feeling pretty confident in yourself - although considering Brooke&#39;s body already knows how to walk in heels, it&#39;s not like you&#39;re some high fashion prodigy. Halfway through your third lap around the house, Brooke emerges from the bedroom. She walks up to you and hands you her purse, filled with her phone, wallet, keys, rescue inhaler, make up, breath mints, tissues, loose change, and various feminine products.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around a sec,&quot; she says. You turn around and feel Brooke&#39;s hands gathering up all of your hair. In one swift motion she ties it all up in a tight ponytail, leaving hardly a hair out of place. She spins you around to get a better look at you, smiling at her handiwork. &quot;New and improved with 50% more slut,&quot; she smirks. You give her a playful push, but pull out her phone to see how it looks anyway. You turn on the selfie camera to inspect yourself, and in the corner of the screen you see Brooke&#39;s face - or rather, your face - going crosseyed and sticking her tongue out. You roll your eyes and snap a picture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh can&#39;t take this boy anywhere&quot; you caption the photo, uploading it to Brooke&#39;s Facebook and Instagram accounts. She was right though, the ponytail absolutely helps your slut look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you should drive today,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re right,&quot; Brooke says, grabbing your keys off the hook. You walk outside and Brooke follows, locking the door behind you. As you walk out to the car, Brooke passes you, purposely taking larger steps. At first you think she&#39;s just giving you crap about the heels, until she gets to the car and opens the passenger door for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why thank you kind sir,&quot; you say, blushing a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; she says, bowing her head. Normally you hate when guys use that word, but coming from Brooke in your body, it&#39;s actually kind of cute. You climb into the car, almost grinning from ear to ear. Brooke shuts the door and gets in the driver&#39;s seat.<br />
<br />
The ride to the mall is relatively short, only about 10 minutes in traffic. Neither of you say much during the ride, but you hold hands the whole trip like you always do. You spend most of that time admiring your legs and feet, wondering if Brooke will be able to look past her perceived imperfections about herself once this is all over.<br />
<br />
&quot;So uh, we can&#39;t park near the food court,&quot; Brooke speaks up as she makes the turn onto the ring shaped road around the mall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why for because?&quot; You ask in a silly tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you remember Jake?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean that dick licking piece of shit frat boy you dated that tried to hit you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the one,&quot; Brooke says with a sigh. &quot;His sister Kylie told Jenny who told Krista who told me that he&#39;s GMing the Subway here now. And he&#39;s dating some bitch at Victoria&#39;s Secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll fucking kill him if I see him,&quot; you say, clenching your fists and teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby calm down,&quot; she says calmly, pulling into a parking space in front of Macy&#39;s and putting her hand on your leg. &quot;We&#39;re just going to stay away from the food court today, alright? Trust me, I don&#39;t like him either - and I know it would get ugly really quickly if we saw him under regular circumstances. But we don&#39;t need to take any chances while we&#39;re like this. Promise me if we do run into him you&#39;ll behave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I hate him,&quot; you say shortly, crossing your arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. Now promise me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You let out a slow, angry sigh. &quot;Fine, I promise to behave if I see that cock sucking son of a-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll behave! I promise,&quot; you say, holding up a pinky. Brooke looks at you with a twinge of anger and concern, but locks her pinky with yours. It may seem childish to most, but Brooke still takes pinky promises very seriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. You know how much I get worked up over that douchebag.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know baby. But not today, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not today,&quot; you say, offering a little smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, she says again. You both open the doors and get out. You meet Brooke behind the car, and hold hands as you begin walking across the parking lot into the mall.<br />
<br />
As you walk, you feel like you have to rush to keep up with Brooke. Not only are her legs now much longer than yours, but you have to take several much shorter steps in your heels with your much shorter legs. Brooke looks down at you and tries not to laugh. You give her a playfully angry look as the automatic doors open.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s still relatively early, so there aren&#39;t many people in the mall. Walking into Macy&#39;s, you don&#39;t see anyone yet. Rows and rows of clothes, with some upbeat modern music playing quietly through the speakers in the ceiling. It&#39;s almost spooky how quiet it is - your breathing and the click-clack of your shoes are the loudest sounds filling your ears. Brooke leads you through the store and into the large open walkways of the mall itself. There are a few people scattered about, but nothing close to the huge crowd you&#39;d expect from a mall this size.<br />
<br />
Brooke gives you a gentle nudge as you approach Victoria&#39;s Secret. You look up at her with mild curiosity. &quot;You want to go in there?&quot; You ask, sounding a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well sure,&quot; Brooke says. &quot;You did say you would try on clothes so I can see how they look on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah, but I was thinking more along the lines of JC Penny or something,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, you&#39;re not nervous, are you?&quot; Brooke says with a wicked grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m not!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, you totally are!&quot; Brooke laughs. &quot;What could you possibly have to be nervous about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not nervous! I just don&#39;t want to try on lingerie is all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe. You may be in my body, but you&#39;re still a horrible liar,&quot; Brooke says, stopping and standing in front of you. &quot;Seriously, what&#39;s going on? We&#39;ve gone in there before and it wasn&#39;t a big deal then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, but Payton wasn&#39;t working there before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, who?&quot; Brooke raises an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember I told you about that girl I dated in high school and into college?&quot; You look down, trying not to think too hard about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;HER?&quot; Brooke looks shocked. &quot;You mean the one that dumped you because she thought she was &#39;missing out on real life&#39; by only ever having one boyfriend? THAT one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then you have to go in there, you have to tell her off!&quot; Brooke leans in and quiets her voice a bit. &quot;You don&#39;t have to hold back either. You can knock her fucking lights out if you want to. You&#39;re a girl too now, it won&#39;t look as bad if you hit her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, I can&#39;t do that,&quot; you sigh. &quot;Sure, she broke my heart, but I don&#39;t hate her. Besides, I thought we were playing nice around our exes today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on,&quot; Brooke says. &quot;We can kick Jake&#39;s ass whenever. But this is your one chance to get back at her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it, no,&quot; you say, putting your foot down both metaphorically and literally. When your foot connects to the floor, you start to realize just how sore your feet are already becoming. &quot;It took me a long time to move on from her, and it&#39;s just not worth it... Two or three years ago, maybe, but not now. And plus, it&#39;s not really my only chance - just my only chance this week,&quot; you say with a tiny smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Brooke says. &quot;I will make you confront her eventually, though, whether you&#39;re in my body or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t even know what I would say after all this time, honestly,&quot; you say. &quot;Like, &#39;Hey, remember me, you broke up with me a long ass time ago, so fuck you, bye&#39;? I mean, what good does that do? And what if she tries to send her boyfriend after me or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you haven&#39;t noticed, you&#39;re freaking gigantic. I&#39;m sure you could take whatever pipsqueak she sends your way,&quot; Brooke smiles at you. &quot;Do you know who it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, some dude that works at - oh my god,&quot; you have a sudden realization.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember how you said Jake is dating some bitch that works at Victoria&#39;s Secret?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Brooke&#39;s eyes widen when she realizes where your train of thought is going. &quot;Holy shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our exes are dating each other,&quot; you say, nodding slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, we have to fuck with them somehow,&quot; Brooke says with a wicked grin. &quot;The only question is how?&quot;<br />
<br />
You both stand there, thinking for a few moments. You look at Brooke, who begins pacing back and forth, making your body take long strides. Then you look up at the Victoria&#39;s Secret poster adorned with lingerie-clad hotties. Then back at Brooke. Lingerie. Brooke. Lingerie. Suddenly, an idea hits you like a freight train, and you cover your mouth to keep from bursting out laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Brooke asks curiously. You manage to calm yourself just long enough to get your idea out, maintaining a huge grin on your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you run home and grab the bracelets?&quot;</p>
