<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It worked!&quot; Max happily said while he watched the colossal brother sitting on the beach and hugging each other. &quot;Noah is sleeping. Can you turn him back to normal now, Sam?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot; Sam replied while she already was using the Chronivac. &quot;Oh no, there is a problem, guys. We got rid of the nuclear power thing but this device has another problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Ricky asked while he stayed on the driver&#39;s seat and looked at his phone. &quot;Are you going to tell us they&#39;re stuck like that? Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly.&quot; Sam said. &quot;Look, this thing has three changes registered on its history...<br />
<br />
Noah: turned into a giant naked teenager.<br />
Noah: turned into a 35 years old man.<br />
Alex: turned into a clothed giant.<br />
<br />
..But this thing is a beta version and can only undo two of them.&quot; Sam said with a concerned look at her face. She briefly stared at Max and Ricky who had similar expression on their faces. &quot;I can choose which ones I want to erase but one of those is going to be permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; Max shouted. &quot;We can&#39;t turn things completely back to normal? That&#39;s bullshit!&quot; He looked up at his best friend and his former baby brother now turned into a giant naked grown man. &quot;Fine, then let&#39;s undo the giant thing right now. That&#39;s our main problem. We can deal with the 35 year old man later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.&quot; Sam replied while she made the necessary configurations on the device. A few seconds later, both Alex and Noah began to shrink down into normal sizes. Each time they decrease a few feet, a light silhouette stayed for an instant before it vanished. After several minutes they&#39;re back to normal, almost...<br />
<br />
&quot;You did it, Sam.&quot; Alex said with a grin on his face. However when he noticed that his baby brother was still a grown man his look changed completely. Sam and Max explained what was the problem with the Chronivac and how they decided to shrink them down firstly. &quot;I can&#39;t have a 35 years old man as a baby brother, my parents are going to freak out! Noah is going to freak out again when he wakes up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Ricky said to get his friends&#39; attention. Then he looked at Sam. &quot;You told us you can only undo two changes, right?&quot; Sam nodded. &quot;But you didn&#39;t say you can&#39;t transfer one of those changes to another subject, didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam checked in the Chronivac and instantly smiled when she realized that she can do what Ricky said. The name on the remaining change was Noah, but she can put another name she wanted and transfer the change to that person.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do it, right?&quot; Ricky said when he noticed Sam&#39;s smile. &quot;Now, we only need to decide who is going to take those years from Noah.&quot; Sam and Max looked at each other, not sure if they want to volunteer for something like that. Looking at the giant naked man still sleeping in his brother&#39;s arm made them notice how much he had changed by turning into a grownup.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to do it.&quot; Alex said and everyone turned to look at him. &quot;Noah could wake up in any moment and he will freak out again if he sees himself as a grown man. I can&#39;t let my baby brother suffering that again. So, I will take his change in his place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Alex.&quot; Sam whistled. &quot;You almost sound like a hero and not the pathetic shrimp you use to be.&quot; Alex frowned, he didn&#39;t like Sam&#39;s words, but he wasn&#39;t doing this for her, nor him, he was doing it for his baby brother. &quot;Ok, it&#39;s set. I just need to hit apply.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone turn their attention to Noah who was immediately covered in a dim light while he was rejuvenating. His old height was quickly decreasing at the same time his muscles were fading away. The big amount of body hair sunken in his skin while his baby fat returned to where it was before. He went from grown man, to young man, to teenager, to preteen, to kid, toddler and finally a baby.<br />
<br />
Despite they watched it with their own eyes, it was still hard to believe that baby was so big a moment ago and had caused so much destruction. However, they did have little time to think about it, because the light that was covering Noah turned into an orb that moved into Alex who was astounded when the light went inside him.<br />
<br />
He started to glow, and he tried to stand up to get a more comfortable position. Max helped him taking sleeping baby Noah in his arms while all of them keep watching Alex&#39;s transformation. For a moment nothing happened and everyone was wondering why, until a sudden blast of air blinded them momentarily.<br />
<br />
When they can see again, they noticed that instead of a 14 years old Alex was a 35 years old version of him. This time his clothing didn&#39;t change with him, so now it was tattered all around his bigger frame. His bigger shoulders had ripped off the fabric on his armpits and two big bushes were protruding from there.<br />
<br />
His pants now barely reached his knees and because of his thicker thighs, the seams had ripped off exposing some of his new and dense leg hair. Something similar happened to his sneakers which were now destroyed because of his bigger adult feet whose hairy toes were visible on the front.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, guys. You look so small.&quot; Alex said and everyone, including him got surprised of how different he sounds now. He tried to make a step but his pants were so constricted that his butt&#39;s seam ripped off, his button flew off and his zipper broke and pulled down. No one said a word, but Alex&#39;s big bulge was obscenely coming out, it was barely contained in his blue boxer briefs whose fabric was stretched to it&#39;s limits and it can&#39;t covered the thick bush of pubes above it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex, you look... different.&quot; Sam blushed when she realized that Alex had turned into a handsome man. Maybe even hotter than adult Noah. His actual innocent confusion in contrast with his hairy and virile body made him look adorable to her eyes. She can&#39;t believe she was getting attracted by Alex, the same kid she likes to bully at school because of how small and pathetic he looks.<br />
<br />
Alex felt very exposed and ashamed but at the same time he liked Sam&#39;s words. He was also feeling something different for her, and those feelings were getting stronger in his crotch where he was getting his first grownup erection. Max and Ricky noticed it, and before things get more awkward they suggested to leave the beach and return to Alex&#39;s home. Sam and Alex agreed and Ricky drove them back.<br />
<br />
Sam took the seat next to Ricky while Alex and Max were sitting in the back. Max was taking care of Noah, because Alex was still moving very weirdly because of his bigger frame. During the trip, he can&#39;t stop touching and feeling his new muscles, the copious amount of body hair on his chest, belly, legs and arms. He even blushed a little when he touched his armpit hair and he blushed even more when he touched the ones in his crotch.<br />
<br />
For some reason he didn&#39;t know, he desperately wanted to touch his penis, to feel it, to rub it, to stroke it. Before he put his hand on it, he quickly glanced at his friends. Ricky was completely focused on his driving, and Max was looking at baby Noah. Then, Alex looked at Sam and he noticed she was looking through her window. It was his time to do it. He put a hand inside his tight briefs and grabbed his dick.<br />
<br />
He expected he had grown one or two inches more, so when he realized that he was holding a true 8 inches monster in his hand he got totally red and surprised. He was holding a veiny, hairy and long man&#39;s cock. And it was his cock. He wasn&#39;t an underdeveloped kid anymore, he was as hung as a pornstar and he can&#39;t avoid feeling proud of it. His former shame and low self-esteem were a thing of the past. He now felt proud and powerful, capable of anything.<br />
<br />
Sam can&#39;t take Alex from her mind since the moment she saw him turning into a grown man. She didn&#39;t want it, but she can&#39;t keep denying she now felt attracted to the hirsute man that the shrimp had turned into. She didn&#39;t want to look at him at first, so she was toying with the Chronivac and found a way to repair all the buildings that Noah had destroyed. It also made everyone forget about the mayhem that it caused.<br />
<br />
When she was done with that, Sam look for a way to look at Alex without him noticing it. She managed to place a pocket mirror in front of her that gave her a perfect view of Alex and what he was doing. She felt aroused just by watching him touching himself, but when she noticed that he had started to play with his dick, she almost took hee mirror in shame. However, she didn&#39;t and she was glad of her choice, because Alex&#39;s initial curiosity was quickly turning into a masturbating session.<br />
<br />
Alex was hardly trying to be as quiet as possible. He desperately wanted to moan and groan in pleasure but he was keeping it inside him. His breathing was turning erratic and his movement was making some noises on the seat. If he wasn&#39;t as focused on his dick, he would have noticed that Sam, Ricky and Max were now staring at him. Max and Ricky with s concerned look on their faces but Sam with a delightful grin on her. This is what she was expecting to see from the moment she got the Chronivac and it seems that Alex is going to be the one who is going to give it to her.</p>
