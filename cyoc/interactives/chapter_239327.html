<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Henry walks towards the alligator enclosure, deep in thought and excited that he actually is really able to communicate with reptiles, he doesn’t notice the zoo keeper walking up behind him, the boy jumps and lets out a surprised yelp when he feels someone tap his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Henry spins around, staring up at the smiling face of the 45-year-old man wearing the zoo’s uniform, “sorry, kid,” he says, “I didn’t mean to startle you, my name is Rick, I run this zoo. I couldn’t help but notice you talking to that king cobra and I was surprised as it seemed to be intensely listening to you, as if it understood what you said”.<br />
<br />
Henry hesitates, he could clearly see the curiousity in the man’s eyes, would it really be so bad if he’d told him? The man might not even believe him anyway, the 12-year-old shrugs, “oh, I’m able to communicate with snakes,” he says, then explains everything to the man.<br />
<br />
“Wow, that sure is something,” he says, “though it’s hard to believe, but I can tell that you are serious. You wouldn’t mind if we’d go somewhere private to talk more about this app of yours? I’m really curious and would also like to see some demonstration or proof that it really works”.<br />
<br />
Henry shuffles his feet, looking rather nervous, “I… I dunno,” he says, “I mean… I… I don’t know you. I shouldn’t go with strangers”.<br />
<br />
“I get that,” Rick says, smiling, “I promise I’m not planning to do anything to harm you, I’d just like to learn more about the app and see a small demonstration, I’d prefer to do it in private, I mean… if the wrong person should witness something… you might end up being in danger”.<br />
<br />
Henry thinks for a while, “okay, I’ll go with you,” he says, “you do make a good point, I’d prefer keeping the app a secret”.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles wide, “then follow me to my office,” he says, “we’ll have our peace and quiet there”.<br />
<br />
Henry nods, “okay, lead the way, Rick, my name is Henry by the way”.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles, “it’s a pleasure to meet you, Henry,” he says, “follow me,” he then starts walking towards the exit, Henry right by his side.<br />
<br />
Henry follows Rick through the zoo until they enter a large building on the other side of the large zoo.<br />
<br />
Rick leads Henry through a hallway until they stop in front of a wooden door, the man opens the door and smiles down at Henry, “please, come in and take a seat,” he says.<br />
<br />
The office is modest, a small desk, two arm chairs in front of it and some file cabinets, Henry takes a seat on one of the armchairs, while Rick takes a seat behind his desk.<br />
<br />
Rick leans forward, “so, tell me: what exactly is the app able to do?”<br />
<br />
Henry begins explaining everything to the man, who listens intensely, “damn, that is one hell of a program, in the wrong hands it could be extremely dangerous,” he says.<br />
<br />
Henry nods, “yeah, who knows what chaos and damage a criminal could do with it,” he says.<br />
<br />
Rick nods, “would you mind showing me something,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Henry tilts his head, “like what?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I really like wolves,” Rick says, “I think they are the most majestic and powerful creatures, plus they are such beautiful beasts”.<br />
<br />
“I agree, wolves are pretty cool,” Henry says, “but what exactly would you like me to do?”<br />
<br />
Rick grins, “I’d like you to use that app of yours to transform me into an anthropomorphic dire wold with black fur,” he says.<br />
<br />
Henry hesitates, “I… I dunno… I mean, I am already intimidated by you,” he says, “if you’d be a anthro dire wolf, I’d be even more nervous”.<br />
<br />
Rick grins, “that’s exactly why I want you to do it,” he says, “I want everybody on this planet respect me”.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what’s in it for me,” Henry asks.<br />
<br />
Rick grins, “if you do this for me, I promise to protect you from any harm and danger,” he says, “plus, you’d get a life long free pass to visit my zoo”.<br />
<br />
Henry’s eyes widen, “really?! A life long free pass to this zoo? That… that would be amazing!”<br />
<br />
Rick grins, “well, all you need to do is do as I say and transform me into an anthro dire wolf!”<br />
<br />
Henry thinks for a while, “a life long free pass to the zoo,” he mutters to himself, “I could visit Phantom ever day! Okay, I’ll do it”.<br />
<br />
“Sweet, so what do I have to do,” Rick asks.<br />
<br />
“Nothing, just stay still,” Henry says, taking out his phone and aiming the camera at the man.<br />
<br />
Rick then watches Henry type into the phone, after a few minutes, Rick feels a tingling rush through his body, which causes him to shiver. He then grimaces when his clothes suddenly feel uncomfortable and without thinking he begins to strip.<br />
<br />
Henry just sits there, watching the man strip out of his clothes, seeming to not to be bothered by the 45-year-old getting naked, after all: he’d seen Jeff naked too, and this is nothing different than that.<br />
<br />
Rick’s eyes widen when he watches black fur begin spreading over his body, his cock erects, the skin melting to his tummy as it takes on the shape of a sheath. The man moans when he feels the head of his cock change, and his eyes widen even more when he sees a large canine shaoed cocked, including a knot at the base, emerge from his sheath. “This… this is incredible,” Rick breaths, turning his head and grinning wide when he sees his tail grow from his back, the tail immediately beginning to wag. Rick’s ears become larger and pointy, as they migrate to the top of his head, his short brown hair taking on the length, color and texture of his black fur. The man lets out a groan as his face pushes out into a muzzle, his teeth becoming long and sharp, as his nails become sharp claws. Rick’s heels lengthen, causing the transforming man to stand on his toes, which take on the shape of paws, paw pads appearing on the underside of his paws and palms of his hands. The man’s thighs and hips pop and crack as the bones rearrange themselves, giving him digitigrade legs, finally the man’s green eyes become yellow, his sense of smell and his hearing increase and with that the transformation concludes.<br />
<br />
Henry stares with wide eyes at the large beast in front of him, which looks like a were-wolf from some horror movie, ‘what have I done,’ the boy asks himself, fear growing inside of him.<br />
<br />
Rick looks himself over, grinning down at his “improved” cock, “hehe… the females will defiantly enjoy my new cock,” he says, licking his lips, then his eyes land on Henry. The wolf-man notices the fear in the boy’s eyes, “relax, Henry,” Rick chuckles, sitting down again, “no need to be afraid. Tell me, is this permanent?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yes, sir… I mean Rick,” Henry says, “everyone on this planet, except you and me, think you have always been an anthro wolf”.<br />
<br />
Rick grins, “sweet, so no one will be bothered of me running around nude,” he asks, “I mean… I’d really prefer not to have to wear stupid clothes!”<br />
<br />
Henry nods, “y-yeah… no one will mind,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Nice,” Rick says, “well, I guess you’ve done your side of the deal,” he then turns to his computer, typing something in it, he then prints out the document, and after signing and stamping the document, hands it over to Henry, “here you go!”<br />
<br />
Henry takes the document, his eyes widen, “I, Rick Gonzalez, owner of Baltimore Zoo, hereby give Henry Davis permission to enjoy a life long free pass to all exhibits of the zoo. Signed and stamped Rick Gonzalez!”<br />
<br />
Rick grins at the boy, who just gapes at him, “you see, I keep what I promise,” he says, “we are even. Now, get out, I’ve got work to do, besides: it’s getting late and I believe you still have to buy some juicy mice or rats for your snake-brother?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah,” Henry says, getting to his feet, “th-thanks, Rick,” he then says.<br />
<br />
“No problem, Henry,” the wolf-man says, “I’ll see you around”.<br />
<br />
Henry simply nods and exits the office, closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
Rick leans back in his chair, grinning wide, looking at himself in a small mirror on the opposite wall, “amazing, I am really what I always wanted to be,” he says to himself, his grin widens, taking out his phone, “let’s see if we can’t find that app,” he says before opening the app-store and soon Rick now owns his own Chronivac-app. The wolf-man grins, “good thing I have a waist bag, I can store my phone in it and clip it around my waist,” his grin widens, “I’ll have some fun with the app,” he says, before getting to his feet… paws and heading out of his office and building.</p>
