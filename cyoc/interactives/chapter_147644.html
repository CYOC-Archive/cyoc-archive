<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jimmy could only stare in amazement as the beautiful brown mare in front of him started grazing. It had turned him on watching his friend transform into a horse, no sense denying it, but now that the initial shock had worn off the arousal was slowly being replaced with confusion and fear. <br />
<br />
&quot;P-Petula?&quot; he stammered. The mare raised its head briefly before going back to eating. If Petula was still in there, her mind seemed to be largely subdued by the horse&#39;s natural instincts. &quot;What the fuck... how...&quot; Jimmy racked his brain before coming to the inescapable conclusion. He had caused this. Earlier on today he had randomly thought that Petula would make a fine horse, and sure enough, she had turned into a horse right before his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I made this happen, what else can I do?&quot; he said out loud, keeping a close but safe distance between himself and Petula. The first thing to do would be to turn Petula back. Watching her transform was hot, but he wasn&#39;t going to leave one of his few friends stuck as an animal forever. If he could undo it, then he felt he could go and experiment at will knowing that he had full control over it.<br />
<br />
But Jimmy also didn&#39;t want to stick around too long. It would take a lot of explaining to make Petula understand what had happened, and he didn&#39;t want her to be furious with him. Certainly not while she weighed half a ton. He made a solemn promise to explain and let her in on the secret, but at the same time decided it was best for his health to let her transform back and recover without him around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s see...&quot; He bit his lip nervously. &quot;Umm... Petula, I want you to become human again?&quot; He had barely thought this out before the mare in front of him stiffened, as though it had been stung by a bee, its body starting to ripple and change. The fur on its body started thinning out, revealing Petula&#39;s smooth, tanned, and human skin.<br />
<br />
Satisfied, Jimmy ran for it, leaving the transforming mare to recover. In a few minutes, Petula found herself naked - and thankfully alone - in the old athletic field, the fragments of her clothes scattered around her. &quot;What the- what happened?&quot; she shouted, scrabbling awkwardly back to her feet. Of Jimmy there was no sign, but as she collected enough rags to preserve some modesty, she swore she&#39;d get answers.<br />
<br />
- - -<br />
<br />
Jimmy, meanwhile, had found his way back to the new athletic field and started scanning for someone to... &quot;experiment&quot; on. There weren&#39;t many outside right now, but there was enough to have the choice of targets.<br />
<br />
Anna Strickland and Ella Palmer were seated on the bleachers and texting on their phones while talking and giggling to each other. They were both tall and well-built, dressed in the finest preppy apparel their parents could buy (and their parents could certainly buy a lot). Anna&#39;s was blond and blue-eyed while Ella&#39;s carefully braided black hair framed her chocolate-brown skin, but despite looking like complete opposites, they were interchangeable as far as Jimmy was concerned.<br />
<br />
Eileen Kaye sat some distance from them, working on her homework and glancing annoyed over her glasses at her classmates. She had short red hair and a round pale face sprinkled with freckles. Short and rather curvy, she was a nerdy type - she and Jimmy might have gotten along, if only she had any interest besides her grades.<br />
<br />
Jaclyn Bianchi and Kaitlyn Russo were standing on the field and talking. Always gossiping, those two. Athletes, cheerleaders, and dancers, their toned, lithe bodies were well-highlighted in their crop tops and short skirts. Jaclyn had two long pigtails while Kaitlyn had an upright ponytail forming a fountain over her head. Kaitlyn was also taller than her friend but also skinnier. Both had black hair, brown eyes, olive skin, and a spiteful attitude towards anyone else they viewed as inferior.<br />
<br />
Miss Magdalena Bennett was on the far end of the field, trying desperately to finish her grading for the day. Jimmy felt bad for her. She was... well... very top-heavy. It was impossible not to notice, and even more inconvenient with her extremely shy nature. It was her first year teaching there, and her curvy appearance had resulted in some very nasty letters from parents as well as harrassment from coworkers and even students. With no other school nearby willing to hire her, she had taken to wearing the baggiest, least flattering clothes she could find, and had a permanent resting scared face. Like a whipped dog, or a deer caught in headlights. She even hid her beautiful golden-brown curly hair in a tight cap, and wore the most goofy glasses she could find. Jimmy knew she was always one step away from being fired, and as such was terrified of speaking up for herself.<br />
<br />
Mrs Kim Gibson on the other hand was a middle-aged veteran of the classroom. Graying hair in a tight bun, businesslike clothing, and a steely gaze all projected an air of dominance that made her the terror of students and teachers alike. She was standing by herself, looking at her phone and smoking a cigarette. Not that smoking was allowed on the grounds, but nobody would ever dare gainsay Mrs Gibson. It was said in hushed whispers that she was the actual power behind the principal, and could take his place if she wanted to.<br />
<br />
Jimmy whistled, impressed. So many choices! He wasn&#39;t even sure what animals he wanted to try, or even if it was possible to do something else. Who to start with?</p>
