<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Author&#39;s note: Didn&#39;t get to posting this before now because it took me some time to come up with names for the other 6 Talbot groups, since Peter&#39;s father Leon is the oldest of 7 sons. Unique names are courtesy of 20,000 names.com Hope you like the following.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
As Peter Talbot parked at the curb in front of his house, Karen Yuletide couldn&#39;t help noticing all the other cars in the area. While she didn&#39;t know all the makes and models, Karen could tell they were all classics like his.<br />
&quot;Your family certainly has been busy,&quot; she observed.<br />
&quot;Yes. It was my father&#39;s idea to help keep peace in the family. Other than parts, everyone helped with restoring each other&#39;s vehicles. That way, each son, wife, or daughter picked out their own to avoid sibling rivalry amongst the brothers and their families,&quot; said Peter, as he held the door open for his girlfriend.<br />
They had stopped and grabbed a quick bite to go at the local diner, careful not to spill anything within or on the interior of Peter&#39;s car. As she grabbed her day bag from the back seat, the text tone on Karen&#39;s cellphone chimed.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s from Jenny!&quot; she announced, looking at her phone. She read the message to Peter.<br />
I&#39;M SAFE. HARPERS & I RELOCATED TO NEW LOCATION 4 WEEKEND. SKULK HAVE PLAN TO CATCH IMPOSTOR BUT KEEP ALERT!–JENNY.<br />
&quot;That is good to hear,&quot; replied Peter, while securing his car for the day.<br />
&quot;Yes, but to move the entire Harper family? I thought this guy was just after Jenny for that jerk back in Alabama,&quot; commented Karen.<br />
&quot;Maybe. Maybe not. This suspect could always try to use one of the other Harpers as leverage against Jenny for her cooperation,&quot; pointed out Peter. <i>Or part of his mission could be to kill Harry before dragging Jenny unwillingly back home. I will have to talk to father about this when we have a moment alone.</i><br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; was all Karen said, while securing her cellphone.<br />
&quot;Ready to meet the rest of my extended family?&quot; he asked, taking her hand in his.<br />
&quot;As ready as I&#39;ll ever be,&quot; replied Karen with a smile, as they started to walk up the long driveway to the garage.<br />
<br />
Karen noted that the garage where the Talbots did their car restorations was 3 bays long, although only one actually had a project in it at the moment.<br />
However, all 3 doors were open, with a WHOLE lot of people lined up across them.<br />
&quot;Greetings Karen,&quot; said Peter&#39;s father Leon, with his wife Regina right behind him. &quot;I hope today finds you well.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me personally, yes; although there have been new developments with my friend Jennifer Harper that don&#39;t bode well for her,&quot; replied Karen.<br />
&quot;I am sad to hear that. Perhaps when we have a moment, you can tell me and then I&#39;ll talk to my brothers. Speaking of which, it is time to meet the entire Talbot clan,&quot; said Leon, walking to the far left hand of the open garage doors. Karen and Peter followed him as Leon said, &quot;Starting with the next oldest after myself, may I present my brother Tau, which is African for Lion, his wife Nubia, and their daughter Joy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Greetings young one,&quot; said Tau, smiling at Karen, as she shook each person&#39;s hand as she met them.<br />
&quot;She is beautiful. You have done well,&quot; Nubia said to Peter, which made Karen blush.<br />
&quot;If we weren&#39;t related,&quot; was all Joy, who happened to be a high school senior, said.<br />
&quot;I know, but we are,&quot; was Peter&#39;s only reply.<br />
&quot;Next is Jay, his wife Olivia, and their daughter Ife, which means Love,&quot; said Leon, continuing the introductions as they moved down the line a bit.<br />
&quot;Hello. Are you really an artist?&quot; asked Jay.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Karen. &quot;I&#39;ll be happy to show everyone some of my drawings later,&quot; she added, indicating the sketch book in her shoulder bag.<br />
&quot;Although she is just a high school freshman, our daughter hopes to be an artist someday too,&quot; said Olivia, as Ife blushed.<br />
&quot;If you have any of your work with you, maybe I can take a look at it later,&quot; said Karen, trying to defuse the situation, which made Ife smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my brother Rudy, his wife Rose, and their daughter Cecelia,&quot; said Leon, continuing the introductions.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m in the Eighth grade,&quot; Cecelia said proudly.<br />
&quot;Now I am proud to introduce you to my twin brothers Apio and Adongo. Although they look alike, Apio was born 5 minutes ahead of Adongo,&quot; explained Leon.<br />
&quot;Greetings,&quot; said Apio. &quot;This is my wife Lily, and our daughter Emily.&quot;<br />
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t find all of this too overwhelming,&quot; said Lily, while shaking Karen&#39;s hand.<br />
&quot;It is a lot to take in,&quot; replied Peter&#39;s girlfriend.<br />
&quot;While Ife was the last of us to experience our first transformation at the moment, for what it&#39;s worth, I think you&#39;ll make a beautiful lioness,&quot; commented Emily, to which both Karen and Peter blushed.<br />
&quot;I am Adongo Talbot,&quot; began Apio&#39;s twin brother. &quot;This is my wife Astra, and our daughter Maggie,&quot; he said, introducing his immediate family.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you. Later on, us ladies will be preparing lunch for the men. Perhaps we&#39;ll get a chance to talk more then,&quot; said Astra, hopefully.<br />
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind hanging out with a sixth grader,&quot; replied Maggie.<br />
&quot;No. Not if you don&#39;t mind hanging out with a college freshman,&quot; said Karen in return.<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; said Maggie, as Leon led Karen to the last group.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last, but certainly not least, may I present my youngest brother Noah, his wife Dahlia, and their daughter Heather,&quot; said Leon.<br />
&quot;Sorry it took so long to get to say hello to you. Big family,&quot; Noah pointed out to her.<br />
&quot;It certainly is. One you should all be proud of,&quot; added Karen, to which Noah smiled.<br />
&quot;Your hair looks so beautiful. Being a hairdresser, I can tell its the natural color, but who&#39;s your stylist?&quot; asked Dahlia.<br />
&quot;I had it trimmed at the campus beautician school a couple of weeks ago, but it&#39;s never truly had a style,&quot; replied Karen.<br />
&quot;Really? I find that hard to believe,&quot; said Dahlia in return.<br />
&quot;Mother, you just met Cousin Peter&#39;s girlfriend. She has no reason to lie to any of us,&quot; said Heather, while adjusting her glasses.<br />
&quot;I never said that young lady. I just meant that—&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; replied Karen. &quot;You&#39;re certainly a smart one, aren&#39;t you?&quot; she asked Heather.<br />
&quot;I got to skip third grade and go directly into the fourth at the beginning of this school year,&quot; Heather said proudly.<br />
&quot;Well, I hope you&#39;re getting to enjoy life along with all that academia,&quot; replied Karen.<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Heather in return.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll explain later,&quot; promised Karen, as she turned her attention back to all the Talbots. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to meet you all,&quot; she added, taking a brief bow before the entire procession. <i>With his father the oldest and Peter the only son in the entire clan, I can see why they are the Lion &quot;King and Prince&quot;.</i><br />
All the other Talbots smiled at her before Leon said, &quot;Okay gentlemen. Let&#39;s get to work. We should be able to come close to, if not actually finish our current project today. Then we can discuss our next assignment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen stayed next to Peter as all the other ladies started heading back inside the house.<br />
&quot;I still think it should be the Woody*,&quot; said Apio.<br />
&quot;But we have never worked on one of those before,&quot; said Adongo.<br />
&quot;But because we have never worked on one before is why it would be an interesting challenge,&quot; pointed out Apio.<br />
&quot;What about that air museum wanting us to restore that YB-9 bomber?&quot; asked Rudy. &quot;We don&#39;t have to get it sky worthy, just presentable for display purposes.&quot;<br />
&quot;And drive back and forth from here to Oregon to work on it? That may not be logistically practical,&quot; replied Noah.<br />
&quot;Perhaps Leon is right. Let us finish what we are working on before we discuss the future,&quot; suggested Tau.<br />
With that, the brothers Talbot set about their tasks.<br />
Leon briefly turned to look at Peter and Karen. He shrugged his shoulders and smiled before entering the garage to join his brothers.<br />
