<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The weekend passed largely without incident, apart from David getting even vainer, spending more time in front <br />
of the mirror. He got more texts from his friends asking how he was – at least three from Alex – but he told <br />
them he was still sick. David was still excited to see more of his changes and experience his new body more. <br />
He remembered the postscript of the website – fight the ocean and you will drown – so he decided not to worry <br />
about his changes and just accept them.<br />
<br />
He did resolve to go to work on Monday morning though, so before going to bed on Sunday David made sure to set <br />
his alarm for a bit earlier – he’d bunked off one day of work which was fine, but he couldn’t afford two days <br />
in a row. And dressed in his baggier uniform on Monday, sure enough David set off for work.<br />
<br />
When he got there, he ran straight into Mrs Somers, the person he least wanted to see.<br />
<br />
“David! Feeling better I see?” she cooed with a very fake smile.<br />
<br />
“Yes Mrs Somers, ready for work again!”<br />
<br />
“Good....oh, did you get that doctor’s note I asked for?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, no, sorry Mrs Somers.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm,” she said as she walked away, making a note of something on her pad.<br />
<br />
David shrugged and got to work. Normally he would have been quick and efficient, taking orders rapidly, <br />
passing them on to the kitchen, never making mistakes and always double-checking. But today there was <br />
something off about David, his colleagues noticed. He was slow, mixed up tables’ orders, added up bills wrong, <br />
often undercharging by twenty or thirty dollars. He’d also spend time admiring himself in the silverware. Mrs <br />
Somers noticed too, and every time David made a mistake, she’d make another little note in her pad.<br />
<br />
When it came to the end of his day on Monday, David went straight home. But instead of admiring himself in the <br />
mirror as he had done all weekend, David was feeling restless. He felt full of energy, so he went out for a <br />
walk. But he quickly got frustrated at how slow he was going, so he started running. But David got to the <br />
middle of town before he even felt warmed up. In the middle of town though, he saw a 24-hour gym. It was one <br />
of the best things he’d seen in a long time, he needed to go inside. So he opened the door, and before he’d <br />
even realised it was registered as a member and pumping iron, his new muscles glistening with sweat. After <br />
almost three hours of solid working out, his body shining and damp, he spent a moment flexing in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Aw fuck yeah,” David said as he saw himself pull these poses. He looked so good, his new body suited him so <br />
well. Why didn’t every guy try and look like this, he wondered. Why hadn’t he tried to look like this before? <br />
It seemed mad now he thought about it that he spent time drinking with his friends when he could have been <br />
working out.<br />
<br />
David started a routine very easily – put in the bare minimum at work and then rush on over to the gym to work <br />
out for three hours, sometimes more, every day. He was making more mistakes at work, taking less care with his <br />
orders and spending more time admiring himself in mirrors and spoons and anything else remotely reflective for <br />
that matter. He just couldn’t make himself care about the job any more. He needed to workout, needed to see <br />
more gains like he’d had in his first week. He’d thought he was happy at that size but no: he needed to grow <br />
now, needed to get huge!<br />
<br />
He decided to measure himself at the end of every Friday, and sure enough by the end of the second week he had <br />
grown more. He weighed 220lbs, his biceps were now edging on 19 inches, his pecs were big and round, a proper <br />
6 pack had developed (he’d beaten off like a maniac over his new body the day he discovered that). He also <br />
noticed now that his face had changed. It was....well, it was hard to describe exactly what had changed. He <br />
just knew he looked better – what the girls probably would have called pretty. That thought shocked David – <br />
not because he was a pretty boy now, but more because this was the first time he had thought about girls in <br />
nearly a week. He’d jerked off plenty in that time, but always over his own body and how hot he looked, and <br />
never over girls like he used to. But, as David seemed to do more and more these days, he just shrugged it off <br />
and looked his body over again. He then got the ruler and string to check his dick. He was sure it hadn’t <br />
grown but wanted to make sure. David put the ruler at the base of his dick, shifting his pubes to do so, and <br />
got a shock.<br />
<br />
Eleven inches!<br />
<br />
“Eleven inches?! Fucking eleven! What the fuck will I do with this pole now?!” David shouted, until he <br />
remembered he could still jerk off, which he promptly did. While he was jerking and flexing in the mirror his <br />
phone buzzed so, with some difficulty, he left the mirror and checked it. There was a text:<br />
<br />
‘first 2 weeks are up, we should meet up to see how its gone and whats next. The orange bar, 10 tonight. Tony’<br />
<br />
David was suddenly a little worried. He hadn’t really thought of that giant Tony since the night this all <br />
began, and now he was a bit concerned for two reasons. First, he’d only wanted to grow a bit, not to Tony’s <br />
monster size. But Tony had said that when he started the change he’d been David’s size. David felt a need to <br />
grow but at the back of his mind he knew his size was already conspicuous so he didn’t want to grow much more <br />
if he could help it. And the second reason: since he remembered what Tony looked like on getting the text, <br />
David had a raging boner. He tried to shake the picture of Tony from his mind with a big-breasted hot girl, <br />
pretending he didn’t notice that his dick got a little softer. He checked the time: 2030. OK, he had time to <br />
jerk off, then find some clothes before heading to the Orange Bar to meet Tony.<br />
<br />
David went back into the bathroom and smiled at his reflection – fuck he looked good. He took his hard dick in <br />
one hard and started stroking while he massaged his big pecs with his other hand. Oh fuck that felt good, he <br />
thought. On a whim he spat on his dick as makeshift lube (immediately wondering why he’d done it), and jerked <br />
more vigorously, his hand quickly moving up and down his huge shaft. It was thicker than before too, but he <br />
could find out how thick later, because just then he shot hot cum all over his torso, right up to his neck.<br />
<br />
“Ohhh fuck!” David cried as he cleaned himself up. He checked the time: 2110. Just next to the alarm clock he <br />
caught sight of his book of crosswords.<br />
<br />
‘I have a few minutes, I’ll give one a go,’ thought David. He opened the book at random and found a puzzle he <br />
hadn’t done yet. He looked at the first clue:<br />
<br />
‘Gathering of crows (6)’<br />
<br />
David tapped his pen against his leg as he thought about it. Did it begin with an M? David’s brow furrowed. As <br />
he thought about it he started to get a headache so he shrugged and moved onto another clue – one of the other <br />
questions would help him get this one, just needed his memory jogging.<br />
<br />
‘_____ W Bush, US president (6)’<br />
<br />
‘Fuck,’ thought David, ‘What was his name?’ He remembered hating him with a passion, but for the life of him <br />
he’d no idea what his name was. Just like before, the more he thought about it, the more his head hurt. Why <br />
was this so hard anyway? He must have picked one of the hard crosswords by mistake. But David looked at the <br />
top of the page and saw it was a one star out of three difficulty.<br />
<br />
As David was putting the book down, bored of the challenge of puzzles, he wondered if this was connected to <br />
his work problems? This wasn’t a difficult puzzle, and his job wasn’t hard but he kept messing them up anyway. <br />
Could he be losing his intelligence? By this time David saw it was 2140 – fuck, I spent half an hour on those <br />
two clues?! David thought – so he picked some clothes from his very limited wardrobe and headed out to the <br />
Orange Bar.</p>
