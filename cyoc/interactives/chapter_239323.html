<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">**Chapter Two: Role Reversal**  <br />
<br />
Alex stared at the second ring in the box, his heart pounding with curiosity and a mischievous thrill. If the first ring had turned his dad into a clueless nine-year-old, what would happen if he put on the second one?  <br />
<br />
Without hesitating, Alex slipped the green-banded ring onto his finger.  <br />
<br />
The change hit him instantly. A rush of heat spread through his body as he began to grow. His limbs lengthened, his shoulders broadened, and his once-slim frame filled out with layers of thick, powerful muscle. His chest expanded, his shirt tearing at the seams as his abs became a sculpted wall of strength.  <br />
<br />
He glanced down at himself, his hands now large and calloused, veins popping along his forearms. Even his voice sounded different as he let out a stunned laugh.  <br />
<br />
“Holy crap…” Alex muttered, his new baritone booming in the room. He flexed experimentally, marveling at his strength.  <br />
<br />
Behind him, his newly nine-year-old dad, Rick, tugged at the oversized hoodie and jeans that swallowed his small frame.  <br />
<br />
“Dad?” Rick called, his voice high-pitched and confused. He blinked up at Alex with wide, innocent eyes. “What are you doing? You look funny!”  <br />
<br />
Alex turned to face him, towering over the now tiny Rick. It was surreal to see his once-imposing father reduced to a little kid with baggy clothes hanging off his frame.  <br />
<br />
Alex grinned. “Funny? You’re the one playing dress-up in my clothes, *son.*”  <br />
<br />
Rick’s brow furrowed, his small hands tugging at the waistband of the jeans that bunched around his waist. “These aren’t yours! They’re… wait…” He paused, tilting his head as confusion flickered across his face. “You’re my dad! Right?”  <br />
<br />
Alex raised an eyebrow, leaning down slightly. “That’s right. And I need *my* clothes back. You shouldn’t be messing with them.”  <br />
<br />
Rick pouted, crossing his skinny arms. “But I’m not! They’re mine now! ”  saying it like a boy being curt playing a silly game and not wanting to admit to it.<br />
<br />
Alex stepped closer, his new, larger presence making Rick step back instinctively. “You’re nine years old. You don’t even *fit* in these.”  <br />
<br />
Before Rick could argue, Alex knelt down and started tugging the oversized hoodie off Rick’s small frame.  <br />
<br />
“Hey! What are you doing?” Rick squealed, squirming like any kid being forced out of their clothes.  <br />
<br />
“I’m taking *my* clothes back,” Alex said firmly, his deep voice making it clear who was in charge.  <br />
<br />
“Stop! Daaaad!” Rick whined, now fully convinced Alex was—and always had been—his father.  <br />
<br />
Rick flailed as Alex pulled the hoodie over his head, leaving him in an oversized T-shirt that nearly reached his knees. Alex shook his head, amused by how completely Rick had embraced his new reality.  <br />
<br />
“These don’t even fit you,” Alex said, shaking out the hoodie and slipping it on. It was tight, stretching across his now-muscular frame, but it would do for now.  <br />
<br />
Rick huffed, crossing his arms and glaring. “fine I was just playing dress-up,” he muttered, his cheeks flushing pink.  <br />
<br />
Alex laughed, slipping into the jeans. They were a little snug around his thighs, but they fit well enough. He stood tall, adjusting the waistband and looking down at Rick with a smug grin. “Looks like I’m even bigger than you used to be.”  <br />
<br />
The doorbell rang, breaking the moment.  <br />
<br />
Alex glanced at Rick, who had plopped onto the couch in a pout. “Go put on something that *actually* fits, buddy.”  <br />
<br />
Rick frowned but nodded, heading upstairs. “Fine, Dad,” he muttered, as if it were the most natural thing in the world to call Alex that.  <br />
<br />
Alex turned to answer the door, his large frame filling the doorway as he opened it. Standing outside was a woman in her mid-thirties with a friendly smile and a shy boy standing behind her.  <br />
<br />
“Hi there! I’m Melissa,” the woman said, extending a hand. “We just moved in down the street. Thanks for letting Jimmy hang out today.”  <br />
<br />
Alex shook her hand, trying to act natural despite his internal panic. “No problem. I’m Alex—I mean, Rick,” he corrected, realizing he needed to play the part.  <br />
<br />
Melissa’s eyes lingered on him for a moment, her smile widening slightly. “Well, it’s nice to meet you, Rick.”  <br />
<br />
Jimmy shuffled nervously, glancing up at Alex. “Hi,” he mumbled.  <br />
<br />
“Hey there, Jimmy,” Alex said, his voice deep and reassuring. “Come on in. The boys are upstairs.”  <br />
<br />
As Melissa waved goodbye, Alex closed the door and turned to Jimmy, who was still eyeing him warily.  <br />
<br />
“You’re… kinda big,” Jimmy said.  <br />
<br />
Alex laughed. “Yeah, I get that a lot. Rick—uh, my son—will show you around.”  <br />
<br />
Just then, Rick came bounding down the stairs, now dressed in one of Alex’s old hoodies and jeans that were far too big for him. “Jimmy! Let’s go play upstairs!”  <br />
<br />
Jimmy brightened immediately. “Okay!”  <br />
<br />
Alex watched the two boys race upstairs, shaking his head in disbelief.  <br />
<br />
“Man of the house, huh?” he muttered to himself. With a grin, he flexed his arms, marveling at the power in his new body. “I think I could get used to this.”  <br />
<br />
Upstairs, the sound of Rick and Jimmy laughing echoed through the house.  <br />
<br />
“Come on, Jimmy!” Rick’s voice rang out. “Let’s build something awesome!”  <br />
<br />
Alex leaned back against the couch, his grin widening. This was going to be an interesting day.  <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
**Chapter Three: Stepping Into the Role**  <br />
<br />
Four hours into his new life as an adult, Alex was starting to feel like he was getting the hang of things. Sure, he was still 13 on the inside, but his new 40-year-old body came with a strange sense of confidence and instinct. He knew how to handle things around the house, from cooking dinner to fixing a leaky faucet. It was like muscle memory—he didn’t overthink it; he just *did it.*  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Rick, now fully embracing his role as the nine-year-old son, was blissfully clueless about his former life. He and Jimmy had spent the afternoon upstairs, watching cartoons, building pillow forts, and laughing so hard Alex could hear it from the living room. Rick didn’t even flinch when Alex called him “son,” responding like it was the most natural thing in the world.  <br />
<br />
For Alex, it was surreal. His dad—now his *kid*—was running around like a ball of chaos, and Alex was the calm, composed adult keeping the household together.  <br />
<br />
When the doorbell rang, Alex knew it was Melissa coming to pick up Jimmy. He opened the door to see her smiling warmly, a light breeze catching her auburn hair.  <br />
<br />
“Hey, Rick,” she said, using the name Alex had introduced himself with earlier. Her eyes lingered on him, taking in his tall, muscular frame.  <br />
<br />
“Hey, Melissa,” Alex said, stepping aside to let her in. He felt a strange flutter in his chest as she walked past him, her perfume leaving a subtle, pleasant trail.  <br />
<br />
“Thanks again for letting Jimmy hang out. I hope he wasn’t any trouble,” Melissa said, leaning casually against the counter in the kitchen.  <br />
<br />
“Not at all,” Alex said, feeling a little nervous but trying to play it cool. “The boys had a blast. I think they’re upstairs watching cartoons or something.”  <br />
<br />
Melissa chuckled. “Sounds like Jimmy. He loves anything animated.”  <br />
<br />
Alex nodded, suddenly hyper-aware of how close they were standing. He couldn’t help but notice the way Melissa’s eyes sparkled when she looked at him, or the way she brushed a strand of hair behind her ear.  <br />
<br />
“Would you like a coffee or something before you head out?” Alex asked, surprising himself.  <br />
<br />
Melissa’s smile widened. “I’d love one. Thanks.”  <br />
<br />
As Alex brewed the coffee, the air between them grew warmer, a charged silence hanging in the kitchen. Alex felt torn. On one hand, he still had the mind of a 13-year-old. On the other, his body—and the confidence that came with it—felt completely at ease in this situation.  <br />
<br />
They chatted idly as the coffee brewed, their conversation flowing easily. Melissa laughed at his jokes, and Alex found himself smiling more than he expected. She leaned against the counter, her hand brushing his arm lightly as she reached for her coffee cup.  <br />
<br />
The simple touch sent a jolt through him.  <br />
<br />
“You’re… really great with the boys,” Melissa said softly, her voice carrying a note of admiration.  <br />
<br />
Alex swallowed hard, feeling his cheeks warm. “Thanks. I try.”  <br />
<br />
Melissa stepped closer, her gaze flicking between his eyes and his lips. Alex’s heart raced, and before he could process what was happening, she leaned in and kissed him.  <br />
<br />
For a moment, Alex froze, his brain screaming, *What are you doing?!* But his body had other ideas. His hands found her waist, pulling her closer as he kissed her back.  <br />
<br />
The kiss deepened, and Alex felt his adult instincts take over, guiding him as if he’d done this a thousand times before. He wasn’t thinking anymore—he was just *acting.*  <br />
<br />
They broke apart briefly, Melissa’s cheeks flushed as she smiled up at him.  <br />
<br />
“Should we…” she began, glancing toward the hallway.  <br />
<br />
Alex nodded, his hand slipping into hers. Without a word, he led her to what was now *his* master bedroom.  <br />
<br />
As they entered, Alex hesitated for a split second, his teenage mind briefly catching up to his adult body. But then Melissa pulled him into another kiss, and everything else faded away.  <br />
<br />
---  <br />
<br />
Upstairs, Rick and Jimmy were still glued to the TV, laughing at a ridiculous animated show.  <br />
<br />
“Your dad’s kinda cool,” Jimmy said, munching on some leftover snacks.  <br />
<br />
Rick shrugged, his legs kicking idly as he sat on the floor. “Yeah, he’s okay. But he’s kinda lame sometimes.”  <br />
<br />
Jimmy laughed. “All dads are lame.”  <br />
<br />
Rick grinned. “Come on, let’s go build that fort we talked about!”  <br />
<br />
The two boys dashed off, completely oblivious to the quiet, unfolding drama downstairs.</p>
