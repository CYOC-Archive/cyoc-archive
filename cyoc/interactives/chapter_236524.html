<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Four evenings later Adam was drying himself off after his evening shower. His muscles still complained with every movement, but it was becoming easier to block out the constant, throbbing pain he felt when moving. It took him a bit to get moving in the morning, he woke up so stiff, but at least as long as he kept moving he could still make it through the evenings.<br />
<br />
He even felt like he could see his muscles beginning to respond to the constant farm work. He could actually make out his chest muscles, not that they were large or even all that noticeable, but they at least had some shape to them. Same with his arms, and he could have sworn his shoulders looked broader.<br />
<br />
But that wasn&#39;t what had him worried, if anything, that was the good part. Bruce had blackmailed him into letting him hook him up to the milking machine on a daily basis now, not being allowed to unhook himself until he came. It was a daily embarrassment that Bruce took every pleasure in watching. And each session gave him more an more material to threaten Adam with.<br />
<br />
Looking in the bathroom mirror, his nipple looked noticeably swollen. They weren&#39;t as large and plump as Bruce&#39;s were, but they were definitely bigger than they had been, and the suction of the milking machine just seemed to be making them all the bigger. Even odder were the black hairs that were now growing around his nipples on his previously smooth chest, even a few hairs had started growing in the middle of his chest, he swore even his pubes seemed thicker and were beginning to migrate upward towards his navel. He didn&#39;t even know how constant suction could grow body hair.<br />
<br />
He had tried to look that up on his phone, but the moment Hank saw him with it, he confiscated the device, telling Adam he could have it back once he proved himself. Whatever that meant. He barely saw Hank except at meal times, Bruce was the his constant taskmaster, and the farmer&#39;s son had begun treating Adam like his personal pet. It was infuriating.<br />
<br />
He stared blearily into the mirror. Adding to his scruffy look was the fact he only had gotten up the energy to shave once since he&#39;d gotten here, and for some reason his sparse beard seemed to be extra stubbly as of late.  He ran his hand over his face, then down his chest, and without thinking over his stomach, which made him flinch.<br />
<br />
He had ben doing his best to try to ignore that expanse of torso between his crotch and chest. The four little pink mounds that stuck out almost an inch from his now flatter stomach. Each session in the milking machine made them stick out even further. He didn&#39;t think the machine had enough strength to permanently damage his skin like it seemed to be doing. Worse, they were sensitive, and touching them sent shivers up his spine. He almost wished his chest stuck out like Bruce&#39;s so the denim would rub against them like it did through the day.<br />
<br />
Worse, Bruce seemed to know exactly what Adam was going through. Sometimes after he let out a little gasp or moan when the nubs were stimulated, he&#39;s look over to see Bruce smirking at him. That smug asshole had answers, and Adam knew it. He just needed to get them out of him. Scratching the itchy stubble on his jaw Adam started hatching a plan. He would just need to get Bruce to think of him as a friend and forget the past between them. Though that was easier said than done. With a sigh Adam pulled on his tee shirt, plucking out the front to keep it from rubbing the nubs or his nipples, though it was a losing battle. He quickly tugged on his boxers and stepped out of the bathroom, instead of heading for his room, he went to the door across the hall. No time like the present to get his plan started.<br />
<br />
Gingerly, Adam knocked on the door, and Bruce&#39;s gruff voice responded with a, &quot;Come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam took the invitation and opened the door. Bruce looked up, clearly expecting Hank, as his expression flashed to surprised for a moment as he saw Adam. &quot;Well, didn&#39;t expect you, A.&quot; Bruce said from his bed. He was shirtless and in a pair of boxer-briefs. A book was propped on his bent leg and soft country music played from a radio. Bruce&#39;s room was actually homey and lived in, unlike Adam&#39;s sparse abode. Exercise equipment sat in one corner near a large full-sized mirror, a surprising amount of books filled a bookshelf, with more stacked besides it. And a fairly nice looking computer sat on a desk by the window. &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no acid or venom in Bruce&#39;s voice. There never was, which is what made his seeming revenge feel so strange. Like it wasn&#39;t even personal.<br />
<br />
Adam gulped, and finally spoke up. &quot;Something weird is happening to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruce snorted. &quot;Well, you see when a boy reaches a certain age, he starts to grow hair in..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that.&quot; Adam snapped, and instantly regretted it, taking a deep breath. This was not going well. He lifted his shirt and motioned at his stomach, where he knew the nub stuck out. He also knew Bruce knew they were there, he had hooked up the milkers to them the last few days, but never commented on them. &quot;I think the machine is doing something weird to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruce closed his book and set it aside, then swung his leg over the side of the bed so he was sitting and motioned Adam closer. Adam stepped into the room, closing the door behind him before stepping up to Bruce. Who motioned for him to lift his shirt again, to which Adam complied.<br />
<br />
Bruce reached out and took one of the short nubs between a calloused thumb and finger, giving it a little tug that made Adam gasp. &quot;Feels good, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Bruce said with a smile, and a tone that was surprisingly gentle. &quot;Bigger they get, the better it feels. Are you enjoying it?&quot; He took another nub in his other hand, alternating little tugs on them. The sensation had Adam&#39;s cock springing to attention, tenting the front of his boxers.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing to me?&quot; Adam asked, his voice quivering in not entirely feigned fear, and more than a little excitement from the attention he was getting. &quot;You&#39;ve done this to yourself.&quot; Adam accused, looking down at Bruce&#39;s stomach where little pink nubs no bigger than the ones Adam had stuck through the brown fuzz covering his abs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t answer my question.&quot; Bruce said, ignoring Adam&#39;s questions. &quot;Are you enjoying it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam bit his lip, but nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t hear you.&quot; Bruce said, grin forming on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes.&quot; Adam stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, what?&quot; Bruce said in a good imitation of Hank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; And that made Bruce break into a wide grin, with a short bark of a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you&#39;d take longer than this to break.&quot; Bruce said simply, still tugging alternatingly on two of Adam&#39;s nubs. &quot;But if you want answers, well, you&#39;re going to have to give me something I want.&quot; Adam stared at Bruce for a moment. &quot;The milking machine is nice, but nothing like a nice warm mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m..&quot; Adam gulped. &quot;I&#39;m not..&quot; Bruce leaned forward and his lips were suddenly around one of Adam&#39;s nipples, sucking for a moment before he felt a gentle and teasing nip of the teeth. It made Adam pull back suddenly. Something felt odd as he yanked himself away from Bruce, something in the nubs on his stomach as Bruce&#39;s finger were yanked off by Adam&#39;s long step back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not gay.&quot; Adam said sternly.<br />
<br />
Bruce laughed. &quot;I&#39;ve heard more than one guy say that. I think you&#39;ll be more willing to try it than you think.&quot; Bruce said with a nod to Adam&#39;s underwear, which had a large wet spot spreading along the front where his cock pushed the fabric away from this waist. &quot;Besides, you&#39;re coming along nicely.&quot; He said as he lifted one of his hands, which had some sort of white liquid dripping from his fingers, which he licked off with a nod. &quot;Mm.. that&#39;s going to be real good when you&#39;re done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam looked down to his stomach, and noticed pearly white drops on the end of the short nubs, and another on the tip of the nipple Bruce has nibbled on. &quot;Milk?&quot; He asked, dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
Bruce just smiled. &quot;I told you, no answers until you give me what I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Half curious, half horrified Adam took one of he nubs between his fingers and gave it a firm tug, causing a small stream of warm milk to shoot out and splatter on the floor. He pulled his hand away like he was burned. He looked up at Bruce, but the muscular man simply took over on his pecs in his hand and gave it a little heft. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to know?&quot; Bruce said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Adam wanted to run away, leave the farm and never look back no matter what his dad wanted from him. Instead his feet took him in the other direction, closing the distance between him and Bruce. One time wouldn&#39;t hurt, right? And then he could get his answers. If not he might be stuck like this. He wanted Bruce to trust him, and it seemed this was going to be the price.<br />
<br />
Adam sat down on the bed, scrunching his eyes shut he leaned in. First all his lips felt was coarse chest hair, but then a hand took his chin and guided him, and in the midst of the fur he finally put his lips around Bruce&#39;s plump nipple.<br />
<br />
Just once. He thought to himself. You&#39;ve done this to girls no problem, just pretend its a hot babe with huge tits. Of course the hair tickling his nose and lips made the pretending hard, but he tried locking in on the fantasy anyway.<br />
<br />
He let his tongue run over the tip and got a sound of encouragement from Bruce, then he started sucking. As he did, he felt fingers teasing one of his nipples in return, pleasure dulling the trepidation in his brain. Soon Adam found himself getting into it, and then he felt warm liquid flood his mouth. Hot, thick, and creamy. The flavor was so familiar, almost exactly like what he tasted that first day on the farm. So like the cold milk he drank with each meal. And he knew, this was not the first of Bruce&#39;s milk he had drunk.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know how long Bruce wanted him to nurse, but eventually he let go, licking his lips clean by instinct. &quot;Better right from the tap, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Part of Adam was disgusted with himself, the other part wanted another drink. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; He asked instead, finally hoping to get his answer from Bruce.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same thing that happened to me.&quot; He said with one of his toothy grins. &quot;I&#39;d hate to ruin too much of the surprise, but getting milk fresh will speed it up.&quot; Bruce added with a laugh. &quot;I think you&#39;ll come and have a drink nightly from now on. Understood? Or, you know..&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam caught Bruce&#39;s phone in the corner of his eye where it was in his hand, a fresh picture of Adam sucking on Bruce&#39;s chest on the screen. &quot;Besides, if you leave, you&#39;ll be stuck like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can undo this?&quot; Adam asked, half-hopeful. He wondered what was wrong of him that a part of him felt uncomfortable at the thought. God, would he even want this undone if he let this go on. &quot;Does Hank know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does he know? Who do you think told me to do this to you? Go to bed.&quot; Bruce instructed. &quot;You have your first real milking in the morning. Then a whole day of chores after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam didn&#39;t have a choice but to follow Bruce&#39;s orders, slinking off to bed.</p>
