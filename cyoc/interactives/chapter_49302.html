<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jensen stood quietly in the living room of Kaylee's family's home quietly thinking over things that he had masterminded. Not everything had gone as planned, as he didn't intend for Kaylee to bring Fran and Darla into the pack, but that front had turned out well. He looked up to see Kaylee seated on a couch watching in the direction in which her parents had gone, and then turned his head to see the twin she-wolves standing guard closer to the front door.<br />
<br />
Glancing at them, many of Jensen's thoughts drifted away from the tasks he had at hand. All three she-wolves were highly attractive. Their muscles all appeared perfect and helped accentuate their other features, which for Fran and Darla was probably necessary. Kaylee's breasts were somewhere in the C-cup range while Fran and Darla were easily a D-cup. All three of them had wide hips, perfect for bearing pups, and Jensen looked forward mating with Kaylee again and claiming the twins as well. Although, something in his own mind told him that when they came into heat, Kaylee would be the only one who would get pregnant. That made Jensen wonder about a few things other then what he had done so far, but he managed to shake that off, as that was something for later.<br />
<br />
Sighing quietly, Jensen returned his thoughts to what happened so far. He turned his head to look into a small den where Kaylee's parents were going through all the legal work necessary to either suddenly change professions or to simply disappear. Which if his plans went correctly was what would happen to them. They would join his own parents, eventually as wolf pup prodigies, keeping his family's mansion and estate running and insuring that the pack wouldn't be dependent on much for its future. It should leave their future open to whatever they wanted.<br />
<br />
And that was largely where Jensen hit a brick wall in terms of planning. What would the pack do, other then mate? In the stories about the Big Bad Wolf, the wolf was always alone and always seeking food. Either pigs who had built shoddy housing, or a young girl who was foolish enough to talk to the big bad wolf. And so far, Jensen felt he had played out the &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; storyline, although in his version, Red Riding Hood became Kaylee, Red Riding Wolf. Hunting would be big for them, but Jensen wasn't so sure about killing and eating people outright. It would attract too much attention... but other then some small farms on the other edge of town, there wasn't much in the way of animals to hunt. Maybe they could use the &quot;transform or dare&quot; power to transform others into some prey animal, but Jensen preferred to check the game's rules before doing that.<br />
<br />
Jensen calmly made his way into a entrance room and calmly looked out a window to the driveway where an old Ford Bronco sat next to a newer Buick car, although Jensen couldn't make out what specific model it was. It was then that he realized something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; Jensen growled as he continued to look out toward the two vehicles.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Master?&quot; came Fran's voice as the two blond she-wolves rounded a corner, &quot;is something wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That,&quot; Jensen grumbled as he pointed out toward the two vehicles.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about them?&quot; Darla asked, looking somewhat puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are too small,&quot; Jensen gave a groan, &quot;we can't all ride in one vehicle... and the other will need to be disposed of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee's parents could always take one of the two,&quot; Fran offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We still wouldn't fit,&quot; Jensen grumbled.<br />
<br />
Which was true. At nine feet tall, Jensen could feel the tops of his ears just touch the ceiling of he home they were in. Kaylee, Fran, and Darla were only seven feet tall, but that was still too tall for the vehicles that were parked on the driveway.<br />
<br />
&quot;We might have to all pack together,&quot; came Kaylee's voice as she came up behind Jensen and placing her paws on his shoulders and then added in a voice that sounded fairly seductive, &quot;it could be rather cozy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen only raised one eyebrow as the twins giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only other option would be to walk there,&quot; Kaylee told her mate.<br />
<br />
Jensen only sighed again. He glanced back toward the other rooms, where he could still hear Kaylee's folks &quot;putting their affairs in order&quot;. He didn't want to risk having them walk there, as he wasn't sure what that would do to the hold the power of the &quot;dare&quot; held on Kaylee's parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll have to take both vehicles and pack in,&quot; Jensen sighed, &quot;Darla, you will have to inform Kaylee's father that he will drive the Bronco with me and you to give him directions. Kaylee's mother will drive Kaylee and Fran in her car and will follow our group in the Bronco.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're splitting us up?&quot; Fran gasped, nervously gripping Darla's arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only for the time it takes to drive across town,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;and only to insure that Kaylee's parents do not cause trouble. We'll figure out what to do with the vehicles after we get to my family's estate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Fran and Darla gave a singular sigh as they accepted the changed plan in order to deal with the vehicles.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are your parents coming along?&quot; Jensen asked as he then turned back to Kaylee.<br />
<br />
Kaylee turned one ear to listen into room where her parents were. Her father was still talking to someone on the phone, but it sounded like he was getting to the end of the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they're getting closer to finishing up the employment and club membership functions,&quot; Kaylee commented, &quot;although I wonder about the house and the furniture...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That will have to sit abandoned,&quot; Jensen dismissed it, &quot;besides, it's not any of us has any explicit need for furniture or clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee slowly nodded, &quot;of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Things were quiet for a few moments before Fran asked impatiently, &quot;how much longer?&quot;</p>
