<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And so the game went on with you and Luna taking turns worshiping the other&#39;s feet while the other took their turn, and it was something that you enjoyed and let you indulge in your own fetishes for a bit, and feeling Luna&#39;s tongue wrap around your toes and lick the pads on your toes and the base of the paw gave you some hint that Luna had been honest when she made her own admission/discovery the previous night. Though some of it also had its own details. For in MILF-wolf form, yours and Luna&#39;s feet were canine in appearance and your ability to stand on two feet when walking had more to do with the strength and balance coming from your hips rather than anything from your feet. In this the fur covered skin between your pads and ankle were pulled tight and in this the foot there wasn&#39;t &quot;wrinkled.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pads were a different issue. In some ways they LOOKED like they would be wrinkled, but the pads were something animals like wolves would be able to move about without shoes and would protect their feet from sharp rocks, thorns, or other things which would cut the soft skin of human feet rather easily and why humans wore shoes when they went outside. The pads in yours and Luna&#39;s feet had hardened and worked like the pads of any mundane wolf&#39;s pads. In this, anything that looked like wrinkles were more something that would appear with an aged animal... a crack in the pad. The only thing that would show the difference between you and Luna from an old wolf was that the &quot;cracks&quot; in your pads weren&#39;t sharp and weren&#39;t painful. It was like your pads folded inward and thus created the look of wrinkles and Luna&#39;s pads had the same feature. Though you didn&#39;t care about those details all that much.<br />
<br />
You simply balanced your attention to Luna&#39;s feet while she rolled the dice and took her turn and then alternated to roll the dice when it was your turn to move your piece on the board. There had been some worries in your mind about the Wolf Hunters given your stepmom&#39;s warning and the city&#39;s confirmation that the police were notified that it was possible that the Wolf Hunters would be on their way to town, if they weren&#39;t in town. For since the rules regarding the registration of MILF-wolves could make it easy to know where MILF-wolves lived if one knew where to look and checked those online records. Not everyone checked them, as you hadn&#39;t checked them, but the Wolf Hunters had a reputation of being the sort to try that sort of thing. That was something that worried you and likely did worry Luna, particularly with Kellie and Roxie out for the night, but so far nothing of that nature seemed to happen. You didn&#39;t hear any windows be broken and neither you nor Luna saw any shadows moving through the window over the kitchen sink.<br />
<br />
There also wasn&#39;t any other guests or interruptions as the two of you played. Some of it might be understandable, as a lot of people didn&#39;t often go out at night, often to avoid unnecessary run ins with werewolves hunting deer or even MILF-wolves doing the same, but you knew that Luna had a fair number of friends from high school and there could be the potential for some of them to want to hang out. Some people might argue that they might obey things like curfews, but then some might not. After all, you knew that Luna had one very good friend that would break curfew to be with her and he became a MILF-wolf named Nicki... and in other words, you. But as the two of you played through the game and there was no interruption.<br />
<br />
Of course this also took time, and some of this was to be expected. Because the game was only you versus Luna this time around, it took more time to play through to the end of the game, and not just because both you and Luna enjoyed the attention from getting your feet worshiped while taking your turns. For with only two people in the game, that then made it harder, particularly at the start to then land on any early properties that you or Luna had purchased, and the further you went around the board the more difficult it was to buy the more expensive spots on the board and thus had to pass by them in order to collect whenever one of you passed &quot;go.&quot; It was only once the two of you be began to get around the board a few times that you were able to afford some of the more &quot;expensive&quot; blocks on the board and run into situations where you would land on a block that one or the other of you owned.<br />
<br />
&quot;This has been nice,&quot; Luna said as she started one turn, &quot;there have been no emergencies, no sirens, and no one coming to the doors... just me and my mate... having fun together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... normally the town is pretty quiet,&quot; you replied as licked at the paw pad underneath Luna&#39;s foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Luna nodded, &quot;and even with the potential threat of the Wolf Hunters... a quiet night good. And your attention is enough to have me enjoy it and look forward to a good night.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then took your turn and nodded as you took your turn, &quot;and it has been good for fun between us. Particularly as it&#39;s been a way for us to have our own girls night in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna smiled and the two of you kept playing and alternating in those sessions of worshiping the other&#39;s foot depending on who&#39;s turn it was. It was something that allowed you both to enjoy the time together and avoid having to worry about things. Those worries might return later, but for now it was simply good to have some fun. The real questions left was who would win and when.</p>
