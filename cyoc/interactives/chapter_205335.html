<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frederick summoned a bunch of cards into his hand, starting the game with a simple quiz.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which timeline is this one?&quot;, he asked, before realizing what he had just said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Timeline two!&quot;, declared Anton as he pressed his button. He frowned. &quot;How do I know that? Timelines exist?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Frederick whistled,&quot;Don&#39;t think about it. Time stuff only causes headaches. It may be related to this timeline technically happening later in the meta-timeline. Again, don&#39;t think about.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rex&#39;s hands grew a layer of red fur as the skin hardened and nails became black claws. He took it in stride.&quot; I can make this work.&quot;<br />
<br />
The next question was soon asked,&quot;On which day did the first moon landing happen?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;On the 16th of July 1969!&quot;, declared Rex as he pressed his buzzer. <br />
<br />
A sad tune eminated from the screen behind them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Incorrect. They landed on the 20th.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon the red fur started spreading up Rex&#39;s arms and the skin under it became an exoskeleton. <br />
<br />
He felt uncomfortable as he took off his shoes, revealing that his toes had merged into two claws per foot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok?&quot;, asked Anton. <br />
<br />
Rex sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess I did this to myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frederick nodded, drawing the next card,&quot;Who was the last loser of this show and who were they turned into?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anton smashed his buzzer before Rex could. It was so loud that a electrician quickly came in from offstage and checked on the buzzer. All of the eyes on him made Anton feel very ashamed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think it was that baron guy, whose whole thing was his title and he became an anthro termite queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct, a very curvy queen at that. I think she is building a hive on the outskirts of the city now.&quot;<br />
<br />
From his arms and feet spread the red fur like a flame to his torso and along his legs, covering most of it. Exoskeleton also took hold there. <br />
<br />
&quot;This feels weird, yet somehow nice. Wow, my strength went up by two from that alone! This is actually kinda cool.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to see that you are enjoying yourself ...but you do know I am straight, Rex. If you were to become my perfect partner you would also become...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot;, exclaimed Rex, suddenly realizing what the exact stakes were. For a short second he asked himself if he would care though.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a hologram projector appeared between the podiums of the players. It was a new addition to the show and especially Anton seemed amazed by it. <br />
<br />
Frederick explained,&quot;In the coming game you must defeat the evil transformation sorcerer, who looks suspiciously like me, and his army of servants. You can both lose or win this one. You play as a team this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The buzzers on the podiums became joysticks and buttons for the duration of the game.<br />
<br />
They actually did rather well at the beginning, climbing multiple floors of the tower. <br />
<br />
Rex&#39;s character was transformed into a pretty bee woman on floor 4 by eating the wrong honey and then jumped Anton&#39;s character, turning him into her king.<br />
<br />
Blue scales grew on Antons feet and hands. His nails also lengthened and became black, but the changes stopped there. <br />
<br />
Rex&#39;s legs became longer, curvier as his waist and shoulders narrowed. Fat from his stomach traveled to his butt, where it bubbled into a round shape. The red fur from his torso spread up his neck to his head and so every part of his body had been covered in some kind of hair. <br />
<br />
He checked on himself and viewed his model on the screen. &quot;This is not that bad actually. I feel...strong and my ass was deficient anyway. Maybe...next question.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frederick smiled,&quot;I like your enthusiasm. So, what is the lifespan of an ant queen?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Anything from 2 to 20 years!&quot;, exclaimed Anton upon hitting his buzzer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yet again correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rex&#39;s adam&#39;s apple disappeared, leaving him with a deeper, femenin voice. His body continued becoming more like that of a woman as his hips widened and thighs thickened. An embarrassing moan escaped his lips as his member became smaller. His hair lengthened down to his shoulders, becoming obsidian of color. His strength and charisma increased again and to his pleasure, he gained another ten centimeters of height. <br />
<br />
Anton felt a bit of pity for his friend. &quot;Are you still alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rex laughed in his deep, almost seductive voice. &quot;I feel alright. Very alright actually~&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at Anton gave him strange butterflies in his stomach. <br />
<br />
Fuck it. He was doubling down on this.<br />
<br />
And so the next game came up. It was a transformation themed strategy game. <br />
<br />
Rex didn&#39;t take multiple chances to beat Anton and left his flank open multiple times, loosing on purpose. <br />
<br />
He smiled as his eyes became the same obsidian color as his hair. His features softened as his nose disappeared. Two antennae sprung from between his hair as he giggled. Soon his ears also became nothing but two holes. His member disappeared and was replaced with it&#39;s female counterpart, while he moaned. Two peaks grew from his chest, becoming small breasts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rex pointed at his model on the screen, in particular something below his name. <br />
<br />
&quot;Change those pronouns to she/her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frederick looked surprised as Anton&#39;s mouth gaped. &quot;Sure. This is the fastest I have seen someone accept their genderbending ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
She needed to continue loosing. She felt great. So strong...so pretty.<br />
<br />
Before Frederick could even end his next question answered Rex,&quot;Kazakhstan!&quot;<br />
<br />
The host looked perplexed,&quot;I didn&#39;t even end my sentence. Wrong, the answer is an egg covered in vanilla extract.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rex smiled as her breasts expanded by a couple sizes, straining her shirt, which ripped as a second pair of arms grew from her sides. Her middriff was exposed as her shirt now resembled more of a bra. <br />
<br />
Her pants ripped, not being able to contain her growing butt, legs and hips. Before her groin could be uncovered  some panties appeared on her body. <br />
<br />
Most of the audience groaned in disappointment as they didn&#39;t get to view between her legs. <br />
<br />
She blew Anton a kiss as she noticed him staring. He turned away, blushing. He was so cute...so handsome. She blushed as she had a short thought of his head between her legs. <br />
<br />
Anton looked over to Frederick. &quot;Are you making him...her act like this?&quot; <br />
<br />
Frederick shook his head,&quot;This is entirely her doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot;, exclaimed Rex, jumping around. &quot;This is awesome! Anton, you can stare by the way. Just don&#39;t touch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anton hid behind his podium, blushing. <br />
<br />
The next question went down in a similar way. Rex answered some nonsense and Frederick sighed. <br />
<br />
An abdomen grow out from above her butt. Rex imagined it being swollen with eggs... . <br />
<br />
Black butterfly wings stretched out from her shoulders. She stared in glee and gave them a couple happy flapps, before doing a victory dance. <br />
<br />
Rex showed off her new proboscus, shoving it out off her mouth for a moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;If this is used for sucking nectar imagine what it could do with a...ugh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frederick and Anton ran over to Rex, who fell over, clutching her head. The intelligence stat on the screen went up all the way to 9 as she went through the worst migraine of her life.<br />
<br />
The two men helped her up. <br />
<br />
Anton took her shoulder with his pretty little hands and asked her if she was ok. He was so caring and his scent made her groin tingle. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am fine...actually. I...holy shit. It is as if there was a cloud over my mind, which had suddenly been lifted. I can...do complex math in my head now.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked around the massive room. Anton asked if she was fine. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know so much more now. I can look at any given thing and understand it completely. I know what those seats are made off...I know...&quot;<br />
<br />
Flames appeared on each of her four hands before disappearing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I CAN DO MAGIC!&quot;, she exclaimed happily before turning to Anton and kissing him on his cheek. Her four arms drew hin in, pressing him up against her breasts. <br />
<br />
She laughed as he looked up at her, straining in her grasp. &quot;Enjoy it. I am definitely doing so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frederick announced,&quot;The transformation is over. Anton has won, earning both a million TF-Coins and apparently a lovely new partner.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned to Anton and Rex. &quot;Do you want to watch your alternate reality selves?&quot; <br />
<br />
Anton stopped resisting her grasp as he stared into her loving eyes, affection for the woman of his dreams blooming. She was perfect. Pretty, strong and intelligent, what could one desire more. Rex would be more than his friend now. The man had taken to becoming his girlfriend in stride. While she was acting very horny right now, she appeared to have actual affection for him. So, he pressed his head deeper into her chest, enjoying her warm touch. <br />
<br />
She giggled. &quot;No, I want to take MY man here to a date. I know a lovely club. Do you want that, Anton?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot;, he told, feeling embarrassed as he kissed her. <br />
<br />
Frederick waved as everyone cheered the couple walking off stage. <br />
<br />
The butterfly and the human walked through the building. Anton felt a bit concerned. &quot;Are you feeling well. You are acting...weirdly is an understatement.&quot;<br />
<br />
She giggled again,&quot;I feel very nice,handsome. I assure you, this is still me, your friend Rex. I just have a much hotter and more intelligent body now. It&#39;s still me under that shell, plus an unreasonable attraction to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so.&quot;,he said uncertainly. <br />
<br />
She stopped before meeting his eyes and taking on a soothing tone. &quot;I am fine. I love this body. I love...you. Please, just let me take you to a club. Let&#39;s dance, swing our hips and have some fun. Do you not want to dance with the woman of your dreams?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do. I just wanted to be sure I didn&#39;t mind wipe my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
He kissed her as she put a hand around his waist. And so they trailed off to go enjoy themselves. <br />
<br />
As they left the building Anton said,&quot;You still haven&#39;t admitted it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed,&quot;Ugh...insects are better.&quot;<br />
<br />
He laughed to her dismay.</p>
