<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I am taking a little license with the premise. This branch is from the thought that one can sign over the curse and its affects as items that convey with ownership of land on the island. Similarly, the curse is lifted when one no longer &quot;owns&quot; the land.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Geoff was a newly retired fifty-five year old, married for thirty seven years to the only girl he dated in high school, Sarah. Geoff wanted to buy a house and move to a far off island. Their own children had moved away when they went to college and found better places to go than the small Kansas town where Geoff grew up and worked his entire life. Prices for homes in these far off places were much too high for Geoff and Sarah. They found a particular listing one evening, the house looked nice, it was close to the beach, and had all they had to do was swap their house and property, it was too good to be true at first. Sarah saw the photos of the islanders, and gave Geoff a difficult time for wanting a place where such large breasts were on frequent display.<br />
<br />
The woman who placed the ad turned out to be quite sincere and genuine. Patricia had lived on the island since she was born, but had no children and wanted to return home to the place her parents were from, the mainland United States. Geoff was looking for &quot;the catch&quot;, and Patricia said the only catch is you have to make the island their home the same as it was for her. The island properties could only be owned by residents, though you could sublet the house, as long as you were still on the island. Patricia and Geoff worked out the deed swap, where he and Sarah would fly to the island, Patricia would sign over the deed to Geoff and Sarah for her house and property, and then Geoff and Sarah would sign over their home of thirty years to Patricia. Patricia even paid for an international moving company to transport Geoff and Sarah&#39;s stuff to their new home. Patricia wanted nothing from her house, and was leaving everything except some photos and keepsakes from her parents.<br />
<br />
The day the movers came, Geoff and Sarah emptied the house, as Patricia said she would buy here own. That night the couple slept in an empty house, bags packed for a week to see the kids and their families before flying to the island. The visits with the kids went well, they were all interested in coming to visit where they never showed any interest before. A week after leaving their modest Kansas house, they were talking face to face with Patricia at the airport, who was in baggage claim to meet them. A muscular Patricia helped the couple with their luggage and the taxi took them to a pier. Geoff and Sarah were surprised, and Sarah asked &quot;Is this not the island?&quot;<br />
<br />
Patricia smiled, &quot;This is a large island, with lots of tourists. Your new home is about ten miles away, you can see it once we get out into open water. Don&#39;t worry, this little boat comes with the house.&quot; The little boat was a 32 foot sailboat. Geoff and Sarah got their luggage loaded while Patricia was busy preparing the rigging. Soon, Geoff pushed off and did his best to get on the job sailing lesson&#39;s from Patricia. Patricia made it look easy, but there were a few occasions where Sarah could see under Patricia&#39;s skirt, and she swore she saw a rather large bulge between Patricia&#39;s muscular legs. Geoff was having his own trouble paying attention to the pulleys and which line did what thing as he was enamored with Patricia&#39;s cleavage on display after she took off her blouse for the trip to the island. The island in the distance looked large, but Patricia explained there was a lagoon in the center, and their new house was on the lagoon beach. Patricia was excellent in her reflexes and catching the wind, as she docked in her slip in the small marina in just under an hour. Geoff saw no other men around, and just a few women, just like the photos. Geoff helped Patricia tie up the boat before helping them unload their luggage.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you look right through those palm trees,&quot; Patricia pointed at a small grove of palms just over 600 yards away before continuing, &quot;that is your new house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah was surprised at how close the house was, and how narrow this part of the island was. Patricia mentioned that just as she had before, that there was no electricity on the island, but there was solar, windmills, and batteries for the well and lights. On this part of the island, the houses, what few there were, were spaced farther apart. There was a paved road, but no cars. Once inside the home, Sarah was starting to be at ease. She was worried about the no electricity thing, but the house had a large solar array and a couple of good size windmills to keep the batteries charge and run the house. Patricia helped the couple inside with their luggage, and Geoff pulled out their deed while Patricia produced hers. They signed over each other&#39;s properties as they discussed, which Patricia taking her new deed to her packed luggage, a single bag.<br />
<br />
Patricia picked up her bag, shook Geoff and Sarah&#39;s hands, and wished them all the best and asked if they had any more questions that they did not already cover in their buyer&#39;s calls or the nearly forty page disclosure form Patricia emailed Sarah. Patricia smiled at the couple as they felt they had no questions. Patricia said, &quot;The phone service here is tied to the house, so when I get to Kansas and get a phone, I&#39;ll call you to check in, just in case.&quot; Geoff and Sarah nodded, and a few moments later, the couple were now busy touring their new house.<br />
<br />
Geoff looked to Sarah, and said &quot;Wow....it&#39;s better in person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah was in awe still, &quot;I never imagined this would be us one day, our own house on the water.&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff let Sarah look around some more before leading her by the hand to the bedroom, to christen their new bed as a loving couple should.</p>
