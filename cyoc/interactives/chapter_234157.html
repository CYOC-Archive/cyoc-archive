<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After our owner of the book went to bed the hours passed and the night was already heavy, more than 3 in the morning. Without knowing it, the door to his apartment began to open without him knowing. A hooded figure entered his house without realizing it. Given the changes made by the book that had turned gays into alpha males, it was obvious that this guy was straight, being no taller than 5&#39;1&quot; and was really thin.<br />
<br />
The thief, Marcus, a boy from the building next door who liked to steal from the golden children who paid good rent who paid for the building.<br />
<br />
Marcus began searching the apartment looking for valuable things but was surprised to find that the apartment was a lacking of gold or pretty stuff. Marcus gasped as he saw just a few things like a laptop and an old book on a desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it&#39;s best than nothing...&quot; Marcus said and started to take these objects with a few things as a pretty clock that was in the wall.<br />
<br />
Marcus left the house trying to go unnoticed until he returned to his building. On the way Marcus looked at the large advertisements that were seen in the city, most of the advertisements for &quot;men&#39;s things&quot; such as deodorant or sports were starring gays. The new reality that the previous owner had created had made gays in this world stronger, taller, etc. They were the most interested group in areas such as sports so you could see how they starred alongside busty supermodels. <br />
<br />
Marcus felt some anger knowing that no matter how hard he tried he would never be as big as a gay man, much less as attractive to girls as one. For the young thief, it was frustrating that the prettiest girls preferred to spend time with a man who would never show the slightest interest in them in his life.<br />
<br />
The young thief arrived home, a place not as nice as the one he had robbed but at least it was ok, the boy took off the big jacket he was wearing and where he had kept a pair of earrings and rings that he stole from two other apartments he had stolen the same night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rich people do have horrible tastes&quot; Marcus said that while he saw heart rings and food-shaped earrings. The young thief preferred the &quot;Edgy&quot; aesthetic, colors like black, red, green and purple; skulls, big boots, etc. The middle point between &quot;emo&quot; and &quot;goth&quot;.<br />
<br />
Marcus sighed when he saw how inside the small loot there was nothing of interest to tell the truth. He had started stealing not out of economic necessity but because the landlord of his apartment gave him the order for helping to lower the reputation of the building next door. A silly motivation but one that for personal reasons the young man could not deny.<br />
<br />
Marcus left his things on the table and went to take a bath. In the mirror the boy over 26 saw himself, he was thin but not starving, hairless, with shoulder-length black hair. When she took off his clothes, his light body showed a couple of scars already healed but with visible marks and his penis was a little smaller than average in size. The young man always felt insecure about his body for a very simple reason. Due to his personality, tastes and body, he was not popular with girls.<br />
<br />
The former owner of the book will have eliminated homophobia and similar problems, but things like envy of other people&#39;s achievements are something that humanity urgently has. Marcus was no exception, he was always envious of how his homosexual classmates were so tall and athletic while ironically popular with girls. More than one memory of seeing girls gathering next to a homo hunk to touch his muscles even if everyone knew they were never going to get any action. The young Goth was burning with envy, not the kind that makes you violent but the kind that makes you angry and then depressed.<br />
<br />
After taking a bath he came out, the only good side of his apartment was that he was alone and the windows were covered because Marcus liked his privacy so he used to walk around naked and it was the only time when he felt comfortable with his body.<br />
<br />
Marcus put the loot back in his bag and took out the book with the rules of the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this shit?&quot; The young man snapped as he opened it.<br />
<br />
The book showed the sections that the previous owner had left, in the section on human sexuality. Marcus looked through the book without knowing its condition and simply thought that it was a book on biology, sociology or any other subject that the university student takes in his classes.<br />
<br />
Marcus couldn&#39;t help but grimace when he read what he already knew but hated for being true.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you change it?&quot; That thought hit his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that would be silly, I&#39;m not a child&quot; Marcus tried to reason.<br />
<br />
After a couple of seconds the young Gothic man couldn&#39;t help but fall into temptation, at the end of the day it doesn&#39;t matter what he did to the book. The things he stole he sold or threw away, the book was not going to be different. Marcus took paper and pencil and decided to mainly put notes in the margins that would unknowingly change the world.<br />
<br />
On things like the size of the largest penis in homosexuals for example he put a footnote.<br />
<br />
&quot;The latter turned out to be a lie, the size of homosexual men is actually smaller than that of heterosexual men&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus laughed silly, for him this was nothing more than a little child&#39;s &quot;revenge&quot; but it made him laugh stupidly.<br />
<br />
The young thief decided to go a little further.<br />
<br />
&quot;On a sociological level, it is seen how men with tendencies towards punk or alternative culture (Edgy) turn out to meet all the characteristics of an alpha male, from measurements and proportions to psychological profile&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus continued writing without stopping to see how the book was rewriting the information to fit what he was writing down. All the changes that the previous owner had made in favor of gays now belonged not even to heterosexuals but to members of the &quot;Goth&quot;, &quot;Punk&quot;, &quot;Emo&quot;, &quot;Metal&quot; and similar subcultures.<br />
<br />
The young thief, after a short while, decided to leave his trick there and closed the book. He suddenly began to feel tired all over his body but he attributed it to tiredness from being a thief so he went straight to his bed while the world changed behind him.<br />
<br />
After a night where the universe changed the previous owner as well as the actions, they had to wake up and...</p>
