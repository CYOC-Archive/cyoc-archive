<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Note I am changing this to second person from Isaac&#39;s perspective because I am used to writing/typing stories like that.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhg, damn it, fine I accept just get rid on this curse.&quot; You said, and Flora responded,&quot;Good, it will be nice to have someone to talk to for the next eternity.&quot; Flora then put her claw on Your giant member, and you suddenly blacked out as a mist emerged from your dick when it Flora touched it.<br />
<br />
You awoke inside a next in a large cave dazed, and exhausted for some reason. Your vision was blurred for a few moments but it recovered within seconds to see Flora was sitting right next to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, I would tell you but what fun would that be? Besides I had to remove your dick anyways, and I did say that your humanity was beyond saving.&quot; Flora said smiling at you.<br />
<br />
You looked down at your body in shock, and saw that you were now female, and what&#39;s more is that you are a dragon covered in green scales, and moss was growing moss on your back. &quot;I...I&#39;m like you...I&#39;m a dragoness, why Flora?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the real question is why not? You as a regular animal, a female animal would be useless and probably get killed within the first week. But like this I can show you the ropes of being like me, a proud, and beautiful nature dragoness like myself. Who knows maybe you can find someone who&#39;s willing to accept what you did.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I don&#39;t know what to say exactly, I can&#39;t go back to my old life as a paladin now.&quot; You said giving Flora a worried look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about your old life, and try to embrace this one the best you can. Trust me, humans are no good for us, no good for nature, so I created this place to show them that. I admit I was young and ignorant when I did so your condition wasn&#39;t entirely intended. So now I dwell here, feeding on the animals around this temple, and for some reason my curses that I said outside have been altered in a way, and you proved that to me. For what it&#39;s worth I&#39;m sorry for my actions, but forgiveness for me beyond what I deserve at this point.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
You thought for a moment thinking,&quot;She&#39;s responsible for my dick doing that earlier, but it was an accident, but she&#39;s the reason why your a dragon now, and female. But Flora feels bad for you, is offering to help you, and claims that her magic is being altered.&quot; You shook your head seeing that she&#39;s living in grief of her own actions and is trying to make up for that by giving offers to those like you.<br />
<br />
You turned to Flora who was looking down at the ground depressed, so you said,&quot;Flora, in the rainforest with those vines, what were they supposed to do?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Entangle, and transform the victim into fruit and those fruit would then become trees for the animals to feed on their fruit. You were caught up in them weren&#39;t you?&quot; Flora asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...yes, but before I came here I remember seeing someone who offered to remove the curse, and a sketchy one at that. It was a witch who said she would remove the curse by removing my dick, and I refused and continued on underestimating the condition I was in.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then it looks like you found one of our culprits, if she knew how to undo the curse like I did that means she altered my magic somehow. By the way I also removed your dick physically, and it&#39;s taking root, and growing like a tree. I suspect that the gnats will love it.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
You looked down at your clit, and felt aroused of the thought of a giant dick tree for some reason. &quot;Huh, that sounds like one odd tree. But what do we do about that hag?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if we see someone we could persuade them to kill her, but we don&#39;t have that many options offensive wise in magic. We would most likely die if we would attempt it ourselves.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well in that case what exactly do we do then, and what kind of name should I choose?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything plant related, but I believe a good one for you is Orchid, because I noticed a vine growing on your tail that will soon blossom. Your lucky, the bees are going to adore your flowers, and you can make fruit too, and I can help you with caring for it too. Don&#39;t worry about the bees hurting either, they see us as a force more powerful than their own queens.&quot; Flora said <br />
<br />
You looked back and saw a long vine working around your tail, and cradling the base of your tail just about your asshole. &quot;Huh, I like Orchid as a name, oh what about when we need to piss, or take a shit? What do we do about that?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;A common question one would ask, and the answer is do it near a tree, or an area with a sapling. Our waste gives lots of nutrients to the plants this way, and our shit makes the soil extra fertile. You actually should release your waste soon too, you&#39;ve been out for about 2 weeks. So go ahead your tree is just outside, and you can&#39;t miss it.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
You got up and rushed outside the cave clenching what you could of your bladder, and you saw a giant green dick sticking up out of the ground without it&#39;s fruity balls. You couldn&#39;t hold it anymore so you sauatted down next to the dick and let everything loose. Your piss seemed to have an effect on the land beneath it as the soil turned greener, and you took what felt the biggest shit of your life. You looked behind you and saw a 2 foot pile of shit behind behind you, and it seemed oddly soft.<br />
<br />
Flora then walked up next to you, and over at your pile of shit and smiled. &quot;Wow that&#39;s a nice pile, and it seems to be the just the right softness for our needs.&quot; Flora said, and you looked at her puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Humans do it all the time with cows, and our manure, as humans say, is the better than a cows by far. So just spreading it around your tree, and follow me when you&#39;re done, but don&#39;t wipe your claws off. I&#39;ll show you what we do.&quot; Flora said as she took a small section from your mushy shit, and spread it around your dick tree.<br />
<br />
You were disgusted about what Flora just did, but your instincts told you that she was right. So you slowly reached into your pile and picked up a large clump of your own shit, and began spreading it around the base of the dick tree. &quot;Your getting it, just make sure to spread evenly. I&#39;ll help you with the cleaning yourself up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m disgusted by this,&quot; you commented <br />
<br />
&quot;I know it&#39;s not the prettiest thing we have to do, but it&#39;s worth it considering the clean up and the fact that your tree will benefit almost immediately from it. We should see changes rapidly in it too, here I&#39;ll help you with the rest.&quot; Flora said as she picked up and glob of your shit and began spreading it around.<br />
<br />
After you were done Flora gestured for you to follow her, and you did so and the both of you ended up near a dirt area and had considerably prosperous plant life. &quot;Here we are now we just lay down and wait for some very small helpers that I know.&quot; Flora said laying on her side, and you did too.<br />
<br />
&quot;So who is helping us exactly in this situation?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean what is helping us, and they will be here shortly because they can smell very well. But let me take this time to explain to you a few rules about us. As Nature dragons we are not feared by insects, or animals, and they help us in many ways. That being said you should never, and I am serious when I say never intentionally harm anything or anyone unless they attack you first. Insects and animals take notice to such things and will retaliate if you do, as a natural instinct towards us unless you don&#39;t take notice and they will see that as an unintended action. What we are doing now is an example of mutualism Orchid, just watch I can see them already.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
You looked down at your claws and saw insects walking up to you claws, and crawling onto them. You felt a tickling sensation on your claws, and you couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. &quot;What&#39;s happening Flora?&quot; You asked getting used to the sensation. &quot;Dung beetles is what&#39;s happening they take what leftover dung we have on our claws and do what they want with it. For them it&#39;s either eating or rolling it into a ball for their eggs, so we benefit from them cleaning us, and they benefit by acquiring a source of nutrients from our dung. Some may go after the dung we spread around your tree, but it&#39;s fine.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
The tickling sensation then stopped seconds later, and you saw a total of five dung beetles rolling a giant ball of poop, going away from you. &quot;Finished, I know the first lesson wasn&#39;t the most pleasing to you, but it&#39;s important nonetheless. Also a rule of thumb is that we can&#39;t hunt either, but our moss gives us sustenance as it grows, and your flowers and fruit will too. Also we&#39;re both omnivores so we can eat fruit easily, the sharp teeth up front are just for show in my opinion, and I&#39;ve never really used them before. Your tree also seems to sprout fruit quite often, and it&#39;s actually pretty good. I&#39;d give you some but it seems like it lacks a lengthy ripeness, and only lasts about a week. Your other fruits were overripe too so I gave them to the flies, but your tree should be blossoming new fruit soon.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...I don&#39;t feel like eating something that came from a dick that was once mine.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Orchid, it&#39;s fine but you&#39;re really missing out. Also it seems that your penis has abandoned its regular functions too, so it&#39;s fruit is completely safe for consumption.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe after I get over the fact that what is now a tree in the ground, was attached to me an producing semen.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit, now we just need to drink water, and your tail should prosper along with your moss. I feel kind of jealous too, because of your tail&#39;s vines too.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
You looked back at your tail again,&quot;Oh uh thanks, I guess that kind of takes away from the fact that we both smell like dung now.&quot; You said chuckling <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, but that goes away thanks to our natural musk, and scent.&quot; Flora said<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what now?&quot; You asked</p>
