<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being slightly distracted from seeing the sweeper Jen suddenly felt her feet slip as she lost balance from the wet floor and fell forward towards the counter. Her reactions weren&#39;t fast enough to prevent her fall so her arms lunged forward smacking her all her parts and launching them off the counter while she caught the edge with her hands and had the wind knocked out of her from the hard impact her of abdomen on the counter. Holding on to the counter she steadied herself before she stood up but was quite captivated by the vacuum. &quot;If I stretched as much as I did from the water and balloon, would the suction of the vacuum still work?!&quot; She thought excitedly. <br />
<br />
Having a solid stance she let go of the counter and righted herself and proceeded to walk around the kitchen island. Walking felt weird to her since her inverted canal was hanging down with nothing on the end of it and she wanted to fix that at least. Not knowing where her parts landed she looked down and found her vaginal opening immediately. She tried putting that back put her vagina just would go back inside. Looking around she saw her uterus and walked over to it then bent over to pick it up. On her return upward she noticed the vacuum was within arms reach. Her curiosity got the better of her, and she decided to forego the idea of putting things back to normal. She set her parts on a nearby table and returned to the vacuum and inspected it. As she inspected it there was nothing unique, just a standard vacuum it had a dust collector, floor brush, attached hose with attachments, wheels, power button and power cord. Jen thought about it and how she would swap pieces parts as she disassembled the vacuum. To her surprise she could pull it apart with no worrying about the smaller pieces and could reassemble it just as easy. <br />
<br />
Now with vacuum prepped all she had to do was attach it to herself. First she thought about how to get the engine inside her and connect all the parts for it to work. Then she remembered her gaping donut hole and thought maybe she could separate her intestine from the opening. So with one hand she plunged it inside her hole with ease pinched the walls and with the other hand reached just inside her hole and grabbed it. Pulling in opposite directions kinda hurt and then there was a loud pop, as she felt the two separate. She then reached for her bladder and pulled it out completely. As she stood there looking at it she felt empty down south it wasn&#39;t painful. Next she grabbed the engine and retractable cord and pushed it up her donut hole stretching it even more. Her hole gave way as it and her hand sunk into her body. Grabbing the plug she pulled it out as she removed her hand which was now covered in pink icing. The plug fell to the ground next she grabbed her uterus and removed the ovaries which left the tubes open then proceeded to connect her uterus to her inverted vagina. As soon as she connected her uterus everything was sucked in like the first time with the balloon. Now she had to connect one tube of her uterus to the engine so she reached through her donut hole grabbed the tube and felt around the engine finding the hole for it and touched the open end of the tube to it. Instantly her tube fused to the engine and she could feel the cord on the floor. Looking at the other parts her eyes rested on the power button and giggled as she grabbed it. A quick pinch and pull of her clit with her free hand it popped off and she placed the power button in its place. Then she took her other uterine tube and connected it to her urethra opening. Jen then took the last two parts and attached the hose to her urethra opening and connected the dust collector to her vagina for easy access. Now she could feel everything and it was wild. There wasn&#39;t an outlet nearby that she could see, so she decided to test the retractable cord. Reaching behind her she grabbed a hold of it and gave a tug and to her shock she felt the rapid movement of the coil and cord as it was sucked into her body. She could feel moisture on the cord and out of curiosity she grabbed it and pulled it in front of her being shocked by the feeling of the cord and coil releasing through her backside. Upon inspection she saw the cord was covered in pink icing. That&#39;s no good I can&#39;t plug it in like that, and thought for a couple of seconds. An idea struck her and she rectracted the cord while holding onto the plug until her hand hit her donut hole. Clenching her home shut she took her free hand and pinched it then pulled with a pop it was free. Her idea worked as she could feel her plug compressed in her hand and the donut touching it. Jen let go of the plug and pulled the donut down freeing both donut and plug. Her plug didn&#39;t feel moist and slightly sticky anymore so she picked up her hose then went looking for an outlet. Before long she found one that was easily accessible. She stood there a bit hesitant but her excitement took over as she reached around grabbed the plug between her cheeks and pulled which gave her happy tingles as she felt her new body working as it should so far. It was the moment of truth with the plug in hand she reached out and inserted her plug in the outlet. As she did she could feel the prongs of her plug slide into the hole and then was overcome with wild sensations as her plug was seated fully and electricity surged through it instantly. Her body tensed from the initial jolt and tightened a lot as she was being shocked, with her surprise nothing happened with the vacuum then she realized it needed to be turned on. She managed to move her stiff arm around to a position she could press her button. As she touched it she felt normal pleasure and as she pressed it in her body relaxed from an instant orgasm as the electricity surged into the engine and it began to purr within her and felt a huge rush of air into her hose. <br />
<br />
Jens belly bloated with air she could feel it spin around in her dust collector. She couldn&#39;t believe that she was now effectively a human vacuum and had a strong urge to do some cleaning. She grabbed her hose which didn&#39;t feel like much on the outside but it sure felt nice on the inside and pointed it towards the first thing she saw, the donut. The hiss from the air grew sharper as it approached the table and donut. When her hose got within inches the donut lurched and suddenly smacked her hose tip giving her a jolt of pleasure while air hissed loudly as it squeezed past the donut. It didn&#39;t seem anything was going to happen since the donut was to big for the hose but she was wrong. She could feel the sucking power increase gradually and she squeeked as the donut lurched into her hose a bit and pressure increased more. Her eyes were locked on the donut as it barely creeped into the hose, as the pressure increased her pleasure built and in an instant she squealed loudly from an intense orgasm and collapsed to the floor as she heard a loud FWOMP and the donut was sucked through her sensitive hose at a high speed slamming into her uterus then instantly hurled through her love canal then slamming into the bottom of her dust collector. <br />
<br />
Laying on the ground she came to after her orgasm and looked down between her legs at her dust clear dust collector. Jen could barely wrap her mind around the intense feeling of pleasure coursing through her body and comprehending not only the feeling of but the sight that malformed donut that was just sucked into her body. She finally stood up and had to do that again!</p>
