<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While he first thought to turn the house into a mansion, the sentence he obtained gave him a better idea. &quot;Timothy Melnick lives in this house with his roommates.&quot; Sure, with that he could effectively make them live in a mansion, but nobody said under which condition. What if they were just house-sitting for some rich but demanding people? Or worst, if one of his roommates was owning the manor but only housed them if they all accepted some unreasonable conditions?<br />
<br />
In another time-line, Timothy would have replaced his roommates with a girlfriend, or even girlfriends. But in this one, while that idea briefly popped into his mind, the idea of multiple lover woke up his libido, which rapidly got the better of him. As a result, he made the phrase on his phone become &quot;Timothy Melnick lives in this house with his succubi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Somehow, it made him <strong>own</strong> the resulting succubi, as his <strong>slaves</strong>.<br />
<br />
In this new reality, some peoples were summoners, peoples able to force demons to appear on Earth, turning said demons into their slaves. Timothy was now such a person and specialized into enslaving succubi, which he based his businesses around. You could go to him and rent a succubus the same way you could a car or a home. He wasn&#39;t the only one to do it, nor was he the guy with the more succubi, but he had a reputation on not only having the sexiest succubi in town, but also to take great care of their physical health.<br />
<br />
How did he know all this about his new reality? Like most people in that business he had ordered one of his succubus to reverse-possess him. You all heard of a demonic possession, having a demon taking over your body, controlling, leaving you a spectator of your own life? A reverse-possession is the exact inverse, the demon make you enter and take control of their body, turning themselves into a spectator of their own life. Not something demons would do on their own free will but, as a summoned succubus, she couldn&#39;t disobey her master. As a result, Timothy had access to all her knowledge and memories, also being her owner. (Albeit his case is a bit special, but more on that latter.)<br />
<br />
That practice of always taking over the body of one of the demon they own serve as a &quot;viewing sample&quot; for potential customers. In the case of Timothy, most customers wanted sex, (What would you rent a succubus for?) but some were non-summoners wanting to experiences reverse-possession, wish is dangerous when you&#39;re not the one owning the demon. Naturally, the law forced him to warn his customers, which he did, but some didn&#39;t listen to said warning and whore the rented succubus&#39; body all the time. Inevitably, such a person would end up becoming a demon of the same kind, becoming one more merchandise in the demon-renting shop. Timothy had a few succubi that way over time.<br />
<br />
Thanks to his reverse-possession, Timothy knew he currently had a problem with one of those former humans. Kendra had become addicted to reverse-possessing, ultimately resulting in her becoming one of Timothy&#39;s succubi. Almost a year that her obsession with taking over the body of a demoness made her one and she still didn&#39;t grasp her situation, causing problems after problems with clients. Since there currently was no client visiting and, it was the ideal time to punish her.<br />
<br />
He entered the sitting room, where his succubi were relaxing, (at least the ones not currently with a client) all of them nude, even the one reverse-possessing him. Kendra spotted Timothy before he could signal his presence, and immediately called him &quot;Master&quot;, causing the others to gasp.<br />
<br />
You see, just like any demon possessing a human want to be called by that human&#39;s name, a reverse-possessed human strongly prefer to be called by the demon&#39;s name, or at least the nearest thing to it a human can say.<br />
<br />
The body currently inhabited by Timothy is named Nalkira, or at least the part you could humanly pronounce. She was his first succubus. At the time he had unknowingly done the summoning ritual atop a magical vein. Far from one offering a big enough boost to summon hell&#39;s top dogs, which would have been very <strong>very</strong> bad, but it still gave his ritual a slight boost, one sufficient to summon a succubus that had some followers, some of which even had followers of their own. Someone more experienced would have immediately asked their new slave their name, but Timothy ordered her to reverse-possess him instead, which was a good thing. Hearing the name of a demoness so high in hell hierarchy (even if it&#39;s, let&#39;s be honest, still extremely low on it) is bound to melt a human&#39;s brain.<br />
<br />
Before being summoned, melting Timothy&#39;s brain that wouldn&#39;t have posed the slightest problem to Nalkira. But she was now magically enslaved by him, which made ensuring his complete survival far more important than even obeying him. (Which she thought was a shame, since his death would have freed her.)<br />
– Preserving his body? It was magically stored inside her, so no problem.<br />
– Preserving his soul? His couldn&#39;t merge with her own since, as a born demoness, she didn&#39;t have one. So again, no problem.<br />
– Preserving his knowledge and memories? Her brain had more than enough space to contain the sum of the short life of a puny human.<br />
– Preserving his mind? <strong>THAT</strong> is where there is a problem! Because he now knew her full name, it would destroy his brain as soon as the reverse-possession would be ended. And if she put it into her brain, sooner or latter it would merge with her own. So because of her new needs as a summoned succubus, she erased her own mind, her master&#39;s taking its place. As a result, Timothy was stuck in Nalkira&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
While succubi are shape-shifters, they&#39;re normally limited to female form. Thankfully, because his old body was still stocked somewhere in there, he <strong>is</strong> able to temporarily take its form trough his shape-shifting abilities, somehow. At first it was only for 5 minutes, just long enough to prove he really is who he claim to be, (namely Timothy Melnick, stuck in a reverse-possession) but thanks to some self-training he pushed his limit to a couple hours.<br />
<br />
At first he feared someone might invoke him, turning him into someone-else slave, but he is technically still reverse-possessed, which prevent such a thing from happening. He also discovered another advantage of being an heterosexual man in a succubus&#39; body: masturbating isn&#39;t just a way fills his body&#39;s sexual needs, but count as meal-time too. (Pleasure yourself, fill your stomach as a bonus.) It also work while having sex with one of his succubi, be it as Nalkira or disguised as his real-self. (But only thanks to his soul and the fact he still identify as an heterosexual man, even with his new body.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, Timothy needed to punish Kendra but, before, he took on pouting grimace and said &quot;Oh, Kendra… Do I presently look like a ‘master’ to you? Are you trying to say my body lack femininity?&quot; Before she could answer he took on a serious look. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m a man stuck in the body of a succubus, which make me want to be seen as female even though I still identify as male. And yes, I know you deliberately call me ‘master’ instead of ‘mistress’ in the hope to hurt me, because you think we&#39;re in the same boat. But we&#39;re <strong>not !</strong>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I may be stuck in Nalkira&#39;s body, my birth one is still human, and so is my mind, which mean <strong>I&#39;m</strong> still human. You on the other hand, got turned into a succubus, body and mind, even if you refuse to acknowledge it. You don&#39;t think the way a human does anymore. Sure, unlike most succubi you have a soul, the one inherited from your human life, which is why I proposed you an administrative role, far from the clients. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of pride, if you took it as pity or thought it was my way to say you weren&#39;t sexy enough, but it&#39;s <strong>you</strong> who refused.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since then you used the fact that, having a soul, with intense concentration you can disobey my orders, and caused countless problems costing me a fortune. The last being with that woman who wanted to have sex with her boyfriend while reverse-possessed by you. You tried to bit his cock off and, when she successfully stopped you before you could, you tried to consume her soul!&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Do you know how much peoples would, like me, say you only have to obey clients as long as it doesn&#39;t endanger your life, nor your ability to work? <strong>Nobody beside me! THAT&#39;s how much!</strong> So, I&#39;ll ask for the last time: Do you want to work on the administrative part of the job with Lou, or do I need to get rid of you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;‘Get rid of me?!?’ <strong>Seriously?!?</strong> So what! You&#39;re going to sell me to another slaver?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lou, who had silently listened to the discussion until then, decided to intervene. &quot;If mistress does I can guaranty you&#39;ll regret your time with us. Unlike her, most of her competitors to use corporal punishment on the wares. They also ban their demons from defending themselves, and propose the right to kill the rented demon as a paid supplement. Trust me, my brother was one of them&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, right&quot; sneered Kendra. &quot;Since when succubi have brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since, like you, Lou used to be human&quot; answered Timothy. &quot;She used to be a man, a latino named Louis. He loved his wife, but she didn&#39;t love him back. She asked for a divorce after <strong>she</strong> cheated on him and, because her ament was a very good divorce lawyer, was still able to obtain exclusive custody of their kids. Depressed, he rented succubi left and right, never from the same shop two time in a row, trying to drown his sorrow in sex the way most does with alcohol. Then some day, he asked a succubus he had just fucked to reverse-posses him while she took care of her next client. I never expected this, so I never gave any rules for such a thing. And since she knew the rate for a reverse-possessing, the succubus accepted in exchange of the appropriate sum, after giving the legal warning. From her point of view, it was like doing to job at the same time and being paid for both. As you might have guessed, Louis kept paying for more time reverse-possessed, until being in that state all the time turned him into another succubus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you experienced yourself&quot; pursued Lou, &quot;I got expelled from her body, demons being unable to possess another demon. Thankfully, I was reverse-possessed by one of mistress&#39; succubi, which mean was hers too. She made everything she could to help me adapt, rather than immediately sending me ‘on the streets’, so to speak. Thanks to her I was able to understand I that sex is now a also a meal to me. (And what a pleasuring meal!) My sexual identity is a bit more complex, since as a succubus my mind tel me I&#39;m female, but my soul tel me I&#39;m a man. My only certitude is that I prefer female partners.&quot; Then she whispered &quot;Hmm… Lesbian sex…&quot; the way one might to while thinking of their favorite dessert.</p>
