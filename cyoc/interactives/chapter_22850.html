<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Jeremy ran to the beach and looked down at his body. His clothes felt constricting. A part of him just wanted to throw all of them off and embrace the clothing optional rule of the beach.</p>

<p>In fact, he realised that he wasn’t afraid of the idea of people seeing his body at all. Normally, he’d be far too embarrassed to take his shirt off in public but now, now that he felt he was letting his true self out, he didn't care what other people thought.</p>

<p>He slipped off his shirt and threw it onto the ground. He noticed his chest for the first time. It took the lad a good several seconds to accept that what he was looking at really was his chest. His muscles were well developed and he had quite a bit of hair on it. It didn’t look at all like he thought it would look. This hair wasn’t curly, but finer. No matter, Jeremy thought, hair was hair.</p>

<p>Next, he removed his shoes and socks and again, threw them to the side. He noticed that his toenails had turned black. That made little sense but again, Jeremy just didn’t seem to care. He walked onto the hot sand and listened for the same giggles that had beckoned him before.</p>

<p>Jeremy heard the sound of running water, as though someone were taking a shower. Jeremy walked in the direction, only to notice the sound was a good distance away. He’d never had hearing like this and was starting to wonder just what was happening.</p>

<p>“Awww, they went into the shower; now we’ll never get to see them!” came a voice. It was the voice of the same guy that Jeremy had heard saying this beach was clothing optional.</p>

<p>Jeremy watched the guy and his friend, (Trevor Jeremy remembered the guy’s name was) walk towards the woman’s change room.</p>

<p>“I wish we could go in there without getting caught,” the guy said.</p>

<p>“Yeah, me too,” Trevor said.</p>

<p>A breeze blew over the beach. Jeremy watched with a sort of fascination as something seemingly impossible happened. The bodies of both young men reformed right before Jeremy’s eyes. Their leg hair all fell out and their head hair grew longer until it reached their shoulders. Their legs reformed into a shapelier form.</p>

<p>“They’re turning into girls!” Jeremy said to himself.</p>

<p>What he was witnessing was impossible, yet it still amused them. He knew he should have panicked or ran, but what was seeing was far too funny for that.</p>

<p>“Hey, what’s happening to us!” the guy asked.</p>

<p>Jeremy watched as their shirts tented, with what he could only guess was a pair of breasts developing on their chests. Their facial features softened and soon, two young women stood there. The first one, Jeremy still didn’t know his, no her (Jeremy laughed aloud at that) name was the first to talk.</p>

<p>“W…what happened to us?”</p>

<p>He didn’t want either of the new ladies to catch him, so Jeremy hid behind a shack and stood on his knees. As he laughed, his feet felt strange. The scene before Jeremy transfixed him enough that he didn't care what his feet were doing.</p>

<p>“We’re g…girls!” Trevor said. She watched her formally male friend looking her up and down. “W…what are you looking at?”</p>

<p>The young lady pointed at Trevor’s chest and laughed. “You have boobs! Take off oyur shirt, I wana see em.”</p>

“So do you Jack! Take off your own shirt,” Trevor said.

<p>“About time someone said her name!” Jeremy said. Now his feet felt totally different. He was too busy watching Trevor and Jack to care.</p>

<p>“Hey, I just thought of something; now we can go into the girls shower room!” Jack said.</p>

<p>“Dude, you’re crazy! We just turned into girls! Shouldn’t we get help or something?” Trevor asked.</p>

<p>Jeremy fell onto his back and started laughing aloud. This was too hilarious to be true. As he lay back on the ground laughing, Jeremy’s entire body felt strange. His skin became itchy and warm and he felt even stronger. He heard a ripping sound and looked up to see his shorts tearing. What else, he saw however, truly terrified him.</p>

<p>His feet were gone, at the end of his legs were hooves! Brown hair had covered his legs to the point that he couldn’t even see his skin under it. Worse, his entire body seemed to be growing and his legs were moving to the sides of his torso.</p>

<p>“W…what’s happening?” Jeremy cried.</p>

<p>His hands started stinging and he brought them up to his face. He noticed that his arms were like his legs; covered in so much hair that he couldn’t see his skin. His fingernails were turning black and starting to cover his fingers!</p>

<p>“N…no!” Jeremy yelled.</p>

<p>Jeremy felt something swishing in the sand and looked between his legs. For the first time, he saw his tail. It was long and had a tassel at the end of it.</p>

<p>Fearing the worst, Jeremy felt the sides of his head. He gasped when he found that his ears were long and furred.</p>

<p>“Need to find a mirror!” Jeremy yipped.</p>

<p>He tried to get up, only to fall onto all fours. His arms, which were growing longer, kept him from falling on his face. Jeremy tried to stand again and heard his shorts rip and felt them fall off his body. Unfortunately, gravity again seemed determined for him to walk on four legs and he fell onto his hands.</p>

<p>“No, they’re not even hands anymore!” Jeremy cried.</p>

<p>His fingernails had turned a solid black and had all but grown over his fingers. Jeremy looked back to see his tail swishing between his legs. He saw hooves were his feet should have been. His underwear was straining against his expanding hips as his legs had almost completed their change into back legs.</p>

<p>The fun had vanished. Now, Jeremy knew why his parents warned him about this place. He tried his best to walk. It worked although much to his embarrassment and fear, he was walking on what would soon four legs with hooves at the end of them.</p>

<p>“This can’t he hawwwpening,” Jeremy said.</p>

<p>Tears poured from darkening eyes when he realised the sound he’d made. It had come from deep in his throat. It wasn’t a word; it was an animal sound.</p>

<p>He tried his best to walk and ignore his situation but he couldn’t help it.</p>

<p><i>No, now I’ll never be able to play video games again!</i></p>

<p>He found a door into the shack and managed to push it open. He ran into what he discovered was a change room. There was no one in it, something he was thankful for. Jeremy ran right to a mirror when he saw one. Again, he felt tears forming when he saw his refection.</p>

<p>His face was covered in the fur, the colour and pattern of which, combined with his long ears couldn’t have been anything but that of a donkey. His face was still human in shape but a sudden sharp pain in it showed him that it soon wouldn’t be.</p>

<p><i>I don’t want to be a donkey. I came here to have fun! Why didn’t I listen to my parents when they told me to stay away from here?</i></p>

<p>Jeremy was too shocked to do anything but watch as his face pushed out. His belly began expanding and Jeremy felt the rush of air into his lungs as they developed into donkey lungs. His tail was now lashing back and forth; he couldn’t control it. He heard a cracking of bones and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>He heard his underwear rip and felt them fall off, leaving without any clothing at all.</p>

<p><i>Nooooooo nooooooo, this can’t be happening. I just wanted to have fun. I just wanted to be my true self without people telling me what to do. I don't want to be a naked donkey. I'm a boy ... not a donkey Where are Zach and Michael? Why arn't then helping me?</i></p>

<p>Jeremy tried to speak but his voice betrayed him. In place of his human voice, a deep and loud bray flew out from his muzzle. He opened his eyes as the sensation of his belly and face changing subsided. His vision was different and Jeremy soon saw why; he had a donkey head complete with donkey eyes. The mirror showed the refection of a donkey. Jeremy knew it, laughing at those two guys as they had become girls had been the final trigger.</p>

<p><i>That feeling as I came here; no, it must have been my tail!</i></p>

<p>The body part in question swished back and forth and Jeremy started braying uncontrollably. He was too scared and couldn’t stop thinking about what could happen to him.</p>

<p><i>Someone help me. Please someone help me!</i></p>

<p>“Shhhh, it’s okay, we’ll help you!” came a voice, it was a young woman’s voice.</p>

<p>Jeremy stopped braying and did his best to concentrate on the voice. He could smell and hear two humans enter the shack. His eyes went wide and he brayed when he saw that it was Jack and Trevor.</p>

<p>“Calm down,” Trevor said, petting Jeremy’s back.</p>

<p>“Look dude, we heard you laughing at us when this happened to us,” Trevor said.</p>

<p>Jeremy brayed and hung his head; he knew that said action had triggered this happening to him. He was so afraid that he wasn’t sure he could control himself. He needed to escape; it was starting to become the only thing he could think of.</p>

<p>“We also saw this happen to you after. That was mean of you to laugh at us but you didn’t deserve this!” Jack said.</p>

<p>“This place is seriously screwed up; we have to get out of here. Maybe then we’ll change back,” Trevor said.</p>

<p>“I dunno Trev, you look kinda cute as a girl,” Jack said.</p>

<p>“This isn’t funny. You saw what happened to this guy. If we laugh at each other, we might turn into donkeys. Then we’ll be female donkeys around a male!” Trevor said.</p>

<p>“Ewww,” Jack said.</p>

<p>“Did you come here with anyone?” Trevor asked.</p>

<p>Jeremy brayed and nodded his head before stamping his front left hoof twice.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s find your friends and get the heck out of here!” Trevor said.</p>

<p>“I still think you look better this way!” Jack said.</p>

<p>“If you wana stay a girl then be my guest and stay here,” Trevor said.</p>

<p>“Okay, okay, I’m going,” Jack said.</p>

<p>Trevor petted Jeremy down his back. “Don’t worry man, we’re getting out of here. Just no laughing at us anymore okay?”</p>

<p>Jeremy nodded.</p></p>
