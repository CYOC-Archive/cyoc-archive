<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the meeting began to break off from Tad&#39;s official welcome to the night&#39;s specific activities, Nate and Alex did their best to make their official announcement, particularly to some of Alex&#39;s other friends in the pack. Some were older than them, about the same age as Tad, though much of their &quot;hello&quot; to him ended up being being a brief wave as a white furred female werewolf took him off fairly quickly. Nate felt a little disheartened by how fast things had progressed with the meeting, as he&#39;d hoped that there would have been time for some real introductions to Tad, to satisfy his curiosity on the new werewolf as well as the opportunity for him and Alex to make things official.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that plan went down quickly,&quot; Nate sighed as the back began to break up into pairs and head off into the woods. Some were even transforming as they went.<br />
<br />
&quot;What plan?&quot; came a voice to the side.<br />
<br />
Both Nate and Alex turned to see Austin and Christina Perry standing quietly beside them. There was a bit of concern, which Nate felt was understandable. They were the pack&#39;s Alphas, after all, and Ben had said everyone was pretty well aware that Nate and Alex were a couple. So, if that was the case here, they might be puzzled as to what announcement Nate and Alex had. Alex knew that sometimes werewolves left their packs, either because they had to leave Moon Lake for some reason or because they&#39;d met or married someone from a different pack and decided to join that one. That sort of thing was normal, though, Alex figured that Austin and Christina might be a bit annoyed if they thought that Nate and Alex were leaving, since Nate had only just joined the previous Saturday.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we&#39;d kinda hoped there would be some time for us to announce something,&quot; Nate said weakly, scratching the back of his head as he did so, &quot;that... well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We wanted to say that we were an official couple,&quot; Alex commented, &quot;we... we really hit it off at Nate&#39;s ceremony and soon after...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Christina gave a smile, &quot;well... that is good for the both of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things going well for you two?&quot; Austin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Going well,&quot; Nate said with a smile and held Alex to him, &quot;aside from my dad&#39;s official welcome to the Skulk tomorrow, Alex and I have some plans for fun and maybe even adventure for the weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of adventure?&quot; came another new voice that startled all of them.<br />
<br />
Nate and Alex both turned to see a pair of young girls in a pair of shorts and a tee-shirt. One had a decal of Disney&#39;s princesses while the other had the decal of a wolf in a nature scene. Both Nate and Alex were surprised by the appearance, though it wasn&#39;t very late, yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally... Jess... were coming back,&quot; Christina said quickly and came between Nate and Alex and picked up the first girl, the one in the Disney princess tee-shirt, and picked her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our movie ended and you hadn&#39;t come back,&quot; the girl, Sally, commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;We just had a little business to attend to, dears,&quot; Austin commented, &quot;welcoming a new member.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he him?&quot; the second girl asked, pointing to Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I joined this past Saturday,&quot; Nate answered, figuring these two were the owners of the Disney movies that he had seen when he first met Austin, &quot;I take it you two are the heads of the Perry household.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls giggled at the complement.<br />
<br />
&quot;They like to THINK they are,&quot; Austin said with a chuckle, &quot;these are Sally and Jessica. They were asleep when you had your ceremony, Nate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And were supposed to be inside,&quot; Christina spoke, &quot;I don&#39;t want my babies catching cold...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally only responded by snuggling into her mother&#39;s arms. Jessica, or Jess for short, only looked up to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our movie ended,&quot; Jess stated, &quot;and you weren&#39;t back yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Austin smiled to them. He had a great deal of pride in AJ, who was shaping up to be a good Beta, and that gave him confidence that the Pack would be in good hands should anything happen to him and Christina, but there was something about Sally and Jess that was just adorable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... our part in the meeting is over,&quot; Austin said to them, &quot;why don&#39;t we go inside and we can watch another one together. Does that sound fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay!&quot; Sally and Jess cheered together, which made both Austin and Christina smile.<br />
<br />
As the Perrys prepared to go inside, Austin turned back to Nate and Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry your little announcement plan didn&#39;t go as you&#39;d hoped,&quot; Austin said to them, &quot;but you both made a good couple. Hopefully things go well and you have a good weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate and Alex both nodded as Austin and Christina began to walk their younger children inside. Sally and Jess didn&#39;t get an answer as to their question as to what Nate and Alex&#39;s plans were, but given that much of their other plans for the night included some hot and heavy male on male action, they figured that was probably a good idea that the young pups, didn&#39;t know. From what Nate could see, he guessed that Sally and Jess were between four and six years old, not an age in which one knew all the ins and outs of sex. They did wave to Nate and Alex as they went in with their parents. Nate waved back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those two are adorable,&quot; Nate commented as he and Alex turned back and began to head into the woods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Alex agreed, &quot;Austin and Christina&#39;s youngest... obviously too young to have had their first transformation, but among the most precious members of the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Moon Lake seems to have a lot of happy families,&quot; Nate commented, &quot;Your parents with you... The Perrys with AJ, Sally, and Jess... The Twists with Ben...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents with you and your brother,&quot; Alex added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Nate shrugged, &quot;Mom and dad had some issues... but since they both became weres, those issues are quickly disappearing the rear-view mirror as it were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate didn&#39;t say it, but if things worked out in the long run, he hoped that he and Alex could have their own happy family in the future.</p>
