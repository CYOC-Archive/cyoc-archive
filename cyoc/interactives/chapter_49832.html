<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jensen observed quietly from an upper floor window of the backyard as Kaylee gave her instructions to the newly gathered wolves. All in all, he thought things had gone fairly well. The anime fur coloring was somewhat odd and clearly had Kaylee's paws all over it, but he wasn't about to complain. As he observed, he began to notice something.<br />
<br />
Darla had initially reported that they only had one &quot;token&quot; male out of the whole group, but the whole group numbered close to twenty. As Bart had said earlier, with that many females, even with the subordinate male,  he would have to spend his entire day servicing them all, and Kaylee would require double his attention... not to mention that he had other things he needed to do.<br />
<br />
He then seriously hoped that Kaylee, Fran, and Darla had mistaken the number of females they had added to the Pack.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Kaylee enjoyed wearing the helmet. She didn't know if it played into past pretend games when she had been Kyle, but she liked the idea of playing drill Sargent. As the gathered group of wolves began to form a single file line to head up a small desk Fran and Darla had set up to hand out the assignments for remaking the estate. <br />
<br />
They had a hat in which they had the chores assigned to remake the manor, with much of it having been prepared by the shadows, and next to it, they had a legal pad which had a list of names on it. It read:<br />
&quot;Jensen, Big Bad Wolf.<br />
Kaylee, Alpha Female.<br />
Fran, Beta<br />
Darla, Beta<br />
Bart, son of Jensen and Kaylee.<br />
Jenny, daughter of Jensen and Kaylee.<br />
Kevin, son of Jensen and Kaylee.<br />
Marcy, daughter of Jensen and Kaylee.<br />
Alice, daughter of Jensen, mother unknown...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not certain which one of you two is Alice's mother?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither of us have had much time to talk with her, they way you've had with Bart, Kevin, Marcy, and Jenny,&quot; Fran answered, &quot;and since none of us have had the pleasure of conceiving children, yet, it is not like we can do all of this from memory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The list is just to keep track of the Pack's members,&quot; Darla added, &quot;Make sure no one is forgotten.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee then nodded and then spoke the wolves in line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, step forward and receive your tasks,&quot; Kaylee spoke in her best Sargent voice, &quot;be sure to state your current name.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first to step up was a pink she-wolf with B cup breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maxine,&quot; the she wolf spoke and took a slip of paper from the hat.<br />
<br />
Maxine then headed toward the manor. The next in line was pastel green wolf that at first glance looked rather girlish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roger,&quot; the wolf spoke in a voice that was masculine, but not very deep, making Kaylee and the twins pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said your CURRENT name,&quot; Kaylee growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is my current name,&quot; Roger argued, and then looked down embarrassed, &quot;it's not my fault I'm not as muscular as the master or as well endowed as Nick.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then looked forward to notice the male sheath was there, and easily seen.<br />
<br />
Kaylee then turned to Darla, &quot;How could you have missed this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was outside the room when they transformed,&quot; Darla gave a submissive whimper to Kaylee, &quot;and we all had to come out here as soon as they were all changed. I never got a good chance to get a good look at all of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got a good look at Nick, Sister,&quot; Fran taunted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but he is nearly as big as the master, down there,&quot; Darla answered.<br />
<br />
Kaylee and Fran both daydreamed back to the night before for a moment. After shaking her head, Kaylee finally got things back on track.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Roger, take your task and get to work,&quot; Kaylee spoke, &quot;I also expect you to put on some muscle by the end of the month. The females you may get to mate with won't like it if their mate is a lightweight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Alpha Female,&quot; Roger answered and took his slip of paper.<br />
<br />
He was followed by a female with blue fur, which actually had two tones to it. The sides of her muzzle, her C cup breasts, her stomach, and her inner thighs were a sky blue while the rest was a plain blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashley,&quot; the female spoke and took her slip of paper.<br />
<br />
Ashley was followed by a female with magenta fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Robyn,&quot; the magenta she-wolf spoke and took her slip.<br />
<br />
Robyn was followed by a female with fur the same color as Roger's.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan,&quot; she spoke, &quot;Roger is my brother... so I hope you don't want him to mate with me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be no incestuous relationships,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;we may be big and bad, but we aren't complete monsters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran and Darla giggled, knowing full well that if the people of Glendale actually knew everything, they likely would be considered monsters. But, the pack was still hidden, and likely would remain so.<br />
<br />
The next to step up was again male, but he looked rather young. He wasn't a puppy the way Jenny, Bart, Marcy, Kevin, and Alice were, but neither did he look entirely mature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ulysses,&quot; he spoke and took his slip, and nervously moved away.<br />
<br />
Next came a she-wolf who had sort of pearl colored fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pearl,&quot; she spoke, taking a slip of paper. Fran and Darla didn't notice the irony in her name as they wrote it down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah,&quot; said a lavender she-wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra,&quot; a gray furred she wolf spoke, and took her slip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beatrice,&quot; said plain green she-wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lawrence,&quot; said a white furred male wolf, meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have the same orders as Roger does, in addition to the work of renovating the manor,&quot; Kaylee spoke bluntly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Alpha Female,&quot; Lawrence bowed his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Ulysses?&quot; Fran asked, &quot;You didn't give him those orders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's only a boy,&quot; Kaylee dismissed it, &quot;Maybe the two who did get those orders will encourage him to get in shape for his potential she-wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Caroline,&quot; said a female covered in dark blue fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anne,&quot; said a cream furred female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Margot,&quot; said a red-violet female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jasmine,&quot; said a sea green female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Terri,&quot; said a blue green she-wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sandi,&quot; said a teal she-wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;June,&quot; said a silver/gray mixed she-wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nicole,&quot; said a gray furred female, with a small piece of red ribbon tied around one ear since her human hair had fallen out.<br />
<br />
The female was about to move away when the one that they had all clearly seen as male came up and began to message Nicole's posterior. The she-wolf seemed to enjoy the attention, but quickly caught herself with Kaylee, Fran, and Darla watching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now, Nick, we have work to do,&quot; Nicole spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick,&quot; the male spoke with a sigh and took his own assignment.<br />
<br />
And with that, they all began to go inside. Darla only paused to add Martha's name to the end of the list, along with the rank the master had given her. Fran, Kaylee, and Darla then brought up the rear of the formation, as they would mostly be supervising the work being done.<br />
<br />
As the sounds of the work started inside the manor, the pups, meanwhile looked about the lawn and the large area they had to play in.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what shall we do?&quot; Alice asked after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kevin and I are going to go see if we can find any rabbits,&quot; Bart announced as he stood up, &quot;they've been known to come onto the estate from time to time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do if we find any?&quot; Kevin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chase them, of course,&quot; Bart answered, knowing this would be part of his plan to get Kevin to side with him in any future disagreement between him and his sisters, &quot;who knows... maybe we'll catch one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Kevin nodded and moved to stand by Bart.<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as you stay in the back yard,&quot; Martha reminded the two male pups as they began to move off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like to look at my flowers,&quot; Jenny spoke as she stood up, &quot;see what will need to be replanted or moved or fertilized.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help?&quot; Marcy asked.<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded, and then turned her head to Alice.<br />
<br />
Alice, meanwhile had turned her head to follow Fran and Darla as they went inside. After a moment she turned back to Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I can tag along,&quot; Alice sighed, &quot;though glass doesn't smell anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot; Jenny cheered and began to lead the three female pups toward the garden around the back end of the manor.<br />
<br />
Martha, meanwhile, kept one head on the females and another on the males as the day went along.</p>
