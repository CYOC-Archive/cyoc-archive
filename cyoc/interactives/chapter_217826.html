<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For being only 9 years old Jessica Thomas had to grow up very fast.<br />
<br />
She had only met her “father” three of four times in her entire life and personally she wished she never had. <br />
<br />
He was a stuck up man and self-centered but that wasn’t his worse quality, his worse quality was that he was a greedy coward. <br />
<br />
He had admitted to her even before DNA test had confirmed it for the courts that she was his which was bad enough considering his rich parents her grandparents were calling her mother a whore attempting to baby trap their son. It only got worse when he admitted that he had arranged to get married to his wife long before he met her mother, he just wanted a plaything for a while. <br />
<br />
His parents had done their best to destroy her mother and herself, making them look horrible in the press and using all the connections that come from generational wealth to make sure they had to pay almost nothing in child support while owning a multi billion-dollar company.<br />
<br />
And if anything, they were the better people compared to her stepmother and her parents, they where just as rich possible more so any they had made it their mission to destroy them.<br />
<br />
Her mother, one of the smartest women Jessica had ever seen had been spat on before her very eyes while they rode the subway because of the stories put out by them. She had lost multiple jobs, starting with a company she had worked for almost 4 years which had refused to fire her had been bought out by them just to fire her. <br />
<br />
She knew that while her father “family” had always refused to admit it she knew one of the main reasons her and her mother were attacked so hard was based on race. Her mother was Mexican American while her father’s side of her family was snow white. She was mixed race but took more after her mother, they had been called so many slurs, her mother accused of being an illegal alien even though her great great grandfather had fought for the Union in the American Civil war, unlike her great grandfather on her father’s side who had been a slave owning officer in the South. She was more American than they were yet she and her mother where being painted as the bad guys. <br />
<br />
Whenever she had moved to a new school, someone would find out about her family. It wasn’t hard an internet search of her name would pull it up as headline news and then the bullying would begin again. She would always loss every friend she had and school would become hell until she was forced to move again. The record for how long it took someone to figure out about her family was 4 months, the shortest was 4 hours.<br />
<br />
Jessica hated them all and, in some ways, hated humanity for how they just blindly followed people like her father, grandparents and her stepmother/her parents. That is why she had “pushed” her mother to come here and apply.<br />
<br />
Becoming a magical creature working in one of their parks would solve so many of their issues.<br />
 <br />
“Jessica.” Said her mother as she came out of the interview room. <br />
<br />
“Will you come here.” Asked Mavis as Jessica came into the room to see the interviewer sitting there. “Now, dear I have decided to take the job opportunity and become a mythical creature, but I want you to join me.” <br />
<br />
“Of course.” Confirmed Jessica trying and failing to hide her happiness at the news. “So what are we becoming?”<br />
<br />
“I am going to let you decide there are some things that we can’t become but the choice is yours.” Said her mother as the interviewer pushed across a computer tablet with a list of possible mythical creatures they could become. </p>

What does Jessica choose?</h3>
