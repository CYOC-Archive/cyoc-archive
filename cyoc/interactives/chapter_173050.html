<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You back up, feeling kinda freaked out.  You’d acted purely on instinct, and somehow turned the woman that had followed you in here into the strange living stuffed animal.  This must have been what that weird note had been talking about.  What kinda place was this?<br />
<br />
As you stand there freaking out, the little cat doll continues to stare at you, eagerly awaiting your orders.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what happened to you?”  You stammer.<br />
<br />
“You transformed me and made me yours, Master.  I thank you for it, it’s so freeing not to need to worry about eating or sleeping or any other messy, fleshy stuff like that.  And I like my new look, too.”<br />
<br />
Looking her over,.you had to admit, you did find it cute.  You’d had a bit of a maid and a shortstack fetish, and did kinda like furries, even if you wouldn’t be nearly so eager to admit that to any potential lover, so all those things being changes you made purely on instinct made sense.  The diapers, though?  You don’t really remember being into that.  The note said the “foundation” of their new forms would be set by the house, so maybe that was part of it?  But it also said you wouldn’t have found this place if that “foundation” wasn’t appealing to you…  Was this some kinda hidden subconscious desire that even you didn’t know about, or something?  <br />
<br />
“Is there anything more you’d like to ask me, Master?”  The doll asks, interrupting your wandering thoughts.  “Or a command to give me?  Or perhaps you want to give me a name?”  She sounded as if she was waiting on you.<br />
<br />
“Right, your name, what’s your name?”<br />
<br />
“That is for you to decide, Master.”<br />
<br />
You cock your eyebrow.  “You don’t remember your name?”<br />
<br />
“I remember that before this wonderful new life you gave me, I was named Jennifer Mary Hathaway.  But Master has the right to call me whatever he wants, and that is what I will be called.”<br />
<br />
“...Right.”  You mumble.  “We’ll just stick with your old name for now, then.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Master!”  Jennifer said cheerfully.  “How may I serve you, now?”<br />
<br />
“Er, do you know anything about how this magic works?  About how I’m ‘the master and hostage’ of this mansion?”<br />
<br />
“It’s a good thing knowing how this spell works is part of the mental foundation of our changes.”  Jennifer stood up straight, closed her eyes, and recited, “Master has become the master of this mansion in that all that willingly cross the property line will have their bodies and minds become Master’s to mold into living doll maids, based on any animal Master can imagine.  Any-”<br />
<br />
“Is the diaper thing mandatory?”  You interrupt.<br />
<br />
“Yes Master.” Jennifer nodded without a hint of embarrassment.  “It is purely for your aesthetic enjoyment, just like the dresses and the animal features.”<br />
<br />
“That’s… nice?”  You really aren’t sure how to feel about that.<br />
<br />
“We dolls don’t need to eat, or remove waste, so they will never need to be changed.”  She paused.  “Would Master like for me to continue with the original explanation of the magic in this place?”<br />
<br />
“Er, yeah, go ahead.”<br />
<br />
She continued her recitation.  “Anyone brought over the property line unwillingly, whether by your maids, or by others, Master will be unable to change, unless they leave, then willingly re-enter.  Master him-or-herself, however will feel an overriding instinctual desire to avoid getting too close to the property line, and cannot be made to cross it willingly.  Should Master be forced over the property line, then the magic linking them to the mansion will be severed, and all organs will fail simultaneously.”  <br />
<br />
She frowned.  “And that would be simply too awful to think about!”<br />
<br />
“Wh-what?”  You stammer.  You weren’t quite sure how, but you KNEW, without a doubt, that what she’d told you was true.  “What on earth am I supposed to do if I can’t leave the house!  I can’t go to work!  I can’t see my family or friends! I can’t go shopping…  I can’t even go and move in my stuff from my home.  Is this place even getting water and electricity?”<br />
<br />
“A quick phone call will be able to fix the last two problems, Master.  As for the rest, that is what we maids are here for!  We will provide for you and bring you whatever you need from the outside world!”<br />
<br />
“And how do you plan to go out and buy me anything looking like that?  At best, people will think you’re a kid in a costume!”<br />
<br />
She looked down.  “... We’ll find a way!  For you, Master!”<br />
<br />
You shook your head.  That clinches it, you were doomed.  “Look, how about you just clean up around here so we don’t kick up dust clouds big enough to choke me every time one of us moves, okay?”<br />
<br />
“Absolutely, Master!”  Jennifer cheered, leaving huge clouds of dust as she moved to another room to grab a broom.<br />
<br />
You plopped down on the couch, coughing as you made another dust cloud.  Once you’d cleared your throat, you pull out your cell phone.  While you hadn’t considered it during the initial panic, but back during the big 2020 pandemic lockdown, you’d found a lot of good online shopping and delivery services.  Granted, actually being able to afford living off that alone would be a huge problem, but at least you won’t starve tonight.  You open a diner delivery app, and place an order.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
After about twenty minutes, you look through the window and see a car pulling up to the rusty gate surrounding the mansion.  The young, bleary-eyed delivery guy gets out of his beat-up old car, holding a bag from the local <I>Crazy Chicken</I>,  and made his way to the front door.<br />
<br />
As he gets closer, you try to reach out for him with the power of the house, like the last time.<br />
<br />
He begins to shrink white fur with dozens of black stripes growing all over his body while his skin turns to fabric, and his innards are reduced to cotton.  His body mass spreads out more the further he shrinks, giving him a somewhat chubby look.  His chest swells up while his hips widened giving her a womanly appearance, while his shirt and jeans weave together, turning black as they become a dress with a white apron and, (though you consciously tried not to add it this time) a diaper.  Her shoes fall off as her feet shrink back and turn into round, black, plastic hooves.  A short tail, ending in a black tuft of fur, pokes through a newly-formed hole in the back of her dress.  Her hair became a black mohawk of a mane, while her eyes became flat white and brown plastic disks sewed onto her face.  Her nose and mouth pushed out quite some distance, giving her an equine snout.  <br />
<br />
The transformation finished, she steadied herself, and practically leapt to the door, a smile on her face.  <br />
<br />
Well, guess that confirms that coming here to do a job (when not doing so would get you fired) did count as “willingly” entering.<br />
<br />
You opened the door before she could ring the doorbell.<br />
<br />
“I brought you your meal, Master!”  She handed you the bag.  “Now you can name me, command me, and give me purpose.  I’ll serve and obey!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, uh… what was your old name?”<br />
<br />
“Timothy Franklin Rotherchild.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s go with Tina Francine Rotherchild then,” you mumble, not feeling particularly creative as you adjust to your imprisonment.<br />
<br />
As you get back to the couch, you bite into a chicken leg, and notice that Tina is still standing there.  She probably has more deliveries to make, right?  Then why is she… <br />
<br />
Oh, she’s under your orders, right.<br />
<br />
Should you even bother sending her back to her route in that state?  And now that you think about it, what are your two maids’ friends and family gonna think when they don’t show up at home tonight?  This is just a mess the whole way through.</p>
