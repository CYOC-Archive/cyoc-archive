<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julian and Diane Wyre glanced to each other with some pride as the Wood Street Den discussed the plans for Halloween. The ideas were pretty good and their new members, William and Martha Anderson had both come up with some very interesting ideas.  It was one of those things that many new Skulk members tended to be nervous over, as they weren&#39;t fully aware of how the Skulk&#39;s meetings ran and William Anderson likely had some additional strain with the fact that he had been inducted by a rogue vixen and might feel a bit nervous on that. But both of them came up with some interesting and good ideas that could make Halloween fun, which was a sign of adapting to things, which was good to Julian and Diane. The Skulk conducted a lot of its official business in a rather business like fashion and that could be something that made new members, but William and Martha Anderson appeared to be doing just fine.<br />
<br />
The fact that they came up with one idea that was rather new was also something Julian and Diane liked. New ideas did come up from time to time, but many times it became a sort of &quot;diamond in the rough&quot; that was hard to find, simply because there were so many different pranks and spooks that had already been pulled and could thus be boring when done over and over and there were others that didn&#39;t really work with weres. Heightened senses usually meant that hiding in the bushes to try and startle someone didn&#39;t always work. Weres would either hear or smell them coming. But switching things up would be too bad an idea for a prank and having members providing supervision would be helpful, particularly as most trick or treaters were young enough that they hadn&#39;t had their first transformations yet. Having fun was one thing, but the Skulk had long held that nothing should be malicious or should do harm to any one. That didn&#39;t give any fun to anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I think we have some good ideas,&quot; Julian said with a small smile on his muzzle, &quot;and especially good that new members had some good ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that is good,&quot; Diane said in agreement with her husband, which made both William and Martha smile.<br />
<br />
William liked it as it felt like acceptance. They actually welcomed him in in as a member and weren&#39;t just tolerating him because Yvette had clawed him, and he could feel that as both Douglas and Dawn patted him on the back and one of the others on the other side of Martha did the same with Martha. It was a very welcoming feeling, and as he looked over to Martha, he could see her smiling and guess that she had the same feelings. He carefully reached over and took her paw in his, relishing the silky feel of her fur.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, while William and Martha sat with their den and provided their advice tricks and treats to do for Halloween, Jenny and Harry sat quietly at the table for the Lycaon Drive Den. As with what William and Martha talked about regarding tricks and treats, the Lycaon Drive Den had many of the same results in many suggestions that were fairly typical Halloween pranks or celebration themed ideas with a sort of haunted house set up for actual Halloween related fun where spooks was okay. Eventually they came to Jenny on some things, and that made her shy away, even as her den presented its chosen ideas for a final vote. Though, there was no great pressure put on her or Harry, probably as since Dr. Tora Tachibana and his wife, Keiko, were her and Harry&#39;s den leaders, there was some understanding that their primary worries were on the wedding tomorrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father wouldn&#39;t let you have any fun like that?&quot; one older vixen looked to Jenny, looking very much like a worried grandmother with her red eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in any way that was quite like this,&quot; Jenny whispered while the list of options for ticks and treats were read on, &quot;I might get to go trick or treating as a little kid, but the costume was always simple and never anything more than that. He tried to keep me on a pretty tight leash, particularly as I got older. In a way... that&#39;s part of why picked Moon Lake College, as I&#39;d be far enough away that he couldn&#39;t just control me anymore... and in finding Harry.... I find the perfect reason live here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You two do look good together,&quot; the older vixen smiled, &quot;you&#39;ll have many centuries of happiness here. And WE&#39;RE all behind you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, you&#39;ve ALL been to kind,&quot; Jenny said softly to the vixen and pivoted one ear as she heard Akane from her table give the call for a vote on the proposed options.<br />
<br />
Jenny heard Akane list the best chosen options and then put them up option by option for a vote. Jenny voted for the haunted house idea and one that had the idea of reversing things. They were the best ideas that she liked. That covered things that related to Halloween and that the next item on the agenda would relate to the wedding.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The votes proceeded well with Akane calling on each den to vote on each successive idea. William felt welcomed and voted with the Wood Street den. As the votes finished he watched as Akane stood up at her personal den&#39;s table and looked out over the various other werefoxes that were there. There were also the occasional honorary members with the smaller weres, like Martha, in their fursonas with their werefox mates but with the larger ones is in their human forms so that they weren&#39;t naked at the Skulk&#39;s meeting. From there the meeting then moved on to the next big piece on the night&#39;s agenda.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thank you all for the ideas we&#39;ve voted on and they will hopefully provide plenty of fun for all in Moon Lake on Halloween,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;and as per normal, each den will be responsible for acting on the ideas we&#39;ve all voted for. But in the meantime, there is other business that will help ease our shame at the actions of Yvette Smith...&quot;<br />
<br />
William listened as a series low growls and barks were soon heard. The pitch wasn&#39;t quite as deep as what Nate could muster as a werewolf, just as foxes weren&#39;t as big as wolves, but it was distinctly canine.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is to give two new members who have forged an unbreakable bond the most happiness they can have,&quot; Akane spoke calmly as all eyes turned to look to Jenny and Harry. Both gave a small smile as all eyes turned to them. William only watched as Akane continued, &quot;And Harold Jenkins, Jennifer Harper... know that the Skulk will do its best to protect you and ensure you get the happiness you deserve in life. Or security and the police will make sure no harm comes to you. And we open the floor to those wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
From there, William watched as various married werefoxes gave their various well wishes to Harry and Jenny, though it was rather generic. Eventually William and Martha stood up together and looked to Jenny and Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny... Harry... while the exact nature of your courtship may be different, and some of it not in accordance with the college&#39;s policies on public display of affection, that doesn&#39;t mean that the love between you isn&#39;t real,&quot; William spoke, &quot;and from what I could see as your English Lit professor, that love was there and very real even before you were clawed. That bond forming as werefoxes, that only made it MORE real. It is something to cherish and love. That bond... it is amazing and can show you just how much you love each other and will give you happiness for years that you justly deserve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If if you ever have questions or concerns, such as who&#39;s side of the bed is who&#39;s or any questions on when to start your own family...&quot; Martha added, &quot;William and I would be more than willing to give you any and all help, advice, and even parental love should you need it or wish it. As I&#39;m sure everyone would wish to... especially after seeing how happy you are together... and that happiness... it MUST  be preserved.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few claps as William watched Jenny and Harry both mouth the words &quot;thank you.&quot;</p>
