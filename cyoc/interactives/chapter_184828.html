<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cabin was larger than it appeared on the outside. It had two floors, and already more than enough space on the first to hold a decent sized party; although, neither of the two men could ever imagine holding one a place like this. They both rarely found themselves away from the comfort of city enclosure, with most of their hobbies and jobs taking place indoors. Skyler worked out often and was quite fit, but tended to do it at a gym, with little exercise coming from exposure to the elements. He did, however, enjoy fishing, but it had been a couple years since he had found the time to plan any trips to enjoy that kind of leisurely activity. Even so, he had never been out for more than a day on the waters, so this would be his first time staying in a cabin like this. Rey&#39;s experiences were different, having gone on a few skiing trips as a child and staying in a lodge for several nights, but it was a different season, in a different place; and yet this cabin felt even more welcoming than a beacon of warmth tucked beneath the snow. He couldn’t place his finger on why, but it just felt so much nicer.<br />
<br />
They still weren’t entirely comfortable, as anything could still be lurking within the unlit rooms yet to be checked. They decided that Rey would search the bottom floor while Skyler searched the top. Skyler was both more muscular and taller than his friend, at about 6 foot 1 to Rey’s 5 foot 8. Despite being less brave than he would ever admit, he knew that if some crazy person was upstairs and needed to be wrestled, he would be more capable of throwing them down the stairs. <br />
<br />
Thus they began clearing each room, turning on every light they spotted. The cabin had everything one could need -- a kitchen, bathrooms, a living room, and so on. Most surprising was the number of bedrooms it had, with one master bedroom downstairs and several smaller ones upstairs. For a quaint cabin in the woods, it sure was loaded. <br />
<br />
The duo finished their exploration quickly, finding no signs of current inhabitants. Rather, everything was untouched, with beds being made, the fridge stocked with food, and not a single dusty surface in sight. Perhaps it was too welcoming.<br />
<br />
“Well damn, it’s a nice surprise all things considered. But we’re going to have to be extra careful to make sure we leave this place the way we found it. These people must be neat freaks.”  said Rey.<br />
<br />
“Relax, no one’s going to catch us. We’ll be here one night, and then off in the morning.”<br />
<br />
“Weren’t you terrified of breaking into this place just a little bit ago?”<br />
<br />
“I was worried about being shot!” Skyler responded, pausing a moment before deciding to drop the subject. “Whatever, I call the downstairs bedroom. 9:00 -- set it on your phone.”<br />
<br />
“Sure you don’t want to be upstairs with me? I know you’ll need saving if you have a nightmare.”<br />
<br />
“Goodnight.”<br />
<br />
Skyler shut the door crudely behind him. Rey chuckled to himself, always happy to tease his friend as friends often do, before heading upstairs and selecting one of the bedrooms to sleep in at random. He wasted no time, laying down, pulling up the covers, and drifting off almost immediately.<br />
<br />
Skyler wasn’t as ready to go to sleep. Something about sleeping in someone else’s bed uninvited where he couldn’t be caught was oddly invigorating. It wasn’t a thought that he ever would have considered crossing his mind, but ever since his girlfriend broke up with him about a month prior, he started exploring new ways to excite and pleasure himself. Even he had to admit this one was up there, however; but having been told outright to keep this place untouched and unharmed layered on top of the fact that he hadn’t even thought of a woman in a sexual tone in nearly a week made the idea much more appealing. Ultimately, he decided “fuck it”, double checked that the door was closed fully, and unzipped his pants, tossing them to the side.<br />
<br />
His cock was growing more erect by the moment, visibly pressed up against his undergarments. He was well hung, cock slightly bigger than average, and while not charming, certainly had a way with women. His girlfriend had broken up with him for sleeping with another girl, in fact, but he refused to see it that way, and considered her ‘not worth his time’. That didn’t change the fact that he found her hot. She was curvy, well-endowed, had a pretty face and a fiery temper. All of those things drew him in like ink on paper, and even now he enjoyed fantasizing about her, the way she moved when they had sex, the way she looked when he teased her, and even the way the yelled at him when she called things off. <br />
<br />
Skyler pulled down his underwear to his knees, resting his rear on the bed, as he began stroking his cock slowly from base to tip. His thoughts flowed wildly, his pace picking up as he imagined fucking his ex in this cabin right now. Hands becoming slick with precum, he had no clue the devastating mistake he was making.<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to Skyler, his body was beginning to undergo some changes with each motion of his hand. His ears were changing, becoming larger, the tips pointing and extending further out by a noticeable amount. Reshaping beneath his awareness, they were becoming alien -- unnatural. <br />
<br />
This didn’t stop Skyler, as he quickly climaxed after a few moments of imagining his ex pinned against the bed, stopping the changes, yet solidifying them as permanently different.<br />
<br />
After this, he was exhausted. He usually lasted longer jacking off than this, but it was a lot of pent up frustration in more ways than one. Regardless, he didn’t care too much, quickly cleaning off in a drowsy but happy state, and crashing onto the mattress, finding comfort and resting, thinking nothing of the world.<br />
<br />
It would be midway through the night that Rey would awake, amidst a dream he was having about his girlfriend, Nataliya. Well, it wasn’t just Nataliya, it was a few strippers as well; wet dreams don’t always make perfect sense. Nonetheless, he was very erect, and falling back asleep in such a state wouldn’t be an easy task, while rubbing his cock would be. He wasn’t fully alert or conscious, so he opted for the latter. Beneath the sheets, he stuck a hand down his pants, gripping his dick roughly and twisting it about with his thumb. He groaned into his pillow, just trying to relieve the pressure. He wasn’t in the right state of mind to notice the changes occurring, but to be fair, they weren’t as immediately noticeable as Skyler’s, not while laying down. <br />
<br />
Rey was growing taller. Proportionally throughout his body, his height was increasing, an inch here and there as he drew closer to orgasm. His clothes were getting tighter, ever so slightly, but he believed it to be part of his growing need to climax. <br />
<br />
His needs were soon met, thankfully, with him cumming all over his sheets. A sigh of relief escaped into his pillow once more. He didn’t bother cleaning anything up, he was just too tired, and thus fell back asleep quickly, feet now resting just off of the blankets that covered them moments prior.</p>
