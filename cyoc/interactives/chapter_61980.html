<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff's life for the next couple of months becomes much like it was before. TransDem's modifications ensured that the previous issues with the <br />
distance were a thing of the past, so now the entire world was aware of, and unconcerned by, the existence of a Dog-boy.<br />
<br />
Once a week, though, Jeff would be taken by Mark, or by another friend, to a nearby TV studio, where Jeff would record a new ad for <br />
TransDem. His favorite was the one they shot in the adjacent park; Jeff got to play fetch and catch for most of the day, until they got just the <br />
right shot.<br />
<br />
The ads were having an impact, too; people were expressing an interest in becoming pets. After the third ad was filmed, Larry informed Mark <br />
and Jeff that there had been 50 applicants already, and TransDem had set up a dedicated side-business to support those who applied. The <br />
requirements were that there had to be both an owner and a pet in the application, that there be no sexual association between the two prior <br />
to application, and that the owner must have had experience owning a pet. Also, they set a lower limit on applicants' ages, so that the <br />
prospective pet had to be at least 13, and those under the age of 18 had to have parental approval; that last part was established by a rapid law <br />
put in place by various governments around the world.<br />
<br />
It was the day of the seventh ad that Jeff was introduced to another pet. Caroline had only been a pet for a couple of days, and was still getting <br />
her bearings somewhat. Jeff noticed that Caroline kept subtly trying to adjust her clothes to cover her chest and crotch more, although she <br />
showed no signs of actually being uncomfortable with them on display as they were. Caroline's owner, her brother Alan, was only 15, and was <br />
still shocked that her sister wanted to become a pet, although he wanted the best for her, and always wanted a real pet (his pet mouse, <br />
although treated well, just wasn't the same).<br />
<br />
Caroline, like Jeff, had a dog-like personality. Jeff had heard that some pets (by this time, already in the thousands) chose other personalities, <br />
with cats and horses being the more common choices. Larry had brought her in so that they could do an ad showing two dog-people <br />
interacting. However, they ran into a slight problem.<br />
<br />
Jeff was erect the moment he saw Caroline. And despite knowing that he shouldn't, Jeff couldn't help but flirt excessively with her, and Caroline <br />
was all too attentive to it. Mark and Alan had to keep both on a tight leash to keep them from jumping each other. Larry quickly called off the <br />
shoot, and instead filmed two separate commercials; Caroline was remarkably photogenic.<br />
<br />
Larry called Mark a couple of weeks later, and asked to be put on speaker-phone, so Jeff could hear, too. Larry then explained that the sexual <br />
incident with Caroline had given TransDem researchers an idea. Apparently, there were two problems that had arisen - first, sexuality between <br />
pets had become a problem, especially when they were of different personalities. Second, the issue of breeding had been raised. And in coming <br />
up with a solution to these problems, TransDem had thought of a new modification. They wanted Jeff to sign off on it, being the spokesperson <br />
for both TransDem and pet-people. And so, Jeff and Mark were asked to come in to the head office.<br />
<br />
Jeff found himself sitting in an office emblazoned with the TransDem logo, reading through the details of the new modification. TransDem's <br />
idea was to make small genetic modifications to the various pet-people. These modifications would make them slightly more like their <br />
respective pets. The key difference was that everyone would be altered psychologically to be attracted by matching behavior patterns, that is <br />
humans would only be attracted to humans who had human-like behavior and dog-boys would only be attracted to girls who had dog-like <br />
behavior. TransDem had thought about making the physical changes more dramatic but working with Jeff and several others, they realized that <br />
most pet people wanted options and this gave them the most options. This also had the added benefit of ending some of the more destructive <br />
sexual deviancies such as rape. They didn't want to limit sexual freedom but they could set people so no one wanted to use anyone ever again. <br />
Other physical changes would enable pets to also get jobs more suited to their chosen personality. Jeff liked this, as his engineering studies <br />
were not nearly as interesting to him, being a pet, as they had been prior to his change, but it was where his aptitude was.<br />
<br />
Intelligence and related traits would not be affected, but physical adjustments would be made to provide both variety and genetic similarity. <br />
Genetics was set so that dog-people would birth dog-people. cat-people would birth cat-people. They couldn't quite remove the possibility of <br />
sex between different kinds of pet people and humans but they did set it so that the children would have a definite mind set toward one or the <br />
other mind-set of the parents preventing mixed mind sets.<br />
<br />
Jeff had two sets of decisions to make. The first was whether this plan was something he supported. The second was that, if he went ahead <br />
with it, what variations did he want?<br />
<br />
Jeff thought about what sort of profession he wanted to enter. Of the various choices, he narrowed it down quickly, and found one that <br />
sounded fascinating.<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;There is an option to be a beagle and help at the airport?&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry said, &quot;Well, the police are uncertain about this. They use beagles at the airport because beagles do not intimidate people, so the beagle <br />
can wander among passengers and sniff out any drug smugglers without making innocent passengers nervous. Some of the police have <br />
questioned if a naked dog boy could also wander among the passengers without making people nervous. We told them that since you have <br />
opposable thumbs, that could make up for the awkwardness. They'll give it a try and see if it works out.<br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to be a sniffer-beagle-boy, and join the police force in that capacity. He pictured himself, wearing a dog-boy vest with a badge on <br />
it. In fact, in addition to the acute sense of smell, he'd probably also be able to get some other enhancements that would suit a police-dog-<br />
boy.<br />
<br />
And so, he signed on the dotted line of the first form, giving his consent. Then he began to fill out the second form.<br />
<br />
The receptionist then asked Jeff to enter the room; she asked that Mark remain seated, as this was to be a private decision, even the owner <br />
wasn't allowed unless the pet requested it. Jeff glanced back at Mark, then leaned forward and bounded into the office.<br />
<br />
Larry accepted Jeff's papers, and sat down at a computer, with a woman Jeff didn't know standing by his side. Larry introduced the woman to <br />
Jeff, but all Jeff really cared to notice was that she was one of the researchers. Larry began to key the details into the computer, turning to the <br />
woman when necessary. Then Larry began asking questions that were specific to the choices Jeff had made.<br />
<br />
Soon, Larry turned back to Jeff and asked him to look at the screen. Jeff examined the visualization that was generated of what Jeff would look <br />
like, with markers indicating appropriate modifications to features. Jeff gave the OK, and Larry hit the button.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt the main Chronivac emitter within the building activate as a wave of distortion passed through the building. Larry explained, even as <br />
the changes began, that TransDem had a special version of the Chronivac installed within the building, but Jeff was more interested in the <br />
changes.<br />
<br />
First, Jeff saw his nose grow larger, and he turned to a mirror that was off to the side, that Larry had arranged to have there for Jeff. Jeff <br />
watched, fascinated, as the lower edge of his nose turned up somewhat, and darkened to a reddish brown color. He smiled as the edges of his <br />
nostrils became wetter. Jeff's jaws then protruded forward ever-so-slightly, and without thinking about it, he let his tongue hang out of his <br />
mouth. He smiled again as his tongue hung comfortably past his lip, although not making it all the way to his chin without effort. He <br />
instinctively licked his upper lip and nostrils, then noticed the elongated canines he had been given.<br />
<br />
Larry explained features as they formed; Jeff would be able to eat raw meat, and those canines were sharp enough to tear into it... but he was <br />
still going to be omnivorous. Jeff detected an odor in the air, but couldn't determine what it was, only that it was somewhere to his left. <br />
Looking back at the mirror, Jeff noted that his nose had rounded out slightly, and that his nose had grown just enough to make his eyes tilt <br />
slightly outward. The whites of Jeff's eyes were still there, but took up significantly less of his eyes than they had. His face remained mostly <br />
human despite the distinctive nose and other slight changes. His ears became floppy but matched his hair color and hair type.<br />
<br />
Jeff then felt the musculo-skeletal changes start to kick in. His upper body bulked up somewhat, giving his upper body a shape more suited to <br />
wrestling or boxing. His lower body, instead, stretched out more, his legs and abdominal region growing enough to boost his height to about 6 <br />
feet and 8 inches... but then he naturally bent his knees and leaned forward somewhat so that, at rest, he stood about 6 feet even. His feet were <br />
also longer, but less wide. He didn't need Larry to tell him that he would now be an exceptional runner, easily out-pacing a human.<br />
<br />
Larry asked Jeff to look at his backside. Jeff twisted, finding the movement significantly easier than it used to be, and looked back to find that <br />
his tail-bone had pushed outward a small amount. Smiling, he watched as it began to twitch back and forward. It grew into a tail but as Jeff had <br />
requested, it would bend to allow Jeff to still be able to sit in chairs. Jeff bent his tail beneath him and found it long enough to cover his belly <br />
button. This wasn't a necessity since the social changes allowed pet-people to be naked but Jeff liked the option anyway.<br />
<br />
Jeff then noticed his body hair becoming more fur like. The fur did not cover his entire body but he now had a distinct treasure trail. Also the <br />
coloring of his fur was more similar to a beagle so that Jeff now had faint orange spots on the otherwise white fur on his back.<br />
<br />
Jeff began to notice a soft humming sound, and looked around. It seemed to be coming from near Larry. Paying closer attention, he realized <br />
that it was the sound of the computer; he hadn't heard a sound until now, but he could definitely hear a high-pitched hum.<br />
<br />
Larry walked up to Jeff, and began to scratch gently behind Jeff's right ear. Jeff's tongue lolled out and he smiled broadly, showing his canine <br />
teeth. Then he again smelled that enticing scent he had caught earlier. Looking again to his left, he started to look around, trying to find the <br />
source of the smell. Larry laughed softly and suggested that Jeff look in the drawer he had zeroed in on.<br />
<br />
Inside, Jeff found a piece of steak. It was raw, and he salivated quickly at smelling it so strongly. He quickly associated in his mind the scent <br />
with raw steak. He reached out to grab it, but then paused and looked back at Larry, his ears stiffened and his tail-bone twitching excitedly. <br />
With a subtle nod from Larry, Jeff grabbed the steak and started to tear at it with his canines. Ever bit of flavor from the blood was bringing <br />
more enjoyment for Jeff, and he began to swallow chunks of meat whole as he tore them off. As he finished the steak off, he rapidly licked up <br />
the blood on his hands with his large tongue, and then proceeded to lick up the splattered blood from the floor, finding himself more at ease <br />
on four limbs than he had previously.<br />
<br />
Larry opened the door, and Jeff ran back out to Mark, talking excitedly about how great the changes were. Mark looked Jeff over, then smiled <br />
and nodded to Larry and put Jeff back on his leash. Jeff kept talking about it on the drive home, about how he was going to be a police sniffer-<br />
dog-boy, and how much he wanted to try out his new body. When they stopped at the park, Mark pulled out a tennis ball and suggested that <br />
they play fetch. Jeff's face lit up and it was on.<br />
<br />
Jeff was definitely a lot faster. Mark threw the ball as hard as he could, in various directions, and Jeff managed to reach and grab it within one <br />
bounce, every time, sometimes even catching it in his mouth. Jeff was finding it a little too restrictive, and asked Mark if he could go for a run. <br />
Mark assented, and Jeff began to run around the large park lake. Mark couldn't help but smile as he watched his friend-turned-pet darting <br />
around the lake, sometimes stopping to smell or even taste things that caught his interest. A few other people in the park remarked on how <br />
beautiful he was, and Mark smiled even more broadly.<br />
<br />
After about 20 minutes of this, Mark decided it was time to head home. He pulled out a dog whistle that he had been given by the secretary, <br />
and Jeff quickly perked up at the sound, not realizing that it was a higher pitch than humans could hear. Mark quickly bundled Jeff back into <br />
the car, and they headed home.<br />
<br />
Jeff heard that Caroline had gotten the change as well but Tony and Caroline had gone to a family reunion so Jeff would have to wait to find out <br />
how she looked now. In the meantime, Jeff met some new friends. There was Pete and his dog-boy Josh who was working as a guard dog. <br />
There was the Hansens with their son and two daughters and their dog-girl Callie who was working as an assistant to the disabled Mrs. <br />
Hansen. Jeff also met Joe and Sam who were pony-boys pulling carts around the city.<br />
<br />
When Jeff showed up to work, officer Denney pulled him aside. &quot;I know your in training still but a human would learn faster than you are. You <br />
walk around with your tongue hanging out. You scratch yourself in public. You even get erections in public. I'm afraid we're going to have to <br />
send you to obedience school.</p>
