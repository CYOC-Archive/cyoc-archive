<br />
Stephanie and I followed Angelica back to Professor McDoohan's office. Once we got there we were immediately shown into her office. Friday was sitting in one of the chairs talking to Professor McDoohan. Both of them looked up when we entered. Evidently Friday could see that something was wrong since he asked &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We just found out that we're pregnant&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn those aliens!&quot; Friday said. &quot;They don't give any thought to the mothers. They impregnate them and usually come back in two months to take the babies. You want to know why Agent Nash is the way he is? I'll tell you why. He will be angry with me for revealing it to you but I think you need to know to understand him. He wasn't always like this. Ten years ago he was dedicated to his job as a police officer. Everyone said that he was a kind, family man. He was as tough with criminals as he needed to be. His reputation grew so much that the criminals would pray that it was Officer Nash who busted them. Then one day aliens abducted his sixteen year old daughter and impregnated her. A couple months later they abducted her again and took her baby. The doctors insisted that it was a spontaneous abortion though Officer Nash and his daughter knew better. They tried to tell people that it was aliens that took the baby. Nobody believed them and Officer Nash was suspended pending a psychological evaluation. A week later his daughter committed suicide. He was devastated by this. His daughter was the only one he had left after his wife died in a car crash a few years earlier. She had written a suicide note saying that she couldn't live with the knowledge that she was impregnated by aliens, then her losing her baby to them, and nobody believing her besides her father. He was the one who found her body. It wasn't a pretty sight. She had taken half a bottle of pain pills and then slit her wrists. She made sure that she died slowly. At some point she vomited all over herself. Of course he blamed her death on the aliens and made it his mission to hunt them down. He eventually lost his job and he became depressed. He was by no means suicidal since he had a mission in his life. In the pursuit of his mission he turned to crime to finance his mission. He was caught and jailed. It was there that I found him and offered him a chance to find those aliens. We erased everyone's memories of Officer Nash and purged his record. Understand that Agent Nash is a good man. He just went through a very hard time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's awful!&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is&quot; Friday said. &quot;Agent Nash has been looking for the aliens that took his grandbaby ten years ago. Perhaps if he finds them and his grandbaby he'll cheer up a bit and be his old self again. I hope that that'll be the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No wonder he wanted to shoot me&quot; Stephanie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see that you understand&quot; Friday said. &quot;I need to ask you something about your abductions. How were you abducted?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They chased me in my car&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;When my car stalled I got out and ran. I hit my head on a branch and was knocked out. I woke up near where I was knocked out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Friday said. &quot;What about you Richelle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was home reading when I heard someone calling for help&quot; I said. &quot;When I finally went to investigate I saw the UFO in a clearing in the woods. I went inside and saw the aliens and they shot me with some type of gun. I woke up back in my house thinking that it was a dream until I saw myself and figured out that it wasn't a dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this is good news&quot; Friday said. &quot;If they plan on coming back for your babies they have to set down and physically take you aboard their ship. It doesn't sound like they had beaming technology.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you may be able to nail them?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We hope so&quot; Friday said. &quot;Enough of that though. Have you decided whether to stay here or at home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll stay here&quot; I said. &quot;I want to be close to the doctors in case something happens with my baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll stay here too&quot; Stephanie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Professor McDoohan said. &quot;You can have your pick of any empty room that you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Professor&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agent Friday will take you home to get what you need&quot; Professor McDoohan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that you can probably teleport home Richelle&quot; Friday said. &quot;I want to take you however.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you'll excuse us Professor&quot; Friday said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Professor McDoohan said. &quot;You may go.&quot;<br />
<br />
About an hour later I was back home. Nash had volunteered to accompany me home. Now I was sitting in the living room with my mom, dad, Michelle, and Nash. I took a deep breath and said &quot;I've decided to stay at the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that's your decision sweetie&quot; Mom said. &quot;I'll miss you but it might be for the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you want to stay at the school?&quot; Dad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure Dad&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least you can come home whenever you want to&quot; Michelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is that&quot; Mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's something else&quot; I said. &quot;I don't know how to break this gently to you so I'll just say it.&quot; I took another deep breath and said &quot;I'm pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nash shouted &quot;THOSE FUCKING ALIENS! I'M GOING TO TAG EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please calm down Agent Nash&quot; Mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't know aliens like I do!&quot; Nash said. &quot;They took my daughter from me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Dad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They abducted her, impregnated her, and then took the baby&quot; Nash said. &quot;She couldn't handle it so she committed suicide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's horrible!&quot; Mom said. &quot;How do you live with that knowledge?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nash didn't say anything so I said &quot;He has made it his mission to track down those aliens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know that?&quot; Nash asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Agent Friday told us&quot; I said. &quot;He wanted us to understand why you are the way you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it that these aliens will be back&quot; Dad said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's almost a certainty&quot; Nash said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They may not be back though&quot; I said. &quot;Agent Friday said that it doesn't sound like they have beaming technology. That will make it harder for them to take our babies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Stephanie pregnant too?&quot; Michelle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes she is&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't see how you could be pregnant&quot; Dad said. &quot;From what you told us it just seems impossible. Insects can't mate with humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am pregnant though&quot; I said. &quot;I don't know how they impregnated me. Maybe they had some spunk from a guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it was your own spunk&quot; Michelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you say!?!&quot; Nash asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was joking around when I said it might have been her own spunk that the aliens used&quot; Michelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could that happen?&quot; Nash said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Richelle was a teenage boy before the aliens abducted her&quot; Mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that's the case then they may indeed have harvested sperm from her before they transformed her&quot; Nash said. &quot;They could have used it to impregnate her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've heard of brothers and sisters having babies before&quot; Dad said. &quot;The babies usually have something wrong with them since there isn't enough of a genetic difference. I wonder if there will be anything wrong with Richelle's baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean my baby may not be healthy!&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't know if they used your own sperm to impregnate you&quot; Mom said. &quot;They may have used Stephanie's.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It may also be that if they did use your own sperm, the transformation may have changed your genetic structure enough that it's not a concern&quot; Nash said. &quot;I'm sure that DNA tests can be done to make sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I'll just have to wait then&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are here for you&quot; Mom said. &quot;Once your baby is born we'll help you take care of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate that&quot; I said. &quot;Though I hope that I won't have to have you take care of my baby too often. The school does have a nursery. I think that I may see if I can help in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a wonderful idea&quot; Mom said. &quot;Why don't you go pack and I'll fix supper. You're welcome to have supper with us Agent Nash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's very kind of you Mrs. O'Toole&quot; Nash said. &quot;Especially considering what I would have done yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think nothing of it&quot; Mom said. &quot;I understand why you acted like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle helped me pack while Nash watched. I was a little uncomfortable about this but I understood it. He was watching over me in case the aliens came back. He kept his hand near his Tagger which made me a little nervous. After I was packed we had had supper and then it was time to go back to school. I said a tearful goodbye and promised that I would come see them on the weekends. Friday pulled up and Nash helped me put my stuff in the car along with Stephanie's. We then left for our new lives. I just hoped that it would be a good one.</p>
