<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It has been a few hours since I downloaded the app and clicked the big green &quot;Start&quot; button and nothing.<br />
<br />
But then I matched with guy named Ian on LoveRacoon, I got a small sample of his profile, he was a few years younger than me maybe 29 or 20 and I gotta say, I wasn&#39;t really feeling it. He seemed nice and all, but he was just so fucking nerdy. And I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a bad thing or anything, it&#39;s just not really my type.<br />
<br />
But I felt like I had to talk to him, you know? I made a commitment to this TaskRacoon thing, and I didn&#39;t wanna get in trouble. So I started chatting with Ian, and we talked about all sorts of shit. He seemed really into video games and anime and stuff, and I tried to act interested, but I just couldn&#39;t really get into it.<br />
<br />
And then Ian starts talking about wanting to meet up with me, and I&#39;m like, &quot;uh, I don&#39;t know, man.&quot; But he&#39;s really insistent, and I feel like I can&#39;t really say no. I mean, I agreed did agree to 24 engagements, so I guess I should be willing to meet up with him too. I let him know I would be down to hang out in an hour and he sends me his address which isn&#39;t too far from where I live.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t believe what was happening to me again. It seemed whatever sort of strange magic or technology that was on TaskRacoon was on LoveRacoon too. As I walked towards this boy&#39;s house, my body begins to change even more rapidly. My muscles bulge and tighten, my skin takes on a darker hue, and my facial features become more angular. With each step, I feel more confident and powerful.. <br />
<br />
As I approached the house, memories flooded my mind. Memories of working out for hours on end, pushing my body to the limits, and obsessing over every inch of my muscles. It was like I had lived this life before, but it wasn&#39;t mine. <br />
And then, as I knocked on the door, I could feel my chest and nipples becoming hyper-sensitive. I had never experienced anything like this before. My mind was filled with my desire for having nerdy gay boys play with his chest and nipples. <br />
<br />
 I can see the Ian&#39;s face through the glass, and I can tell that he&#39;s excited to see me. I ring the doorbell, and he quickly opens the door, his eyes widening as he see&#39;s me. When the door opened, I was met with the cutest little thing I had ever seen. He was definitely nerdy, but in the best possible way. He had these big, round glasses, super skinny body. I found myself very interested in him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jae-ho!&quot; he exclaimed, practically jumping into my arms. &quot;I&#39;m so glad you could make it!  You look amazing,&quot; he says, his voice filled with awe. I wrapped my arms around him, feeling the power in my biceps and triceps. It was like I was holding him with someone else&#39;s arms, someone who was much stronger than I ever was. But the boy didn&#39;t seem to mind. He just snuggled up against me, his head resting on my massive chest.<br />
<br />
I can feel my nipples hardening under my shirt as he speaks, and I realize that I&#39;m desperate for his touch. Without hesitation, I take his hand and lead him to the couch, where I pull off my shirt and reveal my massive pecs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Touch them,&quot; I say, my voice low and commanding.<br />
<br />
The Ian hesitates for a moment, but then he reaches out and runs his hands over my chest, massaging my nipples gently. I moan in pleasure, and my whole body shudders with delight.<br />
<br />
As he started playing with my nipples. I had never felt anything like it before. It was like every touch was sending electric shocks throughout my body. I could feel myself getting harder and harder, my own nipples becoming erect with desire. <br />
<br />
&quot;More,&quot; I say, my voice growing more urgent. &quot;I want more.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nerdy boy grins and leans in, taking one of my nipples in his mouth and sucking on it hard. I gasp at the sensation, feeling a wave of pleasure wash over me. &quot;I love how dominant you are Jae...&quot; he moans.<br />
<br />
I grab the boy&#39;s head and pull him closer, pressing my lips to his in a fierce kiss. He moans and writhes under me, his hands roaming over my massive chest and down to my abs.<br />
<br />
I pull away from the kiss, panting and sweating, and I can see the hunger in his eyes. I know that he wants me as much as I want him, and I&#39;m more than happy to oblige.<br />
<br />
With a fierce growl, I pick him up and carry him to the bedroom, throwing him onto the bed. I climb on top of him, my muscles rippling as I pin him down with my weight.  I could looked around his room, saw that it was filled with all sorts of anime toys and video game posters.  And there was large mirror for the closet door. In the reflection I saw Ian the skinny nerdy guy still clothed underneath a muscular Asian bodybuilder with his shirt off. For a flash whatever that remained of Josh thought how absurd this all looked but it was quickly pushed away by how hot I thought it looked.<br />
<br />
Ian with what very little strength he had encouraged me to lay on the bed with a push, he was straddling me with his slim hips. He reached down and started playing with my nipples again, this time with more intensity. I could feel myself getting lost in the sensation, my body responding to every touch.<br />
And then he leaned down and started kissing me. He was clearly experienced in the art of kissing, and he was teaching me something new with every movement of his tongue.<br />
<br />
As we kissed, he reached down and started playing with my cock. It was rock hard by this point, throbbing with desire. And then he lowered his hand and started to stroke it from underneath my underwear. <br />
<br />
&quot;I only do hand jobs...&quot; he said shly and timidly. <br />
I nodded  &quot;Same here, I hate regular sex...&quot; new memories of me not enjoying blowjobs or anal entering my mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you keep touching my chest and let me stroke or stroke me I can get off.&quot; I said with confidence. <br />
<br />
His smile grew so big &quot;When I saw your profile I knew we had to meet Jae!&quot; he said with excitement.<br />
<br />
I reached out and grabbed his hand, pulling him towards me. Our chests pressed together, and I could feel the heat radiating off of his body. I leaned down and captured his lips with mine, our tongues and lips once again making out passionately.<br />
<br />
My hands roamed over his body, exploring every inch of his thin body still wearing clothes. I could feel his cock straining against his pants, and I couldn&#39;t resist the urge to stroke it through the fabric. He moaned against my lips, his hips bucking forward as he pressed himself closer to me.<br />
<br />
I broke the kiss and looked down at him, my eyes dark with desire. &quot;Take off your pants,&quot; I growled, my voice rough and commanding.<br />
<br />
He nodded, his hands fumbling with the button and zipper of his jeans. I watched hungrily as he peeled them off, revealing a pair of tight white briefs that left little to the imagination. His cock was straining against the fabric, and I could see a wet spot forming at the tip.<br />
<br />
I reached out and ran my fingers over the damp spot, causing him to gasp and shudder. &quot;You&#39;re so fucking turned on,&quot; I murmured, my voice thick with lust.<br />
<br />
He nodded, his eyes locked on mine as I reached down and slowly pulled down his underwear, revealing his thick, hard cock. I wrapped my hand around it and began to stroke him, reveling in the feel of his warm, velvety flesh.<br />
<br />
He moaned and arched his back, pressing his chest even harder against mine. I could feel his  hands playing with chest and nipples.<br />
We stood there, lost in our own pleasure, as I continued to stroke his cock and played with my muscular chest and nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s sit like this...&quot; he said sitting up straight on the bed, I followed his lead and sat in front of him. <br />
<br />
As we sat facing each other on the bed, I could feel the sexual tension between us intensifying. The boy&#39;s hand reached out and slowly caressed my chest, tracing his fingers over each defined muscle. My cock was already rock hard in my pants, straining against the fabric as I leaned in closer to him. <br />
<br />
His fingers then reached down to my waistband, eagerly unbuttoning and unzipping my jeans. I could feel his breath on my neck as he fumbled with the zipper, finally freeing my throbbing member from its confines. <br />
<br />
Without hesitation, I reached over and took his cock in my hand, stroking it slowly at first, enjoying the way it felt in my palm. His eyes were closed, and his head was tilted back, lost in the pleasure of my touch. <br />
<br />
But I wasn&#39;t content to just stroke him. I wanted need him to feel my chest. &quot;Touch it more Ian, I need you to feel it!&quot; He opened his eyes and began to grope it and feel it more and more.<br />
<br />
I leaned forward, pressing my lips to his, our tongues dancing together in a frenzy of desire. I could feel him grabbing onto my chest, kneading my pecs with his fingers as our make-out session continued. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, I could feel myself getting close to the edge. I knew I was about to explode, so I pulled away from him, grabbing both our cocks in my hand and jerking us off together. Now that his hand was free he could feel my both of my pecs with both of his hands. It didn&#39;t take long before we were both moaning, our hot cum spraying all over each other&#39;s bodies. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn... you are perfect Jae...&quot; he said as he smiled and kissed me.<br />
We cuddled in bed for several minutes before he walked off to get a towel.<br />
On my phone I realized I had a notification from LoveRacoon, &quot;1 our 24 complete next arrangment ready&quot; it said. As I opened the app I saw the green start button was ready for me to click again.<br />
<br />
I had a choice to make, stay as Jae-ho and hope me and Ian could start something real, or be stuck in a sexy Korean bodybuilder body who only wants to do hand jobs...</p>
