<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I feel my cheeks burning hot, as my enormous dong slowly settles down after spewing my thick donkey seed into a natural-born female donkey. As it does so, I feel the familiar burning hot liquid of rancid piss begin spraying out of the thick black head between my hind legs. I feel my cheeks flushing, as I recall the humiliation of what they made me become that I felt that day. Of what my family had witnessed, and how lowly they thought of me. How lowly they think of my new kind still to this day. <br />
<br />
The facility guide finished the tour of the grounds and surrounding fields. We next turned towards a long, low building. It was white, with red and white-striped awnings over each window. The back of the building had two large, wide double doors. Someone opened them, and out walked a trainer leading a big hefty cow. As we walked past, its large sad brown eyes ponderously looked direcy at me. It left a long, low &quot;mooooo&quot; sound, as it was led to the training fields. <br />
<br />
&quot;They just finished the last patient,&quot; the guide said, stopping our group and acknowledging the cow.  &quot;That was formerly a young man named Patrick. His new handlers have dubbed her Bella.&quot;<br />
<br />
I saw the large pink udders swaying below his....her....legs where a male penis should be instead. <br />
<br />
&quot;We managed to artificially inseminate her right in the lab. In a few months, she&#39;ll be giving birth to a brand new calf. Her body will them start producing milk for the rest of her life, and she&#39;ll be giving birth to many more calves. Mostly, she&#39;ll be getting pregnant the natural way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;....anyway....moving on.... Vin, you&#39;ll be the next patient as we prepare the lab for your transformation into our newest addition.&quot;<br />
<br />
We approached a normal entrance made for humans like us. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be walking in on two legs, Vin, and walking out on fours.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stopped, trembling. I looked back at the cow being led away. It was looking back towards me. I was looking at its hooves. Soon, a set of those instead of hands and feet, will be adorning my four legs.<br />
<br />
My stomach was twisting in knots. I felt like I was being led towards my execution. In a way, I suppose I was. I suppose those being led to their execution, knowing they were soon going to have their lifeless body being placed inside the wooden coffin sitting before them, all feel exactly like this. I&#39;d rather was an execution than to be trapped the way I currently am now. <br />
<br />
The guards pushed me along after the rest of the group. We entered inside of a lobby, where they had comfortable-looking furniture and provided coffeee and snacks. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be waiting in here while we prepare the lab just beyond that door.&quot; <br />
<br />
To the right in the waiting lobby area, was a large steel door. On the other side of the forboding baricade, my doom awaited me. <br />
<br />
They told us to take our seats and get comfortable. It would be a while. The guards were posted at the doors. The guide went through another door, straight ahead. Must be an access to the rest of the building. It was securely locked with one of those keycode electronic locks. <br />
<br />
I was agitated. My family were all speaking in low hushed tones. Looking at me periodically. My mom tried offering me one of the snacks, but I couldn&#39;t think of touching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, honey. It&#39;ll be the last time you&#39;ll ever taste this food.&quot; As if that made anything better. She also tried getting me to sit, also.unhelpfully reminding me it would be the last time I would ever have the opportunity to sit and relax in a nice comfy chair. It would also be the last time I get to stand on my own two legs. <br />
<br />
The time passed both slowly and quickly at the same time. Each minute that ticked by, was one less minute I got to spend with my own body. Beyond being reminded by my own mother that I would never again eat human food, I dont remember any of the final conversations going on while around my family. We were there for about a  hour or two, when a nurse with another guard came through the door the guide left through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, Vin Salvatore?&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt weak. I collapsed to the floor, sobbing. <br />
<br />
&quot;No. I dont want- I dont want to become a donkey. I just wanna go home!&quot;<br />
<br />
Two guards came over, and grabbed me by the arms. They forcefully pulled me back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well. This way then,&quot; said the nurse as the guards dragged me along towards the big steel door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! Please! Make them stop!&quot; I looked back, and saw my mother looking at me stoically. Ant with a wide grin on his face as he waved at me. That was the last time I saw either of their faces. A guard was standing in front of my father.<br />
<br />
We entered through the thick steel door and into a wide, brightly lit room. There was a huge table in the center of the room. The large double doors that a cow formerly named Patrick walked out of not even two hours earlier was to the right.<br />
<br />
A big burly man dressed up like a doctor approached. &quot;Put him on the table over there, and roll up his sleeve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terrified, I was roughly dragged over to the table, lifted up while kicking and screaming, and thrown even more roughly on top of the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;This would proceed much more smoothly if you just calm down,&quot; said one of the guards. &quot;It isnt like you&#39;re going to lose your life.&quot; Except that I was.<br />
<br />
Struggling, another guard came over and grabbed me by the shoulders and slammed me down onto the table in lying position. One of the guards rolled up one of my sleeves, abd the doctor jabbed me with something.<br />
<br />
&quot;There! That&#39;ll do it. Now. Don&#39;t worry son. That wasnt the treatment just yet. It was just a muscle relaxant.&quot;<br />
<br />
The effect was nearly instant. I felt my body get heavy, then I felt like I was all floaty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now strip him of his clothes, bag them, and make sure his parents get them. This kid has a two  brother, and I&#39;m sure he could use them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ant could use my clothes alright. He was notorious for stealing them.<br />
<br />
They stripped me completely naked. There I was. My underdeveloped naked 15 year old teenage body. Still havent quite started growing body hair yet. I was completely helpless. Couldnt move a muscle, except for my neck a little bit. I then noticed mirrors. Two large mirrors lining either side of both walls to the right and the left. As well as a large mirror hanging from the ceiling above me. I was clearly able to see my cute young boyish Italian features. My big brown eyes. My perfectly formed white teeth. I looked exactly ljne Ant in every way. My chest slowly rising and falling as my body continued to relax. My mind was also relaxing. My mind easing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now. For the main event.&quot; said the doctor.<br />
<br />
He came over with a huge needle full of thick white liquidy crap. He swabbed the left side of my torso, and injected me with it. At first, it was cold. But then started burning a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;This doesn&#39;t take very long, &quot; he explained.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, a rash developed in that spot. That rash turned dark. The darkness slowly spread around my skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s your new hide coming in already,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; I barely managed, as I looked up at the ceiling.<br />
<br />
I could see little gray and white hairs begin poking out of my thick, black skin that continued spreading. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; I squeaked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too late for that now. Just enjoy the show.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guards and the doctor all backed away, giving me a perfect view if my bidy twisting and reshaping. It wasnt painful. I just lay there, watching with semi-detached interest as the dark leathern hide slowly encased or replaced my smooth human skin over my belly, my chest, and my sides. White hairs spreading over my front, turning to gray hairs in my sides.<br />
<br />
I then started feeling bloated. My stomach and intestines began gurgling. A little bit of fat began to form on my sides, and nice chest and stomach began to lose what devrlopnent I started gaining this year from lifting with my brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Im...im getting fat,&quot; I murmered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re still quite thin, compared to the obese mass your body will become.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dark hide continued spreading. Onto my limbs. My shoulders, hips, and thighs, even as my body slowly continued bulking up. It approached my privates. I watched, with ill fascination, as it began covering my balls. <br />
<br />
The hide seemed to speed up. Covering my biceps, forearms, and calves. It went up my neck. Everywhere, gray and white furry hair folllwing it.<br />
<br />
I then heard and felt my wrist and ankle joints begin to crackle and grow, as i felt my balls begin to inflate! I still had a strange detached interest as I watched and felt my entire body betray my former humanity. <br />
<br />
I then felt my hands and feet begin to feel stiff. I knew exactly what was about to happen. I was about to cross over into the stuff of my nightmares. The loss of my precious hands!<br />
<br />
All I could do, was lift my neck and look over my rapidly transforming body. I was looking like a human wearing a gray donkey fursuit, as my hands and feet all turned into hooves simultaneously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nooooo!&quot; I said, as I tried flexing my rapidly diminishing fingers and toes, when I began choking. My insides were beginning to transform as well, as my neck was swelling. I could actually feel my voicebox changing shape and growing! <br />
<br />
My &quot;nooooo&quot; slowly morphed into a long &quot;Haaaaaaawwwwww!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
My balls really began blowing up. Turning into large black grapefruits as they bregan churning. Another long loud &quot;Haaaaaaaaawwwwww!!!&quot; escaped my thickening lips, as I felt my penis grow. I watched it extend and morph. It was the sickest sight I&#39;ve ever seen! It was growing from the base to the tip like a tree sprouting in fast forward mode. At tbe same time, the black leathery skin also grew from the base towards the tip. When  it reached the tip, the tip changed shape! It flared out from my normal mushroom-shaped head, to a flared elephant trunk shape with one huge hole. <br />
<br />
As it grew and morphed, it also stiffened! I never felt anything like it in my entire life! The feeling was so immeasurable and indescribable, that I couldnt contain myself. I had to bang all four of my now fully-formed hooves on the table and leave forth my first full-throated bray.<br />
<br />
&quot;hhheee hhhaaww hheee hhaaww hheee hhaaww!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then it seemed to stop. The feeling quickly dissipated. I was left breathing heavily, lying on my back. A large black leathery hunk of skin drew up over my new disgusting monster cock between my leg. I was terrified and stunned completely into silence. I couldnt belueve it! I now had a donkey dick for a dick. And not just any donkey dick either. The exact same dick as the donkey out in the stables I had met earlier. The exact same dick I was looking at with total disgust as piss was coming out of it like a firehose. That very same dick is now between MY legs! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww&quot; I weakly brayed. No longer ever to be able to form words.<br />
<br />
Then it started up again! This time, up my face and into my bones. I could feel and hear bones cracking and watched as my arms grew longer and reshaped into legs. At this point, I just completely gave up all hope and began to accept my new form and decided to just let it happen. <br />
<br />
I felt my cheekbones cracking, and could see my face turning into a snout. My teeth grew to obnoxious sizes, as they thrust out from behind my still mostly human lips. They turned into large blocky rectangles, and became yellow. The saliva in my mouth thickened and turned sour as my teeth turned yellow with rotting black outlines. My tongue puffed up, and became the tongue of my new donkey twin. That thought made me sick. I now had that damn donkey&#39;s mout! Its nasty sticky saliva was now my saliva! <br />
<br />
In the back of my mind, I wanted to gag. To hurl. But I was still kind of mentally detached as my head was deforming into that of a simer species. In addition, a new event was taking place. First, I could feel my spinal column stretching, and my tailbone pushing out. It was sort of a pleasant feeling. But my hips started cracking as my new hind legs began pulling up at the same time my former arms did. I then shifted position, as I rolled onto my left side. A mirror on the far wall allowed me to watch the rest of my transformation in this same detached horror. My new huge balls slid sideways and wobbled for a few seconds. I could feel them filling with my donkey twin&#39;s thick nasty sperm. <br />
<br />
It was like a disgusting movie. Nothing at all like Pinnochio. Real people being turned into real donkeys is much more horrific than in a cartoon. It no longer looked like me on that table at all. Not at all. Except maybe my eyes. I still had my spikey black human hair and forehead. I wouldn&#39;t believe this was happening to me, of I couldn&#39;t also feel the changes.<br />
<br />
As all four of my legs moved outward to accomodate my new four legged posture, I could see the bottoms of my new hooves reflected in the mirror. Apparently, I still had the palms of my hands and bottoms of my feet, but my fingers and toes were completely gone. They had turned into the leading edges of my still-forming hooves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhaaww!&quot; I moaned in discomfort as it seemed to take a bit of a break.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry, wont be long now. Your internal organs are currently changing in order to take care of your new bulk before you continue to grow any larger.<br />
<br />
And he was right! I could feel my intestines squirming around. My prostrate was growing larger. I then felt my rear end open up, as my body grossly expelled whatever human waste I had left inside. Human turds came tumbling out without my command!<br />
<br />
&quot; well, at least this one wasnt a squirter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaaawwwww!!&quot; I said in reply.<br />
<br />
I then felt and saw whatever was left of my feet and hands disappear as my hooves finally fully completed their changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaaww hhheee hhaawww!&quot; I lamented as I struggled to bang them on the table top, which took entirely too much effort in my current awkward side position and still with some of that muscle relaxant drug in my system. <br />
<br />
All the sudden, my girth started expanding. Again! I saw a scale read out for the first time. It was above 400 lbs. How damn large was I going to get!? I now weigh 400 freaking lbs!? And the number kept ticking up!<br />
<br />
I felt and saw my shoulders, hips, and sides slowly expand as all four of my legs separated further apart. My ribcage, especially, was pushing outward, even as a a thick layer of fat and muscle formed above it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeeerrrrgghhh hhhaawww!&quot; my &quot;voice&quot; was getting deeper and more animalistic!<br />
<br />
I then felt my lungs expand. I was forced to breath out a long long, low &quot;hhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwww!!!!!&quot; As they did so. I felt my heart pump harder and harder as it, too, expanded.<br />
<br />
500 lbs. And STILL growing! I couldnt looj ovsr the bulk of my gray hairy shoulder any longer. I could barely see the upper part of my right leg. But I could clearly look down and see my hoof-tipped lower front legs. I just lay there, staring at my two front hooves in horrific fasciniation as my body continued expanding. &quot;Haaawwww!&quot; I said sadly, drool dripping out of my gross deformed mouth. <br />
<br />
Then my neck started growing! This was weird, and I can&#39;t describe it. My neck was pushing my head outward as my perspective slowly changed. My jaw then began expanding again, as my lips turned jet black and finally covered my donkey &quot;chompers.&quot; At the same time, my face pushed further and further forward as my nostrils flared. <br />
<br />
My head was now changing into the head of my new donkey twin, slowly obliterating whatever human features I had left. If my hooves didn&#39;t mark me as a donkey on a permanant basis, my head surely will. <br />
<br />
My face continued expanding into its proper assinine proportions. My eyesight &quot;split,&quot; and the world of colors slowly faded. My eyeballs were devolving into those of my new species. The rods and cones which make up the sharp human vision of color, were disappearing as my dark irises took over most of my eye balls. <br />
<br />
The top of my skull was sloping, as my earholes shifted position closer to the top of my head. I thought all my other donkifying features were bad enough. But my ears began stretching!<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrgghh hhhhaawww!&quot; I cried, as the top of my head was now going to forever be crowned by two tall broad pointers. My ears kept growing. And growing. And growing! Please! Make them stop! I thought. Eventually, they did. And i discovered they could swivel around up there. My hearing was also sharpened. Sgarpened to the point where loud noises will now bother me. <br />
<br />
The top of my head continued resgaping, as my human head hair coursesned and expanded down my back into my new mane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Errrrgghh hhhaawww!&quot; I exclaimed as I now was officially a donkey. But it wasnt completely over yet. I continued gaining weight! 700 lbs. 800. 900. 1000! 1100. 1200. 1300. 1400! I saw my sides expanding. Pushing out into obesity. The scale didnt stop there!<br />
<br />
1500 lbs. 1,550! It finally settled down to 1,596 lbs! <br />
<br />
....and it was over! I was now nothing but a fat obese smelly old 1600lb farm animal!</p>
