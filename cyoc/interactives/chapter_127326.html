<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Christmas was a time for families, there were still plenty who wanted to enjoy some very private time with their bond-mates. The adult Christmas party at the Meat Market wasn&#39;t the place for such displays. It wasn&#39;t really appropriate for such a hallowed day. However, in the privacy of their own homes, they were able to act on their desires.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
While Beth&#39;s parents were perfectly fine with her relationship with Lizzie, they understandably didn&#39;t want to be within hearing range when they were feeling frisky. So after they spent a nice time at Beth&#39;s house with her family, they went back to Lizzie&#39;s house. It was a lot more private since Lizzie lived there alone, Misty having moved out to be with her mate. But that was fine with them. There was fine with them. There was no reason for them to remain modest there.<br />
<br />
The two of them were enjoying some time in Lizzie&#39;s bedroom. But they weren&#39;t naked yet. They had gotten some nice dressing gowns for Christmas and they were both wearing them. But that didn&#39;t stop them from sticking a hand into each other&#39;s robes and groping at their lover&#39;s breasts. Eventually, Lizzie pulled away and purred, &quot;Ready for your present?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Lizzie, there&#39;s something I need to...confess about,&quot; said Beth.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s about the way you lied about how you got infected, I already knew about it,&quot; said Lizzie, &quot;Though I can&#39;t imagine why you say that a neighbor&#39;s dog bit you and you got infected washing off the bite than just saying that Killer bit you as he was changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it would sound cooler, I guess,&quot; said Beth, &quot;Everyone else was being bitten by their pets. I wanted to be a bit more original. But that&#39;s what I need to fess up about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Lizzie, a bit concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not that I&#39;m getting tired of your or love you any less. But...I&#39;ve been looking at Killer and...um, well...&quot; started Beth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re starting to feel attracted to him,&quot; said Lizzie.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m falling for him. He&#39;s like family to me. But I notice that-&quot; started Beth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re finding him sexually appealing,&quot; said Lizzie, &quot;Relax, Beth. It&#39;s perfectly natural for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is?&quot; asked Beth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody told you?&quot; asked Lizzie. She paused and thought it over. &quot;Oh, well, I suppose it&#39;s not the sort of thing that just arises in conversations. Beth, I think we&#39;re overdue for a talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s about the birds and the bees, i think we&#39;re a little too far past that,&quot; said Beth dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not precisely,&quot; said Lizzie, &quot;As you know, Beth, uplifted Animalians are always heterosexual. That&#39;s why Misty wasn&#39;t interested in me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m kinda glad for that,&quot; said Beth, &quot;Otherwise, we wouldn&#39;t have met.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t disagree with that,&quot; said Lizzie, &quot;But animals have strong mating instincts. Humans are the only species who aren&#39;t so tightly bound that they can take interest in the same sex. With the occasional exception among animals. But apparently animal mating instincts are strong enough that eventually, any gay or lesbian person who becomes an Animalian will eventually become attracted to the opposite sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, does that mean we&#39;re going to fall out of love?&quot; asked Beth with some worry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, no,&quot; said Lizzie, &quot;At most, we&#39;re going to be bisexual. So there&#39;s nothing wrong with you finding male dogs attractive. I myself have been noticing the tomcats lately. But that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to stop loving each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank goodness,&quot; said Beth with a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, that&#39;s part of your present,&quot; said Lizzie before she reached under the bed and pulled out a box. She handed it to Beth and said, &quot;Go ahead. Open it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beth opened the box and her eyebrows raised. Inside were a pair of dildos. They were obviously designed for Animalians as one was shaped like a cat&#39;s dick and the other like a dog&#39;s. But what was really interesting was the leather strap thing that was included in the box. Beth took it out and asked, &quot;Is this a strap-on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; said Lizzie, &quot;It&#39;s not quite the same as having a man, but I think it&#39;ll be enough to satisfy our growing bisexuality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beth grinned and quickly shrugged out of her robe. It took a while, but she was soon wearing the strap-on. She had equipped it with the feline dildo and was having it point at Lizzie. &quot;This enough tomcat for you?&quot; asked Beth.<br />
<br />
&quot;More than enough,&quot; said Lizzie as she removed her robe and laid back. Beth aimed her dildo carefully before plunging into Lizzie. Lizzie gave a moan as the nubs on the dildo rubbed her insides. &quot;Don&#39;t work me too raw. I want to return the favor after you&#39;re fun,&quot; she purred.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look forward to it,&quot; said Beth before she started humping her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
For once, Clara and Robbie didn&#39;t have any mayoral duties to attend to. Thanks in no small part to Animalia&#39;s new Public Relations Media Department (or PR-MD). The two of them were wanting to celebrate with their respective spouses so they went over to Clara and Rick&#39;s house for dinner. After they finished and the cubs were tucked in bed, they went to one of the few luxuries that the first family owned: an indoor hot tub. Clara was glad they hadn&#39;t gone for an outdoor one as it would be frozen up by now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s to the PR-MD, one of Animalia&#39;s best ideas,&quot; said Clara, raising her wineglass not for the first time. While Animalians were not normally drinkers, Clara really wanted to cut loose and feel tipsy for once. And she seemed to be succeeding.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still why we didn&#39;t think of that in the first place,&quot; said Robbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you guys were short of staff at first,&quot; said Martha, &quot;Not enough people to foist responsibility on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, you both care for Animalia so much that you want to devote as much effort into make sure it was okay,&quot; said Rick, &quot;That&#39;s not anything to be ashamed about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t care about Animalia tonight,&quot; said Clara before yanking off her bikini top, &quot;Tonight it&#39;s just me and the two men I love. Rob, Dick, get over here and show your favorite pussy some affection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem,&quot; said Martha a bit forcibly, &quot;Robert is <i>my</i> husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be such a prude, Martha,&quot; said Clara, &quot;Dick, you got permishion to tap that vixen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha turned to Rick with a raised eyebrow. &quot;Ok, I think someone&#39;s drunk enough for one night,&quot; said Rick, &quot;Clara, I think it&#39;s time for bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, kitty want fun,&quot; said Clara, scooting over to Rick and sitting in his lap, &quot;Kitty wants her dick.&quot; She started pawing at Rick&#39;s shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clara, we have company,&quot; said Rick with alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, let them watch,&quot; said Clara before lifting her rear out of the water. &quot;Betcha mish this big ash,&quot; she said, waving her butt at Robbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she always like this when she&#39;s drunk?&quot; asked Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s never gotten this drunk before, to my knowledge,&quot; said Rick, &quot;I guess she&#39;s been feeling more pressure and tension from her job than- Clara!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops, silly me,&quot; said Clara, having slipped off his bikini bottom, &quot;Now it&#39;s your turn.&quot; With that, she plunged forward and Rick yelped as she released his dick from its restraints.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is getting a bit awkward,&quot; said Martha as the two pumas started splashing, Rick trying to push Clara off.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a bit hot though,&quot; admitted Robbie.<br />
<br />
Martha sighed and said, &quot;You want to mate right now, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Robbie. He yelped a bit as Martha reached over to touch his crotch and confirm he was fully erect. &quot;Maybe a little,&quot; he admitted.<br />
<br />
Martha rolled her eyes and called, &quot;Rick, might as well let our bond-mates have what they want. They&#39;re just animals, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t I know it,&quot; said Rick as his wife plunged forward again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha, you don&#39;t have to-&quot; started Robbie before Martha sat on his lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be doing it later tonight anyways. Why not now?&quot; asked Martha as she pulled off her top.<br />
<br />
Robbie shrugged as he went for his shorts. &quot;Clara&#39;s on the pill, right?&quot; he called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, though she&#39;s going to have an awful headache next morning,&quot; said Rick as his wife mewed and rode him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, that&#39;s all I need to know,&quot; said Robbie. Martha soon gave a yip as he entered her. Not exactly the most professional image for the mayor and deputy mayor of Animalia, but it couldn&#39;t be denied that they had some tension to work off.</p>
