<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kendra sat at her desk trying to pay attention to the lesson wen a familiar itch began to impede her efforts. She knew what was happening she had forgotten to drink her &quot;medicine&quot; that morning and now she was feeling her body beginning to change. Kendra knew that if she waited much longer she would start to transform in front of everyone at school and given what she tried to do to her sister the last time she changed it definitely wouldn&#39;t end well. she needed to get home as soon as possible maybe she could convince the teacher that she was feeling sick. Kendra began to cough trying to make it sound as horrible and as convincing as possible fortunately it didn&#39;t take long for the teacher to notice. <br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a nasty cough are you feeling okay Kendra&quot;?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t feel very good I think I need to go home&quot;.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take much convincing as Kendra&#39;s skin had started to go pale making her look fairly sick, upon seeing her the teacher immediately sent her home. Relieved Kendra quickly grabbed her tings and waked out of school. Fortunately her house wasn&#39;t very far it only took a few minutes to get form one to the other. The problem was her legs with every step she could feel them getting weaker and weaker it wouldn&#39;t be long now. As she hurried home Kendra began to think back to wen this all started the day she was cursed.<br />
<br />
It all started on her 18th birthday she was in the back yard wen she found an unusual snake. Kendra always kind of liked snakes and was familiar with most of them in the area but she had never seen one like this before. It looked like a cobra with iridescent black scales and a golden eye on the hood. The moment it saw her it lunged for her biting her on the arm and injected her with its venom. Horrified Kendra screamed running inside to tell her mother who immediately went to the phone. She was just about to call an ambulance wen Kendra began to convulse and change she watched in horror as her body began to fall apart her skin was coming off and her legs were falling off. In only a few moments Kendra was laying on the floor her legs now replaced with a massive snake tail and the floor was covered with her discarded skin and legs. Upon seeing what was happening to her daughter Kendra&#39;s mom immediately abandoned her call to the hospital and called someone else... the local witch. <br />
<br />
Her name was Jasmine and she was often considered to be insane by most of the people in town all except Kendra&#39;s mom who had been her best friend for years. Kendra and her sister Lily both liked her she was always fun to talk to even tho she was a bit perverted at times and Kendra sometimes wondered if their wasn&#39;t more going on between her and mom. Eventually Jasmine arrived with some of her supplies and a worried look on her face and immediately began to examine Kendra. It took a few hours and a number of rituals wen she finally came to the conclusion that she was cursed to be a lamea buy someone intentionally but couldn&#39;t identify who. She also warned her that if someone was exposed to ether her venom or sexual fluids they could become cursed as well. Unfortunately she couldn&#39;t undo the curse completely she was however able to create a potion that could temporarily reverse the affects allowing Kendra to be human again and stay human as long as she takes it once a day. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t a perfect solution tho Kendra sometimes forgot to take it mostly during the weekend. Last Saturday was no exception that day Kendra was feeling a little hot and bothered and at the time she was hanging out with Lily in the living room. Suddenly she felt herself starting to change causing her arousal to sky rocket and she could no longer resist. Lily was in shock watching as her sister striped naked and started to masturbate right in front of her all while she was transforming into a lamia. Worried for her sister Lily tried to get Kendra to snap out of it only for her to pin Lily down and start to strip off her cloths as she began to teas her sister&#39;s body. But before Kendra could go any further she was grabbed form behind buy Jasmine who had to force a potion down her throat. After finally calming down Kendra went to her sister and apologized giving her a huge before going to her room for the rest of the day feeling a bit like a monster. <br />
<br />
Now Kendra was racing to get home her transformation was almost in full force her skin was starting to peal, two of her teeth were coming louse, and her legs were getting weaker with every step. Her house was in view now she only had little ways to go but will she make it in time?</p>
