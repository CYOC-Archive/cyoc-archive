<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well I suppose we can play it by ear!&quot; The Magician said as he moved Dan and Mike into another bear hug. &quot;Good boys! Now show me some brotherly love!&quot; &quot;Kay!!&quot; The two did as asked and tongued each other. Of course, this wasn&#39;t brotherly at all, but they had been conditioned to believe otherwise. While they did the Magician moved their arms and kept their legs hugging each other. He moved them to each other&#39;s penises and gave each other hand jobs. &quot;Mmm!!&quot; The two boys felt a surge from their respective privates. Mike was still too young, but Dan&#39;s stood at full attention. As they continued their obscene ritual, the Magician hit them with another spell to make them poop and pee. &quot;Mmm!!&quot; The two simply let nature take its course as they defiled each other with their urine. An extra jerk hit Dan&#39;s penis and he ejaculated as well. The Magician took them off each other. &quot;Bwahh!!&quot; &quot;How was that?&quot; the Magician asked. &quot;That was so cool!&quot; Mike said. &quot;Yeah! I really liked it!&quot; &quot;Good, good!&quot; The Magician brought them to the shower again. This time, he pulled Dan&#39;s pelvis up to Mike&#39;s head and placed his penis in his mouth, Dan&#39;s legs wrapped around. They took another shower and then were brought back into the room, this time with Mike in Dan&#39;s position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, can you boys suck on your own wieners this time?&quot; &quot;Let me see!&quot; Dan said as he tried to get his mouth around his pee-pee. &quot;Ugh...Ugh... I can&#39;t do it!&quot; he said. &quot;Me neither Daddy! What do we do?!&quot; &quot;No problem then. Bodus Stretchus!&quot; The Magician hit them with another spell. &quot;Now try again.&quot; &quot;Okay! Woah! Dan felt his upper boy stretch out as he easily got his mouth onto his wiener. &quot;Mmm...&quot; &quot;Cool!&quot; Mike did the same. &quot;Good! Good!&quot; The Magician made them pee in their own mouths this time. Then he took them off each other and stretched out their legs, allowing them to grabbed their own penises by their toes. &quot;Oh, ha, ah!!&quot; They both let out small moans as they jerked themselves off with their feet. &quot;Good! Good!&quot; &quot;Woah!!&quot; The magician then stretched their pelvises from their upper body, brought it around their backs and brought their butts over their heads. Another loose bowel spell and their were shitting all over their heads. Their legs stretched out even more and their toes found their way into each others mouths. They sucked on each toe. Moving their bodies back to normal, the magician stretched their penises out and under them. &quot;Erectus!&quot; Another spell and their penises shot up erect, even though for Mike that shouldn&#39;t have been possible. They were enlarged to an adult size and stuck into their asses. &quot;Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh!!&quot; The two brothers moaned as they were penetrated by their own wieners. The Magician put them closer as they kissed each other. &quot;Mm,mm,mm,mm!!&quot; they muffled as their dicks started to shake and cum. &quot;Mmmmmggghhhhh!!&quot; <br />
<br />
With that done, the Magician turned their bodies back to normal. &quot;And how was that?&quot; &quot;So... So good...&quot; Mike moaned out. &quot;Oh yeah. I want more!&quot; Dan shouted out of breath. &quot;Now you can&#39;t waste too much of a good thing,&quot; the Magician replied back as they brother them back into the shower. Mike was turned upside down and was hugged by Dan with his penis in his mouth. Dan was bent down a little and given Mike&#39;s penis in return. They sucked out the leftover jizz an were showered once more. They were brought back in with Mike and Dan&#39;s previous positions switched. &quot;Now who wants more stretching time!&quot; &quot;Yay!!&quot; The Magician continued to experiment with his stretching magic. So many positions were tried, exhausting the two boys. &quot;I think that&#39;s enough for today!&quot; the Magician said as they sat for dinner. Mike and Dan were still naked, but they enjoyed the scrambled eggs their father made all the same. Pulled again, this time in a simple bear hug, the Magician brought them back into their rooms for the night, still naked and left them there that way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Today was so much fun, wasn&#39;t it Mikey!&quot; Dan asked as he played with Mike&#39;s pee-pee. Still being naked, he couldn&#39;t help touching it. &quot;It was! Daddy&#39;s so cool. He can do anything!&quot; Mike was doing the same to Dan of course. &quot;Yeah, he can. Daddy&#39;s so cool...&quot; Dan said looking intently at Mike&#39;s little member. &quot;Something wrong?&quot; Mike asked. &quot;Oh no... Its just... I feel weird touching this. Not that I hate it or anything. It feels so nice, but...&quot; &quot;You think it should be bigger?&quot; &quot;Oh yeah... How do you know?&quot; &quot;Cause I was thinkin&#39; the same thing about you. &quot;Yours should be biggerer.&quot; &quot;Wow... You know...&quot; Dan said taking his hands off. &quot;I had this dream last night where I was an adult and you were a teen. And I called you my son too.&quot; &quot;Really?! Cause I had a dream where I was a teen and you were an adult. And... And I called you Dad!&quot; &quot;No way... That&#39;s so weird!&quot; Dan and Mike just stared at each other. &quot;Dad...&quot; Mike said. &quot;Son... Dan replied. &quot;...Nope! Don&#39;t feel anything!&quot; Mike said. &quot;Me neither! But it was just a dream! Probably doesn&#39;t mean anything!&quot; &quot;I guess...Well good night Daddy! Sorry! I mean Danny!&quot; &quot;Yeah good night Mikey my boy! I mean my bro!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike had a dream. In it he was staring at a mass of something. In the last dream he was a teenager, but now he was the kid he looked like now. The mass started to shrink. The cause of it was a man Mike was now calling his father. The mass returned to its former shape, the adult Mike in the dream had called Dad. &quot;You... You Motherfucker! When I get out of this, you&#39;re a dead man!&quot; the dream dad yelled at the real life dad. &quot;I see you are as foulmouthed as ever. And you&#39;re setting such a bad example for your baby boy!&quot; Mike&#39;s real life father replied back. He looked so scary to Mike. &quot;Daddy! Dad!&quot; Mike called out to the dream dad. The magician and the dream dad were talking. It was hard to hear what was being said. Eventually Mike&#39;s real life father hit the dream Dad with a spell and he started to shrink. No, it was more like he was getting younger. Soon he stopped regressing in age. When Mike stared back at him, what shown in his eyes was a young boy. His big brother, Dan! And then Darkness! &quot;Ahh!&quot; Mike woke up in shock. &quot;Mmgh...&quot; Dan woke up in return still sleepy. &quot;Daddy! Danny, I had another dream!&quot; &quot;Oh... me too. I... I couldn&#39;t see anything, but then I could and what was staring back at me was you even though there was a teen there before.&quot; &quot;Me too, but then Daddy hit dream Daddy with magic and then.. then he was you.&quot; Dan didn&#39;t know what to say. The fact that hey had similar dream was so strange. &quot;Well there&#39;s nothing we can do for now. Let&#39;s just get back to sleep.&quot; Dan said as he did just that. Mike soon followed after. He looked down at his body one more time. &quot;It feels like it should be bigger though...&quot; And went to sleep.</p>
