<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Before you do anything else, you decide to inspect the changes that occurred to you more thoroughly. Slowly, you get up from your bed and almost fall over. Damn. You didn&#39;t really think about how your equilibrium would change with the difference in height and weight. You start walking over to your bathroom slowly, always making sure to look at your bare feet. Whereas before they had been long, callused, and tan, now they were small and thin. The toes were painted with a light blue polish. You hold up one of your hands, seeing that your fingernails are  the same color. As with your feet, your fingers are smaller and thinner, with your hand being softer and paler than you remember. <br />
    After entering the bathroom, you put your hands on the sink, and look up at your face. Your face is still pretty boyish, like you remember it. Your hair has transitioned from its original red to a softer, prettier strawberry blonde color. It has grown slightly and become a slightly longer pixie cut, which you don&#39;t really like that much. Your nose, a roman style before, has shrunk and become a smaller, more rounded and feminine type. Your eyes seem slightly larger, the lashes are longer and as you inspect them closer, you see that your eye color has gone from a pale blue to a muddled sort of green. You still have a masculine chine and facial structure, and your face looks starved, unlike before when it had seemed chiseled. You have to work on that, you couldn&#39;t handle to stare at a face this ugly for very long, not when you have the ability to change it.<br />
   And now, it&#39;s time to inspect your &quot;goods&quot;. You pull your tee-shirt over your shoulders, revealing your small breasts. Turns out you were right about you not wearing a bra. You rub the breast slowly, massaging, hoping to garner a response. The feeling you get is... less than what you expected. Based on the results you got when you massaged your various girlfriends&#39; chests, you thought it would have a better result. Maybe if you had larger breasts? You grab the flashlight, and twist the light to medium and shine it on your chest briefly. Your breasts expand quickly, the nipples lengthening and areolas expanding. Something appears next to your discarded shirt. You pick it up, and find out it&#39;s a bra. Looking at the label, you see that your breasts have expanded to a B-cup. Interesting. It seems in this altered reality, you wore a bra today because of your larger breasts. You rub your breasts again, and while the stimulation is greater, you still think that they could be larger, leading to greater pleasure. You turn the light to high brightness, and shine it on your chest, making sure not to make your breasts too large. You don&#39;t want them to encumber you. <br />
    Looking at the bra again, you see that the label has changed, as well as the size. Looking at the label, you see that it is now a C-cup. You grope your breast, massaging it, and the feeling is amazing. Compared to when you were an A and B cup, your breasts have increased in sensitivity. You massage them in front of the mirror for a few minutes, letting out low moans as you slowly grope yourself, imagining your girlfriend sucking them, licking and kneading them like dough. After around ten minutes, you feel satisfied, and are happy with your breasts&#39; size and sensitivity. You anticipate seeing your girlfriend and having her play with them. <br />
      Before you continue down to your vagina and legs, you decide to fix your face quickly. First, you set the light to medium brightness and shine it along your lower face, hoping to get rid of that boyish chin and facial structure that makes you look like a man. It&#39;s not that you want to be a girl, you just don&#39;t want to be ugly, you know? It&#39;s nicer to be seeing a pretty face in the reflection. After you switch the light off, you look into the mirror to see your reflection. You have acquired some fat on your face. However, it doesn&#39;t make you look pudgy, instead adding a sort of cute lovability to your previously gaunt features. Your previously granite jaw has receded somewhat, making your face rounder and softer, making you look more girlish. Your facial structure now makes you look like more of a cute or hot girl, but your pixie cut and small eyes detract from that. You shine the medium light on your eyes and upper head, and your eyes sting for a moment, before you open them, seeing that they have grown larger, and the lashes have grown out. Your greenish brown eyes now match perfectly against your somewhat pale, clean skin and give you an earthy glow. You shine the medium light on the back of your head and watch it grow down to your shoulders through the mirror, straightening and softening against your skin. It gains volume and grows, making you look prettier than before. Although you are most definitely not hot, you are incredibly cute, which was what you were looking for. You smile, but notice that it doesn&#39;t seem to fit your face, and you realize that your thin lips and overly large smile are remnants from your previously male face. You shine the medium light along your lips, feeling them plumpen somewhat and become a light red, nearly pink. You smile and your teeth grow smaller and fit your mouth, and you smile, making your face glow. If your were still a guy, you would be attracted to the face in the mirror.<br />
      Unnoticed by you, makeup kits and mascara brushes appear on your sink, along with a little kit. Although no makeup applies itself to your face, due to the fact that it&#39;s around one in the morning, a small wipe appears on the sink, Light mascara smudges and blush appear to have been wiped on it.<br />
    You stare at the work you&#39;ve done for a moment. Staring at you is the face of an extremely cute girl, her shoulder length strawberry-blonde hair framing her soft face with large eyes. Below that, her pale, thin shoulders, and below that, massive, round breasts, hanging down upon a thin waste. However, below there, you see thin hips and boyish thighs. Slowly, you undo your pants and slide them down below your legs, until they are completely off. You stare for a moment at your unshaven legs, and quickly strip off the cotton panties shielding your vagina. Your pussy is now bare to the world. You prod it, feeling for your clitoris. Slowly you start to work yourself into a frenzy, moaning quietly, hoping not to wake your mothers. You are shocked by the incredible sexual feeling, as it is ten times masturbating as a man. In an effort to make your pleasure greater, you shine the light on your vagina, and the pubic hair thins, dwindling until it becomes clean shaven. The lips plump, and your vagina is instantly more sensitive. You stick your hand in again, and you shudder as sexual feelings overwhelm you. However, you remind yourself of your goal. You&#39;re cleaning yourself up. Making yourself more desirable. You shine the light over your legs, watching as the hair begins to shave itself, almost, the thighs thickening and tanning slightly, while still being pale. You end off at your feet, and watch as they shrink slightly, and the nail polish goes from blue to pink. Unnoticed by yourself, the same happens on your hands.<br />
     You do a quick spin in the mirror, and you are satisfied by your legs and vagina. You turn your attention to your hips. You shine the light on your hips, watching them widen, your ass extending outward. You reach one hand out to squeeze it, feeling the plumpness and softness of it. Thoroughly aroused, you think of your girlfriend, and the hot lesbian sex you will be having as soon as you see her. You smile to yourself, and after giving yourself a once over, decide that your female body is now irresistible. Slowly picking up your clothes, you leave the bathroom and saunter back into your room, your hips swaying. You turn on the light, and survey the changes. Not much has changed, but your closet seems bigger, and your phone case seems to have become pink. Your gaming laptop is still on the desk, and all but one of your posters have remained the same. Whereas before there had been a picture of Call of Duty, now there is one of One Direction. You don&#39;t feel attracted to them, but as you think about their music, it sounds nicer in your head now. You turn the light back off and climb into bed, feeling the covers rubbing against your sensitive nipples. You go to sleep with the flashlight on the table, waiting for what tomorrow will bring.</p>
