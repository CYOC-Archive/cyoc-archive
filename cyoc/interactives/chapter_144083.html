<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Much of the Lunar New Year was something that really played more to those of Asian ancestry, and primarily from Japan and China. For the members of Animalia Ambassadoria, this celebration was very much a new thing that came about after Animalia formed and gained some means of contact between the people of Lyre and the outside world. This soon included some other parts of the celebration that soon gained some attraction to some of those that were in Animalia for the Lunar New Year Celebration and recognized some of the Animalia Ambassadoria members that were present.<br />
<br />
&quot;This would be a lot more fun if it wasn&#39;t so cold at night,&quot; JC said to Sophie and Roland as he and Pauline were with the two Pterodactylus Dinotopians and enjoying some of the fireworks that were set off to welcome the &quot;new year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s hard to see fireworks in the day,&quot; Sophie managed a shrug, &quot;and in this part of the country... we really can&#39;t expect spring weather until closer to mid-March. We&#39;re far enough north that we will not only get winter weather, but it will stick with us for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roland slowly nodded and the four of them all shivered a little bit while bundled up in heavy winter jackets. JC and Pauline both periodically scratched as the heavy jackets put a lot of pressure on their feathers and that likely made them itch a little. However, none of them could really avoid the issue as in the Jurassic Period, when Pterodactylus lived in Germany or the early Cretaceous when Microraptor lived in China global temperatures were much warmer, and the specific climates the two species lived in were much warmer. Some Dinosaurs may have lived in colder temperatures and saw snow on a regular basis during certain portions of the year, but Microraptor wasn&#39;t one of them, and among Pterosaurs, neither was Pterodactylus.<br />
<br />
&quot;And they do may for a spectacular show and display,&quot; came a new voice from behind them as another set of fireworks went off overhead in brilliant colors and flashing lights. They then turned to see a lone Red Crowned Crane Animalian, Maho Yurikazi, standing there politely. Like them she was in a warm winter coat, but she seemed to better tolerate some of the late winter cold a bit better.<br />
<br />
&quot;They do... but before I was uplifted to become a Microraptor Dinotopian, I was mostly inside in a well heated room,&quot; JC spoke with Pauline nodding in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Microraptor...&quot; Maho slowly mused.<br />
<br />
&quot;A small Theropod from China,&quot; Sophie explained, &quot;Though from a different part from China than Velociraptor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They would be related though... with &quot;raptor&quot; in the name?&quot; Maho wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Distantly,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;both would be considered Dromaeosaurs but Microraptor is smaller and more of a tree dweller while Velociraptor was probably slightly larger and more ground dwelling... and lacking Microraptor&#39;s four wings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they don&#39;t do much for warmth,&quot; Pauline commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to be strong,&quot; Maho actually laughed, &quot;given the stories of Dinosaur and Pterosaur bones being found and labelled as &quot;dragon bones&quot; in traditional Chinese culture... you four might find yourselves in some of the contests connected with Animalia&#39;s celebrations for the Chinese New Year.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four gave a small shrug with Roland glancing to Sophie and then to JC. Some of the &quot;dragon bones&quot; reference he understood, but he really wasn&#39;t good enough with the Chinese Zodiac to know what &quot;year&quot; it was without some outside guide.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Abby and Samson went along to follow the Mister and Miss Zodiac 2019 Competition, partially to be there for some of the pigs that had been part of the Brown Farm in the initial outbreak. Back then, the Browns had raised a small number of pigs for some means of food providing manure that would then be sold to companies that used them to make fertilizer. It wasn&#39;t something as big as other things that had been done on the Brown farm, but just as with other things, the Animalia Virus had led to many changes, and both Abby and Samson had heard from some of the uplifted pigs on how they were a bit disheartened at learning on how so many humans seemed to think they were filthy and lazy animals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for coming to support me,&quot; said one of the Brown farm&#39;s former boars, whom Abby had named &quot;Charlie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a friend, Charlie,&quot; Abby said to him with a small smile, &quot;we&#39;ll always be there for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And while you may not have won,&quot; Samson admitted, &quot;You did a good job. I&#39;m not sure Paul is that much stronger than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie nodded and looked over stage where Paul and Olive were discussing something with Beth and Luke. Some of it likely to relate on what they&#39;d be expected to do the next year when the competition was held again. In some ways Charlie got along quite well and even worked out together when they weren&#39;t working at their respective jobs. Charlie found Paul to be fairly polite, but there were some times where it was more like he accepted his conversion more than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... he might give you a real challenge in the IAC this summer, Samson,&quot; Charlie warned with a chuckle, &quot;he&#39;s got abs of steel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If he wants it... he can win it,&quot; Samson answered, &quot;It&#39;d be fair to let him have turn as the winner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not competing?&quot; Charlie wondered with a surprised look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not this summer,&quot; Samson answered with a nod, &quot;I&#39;ll probably be busy with work or rooting for Abby in anything she decides to compete in.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Sarah, Travis, Malice, and Simon were also there for the competition, though some of that was more to talk to Beth. Simon was also technically there because Luke was there as well. They had to wait a little bit while Beth discussed some things with Olive. The converted Doberman gave a small chuckle as she saw them approach the stairway on the edge of the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;This might be the first time someone&#39;s come to see someone that wasn&#39;t part of the contest,&quot; Beth gave a slightly teasing voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;We did come to see the competition, too,&quot; Travis answered, &quot;their boars looked remarkably strong...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really makes one wonder as to why people got the notion that pigs are just fat and lazy,&quot; Sarah commented in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably stereotypes for animals, I guess,&quot; Beth shrugged, &quot;Something up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly just some curiosity on what it&#39;s like at college,&quot; said Malice, &quot;anything interesting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s academically harder than High School,&quot; Beth answered, &quot;but there&#39;s also been plenty of other activities that can be fun and challenging. And PET does sponsor a few of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; Malice asked with curiosity and soon a wagging tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are some various races and other competitions that will go around the campus,&quot; Beth commented, &quot;Some will include some basic puzzle solving for a prize. What kind of prize usually varies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are the prizes?&quot; Malice asked with interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;That you&#39;ll have to wait and see,&quot; Beth game a small smile, which drew a groan from Malice. After that she continued, &quot;anyway... unless you have some other burning question... I&#39;ll be heading give Eliza a quick hello before I gotta get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going back?&quot; Travis asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Beth nodded, &quot;the college isn&#39;t going to drop its schedule because I won the Year of the Dog competition last year. It&#39;s a hustle, but one of those things everyone goes through, I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice sighed and then nodded, remembering having to go without Simon for the previous school year while he was at the police academy. She had her ideas to do the same, though for the moment, with her curiosity raised, she also figured she could get a general degree first and then go through the police academy. It would save her the special training assignments that Simon had to take until he was legally old enough to get his badge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you&#39;ll say hello to her for us?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
Beth slowly nodded.<br />
<br />

<br />
Jessica and Roger had much of their tour with many of the events that were put on for Chinese New Year being relation to some of the Martial Arts events and the Sumo Wrestling contest that had been put on as part of the New Year Celebrations. Jessica had come to expect it given who Roger&#39;s brother was, but it had gone well and Jessica was happy to have him with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for coming with me,&quot; Roger said to Jessica, &quot;I know all the martial arts stuff isn&#39;t necessarily your thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I came because you came,&quot; Jessica answered, &quot;If they have a year of the rabbit and they do a martial arts thing... you could show what you&#39;ve learned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be something more of a beginner&#39;s class,&quot; Roger admitted, &quot;I&#39;ll never be as strong or as skilled as the elements are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You never know,&quot; Jessica offered.<br />
<br />
Roger only shrugged as the snow crunched a bit under their furry feat. It wasn&#39;t super deep at present but then the sidewalk had also been shoveled and it was otherwise cold enough that the snow wouldn&#39;t just melt. After a few moments, he hesitantly put an arm around Jessica&#39;s shoulder, and he happily smiled as she moved closer to him as they walked along. For, while he did have some interest in the martial arts, a lot of that was less important to him than Jessica. The fact that she was willing to go see some of the martial arts expo just made it better.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve done fairly well with the lessons you and your brother have taken,&quot; Jessica told him, &quot;and I am pleased with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re only saying that because it&#39;s just after Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; Roger teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh there are plenty of things that I may want to do because its close to Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; Jessica answered, knowing full well that she&#39;d been wrestling with all the rising hormones that related to both her conversion and puberty as well. <br />
<br />
The addition of the Mountain Cottontail&#39;s early year breeding season, February to July, was also there added to all of that with regard to Roger. He might be a domestic rabbit, though his former owners never knew the specific breed, but to Jessica, he was handsome and got more so with every day. And Jessica knew she wanted him, but she also knew that she wished to maintain control and let any &quot;first time&quot; be a romantic moment and not something that was almost purely driven high hormone levels related to either conversion or being double dosed as it had been for Abby, Sarah, Malice, and Pauline. Nor did she want it to be the result of an accidental discovery of an erogenous zone triggering heavy arousal as it had for Sophie. Though, with some of her lessons from Shyra, that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that Jessica wouldn&#39;t tease her boyfriend from time to time, just to be playful.<br />
<br />
Roger only smiled and laughed back, &quot;I&#39;m sure...&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt much the same way as Jessica did, and his own Lapine senses could tell that biologically speaking she wasn&#39;t too far away from coming into season. But they were single dosed and she wanted to be patient. Not to mention that all the action tv shows that he and his brother had watched had also taught him to be respectful with what Jessica wanted and to always defend her.</p>
