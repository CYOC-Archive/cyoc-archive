<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake continued to drink in the smell radiating off his semen through his nostrils. He couldn&#39;t stand the smell of bodily fluids when he was human. Now, however, a single sniff made his snout feel pleasantly warm. Still, the same could not be said for his monstrous member. This actually angered and frustrated him. He was still so horny and ready to rut. He pulled at his monstrous member a few more times. His frustration grew as it only twitched in response, even sending out a small jolt of overstimulated pain. He gave an inhumanly frustrated growl, let go of himself, and continued to stare at his own strands of seed. Quiet, his gaze eventually shifted over to the lamp, laying on his clean, unsodden bed. He let his forked tongue lick his scaly nose, before trodding over to it. He was filled with a new desire and quick access to satisfy it.<br />
<br />
The scales on his clawed hand clinked heavily against the brass-like metal of the lamp as he rubbed. They practically scratched it as another cloud billowed out of the lamp and flooded the room. Once again, Beldazarr was instantly in the room with Drake. The room perhaps looked miniature with a large Djinn and dragon-man inhabiting it at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings Again, Mortal Master And Friend!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mortal...&quot; the drake hissed quietly. He would have to catalog such a thing for later.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Is Your Wish or Desire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Djinn,&quot; Drake spoke, &quot;I wish to possess my ultimate virility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What Do You Mean By &#39;ultimate virility&#39;, O Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To be able pleasure myself constantly!&quot; Drake said harshly, &quot;To never have to wait please myself sexually. To be able to sow my seed absolutely. To never experience the &#39;mortal&#39; stresses of over stimulation!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Djinn was quiet for a moment, much to the serpent&#39;s continued impatience. After a few moments, he spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;To Recapitulate In A Way In That I Can Actually Grant Such Desires, Your Desire To Possess &#39;ultimate virility&#39; Infers The Following: To Change Yourself To Pleasure Yourself As Long As You Want. To Alter Your Sexual Drives To Possess A Minimal Refractory Period. To Reform Your Genes So That They Are Always Powerful Enough To Sire Absolutely. To Remove Your Body&#39;s Need To Express Discomfort From Any Sexual Encounter. Is This What You Desire?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Drake said with impatience. The Djinn chuckled in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;O Master. These Changes Can Usually Be Done Only Individually, With Each Individual Interaction With The Lamp. However, Since You Seem To Be In A Hurry, And The Only One Currently Even Conceivable Of Using The Lamp, I Will Treat This As If You Had Fulfilled The Required Stipulations, This Once. As Long As You Wish Them So.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish it so,&quot; he said simply through his teeth to the Djinn.<br />
<br />
&quot;It Is Done.&quot; Beldazarr said, and the cloak of fog receded back into the lamp, taking the Djinn with it. <br />
<br />
As soon as he left Drake&#39;s steely gaze, Drake himself heeled over as an intense pressure attacked his lower groin and lower abdomen. A Cold, flooding feeling invaded his abdominal area, and slowly flowed downwards until it settled in his testicles. Everywhere the flood washed over inside him felt full. Similar to blue balls, Drake noted, but not painful nor as bloated. Then, the pressure evaporated all at once. He stood as soon as he was able to, and immediately felt the cold air of the room waft past his still limp member. Surprisingly timid, Drake wrapped a claw around it and gave a squeeze. Expecting to be greeted with another pang of over-stimulation, instead a jolt of pleasure shot through him. His member immediately swelled to full mast. With a wry smile of excitement, he began to stroking himself, happy and surprised at the lack of pain.<br />
<br />
As he stroked himself, he couldn&#39;t help get faster and faster. Merely moments ago he couldn&#39;t even get a response. All too soon, he felt like he reaching the edge. He let his tongue loll out of his mouth in preparation as he pumped, eagerly awaiting the feeling of an orgasm. Instead however, something unexpected happened. The only way he could describe it was if he had passed the edge, but was still climbing the rungs of pleasure. He pulled his tongue back in, but kept jacking himself. His dragon face contorted as he completely passed the level he would normally orgasm at, but still did not ejaculate. Almost blinded by the pleasure, he craned his head down and watched red-faced as his huge member twitched and throbbed more and more, looking similar to an orgasmic spasm, but without any cum exploding out of his member. It was amazing, yet torture. Briefly, Drake thought about how desperately he wanted to ejaculate right now.<br />
<br />
In that moment, his member obliged and began to shoot rope after rope. Each contraction was as powerful as the last. Moreover, if his sperm from last time was almost white, the strands that shot out  now were completely and uniformly opaque and white. He clenched his teeth and humped into both of his claws as his level of pleasure held steady at the highest peak he&#39;s ever felt before. Each time he shot out, a violent jolt of pleasure from surged from his groin to his brain. He could feel each throb, and each strand as it left him.<br />
<br />
This carried on for a considerable while. Drake had eventually let his dick go, bobbing as he continued to hump wildly into the air, launching rope after rope. Each new blast slapped audibly against the previous as it all formed either a smear on the wall, or a sizable pool on his roommate&#39;s bed.  Drake himself hunched over the bed, head tilted back. His forked tongue was once again hanging off the side of his maw, but a strand of spittle was now dripping from it. His eyes were open, but he was blinded with pleasure. Somewhere in his head, in the metaphysical tsunami of pleasure racking his mind, Drake happened to briefly think about stopping, just to see the mess he made. Immediately, his dick gave one more throb before the faucet of dragon semen that was his groin ran dry. With it, the amazingly raw, carnal pleasure disappated. As his pleasure was replaced by with afterglow, Drake expected to fall to his knees and collapse from exhaustion. Instead, he suddenly felt like he did when he started earlier. His own afterglow seeming to entice him to continue, making him once again horny and raring to go. Unused to the feeling of being absolutely ready to go at all times, Drake simply looked at the bed.<br />
<br />
The amount of his own seed that laid on the bed was truly inhuman. What hadn&#39;t soaked into the sheets pooled to the divot at the center of the bed. No more than a foot of the bed survived without being sullied by Drake. Likewise, the wall the bed was against did not fair any better. Mostly concentrated in front of him, a white smear slowed sloughed down onto the edge of the bed, further ruining it. The room was a literal chamber of his own scent, which did nothing to calm his arousal. Possessing his own aphrodisiac seemed a bit dangerous to Drake. Nevertheless, each breath sent a jolt of stimulation to his groin, and it wasn&#39;t long until his member was just as turgid as before.<br />
<br />
Drake loved his new found sexual ability. Still, he was no idiot. He couldn&#39;t consider himself an Adonis until he could claim others. He continued to soak in his own scent, almost the same way one would enjoy a beer, wondering what more he could possess.</p>
