<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh put the book down and locked his door. It was late, and tomorrow was Saturday. He’d decide what to do with it then. <br />
<br />
Josh went to sleep, ideas swirling around in his head. He could change his grades, but he already had A’s. He could make his room bigger, but he fancied this small one. He could...<br />
<br />
*BANG*<br />
<br />
Josh nearly fell out of bed. He looked out his window to see Terry hanging out of his window. He appeared drunk and his friend was waving him around by his feet and in Terry’s hand was a gun. <br />
<br />
*BANG*<br />
<br />
Terry was firing a gun off drunkenly out of his form window. Lights were turning on, and Josh could make out 911 calls. <br />
<br />
Josh shook his head. It would do no good. Terry’s father was head of security and he and his wife (who must hold an extremely high paying job) funded the university heavily, and would never allow their perfect boy to be kicked out. <br />
<br />
Josh grabbed his book as another shot went off. He turned on a light and grabbed a pencil. <br />
<br />
‘Terry is a well behaved student who dorms with me although we have separate rooms connected by a small hallway.’<br />
<br />
Josh looked out the window. Miraculously, Terry was no longer being held out of the window. In fact, no one was. Josh went to his door and opened it. There instead of the hallway of the building, he found a short hall connected to two other doors. Josh opened the central one and found the normal building, and deduced the other to hold the young man in question. <br />
<br />
Josh returned to his room. He wrote, ‘The wall between Terry and I is a one way window where I can look in perfectly. Only I can perceive this and anyone else will see it as a normal wall.”<br />
<br />
Josh blinked and he could see the other room as if it were right next to him. There sat Terry, sitting in an identical room to Josh diligently doing homework at a desk. His room was immaculate, better than Josh’s. Josh had to write more. <br />
<br />
‘Terry never wears a shirt, never in his life. He’s never cold in his upper body and actually exudes some level of heat.”<br />
<br />
With that the shirt was gone, but Josh could see but only Terry’s backside. As he continued his homework. Josh stood up and walked out of his room and into Terry’s. Terry sat there, surprisingly scraggy for his old personality. <br />
<br />
“Hey Josh what’s up,” Terry said turning towards Josh. <br />
<br />
“Nothing much,” Josh said trying to think of something on the fly. “Hey...uh...did you um...ever get those protein shakes?”<br />
<br />
“Protein shakes?” Terry asked. Obviously Terry hadn’t heard of an order, but the new Terry was kind and assumed it to be his lapse of memory. “I don’t quite remember getting them. Did I want them or something?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah um,” Josh said again pulling for straws. “Remember? Out at lunch that one time? You wanted some?”<br />
<br />
Terry thought long and hard. “No I don’t believe so...”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Josh said exiting the room. “A package was given to me.”<br />
<br />
Josh left and quickly took out his book. <br />
<br />
‘A box of protein shakes is on my desk.”<br />
<br />
A box appeared, and Josh picked it up and brought it back over. <br />
<br />
“It was just on my desk you see,” Josh explained. “And I thought that it was you that wanted to gain some muscle.”<br />
<br />
Yeet was even more confused. He hadn’t thought about that. Studies were too important. Never one to be rude, he nodded his head feigning understanding and tookthe box. Josh fled back to his room and grabbed his book. <br />
<br />
‘Whenever Terry specifically eats one of the protein shakes, he will become more muscular, attractive, and subservient to me. Everyone will think it normal. After all of the shakes have been consumed, he will be absolutely under my bidding.  He will also no longer require any sustenance, water, air or be required to excrete. He will also be capable of any action I ask of him, no matter what that task may be.’<br />
<br />
Josh closed the book to see Terry examining the box. He opened it and pulled out a premise shake. The box, being small could only hold about four more of those shakes, the change would happen quickly. <br />
<br />
“Who packages prepare protein shakes?” Terry said out loud. Josh could faintly hear him, but watched as Terry chugged the shake. He looked lost in thought before shaking his head. Apparently it tasted wonderful. Josh watched as a pimple on his cheek vanished, and saw that he could no longer see the bone on Terry’s bare skin. <br />
<br />
Terry stared at his stomach, apparently hungry for more. He grabbed another one, which oddly felt lighter and chugged it again. This time again, his hair began to glisten, he had very light muscles growing around him, and his eyes almost glowed. <br />
<br />
Terry smacked his lips. It was some of the best tasting stuff he’d ever had. Terry felt a strong urge to check up on Josh and went to his door. Josh quickly made it appear that he had been studying. Terry walked in, no shirt locking rather nice. <br />
<br />
“Hey uh Josh,” Terry asked scratching his head. “Do you need anything?”<br />
<br />
“Nooooo,” Josh said trying not to look enthused. <br />
<br />
“Ok,” Terry said looking around. “I...I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
Terry’s stomach growled at Josh and Terry profusely apologized before leaving for his room. There he gobbled up the third of five shakes. Any body hair disappeared as he set down the container. Terry appeared as if he had a slight work out routine in place with more toned muscles. Josh could swear he’d grown as well as his short appeared to be much to short on him. <br />
<br />
Without wasting time, he hungrily grabbed the last two shakes, practically throwing one of them in his mouth. Terry was almost looking like a hunk with his toned biceps, six pac, and pecs. He just needed a bit more from that last shake...<br />
<br />
A knock on the door had Terry drop the shake. And answer it. It was Terry’s friend who had previously hung him outside of their building. This time he looked well kept and stood up straight. It appeared that making Terry more behaved had adverse effects. <br />
<br />
Terry came to Josh’s door, standing in all of his handsomeness in his doorway. <br />
<br />
“Matt’s here,” Terry said. “You want to come out with us?”<br />
<br />
“Nah,” Josh said.<br />
<br />
Terry turned to leave but Josh, regretting his answer said, “Actually, I’ll come.”<br />
<br />
Josh stood up and headed out in tow of Matt and Terry. Matt was carrying some assorted items, apparently helping a friend move. As the exited the building, Matt politely asked Josh to hold the box while he started the car. <br />
<br />
“Hey could you please open the trunk?” Josh asked. “I’ll put he box in there.”<br />
<br />
Josh turned towards the trunk to see that Terry was attempting to pry open the trunk with his bare hands to no avail. Matt popped the trunk and Josh cautiously put the box in the trunk and closed it. <br />
<br />
“Walk to your seat doing a hand stand and sit upside down,” Josh said to Terry. <br />
<br />
Terry flipped over and walked to the passenger seat as if it were nothing. He opened the door with amazing balance before lying his back on the seat swinging his feet up into the air. He pulled the seatbelt over his legs and began conversation with Matt. <br />
<br />
“Terry!” Matt said surprised. “What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“Sitting down?” Terry said confused. “I’ll be fine just drive.”<br />
<br />
Matt cautiously drove. While Josh sat smiling in the backseat. He had grabbed the final shake and intended to covertly give it to Terry tonight, wherever they were going. Then he could have a portable being with similar powers to the book. He prepared ideas as Matt kept on driving.</p>
