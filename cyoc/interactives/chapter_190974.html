“Wow, slut. Those are small balls you&#39;ve got. With how horny you are for my tool, that&#39;s too little. Let&#39;s make your little buddy down there look even smaller too. Maybe even write more stuff in it.” He winked, knowing the effect it&#39;d have on me. Hairy biceps blocking my view, I waited for him to be done writing. He moved his arm away once he was done, grabbing the back of my head and forcing me to look, “How&#39;s that? Feeling it yet?”<br />
<br />

Jason Gray&#39;s testicular size:<br />
Length: 8 inches<br />
Width: 6.5 inches<br />

–<br />
<br />
My mouth was wide open, in shock by how massive of an increase it was in size. The changes didn&#39;t take much time to apply. Both my testicles were pulsing, growing with every heartbeat.<br />
<br />
Larry was looking at my crotch now, a wicked smile on his face, “Look at that lil&#39; nub. It&#39;s even more pathetic now. You better have a lot of fun with those.” He laughed loudly as he took one of my engorging balls in his... Strong, manly hand. It felt so good to have Him hold it, like He was its owner. I wanted to thank him for doing so, but from his demeanor, I knew he wasn&#39;t done. And neither were my precum factories. They were about 5 inches long, 3 inches wide maybe, when I started to feel my mind get a tiny bit foggier, except for thinking about cock. Yeah, fuck, I needed cock. Maybe Larry could help me out with his power tool. I could use some drilling...<br />
<br />
Just thinking about it made my cock throb a bit, and a surge of precum started pouring from it. I turned my head towards Larry&#39;s, who sternly interrupted me before I even had a chance to open my mouth, “Not now. Maybe after I change a few more things in here.” I made a disappointed groan, so close from the pleasure his dick could give me, but so far from it. Larry stood up before removing his pants swiftly, airing out his tree-trunk thick quads and toned calves. I was naturally looking at them, unable to look away from my landlord&#39;s amazing body. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see his monster cock, fully hard, twitching as more precum leaked from its skin-covered head. Larry was staring at the book, pensive as to what he wanted to change first. Deep down, I was hoping he&#39;d make himself even sexier, as impossible as this sounded.<br />
<br />
“How big&#39;s my package?” he growled the book sternly, “Gotta make sure I&#39;m the biggest fucker around.” Text on the page shifted, filling in with more information.<br />
<br />

Larry Douglas&#39;s penile size:<br />
Flaccid Length: 10 inches<br />
Flaccid Girth: 7 inches<br />

Erect Girth: 9 inches<br />

Larry Douglas&#39;s testicular size:<br />
Length: 3.6 inches<br />
Width: 2.4 inches<br />

<br />
A frown quickly showed up on Larry&#39;s face. “Is some- Is something the matter Sir?” I weakly asked. The way he looked, I couldn&#39;t help but feel he wasn&#39;t happy by what was on the paper.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but it&#39;s just a quick fix,” he replied, striking text on the page and replacing more of it. He was going at it for quite some time, my view blocked by his wide arm. Waiting on him to be done with the book, I went over to my freshly enlarged balls. Groping them felt so amazing, my short cock quickly got hard. Fuck, it felt so good... They were so sensitive, it was even better than jerking off my useless nub. Precum kept pouring out of my dick, and I couldn&#39;t help bring some if it to my mouth. Two of my fingers went against my tongue, the taste less delicious than Larry&#39;s, but still pretty good. One of my hands was still fondling my massive balls, which were covered in my warm, sticky liquid, causing more of it to spill over me. Still being close to Larry&#39;s armpit, I couldn&#39;t but help but take a big whiff. His smell was so good, it made me feel so comfortable, like he was going to take care of me well, maybe even force me to suck him off... I wouldn&#39;t mind getting to play with his monster more... Maybe I should ask him to use the book to grow my ass, so I could wiggle it in front of him and get him horny enough to fuck me.<br />
<br />
A tap on my balls brought my attention back to Larry. “Ah!” I yelped out. Fuck, that hurt so good. Before I had time to close my mouth, he&#39;d put his index in it. “Suck it. You&#39;ll need all the practice you can get before the real thing,” he laughed. Moving my tongue around his index was showing him how easy it was to control me, I was loving every moment of it. Lost in submission, the only thing that came to mind was admiring him. His hands were thick, rough from all the callouses. His forearms, covered in manly hair and large veins. His biceps, fucking massive and ridiculously strong. <br />
<br />
My cum factories started pulsating, sending shockwaves of pleasure through my entire body. I didn&#39;t know how long it would take to unload all that sperm. Larry shoved another finger in my mouth, as if to order me to focus on my humiliation rather that my orgasm. It was so difficult to concentrate on licking his fingers. Being my first orgasm with my new balls, I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. Cum started gushing out of my nub in spurts, not even getting any air time. Each spurt lasted over 10 seconds each, making it harder to think back on obeying Larry. He was laughing the entire time, definitely aware of my situation. Emptying my balls was taking a while, would it be like that every time? Part of me wanted it to, but the other found it too messy to be worth it. There was thick cum all over my nub and balls, making them all super sticky. It didn&#39;t take a long time before I realized the floor was sticky as well... And so was the chair I was in. This felt so embarrassing... It looked like there as at least a gallon and a half of cum near me. It smelt like it too. I scooped some in my hand and brought it to my mouth, which Larry had freed after I&#39;d stopped cumming. Slurping my cum was so delicious, I&#39;d totally have to clean the chair and the floor with my face later.</p>
