<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">writhing around in desperation as he was unable to move due to her spell that Chad screams in muffles. &quot;Now then, what shall I do with you? I could turn you into a fairy slave, but that would be to easy. hmmm, maybe a baby dragon, but then, who&#39;ll take care of you till then when your older?&quot; She said, striding up to Chad and grasping him by the neck with one hand, while magical energy formed in her other hand.<br />
<br />
thinking about it as she wanted to turn Chad into something that an idea suddenly came to her like a bolt of lightning that She said it enthusiastically while gleaming magic protruded from her new dainty fingers. &quot;I got it! I know just what to make of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
hearing what she was going to turn him into scared Chad as he struggled to break free while continuing to scream out in muffled, but in shouts. Lisara wasted no time with her spell and cast a glowing energy ball at his gut, this did made Chad feel like he was hit by a wrecking ball as he immediately trembled down and fall down in a dazed with confusion that he didn&#39;t know what was going to be happening to his body. his body seems to be covered with its rumbling yellow madness that Chad suddenly felt himself shrinking.<br />
<br />
as his clothes seemed to become larger that It was slow at first as he didn&#39;t really notice it, but soon he did when his body began to morph into something which wasn&#39;t human. his muscles shrunk alongside his body, causing him to become weak while being covered in both fur and feathers. he felt his dick shrink into utter nothingness as he soon  let out a quick girlish, feminine shriek. wings sprouted from Chad&#39;s back that Chad found himself able to talk and move again when she breathed a cloud of magical purple dust on him, causing the pile of empty clothes to disappear from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change me back now!&quot; he screeched, before collapsing when he rushed to Lisara while blacking out cold that it was some time later As he looked around now. he tried to regain his focus as the world seemed to be larger, mush larger. moments later, his vision cleared up as he could now see Lisara, but she was towering over him that he also found himself in a box cage.<br />
<br />
&quot;ah, your finally awake. good, your Almost done.&quot; Lisara said, sounding almost not pleased with herself that Chad on the other hand was confused. &quot;Huh? what are you talking about?&quot; Chad said while raising his hand up, but instead was a claw talon that he then suddenly paused when he heard the sound of his voice as it sounded like a little girl, and his hand.<br />
<br />
immediately, Chad frantically looked himself over to find fur mostly everywhere on him, as well as feathers that he had matching pairs of wings. Chad looked at his hands to find talons instead as his feet were now two adorable 4 digit paws that when he looked between his legs to see his masculinity man hood was no more made him freak out as he saw his, her new tail. where Chad once stood as Chad still had thumbs, as dew claws that Despite the slightly relieving fact of being an infant is where she saw Lisara and backed up against the corner of the room while holding her tail in front of her body to hide her nakedness.<br />
<br />
realizing what Chad was as it was Moments later when a small bladder let loose out in fear that soon the floor around her was covered in a small puddle of piss. blushing hard red at this, Chad was bawling while crying until Lisara sighed and released him, letting him out of his cage before snapped her fingers. Suddenly Chad’s puddle was gone that with tears in her eyes, Chad saw how humiliating this whole situation was for her and looked up at Lisara and sniffled while sobbing. &quot;get away from me! let me go you big meanie! your nothing but a big bully!&quot;<br />
<br />
this took Lisara by shook as the sorceress&#39;s head and heart were hurt that she then slowly walked over to Chad, knelt down to Chad&#39;s level, and held out her hand to the newly young beast. &quot;I’m not a big meanie or a bully, but you seem to be lost and afraid as a young child in your situation. You know as much as I do that you can’t survive very long for what you are now.&quot; she said as to calmly ease his ego.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don’t cawe! I would raether be this then be your slave! You took Bwad! I want him back! You made me a baby girw! Why did you do thith to uth?!&quot; Chad bawled while throwing a tantrum where she sat, unable to flap her wings off the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Odd, usually one would desire to experience childhood again, let along be something their not. Such as you are doing now. No dignity, no regret, no responsibility, just harmless, adorable fun.&quot; Lisara said that this made Chad pauses as she then sniffled again and looked to Lisara about having second thoughts when she asked about brad. &quot;What about Bwad?”<br />
<br />
&quot;He’s perfectly fine, for now. now now c’mon youngster, before you make scene. You’re far too young to be wondering around without a mother anyways.&quot; Lisara said that wanting to escape he was fly away for a moment, before snapping her fingers as the was causing Chad to be dragged back to her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;i I will not harm you as you must be punished! i as said, ou’re far too young to be wondering around without a mother.&quot; she said that once again, she then clicked her fingers together and Chad felt a sudden impulse when the word mother came to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;mother?&quot; Chad asked and was then lifted up into Lisara’s arms. this made Chad&#39;s new womanly features slightly more enhanced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why of course my dear. in fact, I myself shall be your new mother and take care of you that you were once an idiotic man, weren&#39;t you?&quot; she said that with a red blush, Chad nodded as he didn&#39;t know why he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mother.&quot; Chad replied as he soon found it hard as he was lacking to fight back his newfound urges. with a snap of her fingers by mistake, he was now once again ageing, but instead of getting younger that he was getting older as he was now a proud and nobble beast. ready to fly his human mother as she was, and always will be her baby gryphon.<br />
<br />
The two were soon out of the building and in the air. &quot;So tell me, where are the other idiotic males?&quot; she asked as Chad began guiding Lisara to...</p>
