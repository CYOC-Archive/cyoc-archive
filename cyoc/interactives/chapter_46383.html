<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick was still hyperventilating. He couldn't help it though, this couldn't be happening. How the hell could he be changed into a girl? It didn't make sense, there was no way the human body could change like this. Yet that is apparently what happened. The only thing that he could think of was that this was a dream. That had to be it, his mother had told him what the school said and now his sleeping mind was using that as material for this dream. Now that he knew it was a dream he would be waking up in just a few seconds. His vision went black as he thought he was waking up.<br />
<br />
When he did wake up he sighed thinking that was a strange dream. Maybe he shouldn't think about that stuff before going to bed. He chuckled thinking how freaked out he was in the dream. His good mood didn't last as a female voice beside him said &quot;I see you're awake. I told you you would faint if you didn't calm down.&quot;<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes and sat bolt upright. As he did he felt weight on his chest that shouldn't be there. He looked down and saw his breasts. That wasn't the only thing he saw though. He saw that he wasn't dressed in the clothes he came into the school with. Instead he had the school uniform on. &quot;Wha... what?&quot; he asked simply starting to freak again.<br />
<br />
Two hands were placed on his shoulders again and the girl said &quot;Please try to remain calm. I know it's hard but you don't want to faint again. I'll explain what happened but you need to remain awake to hear it.&quot; She smiled the said &quot;By the way, my name's Rachael.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick took a couple of deep breaths which helped to calm him down. He looked at Rachael and said &quot;Well nice to meet you Rachael. I'm Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachael giggled and said &quot;Well you'll want to come up with a new name but that can wait. Now I'll explain what happened.&quot; She seemed to be gathering her thoughts before speaking again. &quot;This school was built ten years ago. A week after it opened a witch by the name of Karen came and placed a curse on the school. Any male attending the school would become a female once they entered. This does not apply to the faculty or anyone else that is not a student here. Of course it doesn't affect the ones that were born girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You expect me to believe that?&quot; Rick asked incredulously.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can see for yourself that it's true&quot; Rachael said. &quot;You became a girl as soon as you came into the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Rick said with a sigh. &quot;But why did Karen do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well&quot; Rachael started and hesitated. She bit her lower lip before continuing &quot;No one knows. Some think that a student here played with her emotions or raped her. In either case she was mad enough to make the curse stick. The transformation can be reversed once the transformed person leaves the school grounds but it must be done within fifty-one days. After that the transformation becomes permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can the transformation be reversed?&quot; Rick asked calming down some more. He would be able to become himself again.<br />
<br />
Rachael looked down and said &quot;Male spit has to enter the transformed person's mouth. The most common way is through a kiss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to kiss a GUY!?&quot; Rick asked not believing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid so&quot; Rachael said a bit sadly. &quot;It has to be a real kiss and not a peck on the lips.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick laid back down and groaned &quot;Well if it breaks the curse I guess I can do it once.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachael sighed and said &quot;It doesn't work like that. Once you come back into the school you'll transform again.&quot; She looked at him and must have seen the shock on his face because she said &quot;You'll get used to it though. I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a guy?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not anymore&quot; Rachael said looking down again. &quot;It's been fifty-three days since my last transformation. I'm a girl permanently now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick felt sorry for her being stuck as a girl. &quot;I'm sorry&quot; he said and meant it.<br />
<br />
Rachael looked back up smiling. &quot;I'll get used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick looked back down at his body. &quot;How did I get dressed in this?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Rachael didn't answer right away but blushed. When she finally spoke she said &quot;Well... the Headmaster had me take your measurements. The nurse helped me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick looked confused and asked &quot;Where did the uniform come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The school keeps them on hand for the males that come here&quot; Rachael said smiling. &quot;Don't worry, the clothes are new and have never been worn.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Well' Rick thought, 'that's one worry down. But what am I going to do now?'</p>
