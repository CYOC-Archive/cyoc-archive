<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Stand up, dear,&quot; Alexa chided.  “Let’s get a good look at you.”  Rick struggled to his feet.  His center of gravity was drastically changed so it was difficult at first.  When he was able to straighten himself out, we were impressed by what we saw.  Rick was definitely gorgeous and had an incredible body.  However, that was also the problem.  The body he had was something out of a sexist’s wet dream.  His waist was tiny and his hips much larger than his waist.  His ass was very prominent.  And as for his breasts, well, they were probably E or F cups.  They were most certainly bigger than Alexa’s breasts.  <br />
<br />
His breasts were now a problem because as soon as he stood up straight, he could not continue to do so for more than a few seconds.  He had to lean back slightly to keep himself held up.  The look on his face told me that it caused a lot of pain in his back.  Now I understood why some woman had their breasts reduced.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, that’s a problem,” Alexa observed.  “We can’t have you constantly in pain, so I wish that you would be in total control of your new body in terms of being able to stand up straight with those huge boobs and not feel any kind of pain for doing so.”  Rick’s posture changed so that he was totally upright again and the look of pain dissipated from his face.  “I also wish, just in case, that you still would not be able to leave or try to harm either of us physically.”  I looked at her with confusion.  She saw my face and explained, “He’s got a new body, who knows if that wish still applied?”<br />
<br />
“Good point,” I agreed.  “No unnecessary chances.”<br />
<br />
“What are you gonna do with me?” Rick finally asked.  His eyes went wide when he heard his voice.  So did Alexa’s and so did mine.  His voice possessed a rather noticeable Texas twang.  It dawned on me that his ideal woman was practically some type of very young Dolly Parton, just from a different state.<br />
<br />
“Like I said, Rick,” Alexa explained.  “We don’t want to hurt you.  We want you to learn a few lessons.  How fast you do that is entirely up to you.  So you’re going to be our maid.  First thing you need is a uniform.  We’re not going with a traditional maid’s uniform, mind you.  I think we’ve done a nice job of giving you a new body, so it deserves to be shown off.  So your uniform is just going to be a very thin thong.  I wish I had it in my hand right now.”  She held out her right hand and a red garment appeared instantly.  She tossed it to Rick, who caught it, and commanded, “Put it on.”<br />
<br />
Rick did not bother to argue and put his legs through the unfamiliar underwear.  It was a perfect fit for him.  It was definitely a very thin thong as it was nothing more than a string connecting the front to the back and it left almost all of his ass exposed.  “How ‘m I s’posed to be a maid lookin’ like this?” he asked.  His accent was really strong.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about that,” I said.  “Just do what we tell you to do when we tell you to.”  <br />
<br />
“Quite right,” Alexa agreed.  “We don’t have anything for you to do right now, so let’s show you your room.”  Alexa walked to the hallway and beckoned for Rick to follow.  He did so slowly and with uncertainty.  I followed behind him and he kept looking over his shoulder at me.  I had a few ideas as to why.<br />
<br />
Alexa stopped in front of a door that was a spare bedroom I never used.  We had already made some modifications to the room thanks to a wish.  She opened the door and walked in.  Rick dutifully followed with me still close behind.  The room was furnished with only a few items.  There was a single bed, big enough for one person and one person only.  There was a small dresser with three drawers that had a mirror attached to the top of it.  There was a closet that was totally empty.  Finally, there was a bookcase that was filled with various types of self-help and instructional books.  Those books were all essentially about how to live a better life by being a better person.  We intended for Rick to spend a lot of time in this room and with nothing else to do, we figured he’d have to read eventually.  Alexa previously confirmed to me that he wasn’t the reading type.  Something would have to give.<br />
<br />
“Obviously, this isn’t much,” Alexa admitted.  “It’s all you need.  The bathroom is right across the hall.  You’ll be the only person using it, but you’re still expected to keep it clean.”<br />
<br />
Rick looked around the room.  He appeared as if he was going to cry, but he held it back.  Clearly he still retained some measure of willpower.  “What do I do now?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Nothing, really,” Alexa said.  “We have some things to do, but we don’t need you for anything right now.  So just stay here and get acclimated.  We’ll call you when we need you, and when we call, you are expected to be prompt.”<br />
<br />
Rick sat on the end of the bed.  “What if I don’t hear ya’ll?  You gonna beat me or somethin’?”<br />
<br />
Alexa rolled her eyes.  “Oh, fine.  I wish that you would hear when we call you no matter what distance apart we are or how many barriers might stand in the way,” she said.<br />
<br />
Rick looked dejected.  “Oh.  OK,” he said with defeat.  I chuckled.  He thought he had us and could come up with an excuse, but he was easily trumped.  <br />
<br />
“We do believe in personal space, though, Rick,” she said, “so you may keep this door closed when you are in here.  In fact, keep this door closed when you’re not in here either.  This is your sanctuary for now.  You’ll be able to hear us when we need you anyway.”  She walked to the door and I stepped into the hallway.  “Oh, and one last thing,” she added.  “You are still ‘Rick.’  We will still call you ‘Rick.’  Deep down, that’s who you still are and in order for you to learn your lesson, you must remember that.”  With that her face turned to a bright smile and she chirped, “Bye for now!” and closed the door.<br />
<br />
We walked back to the living room and sat down on the couch.  I looked at her.  She was grinning from ear to ear.  I was so glad that the ring’s power made her this happy.  “Next phase,” I said with a wink.</p>
