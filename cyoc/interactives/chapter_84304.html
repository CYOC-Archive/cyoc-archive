<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Molly finished scrapping her former lover off her foot and sat down on the bed to think about what to do next. She looked at the all powerful ring that was now on her finger. Her finger?! She had fingers and thumbs! She was a bipedal human being now! This ring made her a woman, made her master a dog, and her lover was changed into a bug and stomped to death. She had to be careful with this ring.<br />
<br />
She looked over at Meeghan. Having been a dog, she could tell exactly what Meeghan was thinking of just by her body movements. She could tell Meeghan was saddened to lose her humanity and being transformed into a dog.  Meeghan has always been kind of Molly since day one and took care of her really well.  She didn’t want her master to be treated like a dog, so she decided to make things right.  With the ring on her finger, Molly closed her eyes and said, “I wish my master would return to normal.”<br />
<br />
The ring started to glow as it accepted the new owner’s wish.  At the same time, Meeghan whimpered as she felt both tingle and pain at the same time.  That is when the changes started.  First her bone structure shifted as her knees cracked to its proper position, making her stand up straight and on two legs.  Then all the fur on her body sank back into her skin, leaving her completely bare.  Her front paws grew long and slender as her claws shifted back into regular nails, turning them back into her hands.  Same goes with her back paws as the heel were gently placed to the ground and they changed back to her regular feet.  Her tail shrank back and into her rear until it disappeared completely.  Her womanly shape immediately returned as her rear expanded, her hips flared out, and her breasts grew back to her C-cups.  The extra nipples that she had on her stomach grew small and disappeared completely.  The only thing that was left is the head as her muzzle shortened and went flat on her face, her black nose was back to peach and was dry, her floppy ears retracted and moved back to the side of her head, her tongue returned to normal, her growls turned back to moans, and her canine teeth changed back to human.  Her blonde hair grew back and went down to her back and her eyes returned to normal as she saw color instead of black and white.  Lastly, her intelligence returned and she remembered about what happened to her.  In a matter of minutes, Meeghan went back from being a dog to a human.<br />
<br />
Meeghan looked at herself and breathed a sigh of relief that she’s back to normal.  But then she looked at the now human Molly and the ring she had, realizing it was her that saved her life.  “Molly?” she said feeling a little confused.  Molly just had a small smile and said, “Yes master, it’s me.”  Meeghan felt very happy as she rushed to her and gave her a deep hug.  “Oh Molly…  Thank you for saving me!” she said feeling completely gleeful, “I thought I would be stuck as a dog forever.”  Molly just look to her master and said with a calming tone, “Oh don’t mention it.  That guy was a real jerk to you and he deserved to be punished.  He had to pay for turning you into a bitch that I was.”  Meeghan let got of the hug and laughed a little, knowing that her former pet was making a joke.  She then looked around the blank and empty room and decided that it was time to leave.  But giving that there was no door around, she turned to Molly and asked, “Hey Molly, you think you can wish us out of this room and back to the apartment.”  Molly simply smiled and said, “Of course master.”  So she closed her eyes and wished silently to herself with a slight smirk to her face.  In a matter of moments, the two disappeared and the room was completely empty.<br />
<br />
At the same time, both Meeghan and Molly appeared in a different room.  That was the bedroom of Meeghan’s apartment.  Meeghan looked around and was pleased that she’s back home.  “Finally, I’m back home.” She said with reassurance, “Thought for sure that I would never see this place again.”  She continued to look around and notice something not right.  The one thing that got her attention was that there were two beds in her apartment, not one.  “That’s odd…” she said in pure confusion, “I don’t remember having two beds.  How did this second one get here?”  Molly heard that and snickered a little bit, wanting to see if her former master will figure it out herself.  Meeghan looked around some more, wondering why she had two beds to begin with.  But then, she spotted a picture on her nightstand and took a good look at it.  Normally the picture showed her and her former pet Molly.  But now the picture has changed.  It now showed her and a human Molly with a plaque that reads, ‘Best Sisters Forever.’  Meeghan looked at this picture and was a little confused, saying, “Best sisters forever?  Wha…”  Before she could figure it out, memories entered into her head.  Altered memories of her and her sister born together, the times they played together, the times they weeped together after loosing their fathers, when they had each other’s backs, and supporting each other during their college years.  Feeling every memory entering her mind, she soon realized something she didn’t thought was possible.  Molly must’ve changed reality along with returning to the apartment!<br />
<br />
Turning to her former pet, she asked, “Molly?  Did you do this?”  Molly noddingly smiled and said, “Yes master, yes I did.  Or perhaps I should call you sister from now on.”  “But why did you do that?” Meeghan continued to ask, “Shouldn’t you be better off being a dog from the start?”  Molly looked to her now sister and explained about it.  “Well I was thinking about returning to a dog after stopping that man from humiliating you.  But then I didn’t feel like doing it.  Though I like to be return into my former form, but…  Well…  Look at me!  I now have the body and mind of a human!  I can do things I would never do in my previous form.  The possibilities are endless!  I can drive a car, I can drink alcohol, I can fall in love without the occasional dry humping, I can learn human studies, I can do anything a certain dog can’t.  I almost feels like a dream come true.  And Meeghan, you’ve treated me so well since I was a pup.  What better way to thank you then to become a part of your family.  Besides, you’ve always wanted to have a twin sister, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
Meeghan listened and couldn’t believe all that she was hearing.  Molly wants to live her life as a human now.  It would seem impossible for her to adapt to this new world she’s embarking.  But looking into her gleaming eyes, she could tell that she wants this newfound freedom compared to what Molly once was.  Not to mention that she doesn’t want to feel like the only child in the family.  So looking to her, she smiled and said, “All right.  You got me there.  You can be both a human and my sister if you don’t do anything that will embarrass me.  Is that a deal?”  Molly smiled from ear to ear as she rushed to her former master and gave her a big warm hug.  “You thank you so much sister.” she said with a gleeful expression, “I promise that I will be a good human.”  Meeghan laughed a little as she let go of the hug and decided to refresh herself.  “That’s great Molly.” she said as she headed to the bathroom, “Now I’m going to start taking a shower.  After what I went through, I really need to clean myself up.”  So she headed to the bathroom and locked the door just to get a private shower.<br />
<br />
As she was showering, Molly approached the full-length mirror and admires herself at it.  Looking at her naked body, it felt both foreign, yet sexy at the same time.  Placing her hands on her huge breasts, she gave them a squeeze and never knew how soft they were.  She felt a little flushed as she continued to squeeze them a couple of more times.  She then looked down at her pussy filled with a neatly trimmed blonde pubes and guided her finger into her slit.  She moaned silently as she was enjoying herself more and more.  After a few good minutes of self-masturbation, she stopped and posed to the side to get a better view of herself.  Molly smirked to herself and said, “Gotta say girl.  You are way more hotter then what you’ve use to have been.”  As she was admiring herself, she heard her new sister from behind.  “Whenever you’re done loving yourself, the bathroom is ready for you.”  Molly turned around to see Meeghan standing there with her hands on her hips and a sly smile to her face.  Molly was red in embarrassment as she said, “Oh…  Right…  Of course…  I’m going.”  She then headed to the bathroom while her former master asked, “Do you know how to shower?  Cause I’ll show you how it works before you hurt yourself.”  But Molly turned and said, “Oh no, it’s okay.  The guy that turned me human gave me the knowledge of a human.  I think I know what shampoo and soup is.”<br />
<br />
She then closed the door and was ready to take her first human shower.  But before she could do anything, Molly looked at the ring she took from the perverted Jack and smiled very lively.  It was this ring that turned her from a dog to a human.  Now that she had the ring in her possession, she could wish for whatever she wants.  There are many possibilities for her to do.  The main question though is exactly what will Molly do with her new power?</p>
