<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Iphis and Ianthe had been seeking a mate (or mates) since practically when they were first uplifted. But the process was very long. There were plenty of people who&#39;d be too intimidated to date a two-headed, nearly 7 feet tall, anaconda Animalian, let alone become the bondmate of one who was also a hermaphrodite. But thanks to the sisters&#39; diligence, their efforts have finally paid off.<br />
<br />
Typhoon and Waterlily may seemed like the most mismatched couple imaginable, but they really went well together. Iphis particularly respected liked Typhoon&#39;s rugged determination and sense of responsibility that one wouldn&#39;t expected from a Mohawk-wearing, tattoo-covered punk. And Ianthe found Waterlily&#39;s bubbly charm and slightly vapid ways endearing and she was smarter than what most people would expect from a hippy.<br />
<br />
Even so, Iphis and Ianthe didn&#39;t convert the couple immediately. They really had to get to know them to see if they were really ideal. Because their eventual goal is not just to make them anacondas, but to make them hermaphroditic as well. The theory for it was sound enough. Iphis and Ianthe were purely female until they were spliced with DNA from a two-headed herm rat snake named &quot;We&quot;. It was simply a matter of isolating the unique X/Y chromosome formation in their DNA and making sure it was emphasized enough with the main injections.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, this gene could make anyone into a herm? Not just snakes?&quot; asked Typhoon as the scientists prepared the solution.<br />
<br />
&quot;In general theory, yes,&quot; said a female scientist, &quot;All animals may have different chromosome counts, but they all share the same XX or XY chromosome for sexes. Though there are some exceptions, with some reptiles and birds using a ZW system, but that&#39;s a different matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you been tampering with sex genetics for a while?&quot; asked Ianthe, a little discomforted.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not really. Our focus has been mainly just animal transformations. I don&#39;t think there would be a lot of people who like it if they knew we could switch genders around,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t actually do that, can you?&quot; asked Iphis, &quot;Not complete male to female chances and vice versa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there are some species of tropical fish and frogs who can changed their sex when there&#39;s a lack of one gender. And there are species of whiptail lizards that are completely female and reproduce by parthenogenesis,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I&#39;m getting lost here,&quot; said Waterlily in a confused tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I suppose I am rambling a bit now,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, once you&#39;ve cornered the herm gene, what are you going to be putting it into?&quot; asked Typhoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first choice is a spotted hyena. The next choice will be whiptail lizards to see if they can remain self-fertilizing with both sets of genitalia available. We&#39;re planning on uplifting some of those lizards without the &#39;herm gene&#39;, as you call it, to see if they&#39;ll still function as before,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Far out...&quot; said Waterlily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but enough about what may come. Here is what you want in the now,&quot; said the scientist. The concentrated XXY solution anaconda solution (or in other words, &#39;Essence of Iphis & Ianthe&#39;) was completed and syringed were already prepped and ready. &quot;Now, I should remind you that you should remove all piercings before we administer this,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
It took only a few moments for Waterlily, but a bit longer for Typhoon. He looked at his tattoos one last time before saying, &quot;I&#39;m going to miss these guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have a blank slate to start over with,&quot; said Waterlily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope scales won&#39;t be hard to tattoo,&quot; said Typhoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least I won&#39;t need glasses anymore,&quot; said Waterlily.<br />
<br />
Eventually, they went into the &#39;changing room&#39;. It didn&#39;t take a lot of time for Typhoon and Waterlily to strip off all their clothes. They weren&#39;t particularly embarrassed to be naked in front of Iphis and Ianthe. Truthfully, the two of them have had sex where the two-headed hermaphrodite could watch with lust and longing. The twins watched eagerly as Typhoon and Waterlily injected themselves and waited for the changes to happen.<br />
<br />
The first sign of change was a weakness in the legs, forcing both of them to sit down. Soon, they were both feeling a great amount of heat, particularly in their loins. Though the two of them held off on having sex on the very unlikely change they might merge together, that didn&#39;t stop them from stimulating themselves. Waterlily groped her breasts as she fingered her pussy while Typhoon was stroking his dick. They were so caught up in this, they didn&#39;t notice the scales starting to appear. Green scales were quickly spreading across their body, erasing years of permanent ink for a blank emerald slate.<br />
<br />
But then they both felt a strong pulling in their hips that made them look down. As they watched, their thighs started to fuse together as green scales over took them. Knees and ankles lost their rigidity as the bones that comprised them converted into more vertebrate. Their feet went limp as their toes disappeared before they melted together to form the ends of their growing tails.<br />
<br />
But then Typhoon felt an odd tightness in his chest. He reached up to feel pecs, finding them a lot softer than before. No, his muscles were still there, but now there was extra padding there. That extra padding became more noticeable as the flesh beneath his nipples started to rise. He grasped his larger nipples and gasped at their sudden sensitivity. The pleasure raced down to a spot right behind his ballsack, which was already shrinking as his testicles were moving inside him. He reached down past his dick, which was already starting to fission, to feel that tender spot, moaning softly as he felt it start to deepen.<br />
<br />
Waterlily, on the other hand, felt like her clit was glowing red hot. She was desperately trying to soothe it by rubbing it. Then to her surprise, it started to grow in her hand. Or something similar to it as her vagina was sliding a bit further down her longer pelvis. What Waterlily was rubbing was quickly growing bigger in her hand. In a few seconds, it clearly divided into two rods that she grasped with both hands as they kept growing.<br />
<br />
Typhoon and Waterlily were rapidly learning the pleasures of masturbating as the other sex. Though that didn&#39;t mean their original sex were withering away. In fact, Waterlily&#39;s breasts were actually growing larger than they had before, supported by the strengthening pectorals beneath them. Typhoon&#39;s cock had become two impressive hemipenis, but they were being ignored in favor of <i>hir</i> plunging <i>hir</i> fingers into <i>hir</i> new pussy. The two of them made more hissing noises as the changes finally spread up their necks which were growing longer. Their faces extended out into blunt muzzles as their eyes became slits and their teeth became sharp. It was soon after that that they finally came, potent serpent cum gushing from new orifices.<br />
<br />
The final result were a pair of hermaphroditic anacondas that looked a lot like slightly smaller, one-headed versions of Iphis and Ianthe. They had a very fine set of amazonian muscles and curves, though not as big as big as the twins&#39;. Interestingly, both Waterlily and Typhoon kept their hair. Though in Typhoon&#39;s case, more hair had sprouted up on either side of hir Mohawk, which was also looking longer and not as stiff.<br />
<br />
Typhoon felt hir hairier head and said, &quot;Thisss isss ssstrange.&quot; Hir voice sounded softer and lighter than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mussst be the essstrogen,&quot; said Waterlily, her voice a little deeper, both of them show the sibilant-hissing tendency that newly-changed snake Animalians had.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look really sssexy though,&quot; said Typhoon, eying Waterlily&#39;s bigger rack and double dicks with equal interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can sssay the sssame for you,&quot; said Waterlily, her eyes eating up Typhoon&#39;s intersex body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast,&quot; said Iphis&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you forgetting someone?&quot; asked Ianthe&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
The newly-turned anacondas turned to look at the original one. Both heads were looking at them both with naked lust. Their nipples were fully erect as well as their impressive hemipenis. Typhoon and Waterlily both felt themselves getting wet just looking at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve been leaving you out of the fun too long,&quot; said Typhoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;sss time you joined in,&quot; said Waterlily.<br />
<br />
Iphis and Ianthe grinned before pushing the two of them further onto the bed, pressing them close enough for breasts and dicks to touch. &quot;Come to mama,&quot; purred Ianthe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or more appropriately, come to papa,&quot; said Iphis before they plunged down, impaling both Ty and Lily&#39;s pussies with their dicks. The four of them gasped loudly at the sensation. It was only for Lily that this feeling wasn&#39;t new. Iphis and Ianthe never had the chance to have sex with someone before, their hermaphrodite nature being off-putting to a lot of others. But now they were finally experiencing the joys of it. For Typhoon, this obviously was a new experience for hir.<br />
<br />
To heighten the sensation, Lily reached up and latched onto Ianthe&#39;s breast. Ty did the same with Ianthe&#39;s. The twins moaned as they felt their lovers suckling their tangy milk. This drove them to plunge even harder, driving them all closer to the edge. Finally, the two-headed anaconda erupted inside the smaller ones, sending them both over the edge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, that felt good,&quot; said Ianthe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I finally know what guys are getting off about,&quot; said Iphis.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not done yet,&quot; said Lily, sliding hirself free from Ianthe&#39;s shaft. Shi rubbed her own dicks and said, &quot;I ssstill need to get thessse boysss off.&quot; With that, shi plunged into Iphis and Ianthe&#39;s pussy. The twins gave a loud moan at that. They hadn&#39;t been penetrated before either.<br />
<br />
Ty coiled up close to Lily and said coyly, &quot;You naughty boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What you going to do about it, big girl?&quot; asked Lily in a flirty tone. Ty gave hir an answer by plugging hir own dicks into Lily&#39;s pussy.<br />
<br />
After that, the scene dissolved into a small orgy, the three anacondas plunging and being plunged with abandon. For a few wild minutes, they ended up coiling into a sex ball, where it became impossible to tell who was going into who. Needless to say, between the milk gushes and the unconfined cum, the changing room became very messy.<br />
<br />
Eventually, they settled down in a post-orgasmic bliss. Typhoon rubbed hir belly thoughtfully, wondering if shi&#39;d be a mother or a father first? Or both. &quot;You think any of usss got knocked up?&quot; shi asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve cccertainly done it enough time for it to happen,&quot; said Waterlily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ssso how do we know who impregnated who?&quot; asked Typhoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sssure it will work itssself out,&quot; said Waterlily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it will, because we already know who will be the parents,&quot; said Iphis.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all the parents here,&quot; said Ianthe, &quot;Every egg we lay belongs to all of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was certainly agreeable to everyone. It would certainly be one of the least oddest things about this very interesting trio.</p>
