<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>The Angel Whose Name Starts With a T took several steps backwards. He readied his sword. However, he knew that he wouldn't be able to use it. Swords tended to either maime or kill, something he wasn't willing to do.</p>

<p>Perhaps, he wondered, if he could fashion a revolver, there were another weapons he could as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, his concentration was broken as one of the vixens kicked him in the midriff, sending him flying onto his back. He dropped his sword.</p>

<p>"I don't want to hurt you!" the man yelled.</p>

<p>He had to roll to his side as another vixen took a swing at him with her sword.</p>

<p>Thinking fast, the man knew that while he couldn't kill them or inflict a permanent injury on them, perhaps he could do enough to render them unconscious.</p>

<p>Grabbing his sword, he concentrated until the weapon turned into a liquid like form and covered both of his hands. When it solidified, it had become gloves with small electrodes on the fingertips.</p>

<p>As her companions watched, the same vixen took another swing at the man. This time, he dodged and grabbed the sword his right hand. He used his glove to send just enough energy through it to travel through the sword and knock her out. She yelped and dropped the sword before falling to the ground.</p>

<p><i>One down eight to go.</i></p>

<p>The man remembered another weapon, one the humans of today considered futuristic. As the eight remaining vixens charged at him, the man stood up and did several back flips until he had some distance between he and the group. He again concentrated, this time forming his gloves into an energy pistol that had a stun setting.</p>

<p>Aiming the weapon, he fired. He managed to stun four of the vixens before the remaining four caught up to him. One of the four swung at his pistol, cutting it in two!</p>

<p><i>Perfect, just perfect!</i></p>

<p>The man knew he was going to have to resort to stronger measures. The vixens armor didn't protect against the beam of that pistol but it would protect against his fists. However, all he needed to do was to touch their foreheads with his cross to free them.</p>

<p>Running between the quartette, he crouched and spun his right leg around to knock each off them off of their feet. He leapt onto the one in front of him and pressed his cross against her forehead.</p>

<p>"What did you do to her?" one of the remaining three asked.</p>

<p>"I freed her. Let me free you so we can stop this!" the man replied.</p>

<p>The man stood and readied himself. All three remaining vixens swung at him. Dogding left and right, he kicked the sword from the hands of one before grabbing her and flipping her over his head.</p>

<p>The other two slashed at him. He managed to kick one of their swords away but the other slashed at him and managed to cut the chain on his necklace. It fell to the ground with a clang.</p>

<p>"What happened to me?" the vixen he'd just helped asked.</p>

<p>The vixen with the sword pointed it at the man's throat as the other one picked up his necklace.</p>

<p>"Why are you guys doing this?" the now free vixen asked.</p>

<p>"I only wished to help you," the man said.</p>

<p>"Hey, leave him alone. Now I remember. He's trying to help us!"</p>

<p>"Barbara, I don't know what he's done to you but," the vixen with the sword said.</p>

<p>Barbara ran towards the vixen holding the cross. "Vicki, If you let him help you, you'll see the truth!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter who we were before. This is our purpose in life now. If the master has freed us from our former selfish existence," Vicki said. She looked at the cross. "You're just trying to force us back into a former life that doesen't matter any more. This is our lives now!"</p>

<p>"The master wants us to kill you," the vixen with the sword said.</p>

<p>"But what do you want?" the man asked.</p>

<p>"Let him show us the truth, then we can decide!" Barbara said.</p>

<p>"No, the master would tell us to do that if he wished it!" the vixen with the sword said.</p>

<p>Barbara saw that the vixen the man had thrown over his shoulders was recovering. She knew this could soon be a problem. Without thinking, she snatched the cross from Vicki and pushed it against her forehead.</p>

<p>"Traitor!" the vixen with the sword yelled. When she aimed it to attack Barbara, the man grabbed it from her hand and threw it to the ground.</p>

<p>Vikie, who was dazed, looked at the others. The man knew he'd have some serious explaining to do once he freed them.</p>

<p>Barbara handed the cross back to the man, who pressed it against the vixen that used to have the sword to his forehead. The man looked at the approaching vixen that he'd thrown over this shoulders.</p>

<p>"Let me help you as well," he said.</p>

<p>"No, the master will kill us if we betray him!"</p>

<p>"He is not your master! You are your own masters!" the man said.</p>

<p>"Listen to him. I'm glad I can think clearly again," Barbara said.</p>

<p>"No, the master doesn't command it!"</p>

<p>The man knew that he had little choice, the man leapt at the vixen and pressed the cross to her forehead, leaving him with four confused but free vixens.</p>

<p>"Now to free the others," the man said.</p>

<p>"I underestimated you. Or perhaps I haven't. Go ahead, give them back their former selfish lives. Take them from a meaningful existence. I can just recruit others," Karthur said.</p>

<p>The man frowned. He had to stop Karthur before he made good on his threat.</p>


*******

<p>"How do I look?" Janice asked.</p>

<p>Tammie looked at her friend. Janice had dressed in attire similar to Alexsandra.</p>

<p>"Better then being naked," Tammie said.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do? I mean, what if we can't find a way back? What if we're stuck as vixens forever?" Janice asked.</p>

<p>"Then I guess we'll learn to live with it," Tammie said.</p>

<p>Janice appeared even more upset.</p>

<p>"Look, we still have each other. Besides, there's a lot of things a lot worse to be then a vixen," Tammie said.</p>

<p>"Maybe but I don't know anything about being a girl!" Janice said.</p>

<p>"You think I do? We'll figure it out."</p>

<p>With that Tammie hugged Janice, the action feeling natural.</p>

<p>"Now come on, let's figure out what's happening," Tammie said.</p>

<p>Janice nodded and they headed back towards the front of the building.</p></p>
