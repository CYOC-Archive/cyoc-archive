<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>To reset the tone of the story I incuded the previous chapter(s). The additions I made are through out the story. Note to the previous authors. I hope you like the changes I have made.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My name is Joe Morgan. I live in a no name suburb just out side of the big city. The big city has no redeeming qualities to make it stand out in the world. It had its public transit system of buses that run somewhat on time. Even though I had a car sitting in the public parking lot at the bus station, I choose to take the bus to work and avoid the traffic problems. The bus stop in the city was only a few blocks from work and it was a lot cheaper than a parking garage. <br />
<br />
The day at work was uneventful as always. The ride home was as uneventful as the day at work but it was a lot less stressful than driving. Such was the life of a CPA. The public parking lot for the bus line was next to a shopping center. I wanted to pick up a few grooming products before heading home. I walked over to the nearby drug store to do my shopping. Within a few minutes my shopping was done and I was standing at the check out line. The person before me was a little old lady fishing through her purse for coupons for the products on the counter. Finding what she was searching for she placed her purse back into the shopping cart. . The old ladies demeanor reminded of my grandmother that had passed away a few years ago. You wouldn’t mind waiting for  either of them in any line no matter how late you were. She paid for her items and exited the store. Being the next person in line I placed my purchases on the counter. Sensing my frustration in having to wait the checkout person spoke up.<br />
<br />
“Don’t mind Mrs. Johnson.”  She said.  “She is the sweetest little old lady around.”<br />
<br />
“I know the type.” I replied. “My grandmother was the same way before she passed away.”<br />
<br />
After receiving condolences from the checkout person I paid for items and left the store. As I walked to my car I passed the cart corral and noticed a familiar purse. I looked around for the owner and spotted her sitting at the bus stop.<br />
<br />
The old lady had left her purse in the store. I grabbed it and ran after her, just as her bus was pulling up. She said she wanted to thank me, but I told her it wasn't necessary. And, besides, her bus was here. <br />
<br />
Then, the bus suddenly died. The lady paid no attention to it, but continued looking in her  purse. And then, she pulled out a ring. <br />
<br />
"Here you are. Put this on your finger!" <br />
<br />
It looked like a plain brass ring with nothing special to distinguish it. Where a jewel or an engraving should be was just a flat, blank oval. <br />
<br />
"I think it's too small," I said, trying not to hurt her feelings. <br />
<br />
"T'won't matter a bit!" she said. "Go ahead, slip it on your finger!" <br />
<br />
I put the ring on and, to my surprise, as it slid down my finger, it stretched and then contracted, until it WAS a perfect fit! <br />
<br />
"Now, first thing you do is say 'I wish no one could take this ring off my finger!'" I repeated what she said, like I was in a trance. She smiled and said "Now, from now on, it will grant your fondest wishes!" <br />
<br />
After that, she said nothing, but turned, and got on the bus. As soon as she was on, the engine came to life again, and the bus pulled away. <br />
<br />
My fondest wishes? She must be crazy, I thought. But then, it had adjusted itself to fit on my finger! <br />
<br />
I looked around, and saw a gorgeous female across the street. Remembering what the old lady had said, I said "I wish the clothes of the female I'm looking at would disappear.”<br />
<br />
And, just like that, she had nothing on, except for the shoulder strap of her purse! <br />
<br />
I looked at her more carefully as she stood there like nothing had happened. I wished for her clothes to re appear and they did.<br />
<br />
Seeing that the girl had indeed become naked, I began to think of the seemingly limitless possibilities. I decide that I could make an impact on the world. I make an other wish. With a little more thought behind it.<br />
<br />
"I wish that I had a secret, hi-tech, underground facility that I can use as my base of operations. I also wish that I knew the whereabouts of the entrance and how to enter."<br />
<br />
Just then the location pops into my mind. I know exactly where it is and it was in the most place.<br />
<br />
I go get into my car and drive down the street to the secret base. I knew exactly where I was going. I pulled into the driveway of  the secret base. It was at my house. I enter the house and go into the den. Along one wall were shelves lined with books. As if by habit I pull on a random set of books on the shelves to reveal the concealed entrance. The one man elevator takes me down several hundred feet below ground level and opens up into a cavernous dimly lit room. In the center of the room sits a giant computer terminal. The blinking lights indicate that the computer is never turned off. Casually I issue the following commands.<br />
<br />
“Lights at 75%.” The dimly lit room brightens up considerably. <br />
<br />
“Computer on.” The various unlit panels blink to life.<br />
<br />
“Displays on.”  The computer displays a complete list of every person on earth. It scrolls down the seemingly endless list of names, highlighting each one briefly.<br />
<br />
"How should I use this to affect the world?"<br />
<br />
I look at the giant screen before me. Its sheer size took up the whole back wall like a giant movie screen. The Omni Max screen displayed a computer rendering of the world in 3D. Below the display was a counter labeled "CURRENT WORLD POPULATION". Its last few numbers turned slowly constantly updating the total. <br />
<br />
A duplicate yet smaller version lay before me at my computer terminal. All I had to do was to touch the display and the computer would zoom in on that spot. Depending on the pressure of my touch  the magnification varied. The more pressure I applied the stronger the zoom became.<br />
<br />
Testing out how sensitive the zoom was I zoomed in on my home town. The detail was remarkable. It looked like I was actually hovering one hundred feet above my neighborhood. This was not a static view like a picture but I could see movement in the area. Cars were driving down the road and people were working in their yards. I zoomed to a ground level view on my neighbor’s house and saw the snot nosed kid  Jimmie doing some skating trick on his backyard ramps. Ever since his father built the ramps for him I haven’t had a minute of peace in my back yard. Time to try out this new computer.<br />
<br />
“Computer, I would like to make some changes to the area in the current view.”<br />
<br />
SPECIFIC PERAMETERS REQUIRED<br />
<br />
“I want the skateboard ramps replaced with a swimming pool that fills the backyard.”<br />
<br />
Just as the  Jimmie was at the apex of his latest jump the ramp below him changed into an Olympic size pool. Expecting to see a ramp awaiting him on his return trip the surprised Jimmie falls into the water.<br />
<br />
“OOOH that’s got to hurt.” I say out loud.<br />
<br />
I watched Jimmie swim to the side of the pool, leaving his floating skateboard behind. The extra layers of clothing made it difficult for him to keep his head above water.<br />
<br />
“Computer remove all clothing from the swimmer before he drowns.”<br />
<br />
EXTERNIAL COVERING REMOVAL COMPLETED<br />
<br />
It was hard to see the clothing disappear while Jimmie was under the water. Quickly he resurfaced, gasping for air, and grabbed for the ladder. The now naked teenage stood on the side of pool. Amazingly I could hear Jimmies heavy breathing as if I was there.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck happened to the ramp? What happened to my clothes?” Jimmie exclaimed looking down at him soaked naked body.<br />
<br />
“Now is that anyway for a nice looking young man to talk?”<br />
<br />
Jimmie looks around to see the owner of the voice. “Where the fuck are you faggot? When I get my hands on you you’ll regret spying on me.”<br />
<br />
“Such big talk from a little man. Let me see if I can change that. Computer age the young man to 25.”<br />
<br />
BODY AUGMENTATION COMINCING <br />
<br />
The body of the teenager grow bigger and bigger. His height increased to six foot two and his body gained one hundred pounds.<br />
<br />
“WhaT The fUck Are yOu  dOing to Me?” As Jimmie grew in size his voice changed. It lowered an octave or two giving him a deeper voice.<br />
<br />
“Just making you more likeable James.” I said to him. “Computer increase muscle mass by 25%.”<br />
<br />
All the muscles on James’s grew in size giving him a more athletic looking body.<br />
<br />
“Increase muscle mass another 25%, increase all over skin color by  35%, reduce body fat to 7% and reduce body hair to 5%.”<br />
<br />
The muscles grew in size again pushing his appearance past athletic to bodybuilder. A vast network of veins appeared just under the skin as it gained a darker hue. All the body hair that had grown in the process receded back into the body. The shaggy unkempt hair style gave way to a free style blond cut. The hair free body had just the right amount of pubic hair above the cock. <br />
<br />
“Now that you have the body to match your mouth let’s cover that body with something a little bit suitable. Computer, give James a swim suit. We can’t have him going around naked all day.”<br />
<br />
SPECIFY TYPE , COLOR AND SIZE<br />
<br />
“Random selection please. I’ll change it if I don’t like it.”<br />
<br />
A standard black board shorts appeared on James’s body.<br />
<br />
The James looked down at his new swim suit and said. “It’s about fuckin time.”<br />
<br />
“No, no, no computer that will never do. Make the suit smaller by 75%.”<br />
<br />
REDUCING SURFACE COVERAGE BY 75%<br />
<br />
“No wait I don’t my junk to be on display.”<br />
<br />
The board shorts shrank down Speedos size. <br />
<br />
“Why not show off what a dick you are? Computer, reduce suit coverage by another 25% computer.<br />
 <br />
The suit shrank down to a poser.<br />
<br />
“Good. That is just the right size but something is not quite big enough. Increase the size of his cock.”<br />
<br />
SPECIFY PERAMATERS<br />
<br />
“Increase length by 15%.” <br />
<br />
“What are fuck are you talking about increase length? I … Oh Gaud! … It feels like I have a hard on … Oh Gaud I‘m too big!”<br />
<br />
I watch as the bulge in his posers grows bigger. Not big enough to be obscene but big enough to get his attention.<br />
<br />
“Now one last change before I go. Make it so that everyone he knows, except me, thinks that he has always been this way. Make it so that he forgets this conversation and that he loves his new body.”<br />
<br />
WORLD AWARENESS AUGMENTATION COMMENCING<br />
<br />
I watch as the buff young man stands there by the pool as a nearly invisible wave of air passes over him. James picks up the towel on the nearby chaise longue and wipes off his body. He replaces the towel over chaise longue and proceeds to lie back down facing the sun. <br />
<br />
Still eavesdropping I watch him take a bottle of tanning oil and coat his body. He does his legs first than his arms and face. The last body part to get oil was his chest. With both hands he slowly slathers the oil over his chest and down his tight abs. He slips his hands inside his suit and massages his cock and balls. The added attention makes his bulge grow from respectful to obscene in his suit. The stretchy material can only contain so much manhood and burst open. The fleshy python stands straight up pointing towards the sun a good foot in its hardened state. Jets of pearlescent liquid shoot out arcing high into the sky landing two feet away.<br />
<br />
I let out an auditable gasp. James hears it and sits up “Who’s there?” Not seeing anyone he lies back down.<br />
<br />
“Computer, I think I went a little over board on the length. Reduce over all length 15% and make it so that he will never burst out of his clothes again.”<br />
<br />
James was unaware that his cock was shrinking size down to around 9 inches. His poser reformed over his cock reducing his bulge back down to a more manageable size.<br />
<br />
“Computer, Remind me if go overboard again.” The computer complied with a few auditable sound . “Now let’s see what else I can do in this world?”</p>
