<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick had typed in what had happened to her and said she would be back. She wanted to check on her family and see if they had changed as well. She lived with her parents to help with bills and stuff since her dad was disabled. She would need to call her brother to see if anything had happened to him and his family. She hoped that her family would believe her when she told them who she was.<br />
<br />
She needn&#39;t have worried so much because as soon as she got upstairs she saw that her parents had been transformed too. What&#39;s more she saw her sister-in-law, niece, nephew, and a woman who she thought had been her brother before being transformed. Dawn, who was floating above the couch and was transparent, looked at her as she came in and said, &quot;I suppose that you&#39;re Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick just stared at Dawn in shock for a moment. Then realizing that it was a logical assumption she nodded and said, &quot;I see we all changed except for Jasmine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did change,&quot; Jasmine said looking at Rick with a smile. &quot;I have a penis now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re both hermaphrodites now,&quot; Dawn said with a sigh. &quot;They also appear to be identical twins and share a mental link.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick nodded and took note of everyone&#39;s changes. Of course Dawn looked like a spirit or ghost, Jasmine looked exactly the same as far as she could see though she looked about eleven, Dan looked just like his sister now, her mother looked just about the same though she had a tail that was similar to her own, her father also looked about the same except he had dragonfly like wings on his back, and her brother or sister now who looked to be about eighteen with pale skin and black eyes. She seemed to be holding back from something and from the look on her face she was losing.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Rick&#39;s new sister came up off the couch right at her baring a pair of fangs. She barely had time to utter a surprised cry before her sister sunk her fangs into her neck. There were shouts for her to stop and her father attempted to pull her off as gently as he could. Rick had expected it to hurt but surprisingly there was only a slight pinching sensation and then pleasure filled her radiating from her new genitals. She could feel her blood being sucked out underneath pleasure but it didn&#39;t seem all that important. She just wanted to keep experiencing this pleasure which was growing. After a few minutes a shudder when through her and she let out a little moan. She figured that she had just experienced her first, and surely her last, female orgasm. At least she&#39;d die experiencing it. Just as she thought that her sister stopped feeding from her and leaned back with a little sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok Rick?&quot; her mom asked looking at her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m ok,&quot; Rick said as the pleasure quickly left leaving a little numb spot on her neck. She was a little woozy and weak but that was to be expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Rick&#39;s sister said, &quot;I couldn&#39;t help myself. You smelled so good. I&#39;m a monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick smiled and said, &quot;Well you didn&#39;t kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I could have if I hadn&#39;t gotten full,&quot; her sister said burying her head in her hands.<br />
<br />
Rick sighed and said, &quot;I remember hearing that most vampires don&#39;t need that much blood to survive. They usually only drain someone in preparation to turn them. Of course you will have those that enjoy killing people because they can and I doubt you&#39;re one of those vampires so you are not a monster. By the way what name should we call you by now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hadn&#39;t thought about it,&quot; her sister said shaking her head. &quot;How about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking about using Rikki,&quot; Rick said without hesitation. &quot;That&#39;s spelled r-i-k-k-i. It&#39;s what people have called me before just a different spelling. I won&#39;t have to learn to respond to a different name though I&#39;ll have to learn to write it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll go with Joanne,&quot; her sister said nodding a bit. &quot;It&#39;s close to my name at least. Though I would rather not have to be a woman. A vampire I could handle maybe but a woman is a bit much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it could be worse,&quot; Rikki said with a sly grin, &quot;you could have ended up as a living tampon, pad, or maybe diaper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan made a face at that and said, &quot;That isn&#39;t possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would have said what happened wasn&#39;t possible only this morning,&quot; Rikki said shaking her head. &quot;With what happened to us I&#39;d say anything is possible now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like there&#39;s news on it now,&quot; Dawn said nodding to the television.<br />
<br />
Indeed there was a woman on the screen though she looked like some type of alien. She had red and black mottled skin that looked like it might be a little rough. Her eyes were purple with vertical slits for pupils, well the eyes in her face anyway since she had about fifteen other eyes on stalks on her head that were different colors. Each of the eye stalks were turning and twisting in different directions. &quot;As many of you know at 11:59 PM UTC an unexplained phenomenon occurred,&quot; she said her voice light with a sing song quality to it. &quot;As far as officials and our own reporters can determine at this time this phenomenon has affected the majority of the world&#39;s population. As unbelievable as it may seem those affected have been transformed. The extent of the changes are unknown but they seem to run a wide gamut of possibilities, from small changes like eye color changing to major whole body changes like myself.&quot; She frowned and then raising her voice she said, &quot;I&#39;m still able to see you guys. Just because Debbie became a cake girl does not mean you can eat her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Carl,&quot; a voice called from offscreen.<br />
<br />
Carl sighed and continued her news piece with, &quot;There have been those that were transformed into inanimate objects as you just heard. Some of them seem to still be alive and aware because they are able to move and communicate. Others may or may not be alive or aware owing to the inability to communicate with them and their stillness. Perhaps in the coming days a way will be found to determine if they are still alive or not. In the meantime it is advised that you eat only what you personally know was food before this phenomenon occurred. Stay tuned for further updates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess that answers the question of whether or not anyone else was transformed,&quot; Rikki&#39;s mom said turning the volume down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder when they&#39;ll declare martial law,&quot; Rikki said shaking her head. Seeing the looks on everyone else&#39;s face she said, &quot;Well you know they will. Right now most people are in shock over their transformations. When that shock wears off law and order is going to go out the window. There will be those celebrating their transformation and there will be those that take advantage of their transformation. There will be fights and looting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we get to it,&quot; Rikki&#39;s dad said running a hand through his hair. His wings fluttered and he rose into the air a little bit before settling back down on the floor. That pretty much summed it up. It wasn&#39;t a question of if but of when.</p>
