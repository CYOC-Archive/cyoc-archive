<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just after the new mother took his child a young man entered the fair. He felt disgusted at how 'hillbillies' <br />
as he called them could parade their kids naked. Nevertheless he entered since he was looking for his brother. <br />
For you see this young man was non other than Liam Porter, young brother of Timothy. They had agreed to meet <br />
in this county carnival, but having looked all around, the only place left was that tent. He knew his brother <br />
had come, for he saw his convertible parked.<br />
<br />
When he entered the laughter had calmed giving the impression that the show was about to start. He didn't want <br />
to take a seat as the assistant told him. &quot;I'm just looking for someone.&quot; Liam just said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe we need another volunteer.&quot; said the manager in the middle of the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;He!&quot; pointed Madame at Liam.<br />
<br />
Liam was surprised, but quickly denied it. &quot;I'm sorry, I'm just looking for my brother.&quot; said as he tried to <br />
leave but the crowd of people pull him onto the stage. <br />
<br />
Liam Potter was a young graduate from highschool, he was wearing a salmon pink polo shirt, cargo shorts, <br />
expensive sandals, a hawaiian necklace. Dirty blonde hair in curls, tanned skin and green eyes, he was <br />
somewhat shorter than his average, but more built, he like wearing tight clothing to showcase his muscles, if <br />
he wore a shirt at all.<br />
<br />
Liam was a surfer and unlike his ambitious brother, he was ok to sit back and relax sucking on his father <br />
wealth. In fact he was coming from a surfing trip and his drunk friends left him in the motel they're staying, <br />
and his brother was giving him a lift.<br />
<br />
But that was before, know he was in the stage of Madame Ilusia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young man, what's your name?&quot; asked Madame.<br />
<br />
Liam didn't want to answer, seeing that his brother wasn't there, he wanted to leave. &quot;Liam Porter&quot; he <br />
responded, confused that he replied when he didn't meant to.<br />
<br />
The crowd devolved into a sea of whisper and chuckles.  Liam was confused, until Madame began speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another Porter we see, young Liam here however is not like his brother was... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was?!&quot; thought alarmed Liam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young Liam here was travelling with his pals, who in a drunken stupor left him with only what you see here. <br />
As good people we are she ought to help him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won't be necessary...&quot; said Liam a little afraid. <br />
<br />
&quot;He is a man that doesn't believe has it all, but that he should have it all given to him, when in reality he <br />
has nothing. Therefore my dear audience, since he has no real worth an auction would be of poor taste from my <br />
part.&quot; an uproar fill the tent, having grown into their particular amusement, but she raised her hand and the <br />
people went silent. &quot;HOWEVER, this young man want everything given, and that's not right, he doesn't truly <br />
have anything also. So my dear audience this young man shall purchase from YOU!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now not only Liam was confused but the audience also. &quot;But since he doesn't have anything he will have to <br />
exchange whatever he has now, however little it may be. For example, he has a long journey and we are simple <br />
people that while we might want to help couldn't take him all the way. He would have to walk. Who among here <br />
would trade his worn callous feet to this young man journey?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Walk? If you know where my brother is...&quot; started Liam.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will!&quot; yelled a retired fisherman who was visiting some relatives.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now come&quot; said Madame calling the old sea man into stage. &quot;Now, this good fellow is going to give you <br />
his callous, go on give him something, bargain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His callous feet! I don't-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you can't believe his charity, but it would be unpolite to turn him down. Now ask.&quot; said Madame.<br />
<br />
He wanted to protest but he felt strangely longing for those callous feet, to have the thickness of thousands <br />
of hours of work on his soles. &quot;May I buy your callous feet?&quot; he asked meekly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, in exchange give that nice pair of comfy sandals, you won't need them with these kind of feet.&quot; As Liam <br />
took of each sandals his feet became covered in a thick callous, his toenails became short, yellow and uneven, <br />
it looked like he had been walking barefoot his whole life. In exchange the sores that quell the old man every <br />
step became healed, his feet as tender and soft as they were in his youth.<br />
<br />
&quot;What next?&quot; asked Madame.<br />
<br />
A woman stood up and said. &quot;With hair and eyes like that people will know he isn't from here, criminals will <br />
target him instantly, I'll sell him my hair and eyes.&quot; said the woman with greasy black brown hair and brown <br />
eyes. &quot;In exchange I want his and his wallet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The price seems fair, cheap even.&quot; said Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal&quot; said Liam giving him his wallet. As soon as it changed hands his golden curls, straighten up and an <br />
unkeept mop of dark brown hair took their place, and his green eyes dulled down to common brown, the woman had <br />
to have some sight problem, since his vision was blurrier also.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, are you trying to rip me off kid?&quot; said the woman who had grown in beauty now with blonde hair and green <br />
eyes. &quot;There's only $5 in here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't have enough to go home so...&quot; tried to justify himself Liam, but the woman interrupt him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me your shirt, it looks expensive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on!&quot; yelled the now blond woman.<br />
<br />
Liam complied taking off his shirt for the woman, revealing his sculpted pecs and abs, but revealing also his <br />
pale white skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy you are whiter than wonderbread!&quot; said the woman taking his shirt and leaving the stage. For Liam only <br />
took his shirt off indoors or at night, he was odd for a surfer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Walking home with such pale skin would be dangerous, he could get sunburned. I'll exchange some of my dark <br />
color skin for that necklace and some muscle tone.&quot; said a brown latino woman.<br />
<br />
As Liam handed his necklace the woman grew paler, but just enough to get a caramel complexion and the <br />
definiton burned out some of her fat turning her into a latino bimbo. Meanwhile his muscles shrank into a <br />
regular built, all those hours at the gym just faded away, and the already somewhat tanned Liam turned skin <br />
brown. Even a tad darker than the woman originally were.<br />
<br />
Now aside from the face features no one could hope to recognize Liam just by looking at him a fact that <br />
certain young man took advantage of. <br />
<br />
&quot;Madame Illusia!&quot; called the young man whose father had bought so much from the previous auctions. &quot;I believe <br />
I have come up with a solution for our fellow here.&quot;  said the young man with the elocuency Liam's brother use <br />
to had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, lets hear it.&quot; said Madame<br />
<br />
&quot;Our friend here has a problem getting home, but to me the problem is that his house is too far away, and <br />
let's face it he doesn't look like he would be recognized even if he got there, so with the blessing of my <br />
father, he would rent him my old room, for a monthly fee, if the first payment is his name who will be ceded <br />
to me. Therefore removing all obstacles for him to go home, since the nearby rented room shall be in truth his <br />
only home.&quot; said the eloquent young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your plan is truly without flaw, young man. So Liam do you agree with him, I mean look at him. This handsome, <br />
intelligent, driven and polite young man strike me more as the proper son of the Porter family, than the <br />
barefoot, shirtless, almost wet-back impression that you strike me for. So do you accept the deal?&quot; said <br />
Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot; Liam deep down understand that if he agree he will be tossing aside his own identity and any chance of <br />
rescue he still has, and for what? A small room in a likely run down house, not even that just the deposit for <br />
said room. But even deeper he had a desire to settle in that room no matter the cost, even one as great as <br />
that one, Liam slowly said. &quot;..I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
No physical change or otherwise. The young man simply said. &quot;Thank you Mr. O'Brian, you help me, care and <br />
believe in me when no one had, for that I'm forever grateful, and you shall always be in my heart, as my true <br />
father. Please take care of this out of his luck young man, and remember that you have a friend in Liam <br />
Porter. As do you Madame on which I pleas adieu to you.&quot; With that the young man who became Liam Porter left <br />
the tent among the applausse of the people.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's very touching but we still have the issue of our friend here, who is as about now nameless, with only <br />
those shorts as his only material possession remaining, as such I don't believe he could afford the first <br />
month of rent, no matter how low the cost Mr. O'Brian put it.&quot; said Madame. &quot;Our friend here needs a job and a <br />
name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll sell him a name.&quot; said a teen boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now ask him.&quot; said Madame to the now unnamed Liam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you sell me a name?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What else is yours to give as a payment?... I don't like hand-me-downs, but those are some sweet slacks. Give <br />
them to me and I'll give you a new name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'll be naked... I won't have anything left...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you'll have a name, and that's really important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... you are right.&quot; said ex-Liam undoing his pants, giving away his last possession.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother's new name is Leroy, you shall be Milton.</p>
