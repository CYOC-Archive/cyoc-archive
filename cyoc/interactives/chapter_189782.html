<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miss. Summers body began to pulse and she immediately grabbed her stomach as it growled and groned. She watched in surprise as her belly bloated outward and swelled! Cradling the growth it blows into a tout round orb as though she&#39;d just esperienced 9 months of pregnancy in under 15 seconds! Her breasts were not as lucky, they retained their small A cup size, much to Miss.Summers dissapintment. <br />
<br />
She breathed heavily as the orb began to shift color going from her soft tan cream tone to a pastel lime that radiated across her skin. <br />
<br />
In the mirror she noticed her eyes. They looked bigger. They were bigger? They were still growing bigger. Her eyes bulged larger and larger pressing the bridge of her nose thinner until the whites of both her eyes collided and like oil in water &#39;plopped&#39; togther forming one great big cyclopean eye within her head, nose compleatly erased. <br />
<br />
The purple shifted from a circle to a rectangle like that of a goat and watching this in the mirror Miss. Summers as aware of the other facial changes. Somewhere along the lines her ears had vanished and hair recessed leaving her bald! Except for the almost cartoonishly long eyelashes that formed around her eye. <br />
<br />
Her neck had also vanished! Sinking into her torso her mouth now stationed at the base of her collor bone. It too looked funny? It&#39;s lips losing their plumpness and to growths perturbing from their corners! Flesh little tendrils draped about two or three inches from her top lip reminiscent of a catfish&#39;s whiskers. She realized she was now smelling the air from the odd organ. Stranger yet was her tougne she opened her fish like mouth and saw another tendril like organ reach out about a foot. Her mouth now lacked teeth but the organ that replaced her tougne came equipped with a functional mouth like her original.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; She said aloud through the new mouth, with as much her same voice as before.<br />
<br />
Almost as strange as her new mouth she saw her eye moving upward! A collum of flesh was streaching upward beneath her eye rasing it up off her shoulders by 1...2...3 feet! Her eye was now taller then she ever was by at least a head and a half! <br />
<br />
She now became aware of her hands feeling something cold on their palms she looked down with her new eyestalk and was puzzled to find her arms still cradling her pregnant like belly. Looking further still at where she could feel the cold sensation she saw that somehow she had grown a second pair of arms from her shoulders! <br />
<br />
They were long and lankyrwaching with a slight bow at the elbows all the way to the ground at her feet.. Alien like in their thinness except for her palms that seemed to buldge halfway up to her forearms. The fingers of which there were only three of and a thumb acting like a heel were ridged and tips pressed flat sucker cups, clearly these hands were made for walking. <br />
<br />
She saw her original hands had changed now too. They had undergone a simaler transformation to her new hands they to bulges at the mid forarm to palm and she had only two alien like fingers and thumb, minus the flat fingertips. All her hands now lacked fingernails too.<br />
<br />
But her still she felt her new arms supporting her weight but she was still standing. Her eye arched and craned about looking down at her wrist to see it almost vanish into three blobs. She almost mistook them for ass cheeks but looking close it baca me more evident that her legs had drastically changed as well. <br />
<br />
Her flat butt had swelled out both cheeks merging into one mass. As did her legs at the thighs her legs had extended twice their length and lost their bones in place of packed elastic muscle! Her knees losing all definition and feet becoming shapeless as she lifted what used to be her left foot up over he belly. Her shoes still at the (now clearly) tentical&#39;s tip. The mound that used to be her ass had also grown into such a tentical leaving her with three 6-7foot long tenticals beneath her bulging stomach!<br />
<br />
Her last pressing concern was what else was below her legs? The who experience had been very arousing! The fascination of the changes had captured her attention, but she was aware of the mosenimg of her feminin folds between her legs. <br />
<br />
Stripping a tentical of its shoe, she arched it up between her tentical&#39;s convergence point, where she still felt her wet pussy. Through the new limb she could feel the damp female juices saturating her folds. There was however somthing extra! As she played with herself, she felt a rush of power and excitement. From within her folds another organ or limb was emerging growing from deep inside her stretching longer and thicker like another tentical but more ridged and stiff! As it unfolded it arced out before her matching the curve of her belly and though she&#39;d never known the sensation of an male erection, let alone one of this size she knew she now had a gigantic cock. Only able too see its tip and feel its tight ridged shaft with her once-leg-now-tentical she could see it was clover shaped as though a cock 3 feet long had tried to split into four and stopped half way.<br />
<br />
The finel occurrence to take place was a spattering of hair. Body hair to be precise. To Miss. Summers who diligently and proudly groomed her body regularly was set aback by the lavender hairs that sprouted on her shoulder, the backs of her bulbous forearm-palms, under belly and around her neathers between her 3 tentical&#39;s basses. What started as fine hairs quickly became thick lushes lavender colored pelt against her pastel green skin. <br />
<br />
Jenniferhad watched mouth agap at the obscenity that had just took place. through the mirror she had seen a kind of flash cross Miss. Summers eye, something had happened but Jen wasn&#39;t sure what that flash was. <br />
<br />
Miss. Summers looked herself over once more, all the changes done and looked back at the egg.  She took it in two of her new tenticals and looked it over. &quot;Huh...&quot; She said aloud. &quot;Nothing happened... Did Prinncess Jen lay a dud?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was puzzled. Did Miss. Summers knot know she&#39;d changed? She&#39;d watched her wonderment at the transformation. The pill! It must have made her think she was always a...uhm...weird... creature... person.<br />
Jen caught a glance at Carmen who over the stall was still slack jawed from the spectical. That must have been it! <br />
<br />
Miss. Summers was the only person who didn&#39;t know she had transformed!</p>
