<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(This is an alternate version of the original story titled &quot;Concealed&quot;. I made it as the idea spurted in my mind, and since the two have fairly similar premises, I decided to put them in the same bundle. This could lead to some characters being similar. I have a warning though, this version will be more centered about violent elements, painful experiences, mental trauma  and some other things of sorts. Please be aware as you venture forth. Good reading ;)<br />
<br />
I feel sore all over... Everything feels dizzy... I try to recall anything, but only flashes comes to my mind... An accident... sirens... alarms... blood.... and pain. The pressure of the air seems like it holds me down from any movement, a powerful force. I manage to flutter my eyes open at once, but the simple act is already unbearably difficult to enact. Like it wasn&#39;t bad enough, I&#39;m welcomed with a blinding light, making me recede slightly from my action. I seem to in a room, the ceiling being of a color close to something I could qualify as a blueish-white. <br />
<br />
As I roll my head to the right, strange tension ripples through me, and I lay it on the side. A window opens right in the wall I&#39;m looking at, but I see nothing past is, as if it was covered in a black sheet on the other side. The wall is bland and white, completely bare if we don&#39;t count the fenestra. Turning my sight to my left was even harder than the first time, but I managed. Rows of beds seem to extend from my where I lay. In fact, I start to make sense of my position, as the cushiony feeling below me hint at my presence in a bed. All the walls are colored the same, and the bed sheets are as blue as the ceiling. The room feels bland and poorly decorated, as excepting for the beds, no furniture seems to be present. I do notice some peculiar instruments next to some beds, bags of blue and yellow liquid lifted on poles as well as a few tubes coming out of them. I remember seeing these before... but I don&#39;t remember where... <br />
<br />
I try to lift myself up, but a arching ache hold me to do so. I have to wait multiple longing minutes before even managing to find a sitting position, my body feeling numb and heavy.  Now that I am in a more adequate posture, I get a better look at my surroundings. A few lights were encased in the roof of the chamber I find myself in, like the one that is right above me. There are a total of eight beds, four on the other side of the room, three next to mine, and obviously the one that I am residing in right now, that is in the far corner of the room. I spot a door after the two allignement of beds. I get it now, I&#39;m in a hospital room, and the bags on sticks are called IV bags, made for infusion and such... The real question would be WHY am I in a hospital room? I don&#39;t remember anything...<br />
<br />
I take a look down, and gets the first look at my body. I seem to be covered in a bunch of bandages poorly installed over me, as if done in a rush. Most of them have bloody spots, and the pain I get from them hint at the fact that they serve their purpose... This blood is mine. I am also wearing a comically large lab coat of sorts on me. It barely covers any of my skin and the cool air of the room sends a shivers down my spine. I lift my hand to feel my anatomy, but try to avoid touching any of the blood spots, scared of hurting my potential wounds below. My other hand join in to explore my features, they all seems to familiar and unknown at the same time...<br />
<br />
I stopped when I touched my mouth, or at least where it should be. The fabric of bandages are pressing hard against my jaw, and the moment my right hand reached that point, a jolt of pain surprised me. The wraps cover my whole mouth area, but for some reason, I don&#39;t seem to suffocate through it. I try to speak, but a strange wall right before responce is the only thing I hit. I start to panic, the instinctive actions of breathing through my mouth and speaking were missing, trying to achive them only hurts. My hands tremble as I strech my them to try to remove the bandages. They stick slightly at me as I peel them off, once again stinging of suffering. <br />
<br />
As I finally takes the last out of it, I lower my eyes to were my mouth should be, but there is only a gaping hole. A fleshy, charred and tortured wound. The scent of blood and meat fills my noise as the sight makes my eyes roll back. I almost fainted at the sight. I quickly placed back the bandages around it, extremely careful as to not hurt me more than I already am. My whole lower jaw is missing, as well as the orifice that comes with it. I can&#39;t talk, I never will anymore. It hurts so bad... I try to remember, but I can&#39;t... Will I never experience speech? Or remember a time when I could have? I sense tears well up as I embark in a silent mourning, sobs and cries impossible for me...<br />
<br />
After a while, I manage to compose myself, my eyes still wet from my weeping. I have to understand where I am, find someone, get help or instruction. What happened to me? Why am I here? I need responces to these questions. I roll to the side of the bed, and place my bare feet on the cold ground, on after the other. I ready myself, and push to a standing pose. I almost feel down, but managed to hang onto the adjacent bed from the one that I woke up in. My legs feels wobbly and weak, and they threaten to give out under my weight. I look at the massively oversized coat that reaches my knees, rest on my measily shoulders heavily but leave the front of my body to the sight. It looks ridiculous on me, but being the only piece of clothing I have excepting my bandages, I decide to keep it, no matter how inconvenient it is. <br />
<br />
I try again to let go off the bed, this time with a bit more success, but I still feel unsteady on my feet. I take a daring step to the side, and clumsily draw my other close to it. I stumble this way carefully until I reach the door, almost praying for it to not be locked. To my relief, the knob turns seemlessly as I place my palm on it, revealing the outside of my hospital room. A long corridor extends to my right and my left to what it seems like infinity. I can&#39;t find the end of them with a first look. <br />
<br />
I get out, slowly close the door behind me, and decide to head left, one of my hand still hugging the wall to keep me steady as I start my walk. The eerie atmosphere is only complimented with an unnatural silence flowing the halls. I can sometime make out the buzzing sound of machinerie in the walls, but other then that, it was pure nothingness. I can often fing windows on the outer wall from mine, but they are all in the same black state as the one in my room. Doors are also common, but I can&#39;t help but fear what they might hide, so I just continue past them. <br />
<br />
Anxiety started to settle in, my heart raced and wondered. The repetitions of the same layouts making me anxious. Was I running in circles? I lost counts of the turns I made, and the time that passed. My legs hurts from all the work they have to endure. Where is everybody? An hospital is supposed to have staff, patients, visitors... But there&#39;s no one... I peeked in a few doors, only to find lifeless and empty rooms once again... Am I lost? I don&#39;t know... I don&#39;t care... I just want someone to see me... I just want to be found... I don&#39;t want to die...<br />
<br />
Then, a voice echoed in the hallway. It was small, far, but still noticeable. I quickened my paced, almost falling under my frail legs. The voice turned into chatters, and the chatters turned into conversations. There are people. I&#39;m getting closer, I&#39;m almost running when I find the source, a door absolutely large compared to the others. The color is also different, as instead of a cold white, it is brown. I take the handle and turn it.<br />
<br />
???: When I tell you that I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening! This place is so weird and its ruining my hair! So please stop leeching boy! I have a boyfriend you know?<br />
<br />
???: I&#39;m not- *Sigh* I&#39;m not leeching! I&#39;m trying to figure something out! We&#39;re all lost in this strange place, and I&#39;m trying to find a god damn solution!<br />
<br />
???: Guys... stop fighting please... It&#39;s not helping...<br />
<br />
???: I&#39;ll fight If I want to! Beside, it&#39;s lady egoist over here that don&#39;t want to cooperate!<br />
<br />
???: Since when I&#39;m the egoist here?!<br />
<br />
???: Gang, concentrating on the task at hand is primordial, so refraining to accusate each other would be preferable.<br />
<br />
???: Yeah everybody, let&#39;s all try to figure this out!<br />
<br />
???: Wait. Who the fuck is that?<br />
<br />
The guy who just talked pointed at me, and all their gaze riveted onto me. The sudden attention made my stomach take a turn, and I receded from the entrance a bit. They are a lot in there, at least a dozen. My heart starting to beat fast as they all looked at me, hiding behind the door.<br />
<br />
???: W-Who are you?<br />
<br />
???: Don&#39;t ask a question like that! She clearly is another of us! Look how she seems scared!<br />
<br />
???: Hey here. Are you okay? Don&#39;t be scared, we won&#39;t hurt you.<br />
<br />
The woman who just spoke out had approached the door, her sweet words not enough to reassure me of the safety of the situation. I hadn&#39;t thought of the potential danger that finding people could imply before seeing them. They all are covered in hospital gowns of sorts, mostly differing from my measly adornment. I can see some that have the same type of coat, but at least theirs fits their size...<br />
<br />
???: Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re all as lost as you. We found ourselves lost here... until we found each other here. Do you want to come in?<br />
<br />
She reached out her hand in a delicate and inviting matter, I feel compelled to accept her request, but the others all had suspicous look on their face. I tentatively join my arm with her&#39;s, and she gently leaded me inside where the others waited.<br />
<br />
???: How many of us are there? We&#39;re at how many now... eleven? Twelve?<br />
<br />
???: We seem to be a total of ten members with the newest inclusion. And our situation still is precarious.<br />
<br />
???: M-maybe... *huff* maybe we should get aqquainted... *puff*?<br />
<br />
???: Shut up slut.<br />
<br />
???: She&#39;s got a point, maybe we should present ourselves to each other before doing anything else.<br />
<br />
The scenerie of the room is very peculiar. All the others are sitting or standing on multiple places in the room, which seems to be some kind of waiting room. There is a bitchy looking teenager girl checking her nails on one of the chairs, a tall slender man with glasses leaning agaist the back wall, a small teenage looking guy all worked up standing in the middle, a girl seemingly... doing some inappropriate movement in the corner... to say the least, a REALLY tall girl sitting on another chair, trying to take less place than she already is taking, the mature woman still holding my hand by the door, a thug like dude somehow smoking and slacking off in a side, another girl with excentric clothing and eyes that makes me uncomfortable, a small girl fiddling with her hair, and finally me, looking at all of this with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
???: So... who starts?<br />
<br />
???: Start what?<br />
<br />
???: I-I though we were about to present ourselves...<br />
<br />
???: Yeah right...<br />
<br />
They gave each other awkward glances, until the intelligent looking man with glasses spoke up.<br />
<br />
Terry: I can start. My name is Terry Miller, neurophysician of experience. I&#39;ve worked in a grand governemental building of research and scientific discoveries for quite a while now. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve had an accident following a wrongful experiment. I found myself brought to a hospital in no time. It this strange, as after a few days bedbound, I woke up in a totally different place, being a chamber in this bizarre building. I have no idea how I might have been relocated here, as I swear nothing was planed for my case before the next week.<br />
<br />
???: What was the accident?<br />
<br />
He said nothing, but lifted the shirt of his gown to reveal a large ugly scar on his stomach, the skin around it not the same color as the rest.<br />
<br />
Terry: I got skewered. None of my vital organs got damaged, but it took a while for my body to accept the skin transplant. It&#39;s getting better thought, and I was supposed to get out of the hospital soon, but I guess fate decided otherwise...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Courtney: My name&#39;s Courtney Taylor, I know, I know, but I don&#39;t sign autographs. You probably know it already, but I am a renowned influencer with more than a million followers on tiktok! And unless you&#39;re uncultured, you know my world wide knewn hit song &quot;Me and my mirror&quot; *Giggle*. I came in the hospital to get some breast enhancements! The viewers love it!<br />
<br />
It is true that her body did seem to not have its natural look, as some places like the butt and breasts did seem to move unnaturally. Also, her lips are very obviously botoxed.<br />
<br />
Courtney: The plastic surgery worked but obviously they told me to stay in the room for a few more hours! I swear doctors are a bunch of incompetents. And now I&#39;m stuck in that weird place with a bunch of degenerates.<br />
<br />
???: Who are you calling degenerate?!? I&#39;m gonna make you swallow back those words!<br />
<br />
???: Plastic... surgery... sorry I never quite understood it...<br />
<br />
Courtney: Obviously a girl like you wouldn&#39;t understand darling! You appearance tells all.<br />
<br />
???: O-oh... If you say so...<br />
<br />
???: Don&#39;t let this bitch take hold that easily! She doesn&#39;t deserve an ounce of fucking respect!<br />
<br />
Terry: Now, now... no need to quarrel. What&#39;s you name anyway?<br />
<br />
The teenage guy was clenching his fists out of rage over Courtney&#39;s attitude. It is true that respcet should be primordial, especially in this situation, but I do wonder what got him so worked up about it...<br />
<br />
Logan: I&#39;m Logan... I was sudying at my highschool before getting a slight fracture to the wrist. I guess you can guess what happened after, as I woke up in a room here instead of the usual hospital room I rested in beforehand. <br />
<br />
Courtney: Ha! You&#39;re here for a sprained wrist! You can&#39;t be more pitiful boy!<br />
<br />
Logan: Shut up you bitch! You&#39;re here for far worst reasons!<br />
<br />
Heather: G-guys... please stop arguing... I can introduce myself if you want? My name is... I mean... I&#39;m Heather... Heather Laurent... I worked as a maid for a long while before... I... I served a pretty rich family in france... But didn&#39;t get paid very well... I-I guess that you can tell that I&#39;m not  really good at talking... I got hospitalized because of an... a-accident I had when I visited my family in the USA... I don&#39;t really understand how I&#39;ve... I mean... how I got here...<br />
<br />
A maid? She doesn&#39;t look like someone that could fit well as a french maid working in a manor... Most maids are small, and depending on the case, got some curves at least, but she is taller than most in this room... Wouldn&#39;t it be inconvenient to have a maid that takes that much space? Maybe I&#39;m overthinking it.<br />
<br />
???: What kind of accident?<br />
<br />
Heather: I-I... I don&#39;t r-really like t-to talk about it...<br />
<br />
Courtney: Probably nothing interesting...<br />
<br />
Logan: Can you shut up?! For ten fucking minutes!? Is it too much to ask?!<br />
<br />
Courtney: Yes, it&#39;s too much to ask from you to me... boy.<br />
<br />
Before things escalate any further, the woman who led me in, released my hand a started to talk.<br />
<br />
Florence: Well, my own name is Florence Campbell, a opera singer from australia! I moved to america as well to try to hit the main stream! But I soon found out that I had a chronic legs malfunction, and soon enough, I found myself unable to stand... I was stuck in a wheel chair. Recently I decided to go for a risky surgery to walk again, and it mostly worked as you can see! But I still have some difficulty... I hope you don&#39;t mind giving me a hand from time to time!<br />
<br />
I look down at her legs, and indeed, they do tremble, even thought it is barely noticeable at first glance. I heard a whimper coming from the corner of the room, where the strange woman was still touching herself... sensually to say the least. She didn&#39;t stop since I first entered the room, and she is still going at it, a hand between her legs, and the other rubbing every part of herself.<br />
<br />
Courtney: Oh yeah. I forgot about the sex machine over here. Do you mind presenting yourself or your cunt will do it for yourself? Since it seem more communicative.<br />
<br />
Jezabel: I&#39;m... *Huff* I&#39;m Jezabel... Harlot... I&#39;m sorry... *Moan* I can&#39;t stop... *Puff* I was born like that... *Whimper* Since puberty it didn&#39;t stop growing... *Moan* They say they... *Huff* can&#39;t do anything, That... *Puff* they don&#39;t understand why my libido is like that! *Moan* But for every passing moments I need more! *MOAN* MOre! Oh I&#39;m so sorry... It&#39;s humiliating... I should not... But I can&#39;t control my hands anymore... <br />
<br />
This might be the strangest thing I&#39;ve seen in my life. I&#39;m not sure, since I don&#39;t remember a lot before waking up, but someone can&#39;t have a sex drive so high that they can&#39;t control themselves right? That&#39;s not possible right?<br />
<br />
Courtney: Excuses! You&#39;re just saying that to get off in front of everyone! You&#39;re just a slut and won&#39;t admit it!<br />
<br />
Jezabel: N-No! I sweaaaAAAN!<br />
<br />
Some clear liquid splashed on the ground below her. Thinking that she would stop after orgasm is too much to ask, as she restart her machination. Tears prickle down her cheeks, clearly not feeling great about her exposure.<br />
<br />
Courtney: Ew... Gross.<br />
<br />
Florence: Courtney dear! You shouldn&#39;t mock other&#39;s... conditions! No matter what they include!<br />
<br />
Courtney: Still gross.<br />
<br />
Sob joined the cacophony of sounds that comes out of the poor girl. The distress on her face palpable over the torment that she is living. She probably went to the hospital to get this checked... but from what I&#39;ve heard, there is nothing to do. The small girl on the chair seemed to be... strangely invested in what just happened, while almost everybody in the room were looking away.<br />
<br />
Amber: I&#39;m Amber! It&#39;s nice to meet you all! I&#39;m fourteen year old and went to school before coming here! My mom told me we went to the hospital to do some arrengements... I don&#39;t really know what she meant, but she said it had something to do with my long hair or something!<br />
<br />
Florence: What do you mean by it has something to do with you long hair?<br />
<br />
Amber: Well... she always says that I would be better off as a girl and all... that&#39;s why she always put the pills in my drink! She call them hormones or something... I don&#39;t really know why she say all of that, but I think she just doesn&#39;t understand that I&#39;m a boy!<br />
<br />
... A boy? There is absolutely no way... She&#39;s... I mean... He has fairly large breasts, long flowy hair, a HUGE butt and pinched waist. There is no way right? At fourtheen, he really passes as the perfect teen girl! Maybe he meant that he identify as a boy? But even then... If you look closely... you can see a bulge in his pants?! What did his mom do?<br />
<br />
Logan: Your... your mom did what?!<br />
<br />
Amber: She puts the pills in my drink? She never told me what they do... But she compliments me on how pretty I look all the time because of them, so I guess they&#39;re good!<br />
<br />
Terry:... She really...? I mean... Fine. No this is not fine... What the actual fuck?!<br />
<br />
Amber: You guys are so weird...<br />
<br />
???: HEh! You&#39;re mom got taste!<br />
<br />
The smoking man finally got his eyeballs to divert to something else than the ceiling and participated in the conversation for the first time, only to make a flirting move on a 14 year old! I would&#39;ve gagged if I could.<br />
<br />
Logan: What the fuck dude? <br />
<br />
???: What? I can&#39;t flirt a bit? We&#39;re all gonna die here anyway! So might as well live my life the fullest!<br />
<br />
Terry: What are you trying to insinuate by &quot;We&#39;re all gonna die here&quot;?<br />
<br />
Kyle: You never watched horror movies man? Ten people stuck in a unknown environment with no exterior communication... It&#39;s the classic thriller! Soon enough, a masked guy with a chainsaw&#39;s gonna murder us all! Oh, and I&#39;m Kyle by the way.<br />
<br />
Terry: I am questionning your view of life thoroughly right now...<br />
<br />
Kyle: Heh! I get that often. But that wont stop me from trying to pull up the girls!<br />
<br />
Courtney: You&#39;re disgusting.<br />
<br />
I look around the room, scanning for any other person that did not introduce themselves yet. My gaze stopped at the sight of a girl with wide eyes, and a maniacal grin crossing her face. She gives me a side eyes that sends shivers of fear through my skin. <br />
<br />
???: Hihihehe... You&#39;re all so cute... Making friends when we&#39;re all about to die...<br />
<br />
Logan: Who asked?<br />
<br />
Selene: I go by lots of names... But my parents titled me with Selene at birth... A name I couldn&#39;t chose... like fate... I got here because of fate... They told me that I was mentally ill or something *giggle* What might they be talking about?<br />
<br />
Courtney: Of course. The slut, the pervert and the psycho, who would have thought? My situation can&#39;t get any worse than this right?<br />
<br />
Logan: IT&#39;S NOT JUST ABOUT YOU FOR GOD&#39;S SAKE! We&#39;re all into this! Whatever the circumstances might be!<br />
<br />
Florence: We&#39;re an odd bunch for sure... but let&#39;s still try to figure things out.<br />
<br />
Selene: And the little masked girl? Might I know more?<br />
<br />
Their glances returned to me after all of this, expecting me to speak up for once. But I can&#39;t, I simply can&#39;t. Selene stood up of her seat and jumped to me. Her piercing eyes staring right into my soul. I try to run, my own eyes filled with terror, but I get backed off in a corner. I try to push and scream, but she&#39;s too strong and I&#39;m too weak... <br />
<br />
Selene: What is it? Cat got your tongue? I just want to see!<br />
<br />
Florence: Selene what are you doing!? Leave her alone!<br />
<br />
Heather: Y-yeah leave her be...<br />
<br />
Logan: You crazy bitch! Get off of her!<br />
<br />
She ignored them, as she took out the last bit of protection from my lower face, I felt the tingling of the cold air on my exposed flesh. Gasps filled the room and Selene quickly put it back. Her crazy look now filled with dread at the sight she just had. The sudden and undelicat change of placement of the bandages made a throbbing pain appear on my wound, my eyes closing and my face getting paler by the second. I take deep breaths through my nose and try to gain back some composure, as the rest of the group looks at me in awe.<br />
<br />
Amber: Oh my god... Are you okay?<br />
<br />
He looked into my eyes as he said these words. I nodded weakly as the pain started to subside bit by bit.<br />
<br />
