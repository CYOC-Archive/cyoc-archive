<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stacy stepped out from the portal that Charles had made and was stunned at what she saw. She had seen her boyfriend as an angel before when her grandmother died but to be standing in Heaven was another thing. <br />
<br />
In truth, she didn’t really like it all that much. It was far too white, too much marble in her view and the garden she was standing in while beautiful didn’t have a natural feel. Yes, the sight of the flying angels, the gold and silver mesh in with the pure white marble was extremely beautiful but she was a women who found beauty in climbing a mountain side, hiking down a trail in the early morning and rafting down a river with ancient red rock cliffs on either side. That was heaven to her, not this but Charles had told her that like on Earth there was countryside outside the cities in heaven and he had said they were grander and more beautiful then the ones on Earth. She couldn’t wait to see those. <br />
<br />
Charles stepped though behind her taking his angel form as four blue wings appeared on his back, he grew in size by at least a foot and a half and want from a good-looking young man to a man who would put models to shame. <br />
<br />
“Charles!” Yelled a voice as both Charles and Stacy turned to see a beautiful angel with auburn hair tied back in a ponytail. She was beautiful, with made Stacy feel a little self conscious as this unknown women embraced her boyfriend…correction soon to be husband before giving him multiple kisses on the cheeks. The angel had four pure snow-white wings coming out of her back and was dressed in robes but robes tight enough to show off one hell of a figure.<br />
<br />
“Celine.” Said Charles as the women, Celine looked at him before noticing Stacy.<br />
<br />
“Oh…sorry, my bad where are my manners.” said the women as she bowed her head and then began to speak in what had to be French, something Stacy only had a rough understanding of.<br />
<br />
“She doesn’t speak French, Celine.” stated Charles <br />
<br />
“She doesn’t?” inquired Celine, clearly offended before speaking to Charles in French again. <br />
<br />
“I can speak Cherokee if that makes you feel better about me. So if you are going to talk about me do it in a way we can all understand.” countered Stacy showing more then a little sash toward this women. She expected the women to take offense but instead she smiled.<br />
<br />
“I take back what I said, mom is going to love her.” Said Celine. “She definitely has the stones to stand up to mom and she loves that.”<br />
<br />
“Stacy, meet Celine Morningstar one of my sisters.” Introduced Charles as Stacy mentally hit herself, looking at the two of them now they were clearly siblings. <br />
<br />
“Priestess.” corrected Celine “I am Priestess Celine Morningstar. I can’t wait to help you become an angel and welcome you into the family.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, sorry for being rude earlier.” Apologized Stacy<br />
<br />
“Please, we are the children of Joan of Arc, we live off rebellion.” Laughed Celine “Infact our little sister is currently grounded.”<br />
<br />
“What did she do?” inquired Charles as Stacy raised an eyebrow. “We have only one other siblings, Abrielle and she is only 14 and so she is even more rebellious then normal.”<br />
<br />
“So and some other younger angles went down to Earth and played some “pranks” on humans.” Stated Celine “Mostly faking alien abduction on sleeping humans? I don’t know why they think that is funny, but they do.” <br />
<br />
“So how does this work?” inquired Stacy<br />
<br />
“Well, you have to take a walk.” Stated Celine as Stacy looked at her confused before she was lead toward a small chapel with a large pool in it. There, flanked by multiple statues she was told she had to walk through the water and she would be transformed. <br />
<br />
“Come to us human, leave your mortal body behind and join the skies of heaven.” Proclaimed Celine as she stood at the far end of the pool.<br />
<br />
“Here, we go.” Said Stacy to herself as she began to walk into the water, she almost jumped when the water suddenly became engulfed in flames, but the flames didn’t hurt as she kept moving.<br />
<br />
At the far end of the pool, Charles stood waiting to see Stacy come out of the pool, to see what sort of angel she would become. She was such a remarkable woman, unlike anyone he had ever met, he knew she was going to be something even more special as an angle.<br />
He wasn’t wrong. <br />
<br />
He was confused at first, the first thing to come out of the water wasn’t Stacy’s hair or even the tips of her wings. Instead a pair of silver antlers, thin and elegant, began to emerge from the water, next came the tips of pitch black wings. Black wings weren’t uncommon but these where dark as night, then came Stacy’s face.<br />
<br />
Her face was far more elegant and beautiful, her dark eyes transformed into pure silver which seamed to glow. Her hair was pitch black as well but to his amazement, it was moving. Not as in it was alive but across her long black hair was tiny points of silver as if her hair was made of stars. Her breasts had expanded as well, her frame thin yet extremely athletic, every scar was gone from her skin but her tattoo of a peace sign with several native American symbols remained on her upper arm. She stepped out of the pool, her pitch-black wings actually touching the ground. <br />
<br />
Most wings, went from about head height to kneecap, even when it came to ones with multiple sets of wings. Stacy’s wings went up to the tips of her silver antlers which had to be at least 10 feet up to around her ankles. Charles had never seen wings like that before, as Stacy stretched the wings. They had to be raven wings but like her hair, there was moving points of silver on the wings. Extended they almost looked like watching a meteor shower on a clear night. She flapped her wings and actually lifted off the ground, newly formed angels aren’t suppose to be able to fly, their wings are too weak yet Stacy lifted off the ground with ease.<br />
<br />
Then her halo formed, which was odd. Her halo formed above her head like every other angel but it was a sort of semi see through silver which actually attached to her antlers.<br />
<br />
“Wow…” said Charles. <br />
<br />
“This feels amazing.” Stated Stacy as she studied herself, she moved one of her hands only to see purplish energy gathering around her hand. “Cool.”<br />
<br />
“Oh….” said Celine taken aback, she hadn’t seen an angel like this before. Some angels had animal like traits, but this was different. Another priestess was clearly taken aback as well as it took an extra moment before they came up with a robe to cover Stacy. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” said Stacy as the priestess went toward Celine. <br />
<br />
“Get the head priestess.” Ordered Celine as Stacy looked at her confused as the Priestess took off in nearly a run.<br />
<br />
“Is something wrong?” inquired Stacy<br />
<br />
“In a way, I have never seen an angle like you before.” Stated Celine as she looked at her brother who was clearly worried. <br />
<br />
“Neither have I.” confirmed Charles which really got Stacy worried.<br />
<br />
Another angel came running in only to stop when she saw Stacy.<br />
<br />
“By the light.” Said the older priestess as she walked over and began to study Stacy.<br />
<br />
“Headmistress, I have never seen…” started Celine<br />
<br />
“I have only seen one because until this moment there has only been one other who had wings like this and the moving stars in her hair and wings.” Stated the Priestess before looking at Charles “I should have known that you would pick a special woman to become an angel, your father picked your mother who graced our skies with her eight wings and you…”<br />
<br />
She turned and looked at Stacy looking at her in stunned silence.<br />
<br />
“You’re a Custodia Ordins.” proclaimed the Priestess<br />
<br />
“A what?” inquired Stacy, even the other angels looked confused.<br />
<br />
“Custodia Ordinis… a guardian of order, a very special angel, there has only been one in all of history.” Stated the Priestess “She left us long ago but her memory lives on in the form of mother nature.”<br />
<br />
“Mother nature?” inquired Stacy with a laugh. “That is kind of funny considering my background, an environmental activist turned into an angel of mother nature.” <br />
<br />
“No…you don’t understand, the last one, the one who inspired mother nature was God’s own mother. She saved your father, Charles and Celine and his siblings from Chaos when they where little kids. I think Lucifer built her a shrine in Hell in her memory.” Stated the Priestess as everyone’s eyes widened. “When she died sealing away chaos she prophesied that one day, her powers would return and now you’re here.”<br />
<br />
“Aren’t there rumors about chaos being unleashed in hell recently?” inquired Celine as the Priestess nodded.<br />
<br />
“We have to inform the council of this at once, this changes everything.” Confirmed the Priestess. “Both Heaven and Hell need to be made aware of this.”</p>
