<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie was playing over at the neighbor's house when the phone rang. Listening, she heard her best friend's mom pick it up and then after hanging it up, the woman turned to Katie and said, &quot;That was your mom. She says that you should spend the night here with Dustin and Maggie. Well, if that's the case I had better set an extra plate,&quot; and then turning, she left, probably to finishing making dinner.<br />
<br />
Looking at Maggie, Katie was about to say something when her friend said, &quot;Your mom can be really weird sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie grinned at this and replied, &quot;You have no idea,&quot; thinking how her mother had sent them all off...Darla, Karen and her...to friends homes when Denise had turned thirteen.<br />
<br />
Giggling, Maggie said, &quot;Come on,&quot; and led the other girl up to her room to play.<br />
-------<br />
<br />
After dinner Maggie wanted to play some more, but she also wanted Dustin to join in. A year younger, the boy sometimes joined in, but only after a lot of convincing...something that proved to be much easier when there where two eight year old girls rather then one.<br />
<br />
Grinning, Dustin went to his room and returning wearing a footed pyjama, he said, &quot;I want to be your puppy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maggie nodded and said this was a good idea...for the moment. Thinking it over, Katie jumped up and said, &quot;Be right back,&quot; and took off out of the room, down the steps, out the back door and toward her house...missing by just a few minutes her sisters and mother's transformation.<br />
<br />
Inside her house, Katie headed toward Darla's room, knowing that she was supposed to keep out, but not caring at the moment because of what she knew her sister had.<br />
<br />
It was a piece of jewelry that their grandmother had given Darla...at least that was how Katie, Karen and Denise remembered it...and ever since then Katie had wanted to play with it but Darla kept telling her, &quot;No&quot;, and &quot;This is very old and is not to be played with&quot;.<br />
<br />
Knowing about the metal box under the bed, Katie reached down and pulling the box out, she opened it and saw the Amulet sitting amongst the various items Darla thought were important.<br />
<br />
Taking the amulet, Katie closed the lid and stuffed the box back under the bed. Turning off the lights that she had turned on, Katie left the room and dashed back down the stairs. At the bottom, she slipped on the linoleum and pitching forward, she felt the Amulet leave her grasp and clatter first against the wall and then onto the floor.<br />
<br />
Worried, Katie fumbled about in the darkness, not wanting to turn on anymore lights. After a bit she located the necklace and jumping up, she ran through the house and back to her friend's home.<br />
<br />
Inside, she tore up the stairs and into Maggie's room. Dustin, who was now wearing a pink and purple dog collar...one that belonged to one of Maggie's plush animals...was lying on the floor. Looking at Katie, he said, &quot;Maggie is downstairs talking to mom about something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Katie reached over and picked up a costume of an Amazonian princess. Looking at it, she decided that it would work with the Amulet and exiting the room, she went to Dustin's room. Inside, she searched about until she found the leopard print underwear she knew Dustin owned. Looking at them, she figured that it would work with the costume and exited the room.<br />
<br />
Back in Maggie's room, she began to strip. Pulling her hair back with a tie, she pulled on the underwear and then the Amulet. Looking at Dustin, she beat her chest and grinning, she said, &quot;I might Ama, Amazo, zo, zo, nian woman princess.<br />
<br />
Dustin grinned as she stuttered to say the longer word and then merely offered a bark as a way of replying.<br />
<br />
Grinning in return, Katie squatted down to pick up the costume. As she did this...failing to see the crack along the lower edge of the Amulet...the necklace briefly touched the underwear she was wearing.<br />
<br />
The effect was instantaneous. A bright green flash and suddenly a pain rocketed through Katie's abdomen and groin area. Sitting up, Dustin asked, &quot;What was that,&quot; but Katie found she was unable to answer as the pain grew.<br />
<br />
Walking over, on all fours, Dustin reached over and gently took the Amulet from Katie, and told her, &quot;Let me see that,&quot; and began to turn it about in his hand.<br />
<br />
Katie, meanwhile, had now curled up into the fetal position on the floor. The pain from her abdomen had lessened, but the pain in her groin kept growing and growing. A strange sensation could be felt from her crotch area, almost like something was pushing outward.<br />
<br />
Groaning, failing to see that Dustin had somehow attached the amulet to the dog collar he was wearing, Katie stood and stumbled toward the door and the hallway beyond. Outside the room, she nearly fell over, but managed to keep her balance as she walked on two shaky feet toward the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Inside, she flicked the light on, realising that pain in her groin was lessening. With hands that wouldn't stop shaking, she reached down and began to pull off the underwear. And what she saw nearly caused her to scream.<br />
<br />
Hands still shaking, she reached down to confirm what she saw. The area in front was still flat, but between her legs she saw what was clearly a penis with a set of testicles placed just behind it, located where her mom said her vagina was...an area she had learned about when she was about six.<br />
<br />
Touching it, she was amazed that it was even there and all she could think was, &quot;Great. Now I have boy parts between her legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hoisting herself up onto the sink, Katie breathed a sigh of relief when the face she saw was still hers. Sliding off the sink, she reached down and picked up the underwear. Not wanting to put them back on, fearing that she might change more, she held them before her and exited the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Back in Maggie's room, she dropped them on the floor and reached for her underwear. Before she could put them on, a timid, feminine voice called out, &quot;Katie. I think there is something wrong with that necklace.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then, out from under the bed, crawled something that clearly had Dustin's head, but the body was that of some type of dog with a soft, golden coat of short fur. Looking up at Katie, Dustin said, &quot;You've got to help me. I'm part dog and I have girl parts for some reason,&quot; and then sat down, waiting for Katie to say or do something...failing to realise what Katie now had between her legs.</p>
