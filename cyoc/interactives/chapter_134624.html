<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">New Years for Jennifer had been spent at parties getting plastered in her past but now that she was just six years old she didn’t have the energy to stay up past midnight nor the age to get plastered. Instead she passed out at around ten after eating dozens of slices of cheese and meats her parents had set out for a variety of friends that all knew Jennifer but to her were complete strangers. They sat around the apartment playing cards and laughing while glasses of liquor were emptied and songs were sung off key. It must have been a long night because the house was a mess when she awoke the next morning and rubbed her eyes while looking around the mess of an apartment.<br />
<br />
School resumed shortly after New Years and kids continued to scream their lungs off and throw tantrums while Jennifer ignored them. By this point she had a reputation as a polite and well behaved girl and her mother must have been told these facts by Jennifer’s teacher a dozen times. She didn’t really get along with the other children seeing as they were literally kids and she was an adult trapped in the body of a child. She tended to wander around by herself at recess, eat by herself at lunch period, and spend her weekends at home. Saturday morning was a time to get up early and watch cartoons on TV. If she was lucky she could just catch the tail end of an adult programming block. Episodes of Barbaria, a show about a village of ruthless barbarians and all their vulgar and violent adventures tended to play just before the worst block of programming imaginable.<br />
<br />
Sparkle the Unicorn was apparently what was in for girls right now and a two hour block of it aired right after the adult programming ended at six. Usually she ended up watching the entire thing in the same way she had done when she was a little boy watching lame shows she didn’t like just because something cool was on right after it. The girly unicorn show began at six and ended at eight on saturdays and if Tristin and Trevor didn’t get up she could watch boy shows about giant robot mechas that fought monsters of the week and had their own toylike. Unfortunately adult Trevor was lame and really liked the news, which was drab and boring. It wasn’t even like he watched the interesting stuff about cop chases, politics, and disasters. No he literally watched the stock market like it was a sports game and by the time he left with a kiss to Jennifer’s cheek Tristin was up and putting on those talk shows hosted by a larger than life personality talking about suicide and accidental pregnancies. Tristin had made fun of these types of programs before Jennifer had turned into her child but now she watched the celebrity host with intent eyes and commented on what went on in the show.<br />
<br />
Saturdays and sundays worked liked this. Tristin had Sunday’s off and Trevor had Saturday’s off so one of them was at home with Jennifer at all times and they usually left well enough alone, letting her do her own thing and enjoy whatever she wanted but every so often they’d decide to be lame parents and do something “cool”. This usually had a ulterior motive behind it. Trevor wanted to get his laptop repaired so they were going to the mall for a few hours, Tristin wanted to lose weight so they’d go for a walk, or they both wanted condoms so they’d go on a family shopping trip and buy a suspicious collection of items specifically for lovemaking and rightfully assuming Jennifer wouldn’t get it. She did however but couldn’t care less. Some of these trips led her to some of the most exciting moments of her life. Tristin was now her mom and trips to the local pool resulted in seeing her body nude. Something Jennifer had dreamed about as a guy but now could experience as a girl. Tristin didn’t even seem that bothered by her, it was completely understandable.<br />
<br />
Weeks passed like this, more holidays flew by and the seasons began to change, winter melted away, spring emerged, and eventually even school let out and the joy of summer vacation returned with one surprising announcement on a Friday they both had off.<br />
<br />
Tristin fed Jennifer a sandwich while Trevor packed things up, they hopped into the family vehicle and suddenly the lame family outing turned into the most exciting moment of Jennifer’s life. They were at the beach, the exact beach this had all started at. Excitement filled her as Tristin helped her into a bathing suit and put her own on. They found a spot on the sand and Tristin turned to Jennifer happily.<br />
<br />
“Ready to get lotioned up?” Tristin asked but Jennifer just shook her head no.<br />
<br />
“I’m going into the water!” Jennifer replied before turning heel and rushing towards the water with power behind her legs. Her feet pumped until she hit the surf and she immediately dove in until the cold water had soaked into her pores and dampened her hair. She sat up with a smile and waited for changes to begin. A buzz of adrenaline filling her body.</p>
