<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will walked over to his computer and picked up a pencil in his jaw. He used the pencil to carefully type out: nate, come over. i need your help.<br />
<br />
He waited a moment and Nate responded. &quot;Okay, I'll be right over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luckily, Nate lived a couple houses down, so it was only a couple minutes before he arrived.<br />
<br />
Nate walked in the front door without knocking, which had become customary around Will's house. Nate was a staple at their place since his home life was less than stellar, given that his parents fought a lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will? Where are you buddy?&quot; asked Nate as he looked around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Up here. In my room.&quot; answered an apprehensive Will.<br />
<br />
Nate bounded up the stairs and walked down the hall, turning a corner to Will's room. All he saw was a big Old English Sheepdog sitting in the middle of the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny. All that's in your room is a dog. Hey, when did you get a dog? I would've thought you'd have told me sooner...&quot; said Nate, looking around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, I am the dog,&quot; said Will. Nate stared right at the dog, dumbfounded. He had just seen that dog talk, sounding just like Will.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; said Will, walking slowly over to Nate. Nate ran his fingers through his friend's fur. He couldn't believe it. The only part that was recognizably Will was his distinctive green eyes, with remained largely unchanged. Everything else was 100% sheepdog.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand...&quot; said Nate. Will then proceeded to tell him about the closed room at the museum and the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is the ring now?&quot; asked Nate. Will looked down at his paws, the ring was not there anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;It must have slipped off. Check the bathroom. I'll look around here,&quot; replied Will. <br />
<br />
Nate walked into the bathroom across the hall. Sure enough, on the bathroom rug in the middle of the room was the ring. Nate bent over and picked it up, turning it over in his hands.<br />
<br />
So, this is the ring that turned Will into a dog, thought Nate. He could barely contain his excitement at the thought. Nate had always had a secret fantasy about shapeshifting, especially from human to animal, and now he held in his hands a genuine chance to try it out. He had never voiced this desire to anyone, for fear that they would think he was weird, or possibly insane. <br />
<br />
Nate noticed the inscription on the inside of the ring. He inspected it closely and then read it aloud, &quot;In canis corporea transmuto.&quot;<br />
<br />
He slipped the ring onto his ring finger and anxiously awaited to see what happened. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Will was in his room, looking for the ring when a familiar tingling sensation returned. He looked down and noticed the fur was receding, his paws stretching back out into human hands, his hind legs and the rest of his body returning to human proportions. Soon, he was his normal, fifteen year old human self. <br />
<br />
Nate walked back into the room, shocked to see a naked but human Will standing in the middle of it. Will quickly grabbed a blanket off the bed to cover himself with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you turned back. Cool,&quot; replied Nate. <br />
<br />
Will noticed the ring was on Nate's ring finger. &quot;What did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, don't get mad. I've always wanted to see what it was like to turn into an animal. I couldn't help myself,&quot; replied Nate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well you're about to find out now. Take a look at your self,&quot; replied Will.<br />
<br />
Nate looked down at his hands. The same changes were happening to him. His arms were covered in a white and gray fur, his fingernails reshaping into claws and turning black. Nate ran into the bathroom to watch his changes, excited by what was happening. <br />
<br />
He pulled off his shirt and pulled down his pants, noticing that his entire body was covered in a thick white and gray fur. He started to feel weird as his body went through the bulk of the changes. His legs reformed into hind legs. His arms changed to front legs and his torso reshaped itself to dog like porportions. He watched with fascination as his face pushed out into a snout and his ears reformed and flopped over, like a dogs. <br />
<br />
He looked himself over in the mirror. He looked just like Will did as a dog, except his dazzling blue eyes remained, the only part unchanged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; he muttered. &quot;Now how do I turn back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should have thought of that earlier, moron,&quot; replied Will, who was standing in the doorway.</p>
