<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P ...>Weeping over her sad and humiliating situation, Sally clomped to the phone, but like to the door security chain, her cloven hooves were too cumbersome to poke at the numbered buttons.<P ...>

<P ...>She became near to frantic thinking about having her udder, her huge breasts, and worse yet, those damned hooves to deal with for a couple of days. In a sudden thought, she tried punching the phone buttons with her tongue, and this seemed to work just fine. Scraping to her one of the sticker tags that came on the hoofs, she then read the phone number for the shop and tongued it on the phone.<P ...>

<P ...>"Ring, ring, ring, ring, ah yeas, ah Fancy Fun costumes and things, what can I do for, oh its Sally, how do you like your udder?" This the man answering the phone call said, he without her speaking a word, knew it was his afternoon customer calling, wanting an early, easy freedom from what she purchased.<P ...>

<P ...>"Hello, ah yes, I would like to know how to get these things off from me?"Sally asked, she knew the man was odd, especially then, as he knew it was she calling, and he remembered her purchase.<P ...>

<P ...>"Oh yes, you failed to fully read and contemplate what the sticker tags said, and you used the inflater gun..., nice sensation I am told, the having then of a full udder tucked between your legs! And, yet too now you call and wish for it to come off, off..., oh but your boyfriend inflated the udder, he did the same to your human breasts too..., oh and then he suckled on your teats, this is troublesome, bad for you both!" The man said, his words as a mental empathic realization of what all happened, but to him what was to come seemed worse.<P ...>

<P ...>"Why what is it, can I get this thing off from my belly, I want to be free of this, please, please, please!" Sally became infuriated, wanting in the worst way to be rid of, and to forget she ever did this to herself.<P ...>

<P ...>"Hmm, there was an easy fix, but with and after you let your boyfriend suck, he did suckle your udder teats, am I correct?" The man at the store asked Sally, her answer came in a whimpered moan. "Well then, to begin with you, your allowing him to suckle your udder teats has made them a permanent part of whatever you are or still could become; I mean to say, if you prefer to be a thing in some freak show, then nothing more need be said! However, if you would rather, I could send over a package, and once you donned on the full outfit and costume of a Holstein dairy cow, the obvious will become as your new reality. In less than one day, you shall become so accustomed to being like and seeing yourself as a dairy cow, come the second day morning time, I shall send to your address a truck and stock trailer to bring you to where you can live in some sort of parity and personal dignity." This the man at the store did offer to Sally, as she stood on all fours and her cloven hooves, she horrified at giving up everything she had and would have, or looked forward to getting from her life.<P ...> 

<P ...>A long pause happened, as Sally thought about her living as some freak in a sideshow, she the cow lady, and this failed to please her. She considered then the offer for her to accept a full change of embodiment, she becoming then as a dairy cow, and living then the lifestyle of such a animal, she continually pregnant so as to produce milk.<P ...>

<P ...>"I...," Sally began to decide her fate, as just then the man spoke up saying, "Colin, after all it was his insatiable desire for sensual fun that got you into this predicament. Well, let me assure you he will not get away "Scott free," oh no, he suckled your teats, drank your magical milk, and longed to want for more. He shall duly want for more, as for him he is at present beginning to find his passions turning from making love to young women, as he pangs mostly to want for mating now with cows, cows, and more cows!"<P ...>

<P ...>Hearing that Colin would not get away from what he doomed her into being, Sally said in reply, "OK, since I want not to be as a freak, the offer to become as a dairy cow seems the obvious and more agreeable decision to make, send your full costume!"<P ...>

<P ...>"Fine," the man said in reply to what Sally agreed to do. He paused then in speaking, and then struck up on a noted thought, his voice changed as if happily he might have something different to offer Sally. "Per-say, is a dairy cow what would interest you, or would you rather, I can send over the costume of a beef cow heifer; you could live a bit more calm a lifestyle, mating once a year, dropping your calf, and weaned, the calf walks away to let you relax for a while, is this anything you might prefer?"<P ...>

<P ...>This whole conversation was one bestial choice after another, as Sally failed to gain any thrill about her loss of humanity standings and the becoming of an animal, property, and needing to live as do cattle. She set there still listening, the phone line open, she breathing heavily as she thought to decide.<P ...>

<P ...>"In a note to help you decide, as for Colin, he having suckled and drank your milk, well he about now is feeling the needed urge to urinate, and when he enters the bathroom and tries to angle his maleness into the bowl, well it won't be so amiable as would expect. His swallowing of the milk in it's early on stage retains many of the magic properties. His body is now beginning to show signs of physical transition of species. Indeed, I assure you, that come next week on this same time a week after having sucked a teat, the thought of teats will turn to the lust for mating of cows. Colin will by then make a fine form of one yearling size of a Holstein bull." Sally hearing that, she laughed in a maniacal manner, and said send me a..."<P ...>

<P ...>"I think, if given the choice, I would prefer some time to being myself, even if being so I need be a heifer, a cow, but one of the beefy variety!" Sally said, she made up her mind, delighted that Colin would get some of the same sort of humiliation too!<P ...></p>
