<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice lay in the grass, breathing heavily. Though she was incredibly skinny, she wasn&#39;t a very fit person, and a massive orgasm followed by running wildly around the yard had winded her. As she slowly caught her breath she mentally kicked herself for not thinking to include some kind of strength or stamina enhancement in her new accessory. In fact, she could have included all kinds of fantastic things had she been able to think through the perpetual fog of horniness she&#39;d been stuck in from the moment Heather had told her about the shop and its possibilities. Well, she couldn&#39;t really complain about it now.<br />
<br />
She gazed up at the clouds, idly fingering herself and wondering what to do with her new freedom. Hanging out in the yard was fun and all, but what was the point of the collar if she just hid away here. She began considering the places she could go. At one point, Brittany opened the back door to tell her that she was going to the mall to hang with her friends and wanted to know if Alice would like to tag along. Alice just waved her away with her free hand. The mall sounded fun, but Britt&#39;s friends were annoying. Whenever she tagged along she could see just how much they resented her being there, holding back her much more popular younger sister.<br />
<br />
But the mall did sound nice. All those people.<br />
<br />
Alice made up her mind. The mall was out, since Britt&#39;s friends would be there, but there was another place with lots of people on a sunny Saturday like this. The park.<br />
<br />
Alice jumped to her feet and took off through the gate and down the sidewalk. It really was a nice day and the neighbors were all out in their yards gardening, trimming the grass, washing their cars, or just enjoying the sun. She felt a perverse thrill as she ran past them, her bare feet slapping against the concrete and leaving damp foot prints.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t believe how wet this was making her. The thick coating of juices on her inner thighs allowed her legs to slide silkily past one another with each stride. She giggled drunkenly as she rounded the corner into the park.<br />
<br />
As she had suspected, it was packed. She was forced to slow her pace so she could dodge all the mothers pushing prams along the path. Every person she passed stared appreciatively at her as she went. Their eyes going up and down her naked form. A few of them even greeted her by name, but she was far too horny to try and figure out who they were. Eventually, she found a miraculously vacant bench somewhere near the center of the park and threw herself onto it. She took a few gulps of air, and spread her legs as far as she possibly could.<br />
<br />
Alice lost all track of time as she sat and masturbated on that bench. For all she knew she could have been there for days, cumming repeatedly for the small crowds that would gather to watch. When she needed to pee, she didn&#39;t even begin try to hold it in and would just let it wash over her hands and spray across the pavement in front of her. She blacked out at least twice. The first time she was shaken awake by a pretty young policewoman who gave her a bottle of water and fingered her for a bit before moving on. The second time she came round to a dog licking her crotch while the owner, a handsome young man in a polo shirt and slacks, just watched it happen and laughed when she came.<br />
<br />
Eventually the shadows began to grow longer and the crowds began to thin out. A policewoman, probably the same one from earlier, Alice was too exhausted to tell, came by and told her that the park was closing and she needed to head home. The naked teen just nodded and tried to stand up, but her legs were too weak to hold her weight and she collapsed into the puddle of mixed urine and sexual fluids that she had left in front of her seat. She rolled over in it a few times, trying to figure out which way was up, before finally managing to get to her hands and knees and begin crawling home.<br />
<br />
It was a long journey back to her house. Even on all fours she was still shaky and fell over many times on the way. The magic of her collar protected her, keeping her palms and knees safe from the rough concrete as she dragged them along. Several people stopped to ask if she was okay or if she needed a lift, but Alice waved them away and kept up her crawl. Finally, she made it back to her own yard and, after a brief rest in the cool grass, the back door. She managed to pull herself shakily to her feet, where she swayed for a few moments until her head stopped spinning, then carefully slid the door open and stumbled through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice! Where have you been?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of her mother&#39;s voice almost knocked the poor girl over, but her mother was quick and grabbed her by the arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just look at you! Have you been rolling around in the mud? And you stink! You&#39;re going straight in the bath young lady!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice let herself be marched through the kitchen and into the mud room. The previous owners of the house had kept several large dogs and had installed an extra tub there for bathing them. Alice&#39;s parents had kept it and it had seen quite a bit of use when Alice and Britt were young and prone to getting absolutely filthy while playing outside. While her mother prepped the tub, Alice caught sight of herself in the full-length mirror her image-obsessed mother had hung on the wall.<br />
<br />
She was a sight. Her already unruly mass of red hair was a tangled mane with leaves, twigs, and other detritus caught in it. Her sweaty skin was covered in patches of mud and filth and flecked with so many speckles of dirt that you couldn&#39;t tell them apart from her freckles. Her eyes lingered for a moment on her small breasts. They were covered with a thick coating of dust that had clung to the drying fluids she had smeared there during her masturbation marathon in the park. Her nipples stuck out prominently through the filth. Her gaze traveled further down until it reached her pubes. They were worse than her hair. Completely matted and caked with who knows what. Surprisingly, she could see her clit sticking out through the mass. She&#39;d always had an oversized clit, but now it seemed massive, and below it her tangled pubes were parted and she could see her labia puffing out. They were red and swollen and a large drop of her juice stretched down towards the floor on a thin filament as she watched.<br />
<br />
In the enclosed space the smell of her filth was becoming quite thick. It was a combination of sex, sweat, and piss, with hints of cut grass and wet dirt. She breathed deep and became even more turned on by the thought that the smell was from her. Her hand began drifting towards her drooling cunt, but was grabbed halfway by her mother, who pulled her forwards and helped her awkwardly into the tub.<br />
<br />
Alice expected her mother wanted her to clean herself off, but was surprised when the older woman snatched up the sprayer and began hosing her down like she was a small child again. No, not like she was a child. Her movements were rougher and she pushed Alice around and gave short sharp commands. Almost as if Alice were a dog.<br />
<br />
This just turned her on even more. She dropped to all fours again as her mother grabbed the old bath sponge and the bottle of body wash they kept in here for emergencies. Alice was in heaven as her mother roughly scrubbed her down, muttering threats of various punishments under her breath while she did so. When it came time to scrub the filth out of her pubes, Alice rolled onto her back and spread her legs wide, moaning and massaging her aching nipples while her mother scrubbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you like that, do you?&quot; her mother said as Alice pushed her hips up to grind against the sponge. &quot;Did you deliberately get yourself this filthy so that I would have to clean you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice, truthfully, shook her head no.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I find out you&#39;re lying to me there will be hell to pay. Honestly, I&#39;ve never seen you so dirty before in my life. You better not make a habit of this, or I&#39;ll have to send you off to obedience school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice just moaned as the sponge caught her clit and pushed her over the edge. Her mother tutted and continued to scrub her clean. When all that was left to wash was her hair, her mother shut the water off and stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay!&quot; she said imperiously. &quot;I need to go get a comb and some shampoo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice watched her mother leave the room, then looked down at herself. She was squeaky clean. Her nipples were still stiffly erect and had taken on a darker color. Further down, her pubes, now clean, lay flat and wet. This made her clit seem positively massive as it stuck out, throbbing slightly. Still aroused, she reached down and gripped it gently with her finger tips and began stroking it like it was a tiny cock. Despite how worn out she was from the countless orgasms she had had that day, she managed to squeeze one last one out before collapsing to the bottom of the tub and dozing lightly.</p>
