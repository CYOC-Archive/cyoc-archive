<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I, uh...&quot; Tyler swallowed. He wanted... he wasn&#39;t sure what he wanted. He was turned on, for sure; his penis was starting to strain against his pants. But... it wouldn&#39;t be right to just stick it into a stranger, would it? Well, it didn&#39;t <i>feel</i> right to him, even though it was her job -- or rather her whole purpose as a sexbot. But he couldn&#39;t see her as just an object; she seemed so... real.<br />
<br />
But never mind the awkwardness of sex with a stranger, he wanted so much <i>more</i> than just to pound into her. He wanted to feel her, to bury himself in her softness. It was so over-whelming -- he just didn&#39;t know where to start!<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; He blushed. He didn&#39;t want to admit to her that he&#39;d never been with a girl before, and had no clue what he was doing. &quot;Maybe... could you... suggest something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, sugar. Don&#39;t tell me... this your first time?&quot; His jaw dropped a little, and she giggled. &quot;Don&#39;t take a psychic to pick up the signs. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve helped guys like you before. Well, how about I start with a pole dance? Get your blood flowing. And we go from there?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded, tongue-tied, and followed her swaying hips over the pole. She mounted the little stage, and he took his seat on an adjacent leather couch.<br />
<br />
<i>God, her body...</i> He was not sure if he was more impressed by the realism -- if it weren&#39;t for a few design features deliberately showing it off, he would not have guessed she were a robot -- or by her sexiness.<br />
<br />
And once she laid her hand on the pole -- it was like a new reality had opened for him. Her confidence and poise, the way the light played over her fur, highlighting her curves as she moved; her strength as she hoisted herself up and twirled around. It was also so... <i>desirable.</i><br />
<br />
She paused, hanging by a hand and a crooked knee, smiling down at him. With a wink, she undid her bra with her free hand. He watched, riveted on her chest as her boobs jiggled, compressed, and bounced free. He stared at the large mounds, soft but with a springy firmness -- until his world turned blue. He gasped and pulled the bra from his face; he&#39;d been so enchanted that he hadn&#39;t even noticed her toss it. Her giggle was lost in the rushing of his blood in shame.<br />
<br />
She resumed her captivating motion. Tyler leaned forward, following every grip, every bend, every turn around the pole. <i>I wish I could move like that.</i> She looked so beautiful, so confident, so... free. And so damn <i>sexy.</i> It was... confusing. He wanted to... well, to fuck her. But he also kind of wanted to be her?<br />
<br />
This time he paid more attention as she slid her bottom over her rounded, juicy ass; shimmied it down her long pink-furred legs. With a kick she sent it flying up, caught it in her hand, kissed it and tossed it to him with a spin.<br />
<br />
Before he had been too embarrassed to pick up the fragrance clinging to the top. This time, however... well, maybe it was the kiss that encouraged him to bring the bikini bottom to his own lips, and inhale the heady scent in the process. Faint odour of flowery perfume, faint odour of rubber and metal; very strong odour of synthetic sexual fluid. They had indeed gone all out on the realism. Tyler clenched the bottom in a suddenly tight fist, aware that he had reached full mast -- or close as he could within the confines of his clothing.<br />
<br />
On cue the sexbot spun herself off the pole and hopped off the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy the show, hun?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded dumbly, his eyes travelling over her body, now towering over him in sensual glory, the unobstructed pink fur seeming to glow in the low light of the private room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got an idea what you wanna do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I uh...&quot; He tugged at his collar. <i>I look so stupid.</i> She laughed warmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how about we give your poor little boy some attention?&quot; She guided his legs apart, and knelt between them. Undoing his fly, he caught his breath as the pressure on his dick was released. She slipped his boxers down, and he felt a warm exhalation on his sensitive flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;You -- you breathe?&quot; He winced as soon as he said it, but she merely laughed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;When it makes our clients happy, sure. But don&#39;t worry, we don&#39;t <i>need</i> air... so we can give blowjobs like no human woman ever could...&quot;<br />
<br />
Technical details were driven from his head with a groan as she nuzzled into his groin, rubbing his stiff length through her cheek fluff. She kissed his balls, then up the bottom of his shaft; finishing with the head before taking it into her mouth and giving it a cute little suck. &quot;Mm, tasting good, sugar.&quot;<br />
<br />
He leaned back on the couch, hands sinking into the plush leather behind him, watching her across the expanse of his chest, which was beginning to heave and sweat as she worked him over with loving expertise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God... feel so good...&quot; Imitation saliva, hot and wet, dribbled down his shaft and onto his balls. Her throat squeezing around him as she took him deeper, and deeper... he couldn&#39;t believe this was a machine! And her eyes... they were glowing, but they looked... <i>alive</i> as they stared up at him through her lashes. It might have been unnerving, if it weren&#39;t so <i>sexy</i> the way she looked, all her focus on pleasing <i>him.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna -- I can&#39;t --&quot;<br />
<br />
And then she pulled off, wrapping her fingers firmly around his shaft as it bucked and jerked in pre-orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm, I&#39;d love to taste your cum, sugar,&quot; she declared. &quot;But seeing as this is your first time, maybe you&#39;d like to take my pussy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I -- ah -- if you think...&quot; He drew a breath. That <i>was</i> what he initially had in mind. &quot;Y-yes. If you... if it&#39;s... please?&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed. &quot;I swear I ain&#39;t never had someone <i>quite</i> this nervous before. But it&#39;s okay, hun. It&#39;s really nice that you&#39;re so sweet and considerate.&quot; As she spoke, she stood up and released his cock to throb in disappointment, slowly slipping back from the edde.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, bottom or top, honey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want me to lay under you, or ride you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! U-under...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it. Here we go.&quot; She helped him up, then took his place on the couch, laying down and spreading her legs. &quot;Now just crawl on top of me. Mm, yeah, like that. Get yourself lined up, and... <i>there</i> we go!&quot;<br />
<br />
She continued to guide him, encouraging him through his initial reluctance. This was... so weird. To actually be <i>inside</i> someone else! But it felt good. And as he relaxed, and followed the gentle rhythm she set, it began to feel <i>great</i>. Especially with her generous breasts right in his face, so he could let himself down to press into them or, at her suggestion, pull a nipple into his mouth.<br />
<br />
Hearing her moan sent a thrill through him. <i>She likes it? She likes me?</i> He&#39;d totally forgotten that this was supposedly just a machine, and one done up as an anthropomorphic animal. He felt a connection with her. In that moment, she was his lover, and he wanted to pleasure her as much as she did him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brittney! I feel -- I feel --&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let it go, sugar! Give it to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her legs wrapped around his, her velvet hands pressing his butt to her as he thrust into her silky folds; his cock swelling in ttheir embrace, and erupting into her depths. He cried out over her moans, and felt her shuddering, her tunnel going crazy around him.<br />
<br />
Spent, he collapsed onto her, panting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh... huh... h-how did I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did good, sugar.&quot; She ran a hand down his back as he snuggled into her. She was so good, so soft and warm... like a big loving pillow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks... Brittney.&quot;<br />
<br />
He half-dozed, head cradled on -- or in -- her bosom as she petted him. He&#39;d never felt this good. It wasn&#39;t just the afterglow. It was the... intimacy. Yeah. He just wanted to lay here and... be with her. Forget the outside world. Forget... everything. Forget...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sugar. Fifteen minutes left. You wanna do something else before our time is up?&quot;<br />
<br />
...That this was just a paid-for fantasy with a sexbot. He sighed into her cleavage, aching for something... more.</p>
