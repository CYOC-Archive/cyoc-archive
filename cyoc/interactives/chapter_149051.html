<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And you&#39;re <i>sure</i> they broke up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely, it&#39;s been making the rounds at school, but I&#39;ve also overheard Brad talking about it after school. He seems pretty bitter about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect. Because it isn&#39;t much of a revenge if she ends up getting her goods returned as a making-up present.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, Brad is convinced he&#39;s blown his shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he has, though not as much as who I gave her pussy to. Actually, I&#39;ve wondered about that. Why didn&#39;t <i>you</i> want it when I offered it to you first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While the thought certainly crossed my mind, I hate Jen. Savoring the thought of who has it now gives me more pleasure than that loose cunt ever could. Besides, I&#39;ve already got a toy from my first go-around with the curse. If you look under here, say hello to my bully from middle school. She changed schools afterwards, but unfortunately for her not phone numbers. She&#39;s a year older, got her at the end of July right as she was heading off to college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my, that&#39;s quite creative, I assume that&#39;s all that&#39;s left?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, there are three. The vagina one has the nipples underneath, and the mouth one has the rest of her face on the outside. The size also magically adjusts. You know, since I&#39;m still a growing young man! And because someone scrawny like me might need to present a gift to get into a frat eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but you don&#39;t seem the type to enjoy fraternity life. Regardless, you&#39;ve got a talent for this sort of thing. But how&#39;d you get the curse back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s easy. She got both so I dared her to be super horny for the first day, then reminded her of the curse when she came to. Her mind was so altered by the transformation at the time that the only dare she could think of was for my cock to grow to it&#39;s current size. Have to admit I was sweating bullets at the time though. I didn&#39;t bother doing that with Jen, because she was the last name on the list. I only added in that she&#39;d forget her turn with the curse. I can&#39;t prevent her from cursing, but I can prevent her from knowing she can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s her name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it matter? Nobody has any recollection of her existing, also part of how I worded the curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Genius. But getting back on topic, can you help me with getting the thing into his locker after it&#39;s ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, he tends to forget the combination so his friends always have to remind him what it is. I could recall it in my sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I&#39;m counting on you. And here we are, right on time too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the ride, let me know when you&#39;ve got all the parts in place.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Wrapped in a towel, Kyle stepped into his room after taking a shower. Looking at his drawer for a moment, he took out a very special pair of tighty-whities (though he could change them to any form of underwear), slipped them almost all the way up, and looked in the mirror. The briefs looked as new as the day he got them, despite him having had them for almost half a year along with the other two he received that day, and they&#39;d remain eternally-clean and un-stretched as long as the curse existed regardless of how many times he wore them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I&#39;ve only used your asshole this week, but I wanted to talk to you so you&#39;re going to be sucking me off tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Susan Zhou&#39;s anguished face, looking like a living drawing, blinked & stared back at him from above where his pubic bone was. Her petite Chinese features were framed by the seams of the briefs&#39; crotch pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember your friend Jen? The one you watched me curse the other day while I was plowing your ass? A friend and I have something very special planned for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan&#39;s sunken cheekbones usually looked as if she were continuously wailing, or calling for help, or sucking a dick, underneath her blank lower face when she was in the drawer. But when Kyle pulled her all the way up until she tightly wrapped around his torso, the real reason for this became apparent as her cheeks suddenly bulged out and Kyle felt the delicious sensation of her relocated oral cavity (sans teeth) wrapped around his now 12-inch cock, and her tongue caressing his balls as they sat in her mouth. It was lucky for Kyle that the curse had kept Susan&#39;s holes leading to their proper places wherever her body was in stasis now, otherwise he wouldn&#39;t have a clean pair of pants left.<br />
<br />
Kyle felt Susan&#39;s lips rub up & down mildly against his pubs and upper ballsack, like she was trying to mouth something. &quot;I know you&#39;re curious Susan, so let me tell you exactly what Martha and I brainstormed...&quot; He pinched the blank spot where Susan&#39;s mouth would be and began to pull & push at it. This had the effect of Susan giving him head as he outlined his plans. <br />
<br />
As their owner got horny, the three pairs continued to automatically suck, squeeze, or contract, two of them rather unsuccessfully while sitting in Kyle&#39;s drawer.  Above her chipmunk cheeks and the animated tears that still flowed from her eyes, Susan listened to Kyle & Martha&#39;s scheme while she continued to suck his dick with Kyle watching her.<br />
<br />
After he finished explaining a few minutes later, Kyle pushed his balls back in her mouth with a pat on her face, and went to his computer. Susan felt pity for her former friend. She hoped that the despicable plot Kyle and that bitch had hatched would backfire on them. If Jen can just remember that she has the curse...and use it more intelligently than I had been tricked to...she can turn the tables on these two fuckers, Susan thought. For the first time in what seemed like months, Susan regained her sense of self and anger from her treatment flowed anew. She looked up at Kyle resentfully as he sat in his chair playing a game, having already went back to ignoring Susan besides enjoying the feeling of her diminutive throat wrapped around him. Feeling Kyle&#39;s balls twitch in her cheeks, she fervently hoped that her friend would prevail as she licked every crevice of his sack. She even allowed herself to have a little hope that in doing so, Jen might inadvertently free Susan from her long confinement on Kyle&#39;s magically-enlarged meat rod. From the stories, Transform or Dare tended to have unexpected outcomes, and turnabout was a common one Susan told herself. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kyle began to climax as he felt Susan gargle his balls. <i>I didn&#39;t even tell Martha the mental change I made,</i> he thought as he began to jizz down her pint-sized trachea. <i>It&#39;s no fun if they break for good.</i> He glanced between his legs at Susan&#39;s defiant expression as his spunk shot into her stomach for the thousandth time, before resuming his match.</p>
