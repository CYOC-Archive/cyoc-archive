<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It&#39;s been a wild night, and as much as you&#39;d love to vent or explore, the fatigue from it all is crashing down on you.  You and the other woman exchange surface level pleasantries and “good nights” before retiring to your separate rooms.<br />
<br />
You slide off your shoes and collapse on the bed, still in your clothes.  Whether it&#39;s actually that comfortable or you&#39;re just that tired, you can&#39;t say, but either way it feels great.  You don&#39;t even have a chance to consider preparing for bed properly before you&#39;ve passed out.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
You awake the next morning to faint morning sunlight on your face from a window.  You&#39;re at first confused waking up in a strange place, but as the morning grogginess fades, the events of last night return to you.  You gaze down at a rubbery hand and move it up to your head to feel the blank spots where your nose and ears should be to confirm that you didn&#39;t dream it all.<br />
<br />
Still in your clothes from the previous day, you search for your shoes, but can&#39;t seem to find them.  You look in the empty closet and all on the floor, but whether through your own misplacement or the magic of the house, you can&#39;t seem to find them anywhere.  You brush your teeth at the sink, and with nothing else to do, you cautiously open the door to your room and step out into the hall.<br />
<br />
Just as you get outside, a door opens behind you, and you turn to find the other servant leaving her room as well.  She holds the doorknob with both of the feet that extend from her wrists to awkwardly get a grasp on it and shuts it behind her with a hip.  The two of you make eye contact, and she gives you a half smile with a low “Hey,” which you return in kind.<br />
<br />
“So, uh, what now?”  You ask.  As if on queue, you hear footsteps approaching and look to find Agatha approaching down the hall.<br />
<br />
“I see you&#39;re both awake,” Agatha begins.  “It&#39;s no coincidence that we all convened again at the same time.  You&#39;ll be awoken according to my needs each day.  As time progresses, you&#39;ll find yourself needing less sleep, but that will come as the vow settles in.  In your non-human states, you&#39;ll also find yourself not needing to eat, but you still can on your own time if you wish.  Though, for now, follow me up to my study.”<br />
<br />
You both fall into step behind her as she leads you back to the main foyer and up an elegant, balustrade staircase.  She explains a bit about what she did last night – Something about binding spells to objects and locating an item of importance to her, but it&#39;s hard to follow some of the jargon.  Eventually you arrive at a room that you&#39;ve not yet been to.<br />
<br />
Inside are a couple shelves filled with old books.  Papers and writing utensils are scattered about the floor and various tables and desks.  In the corner, a couple of large comfy-looking chairs border a small table with a lamp on top.  Agatha walks over and sits in one, while the pair of you stand before her in wait.  She considers her words for a moment before speaking with a touch of hesitation.<br />
<br />
“I have not yet gone into detail about what all you&#39;ll be doing for me.  Soon, I will have an errand for you to retrieve something very useful to me, but I will need to prepare you first.  I thought this would be a good opportunity to cover some... other matters as well.”  She pauses again, as if the next words are difficult to find.<br />
<br />
“I have spent many years here alone.  I&#39;ve never been especially socially involved, and I was banished here during my time in the academy, so I&#39;m somewhat inexperienced in, um, certain endeavors.  Ah, you see, it is not unusual for thralls to also serve their masters in... corporeal capacities.”  She blushes and smooths her dress.<br />
<br />
“In any matter, both of you will have to be working closely together in several of your duties here, including the one I have for you today, so I thought this might be a decent time for us to break the ice in a few ways.  Do you understand?”<br />
<br />
“Um, I&#39;m not sure I follow.”  You say.  Your co-servant shakes her head in agreement.<br />
<br />
“Well, then let me be a bit more direct.”  Agatha lifts her hands in a manner that you now recognize as in magical preparation.  With a flick, you suddenly feel cool air against your skin.  You look down to realize that you&#39;re stark naked.  You move to cover yourself with your hands.<br />
<br />
“Ah, maybe it will be simpler to ease into this if I take those for now.  They will probably be too much of a distraction anyway.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll take care of them.” <br />
<br />
With another motion, you feel an odd jerk on your genitals.  The hands that were covering them now cup empty air.  You look down to see smooth latex skin where your cock and balls should be.  You touch it in confusion to find it feel no different to the skin on your stomach above.  You look up in shock at Agatha, who&#39;s watching the two of you intently.  She gives a smile at your reaction.<br />
<br />
“Now, let&#39;s start slow.  Just look at each other.  <i>Look</i>.”<br />
<br />
The last word has a strange clarity to it as it reaches you.  It feels different from the command words she&#39;s used, but you can tell there&#39;s probably some magic going on.  You turn to the other woman, who now faces you.<br />
<br />
You found her attractive before, but that&#39;s nothing compared to affect she has on you now.  You find yourself pouring over every inch of her, finding each bit utterly enticing.  Wherever your gaze lands, you fixate and drink in every detail.  You especially focus on individual parts, her face, her chest, the blank patch of rubbery flesh between her legs, her neck, her elbows, her knees, her feet, everything.  She seems to be experiencing something similar as her wide eyes dart up and down you wildly.  You find yourselves moving closer.<br />
<br />
She extends an arm hesitantly towards your chest.  She stops halfway and looks up into your eyes.  <br />
<br />
“Can I... can I touch you?” she asks in a breathy whisper.  You nod vigorously, and you both fall into each other.<br />
<br />
Your hands trace over each contour of her body.  You caress her stomach, her breasts. You run a hand up the curve of her shoulder before tracing fingertips along her collarbone.  You feel a pair of feet moving all over you in similar fashion, inspecting every detail with what dexterity they can achieve.  She nuzzles into your chest as you trace her spine.  Your latex skin produces the occasional rubbery stretch or squeak as you rub against each other.   <br />
<br />
To your side, Agatha leans forwards in her chair, watching hungrily.  A hand creeps down to lift and sneak under her dress as she looks on.  Her lips move silently, and you feel the desire continue to build.<br />
<br />
Your focus on specific parts of the woman is intensified.  You move a hand up to the side of her head to caress an elongated ear between your thumb and forefinger.  You have a sudden and strange urge to have more, and you give the ear a slight tug without thinking.  To both of your surprise, it comes off in your hand.  She gasps and lifts a foot up to feel the blank spot where the ear was.  The moment in which you were both lost is gone instantly.<br />
<br />
In alarm, you try to put it back, not knowing what else to do.  To your relief, it stays.  She touches the ear in puzzlement and then looks at you with consideration.  Suddenly, her feet reach to hold your right hand between them and give it a tug.  It comes off,  leaving a rubbery-flesh-covered stump at the end of your wrist.  You still can feel hand where she holds it, though you can&#39;t move it more than a twitch.  She then offers her right arm back to you.<br />
<br />
Thinking you understand where she&#39;s going, you give the foot a tug, making it come off in turn.  She juggles the hand to the empty wrist and wrestles it on, where it holds fast.  It quickly begins to numb as she flexes it experimentally.  You follow suit and press the foot into your wrist.  Immediately you&#39;re greeted with a burst of sensation as your body incorporates the new appendage.  You move it around and wiggle the toes in curiosity.<br />
<br />
The two of you look back up at each other, and the hunger returns with even more intensity.  With her new hand, the woman returns to her pursuit in earnest as she strokes it all over your body.  She grabs your lips, plucking them off of your face like a sticker and bringing them into a deep kiss.  As you focus on different parts, you intermittently pop them off and give them a squeeze, or swap them entirely, as she does likewise with you.  <br />
<br />
You fill empty spots, taking an ear or her nose, or replacing the mouth that she stole from you with hers.  At one point, she has both of your hands, quickly taking a few pieces for herself without replacing them immediately.  With each swap, the numbness in the exchanged parts takes longer and longer to kick in, as well as to fade.  Eventually, you never seem to lose the sensation of any part as they&#39;re passed back and forth.  A cloud begins to settle over your thoughts and you completely lose yourselves in the overwhelming rush of urges and sensations.  <br />
<br />
You begin to lose track of where your body stops and hers begins, or who is doing what.  At one point, you&#39;re fairly sure that your heads are exchanged, but with how mixed up you&#39;re becoming it&#39;s hard to even tell.  As your thoughts continue to fog, you feel a warmth replacing the dull numbness that covers your bodies from all of the trading.  You sink into each other, pressing more and more together as you&#39;re caught up in your reverie.<br />
<br />
As you do, the features that you each eagerly stroke and explore slowly begin to lose definition.  Your sense of self gets dimmer and dimmer as you drift into each other, slowly melting and deforming.  At this point, you&#39;re unable to process what&#39;s happening to you.  Your mind is awash in the pleasant glow that consumes you as you melt together into in indistinguishable pool of liquid latex, not that dissimilar to what you first ran into the night before.  You aren&#39;t sure how long you drift in this state, blissfully empty.<br />
<br />
When your senses eventually return, you find...</p>
