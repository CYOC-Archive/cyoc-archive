<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cindy pulled her brother down the hallway and toward the kitchen.  Sam was surprised at how strong she was -his shoulder was even getting sore- and chalked it up to increased strength coming from her bearish changes.  &quot;I&#39;ve got him guys.  Here he is!&quot; Cindy announced as the siblings entered the kitchen, their toeclaws clicking on the tile floor.<br />
<br />
Sam entered and for the second time that morning he was totally speechless.  Smack dab in the middle of the kitchen was what looked like a nearly eight foot tall bear!  It was so tall that its head was practically brushing the ceiling.  The creature was covered in long shaggy brown fur and it was standing on two enormous paws that put Sam&#39;s own partially transformed pawfeet to shame.  It was leaning against the kitchen island and when it noticed Sam&#39;s entrance the beast gave a toothy smile and waved a big paw-like hand.  &quot;Hi Sam!  Me Bajoo!&quot; the bear said, greeting the stunned teenager.  Sam was so surprised that it took him a moment to notice that &quot;Bajoo&quot; wasn&#39;t wearing a stitch of clothing and, by the look of its pendulous fur-covered balls and the thick musky sheath that was attached to the beast&#39;s belly, Bajoo was definitely a male.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What the HELL, Cindy?  There&#39;s a freakin&#39; grizzly bear in our kitchen and you weren&#39;t going to tell me?&quot; Sam asked, glaring back at his smug sister.  &quot;Where the heck is Mom?  Does she know about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well honey.  Technically, we&#39;re all grizzly bears.  At least, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been told we&#39;re all turning into,&quot; replied Sam&#39;s mother Sheila, emerging from behind the kitchen island on all fours.  Sam looked down stifled a surprised roar.  It was his mother all right, but not as he&#39;d seen her just yesterday.  She had transformed far more than he or Cindy thanks to Bajoo&#39;s relentless rutting throughout the course of the evening, the grizzly bear&#39;s infectious cum giving the woman dose after dose of the transformative virus.  Her once dainty hands were big and broad and covered in light brown -almost yellow- fur, her fingernails now the long claws of a bear much like Bajoo&#39;s.   Her mouth and cheeks had pushed forward into a furless muzzle and her nose was broad and black, just like that of a natural bear.  She still had her shoulder-length blonde human hair and sported the typical &#39;mom cut&#39; with bangs but sticking through it were two furry half-moon ears that were every bit as bearish as Sam&#39;s.  &quot;What&#39;s the matter, honey?&quot; Sheila asked, cocking her head in concern.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-y-y-you changed,&quot; Sam managed to spit out, the teen&#39;s eyes practically popping out of his head.  &quot;Yes honey, I&#39;m different now and I&#39;m still changing.  So are you and Cindy,&quot; Sheila explained from the floor.  &quot;Here, let me get up for a moment.  Bajoo was teaching me how to walk on all fours.  It&#39;s really quite enjoyable,&quot; Sheila continued.  Sam gawked as his mother stood up from her quadrupedal stance and assumed a more human-like posture.  She was barefoot (or rather, &quot;bearfoot&quot;), her footpaws smaller than Bajoo&#39;s but much more animal than Sam&#39;s.  It was obvious with her two-inch long toeclaws and leathery black pawpads that wearing her favorite slippers was out of the question.  She had dressed herself in her comfy yoga pants but by the look of the fur tufts poking out of the numerous slashes in the material, it was clear Sheila had experienced the same problem as her son in trying to get her paw-like feet through the pant legs without damaging them with her new toeclaws.  <br />
<br />
Now that she was standing, Sam could also see that his mother had put on the bright pink workout top that she usually wore with her yoga pants.  The lycra top was held up by thin straps that left her neck, shoulders, and arms exposed.  It allowed Sam to see that his mom&#39;s light golden pelt, which started at her handpaws, ran up her arms and thinned out until it just became just wisps of fur at the tips of her elbows.  Besides that she&#39;d sprouted patches of thick fur across the top of each of her shoulders making it seem as if she was wearing furry shoulder pads.<br />
<br />
But it wasn&#39;t his mother&#39;s burgeoning pelt that bothered Sam so much as what else he could now see.  Although it had fit her well in past, Sam could tell that the pink top was hugging her especially tightly today.  There were four sizeable lumps that were pressing through the lycra fabric covering her lower chest and Sam gulped as he realized that these were in fact new breasts.  He could even see the smaller penny-size nubs crowning each bigger lump that he instantly knew were her nipples.  Sheila&#39;s four lower breasts were in addition to the noticeably larger mammaries that were straining the the upper part of her workout top, and which were human (more-or-less) if he could somehow ignore the thick patch of blonde fur that had sprouted in the valley between them.  The overall effect was somehow indecent, his mom&#39;s attempt to keep things normal by wearing her ill-fitting top only exaggerating the bestial transformation to her body.  Sam could not ignore the fact that mother now had six breasts like some kind of... animal freak!  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, we need to get help.  Maybe there&#39;s some way to undo all this,&quot; Sam pleaded gesturing at her mutated body.  &quot;Sam, you don&#39;t understand.  I LIKE what I&#39;m becoming.  I haven&#39;t felt this good in years.  I feel ALIVE.  I feel WANTED,&quot; she emphasized as she looked up into the eyes of the big grizzly manbear who&#39;d transformed her.  &quot;The virus can help you too if you let it,&quot; the bearwoman explained as she placed a paw-like hand on her son&#39;s shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s some other things that are going to change around here too and I want you to hear it from me...&quot; his mother continued.</p>
