<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some thinking, I set my age to 8 years in body and to the world, except to Rachel and my parents, and clicked save. I then walked over to the mirror to watch the changes. Once in front of the mirror the changes began. I saw in fascination as my body slowly deflated like a balloon as I get younger. I notice the changes as my body shrinks in height and loses muscle definition.  My body hair also recedes and my face rounds out. Once at 13 I then hit a massive &quot;shrink spurt&quot; has I now shrinks to just around 5 ft.  My body became completely hairless besides the top of my head, and my Adam&#39;s apple disappears. After another minute the shrinking stopped and I was now 8 years old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, wait, is that my voice!?&quot; I said, surprised at how childish I sounded. I then checked his profile.<br />
<br />
SCAN RESULTS:<br />
Name: Michael Drake<br />
DOB: March 25, 2008<br />
Age: 8<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 4’ 3”<br />
Weight: 58 lbs<br />
Sexual Preference: N/A<br />
Hair color: black<br />
Eye color: blue<br />
Occupation: Student; 3rd grade<br />
<br />
“This feels so weird,” I said. I then took the time to examine myself in the mirror again. I now had no defined muscle, rounded face, no body hair, and my clothes were fitted to my now childish frame. I then took a look around at my room, everything looked so big now and it now looked more appropriate for a child of my current age though not too childish it seems. Maybe it reflects that my parents still know that I am not really 8. The only thing that remained the same was my computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; I said, enjoying the sound of my now younger voice. I then left my room to go show everyone downstairs.<br />
<br />
When I came downstairs, the reactions from his family varied. Mom and Dad already knew I was going to be younger so they looked only slightly surprised. Rachel on the other hand looked like she was in a state of shock with her jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
“So how young are you right now?” My mom asked. “8, I did not want to get too young.” I replied, which caused Rachel to get out of her shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, so this is what you meant when Michael would be different when he came down.&quot; Rachel said. Seeing Mom and Dad looking younger was weird enough for her but to see her older brother now younger than her was something else.<br />
<br />
“So how is it like to be younger?” Dad asked. “A little weird, everyone and everything seem so big now.&quot; I replied while looking around. I almost could not remember having to look up so much at my parents again; on top of that my younger now temporarily older sister now stood a full head taller than my current height.<br />
<br />
“So, I’m the big sister now? Rachel asked excitedly. “Only for a week,” I replied. I hoped my sister would not do anything bad to me now that she is bigger than me, which made me wish that I locked my Chronivac before going downstairs.<br />
<br />
“Rachel, you be nice to your brother.” Mom lightly chided my sister. “What, I am a big sister now to a cute little brother; I have no reason to be mean to him.” My sister said. That made me feel a little better, though being called cute was somewhat embarrassing.<br />
<br />
“Huh, it is almost lunch time.” My dad interrupted. “Honey, why don’t we and the kids all go out for lunch?” Rachel and I perked up at that, I did wonder what it would be like to go out when I am like this.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Mom began. “We do need to go grocery shopping anyway so why not. Michael, Rachel, do you two want to go out for lunch?” “Sure/Why not?” Rachel and I both answered. We both went to our rooms to get our shoes on then we went to the front door where Mom and Dad were waiting. We all went out to the car to go out.<br />
<br />
We then went to McDonald’s, one with a playscape. We went in and we made our way to the front counter to order. Due to my now smaller size I settled with a junior cheeseburger with small fries and drink, I didn’t need the kid’s meal. After we ordered our food, I looked at the playscape. It has been years since I have been on one of those, how nostalgic. There were already some other kids playing on the playscape, some my current age, some younger, some a bit older. I had to admit, I was tempted to get on again; I am the right size now, and at my now current age I would easily fit in with the other kids there without it looking weird. I turned to look at my parents and they both gave me a look of amusement and understanding, it seemed they already noticed where I was looking. My mom gave a sigh.<br />
<br />
“Go on ahead; we will call you when the food is ready.” She said, and I gave in to the temptation. I then made my way over to the playscape. “Be safe though.” She called out. “I will Mom.” I replied.<br />
<br />
When I went into the playscape room, I noticed Rachel followed me in. “I’m here to watch you.” She said. I just shrugged and started to take off my shoes. After doing so, I started to climb. I had to admit, climbing and sliding down the playscape was rather fun. None of the other kids on the playscape really gave a second glance so I knew I was fitting in without suspicion. After several minutes, Mom called us for the food and we went to our parents to eat. The cheeseburger and fries tasted different, richer in flavor. It seems my sense of taste is enhanced when I was younger. After finishing the burger and fries, I played on the playscape for about ten more minutes before we left to the grocery store.<br />
<br />
At the store, once again everyone and everything seemed so much bigger now. Adults all towered over me again; even middle school kids were bigger than me now. Also all the higher shelves in the aisles were out of reach. While we were walking, I had to fight to keep up now with my shorter legs.<br />
<br />
“Can you all slow down a bit?” I asked. “Oh, sorry Michael, I guess we forgot that you were smaller.” Mom said apologetically. Rachel and my parents thankfully now walked at a pace I could do fine. After getting groceries, we ran into one of Mom’s friends and her kids that we all knew at the checkout line. Mom then had a conversation with her and just like the Chronivac said, she and her kids did not notice than Mom and Dad were 25 in body nor did she notice I was currently only half my normal age. While they conversed, my Mom’s friend made a comment on how quiet and well behaved I was in the store.<br />
<br />
“I know, Michael is only 8 years old and yet he already has the maturity of a boy twice his age.” Mom replied, which had Rachel and I giggling at the irony. The conversation ended soon after that as we checked out our groceries. We then went home. After the groceries were put up, I went to the upstairs TV to see what was on. I decided to see if there were cartoons on, I was now a young kid after all so why not indulge a bit. After seeing what was on, I found that in my opinion cartoons today are not exactly what they used to be. So I decided to find stuff to watch on my computer, which luckily was unchanged in my room and did not have parental controls. After probably a couple of hours, I heard a knock door.<br />
<br />
“Michael,” my Mom said, “Time for dinner.” “Coming Mom,” I replied. I then left my room for dinner downstairs. I came to the table and sat down. “Oh and Michael,” Mom began. “Make sure you eat your vegetables.” She said playfully. <br />
<br />
“Mom,” I began dryly just because I look like a kid, does not mean I have to act like one.” He finished. “Besides, I don’t think you had that many problems with me there.” I added. “Well you do have a point there.” My Mom said and we started to eat.<br />
<br />
Dinner was more or less the same as before; though because I was smaller my portions had to be smaller as well. Also after tasting the vegetables, I learned why many young kids tended to avoid vegetables. While still palatable, they tasted differently now with my enhanced sense of taste. I for one soldiered on through them anyway. After dinner I was going to go upstairs but Rachel caught up to me first.<br />
<br />
“Hey Michael, do you want to play Mario Kart with me on the Wii U?” “Why not,” I replied with a shrug. We then both ran upstairs to the TV, Rachel beat me there thanks to my now shorter legs. It took a little bit for me to get used to the controller now that it was bigger to me. After I got used to it we had fun on Mario Kart, I won some, Rachel won some others, I did not care much we were just having fun. After a couple of hours, Mom came up to us.<br />
<br />
“Kids,” she began, “It is now close to 8:30pm, and it is about time for you both to get ready for bed.” She finished.  “Mom,” I began, but I am not tired yet.” I said with a yawn at the end. “That yawn says otherwise young man.” She said. “Boys at your age have a lot of energy, but they get burned out at the end of the day. You will need more sleep then you did at 16 to stay healthy.” She finished. I could not exactly argue with that. Besides, I made myself like this so I have to live with it. <br />
<br />
“Fine,” I said. “I expect you both to be in bed by 9pm.” Mom said. I then went to my room to get my pajamas and I went to the bathroom. I could not reach the shower easily so I decided to take a bath. I was smaller now so I could sit down without trouble. After enjoying the bath for around 20 minutes, I dried myself off and put on my pajamas. I then noticed my smaller size meant that I had to use a stool to brush my teeth. After brushing, I went to his room, but before I entered, Mom was waiting for me near the door.<br />
<br />
“Mom?” I asked. “You’re about to go to bed?” She asked. “Yeah,” I began with a yawn, “I should probably start tucking in.” We both walked into my room as I was getting to bed. When I got into my bed, mom gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek.  “Mom?” I asked, slightly embarrassed. “Sorry Michael, you being this young, I couldn’t resist.” She said. “Goodnight,” She said. “Goodnight Mom,” I replied, still embarrassed. Mom then turned off the light and closed the door.<br />
<br />
I had an interesting day when I was younger; I then wondered what tomorrow would be like. I fell asleep after several minutes of pondering.</p>
