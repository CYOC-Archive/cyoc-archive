<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy was used to curling up with his tail – it was almost instinctual for him to tuck it up against his stomach when he went to sleep at night.  It was for that reason that her new situation was all the more obvious.  Where his tail should have met the slight obstruction of his two furry balls, it now pressed slightly in against her new, tight slit.<br />
<br />
Just as her finger slipping in had dispelled any notion that Troy was still a man, the strange new feelings associated with her tail pressing up into herself prevented her mind from slipping into a sense of normalcy.<br />
<br />
The rest of her tail was running along her stomach underneath her new dress, with the tip just brushing up against the bottom of her new breasts.  With a scared flick, Troy realized that her dress felt too loose, too… airy.  While it tightly fit her form around the chest and back, it felt like there was a lot of extra room right at the stomach.<br />
<br />
The milk filled breasts and loose dress… <br />
<br />
“Oh no!” Troy thought.  She wasn’t done changing yet.  <br />
<br />
Having already pivoted towards the front door, Troy heard a voice screaming in her head to run.  That if she could just get back to the front door she wouldn’t change anymore.  But she barely managed to lift her foot before she felt something pressing up against unfamiliar muscles in her abdomen.<br />
<br />
The pressure increased dramatically and the thing inside her rapidly grew.  She looked down at her belly just in time to see it begin to inflate outwards, pressing her tail away while it rapidly filled the dress.  With a strange popping sensation, she felt the thing inside of her pressing onto her belly button so hard that it inverted from an innie to an outie and it wasn’t long before her swollen belly was stretching the previously loose fabric that now clung to her stomach.<br />
<br />
As the thing inside of her grew, it put more and more pressure on new muscles, tendons, and other tissue that hadn’t existed until a few seconds ago.  That feeling of pressure caused Troy to instinctively clench down, discovering that she had some control over these new muscles as they felt over the new thing inside of her.<br />
<br />
The first thing she could tell was that there was a lot of fluid – it was almost like having a giant water balloon stuck inside of her and her exploratory clenches elicited a slight jiggling sensation.  While the center of the thing’s body was suspended inside of her – preventing her from squeezing down on it, she could feel the “edges” of the thing as they pushed out into her uterus.  Pressing down at the bottom was a round, hard object that felt like a head, midway up were two small hands that were trying to pinch the fibrous flesh that surrounded them, further than that were two hard lumpy objects that must be feet and, whipping around against the top of her abdomen was a thin, snake like object that must be the tail.<br />
<br />
What Troy was feeling, she realized, was a baby.  Her baby.  <br />
<br />
Before she had any time to ponder the ramifications of that, it felt like the baby came loose and “fell” inside of her, with its head slipping down and very uncomfortably squishing the tissue down there against her hip bones.  She half expected it to just keep falling until it came out her, but it pressed into a hard wall of flesh.  That flesh pulled on tendons.  Those tendons pulled on her back.  And her back held, stopping the baby from descending any further.<br />
<br />
Troy let out a feminine gasp.  <br />
<br />
Every nerve in her body was crying out in pure discomfort.  Everything was under pressure – her stomach, her pelvis, her bladder, her breasts.  She had to go pee so bad and her nipples ached for release.  The muscles in her stomach strained to carry the new weight.  Her skin and ligaments were stretched as tight as they could go.  It wasn’t necessarily painful, but everything just felt wrong, it felt like it was being asked to do something that it was never designed to do.  But there was nothing Troy could do to relieve any of it.  Troy was stuck with the pressure, stuck with the… baby now occupying the majority of his belly.<br />
<br />
Troy didn’t have time to try to look around and locate her attacker.  She had to get out of here, now.  In a sense, Troy was fortunate that she had only been transformed into a pregnant woman – if she was dealing with the Book of Body then, who knows, the next thing that her attacker took from her might be her limbs.<br />
<br />
She tried to take off running towards the front door.  But while she was still part tiger, all of her former feline speed and grace had been soaked up by her new child, leaving her to make a quick waddle instead.  Each time she moved a leg, bones rubbed unpleasantly against the baby’s head.  Each time her foot contacted the ground, it sent a shock wave through her body that caused her breasts to jiggle – despite the heavy duty bra – and the baby to bounce against her cervix.  Again, it wasn’t painful.  It was just unpleasant.<br />
<br />
As she neared the corner to her garage, she heard a voice call out from the front door, “Hey hun, what are you doing out there when you’re so close to….”<br />
<br />
“Rusty get inside!”  Troy screamed as she rounded the corner.  Rusty was standing in the front doorway, a confused expression on his face.<br />
<br />
“What…”<br />
<br />
“We’re under attack Rusty, get inside!” Troy pleaded.  <br />
<br />
Troy remembered who she had been before but Rusty didn’t, which meant that the mere sight of a gravid anthropomorphic tiger running towards him didn&#39;t do anything to alert him of the danger he was now in.</p>
