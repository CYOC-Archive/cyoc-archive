<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cal and Katy return after quite a while. By now the rest of them had returned back to the living room. Mark, who was sitting down in the same chair as before, was slightly surprised to see Cal wearing a flat bra, tight bike shorts, and a bit of light makeup, however he wasn&#39;t complaining, especially when Cal walked over and took a seat upon his lap again. There was a nice smelling fragrance surrounding Cal too. &quot;Did Katy put perfume on you too?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;J-just a small amount. Why, do you not like it?&quot; Asked Cal nervously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding me? I love your scent. And your makeup isn&#39;t half bad either. Though I am not sure how practical its going to be for you. And what is with the bra? Its doing nothing for your non-existent tits.&quot; Asked Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katy insisted that I start wearing one for a while every day, as well as whenever we go out, so that I can get into the habit of wearing them. Same with the makeup, and well, some other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Such as?&quot; pressed Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, well. One of them is changing my name to &#39;Cali&#39;, so it is more feminine sounding. Also that until she leaves, I have to wear a lot of different kinds of female clothing. And that I should start considering myself to be a woman, and ummm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on, I want to hear it all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She said that we should have sex very often, and the kind where only I am the one getting fucked. Especially at night, where we will be more or less sleeping while knotted together from now on, and that you should focus on stimulating my... breasts.&quot; Cali explained how that since she would be Mark&#39;s bitch for the rest of her life, that developing her more feminine areas was the priority task at hand. Just not wearing clothing was no longer an option at the moment anymore. <br />
<br />
Cali would need to learn how to properly walk in heels, do her own makeup, clean herself, put on various clothing and most importantly, how to entice Mark to fuck her, which luckily wouldn&#39;t be hard as even now he was subtly snaking his cock through the pant leg of her shorts. Cali stopped his attempt and gave him a certain look, which Mark understood to mean &quot;not now&quot;. However, that look changed into a sly grin as Cali quietly &quot;adjusted&quot; herself on his lap. <br />
<br />
To his delight, Mark felt her grab his cock and pull it through a hidden pocket opening on the underside of the shorts. Normally, these shorts were a custom design meant for a catheter tube to be able to fit through the hidden opening, but Katy had widen the hole significantly for her. Now Cali was sitting facing forward, eith Mark wrapping his arms around her in order to hide the fact that she was currently getting fucked by him. While they didn&#39;t really care who knew or watched them, they wanted to try and sneak it in this time just for the fun of it. Of course Katy knew exactly what they were doing, but the rest were ignorant of the fact that the 2 of them were fucking right in front of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, going forward...&quot; began Mark, drawing attention to himself as he stopped thrusing his cock into his bitch. &quot;I plan on making Cali here my wife, as she is my Bitch for life. This means that if any of you join my pack, she is the alpha Bitch, and I am our Alpha Male. Does anyone here have an issue with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
No one initially said a word, simply shaking their heads in acceptance, that is until Cali began to speak. &quot;Actually I have a request. I want to be the only dog pussy you fuck. I dont care if you fuck Katy in her human pussy, but I want to be the only one who gets pregnant with your children. I want that exclusive role. I don&#39;t care how the rest if you go about fucking, but I want my pussy to be your exclusive cock hole. In return, you will have unrestricted access to me. You will never need to ask for permission either, just stick it in me whenever you feel like it. In other words, you can fuck me whenever you feel like it and it will always be considered consentual, even if I am asleep or drunk.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was Katy who was the first to answer her request. &quot;Aren&#39;t you his bitch though? I thought unrestricted access to your pussy came with that title?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She is right you know&quot; agreed Mark &quot;However I will still accept your request to be the only dog pussy I fuck, but only until you deliver me your first litter. After that, we will see how we feel about this topic again, ok?&quot; Cali nodded, happily accepting his offer.<br />
<br />
Mark then did the unexpected, which shocked the others, but at the same time, made his wife cum instantly. He stood up. Cali&#39;s feet couldn&#39;t reach the ground putting her entire weight onto Mark&#39;s cock. As he help hold her up with his arms. However the moment he began to walk out of the room, was when she no longer could control herself and began moaning and panting like the bitch in heat she was as her legs hung loosly beneath her, occasionally twitching from the incredible amounts of pleasure she currently was experiencing. The rest just watched what had happened in disbelief. For the first time, they finally understood just how strong Mark really had become.</p>
