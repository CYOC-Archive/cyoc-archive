<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they carded their hands through the vials, it became clear that there was no obvious way to get rid of the excess fat. Greg sat down on his haunches, very aware of the extra padding they had, and sighed as Mark continued to look through the vials. &quot;Look, man,&quot; he said. &quot;They don&#39;t even have labels, just pictures. How the hell are you going to find anything to help me?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s <em>something</em> in here that will do it. I just can&#39;t find it yet...&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well, you said that this thing would counteract the change if I drank enough of it,&quot; Greg said, holding up the blue Male vial. &quot;Let&#39;s keep trying that, shall we?&quot;<br />
 <br />
Before Mark could protest, Greg had raised the vial to his lips and swallowed the viscous blue liquid. His hands clenched the vial as the transformation set in. His hands began to swell, enveloping the vial as they grew in size and strength. And it was not just his hands that grew, his entire body began to stretch, the fat being redistributed over the larger surface area of his now 6&#39;9 body. And beneath that fat, now only lending his figure a bit of plumpness, Mark could see the striated muscle that hid beneath, veins pulsing with each beat of his large, strong heart.<br />
 <br />
Mark stared at the man before him, now standing inches taller than his own impressive frame. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder how much &#39;man&#39; Greg had become; was he now twice the man Mark was, or three times? His eyes trailed down Greg&#39;s barrel chest, following the trail of quickly spreading fur down to his Adonis belt, and then below. Greg&#39;s shaft was truly a beast of its own, the thick shaft hanging low over his heavy, pendulous balls, at least a foot of flaccid flesh. And his balls were just as impressive - two softball-sized testicles that hung halfway to his knees. And as the massive man groaned, the last vestiges of the transformation leaving him, the cock began to extend, to full mast, a whopping two feet of pure manhood. <br />
<br />
Greg groaned and looked down at himself, one hand on his massive dick, the other clutching his gut. He wrinkled his nose in disgust. &quot;Still fat,&quot; he boomed. He grabbed the vial again. &quot;Can&#39;t this thing work any faster?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, well, you can combine the doses to increase the strength of the transformation…&quot; Mark said, before trailing off. Greg had already grabbed a cup and was mixing several doses together, at least four, by his count. Before he could warn him not to do it, Greg had downed the concoction in a single gulp.<br />
<br />
His stomach rumbled. Suddenly, he began to shoot up in height, half a foot at a time. His body climbed larger and larger, pressing against the ceiling in no time. The mammoth man fell to his hands and knees, gripping the floor tightly as his body convulsed with growth. The 12-foot man gritted his teeth as his height finished increasing, only to be substituted by extreme muscle growth. His body pulsed larger with every heartbeat, packing on ton after ton of muscle. Greg let out a roar of pain as his body quadrupled in weight quicker than he could blink. His voice had begun to deepen to a dangerous, bestial sound - primal and predatory. Mark shivered. Something in that voice just screamed at him to obey and submit to his alpha.<br />
<br />
Hair grew out across Greg&#39;s ridiculously muscular body, giving him a look akin to a bear. Only, his new body was far larger, stronger and more dangerous than a bear. He felt power flow with each passing second, as his muscles grew denser than lead and stronger than steel. Glands began to form in his hair follicles, excreting powerful pheromones, able to make even the most stubborn man or woman submit to his might. He took a deep sniff of his manly scent, before willing himself to excrete even more, moulding Mark&#39;s mind completely to his will.<br />
<br />
Greg straightened up, even his kneeling form towering over Mark. Huge mountains rippled across his massive frame with each tiny movement, and he bared his slightly sharpened teeth at the smaller man. His two arms, thick as oil tankers yet able to move just as freely as they had before, came up to his crotch. Wrapping a hand around the now diminutive tool, he began to stroke, watching it grow longer and longer out from his crotch like a telescope unfolding. Two feet, then three, the thick cock extended. It pushed itself into Mark&#39;s chest, the head as wide as his torso. Mark gulped.<br />
<br />
A growl tore itself from Greg&#39;s lips as he gripped his dick in his meaty, clawed hands. &quot;Now this is the stuff!&quot; he thundered. &quot;Not so fat am I now, little man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;re not,&quot; Mark stammered. The 12-foot monster caught his eye. Mark suddenly felt lost in the predator&#39;s gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, what would you think if I drank a little more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No!&quot; Mark shrieked. Not that he could do anything - Greg had become a beast no one could ever dream of besting. And the beast did not like his dissent, his mouth forming a ferocious snarl as he bent down to better intimidate the smaller man. Mark scrambled for something. &quot;What I mean is, why do something you already know the effects of? Why not try something different?&quot; He gave a nervous chuckle.<br />
<br />
Greg straightened thoughtfully. &quot;Perhaps you&#39;re right, weakling. What do you think I should take?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark gulped again. &quot;Uhh, why don&#39;t you try…&quot;</p>
