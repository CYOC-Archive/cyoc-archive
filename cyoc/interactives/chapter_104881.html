<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll help you then,&quot; said Cameron fearfully. <br />
	&quot;I knew you would help us, bro! But remember, if you try to resist, then you must be ready to face the consequences,&quot; Simon warned. &quot;Now, you should take a nap, dude. You look exhausted from all that cock sucking! You can crash in the guest bedroom, Cam and tomorrow, I&#39;ll tell you my plan to turn your good friend, Alex, into one of us.&quot;<br />
	Cameron was in shock as he lumbered after Simon to the guest bedroom. He couldn&#39;t let his friend get turned into a jock too! But, at the same time, he was scared of the consequences of resisting Simon. Cameron wanted to stay awake and try to make a plan to warn Alex of the impending danger without Simon or the other jocks finding out. However, he was out like a light as son as his head touched the pillow even though it was still rather early in the afternoon.<br />
	Cameron woke up with a deep, manly groan. He glanced at the clock sitting on the bedside table and much to his surprise, found out that it was eight o&#39;clock in the morning! He had slept from the previous afternoon till now without realising. Cameron looked down at his blanket-covered body and saw that he had a raging hard-on. He experimentally gripped his cock at the base and let out a moan at the mind blowing sensation. <br />
	Cameron knew that he wouldn&#39;t be able to walk around with an erection, so he decided rub one out. God, he was so horny! He formed a tunnel with his right hand and proceeded to jerk off. Cameron was jerking himself off with such passion that his hairy belly and manly breasts jiggled too.<br />
	After a few minutes, he came with a shout. Cum covered his hairy, smelly body. As Cameron laid there in his hairy, sweaty and cum covers body with a stupid grin on his face, Simon suddenly burst into the room holding a jockstrap. He was wearing his usual outfit, a smelly jockstrap that was too small for his manhood and nothing else.<br />
	&quot;Rise and shine, bro! We have a lot to do today,&quot; grinned Simon. Simon also had an equally stupid grin on his face that told Cameron that Simon had been jerking off. <br />
	&quot;This jockstrap is for you, dude. It should absorb all that musky precum that your meaty cock is producing nonstop! It&#39;s also large enough to fit your formidable waistline. Come on now, try it on,&quot; urged Simon.<br />
	Cameron got out of bed and put it on. While it was big enough to fit his waistline, it was still too small for his dick and he could see his cock and some pubic hair sticking out from the jockstrap.<br />
	Then, Simon explained to Cameron that reality had been altered. No one would remember Cameron as a geek anymore. Everyone would now remember Cameron as a fat ex jock who used to be able to run a mile. Cameron&#39;s parents would no longer recognise their son and Cameron now lived alone in his old house. <br />
        &quot;Cam, when you get to school, everyone will recognise you as the coach of the football team. So I want you to find Alex and bring him to the locker room. A few jocks and I will be waiting for you guys there.&quot;<br />
        Simon then left the bedroom to get ready for school. He had also left some clothes for Cameron to wear. They were the same things that Cameron had worn the Simon&#39;s house but somehow they had expanded to fit a person of generous proportions. Cameron proceeded to put on the clothes and looked in the mirror. Although the singlet had expanded to fit Cameron, it was still a bit too small and exposed a bit of Cameron&#39;s belly. He could also see his pit and chest hair sticking out of his tank top. Cameron sighed, knowing that there was nothing he could do to reverse the changes. He would be a fat, hairy and balding man for the rest of his life. <br />
        Cameron met Simon at the front door to walk to school together. Simon was also wearing a tank top and short shorts. Simon had to slow down to accommodate Cameron&#39;s slow, ponderous footsteps. By the time the two of them arrived at school, they were both emitting some pretty strong BO and Cameron especially was sweating profusely. <br />
        &quot;Remember the plan,&quot; Simon said in a low voice and walked off, probably to meet the other jocks. <br />
        Cameron then nervously waddled through the corridors of the school in search of Alex. Along the way, some students greeted him, obviously recognising him as the football coach. He nodded back. <br />
        Eventually, he found Alex. Alex looked the same but Cameron noticed that he was sporting an impressive thatch of blonde hair in each of his pits. Tufts of sweaty blonde hair stuck out even though Alex&#39;s arms were by his side. He was talking to some other geek called Jack. <br />
        Cameron called out to Alex and beckoned him over. He then ordered Alex to follow him to the locker room immediately. <br />
        Alex was puzzled. What did Coach Cameron want with him? He had never spoken to the coach before this. As he made his way over, he looked up and down at the coach. He saw that Coach Cameron was pretty hairy, with a thatch of hair sticking out of his singlet. He could also see some tufts of the coach&#39;s pit  hair. It reminded him of his own rather impressive thatch of  pit hair and made him feel a bit self conscious. He also noticed that Coach Cameron had a bald spot and a big hairy belly. The coach&#39;s singlet also emphasised his big manly breasts. <br />
        Alex had no choice but to obey Coach Cameron and so he followed the waddling man to the locker room.</p>
