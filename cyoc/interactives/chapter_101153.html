<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BACKTRACKING...<br />
In her human form, the werepanthress awoke to an unusual sight. She was alone in her bed. This was rare, since she knew there was a man next to her when she fell asleep.<br />
Despite the sensual feeling of the satin sheets against her bare skin, she forced herself to get up, answer nature&#39;s calling, and take her werepanthress birth control pill for today. A quick glance at the small clock sitting on the basin counter confirmed that she was cutting it <i>very</i> close, but she was confident that it had been a few hours since her last glorious round of sex with her paramour du jour, so she should be safe and not giving birth to an unwanted kitten within the next 10 months.<br />
As she started wondering where her werewolf was, there was a strange smell tantalizing her senses as she came out of the bathroom.<br />
She followed it to the kitchen and discovered her wolf in his human form, cooking!<br />
Not caring that she was totally nude and that he was only wearing the apron she usually kept crumbled up in the back corner of the counter next to the fridge, she watched with great interest as he fried bacon and collected toast as it popped from the toaster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! You&#39;re awake! How do you like your eggs?&quot; asked Nate Anderson, eyeing the beauty standing in the open doorway of the kitchen. Her long black hair cascaded over her shoulders as her creamy mocha skin was a stunning contrast against the white of the kitchen walls. Yet what really attracted Nate&#39;s werewolf senses, along with his stares, was the fact that not only were her dark nipples getting harder again, but there was a heady new scent of arousal coming from her vagina, along with a twinkle in her eyes and a widening smile on her face.<br />
&quot;You continue to amaze me, my werewolf,&quot; she said, coming closer to him. &quot;You are not only the first man I have found able to keep up with my sexual appetite, but now you tend to my more normal hunger as well,&quot; she added, before wrapping her arms around him and giving Nate a <i>very</i> passionate kiss.<br />
Nate gave in to the moment. The tips of her nipples pressing against his hairy chest as he felt his rising penis brush against her leg.<br />
As he felt her hand drift down to caress his hard cock, Nate reluctantly broke the kiss and said, &quot;As much as I want you, how do you like your eggs?&quot;<br />
She raised her hands back up and draped her arms over his shoulders, smiling as she said, &quot;Scrambled,&quot; before kissing him again.<br />
<br />
She set the table as he finished cooking. Nate couldn&#39;t help noticing that she was using fine china as if it were everyday stuff. Then again, when he searched the cabinets to get his bearings in the kitchen, Nate could never find anything... &quot;ordinary&quot; to use.<br />
He held out her chair before they sat down, sharing a <b>very</b> late breakfast together. If it was accurate, the clock on the microwave said it was after four, so she wouldn&#39;t be part of whatever <i>a duet with multiple encores</i> was for some VIP tonight. The fact they were both still totally nude wasn&#39;t lost on him, nor the fact that she walked around her own house that way like it was a natural state of dress.<br />
&quot;You are a man of many talents my werewolf,&quot; she said, before kissing Nate on the cheek. &quot;The food is delicious. Most men in your position would have just offered to buy me breakfast the next morning, provided they stayed that long anyway.&quot;<br />
Uncertain how to respond to that, Nate simply said, &quot;My parents taught me how to cook. They think it&#39;s important for anyone to be able to find their way around a kitchen. I may never be able to prepare anything truly extravagant or become a master chef, but at least I won&#39;t starve.&quot;<br />
&quot;Commendable,&quot; replied the werepanthress, as she continued to eat.<br />
Then, thinking there wouldn&#39;t be a better opportunity, Nate took a chance and said, &quot;They want to meet you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;My parents.&quot;<br />
&quot;They do? Why?&quot; she asked, sitting her utensils down and staring at him with a very confused look on her face.<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t break any of your rules. All they&#39;ve been able to figure out on their own is that I&#39;m seeing someone, and they smelled that we&#39;re sexually active together. But I agreed to ask you if you&#39;d like to meet them in exchange for getting their permission to spend this weekend with you,&quot; explained Nate.<br />
&quot;Permission? How old are you?&quot; she asked, staring at him more closely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I answer that, I did look up the law on the Moon Lake town website. Since I&#39;m a were past my first transformation, I&#39;m legal locally, although we&#39;d might have trouble anywhere else. My name is Nathaniel Anderson. I&#39;m 16 and a Junior at Moon Lake High School.&quot;<br />
&quot;Six...teen...&quot; she repeated slowly, truly flabbergasted at hearing this. &quot;I thought you were in college...&quot;<br />
Nate was starting to get worried as she continued to just stare at him. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; he finally asked.<br />
&quot;Dear sweet goddess...&quot; was her only response.<br />
Afraid that she was about to ask him to leave, or worse, Nate started to rise from the table. He figured she owed him at least long enough to grab his travel bag, if not a chance to get somewhat dressed as well, before she kicked him out the door.<br />
Instead, she grabbed both of his hands in hers, pulled them up to her chin, and said, &quot;My wonderful werewolf. My dearest Nathaniel. Will you marry me?&quot;</p>
