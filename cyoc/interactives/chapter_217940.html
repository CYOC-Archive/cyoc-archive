<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill squeezed the gemstone tighter in his hand, feeling the sharp edge of it&#39;s point cut into his skin, but the geeky eighteen year old was too annoyed, too frustrated, too enraged to truly care about the pain. He shoved Gloria against the wall of the upper hallway and ignored the shocked gasp of Tammy from a few feet away and pointed a finger, glowing from the sickly, off-color light emanating from within his otherwise closed fist, into Gloria&#39;s shocked, scared face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you&#39;re so pretty that you can just get away with anything you want, Gloria! And then you just hide behind the &#39;sweet girl&#39; routine whenever anyone actually tries calling you on your bullshit and then you make someone&#39;s life hell in revenge! I wish everyone could see what&#39;s really behind that pretty face of yours!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WAIT NO-&quot; Tammy cried out, but it was too late. The world between Bill and Gloria exploded in a sick, diseased looking green light and a wave of nausea swept over Bill as the hallway around him vanished into a dim darkness. He was falling, getting ...smaller? And his body wasn&#39;t responding to the mentally shouted commands to move, to do SOMETHING, but nothing happened as he simply felt himself being further compressed.<br />
<br />
And what worse is that Bill didn&#39;t feel the Stone poking into his skin anymore. Had he dropped it? Had the wish ...had the wish done something to it? The light hadn&#39;t looked exactly like it had before...<br />
<br />
But then before he could ponder anything further, the wave of nausea ended and the feeling of being compressed stopped, although Bill still couldn&#39;t move a single part of his body. And the air around him was no longer the comfortably cool ambient temperature of the Strasserman household, but was not extremely hot and humid, and something large and wet was pressing up against his front and back, while two impossibly hard...things pressed against him for either side.<br />
<br />
&#39;Where the fuck am I!?&#39; Bill tried to say, but there was only silence save for the wet sounds as the things in front and behind him flexed, and the heavy, rhythmic thumping of something that felt like it was...beneath him? And the then there was a terrifying vibration, and light and wind flooded the chamber, revealing to Bill just what and where he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;LIKE CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT THAT CHANDLER BITCH SAID TO ME!? JUST BECAUSE HER DAD&#39;S THE SUPERINTENDENT DOES NOT GIVE HER THE RIGHT TO WALK AROUND THINKING SHE CAN GIVE ME ORDERS! SHE&#39;S SUCH A BITCH, JONNY!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria&#39;s voice was all around him, moving him, moving through him, it was so loud that it blocked out every other thought Bill could have besides flailing his limited line of sight around in a blind panic, which only became worse once he realized where, and what, he was.<br />
<br />
He was a tooth! And the big fleshy thing was a tongue! HE WAS IN GLORIA&#39;S MOUTH OH FUCK<br />
<br />
But then came something worse. A dark shadow passed in front of Gloria&#39;s mouth, and something, Bill couldn&#39;t tell what, slipped past the fleshy gates that were Gloria&#39;s lips and into the mouth that currently house him. Bill didn&#39;t have a chance to figure out what it was before he was moving once more against his will as he slammed upwards into the object and began mashing it into smaller chunks and pieces. The process was surprisingly not painful, but not exactly pleasant as the pressure pushed down against Bill as his counterpart on Gloria&#39;s upper jaw assisted in the mastication of...whatever it was she was eating. And then other muscles in the cheerleader&#39;s mouth flexed and the pieces disappeared down the dark chute just a short distance away, and Gloria opened her mouth once more as something cold, dark and wet rushed in, filled the enamel-lined cavern, and then it too was flushed downwards into Gloria&#39;s esophagus.<br />
<br />
&quot;LIKE, I THINK ADMIN&#39;S LITTLE PRINCESS NEEDS SOMEONE TO SHOW HER WHO IS REALLY IN CHARGE HERE&quot; Gloria&#39;s voice rumbled once more before a piece of whatever she was eating slid into her mouth, and Bill screamed in silence as he helped the girl he hated chew her food.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh god oh fuck, what do I do!?&#39; Bill tried to think of a plan, but the CONSTANT motion, the pressure, the wetness and the thundering overwhelming force that was Gloria&#39;s voice made it too hard to focus on trying to come up with a plan to get out of there. If he even could. But finally the constant noise and motion ended as the distant ring of bell penetrated through the layers of flesh on Gloria&#39;s face. There was sickening kissing sound and a second large, fleshy thing slid in and around Gloria&#39;s tongue (and Bill), and then it was gone, silence (save for the normal wet sounds found in a mouth) taking over. The movement remained as Gloria flexed and moved her jaw, and her own heavy, wet tongue sliding back and forth across Bill and the other teeth, but he could finally just...think.<br />
<br />
But that was when he heard it. A faint, feminine whimper of someone crying. It sounded like...<br />
<br />
&#39;Tammy? TAMMY OH GOD ARE YOU IN HERE!?&#39; Bill cried out mentally as hard and as loudly as he could, and there was a surprised sniffle as the sobbing stopped.<br />
<br />
&#39;Billy? BILLY WHERE ARE YOU!?&#39; Tammy&#39;s voice called back. It was distant and echoing, like calling across a wide chasm in a underground cave.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m somewhere near the front! I think...I think I&#39;m a bicuspid!&#39; Bill called back, but suddenly unsure of just exactly how or why he had a sudden wealth of dental knowledge.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;M HER TONGUE! BILL, WHAT DID YOU DO!? WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO!?&#39; Tammy screamed back, and in the dim light that was provided by the narrow gap between Gloria&#39;s lips, Bill simply stared as the fleshy mass in front of him. His best friend, his wife and mother to his daughter, his girlfriend, was now nothing more than a wet, floppy muscle pressed up against him. And he was nothing more than a shell of enamel embedded in a gumline, wrapped around a nerve ending.<br />
<br />
&#39;I...I don&#39;t know!&#39; Bill said as his mental voice wavered. Just being parts of Gloria&#39;s mouth and it was clear that the wish had erased the events of the morning from existence, and probably Tammy and Bill both from existence as individuals (if the past history of the Stone&#39;s wishes at distorting reality and memories was any indication), there was very, very little either of them could do to escape their situation. Especially if Gloria had no memory of them.<br />
<br />
Bill simply slid into a quiet, mortified terror while Tammy continued to sob in their new home.<br />
<br />
Option 1: Bill and Tammy try to get Gloria&#39;s attention, with extremely poor results. That is until...<br />
<br />
Option 2: Wait, are there others in here? Who were those other two arguing voices in Gloria&#39;s mouth? Wait, Willow and...Rob Bolstrum!?</p>
