<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I smiled at Nicole’s question.  I wanted her to take an interest in the ring.  “Seemingly anything,” I said.  <br />
“Anything that I’ve tried so far.”<br />
<br />
“Other than making my clothes disappear and reappear, making everyone ignore that, and what you did to <br />
yourself and the apartment, what else have you tried?” Nicole asked.<br />
<br />
I had to think back on all the wishes I’d made.  “I made the apartment soundproof, too,” I said.<br />
<br />
“When did you do that?” she asked.  “Why did you do that?”<br />
<br />
“When you were pummeling me,” I said.  “I thought it would be a good idea to not attract anyone else’s <br />
attention.”<br />
<br />
She giggled.  “Yea, that was a good wish.  Especially since we went way past fighting,” she said.  Her <br />
expression changed from a smile to a frown.  “Joe, how are we going to keep this a secret?  Sooner or later <br />
someone will notice.”<br />
<br />
I understood her worry.  This wasn’t a situation that people would merely frown upon.  We would be outcasts.  <br />
We could even get arrested.  I figured I had the perfect solution.  “We can just wish everyone to ignore <br />
anything that might otherwise get their attention,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Like how you made everyone ignore me being naked?” she asked.  “I don’t think so, Joe.”<br />
<br />
I cocked my head in surprise.  “Why not?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Because messing with people’s minds might be too dangerous,” she said.  “We don’t know if it could cause <br />
permanent damage or something.”<br />
<br />
“Do you have another solution?” I asked.<br />
<br />
Her smile reappeared.  In fact it was what I referred to as her evil smile.  It wasn’t a malicious smile, but <br />
one that implied mischief.  “I might,” she said.  She got off the bed and ran to my door.  She looked back to <br />
see that I did not follow her.  “Well come on, lazy,” she said.<br />
<br />
I complied with her request and followed her.  She opened the door and ran to the kitchen.  I wasn’t sure what <br />
she had in mind.  She began to look all around the kitchen for something, but I had no idea what.  “Dammit, <br />
where is it?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“What?” I asked back as I entered the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Today’s newspaper,” she said.  “I left it on the counter.”  She looked at me.  “Your wish,” she said.  “Your <br />
wish made it go somewhere.”<br />
<br />
“OK, then.  I wish that the newspaper was back on the counter,” I said with a grin.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, babe,” she said.  She grabbed the newspaper and then looked back at me.  “Uh…sorry,” she said.<br />
<br />
I smiled at her.  “Don’t be embarrassed…babe,” I said.<br />
<br />
She smiled back at me.  She picked up the newspaper and showed it to me.  “This,” she said.  “This is my <br />
idea.”<br />
<br />
I walked forward and looked at the paper.  The main headline read, “KELLY MANSION TO BE DEMOLISHED NEXT <br />
MONTH.”  The Kelly family had been a prominent family in the area for many years.  However the last remaining <br />
family member died several years ago without any heirs.  The mansion was put on the auction block but no one <br />
bought it.  For the last year or so it sat there like a museum.  The bank that took it over and couldn’t sell <br />
was successful in getting the property condemned.  Their intention was to demolish the building, divide the <br />
land and develop it in some way.<br />
<br />
As I looked at the newspaper, complete with a picture of the once opulent home taking up most of the front <br />
page, I had an inkling of what she meant.  “You want us to be the heirs?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“No, silly, I just want the mansion and the grounds,” she answered.<br />
<br />
“But…why?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“You know why,” she replied.  “We’ve both felt like the world owes us something.  We had our parents taken <br />
from us for no good reason.  We didn’t do anything to deserve that.  Maybe that’s why you have this ring.  <br />
It’s a reward for the hurt we’ve suffered.”<br />
<br />
This didn’t sound like Nicole.  She sounded like she was drunk with power.  So I called her on it.  “This <br />
doesn’t sound like you,” I said.  “You sound like you’re on a power trip.”<br />
<br />
“I know,” she said.  “I feel liberated now, like I don’t have to repress things.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think I feel the same way,” I said as I crossed my arms.<br />
<br />
She said, “Hear me out.  And uncross your arms so I know you’re listening to me.”  Whenever I crossed my arms <br />
it meant that I was not open to suggestion.  She knew this all too well.  “They’re going to tear this place <br />
down.  It’s going to go to waste,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Yea, but didn’t it say something about development?” I asked.  “New homes and stuff?”<br />
<br />
“Stop interrupting!” she protested.  “I’ll get to that in a minute.  What we could do, with your ring, is take <br />
over the house ourselves.  Then we can fix it so that we don’t have to work and we can spend our time together <br />
doing all kinds of things.  We can travel, we can be philanthropic…we can be together.  With no interference <br />
or nosy neighbors or anything.”<br />
<br />
“So you want me to wish for us to have this house and enough money to never need to work again?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” she said.<br />
<br />
I had to admit that this sounded like a good idea.  But I was still wary of using the ring in such a way.  I <br />
had another question for her, too.  “But what about the bank’s plans for the property?  You said…”<br />
<br />
She cut me off and said, “Right.  You forget I work for that bank.”  This was true.  She worked for the same <br />
bank that owned the property, but she was just an assistant branch manager.  “Well when some bigwigs stopped <br />
in the branch last week, one of them was careless and left some copies laying around.  I happened to see a <br />
document that outlined their real plans.  They aren’t going to build houses or parks.  They’re just going to <br />
build another retail center, and the rest of the property is going to be converted into a god-damned country <br />
club!” she explained.<br />
<br />
“Oh ho ho,” I said.  “So they’ll give us commonfolk another place to buy things and stuff our faces and <br />
they’ll build another playground for the rich!”<br />
<br />
“Exactly,” she said.  “As soon as I saw that I panicked and shredded those documents.  I could have been fired <br />
just for seeing it.  The worst part of their plan is that they’ll cut down those woods that are near the <br />
mansion, which is going to kill a bunch of animals.”<br />
<br />
I looked back at the newspaper.  “Those fucking asshole bankers,” I said.  “Makes me wonder if they ever <br />
really did try to sell the place.”  Slowly I found myself agreeing with everything Nicole said.  I felt that <br />
we could be better owners of this place than the bank could.  It would also accomplish everything that we <br />
needed if we were to continue what we started.  I could see no way under which we would not.<br />
<br />
“Nicole, when’s the last time you didn’t convince me of something?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She grinned at me.  “Never that I can remember,” she replied.<br />
<br />
“Not this time either,” I said.  She let out a squeal and she jumped into my arms as her legs wrapped around <br />
my body.  Immediately I felt myself growing aroused.  I felt my erect cock poke against her.  “Huh,” I said.<br />
<br />
She said, “To think I was the one worried about doing this.”  We ended up making love on the kitchen floor.  <br />
Afterwards we were too exhausted to get up and so we fell asleep right there.</p>
