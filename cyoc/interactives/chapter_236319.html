<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christine had to stop and consider her answer to that question carefully. Compared to the lithe, sleek, powerful body she&#39;d found herself stuck in earlier, this form was incredibly restrictive and confining. Her senses were dulled, her peripheral vision gone, sound coming in almost as muffled as if she were covering her ears with a... pillow. Of course, compared to being a leopard, her human body was lacking in a lot of the same departments. That didn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t want to be human again. And if she couldn&#39;t get back to normal right away, at least she could be something close. Something in the vague shape of a person... Something that could be <i>treated</i> like a person... well, mostly. Bronwyn was right: at least she could speak. Speaking of which...<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can live with this for now&quot;, Christine said to Bronwyn. &quot;I mean, it&#39;s just for one night, and then I&#39;ll be back to normal, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot;, Bronwyn replied absently, but then her enthusiasm perked up. &quot;Yeah! Exactly! I&#39;ll take you straight to the Magic Shop first thing in the morning, and this whole thing will be over! You&#39;ll be human again before you know it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god for that. And besides,&quot; Christine said, &quot;with a little bit of practice, I think I might get the hang of moving around in this body.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that, Bronwyn felt the pillow in her arms wiggling of its own accord, and realized that she was probably hugging it a little too tight, given that there was a person inside. &quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed, and tried to make sure that Christine was well-balanced on the floor before finally letting go. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll leave you to it...&quot;, she said, embarrassed, as she gently propped the back of Christine&#39;s &quot;head&quot; up against the wall. Christine could see a deep red blush on the girl&#39;s face as she turned it away and shuffled out of the room.<br />
<br />
And then, thankfully, she was alone again. Christine was starting to kind of like that girl, after having very literally seen her perspective on all of this, but she still wasn&#39;t exactly planning on making friends with Bronwyn. The sooner she could get away from here, resume her normal life, and never see that girl again, the better. She tried to put those thoughts out of her mind and focus on the challenge that laid in front of her. She knew - or, at least, she hoped - that she wasn&#39;t going to be stuck in this clumsy form for long. But as long as she had to have this as her body, she wanted to have some control over it.<br />
<br />
Christine wasn&#39;t at all sure that she could actually learn how to &quot;walk&quot; like this, though. She couldn&#39;t even put one foot in front of the other - her &quot;feet&quot; (or really just one &quot;foot&quot;) were a soft, pliable mass of stuffing. But she knew that she certainly could move, and that was a start. She bent forward a little at the waist, and carefully lifted her upper body away from the wall until she was precariously balancing herself on the carpet. When she started to teeter too far forward, she bent her upper body back, with a flexibility that even her sleek leopard self had not had. Soon she was perfectly upright, and it started to feel natural.<br />
<br />
As humiliating as it was, she had to think of herself as a pillow, not as a human. The human features printed on her outside were of no real use to Christine now, even though she could move them easily. Only by ignoring the arms and legs she knew she still technically had, and focusing on the featureless pillar of stuffing inside that was the <i>real</i> her, could she maintain her delicate balance. She was a line segment, one that could bend itself and hop around and that was about it.<br />
<br />
She gave hopping a try, making sure that Bronwyn&#39;s bed was behind her. On the first few tries, she couldn&#39;t stick the landing and fell backwards onto the bedspread. Getting back up from there was a lot easier than trying to pick herself up off the floor. She practiced the jump until she could actually, reliably launch herself forward and land in a balanced, upright position. A few more little hops like that and she made it all the way across the room, stopping right in front of the bedroom door. Starting to get a little exhausted from all of this exercise, Christine let herself fall forward and rest by leaning against the surface of the door, relaxing whatever it was inside the pillowcase that passed for her muscles.<br />
<br />
<i>Now what?</i> were the words that came to her mind. Even if she could turn the knob and open the door that Bronwyn had shut behind her, she couldn&#39;t go anywhere like this. She wasn&#39;t free. She was essentially trapped in this apartment until some sort of magic stuff (which apparently was completely unreliable) brought her normal human body back to her. And having mastered her frustrating pillow body, there was really nothing for her to do now but wait for Bronwyn to come back. Bronwyn, the girl she was trying not to think about. The girl she wished she had never met. The only person who could get her out of this mess. And the one that had risked her own life, and her own body, to make things right. <i>Goddammit...</i> Christine thought, <i>am I starting to miss that girl?</i></p>
