<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ed spent the entire ride to school going through his phone and examining the pictures of himself in it. It seemed that his powers had also altered his history to make sure that no one saw a photo of him from recently and figured it out.<br />
<br />
It was beyond weird seeing the altered photos. Pictures that had previously held his skinny, baby-faced, pre-teen self had been replaced with progressively younger versions of his current form.<br />
<br />
There was one from a pool party last year, his body already far more developed than his friends, his shoulders broad and stomach lacking much, if any, baby fat. A bit of softness lingered in his cheeks but the signs of stubble reaching down his jaw and on his chin and upper lip far outweighed the youth. His arms and legs could have been mistaken for a man&#39;s with their thick outgrowth of hair. There was even a treasure trail poking out of his swim trunks!<br />
<br />
It went like that as far back as his photos went. At 10 he had the scruffy sideburns often present in teenagers, reaching to the bottoms of his ears, his jawline already beginning to develop its cut shape. At 8 he was taller than his best friend in the photo, his Adam&#39;s Apple poking out above his T-Shirt, peach fuzz covering his lip.<br />
<br />
And he wasn&#39;t the only one; Jacob&#39;s teen years could&#39;ve belonged to a college-age guy, his face marked with shadowy beard growth by the time he was 14, his chest possessing a triangle-shaped growth of chest hair stretching from nipple to nipple and reaching down into his pants in a thick treasure trail, which, if this morning was any indication, was only a taste of what was coming.<br />
<br />
Ed absently scratched at his stubble, marveling at the difference it made, especially when seeing them compared to his now-unmasculine father. A part of him felt guilty for stripping his dad of his masculinity but he knew he could always reverse it; or at least copy it back to the man at some point in the future.<br />
<br />
Either way, Ed felt a surge of pride looking at his reflection in the glass and seeing how manly he looked. If he was already a hairy stud at 12, how awesome would he be as an adult? After all it was clear he was nearly as hairy as Jacob, and he was four years younger! When he was an adult he&#39;d probably surpass his brother in manliness.<br />
<br />
These thoughts lingered for the rest of the ride and into his first class. Ed found it strangely difficult to focus; he&#39;d never been the best student but he wasn&#39;t a failure either. However, today he was itching to be doing something more than sitting in a chair, like his body had an excess of energy.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the hunger. When lunch rolled around he was pleased to find that his mother had packed him what would normally qualify as nearly three meals, but right now was barely enough to satisfy his hunger.<br />
<br />
Ed was also surprised to realize that this new version of himself was quite well-known around school. Apparently the increase in testosterone had led to Jacob becoming a record-winning athlete, and given Ed a high proficiency for them as well. Not to mention that girls seemed to be drawn to his mature appearance and developed form.<br />
<br />
The only thing that bugged him was the constant erections. He hadn&#39;t realized it before, but an increase in testosterone would logically enhance ALL male traits; including, obviously, his penis. What had previously been roughly three inches long and only useful for urination was now pushing 6 inches of meat--soft. Nothing particularly huge but nearly obscene for someone his age. Combined with the ever-present hardons that rose several inches above his too-small pants, Ed had very quickly learned how to jack off and ended up needing to do so half a dozen times.<br />
<br />
But for the most part he very much enjoyed his new self, feeling more confident than he ever had before. Whether it came from the excess hormones in his blood or the feeling of his chest hair against his shirt and stubble on his face, he didn&#39;t know or care. The only thing he felt he was missing was a body to go with his new masculinity.<br />
<br />
As much as he loved being a hairy pre-teen, his body felt strangely lacking. He&#39;d gained some development--broad shoulders, lack of body fat--but no real muscle, unlike Jacob. Adding a dash of muscle would really set him apart.<br />
<br />
It was this thought that led him to the baseball locker rooms at the end of the school day. He&#39;d thought long and hard over what kind of body he wanted; football players were usually strong but a bit too stocky for him. Swimmers were too lean. Therefore baseball was the go-to, and it didn&#39;t hurt that he&#39;d had his eye on one of the players for a while now.<br />
<br />
Erik Corin was a perfect pick. Buff but defined, nothing bulky but also obvious even under a layer of clothes. His pecs were large and flat, a washboard stomach perfectly complimented by bulging arms and legs. A senior, he had a jaw covered in sandy stubble not unlike Ed&#39;s, albeit less thick. All in all he was a handsome specimen and the ideal choice.<br />
<br />
The baseball player was alone in the room when Ed entered, only a towel around his wet hips, revealing a patch of sandy chest hair between his pecs. He looked up in surprise at the sight of the twelve-year-old, his brow furrowing in confusion. But before he could say anything Ed hurried over and wrapped his arms around Erik&#39;s waist, concentrating on the man&#39;s muscles.<br />
<br />
A warm tingling spread through his body and Ed jerked back, yanking his shirt off just in time to see the changes take place. First was his chest; the flat, hair-dusted plane suddenly began to push out, a crevice appearing as the slabs of muscle pressed against each other, rising until they formed a slight shelf. His hand crept to his stomach just as the flat skin grew a four-pack, then a six-pack. His arms swelled until the already tight sleeves on his shirt couldn&#39;t bear it and tore, revealing biceps and triceps belonging to a much older guy. His pants soon followed suit, revealing hairy, toned limbs.<br />
<br />
Ed turned to the nearest mirror and grinned at his new look. When he had woken up this morning he looked to be around fourteen or fifteen; the body hair and stronger jaw placed him as a mature middle-schooler. But with the new muscles adding a few inches and several years to his height, he wouldn&#39;t have looked out of place in high school--albeit a short high-schooler.<br />
<br />
He turned to look at Erik, whose eyes were glazed over. Then Ed realized something...</p>
