<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Panic washed over Dr. Jenkins as the dooming words left Mrs. Adams&#39;s mouth. He instinctively whipped his head around, searching even more frantically for some possible means of escape from this sinister puppy mill he&#39;d been brought into, but how do you escape from something that&#39;s already been needled into your veins? Instead, he only managed to get a better look at the many breeding pairs of the species he was about to be reduced to--common house pets penned up in pairs and exploited for their reproductive abilities.<br />
<br />
A jolt went through his lower abdomen, and the worried man doubled over and felt his insides churn. He looked down and gasped when he saw an astounding sight: his dick was gone, and instead there was new hole that he recognized from his own college-era sexcapades. He was a female now! And as scared and angry as he was, another emotion joined the fray as an unbearable lust bubbled up into a sexually irresistable torrent from down there. He couldn&#39;t stop himself: he reached down a finger to touch. He jerked and moaned in pleasure. Damn, why was he feeling so horny all of a sudden? He was in front of his own company&#39;s professional kidnappers right now!<br />
<br />
&quot;As you undoubtedly are already aware,&quot; spoke Mrs. Adams condescendingly, &quot;female dogs regularly enter into a phase that is, shall we say, especially conducive to mating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh yeah,&#39; thought Jenkins silently, &#39;I must be in heat.&#39; The thought was not comforting, but it didn&#39;t stop his bodily explorations for even a second. He was lustier than he&#39;d even felt as a human, and as long as he had hands and an obvious point of entry, he was going to take full advantage right there and right then.<br />
<br />
The changing man was already working his new equipment like a pro when he let one of his hands wander up to his chest. His moan seemed to take on a certain bestial quality to it when he discovered just how sensitive his nipples were now. He idly toyed with one of them even as his other hand fondled his crotch. It was when he let that upper hand caress his chest in a slightly more downward direction that he chanced upon another sensitive bump not far below the first. Was that ... another nipple? Jenkins looked down and found a number of these new growing in pairs all the way down his abdomen. Dogs have more than humans, of course, and his disgust in seeing his new nipples didn&#39;t stop him from running his free hand down over them, relishing the fresh points of stimulation down on his belly as much as he had enjoyed the pair on his chest.<br />
<br />
He was completely lost to the outside, totally absorbed in the newfound carnal pleasures he was discovering, when at last a feeling he hadn&#39;t really noticed reached a final peak that he couldn&#39;t ignore. There was something unfamiliar spasming around wildly past where his mind registered as the far end of his back. Still stimulating his she-parts enthusiastically, Jenkins turned his head to look back; there, he glimpsed something long, blonde and shaggy flipping in and out of his view. The luxurious golden furred tail swayed back into view again, and Jenkins whole body froze up as he realized what he had seen. A new reflex kicked some muscles into action and curled his new limb up against his ass, under his new clit, and back up close to where he had been trying out his new nipples. This is what it took for Jenkins to take both of his hands off himself and reach out for the new flesh and bone that had been advancing out from his spine for the past several minutes. The sight of a perfectly formed golden retriever tail--and the feel of his own hands grabbing at it inquisitively--brought Jenkins all the way back to reality and made him whine pitifully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it looks like someone&#39;s back from sexvana,&quot; said Mrs. Adams with a laugh. Jenkins looked up at her and growled. When he realized that none of the unpleasant words he had planned for her had made it down to his mouth, he focused harder and tried and again. Nope, his new doggy voice just wasn&#39;t up to the task. He whimpered again and looked back down at the inhuman appendage he was holding. He couldn&#39;t believe he had actually found out how it felt to wag one and watched it tuck between his legs. He was a well-studied man with a top-tier vocabulary, having spent years learning far more medical terminology than his simpleton coworkers could even pronounce, only to be reduced for the rest of his life to communicating simple emotions ... through one of these.<br />
<br />
A jolt in his hips made him let go of his long bushy tail, which stayed tucked up tight against his belly in terror. His legs, his knees, his heels and feet ... everything was aching and snapping! His new unmanly organs were burning with insatiable lust, but he couldn&#39;t even bring himself to touch them right now. He could only squint, feeling around in front of him, and crouch down until he could try to walk again. When it finally passed, he couldn&#39;t even look at himself. He could only stare forward through watery eyes and pant in exhaustion to recover from whatever it was that just happened. When he had finally almost caught his breath and built up a modicum of strength, a cold shiver rippled over his body from head to tail. It left him with a sense that his skin somehow wasn&#39;t quite right how he remembered it. Another shiver passed over and an itching feeling started on his belly. You&#39;d think that he might reach his fingernails down to scratch it, but no: an unexpected instinct brought his right foot up to pick at it with a toenail--and a much sharper toenail at that! He didn&#39;t even have time to think about it before another shiver passed through him and made him even more itchy. This time, Jenkins brought his sharp toenail all the way up to his ... shoulder ?!<br />
<br />
He shivered again and urgently got himself to look down. Fuck! He was hairy. No, not hairy--furry! It was a warm golden blonde, and when he shivered again he could actually see it grow longer. And his feet were different, too! His thighs were barely separate from his sides, his ankles were halfway up his leg, and his foot was long and tipped with a fully functional set of claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my, look at the marvelous shiny coat you&#39;ve grown in,&quot; gloated Mrs. Adams. &quot;You&#39;re pups will inherit the most beautiful color for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Already a new ache was throbbing in Jenkins&#39;s hands. No more fondling himself with those, it seems. The satisfaction he craved was going to be coming from a thick-dicked, ass-sniffing fleabag somewhere in these kennels. It was almost time to give up life on two legs forever, get his new cunt filled so he could think straight, and start getting ready to put these new nipples to use for The Zoo.</p>
