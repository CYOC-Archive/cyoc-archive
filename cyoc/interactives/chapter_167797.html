<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Are you gonna be ok?&quot; I managed to ask as I leaned over to rub her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... it just tires me out a bit is all. Well, that and I feel like I just had the best orgasm of my life 5 times in a dow just now.&quot; Millie had a satisfied grin stuck on her face, with a hint of pride showing through. It honestly looked cute as hell, but it wasn&#39;t the time for that. My girlfriend just layed a couple of god damn eggs! Egg! Like from a chicken! What the hell is going on with her? How can she not be freaking out about this? <br />
<br />
That and many more thoughts raced through my head. But even still, at the end of it all, she seemed fine, if not completely fine with this unexpected development. I guess my thoughts were pouring through my face because she gave me a sympathetic look &quot;come on now, I am perfectly fine ok. No need to worry that much. Just think of it as a kinky twist to our relationship. Plus I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s permanent or not either, so who knows, I could be back to normal in an hour even. So why not enjoy it while I have it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really can be too carefree at times you know Millie. But I guess nothing good will come from worrying too much about it since neither of us know the cause anyways.&quot; I kept stroking Millie&#39;s hair ans she leaned over laying her head on to my shoulder. As I held her, I felt an odd pressure down near my pussy. Sneaking a quick peak, I saw Millie secretly attempting to push one of her eggs into me. &quot;Um... what do you think you are doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Wait, wtf am I doing?&quot;answered Millie in a now surprised tone. She pulled back her hand, but the egg was still stuck part way into my pussy. &quot;Well dont just leave it there!&quot; I complained. <br />
<br />
&quot;I swear I didn&#39;t mean to. It wont come out, I didn&#39;t even know I was doing it too. Maybe it is time to get a bit concerned.&quot; Explained a panicing Millie. &quot;Its fine, I got it.&quot; I say as I reach down. However the moment I touch the egg, my hand slams down on it hard, shoving it with enough force to push it all the way into my womb. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I didn&#39;t mean to do that. My body just acted... I felt like I just needed it... needed it in me. Oh why did I even give in to it?&quot; Now I was panicing. I could feel the egg wobbling around inside of me as I moved about. If I am being honest, it is a massive turn on for me, but I can&#39;t explore that just yet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you get it out?&quot; Asked Millie. &quot;Maybe try pushing it out like a baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, because I have 10 kids of my own... seriously Millie, I have never been pregnant before, so hiw could i know what that feels like. You yourself should know that better than anyone.&quot; I sarcastically correct Millie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Uh... Yeah your right, I don&#39;t even know what I was thinking haha.&quot; Laughed Millie. I envy her ability to be able to laugh at this time. She has always been one to quickly adjust to things I guess, so this must be just the natural response for her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Although, maybe you could be considered pregnant now. Here, come look at this.&quot; Millie picked up another one of her eggs and lead me over to the kitchen.  Grabbing a bowl, she broke open her own egg and poured its contents into it. &quot;Here, can you guess what this stuff is?&quot; She asked handing me the bowl. <br />
<br />
It was not what I was expecting. There was no yoke, only a clear fluid, and a white cloudy fluid mixing together. &quot;Umm, egg whites?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, give it a sniff, you may find it familiar.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Eww. No, I am not sniffing it.&quot; I retorted. However I was met with a finger in my mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then taste it&quot; Millie said mischievously.<br />
<br />
It was not terrible. And I definitely had tasted this flavour many times before. In fact, it would be safe to say I was the leading expert on this taste. &quot;Is that your cum? You seriously are laying eggs filled to the brim with your cum?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it awesome!?! Apparently I can now only orgasm by laying eggs filled with cum! How cool is that!&quot; <br />
<br />
I could tell this was what she was the most excided about. She had been wanting something to be able to connect us together with. Now I had her cum filled egg stuck in my womb. She must be ecstatic. <br />
<br />
I shifted my weight a bit, and felt the egg move about with it. It seemed any kind of movement would bounce it around in my womb. Testing it out a bit more, I begin pacing around the kitchen. Sure enough, I can feel it move back and fourth in time with my stride. Maybe I was having a bit too much fun because all of a sudden I immediatly squatted down with my ass pushed up and back, and began peeing all over the floor. <br />
<br />
Millie of course had been watching me and had easily guessed what happened. She was holding back her laughter, rather poorly too. &quot;Did you just piss yourself! Hahaha, I&#39;ll bet while you were hopping around like an idiot, my egg accidentily pressed into your bladder didn&#39;t it! Oh my god this is hilarious!&quot; She finally couldn&#39;t hold herself back and started laughing as hard as she could. So hard in fact that she began clutching her sides and squatting down. However, her laughter abruptly stopped when she suddenly felt another clutch of eggs ready to be laid immediatly. Her laughter turned into moans of pleasure once again, as 5 more eggs were laid.<br />
<br />
Catching her breath, she looked over at me. My face had to have been aweful, because she came over right away. &quot;Sorry, I couldn&#39;t help it, it was funny&quot; she said trying to comfort me. I could care less though. My bigger concern is how I desperatly feel like I have to push sonething out of my pussy. I am 99% sure it is an egg too, but I really, really don&#39;t want to lay an egg. So I have been keeping it in this whole time, which has made it become kinda painful. <br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t even notice Millie squat down next to me, as I was so focused on not laying an egg. It was no use though. Ultimately I couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore. The moment I let go, an egg slid right out, quickly followed by 2 more. My eggs were somewhat larger than Millie&#39;s too, but more importantly, they were a lot heavier. My eggs weighed roughly 2x as much as Millie&#39;s. Millie of course wasted no time in snatching up an egg, only to poke a hole in it and slurp down its contents. &quot;Yes, yes, yes. I knew it! Your eggs are loaded with cum too!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I laying eggs too though?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, maybe because we are girlfriends who regularly drink each others cum like its water?&quot; Millie suggested. While she wasn&#39;t exactly wrong about our frequency, it didn&#39;t make sense. &quot;Hey uh, you got something on your butt you know&quot; pointed out millie.</p>
