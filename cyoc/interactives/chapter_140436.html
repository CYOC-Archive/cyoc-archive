Ben stood looking at the new reality he made for himself. His old estate long since replaced by the largest estate in the United States, Ben bent down to enter the gate that separated his world from the world of the puny folk. After a few years of renovation and more money than he knew what to do with, he continued to have growth spasms and growth parties that had him grow even larger than he had once imagined. Transformation.net was truly the center of his world, morphing reality to bend to his will. helicopter promotions of him towering over the normal world gave him world acclaim. He continued to dream of all the times tiny men message his toes, or women trying to ride his massive bod. He&#39;s done tons of modifications throughout the 2 years through transformation.net that gave him the perfect body he can imagine. Standing at a sweltering 300ft (11,800 tons) of meat he continued to waddle his way to his computer. He was high on his own success. While reviewing his next role in a film a director was joking that he played a role of a 500ft warrior prince. He saw his next chance to grow. He laughed with the director saying that anything was possible.  He giggled as he inputted the command to have him grow once more. The world best engineer tried their best to plan out the expansion of Giant Land but with their puny equipment couldn&#39;t have finished the house he had wished. He went about constructing a mountain from things he pulled from the land. Like an ogre, he lived in his hovel. the only thing the engineer did that helped him a lot was to create a radiator charger that was able to keep his computer charged no matter what. He spent a week cooking food to feed his new body like he has down so many times before. Leading the current moment where he clicked the button confirming his request. His incredibly tight 300ft clothing instantly blew off as he began to flex up causing him to explode bigger and better, stronger. <br />
The Director lounge on the chair as he awaited his appointment with Ben. Ben phoned him earlier about meeting him about his role as the Warrior Prince he imagined him to be. He wasn&#39;t quite sure what he should do accommodate the giant or what he even had planned. Even with the money, Ben upfronted for his own role. He didn&#39;t nearly have a cast or recording studio he could even fit him under. At least the Director confidently said CGI would complete his vision of a 500ft giant using Ben as a base. That was until he got a cell phone call. On the other side, an incredibly deep voice greeted him. He looked down to see it was Ben&#39;s number. Knowing Ben had a deep voice already, it confused the Director how such a deep voice was even deeper so he asked if Ben was feeling sick. The voice on the other side growing even deeper assured him that it was just him waking up for the morning and that he would be there in 2 hours. The Director puzzled asked once more if he was sure that he was okay. That was before he heard a giant groan and the line cut. Baffled the Director continued on his blissful existence. After 2 hours the Director was at his viewing platform so he can talk to the giant. Unusually Ben was nowhere to be seen. The Director slightly concern was about to call his main star until suddenly on cue his phone lit up. Ben was calling. Curious the Director put his ear against his phone. A voice so gravelly greeted him. &quot;MEGO- SAY- HI- GOT STUCK- ME SORRY&quot; the voice on the other side growled. The Director wasn&#39;t sure what he was hearing it sounded like Ben but also so foreign. He quickly asked where he was. The voice even more deep said &quot;STUCK&quot; before groaning again. The Director not assured at all decided to affirm his concern with the Giant. &quot;Hey, Ben if today isn&#39;t your day I understand, the biggest fucking person in the world I understand if you want to reschedule I can do that&quot;. NO. an unusually blunt response from Ben was uttered muffled as it was, was clear to the Director. &quot; NO STUCK NO MORE COMING&quot; strange the director thought. Ben suddenly spoke again to the director surprise &quot;LIFT LIFT PLEASE, I NEED MORE&quot; strange again the director asked how high he needed to adjust the lift, Ben said &quot;HIGH MAX BIG!&quot; no understanding how his main star sounded even deeper but sure in the response he did as he was told. the Lift was able to go up to 500 ft at the max. this was after they added a lot more reinforcement. He was hung up on as he was performing that action. Now completely unsure what Ben was getting at now worryingly stood awaiting the Giant. The Director got his answer when his lift shook violently. <br />
Still not seeing Ben anywhere but feeling his footfalls was both frightening and stunning. Where was Ben and how can he hear him. usually, his footfall would be heard when he was relatively closed by. BANG, Another more violent shake greeted the Director. the Director thoughts were rattled, he couldn&#39;t think straight. He still didn&#39;t see Ben anywhere. but why does it feel like a constant Earthquake? A few more footsteps later the shaking has grown so intense he was wonder what was going on. he was so focused on his phone he hadn&#39;t noticed a giant shadow descending around him and the whole studio lot.<br />
Ben stepping so ever carefully was wondering where the studio was he could have sworn that it was somewhere in this general area. It was the biggest studio in the United States. He tried to contain himself wonder if he would see the crane and the shocked face of the Director. but scanning the horizon he was still unable to see the director and his crane anywhere.  fiddling with the small phone in his palm was maddening but in his clothes, he was wearing was still on him he still felt presentable. He decided to take another step just so he can get another good look at his surroundings. <br />
The Studio plunged in darkness the Director fixated on his phone called Ben again. Only to receive a missed call from Ben. Ben craned down to look at the phone box seeing that the director is calling. turning on voice call Ben wondered where the studio was. Only to hear the panicked voice of the director from beyond. Below the Cloud cover of Ben&#39;s Chest, the Director called looking at the giant slabs of meat that was Ben standing before him. &quot;Ben you almost stepped on me!&quot; The giant body shook as the meat wall fell one step back. even though he was a full step back the slab of meat still was in front of the director and soon after some back to forth exchange. Ben eventually crouched enough just see the top of the nearby radio tower. Feeling a weird level of a headache he grabbed the lift and the director pulled them up in the sky.  &quot;Much better he thought&quot; straightening up his back and flexing. His clothes suddenly became incredibly tight around him. Looking at the director he placed the lift squarely in the folds of his pecs he was asked the director why he hadn&#39;t pulled the lift to its max. The Director stated that he did. Ben shuttered at the thought he might have miscalculated his size. asking for how high the lift was the director confidently said 500ft. Looking at his chest and his lift fondling the lift he couldn&#39;t believe just a week earlier he was eye level with the lift. The Director laughed through the phone, I say when I said a 500ft warrior prince I didn&#39;t expect to be greeted with an actor that needs to be shrunk down to fit with the vision I have in mind. Ben laughed as he quickly tried to dodge how he outgrew 500ft in a few hours. Eventually, he left the studio slightly embarrassed with the largest miscommunication in history.  Grabbing his computer he read his final stats; 2,500ft ( 6,781,200 tons).<br />
Let say the film that was gonna be produced changed to a Godzilla-like movie after the encounter.</p>
