<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Jeff, this is Aiden,&quot; his mom says, gesturing at the 12-year-old boy standing next to her. Aiden was pale, with freckles, and sun-bleached light brown hair.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks up at the kid, who is looking at Jeff in shock, like Jeff is some kind of freak, immediately making Jeff dislike him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, how old is he?&quot; Jeff asks, incredulous. &quot;I don&#39;t want some pipsqueak with me all weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aiden is 12, and he comes highly recommended,&quot; his mom says. &quot;He&#39;s the best soccer player on his team and considered one of the smartest and most well behaved kids in school.&quot; This makes Aiden blush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Jeff,&quot; Aiden says, &quot;I&#39;m responsible.&quot; The kid sounds like a squeaker too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, seriously, you want him to...you know?&quot; Jeff asks, thinking about his shower time. He doesn&#39;t want some little kid to see him like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, he&#39;s practically the same age as you, you&#39;re only 16,&quot; Dad says, causing Jeff to roll his eyes. &quot;We thought you&#39;d prefer this to someone older, and well...it&#39;s hard to trust a strange adult with you, you&#39;re kind of vulnerable, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Jeff can say anything, Mom cuts in, &quot;We have to go now, there&#39;s no time to find anyone else. Please be good for Aiden and listen to him. Just because he&#39;s a little younger than you doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s an idiot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff glances at Aiden, who is obviously trying to supress a grin. Great, the kid thinks this is funny. Jeff tries to think of an argument to convince him, but his parents are already getting on their knees to give Jeff awkward hugs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, don&#39;t leave-&quot; Jeff says, crawling to the door, but then it shuts in his face. Jeff turns, arm stumps pushing off against the floor to rotate him around.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, um, yeah, I&#39;m Aiden,&quot; the kid says. He must notice Jeff&#39;s glare, because he says, &quot;Um...I&#39;m going to setup my console, and uh...yeah.&quot; Aiden takes his large suitcase over to the TV and starts digging inside, pulling out a Wii. Jeff&#39;s parents had one of those when he was born, and Jeff remembered playing with it as a kid. In this timeline though, he probably never played video games, another thing that made him feel awful about his transformation.<br />
<br />
Jeff crawls over to his step to get up to the couch, and lays down. His shortened body only takes up two couch cushions, and Aiden sits next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to watch you play games without me,&quot; Jeff says, bitterness in his voice. &quot;Let&#39;s just watch TV.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, um, OK,&quot; says Aiden, then he turns on the TV. After a lengthy argument, they settle on watching Avatar: The Last Airbender. It&#39;s a kids show, which annoys Jeff, but at least it&#39;s better than the other crap Aiden suggested.<br />
<br />
 ---<br />
<br />
Aiden is very confused by the situation. Jeff doesn&#39;t recognize him, apparently, but Aiden knows him from school...except the Jeff Aiden remembers had full length arms and legs, and hands and feet. Jeff seems to think his situation is normal though, and his parents, when interviewing Aiden for the babysitting gig, told him Jeff has always been handicapped.<br />
<br />
Aiden doesn&#39;t believe in magic, but as they make it through the first couple episodes, he wonders if Jeff was like, cursed by a witch or something, because what else could explain Jeff and his parents treating this like normal?<br />
<br />
Aiden&#39;s position on the couch, next to Jeff laying down, gives Aiden a view of Jeff&#39;s leg stumps. They&#39;re smooth, no scars or jagged bones, so he doesn&#39;t think Jeff had surgery to cut them off. He looks up at Jeff&#39;s face, and sees Jeff looking at the TV. Around Jeff&#39;s neck is a dog collar, with an electronic device on the front, similar to the box on a shock collar. But his parents wouldn&#39;t give him a shock collar, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, um, what is the collar for?&quot; asks Aiden.<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes. &quot;It&#39;s to unlock and open the doggy-I mean, the handicap-accessible door ports that let me get through doors without being able to use door handles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden looks around, and sees a door that does have a little doggy door on the bottom. Aiden looks back at Jeff, and notices a prominent tent in Jeff&#39;s yellow and blue underwear. Aiden supresses a laugh, it&#39;s not funny, he tells himself; Jeff can&#39;t wear pants, and if I couldn&#39;t wear pants, people would see my boners all the time too.<br />
<br />
The boys take a break from Avatar so Aiden can make lunch. Aiden sets Jeff&#39;s plate on the table when it&#39;s ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aiden, how am I supposed to reach that?&quot; Jeff says. &quot;I thought you were smart.&quot;<br />
<br />
That annoys the younger boy, but he tells himself to be understanding, and sets the plate on the floor. When Jeff finishes his grilled cheese sandwich, he&#39;s got cheese and butter on his face. Aiden wipes it off with a paper towel without being asked.<br />
<br />
When Jeff turns to crawl over to his water bowl for a drink, Aiden sees Jeff&#39;s hard cock hanging down and swaying side to side in Jeff&#39;s underwear.<br />
<br />
The boys discuss the show quite a bit, and share a lot of laughs. Jeff admits, the show is still pretty good, even if he is too old for it. Jeff&#39;s erections keep springing up, pretty much any time he is reminded of his predicament, but he hasn&#39;t seen Aiden looking, so thinks maybe his briefs are hiding it, much to his relief.<br />
<br />
After dinner, they finish the first season, and Jeff decides to go to bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aiden, um, did they tell you you have to brush my teeth?&quot; Jeff asks, once again springing a boner as he thinks of his helplessness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, they mentioned it,&quot; Aiden says. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiden walks slow, allowing Jeff to keep up with him. Jeff is grateful, but it doesn&#39;t outweigh his resentment that this boy is &quot;in charge&quot; of him. Jeff is starting to think Aiden is familiar, like maybe the kid went to his school or something. He doesn&#39;t want to ask though.<br />
<br />
Aiden brushes Jeff&#39;s teeth, something he doesn&#39;t do nearly as well as Jeff&#39;s dad does, but it makes sense that he&#39;d need practice. Seeing those bright blue eyes looking at him, makes Jeff feel extra foolish, like he was a helpless baby. His cock twitches in his underwear at that thought. Jeff rinses his mouth out in the lever-activated water bowl and sink that are installed at floor level for him.<br />
<br />
Jeff heads to his bedroom, and Aiden follows. Jeff goes through the doggy door, and Aiden follows by opening the door all the way. Aiden asks, &quot;Do you need me to take your shirt off for bed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, just leave me alone kid.&quot; Jeff crawls into bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night,&quot; Aiden says, closing the door and leaving Jeff in darkness.<br />
<br />
Aiden sleeps in the guest bedroom across the hall from Jeff. The room has a doggy door on it too. As he tries to fall asleep, he can&#39;t stop thinking about all the boners Jeff springs. It&#39;s turning Aiden on too, and he decides to rub one out. He knows he shouldn&#39;t, that&#39;s what his parents always tell him, and Aiden tries to be a good kid, however, it&#39;s one thing he doesn&#39;t have the strength to obey his parents about. His orgasms feel too good to give up.<br />
<br />
After Aiden finishes, he feels ashamed for thinking about Jeff while masturbating. He realizes that Jeff probably has boners all the time because he&#39;s 16 and can&#39;t jerk off. Aiden shudders at the horror of being unable to pleasure himself. He couldn&#39;t live like that.<br />
<br />
Aiden resolves to help Jeff. He needs to find out what happened to the teen, and why he thinks it&#39;s normal. He will question Jeff, being as subtle as possible, and try to search the house when he gets the opportunity.</p>
