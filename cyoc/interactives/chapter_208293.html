<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Spencer Crosby had finally landed a job. He’d moved to Gilchrist under the assumption that he’d be working as an accountant at the local lumber consortium but after he’d gotten an apartment and all that rigmarole, he’d discovered they’d handed the job off to a relative. Nepotism had foiled all his plans.<br />
<br />
He’d been jobless for the last two months, was about to get kicked out, and had no where to go. Then an ad on Gregslist had caught his eye: Accountant Needed-20/hr. That kind of money could keep his landlord happy and himself fed!<br />
<br />
Then he’d tried getting dressed for the interview, which was tomorrow, and found out he’d moved up several sizes while laying about his apartment. How he’d gotten fat while starving was beyond him, but his jiggling potbelly was there nonetheless. Perhaps even worse was his shaggy black hair and unkempt beard. Spencer ran his fingers through both. If he wanted to ace the interview, he’d need to find a professional to get him looking sharp. And maybe shape his facial hair to hide that double-chin.<br />
<br />
Another quick perusal of the internet and he managed to land on a page for a professional salon. Grooming, nail clipping-Spencer glanced down over his gut to his toes and grimaced-and full washes. Massages to help with muscle tone as well, apparently. And, best of all, there was a free coupon! A one-time, full-service groom, one time only.<br />
<br />
He quickly made an appointment and was elated to find that they were available for a full session in an hour! It was a little strange-instead of asking things like hair type (curly or straight) it was asking him the length of his ‘coat’, so he left all of that blank. A text from his phone let him know that he had successfully scheduled an appointment.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Spencer was dressed (poorly) and on his way to the strip mall Booglemaps had directed him to. He didn’t have a car so it was a bit of a walk. Spencer needed the exercise anyways and being outside was good for him. He quickly walked the four blocks to the Gilchrist Shopping Center parking lot.<br />
<br />
Strangely, he was seeing a ton of people with dogs. There was a small dog park and it was absolutely full with families and their dogs. Spencer swore he walked past at least ten people walking their dogs in the four blocks he had to go to get to the shopping center. And they were beautiful dogs, not a mutt among them. He got distracted petting them all that it took him half and hour to walk something that would normally take him five minutes.<br />
<br />
The strip mall had definitely seen better days. An old hobby shop called The Dragon’s Den according to the big white and black sign that had likely been put up back in the 80’s was there. Sun-faded comics wilted in the sheet glass windows. Spencer took note of it because there were people playing cards and rolling dice inside.<br />
<br />
“At least there’s something to do around here.” Spencer chuckled to himself.<br />
<br />
Next to the hobby store was a Mexican food place called My Corona and next to that was a Chinese takeout called Jade Palace. Apparently it also had a buffet. Spencer made his way down the strip, checking out clothes stores like Second Hand Sam’s and ogling the old suits they had. Maybe one would fit him?<br />
<br />
The main theme of all the little shops on the strip was old and sunbleached. Spencer loved looking around places like these because he always found something cool. A rare comic or a vintage shirt that would be worth tons on cBay but the owners didn’t know. Or, in this case, couldn’t sell it at the price they wanted. <br />
<br />
A lanky man with long, greasy, dishwater-blonde hair was leaning against the bricks between The Dragon’s Den and Happy Clouds Vapes. He adjusted his thick glasses and scratched at his acne with one hand while taking a puff from his vape stick with the other. It was some kind of glittery pink vape juice. The cloud he puffed was a shimmery pink color as well.<br />
<br />
Strangely, his hair grew less greasy and more clean and flowing with each puff, pink highlights brightening the tips.<br />
<br />
”Hey.” Spencer waved.<br />
<br />
“Hi!” the man smiled and held out a hand. “I’m Kai.”<br />
<br />
“Spencer.” Spencer shook his hand.<br />
<br />
“You new here?” The man puffed again and his acne slowly cleared up.<br />
<br />
Spencer nodded, then winkled his nose as the twink blue vapor at him. “What’s that flavor?”<br />
<br />
“Twinkle Toes.” Kai winced, the wrinkles on his skin smoothing away, leaving a clear, youthful complexion. “Yeah, it sounds weird, but it tastes great! It’s like vanilla and peach and something glittery.”<br />
<br />
“Glittery?” Spencer grinned, not noticing his own form slowly thin, though he remained quite out-of-shape. “Is that a flavor?”<br />
<br />
“Champagne, maybe?” Kai took a drag and swished the vapor around in his mouth. His butt rounded and more pink dye filtered into his hair, though neither man noticed. “It’s nice.”<br />
<br />
“Huh.” Spencer eyed the twink and smiled. “Nice to meet you, but I have an appointment to get to.”<br />
<br />
“Too bad.” Kai winked. <br />
<br />
Spencer blushed and kept walking, searching for the salon. It was only when he stepped off the curb at the end of the strip mall that he realized he hadn’t even found the salon. There was a nail salon, but it only did weaves and the lady inside had no idea what he meant when he was talking about the free coupon. He double checked his phone.<br />
<br />
“Problem?” Kai asked, the cute twink causally strolling up to Spencer, flipping his hair out of his face.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, what’s this address?” Spencer held out his phone, not quite sure how he’d managed to snag such a hot guy’s attention. Blonde, blue-eyed, with smooth features and pink-dyed tips, the skinny thing was totally Spencer’s type. <br />
<br />
Kai took it in his dainty hands then smiled and pointed. “Looks like you’ve got a bit of a scheduling mishap going on.”<br />
<br />
Spencer looked to where the lithe twink was pointing.<br />
<br />
Pet Depot. Specifically, the little door on the side had the right address. Dog grooming. Spencer&#39;s heart sank. All that walking for nothing. He considered turning around and heading home, but he couldn’t help but be curious about what they had to offer. Not like he could afford a new pet right now, but looking at cute animals always cheered him up. Plus, it would be rude to make an appointment and not show up, right?<br />
<br />
“Wanna check it out? I always go in to check if they have any cool breeds.” Kai smiled kindly. “Plus I can hang out with you. How old are you, anyways.”<br />
<br />
“Erm…” Spencer looked at Kai uncomfortably. “Thirty.” He lied. “Ish.”<br />
<br />
“Ish?” Kai smirked and adjusted his glasses. “Well come on daddy, let’s find a dog.”<br />
<br />
Spencer blushed and walked over to the store.<br />
<br />
 The store was rather ugly, brick painted a sickly yellow with a cartoonish, blue-lettered logo on top. Very saccharine and definitely stood out in comparison to the rest of the buildings. Spencer took a breath and walked in through the side door.</p>
