<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Instantly Steve was standing next to Nina. &quot;Don't worry babe. I'm not going to burn up in the sun or <br />
anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina was aware of Keri crying over the white ash, already starting to blow away and disappear. She hugged <br />
Steve reflexively. &quot;Be careful. You heard the old man's story. The artist killed his wife, and you just saw <br />
Brad burst into flames. This stone is dangerous.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, relax. This is the coolest thing in the world. Isn't there somewhere you'd rather be? Like Rome? <br />
Paris?&quot;  Nina looked at him with worry and displeasure. She wasn't getting through to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back at camp. I just want to be back at camp, and away from that thing.&quot; She pointed her finger accusingly at <br />
the stone. &quot;Keri, let's get out of here,&quot; before she could turn to her friend, she saw the world swim and <br />
flash around her, and she was standing in camp, Steve holding onto her. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the?&quot; She lost her balance and fell over. &quot;Holy crap.&quot; She looked around, realizing Keri was still back <br />
there weeping on the ground. &quot;Steve, you have to go get her. Go get them.&quot; A moment later, Steve had <br />
teleported both Keri and Daniel back to camp along with them. Nina got up and ran to hug her. &quot;Honey, I'm so <br />
sorry. It's not your fault.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But it is!&quot; She was weeping as she spoke. &quot;I spotted the stone. If not for me..&quot; Keri was weeping so hard she <br />
couldn't even finish her sentence. Nina just sat and held her, the two of them rocking back and forth. <br />
<br />
Daniel was equally amazed to have appeared back at camp instantly. Had this really happened? This stone was <br />
real? As a man of science, the whole thing seemed ridiculous, despite the mounting visual evidence. He <br />
considered some more plausible explanations. Was this a hallucination? Was he dreaming? <br />
<br />
Steve, uninterested in the crying girls, appeared next to Daniel. &quot;So if you didn't wish to be superman, what <br />
did you wish for?&quot; <br />
<br />
Daniel considered his options, and lied, &quot;It all happened so fast, I didn't wish for anything.&quot; <br />
<br />
Steve let out a haughty laugh, &quot;really? That is unfortunate. The chance of a lifetime, and you missed it.&quot; He <br />
sat down on a folding chair. &quot;If you start walking, you might get back there before sundown, though it'll be <br />
hard to find in the dark.&quot; His posture making clear he knew he could take him back there in an instant, and <br />
yet had no intention of doing so. He looked back over to the girls, back to ignoring Daniel. <br />
<br />
By then Nina had calmed Keri down enough that they were both standing and hugging. &quot;I'm not saying he deserved <br />
to die, but he was a jerk. You're better off without him. You didn't want to end up one of his vampettes did <br />
you?&quot; Keri almost laughed. Which under the circumstances was quite an improvement. Nina wiped Keri's eyes <br />
before leading her to a folding chair of her own. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Nina. I'm okay. It was just a lot, you know?&quot; Nina still stood there, not willing to believe her so <br />
easily. &quot;Yes, I'm really fine. I'll be more fine if I can stop hearing your boyfriend fantasize about you <br />
shapeshifting for him.&quot; Keri looked over at Steve, and Nina caught a glance of recognition in his face. Keri <br />
heard her thought, and answered it immediately. &quot;Yes, really. So, can you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nina had almost forgotten about her wish in the commotion. She looked down at herself, unsure how the whole <br />
thing would even work. She thought about her flat chest, and how often she'd wished to have something, <br />
anything up top. Even just a little. She willed it and nothing happened, and then she pushed. Pushed against <br />
something in her mind that wasn't there before and immediately felt something change. Her shirt felt a tiny <br />
bit tighter, the shape in her chest slightly more pronounced than from her heavily padded bra alone. Was it <br />
really that easy?<br />
<br />
Nina thought, and pushed again, a bit harder. Her chest puffed and swelled up, still modestly, but enough that <br />
the new shape in her shirt was more than obvious to Keri, who offered her observation, &quot;I guess that answers <br />
that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Steve instantly appeared next to them, staring in hopeful delight at Nina's slightly but obviously enhanced <br />
curve. &quot;Baby. That's totally hot, do it again.&quot; Nina pushed again, her chest inflating to only a B or maybe <br />
small-C cup, but for someone who had been called flat chested all her life, they seemed mountainous. <br />
<br />
Nina's padded bra was pushed up and mis-fitting on top of her new shape, and she reached into her shirt to <br />
discretely unclasp and remove it. When she finished, Keri's face was distorted in disgust. &quot;Ohh please, enough <br />
Steve. You do not want them -that- big, it's just gross.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That is really annoying Keri. Get out of my head.&quot; Nina didn't seem put off at all, in fact she was looking <br />
back at him with bedroom eyes, which Steve quickly replied to. &quot;What do you say we get some privacy hon?&quot; Nina <br />
nodded as she took his hand, not realizing that an instant later they would be teleported far away.<br />
<br />
That left Daniel and Keri awkwardly alone with each other. Daniel spoke up first. &quot;Look, I know you've been <br />
through a lot, but we should probably pack up and get out of here. Who knows if those two are even coming <br />
back.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you're right. And we probably shouldn't mention this stuff. I mean to anyone. Who would believe us <br />
anyway right?&quot;</p>
