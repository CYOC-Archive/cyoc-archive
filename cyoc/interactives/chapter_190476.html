<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sasha and Duke were now only a few blocks away from Sasha&#39;s house, she felt like blushing now every time she looked over at Duke. Duke was also feeling happy for the first time in quite a while. She leaned in closer on Duke&#39;s arm as they walked over to the next street. When they reached the next street, Duke came to a stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Sasha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I say &#39;now&#39;, turn and use whatever magic you have for an attack, understand?&quot; Duke said to Sasha who nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOW!&quot; Duke and Sasha turned around quickly, and Sasha&#39;s magic hit a man who looked to be in his sixties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, you made me hit an old man!&quot; Sasha screamed with worry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just any old man.&quot; Duke said as the man suddenly sat up, Duke punctured him through the stomach making him crumble to dust.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was a vampire?!&quot; Sasha said with surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think my dad is trying to find me.&quot; Duke noted as he saw from the other side of the street were two older people who looked like they were only in their mid thirties, maybe a little younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, they want to hurt or kill you, don&#39;t let them.&quot; Duke said as Sasha nodded.<br />
<br />
The vampire girl ran towards Sasha who began fighting her with magic, while Duke was battling them, he glanced at the two of them and came to a realization.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen these two!&quot; Duke said as he defended himself against the male vampire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where?&quot; Sasha said as she continued to punching the female vampire.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw them on the streets before I met you, Margaret and Jared, they were...lost in the world, but they weren&#39;t evil or anything.&quot; Duke explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could&#39;ve....fooled...me!&quot; Sasha said as she knocked the female vampire, Margaret across the street while Duke destroyed the male vampire, Jared.<br />
<br />
Margaret considered fighting the two again, but just screeched at the two of them before dashing off.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Sasha shouted as she wanted to go after her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t! You can&#39;t go after her, if you did, she would only lead you to the rest. I won&#39;t let them hurt you.&quot; Duke said holding her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not some damn damsel in distress!&quot; She shouted back at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re not Sasha. You&#39;re one of the best damn wizards I know.&quot; Duke said as Sasha snickered at this remark, then kissed him on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you got me back on my good side.&quot; Sasha said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, I still have to tell my dad you are officially my boyfriend now, despite what I said to him before.&quot; Sasha said.<br />
<br />
****************************<br />
<br />
Margaret almost stumbled back to their hideout where Miro Tepes was conversing with Donovan when the two of them saw her return battered and bloody.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speak, what news do you have?&quot; Miro asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re....son....he.....and a....an ally did this....to me.&quot; Margaret said barely getting her words out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some lowly human did this to you?&quot; Donovan questioned her, now holding her by her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.....a wizard girl......there may be others.....&quot; Margaret said before she felt her body die again by Miro&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could&#39;ve gotten more information out of her my lord.&quot; Donovan argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! That street whore just confirmed our suspicions. There are wizards here and my son is aligned with them. To send anymore lowly vampires would be cattle to the slaughter. No, I think it&#39;s time we send out the five.&quot; Miro said to Donovan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now? But my lord, we still have to...&quot; Miro glared at Donovan who knew not to disobey his master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Donovan replied as he went to a room where five unique vampires were stationed.<br />
<br />
Two of the vampires were a middle age man and what looked to be his 18 year old daughter who were making out with each other. One of the vampires looked to be a man dressed in samurai attire, but was blind. The fourth was a middle age woman who was dressed in revealing clothing and was gazing at herself in a mirror. The fifth one was a little girl who looked to be only less than 10 years old, possibly 8 and had curly red hair that hung over her eyes, she sat furthest away from the others, or they were sitting away from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you all, it seems you&#39;re needed sooner than we thought.&quot; Donovan said with some reluctance in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, what&#39;s the matter Donovan? Did you want to get in on the action first?&quot; The vampire woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up Natalia.&quot; Donovan said under his breath. &quot;We&#39;ve learned that there are wizards in this city, we don&#39;t know how many there are, but we know that one has aligned themself with Duke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Figures, never liked the little brat, too much of a wishy-washy.&quot; The teen girl said while caressing her father&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you had a crush on him once, Cassidy?&quot; The teen vampire girl&#39;s father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please daddy, it was only for like three seconds...before I turned my eyes back to you.&quot; Cassidy said with much lust in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet you two. It&#39;s very likely that Duke has some teen wizards aligned with him. So that means that one of you will have to go to school, or at least mingle with some of the teens.&quot; Donovan instructed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gross, high school again. That sucks.&quot; Cassidy said rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Natalia, maybe you can see if one of the parents knows about their magic?&quot; Donovan told Natalia.<br />
<br />
&quot;A mother or a father?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care which.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The mother it is then, maybe I&#39;ll get lucky and have a lesbian woman on my side.&quot; Natalia smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Donovan, are you forgetting something?&quot; The one in samurai garb spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I Ken? What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are vampires, how are we to find these wizards or the dhampir during the day?&quot; Ken asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you asked.&quot; Donovan brought out a tray of bottles to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You brought us beer?&quot; Cassidy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, these bottles contain magic that will give you each 24 hour resistance to the sun. They&#39;ve been prepared for only you five.&quot; Donovan explained as each of them took a bottle.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about myself and the child?&quot; Ken asked as the little girl growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will both analyze our enemies, learn their strengths as well as their weaknesses. Little Ann, you are the last resort if they prove to be difficult in battle, you may resort to your...preferred form.&quot; Donovan explained as the little girl grew a vicious grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now toast you five, to the downfall of the wizards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To the downfall of the wizards!&quot; The five of them shouted as they took their drinks.</p>
