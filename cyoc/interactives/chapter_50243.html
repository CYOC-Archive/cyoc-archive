<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff saw people start to walk into the building, hoping that his parrents would somehow find out that he was a bra. He saw many women pass by him, hold his tag, but they soon left. He was relieved to find that many women didn't buy him. This gave him hope that he might stay here long enough for his parrents to get here. He saw a few grils which he recognized from school; this was the most popular store in town. He was surprised when he saw his girlfriend. She was looking through the bras, when she Jeff hanging on the rack. She pick up his tag and said: &quot;Wow, just my size.&quot; and she picked Jeff up. <br />
<br />
Jeff was in panic. If he was bought, and his parrents ever found out about his transformation, they would never know where he was. He felt himself being scanned by the clerk, and then stuffed into a bag. The ride to his girlfriend's house was pretty uneventful, which gave him more time to think. What was he going to do? His parrents couldn't just go to the store and say &quot;I'm looking for a paticular bra, do you know who might've bought it?&quot;. They'd never find out where he was. Jeff felt the bag being lifted up, and then heard his girlfriend talking to her parrents. <br />
&quot;Hi Tina, did you find what you were looking for?&quot; he heard her mom say.<br />
&quot;Yep&quot; Tina said, &quot;Exactly what I was looking for.&quot; Tina took Jeff into her room, and took him out of the bag. <br />
&quot;Ugg, I've been wearing dirty bras for too long now.&quot; she said, as she took off her shirt and then her bra. She cut off Jeff's tag, and unclasped his hands. He felt himself stretched as he felt his girlfriend's brests were being pushed inside of him. As a human, this was the exact thing he would've liked to do, since he had never seen, let alone feel, a girl's breasts. Now they were completely inside of him. He enjoyed the moment for just a seccond. He could feel her warm flesh against his head. He could feel her nipple press against him. For just a seccond, he wasn't in pannic but pleasure. This wasn't what he'd imagined it was like to be worn, although for the past few hours he'd been thinking about how to turn back insted of what it feel like to be worn. But he quickly snapped out of it when he realized that he had to think of some way to get out of this. As much as he enjoyed being worn, he couldn't spend the rest of his life like this. <br />
<br />
Tina threw a shirt on, and continued on the rest of the day as normal. She walked out of the room, and decided that she wanted to go to her boyfriend, Jeff's house. She told her mom she was leaving, got in the car, and drove to Jeff's house. <br />
<br />
Jeff veiw was cut off as his girlfriend put a shirt on. He could feel her walking as her breast jiggled inside of him. He couldn't help thinking that with her brests inside of him, he felt......complete. She completed him. It calmed him down, gave him peace, and even allowed him to think more clearly. He felt the jigling stop, and a car engine start. He realized that Tina was going somewhere. The car ride was uneventful, and although he knew he should be thinking about how to escape, but he just wanted to relax. Just to do his job, hold up his girlfriend's mammeries, and let them complete him. Although it calmed him down from his pannic, it was starting to fog his brain, instead of letting him think clearly as it did at first. Now it was harder to think, and easier just to relax. <br />
<br />
Sarah rang the door bell to Jeff's house, and Sarah answered the door. <br />
&quot;Oh......Hi Tina&quot; Sarah said, remembering Jeff's incident yesterday. <br />
&quot;Hi, is Jeff arround?&quot; Tina asked. <br />
&quot;Ah....No, he's a....with some friends.&quot; she siad. <br />
&quot;No he's not&quot; Sarah's mom came to the door. &quot;He went to bed early last night, and he's still sleeping upstairs. Why don't you go wake him up.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff heard a doorbell ring, and then heard people talking. <br />
&quot;Oh......ainf iadsf&quot; he heard. The words weren't making sense! He tried to concentrate, but he couldn't make the words out. He knew the voice was his sister's though, and figured that he was at his house now. <br />
&quot;ihafi, iuroewr eriwheoriu woieur?&quot; He heard his girlfriend say. Being worn had cause him to forget the English language. Now he'd never escape. <br />
&quot;ashd.....sha ashdksa...asdhajs oqiwuew xzncbzx.&quot; He heard his sister replie. Then he heard his mom talking, and then more jigling. He felt his girlfriend go up some stairs, and then he heard his girlfriend yelling. <br />
&quot;alskdj kdjasd! Asdlkj dkjasd jklasjd!&quot; Jeff couldn't understand anything, not even his own name. He had forgotten eveyone's name, but he could remember who they were. He was worried at what might happen. Then....</p>
