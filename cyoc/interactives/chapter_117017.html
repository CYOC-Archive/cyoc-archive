<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;stop this at once!&quot; as the knights back away from you that you looked for the source on where the voice was coming from. looking up to the sky that you saw a giant shadowy looking figure form in the center area of the sun. to your surprise that you Suddenly saw what appeared to be another dragon in the sky with all assorted dragons from what you could tell of. some of them were wearing armor, like the ones that had there swords drawn out to you while others looked liked they were wearing robes as they came in different sizes and colors.<br />
<br />
most of them rain down from the sky before the one that was in the center area of the sun descended in for a landing. you were both shocked in awe while paralyzed with fear that most of the People were screaming and panicking, as well as the scattered  guards as the dragons landed near the gates. You wanted to help calm down the people, but you weren&#39;t sure after how all things considered happened. Suddenly you felt something tugging on your tail that you looked back to see a few small, but young dragons pulling it.<br />
<br />
&quot;why do you define this beast, even tho it&#39;s one of your kind and all?&quot; A knight asked the large red dragon as it looked like the captain of the guards, before being holt by what looks like a dragon in a knights armor. &quot;because we an alliance treaty with your king to join our kind with you humans. have you forgotten about that one law we dragons made on the treaty? if any of my fellow dragon kind, no matter how big they may be, or how small they come, young or old, that are threatened by any human way, then the one that made the threat is hear by threatened back in our own way. do you remember the treaty now captain?&quot; the dragon said back the captain of the guards while threatening him.<br />
<br />
&quot;my apologies, but this young dragon here.&quot; the captain said before being interrupted by the dragon. &quot;besides, I observed the whole situation here. this young dragon here was merely transported here by magical means as this one here is disoriented. Afterwards a young human of yours witnessed and screamed in response, most likely not knowing what to make of it.&quot; the dragon said while moving to your side.<br />
<br />
with in a few moments that the captain and the guards disbanded as the dragons soon turned towards you and asked in a soft tone of voice so you weren&#39;t frightened by this. &quot;Are you hurt?&quot; You hesitated to answer as you were catching your breath that you soon gave your response. &quot;thank you, but Surprisingly I didn&#39;t think so.&quot; you responded as some of them had there attentions on you. &quot;there&#39;s a fountain near by, why don&#39;t you go over there and cool off there.&quot; heading to where the dragon had told you that you followed on its directions and soon found the fountain it was talking about.<br />
<br />
when you walked up to it, and began drinking from it that When you were done finished drinking from it is when you stuck your head inside the water, and shook it around while hoping you were just having a bad dream. when you withdrew your head from the water However is where you were still a dragon that you looked at your reflection from the fountain&#39;s water, but this time you could see yourself without having any sort of danger nearby, or so you thought as You began shaking your head side to side. &quot;No, no! this isn&#39;t real, this can&#39;t who I am! how!?&quot; You said as you paused when you were recalling your memories.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a surge of anger coursed through your body as you felt something building up inside your mouth. You eventually soon got to the point where you couldn&#39;t control it any more that you shot a giant plume of fire, as if by instinct from your mouth while You roared into the sky above you. Instantly, it was rapidly followed by a burning red headache when the dragon from before approached you. &quot;Impressive rage there, you&#39;re going to need it before too long there dragon.&quot; it said as you finally by now figured out that it came out as A dark, and deep voice while it was coming from behind you.<br />
<br />
You turned around quickly to see it standing there with its looking knights. You stepped back, but you soon approached him as you then ask him. &quot;Who are you? How did this happened?&quot; You asked him as he nodded his knights off, as if to talk to you privately. &quot;I know very much about you my friend, but I see you know not of me. You&#39;re not like us dragons here as your no originally dragon, but one of those human. you have managed as to find our world, due to your curiosity that someone has pulled you through the fabrics of your dimension and brought you here in ours. your body seems to have chosen it&#39;s own form, and I have to say from my perspective that it suits you perfectly. Anyways my name is Igneel, and as you can see here, i&#39;m the dragon king of this world dragon kind. and you are?&quot; he said as Igneel asked.<br />
<br />
you soon gave him you name as he then gave you a new name. &quot;I see, well that&#39;s one of those human names, you&#39;ll need a dragon name. how about Flare.?&quot; he said. &quot;ok, so my name is now Flare, and it all happened to me all so fast, but the main thing is that I&#39;m human and not a dragon.&quot; You said. &quot;I see. well then, I&#39;ll try to explain what happened to you the best way that I can, but I need to know your exclamation so I can talk it over with that human king of theirs.&quot;<br />
<br />
he said as you explained everything to him as to what happened that it almost wanted to make you cry. &quot;ah, You poor thing. I can see why you were acting so confused here. tho I hate to go into the castle to speak with that human that I must insist of you as to  follow me at once.&quot; he said as you tilt your head with a question. &quot;um, ok, but why?&quot; you asked. &quot;that human wizard of theirs might be able to find a way to transforming you back into your human form, but I wouldn&#39;t get to comfy as to get your hopes up, because if they can&#39;t find a of changing you back into one of them, then you&#39;ll be most likely be stuck as a dragon for life. I would like it if you were to live with one of our own kind as we&#39;ll teach you things in ways that can be tot to a human.&quot; he said as the dragon armored knights came back that you notice one of them was a blue dragoness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate the offer, but why the generosity? I mean, it&#39;s just that I feel like I should do something in return after all of that.&quot; You said. &quot;Well there&#39;s your story for one reason, two, there&#39;s the fact that dragons aren&#39;t seen as being nearly as nice to humans as you just found out, and then there&#39;s the fact that your in the body of a dragon. so with that in mind that I think I should reward you in that regard. now please, follow me.&quot; he said as You did just that. while you were walking up to the castle that a couple of the dragon guards accompanied the two of you and into the castle while you started to think about that blue dragoness knight.</p>
