<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"Wake up Anna," my mom said gently shaking me awake.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes I noticed that my sheets were twisted around my leg and I was spread-eagled across my bed. I blushed 
and said, "Morning Mom," in a low voice.</p>
<p>My mom smiled and said, "Morning princess. I see you've had your first wet dream." Her eyes went down to my crotch.</p>
<p>Looking down myself I saw that my pajama bottoms were wet and I blushed. "I didn't mean to," I said thinking that I had a little 
accident.</p>
<p>My mom laughed and said, "It's perfectly natural." At the blank look on my face she said, "Oh you thought you had a bit of an 
accident." She smiled and continued, "A wet dream isn't having an accident. It's when you dream of something that gets you sexually 
excited and the result is what you see. It's part of growing up."</p>
<p>"So I didn't have an accident?" I asked hoping that I wouldn't get in trouble for it.</p>
<p>"You didn't have an accident," my mom said smiling and putting a hand on mine. "So was it a boy or girl you dreamed about?"</p>
<p>"Mom," I practically whined.</p>
<p>"Alright you don't have to tell me," my mom said raising her hands up. "Just remember that I'll always love you no matter your 
sexual orientation. I do want to know one thing though. Did it seem real?"</p>
<p>Looking down I said, "It was just a dream but it did seem real." I was surprised that my pajamas and underwear disappeared leaving 
me completely naked. I looked up at my mom who was smiling. Didn't she see what had just happened?</p>
<p>"Don't look so afraid," my mom said with a little laugh. "I know that you're naked but it's only in your mind."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" I asked covering myself up with my sheets.</p>
<p>My sheets disappeared as my mom says, "Right now we're in your mind. You see people in my family have the ability to project 
ourselves into someone's mind. It usually begins to manifest around thirteen. I believe you projected yourself into someone's mind last 
night resulting in your wet dream. As you can see this seems real but it's all in your mind. Now you won't have the level of control that I 
do right now. You'll need to practice and eventually you'll reach my level. Right now you'll just be able to enter one person's mind at a 
time in real time."</p>
<p>"Real time?" I asked confused.</p>
<p>"There are different levels of time compression," my mom said. "Real time is just like the time outside meaning that a minute in here 
is a minute out there. There's no compression with real time. Now when the time is compressed we use a year in here to a month, a 
week, a day, an hour, a minute, or a second out there. As you can imagine a year to a month is the least compressed while a year to a 
second is the most compressed. With the highest compression you could spend sixty years in here and only a minute will pass out 
there."</p>
<p>"What can I do with this?" I asked getting a bit excited.</p>
<p>"Right now all you'll really be able to do is project yourself into someone's mind and have just a bit of control," my mom said waving 
her hand. The scene shifted from my room to the middle of a forest and both me and my mom were naked. "If you project yourself into 
someone's mind while they're asleep or someone who is weak willed you'll have more control maybe having close to total control. You'll 
be able to choose to be seen or not but there are those that will be able to sense you until you gain more experience." The scene 
shifted back to my bedroom and we were both dressed once again. I looked at my mom as she said, "Now go take a shower. We'll be 
leaving for the reunion in a few hours."</p>
<p>I was excited about the reunion. Every year our family got together in one of the cities in which we lived. This year it was my 
hometown of Kolkata, North Dakota at the park. I looked forward to seeing my cousins Jack and Jill. They're twins and eight years old 
now. I have other cousins but they're seventeen and older and a couple aren't that nice. As long as they weren't mean to me we got 
along, barely. Once I was done with my shower I put on my underwear and a white and pink cap sleeve dress with carnations on it. I 
put on a pair of white tights and then a pair of black dress shoes. I was able to have a little breakfast before we left.</p>
<p>As soon as we arrived at the park we went over to the old bandstand where the rest of our family waited. I had a good time with 
Jack and Jill playing tag and hide and seek. Jill had brought along some dolls and we had a little tea party with them Jack joining us 
willingly. He was very close to his sister and would often play with her even playing dress-up with her. Aunt Ida and Uncle Charlie had 
sat Jack down and asked him about it. He had said that he liked dressing up in Jill's clothes but wasn't sure if he wanted to be a girl or 
not. For now they were taking a wait and see attitude.</p>
<p>It was evening when things went wrong. A couple cars with flashing red and blue lights pulled up and about eight people got out. My 
mom looked worried and then the shooting started. My mom was the first one shot and instinctively I grabbed Jack and Jill and went 
behind the old bandstand. I peeked out and saw the rest of my family on the ground not moving. I didn't know if they had been shot or 
were just on the ground trying to avoid being shot. I don't know how long the shooting went on but it seemed like forever to me. Jack 
and Jill were scared but they kept quiet during it. Finally it stopped and a lady came over to us. "We have three children over here 
Frank," she said over her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Get them over to the car Mary," a guy who had to be Frank said. "Don't let them see what happened. They're probably traumatized 
enough already. We don't need to be adding to it right now."</p>
<p>As we were being led to the car I had the idea of what Frank was talking about. We were the only ones left alive.</p></p>
