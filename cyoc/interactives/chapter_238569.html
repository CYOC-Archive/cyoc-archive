<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cupid soon realized a problem. While his aim was true the boy&#39;s parent&#39;s line of sight had shifted when Nougat had panicked. As a result, their direct line of sight was skewed slightly toward them when he fired. From where they were staring it was clear what they had seen when the arrows hit them. For Sam, he was looking at the barn&#39;s best cow Nessie. Martha on the other hand was looking at Susie, the farm&#39;s prized sheep.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Did it work?&quot; Jamie asked. It looked good as the two began walking toward each other. His smile dropped when they passed each other and opened the stalls. &quot;Cupid what&#39;s going on?&quot; Jamie asked. Turning to the fairy he could see Cupid was nervous and scratching the back of his head. &quot;Well, my arrows did hit them, but they weren&#39;t looking at each other&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Jamie then saw his dad approaching a cow. he adverted his gaze when the man&#39;s pants and underwear dropped. The ten-year-old inadvertently saw his mom licking a sheep&#39;s nether regions. He was forced to look back at Cupid and do his best to ignore the moans from his parents. &quot;okay, just hit them again when they&#39;re looking at each other then. That&#39;ll fix it right?&quot; Jamie didn&#39;t like when Cupid sighed. &quot;That is going to be an issue. You see when my arrow hits an animal of the same species they fall in love. However, if my arrow hits animals of different species that can&#39;t mate, it fixes it so they can&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Jamie then looked to where his father was and was shocked to see large balls covered in brown fur hitting the cow&#39;s udder. Sam&#39;s cock had now filled up the cow&#39;s pussy. The next few seconds felt like an eternity. His father&#39;s pelvis was coated in thick brown fur as his rear grew. Instead of fat, it was pure muscle. His spine then extended into a long ropy tail as his thighs grew. The brown fur soon began spreading out across his body. Below his knees, his legs shifted. To Jamie, it looked like his ankle had become a second knee or something. His nails swallowed his toes becoming large hoofs. While this happened his torso began to barrel out, the fat melting away as the changes spread down his arms. By now the man&#39;s shirt was in tatters as his arms became his front legs. Like his feet, his nails absorbed his fingers and became hoofs. Next, his neck thickened to match his body. Sam&#39;s once trimmed hair became a wile main down his neck. It got so long in the front that it covered his eyes. Above his growing ears two nubs pierced through the fur. They grew into curved horns as his face pushed out. His nose sunk into his muzzle as his mouth lost its canines. Jamie saw a bull in a ruined shirt where his dad had been.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom stop...&quot; Jamie was cut off when he saw his mom rising. From the broken zipper on her pants, a large pink cock dripped with need. Like his father Martha&#39;s changes only took seconds but Jamie felt like they took forever. Her panties snapped off as furry grey balls finished growing from where his pussy once was. Like his father, Jamie&#39;s mother began to take on more similarities with his new lover. His clothes tore apart as he changed. Black wool grew from his darker skin. His spine extended into a short fluffy tail. Down his arms and legs, the changes progressed. Once at the knees, the wool became short and grey. Soon the nails on his hands covered his hands and feet while his ankles raised. From behind his stretched ears, two dull yellow horns grew and wrapped around until they poked underneath the oval shapes. His eyes then elongated on the horizon. The final step was his nose sinking into his new muzzle.  <br />
<br />
Jamie was about to burst into tears. He wanted his parents to get back together. Now though he was like an orphan. Cupid flew in front of his vision. &quot;hey sorry about this. a bringer of love this is an unfortunate thing&quot; Cupid gestured to the animals his parents had become. &quot;is there anything you can do?&quot; Jamie wiped the tears that began to roll down his cheeks. &quot;well kind of.&quot; he then pulled out two arrows that looked slightly different. &quot;get them to look at you and I&#39;ll hit them with this. Best case scenario they become human again, worst case they&#39;ll love you&quot; Cupid then flew across to get a good view of the two animals.  <br />
<br />
Jamie tried for several minutes to get his parent&#39;s attention. It was only after they finished mating that they looked at their son in shock. His father was the first to try to speak. He was shocked to be able to moo instead of talking and stuck on all fours. Likewise, his mother was confused at this too but also about the odd weight between his legs. Cupid then shot the two with some arrows.  <br />
<br />
Jamie watched as his parent&#39;s forms altered once again his father&#39;s barreled torso shifted to a wide v shape. His front legs once again became arms with his hoofs separating into two fingers and a thumb. His spine rearranged allowing him back on two feet. Sam&#39;s bovine face became more expressive as thick dark brown fur grew from his pelvis and crotch. Martha was going through similar changes. His hooves spread giving him all five digits back. He now has a buff v shape to his torso but not nearly as big as Sam&#39;s. Across his muscles torso and arms the woll thinned considerably. It now looked like he had thick curly body hair at first glance. Even his face became more human as his back readjusted. Standing on two hoofs he now had barely any signs of his muzzle on his grey face. He now had a goatee on his chin. Sadly this is where the changes stopped.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot; Jamie asked bewildered at the sight of the two males. Cupid sighed as he pinched his nose between his fingers. &quot;They essentially became myths based on the animals they fell in love with&quot; Cupid then heard the satyr scream as it looked down. The Minotaur then took notice of Cupid and swiped at him. &quot;You, what did you do to us?&quot; Sam said.  <br />
<br />
Martha meanwhile was back against the wall when Susie came over to him and began licking his cock. he stifled a moan as more cum came out of him. he stumbled out of the stall before closing it. Cupid was fed up with the Minotaur and flew to the rafters. &quot;look this isn&#39;t a picnic for me either. I&#39;m never going to get my payment and now I have to explain to Mother Nature why there are two new myths here. She&#39;s going to talk my ear off,&quot; Cupid sighed. &quot;what do you mean payment?&quot; Martha asked.  <br />
<br />
Jamie then got off Nougut and hesitantly approached them. &quot;it&#39;s all my fault&quot; Jamie then explained how he encountered Cupid while riding Nougut and how the fairy had said he could get his family back together in exchange for marshmallows. Martha and Sam were shocked to learn the truth. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I never meant this to happen&quot; Jamie was shocked to be hugged by his parents. Cupid wasn&#39;t however. He had used his family love arrows hoping to counteract the mistake. In addition, they also helped keep his parents loving him. &quot;it&#39;s okay honey. It&#39;s just so much to process&quot; Sam said. Jamie was relieved his parents had forgiven him. &quot;now what&quot; Jamie looked up at Cupid. &quot;well there are a few options&quot; Cupid flew down to just out of reach of Sam. Cupid then listed the options they could take, in exchange for the rest of Jamie&#39;s marshmallows after they picked one.</p>
