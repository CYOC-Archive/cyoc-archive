<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The party went well, and Clara made a point to be there to shake hands with every person that she could, human or Animalian. Some left from doors other than the one that she was at, so she couldn&#39;t personally say goodbye to everyone. However, that didn&#39;t change her thoughts on the party&#39;s success. It allowed them to better integrate Animalia with at least Lyre and with some of the local and in state businesses having some positive interest in things, that was to be a success. However, with many of what she was told being state and even national media coming to see the party, Clara was fairly curious on what the responses were to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And hopefully they&#39;re good responses,&quot; Clara thought as she made her way into what was her office as Animalia&#39;s mayor.<br />
<br />
Like many Animalians, Clara at times had a great deal of puzzlement at how human society had had so many disagreements that either lead to wars or to at least very ugly arguments, but in working with the men from the lab and from Lyre&#39;s city government she had learned that humans often simply disagreed on what was best for either humanity as a whole or for their country in particular. The harshness that these disagreements took on was ultimately the result in the firmness in belief or the limited resources available to one side, ultimately leading to battles that were most akin to the territorial fights among mundane animals for territory to live and eat or for mates. On some levels, Clara understood that. She remembered seeing to male Mountain Lions practically kill each other over mating with her three years before she was uplifted. The cubs from that litter were grown now and Clara had no real idea where they or the two adult male Mountain Lions were now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong?&quot; a voice asked from behind her.<br />
<br />
Clara turned to see Robbie &quot;the fox.&quot; The fox kit she had found in the initial outbreak, double dosed, and enjoyed some casual sex with. In a strange way, she had really come to like him, even though the edicts they had agreed on would mean that they couldn&#39;t breed. Casual sex between mating seasons was okay, but not during the mating season.<br />
<br />
&quot;You looked a bit hesitant,&quot; Robbie said as he approached, &quot;Something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing is wrong,&quot; Clara answered, &quot;just pausing before going to see what the response was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think it was rather good,&quot; Robbie commented as he followed her into her office, &quot;just about everyone I talked to was rather pleasant and positive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clara sat down at her desk and turned on her computer. It had been specifically designed for her her and her more paw-like hands. Her fingers could work like her paws used to as well as like human fingers. It meant she wasn&#39;t as dexterous as a human, but then, she was also taller and more muscular than even a few human males, so all that balanced out in a way.<br />
<br />
&quot;With those that are close to us in Lyre, sure,&quot; Clara spoke, &quot;but remember what the lab people and government health and environmental protection people said... the conditions that helped us avoid real trouble when the outbreak started WASN&#39;T unanimous. In the long term, we may have a LOT of convincing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robbie slowly nodded and walked around Clara&#39;s desk as the uplifted Mountain Lion accessed the internet and was soon checking through various online news media. She did find a couple of articles that discussed the party, and based on the headlines they did look rather positive. One had some of the discussions and theories on how the Animalia Virus could actually become a cure for all sorts of diseases for animals and humans alike. Looking through it it, it seemed to be a rather positive article and covered just about everything, even with the scientists at the lab trying to work with the Animalia Virus to see if they could combine it with human DNA in a way that humans who didn&#39;t want to become Animalians but were looking at potential life threatening illness that only the Animalia Virus could for the moment cure, they would have that option.<br />
<br />
&quot;That all looks good,&quot; Robbie commented as he looked over Clara&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Just what you wanted to show...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Clara nodded and hit the back button to look through another article. This one was on some of the commentary on the nature of how Abby, Sarah, Jessica, and Sophie&#39;s friendship hadn&#39;t changed despite the physical changes that they had each gone through, even with Sophie remaining human, not to mention the commentary some of the cases where an Animalian had fallen in love with a human and realized it after being uplifted and soon becoming involved in a romantic relationship.<br />
<br />
The article was fairly well written and did praise the issues of love and friendship that sat the corps of Animalia&#39;s Ten Edicts, and that brought a smile to Clara&#39;s face. The language in the article was fairly clear that the writer of the online article was fairly supportive, particularly with regard to the coverage of the introduction of their panel to serve as &quot;ambassadors&quot; from Animalia and Lyre to the world. Clara found the line, &quot;friendship is more than one&#39;s looks&quot; particularly touching and that made her smile. However, the comment section under the article soon erased that smile, as the very first comment was very acidic in nature.<br />
<br />
The post read: They talk on friendship, but at the end of the day, all of this is nothing more than the weak-assed Liberturds that can&#39;t find and never did find anyone that could like them, let alone love them. It&#39;s thus no surprise that the ONLY &quot;person&quot; (and I use person loosely) that finds such a dumb, ugly, immoral, and overall crappy person worthy of their attention is a FUCKING ANIMAL! Damn Animalia and all the Libturds allied with it should be nuked.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few replies that made the point that some of the people who had become Animalians hadn&#39;t necessarily asked to be transformed and that they were accidentally infected with the virus and hadn&#39;t gone looking to become Animalians, but the same poster came back quickly to claim that the whole story of it being an accident being a complete lie or, &quot;if it was an accident, it was already an animal and thus MY point stands.&quot; Clara sighed heavily at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That looks bad...&quot; Robbie commented, &quot;but it doesn&#39;t look like his posts are well liked. Most of what they&#39;ve given his comments are thumbs down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s about all that&#39;s good,&quot; Clara sighed.<br />
<br />
Then another comment then came up, and it read: In response to ih8Ulibs, I cannot say how much your comment is a disgrace to people everywhere of EITHER Democratic or Republican persuasion. I live in Lyre and I&#39;ve been a life long Republican. While the Animalia Virus outbreak was a surprise and while I personally don&#39;t want to be one... the supposed crimes and immoral acts that have come about because of it is simply not true. I&#39;ve met a few of the girls that were on the panel before their transformations and they were all human. I will also tell you that they were of EXCELLENT moral standing. They weren&#39;t the type to be interested in the sort of things that you&#39;ve claimed. And even avoiding that issue, Animalia is not some morally degenerate society and have actually put together a society that so far has had no violent crime and no petty theft. About the only &quot;crime&quot; that has occurred in Animalia has been people driving too fast through the newly built town. Their edicts forbade predators hunting uplifted prey and forbade out right physical combat... outside of sports, I suppose, and so far they&#39;ve had none of those edicts broken in Animalia or in Lyre. You can hate all you wish, but you are wrong and a disgrace to all mankind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that looked good,&quot; Robbie commented, &quot;we have friends in Lyre that will be friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Clara commented, &quot;that is good... certainly helps when dealing with those who apparently hate everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robbie nodded.</p>
