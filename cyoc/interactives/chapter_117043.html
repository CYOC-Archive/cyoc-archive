<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trent spent some time just riding Shawn’s…no…HIS new motorcycle around. It was marvellous! Thanks to the knowledge he had gained while absorbing Shawn he knew exactly how to ride it like someone who had done this for years. He knew when to lean into a turn, how to stop, how to start, it had become second nature to him. <br />
<br />
And Trent had not just gained Shawn’s skill in biking, but Shawn’s passion for it was alive within him as well. Before merging his buddy into him, Trent had never cared for motorcycles, had never seen the appeal of it, now he did.  <br />
Slowly Trent turned his bike homewards and soon was in for a surprise as he suddenly stood in front of the place Shawn stayed with his father. Or rather used to stay. Trent chuckled and gave his stomach a pat. Somehow, as he had utilized Shawn’s knowledge of how to ride a motorcycle, coupled with his own wish to go home, those two things must have mixed and his subconsciousness must have taken him to Shawn’s home.  Well he supposed it was his home now as well, what with him now being partially made up of Shawn, but he doubted Shawn’s father would react well to learning that his son was now part of another man and had basically ceased to exist as an individual… <br />
Trent grimaced as he kicked off the bike again to go back to his own apartment. He had never considered the impact on Shawn’s life when he had forcefully merged his buddy into him. Shawn might not be missing uni right know, but he would be missing everything else. Most of Shawn’s friends were people out of town he had met at university, so they wouldn’t notice his disappearance too much, but several people would definitely wonder where Shawn had gone, first of all his father, who definitely would wonder why his son wasn’t coming home. As would Shawn’s girlfriend, Clara. <br />
Stopping his bike and taking his helmet off Trent considered this aspect for a while. Before absorbing Shawn he had been so desperate, and so horny, to merge with his friend that he had never considered the aftermath of such an action. He had consumed an entire person, a man who had possessed his own life, relationships, everything. <br />
<br />
The obvious solution was naturally to just separate Shawn from his being again, to restore his friend as the separate individual he had been before Trent had claimed him. He knew he had the power, he could feel it. All he had to do was will Shawn to be separated from himself. <br />
Trouble was Trent knew how pissed Shawn would be at him, he had taken Shawn by force and Trent, now possessing intimate knowledge of Shawn’s inner mind, could see no way their friendship could survive this. He supposed it had been a pretty rotten thing to do, to just suck up good old Shawn like that, but he hadn’t been thinking straight when he did that. <br />
The other trouble was…he did not want to let Shawn go. He enjoyed being the same man as Shawn. He started to rub his muscles. He enjoyed his new body, he enjoyed his enhanced mind and…yes.. in some part he enjoyed the act of denying Shawn his individual existence. He knew he would never want to restore Shawn, not really. On some level this scared Trent, on another it made him horny. Incredibly horny. Trent started to rub his leather boner against the motorcycle’s seat and moaned. God he was enjoying this…why couldn’t Shawn have been more enthusiastic about merging with him?   <br />
He wondered…absorbing Shawn had already felt incredibly good…but would it have felt even better if Shawn had been into it? Instead of fighting there could have been harmony…sex even… Merging with someone while having sex with them…now that was a thought… <br />
<br />
Trent smiled, yes he wanted that. He wanted to absorb someone who would be willing to become part of him, while fucking them. He smiled at the ring on his gloved finger, now it was just a matter of finding someone. <br />
 <br />
                 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It was a few hours later, about Nightfall, when Trent walked into a local gay hangout spot. He was still wearing the leather business suit that had been created from his old suit and Shawn’s motorcycle leathers, for a reason he himself could not quite explain he even left his gloves on…since absorbing Shawn he liked wearing them…did Shawn have some subconscious fetish for them that had now become part of him? It seemed like it…As Trent flexed his hands inside their leather prisons he recalled some of Shawn’s memories of being…fascinated… by women wearing leather gloves in winter. Trent smiled, he had just learned something new about his old buddy Shawn. <br />
<br />
As usual when looking for someone Trent first went to the bar and ordered a drink. Starting to sip he looked around to get an idea of the men that were available. It was a weeknight so the selection wasn’t large, beyond that…what exactly was Trent looking for? Someone to merge into himself…who would be willing to be used that way. How was he supposed to find someone like that? He wasn’t looking for a one-night stand; he wasn’t looking for a relationship, he was looking to integrate someone else into his very being…possibly permanently. Trent twisted his mouth, he could hardly go up to people and ask them whether they wanted to become part of him. <br />
Taking another deep sip from his drink Trent shook his head, what was he thinking? Nobody would volunteer to become one with him. Nobody was just going to allow him to… <br />
<br />
 Trent’s train of thought derailed as he, by accident, locked eyes with a guy across the room. He was handsome as all hell; he was shorter than Trent by a few inches, but more muscular (even with the addition of Shawn) with a ginger beard and thick, copper coloured hair. He was wearing a black tank top that displayed his muscular, and hairy arms and tight, black jeans. The guy smiled at him and winked. It was a hot smile; easy, kinda roguish. Trent knew right then, right there that he was going to absorb that man… He felt his dick harden, his blood quickening, his heart racing. He returned the smile. <br />
<br />
What happened next was even better; the guy walked up to him! “Hey there,” the guy said with another roguish smile as he let his eyes trail over Trent, “nice getup…” <br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Trent replied and stretched out his leather gloved hand “I’m Trent.” <br />
<br />
The guy not just shook Trent’s hand, but took hold of it and drew it up to his mouth. After taking a good, deep whiff of the leather he gave Trent another wink and licked right across the glove’s palm before letting go of it. “I’m Ryan.” <br />
<br />
Trent’s dick was now completely erect, and painfully supressed under his tight leather pants. <br />
<br />
Ryan sat down next to Trent and ordered himself a drink, “I’m really into leather…” he explained “especially if it’s worn by a hot guy like yourself...you’re into it as well?” he chuckled “Dumb question, with a getup like that you’re bound to be…” <br />
<br />
It took a while for Trent to find his speech again “Actually I just got into it recently…” he returned to his drink and took another sip, “very recently.”<br />
<br />
“Well, lucky me then…” Ryan marked “…so your place or mine?” <br />
<br />
Damn that was quick…then again, Trent supposed absorbing Shawn had improved his looks quite a bit. He tried to keep himself from grinning as he glanced over at Ryan; this hot guy that wanted to be close to him…that he would be able to merge with. <br />
Trent’s grin disappeared…only that he had no means of knowing whether Ryan would want to merge with him…for all he knew it would turn out like Trent. And there was no way to find out beforehand…well except the obvious. <br />
“Actually,” Trent began and took a deep breath “I am not quite sure that we are looking for the same thing…” <br />
<br />
Ryan raised an eyebrow “Whatcha looking for?” <br />
<br />
Trent gulped, took another swallowed the rest of his drink and then looked Ryan right in the eyes “I’m looking for someone to become part of me…” <br />
<br />
Trent had not been sure what kind of reaction he had expected, feared or hoped for from Ryan, what he got, however was something completely different. Ryan did not respond immediately, instead the guy just sat there for a bit. Something in his body language changed, the roughish smiles and playful winks were gone. Yet there was…something…in Ryan’s gorgeous green eyes and a tent in his jeans. <br />
Now it was Ryan’s turn to take a deep sip from his drink, “Whatever do you mean by that?” <br />
<br />
Trent bit his lip “What do you think I mean?” <br />
<br />
“Well I…” Ryan started, then shook his head “Nah, that’s nonsense…” <br />
<br />
“Go on?” <br />
<br />
Ryan glanced at him “You’re not a cannibal, are ya?” <br />
<br />
Trent shook his head “No.” <br />
<br />
The tent in Ryan’s pants grew larger “Well then… there’s well…I have seen stuff on the internet. Stories, pictures, a few comics, where one guy sucks up another into his body, right through the skin…and uses them to bulk himself up…” <br />
<br />
Trent felt hope rising up inside his chest, “And you find that hot?” <br />
<br />
“Fucking hot,” he looked at Trent, “I know it sounds weird, but I’d love for someone to do that to me…to suck me into their body and make me their muscles… to become part of them…to be completely dominated like that.” Then the roughish smile returned, more forced then before “But that’s just fantasy, so what did you actually mean?” <br />
<br />
Now it was Trent’s turn to smile “What if I told you that what you described is exactly what I meant? That I came here tonight with the intention to find a guy I could suck into my body, use all they are to improve myself and completely dominate them?”<br />
He leaned closer to Ryan “What if I told you that I really have that power? That just a few hours ago I have already done that to another man, my best friend, who is part of me as we speak? What if I told you I wanted to do it to you as well?”<br />
<br />
Ryan’s skin was now radiating heat, he was clearly hornier than a jackrabbit. “You’re fucking good at roleplaying…” <br />
<br />
Trent grasped Ryan’s hand “I ain’t roleplaying Ryan, I do have the power to mix other men into me…I have used it to absorb my best friend earlier today, and I want to make you part of me…but only if you want me to…” he whispered into Ryan’s ear <br />
“Do you want to become part of me, Ryan?” <br />
<br />
Ryan was clearly overwhelmed by the situation, sweating, staring straight ahead, but finally he was able to answer “Yes!” <br />
<br />
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Trent and Ryan had made it back to Trent’s apartment in record time. Now they were already in Trent’s backroom, both stark naked, except for Trent’s gloves (Ryan had asked him to keep them on), and of course the ring that still shone silver and bright above the black leather.  <br />
<br />
Trent laid down on the bed, displaying his muscular, Shawn-enhanced body and huge dick to Ryan, and in turn took in every detail of Ryan’s own, hot, fit physiology. The other man was coated neck to toe in a fine dusting of copper red body hair, his cock was uncircumcised, there was a cute mole right beside his belly button.  Trent wanted to drink in every detail of Ryan’s body, every detail of this man that would soon be part of him, realizing that he might very well be the last person to lay eyes on this sexy man.<br />
 “You’re still absolutely sure that you want to become part of me?” he asked. He didn’t want to force Ryan, like he had forced Shawn. <br />
<br />
Ryan nodded, and his cock full erect stood in front of the bed “So how do we do this? How do I get under your skin?” <br />
<br />
“Prolonged physical contact is all that’s needed,” he explained, “but I want to make your absorption special. The other guy, Shawn, he didn’t want to be fused into me, so I had to fight him every inch along the way. With you I want to enjoy the process, I want to make love to until there is nothing of you left.” <br />
<br />
Ryan smiled “I like the sound of that..” <br />
<br />
“Well then…” Trent gestured for Ryan to join him in bed. The other man eagerly did you and for a while they just cuddled and enjoyed each other’s bodies. Trent was determined to give Ryan everything he wanted in his last moments as a separate person, so he let Ryan lick and suck on his leather covered fingers, caressed him all over, played with his dick…<br />
It came to a point where Ryan was licking and playfully nibbling at Trent’s nipples. When Ryan asked a question. <br />
<br />
“What will it be like for me?” he asked “Becoming part of you? What will it feel like for me? I can imagine the physical part,, but what about the mental one? I can’t quite wrap my mind around the idea that soon you and I will have the same mind, consciousness…soul…” <br />
<br />
Trent smiled “You’re not afraid are you?” <br />
<br />
Ryan shook his head “Just curious…” <br />
<br />
“To you it will feel like you are being transformed into me. Like all you are is stripped from you and overwritten with me. <br />
My emotions, my thoughts, my desires. And eventually you’ll be me.” <br />
<br />
“Once I’m inside of you, will I ever come out again? Is that even possible?” <br />
<br />
“I can separate you from my body whenever I choose,” Trent explained and then smiled “but I will be honest with you; I can see no way I’m ever letting you go again. Once you go under my skin, you ain’t coming back…” He kissed Ryan’s cheek “You still wanna do this?” <br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah…” Ryan answered and smirked “truth be told I was hoping you’d keep me forever…” He snickered “It’s nuts, isn’t it? You just told me you were going to trap me inside your body for the rest of my life…and I’m feeling aroused, elated….I should be scared… But truth be told…I always wanted this… I don’t want to live for myself, I can’t…I want to become an asset for somebody else, part of someone…” <br />
<br />
“I’m glad that it’s like that,” Trent told Ryan “and I’m glad that you still want to be merged into me, because otherwise I would have had to force you like Shawn…” <br />
<br />
Ryan’s mouth hung open “You mean you would have forced me if I had said no?” <br />
<br />
“You think I’ll allow you to get into bed naked with me, make me all horny for some absorption and then let you go again?” Trent grinned “You sealed your fate the moment you spoke to me in the club…” <br />
<br />
Ryan wanted to reply something but Trent held his mouth closed “We’re starting now…”<br />
<br />
Trent guided Ryan into lying on top of him, his arms now wrapped tightly around the hot redhead. Ryan seemed to be an experienced bottom, he showed no discomfort when Trent entered his juicy ass and started thrusting. He also let one of his gloved hands wander down to Ryan’s dick to play with it and masturbate the other man. The other man that would soon not be so “other’ anymore… <br />
<br />
Trent was awed by how different this was to when he had merged with Shawn. Back there, on the motorcycle everything had been power, and force and a desperate struggle. Here, with Ryan? Harmony, tenderness…yes, even love… He was enjoying this… He was so lucky that Ryan gave himself willingly, and so grateful… <br />
After a few minutes of simply making love to Ryan, Trent finally concentrated on the ring on his gloved finger – and activated its powers. <br />
<br />
The next time Trent thrusted into Ryan, there was a wet sound (akin to a large stone being dropped into a mud puddle) and their bodies started blending into each other.  The barrier of their skins broke down wherever they touched, as if the surface tension of a bubble broke and liquefying flesh blended together like warm clay. Trent could even feel his dick connecting and melding with Ryan’s hole. Both their anal and genital areas merged together into a sort of hotbed for pure, sexual pleasure as nerves connected between their bodies. Trent could now feel Ryan’s hole and dick as his own, so he got the experience of simultaneously fucking someone, being fucked and being masturbated, all at once.  Combined with the pleasure that was caused by the fusion itself, the amount of sexual exhilaration was unbelievable. If absorbing Shawn had felt like being at the centre of a white-hot star, this felt like a whole supernova. <br />
<br />
“It’s happening…” Ryan managed to say between moaning “I’m…I’m sinking into you…I’m becoming part of you…” <br />
<br />
That was the truth; Ryan’s body was rapidly swallowed up by Trent’s. His legs and feet had already slipped into Trent’s, still visibly moving inside the taller, but lankier man’s frame, stretching it out to larger proportions. Ryan’s hands and arms had disappeared into Trent’s torso. Finally Trent’s dick, moving all through Ryan’s mass, emerged from their fused pelvis, right over Ryan’s, swallowing it up and growing larger and fatter in the process. Their first shared load was blown right after that, long, sticky strings of white cum. <br />
<br />
So it finally came to a point where all that was left of Ryan was his face, now sticking out of the crevice between Trent’s pecs. Trent looked down to where Ryan’s face peeked up at him, the other man opened his mouth to say something, but Trent out one of his leather covered on Ryan’s lips, shushing him. Then he gave Ryan a roguish smirk (something he had already absorbed from him), a wink and then bounced his pecs, submerging Ryan’s face into his body. <br />
<br />
Now Trent’s body lost cohesion, his form melting into a sort of vaguely-human shaped blob of goo, just like it had happened when merging with Shawn and the mental part of the fusion commenced. <br />
<br />
Absorbing Shawn’s soul had felt like swallowing a storm, absorbing Ryan felt like an ocean might feel, if it was capable of sensation, as a river pours itself into it. Every memory, every experience, every love, hate, dream, fear that Ryan supplied to Trent’s being made him richer, stronger, better, until there was nothing left of Ryan to give and the two men had become one in body, mind and soul. <br />
<br />
The new and improved Trent gasped for air as his body re-solidified. Like with Shawn, his first instinct was to find a mirror, so he leaped up from the bed and ran for the bathroom. <br />
<br />
What awaited him there was even better than what he saw after merging with Shawn; it seemed almost like all of Ryan had been converted into pure, rock hard muscle.  He now had mighty pecs, chiselled abs, thick, muscular arms and – god his hands! They were huge now! Huge, and meaty and still tightly encased in a pair of skin tight leather gloves – and Ryan’s leather fetish was very alive within him! <br />
<br />
He started to lick and suck his own, leather gloved fingers, while starting to play with his dick with the other hand. His dick had grown by several inches, and, thanks to Ryan had regrown its foreskin, making it even more sensitive. <br />
Trent’s face finally now combined all the best features of himself, Shawn and Ryan with a thick, neatly trimmed, auburn beard and matching, wavy hair.   <br />
<br />
Trent took a moment to think about what was happening; he had swallowed up two men by now and each of them had supplied all their best parts to improve him more and more, to make him hotter, smarter, stronger, better. <br />
He tenderly touched the spot on his chest where Ryan’s face had disappeared into his body “Thanks, pal…” then he looked at the Merging Ring on his finger again “And thanks to you, as well…” <br />
<br />
Then he gave his reflection one of Ryan’s trademark roguish smiles and winks before going back to bed where he continued to pleasure himself through the night.</p>
