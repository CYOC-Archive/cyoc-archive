<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Being an actress is hard. Jennifer Mitchell learned that lesson quickly as she maneuvered her way through Hollywood.<br />
<br />
The 60 year old blonde had been acting since she was 8 when she landed her first commercial. At the time the sky was the limit, Jennifer was the All American girl, golden blonde hair, sky blue eyes, and an adorable face made her a hot commodity. As Jennifer entered her teens, more rolls opened for her.<br />
<br />
Jennifer had a classic girl next door look to her. By 14 she landed on a sitcom, playing the beat friend of the lead actors daughter.  Jennifer would joke later on that she was Kimmy Gibbler before Kimmy Gibbler. When the show ended after 4 seasons Jennifer looked to broaden her horizons.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer entered her 20s she found herself in but parts once again, her looks winning her parts more than her abilities. Cult classics, horror flicks, and bit parts in comedies became her staple. Jennifer didn&#39;t complain about being pidgeon holed, she was making plenty of money on living quite well on her residuals. Then the worst thing in the world happened. She turned 30.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Jennifer was too old for the movies that had made her rich. Fewer and fewer jobs came her way. Jennifer was forced into commercials and even having to learn to be a better actress. The blonde womans 30s were miserable but as she hit 40 she had a renewed confidence in her abilities.<br />
<br />
This was when Jennifer was smacked in the face by reality. A 40 year old woman (even an attractive one) had limited options. Jennifer would be the mom in tv movies and sitcoms. Never a starting actress even if she was a better actress than most of her coworkers. Jennifer kept at it, doing voice work and continuing to perfect her craft. That is until this latest injustice.<br />
<br />
Jennifer had recently turned 60 when her agent presented her with a part she would be perfect for. While she liked the part she gasped in horror at what it was for. She would be playing a grandmother.<br />
<br />
This was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. She wasnt some grandma. This was when Jennifer did some research and discovered Regenesis. Sure the treatment would cost her 80 million dollars but she saw it as more of an investment. Besides, after the passing of her producer husband, she would still have 400 million dollars to her name.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how does this work,&quot; Jennifer asked as she sat in a doctor&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its quite simple really,&quot; a young doctor stated. &quot;A quantum transference rejuvenates your cells as they accelerate the donor&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;English please son,&quot; Jennifer sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You get younger the donor gets older.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And who exactly is the donor,&quot; Jennifer asked, a feeling of guilt washing over her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing to worry about Ms. Mitchell,&quot; the doctor stated. &quot;Our donor is a 40 year old Jane Doe. They&#39;ve been in a coma for the past 7 years with no family ever stepping forward. Trust me they wont be missed. Now please, change into your robe and meet us in the transfer room.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the doctor exited the room Jennifer quickly disrobed, taking a look at her aged body. Jennifer&#39;s CC cup breasts certainly looked elderly, having lost all firmness and hanging on her like a pair of sock. Glancing at the rest of her body only made Jennifer realize how old she was.<br />
<br />
The 60 year old womans body appeared to have no muscle tone, with slight wrinkles around her eyes and a slight paunch. Looking at her legs she could see just how thin they now looked. Even Jennifer&#39;s hands and feet seemed skinnier. The final insult was of course the noticable grey hairs in her neatly trimmed pubic hair. &quot;Goodbye old me hello young me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drawing the robe around herself, Jennifer now made the way down the hall. As she opened the door to the treatment room she could see an unconscious woman laying on a table, next to another empty table. The doctor now beckoned Jennifer to lay down, which she did drawing the robe around her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll feel a warm sensation over your body during the procedure.&quot; Jennifer simply nodded as the machine whirred to light bathing her in a faint light.<br />
<br />
The sensation was pleasant, if a bit odd. Despite the donor being 40, she had been told that she wouldnt end up that old. If the procedure worked, Jennifer would be a fresh faced 20 year old once more. At first she wasnt sure if things were working. Glancing down at her hands and chest, she immediately gasped.<br />
<br />
The weathered and worn hands of the 60 year old woman appeared smoother, more youthful with each passing moment. Jennifer&#39;s skeletal hands were firming up once more, liver spots vanishing as her skin tone evened and brightened.<br />
<br />
While happy with her hands, the womans breasts appeared to be firming. When Jennifer had been laying down her breats were almost flat against her body. As she youthened she could see them firming, pushing her robe farther and farther. As the light dissipated Jennifer could see two firm mounds, blocking her view.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did it work,&quot; she asked breathlessly. &quot;Am I young?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaping to her feet Jennifer looked herself over. The robe appeared more form fitting now, hugging her curvy waist and accentuating her firm rear. As she studied her legs she was impressed not onlybwoth how toned her legs were but how smooth her feet appeared. As she now looked in a mirror the girl gasped.<br />
<br />
The aged face of the 60byear old actress was gone. Jennifer was now a very pretty blonde girl, her face more round than before with flawless skin and bright eyes. Running a hand through her golden blonde locks Jennifer  was amazed to find her hair seemed to shimmer with life, being fuller than she had seen it in years. Best of all, Jennifer&#39;s hair had gone from grey and dull.to the brilliant golden blonde of her youth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations Ms. Mitchell,&quot; the doctor smiled. &quot;You&#39;re now 20 years old. What do you plan on doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer smirked, it was time to become the actress she always wanted.</p>
