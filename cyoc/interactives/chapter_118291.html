<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For a while, I didn&#39;t care about anything except playing in the fountain.   The scent of chlorinated water,  the sound of gushing water, and the sight of gleaming good-luck pennies beneath the water surface was more than enough to occupy my toddler senses.<br />
<br />
But something seemed...off.  It had been a very long time ago, but I could&#39;ve sworn that my mom hadn&#39;t let me get away with this.  From what I remember, I had barely climbed into the fountain before she snatched me up and forced me back into my clothes.  Needless to say, we&#39;d gone home early.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, where was she?  Was I just not remembering things right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, you&#39;re remembering it right,&quot; said a familiar voice on the brim of the fountain.  The fairy had poofed back into existence, apparently deeply involved in the process of filing his nails.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s it different?&quot; I asked, taken aback by how small and emasculated my voice was.  <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t bother to look up.  &quot;Well, it&#39;d be kinda disappointing if we followed the memory -exactly-.  It lasted less than a minute, after all.  So I&#39;ve turned this into a &#39;sandbox&#39; of sorts.  You&#39;re free to live every toddler&#39;s dream: run around with no supervision or consequences.  No one will ask where your parents are, or bring you to security.   Be as reckless as you want.  People might laugh a little, but not much else.  By the way, there&#39;s a towel over by that bench for when you want to dry off.&quot;<br />
<br />
I grinned.  &quot;You&#39;re actually kinda cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrugged and blew the dust off his nail.  &quot;Just fulfilling my end of the bargain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute.  If Mom&#39;s not around, who&#39;s gonna take care of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The fairy got to work on his other hand.  &quot;She&#39;s around all right, just not here.  She&#39;ll be at the Banana Republic when you&#39;re ready to find her...y&#39;know, I never really understood those stores.  Anyway, she&#39;ll have some powder and a fresh diaper ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
I blush as I imagined her lifting my legs high into the air and powdering me right on the mall&#39;s cold, tiled floor.  I still wasn&#39;t sure if this wish would be a dream come true or a nightmare.<br />
<br />
The fairy poofed out of existence before I could say thanks.  <br />
<br />
I went back to playing in the fountain.  It wasn&#39;t particularly large, but my tiny form made it seem like a waterpark.  There weren&#39;t a lot of people around, and the few who saw me didn&#39;t pay much attention.  I think some people might&#39;ve giggled a bit, but it was hard to hear over the rushing water.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, I was starting to have a waterworks problem of my own.  A small but insistent pressure was building in my tiny bladder.  At first I could ignore it, but after a few more minutes I was starting to instinctively do the potty dance.  I looked to the bathrooms, and they seemed miles away.  Would I even reach the toilets?  But then I remembered: I was thinking of this like an adult.<br />
<br />
I breathed out and let my toddler mind take over.  My back stiffened, and I widened my stance a little.  After a small struggle, I let it go.  I just peed into the fountain like that famous statue.  Just like my toddler self.  <br />
<br />
A grandma with her two grandkids chuckled at the crazy little streaker in the fountain who&#39;d clearly lost his diaper.  I was partly mortified by this, and partly gratified.  On one hand I just wanted to be a little kid, but on the other I still had scraps of my adult inhibitions.  I felt my hands move to shield my groin as a blush rose on my cheeks.  As I got out of the fountain, I tried to cover my rear, too.  I couldn&#39;t wait to get dressed.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, on the bench there was a small fluffy towel, a juicebox, a cookie, and a brand-new pair of red velcro sneakers and white socks.  Just that?  Puzzled, I looked over to where I&#39;d originally left my clothes.  No sign of them.  <br />
<br />
There was a note next to the towel: it read, &quot;Since you specifically wanted to go back to the infamous Day of the Mall Streaker, I assume you won&#39;t want your clothes back for a while.  They were getting kinda ratty anyway, so you&#39;re welcome. And just like a professional streaker, I left you with these shoes so you can run as fast you want without slipping.  Just don&#39;t play with the elevator buttons, okay?   No one will care, but it&#39;s kind of a dick move.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and did my best to towel off.  Not having any body hair made the process a lot faster.  I wrapped the towel around my waist and enjoyed the Hi-C and the chocolate chip cookie.  The sugar rush flowed through me like magma in a volcano, and I was antsy to get going again.  I awkwardly pulled my socks and shoes on and continued my journey through the mall, the towel still preserving my lingering modesty.<br />
<br />
It felt like one of those anxiety dreams where you wander around in a public area and realize you forgot your clothes.  But in this case, I wasn&#39;t completely distressed.  I alternated between adult shame and toddler shamelessness as I wandered towards the escalators, sometimes clutching the towel tightly and other times wondering why I didn&#39;t just drop it and run free.  I stepped onto the escalator, careful to not let the towel get caught between the cracks.  As I stepped off at the top, I sighed in relief.  Escalators had always scared me--especially at the age of three. <br />
<br />
I was starting to regret this whole decision, so I began to make my way to where my Mom was allegedly waiting.  I was making good progress, too, until a mall worker came by pushing a cart.  A protruding knob on the cart got caught around my towel, and by the time I realized what was happening I was spinning in place as the cart unwrapped my towel.  The worker just went on, oblivious and listening to music on his Walkman.  He was in a rush, so my toddler legs couldn&#39;t keep up, and his music was blocking out my calls for him to stop.  In the end, he disappeared into a maintenance room and the door locked shut behind him.<br />
<br />
Worse still: the towel had rubbed my groin as it was whipped off.  My penis stiffened immediately.  <br />
<br />
I was naked, and my last covering was permanently gone.  I was left with only socks, shoes, and a tiny erection.<br />
<br />
Sniffling, I looked at a mirrored storefront.  I could truly appreciate how much I&#39;d changed.  Every last trace of my adulthood had been sucked away.  My wide eyes stared back at me, almost obscured by the shaggy mop of black hair.  I could&#39;ve passed for a little girl if it weren&#39;t for the nub poking out from between my legs.  <br />
<br />
All around me, people thought this was a hilarious scene.  A little girl scarcely older than me pointed at my penis and laughed.   I thought the red-hot blush in my cheeks would set my hair on fire.<br />
<br />
I covered up, but it was too late.  They&#39;d already seen everything, and they watched with amusement as I played my role as the streaker and ran off at top speed, my sneakers clacking rhythmically against the hard floor.  I didn&#39;t even have time to switch my hand and cover my little bottom.<br />
<br />
It seemed like I was doomed to humiliation and misery until I found my Mom, but then I started to slow my pace.  People were laughing, yes, but it wasn&#39;t malicious.  After all, I was just a little toddler who didn&#39;t know any better.   No one was trying to make me feel bad.  <br />
<br />
Once again, I breathed out and let my younger self take over.<br />
<br />
My hands started to drift away from my groin.  It felt nice to feel the air flowing across my skin without scratchy, stuffy clothes.  I ran inside a FuncoLand--geez, it&#39;d been ages since I&#39;d heard that name--and raced down the aisles, enjoying the classic games blaring on the TV screens.  A mom said I had a cute bottom, and her first-grader son called me &quot;Wienerman,&quot; but I wasn&#39;t too embarrassed.  <br />
<br />
Curious, I examined one of the lower shelves.  The nostalgia hit me like a physical wave; it was so surreal to see all these old titles lined up and advertised as new.  The clerk eyed me cautiously, probably afraid I would break something.<br />
<br />
Suddenly...</p>
