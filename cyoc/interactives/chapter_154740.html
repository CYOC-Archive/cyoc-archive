<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Wish I went further in depth on James&#39;s thicker thighs and a bigger and more womanly ass! The body would have to get bigger in that area just to accommodate a horse vagina. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">  &quot;What now?&quot;, As James was still in pure ecstacy from his first experience as a woman; Joan was sitting on a tree stump near James pondering her future. &quot;Im a 39 year old woman and I still don&#39;t know what I want to do with my life&quot;, Much of the later years of Joan&#39;s life was spent on questioning her life decisions that lead up to this point.<br />
<br />
 Joan had her revenge, she knew they fucked, she also knew what she did was wrong. Henry was a man that she should of moved on from years ago, but Jess didn&#39;t deserve any of this.   &quot;But is it too late for me? What I&#39;ve done...... Is there any going back for me?&quot;, Joan was lost in thought and it would be so easy........... If she stayed in this clearing long enough she was sure a goat would come out and fuck her. Looking at James gave her a idea &quot;What if I ask James what I should do? James was the only one who was honest and spoke his mind...... He can be my Justice System&quot;. Of course she had to keep the Melissa incident a secret before asking him otherwise he would think of her favorably!<br />
<br />
  Getting up off the tree trunk, Joan walked towards James and was going to ask him some questions.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Sweetie did you like the fuck? Now you know how a woman feels...&quot;, Joan said this with a pure heart and no ill attentions what so ever.<br />
<br />
 James was still groggy and had been groping and touching his body that had many new changes for him. Later on in the cabin he would want to fully examine his body and especially his smooth and almost feminine skin, but for now he realized it was probably best to get back. Looking up to his mom and seeing her body made him feel warm inside. She was gorgeous, Joans breasts and especially that nice cock of hers.......<br />
<br />
 &quot;Mom It was Amazing!! Getting penetrated was like nothing I could ever tell you in words..... Only in action&#128149;&quot;, James let that last word hang and didn&#39;t even realize she &quot;NO HE!&quot; was flirting with HIS mom.<br />
<br />
 Avoiding the obvious sexual tension Joan was frank and honest with James.   &quot;Snap out of it james!,    &quot; I want your opinion on what I should do next&quot;, Her mother scolding had snapped James out of the lusty fog and brought him truly back into the conversation.<br />
<br />
 &quot;You know what I&#39;ve done..... Scheming behind your back, I pretty much forced you against your will and sucked your dick.... Giving you hooves. Even though right now you probably don&#39;t care; Back then you did and I&#39;m sorry..&quot;, Joan was spilling the proverbial beans and kept going.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Right now I&#39;m not sure I can go back, Your father and sister probably hate me and rightfully so. I could live out here like you mentioned earlier James; I could find a goat and fuck myself into oblivion and truly become the goat I was meant to be..&quot;, In saying this Joan 30 minutes ago would not have had the feelings or the Willpower to even ask James a question like this. Seeing that Melissa had burned something deep within her like a spark that leads to a forest fire. She trusted her fate to James and whatever he chose would be her life purpose, The very thing she has spent most of her life trying to figure out herself.<br />
<br />
  Of course he knew of her scheming all along. He used to shudder at the things she was doing in that painting room of hers. Jess also had told him to beware Joan and be carefull of her. Obviously he already learned that when she sucked his dick and that made him lose his human feet and traded them for these hooves he has now.  &quot;But does that one mistake mean such a massive punishment?&quot;, She was dealing with the cabins lust like everyone else. Joan had done wrong though and like most things in life James wanted to find a happy medium.<br />
<br />
  &quot;That&#39;s silly mom, come with me back to the cabin and we will figure everything out.... Give it time!&quot;, James said this in a soft and almost feminine tone, but James kept going.<br />
<br />
  &quot;But if you keep on scheming and trying to make us all transform; I never want to see you again&quot;, This time his tone was obviously stern and direct. It wasn&#39;t like his actual voice had changed, but it came off as a Mom telling her children that strangers were bad or something like that. <br />
<br />
 Joan didn&#39;t find happiness or sadness from James&#39;s decision, She knew that from here on out things were going to be challenging at the cabin. The goats option was actually the fun and easy pick for her, but she had a part of her that wanted to cling on to her humanity and never let that go. As Joan and James were about to leave the clearing; Joan remembered the secret that she kept from James.<br />
<br />
 &quot;James one last thing&quot;, Joan said this quickly and efficiently.     &quot;Ya mom?&quot;, James said with a curious face.<br />
<br />
 On their way back Joan told him about everything, how she kept her away from James in his private moment with Dakota, How she had heroically scared Melissa away; Bringing this up had made Joan laugh, but James felt ill from what he was hearing. James didn&#39;t even know how to respond, everytime he thought of Melissa she &quot;NO HE!&quot; could only think of Dakota. Of course the one thing Joan did keep away from James was the fact that Melissa had already said an animals name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bitch.....&#129315;&quot;, Joan was still internally laughing at what that bratty girl had said.<br />
<br />
 The two could see the cabin lights from the thinning treeline. Stepping out of the trees and into the open clearing, it wasn&#39;t dark out yet, but it seemed colder out... Like the weather was changing seasons. The both were actually getting cold and with James losing all of his body hair; This left him colder than Joan! They both noticed something strange at the halfway point of reaching the cabin doors.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Mom what the hell is that&quot;, Said James, Leaning on Joan like a girl at the movies.<br />
<br />
 &quot;It&#39;s a building?&quot;,  Nothing surprised them both anymore, If Melissa could come to this same place as them than anything is possible.<br />
<br />
 Both quickly went to see what was going on with this building. Entering the building both knew what it was instantly and Joan laughing had James follow suit. <br />
<br />
 &quot;It&#39;s a barn with two stalls...... For cows!&quot;,  Joan was laughing so much she almost made herself and James fall down together. It was total madness, but the both could still feel the humor of it all.       &quot;Maybe Henry made this today... At least assembly wasn&#39;t required&quot;, The both were just balling and laughing together. Both wondered if they had ever laughed this much in their lives.... As the laughing died down it got quiet and the fun was over.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Hey look a coat rack&quot;, James pointed right next to them and there was a few fur coats on the rack. James and Joan had erect nipples for the last 10 minutes and a coat was much obliged. Mother and daughter &quot;No Son!&quot; Both grabbed coats to wear which would keep them warm and concealed their bodies. James needed this bad to hide his changes from Melissa. Joan grabbed her coat and it was the furrier of the two, but she looked at the label and it said.      &quot;Made from 100% goat fur&quot;.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Fuck you Cabin&quot;, Joan did not find this joke funny.<br />
<br />
 Wearing coats, they both left the barn and walked up to the door and could hear some commotion inside the cabin walls.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Are you ready James?&quot;.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Yes&quot;, James was nervous, but the two opened the door anyway and walked back into the Cabin in the Woods!</p>
