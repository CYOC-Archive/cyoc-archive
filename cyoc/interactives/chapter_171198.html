<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly you got movement back in your whole arm. Monica just sat on the bed beside you not saying anything. You were able to lift your arm and bought it around to the front of your face so you no longer needed the mirror. It was true. You had Monica&#39;s hands and arms. Your fingers were now dainty. You even had her long fingernails, although unlike Monica&#39;s they were not colored.<br />
<br />
With that hand you now felt the rest of your body. You were just a hard shell. You couldn&#39;t move your neck so you used your hand to point at the mirror. Monica passed it to you. Holding it in your left hand you examined your purple shell. You looked like some sort of alien. The purple had faded slightly but your shell was now mottled, you certainly did not appear to be human. The feminine arm looked at odds with the rest of your body.<br />
<br />
You spent the next day slowly picking off bits of your shell as cracks developed. Slowly your body was revealed - Monica&#39;s body. When you could finally speak after breaking off the shell over your mouth it was Monica&#39;s voice that came out of your throat. You didn&#39;t just have Monica&#39;s eyes you had her face and long light brown hair, although it was in a messy tangle.<br />
<br />
Breaking the shell off your chest revealed your new breasts, complete with pink nipples. You couldn&#39;t help but feel them with your left hand. Breasts certainly felt different when they were your own.<br />
<br />
By the time the shell around your groin started to crack you knew what to expect. Still the absence of your penis and balls hit hard. You now only had a small landing strip of light brown pubic hair covering a vagina. <br />
<br />
Monica helped you pick off the shell over your left leg. The shell dried in the same order that the swelling had spread across your body. Because your right side was still healing you couldn&#39;t bend to reach past your waist and reveal your own leg. Sure enough it was a copy of Monica&#39;s leg that was revealed. You realized you must have lost 5 inches of height. <br />
<br />
At least once you mouth was free you could eat once more. Monica fixed you a meal. She rightly guessed that you now shared her taste buds. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until the next morning that the last of the shell came off. Finally you had emerged from your chrysalis. You could now get out of the bed and walk around. The first thing you did was to have a shower. Your twin helped you wash your hair and removed the greasy residue that your skin was coated with. It felt amazing to be free of the shell and having a shower with an equally naked Monica, though you were a bit concerned that her body was no longer turning you on. It just felt wrong.<br />
<br />
You let Monica dry you and dress you in some of her clothes. Of course they fit you perfectly. She showed you how to put on a bra and helped you dry and style your hair.<br />
<br />
Only once you were dressed did Monica start to teach you how to shapeshift. &#39;Okay so who do you want to try and turn into?&#39; she asked<br />
<br />
&#39;Myself of course&#39; you replied. &#39;What do I have to do?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well Of course I have never had formal lessons myself. I just think of the person I want to change into and remember when we touched. Remember what their skin felt like. Then let that feeling take over your body&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;What do you mean by remember what their skin felt like? All skin feels the same&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No it doesn&#39;t. Everyone&#39;s skin feels very different&#39; she looked puzzled &#39;At least to me it does&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well I don&#39;t remember what my skin felt like. It always just felt like me&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well just try and remember that feeling and replicate it&#39;<br />
<br />
Simon tried to remember touching himself in his old male body, however it felt exactly the same as it felt to touch her current female body. Subsequently nothing happened.<br />
<br />
&#39;I have an idea&#39; said Monica &#39;I&#39;ll become you. Then you touch my skin and you will then know what you feel like&#39;<br />
<br />
Simon then watched as Monica changed herself into a naked copy of her old male body. She was astounded at how tall and handsome she was. When she had been Simon she had not realized how good looking she was. And that penis! Had it always been so big?<br />
<br />
&#39;Well don&#39;t stand there gawking darling. Touch me. Feel my skin&#39; He had a beautiful deep voice.<br />
<br />
Simon was stunned out of her trance &#39;Anywhere?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes anywhere. You just need skin to skin contact&#39;<br />
<br />
Simon reached out and touched Monica on the shoulder. Instantly she was assaulted by new feelings. She new this person - well of course she knew this person - it was herself. <br />
<br />
Monica was talking. &#39;Try and remember how that feels. Now take you hand away then try and re-live that feeling. Remember what I felt like&#39;<br />
<br />
All Simon could think of was what a sexy voice Monica now had. She was feeling moist in her groin. She was staring at Monica&#39;s midriff and the huge member. Was it starting to swell?<br />
<br />
&#39;Simon. I can see this isn&#39;t working. I&#39;ll change once more&#39; as Simon watched Monica transformed into her mother. She picked up the clothes Monica had been wearing earlier and put them on.<br />
<br />
&#39;This body should be less distracting for you. Close your eyes and remember what it felt like to touch that male body, then try to relive that feeling&#39;<br />
<br />
Simon did so. She closed her eyes and imagined touching her own male body when Monica was wearing it. She replicated the feeling. <br />
<br />
She heard Monica&#39;s Mom say &#39;Yes something is happening. You&#39;re shimmering.&#39; Eagerly Simon opened her eyes and looked down. She was immediately disappointed to see that she was still female. She was still Monica.<br />
<br />
&#39;I thought you said I was changing?&#39; she sounded despairing.<br />
<br />
&#39;You shimmered. That&#39;s a good start. Maybe your body is still recuperating. I didn&#39;t change for days after I came out of my fever&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Did you go through everything I did? Did you get a shell?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No actually. At least not that I can remember. I was on my own and was very scared. Mom and Dad were on their last vacation. I was here alone. All I remember was waking up and 3 days of my life were missing. I remember where I was scratched swelling and turning purple but I don&#39;t remember having a shell&#39;.....&#39;Well I think I&#39;ll stay in Mom&#39;s body so long as you are in mine. When you have recovered we will try again. Your body will now have a memory of Simon&#39;s. Actually come and give me a cuddle and you will pick up how this body feels. To me it is very comforting&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;But how come I haven&#39;t got my own body. You said that when you got tired you would just revert to this body. Surely I should just have my own body when I&#39;m not shapeshifted. How come I have yours?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I don&#39;t know Simon and I will admit I&#39;m a little worried. When I was learning to shapeshift I would always revert back to the body you now have. However let&#39;s not worry about that for now. I was thinking we should celebrate you emerging from your shell. I certainly want to celebrate that I am no longer the only shapeshifter that I know about. How about we go out to dinner?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Like this?&#39; Simon gestured at her body.<br />
<br />
&#39;Why not Monica? I&#39;ll stay in this body and you call me Mom&#39; With that the true Monica gave Simon a cuddle. Simon was immediately overcome with feelings of comfort. She learnt what Monica&#39;s Mom&#39;s skin felt like.<br />
<br />
Simon pulled away &#39;Wow, You felt so different from before&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I told you everyone feels different. Now I for one want to change into something a bit more comfortable. These clothes no longer fit me very well. Are you happy to go out as you are?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah why not Mom. Everything is a new experience. I&#39;m just happy to be out of that shell&#39;</p>
