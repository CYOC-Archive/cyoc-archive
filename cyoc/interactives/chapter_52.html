<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was loving both his new power as well as the body he had acquired using the power, he was still anxious to see what 
<br>
 else he could do,He told the guy that he had bummed a ride from to take him down the street to a house that was under 
<br>
 construction it was a fairly large house and it would have alot of guys working on it he knew that it was in the framing 
<br>
 stage of the building and Ty was infatuated by the big brave framers and roofers that he new would be working on the 
<br>
 building. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty concentrated on the guy who gave him a ride to Tony's as they drove no sense in wasting a good time he thought, as 
<br>
 the guy drove him towards the house, he was a nice guy as far as Ty could tell and Ty was easily able to control the guy, 
<br>
 the guy didn't even know why he drove him to Tony's let alone what had happened while they were talking to Tony at Tony's 
<br>
 house, Ty had fixed it that way. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty was looking the guy over as they drove, he was sizing him up for the change that would befall the nice looking guy TY 
<br>
 figured he was probably in his early twenties, his bleached blonde hair was a little unruly and it was tucked under a cowboy 
<br>
 hat, and he was wearing what appeared to be wrangler jeans that were taut against his obviously well exercised thighs he 
<br>
 wasn't what Ty would call the ultimate fox but he wasn't bad looking though he had a rugged sort of look to him,that 
<br>
 reminded him of a ranch hand or a rodeo bull rider, he had on a long sleeve shirt with the sleeves buttoned around the tops 
<br>
 of his wrist they seemed like they were made for the guy at just the right length and all, not that they would stay the 
<br>
 right size though not if Ty had his way. 
<br>

<br>
 The guy did seem to ramble on though and to Ty he just asked to many questions to be completely trusted, he asked how old 
<br>
 Ty was and how come he wasn't at school and all, TY hadn't counted on this he knew he was now a very massive guy compared 
<br>
 to even this big macho cowboy, but he was still a very young looking young man, just a bit on the muscular side. Ty thought 
<br>
 about what to do with this ensesive talker and started with the guys voice maybe if he didn't like the way he sounded he'd 
<br>
 shut the fuck up, so he dropped his octaves a couple ranges till the guy sounded almost feminine, the guy didn't seem to 
<br>
 notice it though so he decided that he would take a little of the guys manhood away, and to TY he had an impressive manhood 
<br>
 indeed the bulge in his jeans had probably stretched the fabric of the jeans permanently. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty was again thinking of acquiring another asset to add to his own now, and he also thought about the fact that this 
<br>
 guy seemed to be able to pick up on his age quite easily, even with his new height and muscles, he still looked 15 years 
<br>
 old, so he thought he just take this cowboy back down memory lane just like the coach but this time he take the guys years 
<br>
 instead of wasting them away like he did the coaches only he wouldn't let himself get that old. It was Ty's turn to ask the 
<br>
 questions now &quot;How old are you mister?&quot; Ty asked innocently to the guy &quot;Ahh lets see not old enough to be your dad but old 
<br>
 enough!&quot; the guy replied, god he cant even give a strait answer TY thought to himself. &quot;Well how old is that then?&quot; Ty 
<br>
 asked again trying to be patient, &quot;27 years old dude!&quot; the guy said in his new higher tone, as he said it it seemed to 
<br>
 finally dawn on the guy that his voice sounded higher to him and he quickly came back with &quot;Although you wouldn't be able to 
<br>
 guess that by the way my voices sounds right now? He seemed a little confused as he drove and coughed to clear his now whinny sounding voice. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty was loving all this but he knew that the construction site was coming up real soon so he would have to take the guy 
<br>
 back a little in time real soon. Ty figured that 30 years old would give him a mature looking body that at his size would 
<br>
 command respect, from anyone that saw him, Ty did some figuring in his head and started to concentrate on the guy Ty was 
<br>
 going to have to make the guy 15 years younger and that the guy would then be only 12 years old so this guy wouldn't need 
<br>
 that honker of manhood in his jeans any way, so he took that first and as the guys size became his the guys bulge in his 
<br>
 jeans became more of a airy wrinkle as it was depleted of the frame work that supported it, Ty watched as it disappeared 
<br>
 from the guys crotch and almost laughed out loud. The guy started to say something but as the words came out of his mouth 
<br>
 he realized that his voice had changed dramatically, he really sounded like a kid now, his body had just been robbed of all 
<br>
 its mature testosterone and he sounded positively child like, he tried to clear his voice but that was to no avail, he just 
<br>
 sounded like a little kid coughing now. 
<br>

<br>
 Ty began the poor guys ride back in time physically, and just sat back and watched as he grew younger, Ty watched him 
<br>
 closely and for the first time since they left Tony's the guy was quite as he drove, he probably was feeling self conscious 
<br>
 about the way his voice sounded. Finally some peace and quiet Ty thought, Ty watched as the fabric of his once form fitting 
<br>
 shirt began to get a bit loose on him and then as the guy got younger his jeans began to get a little looser as well, and 
<br>
 the fabric of his once tight wranglers began to pool around his seated thighs as his legs shrank in his jeans, his once 
<br>
 perfect fitting sleeves were riding buttoned over his hands as he drove the car, he must have reached the age were he had 
<br>
 achieved his adult height by then and then he started to get shorter in his seat, he was begging to notice it and Ty was 
<br>
 enjoying the response to much to make him unaware of it. 
<br>

<br>
 apparently the guy had a late growth spurt or some thing because before Ty new it the guy was shrinking down in both 
<br>
 height and weight as he tried to maintain the car at 35 MPH, the guys cowboy hat was beginning to get to big for his head 
<br>
 and almost fell over his eyes, he quickly reached up with his left hand now almost covered to his palm by his shirt sleeve 
<br>
 and pushed the hat back out of his now younger face the poor guy was in a near state of panic as he noticed that his feet 
<br>
 no longer could touch the peddles as easily as a while ago, he began to slow down and was pulling over to the side of the 
<br>
 street, trying and almost uselessly to reach the brake peddle, he looked comical to Ty as he had to slide forward to reach 
<br>
 it &quot;WHAT THE HELLS GOING ON HERE!!!&quot; he yelled in a kids tone as he battled for control of his to him growing clothes and 
<br>
 truck. 
<br>

<br>
 The poor guys seat belt was tightening to fit his shrinking posture as he got younger, and Ty was enjoying it all, the guy 
<br>
 or should we say now young man had to undue his belt now to reach the brakes and he was now at the end of his seat with his 
<br>
 now baggy jeans and over sized shirt fighting him as he came to a complete stop. &quot;OH god what's happening to me? Please make 
<br>
 it stop o lord!!&quot; the guy said in a positively child like voice. The next thing the poor guy saw was the blue lights of a 
<br>
 patrol car that had watch him as his driving, hindered by Ty's little trick on the unsuspecting now kids driving changed 
<br>
 erratically as he did the same thing. TY had not thought about that though, and now he was the adult in the car and the 
<br>
 driver was a young boy of about 12 now.</p>
