<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;There&#39;s no way I can let Dad be the man of the house with this kind of power in my hands.&quot; Chris said as he started to type in the changes he wanted. &quot;He&#39;s my dad, so I still want him to retain some of his masculinity. So if I want to be the bigger man here, switching our ages should be the way to go. Chris typed in his age to his Dad&#39;s profile and vice versa. Doing so seemed to change the rest of the profile. <br />

&quot;Holy shit! I&#39;m gonna be a stud when I grow up!&quot; Chris admired his imagined physique. He heard his Dad drying his hair. &quot;Better get to changing right now or else.&quot; Chris typed in enter. The screen gave a timer of thirty seconds. &quot;That should give me some time.&quot; Chris said to himself as he got undressed, leaving him in nothing but his boxers. He looked at his body. He was as his profile had said average. He wasn&#39;t exactly a complete wimp, but neither was he a bodybuilder type. He grabbed his stomach, which was a little flabby and cupped his pecs which sagged a bit. &quot;Dad&#39;s is much worse... Though he won&#39;t be for long.&quot; Chris looked towards the screen and saw that five second left. &quot;Oh boy, here it comes!&quot; Chris watched the screen count down to zero. &quot;Confirming changes... Processing new parameters...&quot; The computer spoke. &quot;Changes confirmed and downloaded... Beginning transformation in ten seconds.&quot; Another timer appeared on the screen. &quot;Oh come on!&quot; Chris said exasperatedly. He waited for the other timer as it hit zero. &quot;Changes loaded and exported.&quot; &quot;Exported, so that means... Ah!&quot; Chris was blinded from a flash from the computer. After a few seconds, the white light started to fade. &quot;Was that the exporting then? So I should be... Agh!&quot; Chris felt a pain in his chest. He fell to his knees. &quot;Ah! My chest! Hngh!&quot; Chris struggled to manage the pain as he felt his body start to grow.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the bathroom, Mike Sanderson was finishing drying his hair, when he saw a bright light peek from the next room over. &quot;What was that?&quot; He finished drying his hair and was about to see what was going on. &quot;Ah... Whoa!&quot; Mike felt the wind kick out of him as he stumbled back onto the floor butt first. &quot;Oof! What was that about?&quot; Mike tried to get up when his stomach roared. &quot;Whoa! What going... on?&quot; Mike watched as his stomach started to deflate. &quot;Holy shit?!&quot; Mike got up. His fat was melting away. And not just on his stomach. The skin on his arms and legs were sliding down as if all of his fat was colliding to one point. It waved back and forth as it smoothed out on his skin and made him even skinnier. His stomach was half the size it once was. His hands and feet were shrinking and getting less stubby. His body hair was receding as well. &quot;What is going on?! Chris?!&quot; Mike opened the door and saw his son on the floor. &quot;Chris!&quot; He ran to his son, but something was different. His body was much more bigger then before and he could have swore his abdominal muscles were actually sticking out. He was also in nothing but his boxers. &quot;Dad?&quot; &quot;Chris? What&#39;s happening here?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m sorry. Ugh! Agh! I touched your delivery.&quot; Delivery? No way!&quot; He looked up at the contraption on the desk. &quot;You used the Chronivac?&quot; &quot;Yeah! Ugh! Oh god!&quot; &quot;What did you do?!&quot; &quot;I... I switched our ages. I&#39;m gonna be a 38 year old.&quot; &quot;And I&#39;m changing into a 16 year old?! Jesus Christ!&quot; Mike went up to the Chronivac. He tried to change it, but he was unable to do anything. &quot;Oh god! I&#39;m going to be a sixteen year old. And my son... My own son is going to be an adult. A fucking 38 year old stud.&quot; &quot;Dad... Ugh! Daddy!&quot; &quot;Oh Chris.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mike went towards his son and helped him up to the couch. He was at his eye level right now and he was having trouble holding him up. Chris was panting heavily. His growing pectorals and abdominal muscles pushed up and down. &quot;Ugh! Ah!&quot; Every so often, he would have a little seizure and shake violently. His growing hands gripped the couch and his growing feet slid around the floor. &quot;Oh god! It hurts! It hurts, Daddy!&quot; &quot;Calm down son. I need you to stay with me.&quot; Oh... Okay! Ah!&quot; &quot;Jesus...&quot; Mike sighed. He turned around. He hated himself for it, but his son&#39;s growing body was giving him and erection. His erect dick was only 7 inches now. &quot;Jeez Dad... You perv.&quot; &quot;Ah! Chris! This isn&#39;t what it looks like!&quot; &quot;Calm down Dad... Ah! Ugh! I know you&#39;re bisexual.&quot; &quot;Oh... Oh right... The Chronivac...&quot; Mike turned around, no longer hiding what he was feeling. &quot;I look like such a string bean now! And you! Jesus Christ, son. You might as well enter a competition with those abs!&quot; Chris touched his stomach and felt each square of muscle mass. &quot;I have a ten pack. If it didn&#39;t hurt like hell... Agh! I&#39;d be loving this.&quot; Chris grabbed onto his stomach in a pain again. As he looked down, he saw the tip of his erect dick sticking out from his boxers. &quot;Wow!&quot; &quot;Wow... is right... Jesus...&quot; &quot;Oh... Oh god! Sorry Dad!&quot; Chris pulled his boxers down and let his dick spring free. It was about 12 inches long now and thick as a beer can. &quot;Oh my!&quot; Mike watched his son&#39;s monster cock flop up and down. His erect, now six inch cock pulsed wildly. He hadn&#39;t felt this sexual urge since he was a teenager. &quot;Oh god! Amazing! I gotta...&quot; Chris grabbed onto his dick and proceeded to masturbate. &quot;Chris?!&quot; &quot;Ah,ah,ah! Oh god! This feels so good! Daddy!&quot; &quot;Holy shit! Ah!&quot; Mike&#39;s dick shook a bit. &quot;Ah,ah,ah! You too?! You gotta cum too?!&quot; &quot;No... No... I...&quot; &quot;Ah,ah,ah! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Let&#39;s do it together!&quot; &quot;No... No I can&#39;t... Ah... Oh god, I need to...&quot; Mike couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore. Without even touching his dick, Mike ejaculated. &quot;Ah,ah,ah! Oh god!&quot; &quot;Wow! Ah,ah,ah... You cummed... right a... right awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!&quot; Chris watched his father cum as he himself ejaculated onto himself. Streams of thick, ropy cum splattered onto his chest. Mike had his erection stick straight out, so he simply shot his load onto the floor. After about a dozen seconds or so, they stopped. Freckles and pimples appeared on Mike face, giving him the nerdy look he had as a sixteen year old. Chris spasmed once more, his muscular body weighed down on the couch as a small beard and mustache grew on his face. He looked up to his father, a look a horror was plastered on his face. &quot;Well looks like I&#39;m the man of the house now, dad!&quot;</p>
