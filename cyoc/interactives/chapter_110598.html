<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the werewolf pack slowly defurs and grabs robes for their modesty while being ushered into the many police cruisers; Beta two Approaches the sheriff.<br />
“Please tell Tachibana I need to speak to her right away. There are matters that she and my brother-in law need to be made aware of.”<br />
“Get in the cruiser,” Sheriff growling; “don’t make me rip your throat out like you had done to my cousin.”<br />
“I wasn’t the one who gave that order,” Beta Two snapping; “I was the one who recorded it and sent it to Tachibana. I’m the council spy. Now take me to the council building now!”<br />
<br />
The Luna brotherhood members who heard what was just said started growling; uttering “traitor” and “pack betrayer”.<br />
“Looks like you made friends,” Sheriff Copper smirking; “perhaps I’ll stick you in the same cell as them.”<br />
“Do so at your own peril,” Beta two answers; “the Alpha married my twin sister. It’s her you have to watch out for if anything happens to me.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Back at the council building; Tachibana and the rest of the council member sigh in relief as news of Julie being captured at the edge of the lake just reached them. The Alpha finding out that the Sheriff was there as well as a posse of armed deputies; he knew the pack that was to escort Julie and surreptitiously hunt her and kill her, claiming an accident in her escaping was going to fold like a wet noodle under integration. Together they were strong; but alone each werewolf looked out for themselves. The Alpha knew he and his Betas were going to feel the burn on this.<br />
<br />
“Don’t go anywhere Greg,” Tachibana using the Alpha’s real name; “The council has questions for you. Questions they want answers with.”<br />
“I don’t suppose,” Greg sighing; “that this can go away quietly.”<br />
“No amount of Ben Franklins,” Tachibana sneering;  “across the paws of the council member is going to silence this matter. You and the rest of your chapter will be made accountable of your actions.”<br />
“Please,” Greg whispering; “for the sake of all weres. Don’t drag this into the light.”<br />
“I don’t’ need to,” Tachibana answering; “your brother in law did. He was my spy in your organization. Plus by now; the other Luna Chapters the world over are in damage control. Having to agree to the demands of the many secret were-communities, as they start questioning the trustworthiness of your organizations ability to protect them.”<br />
“There is no way that what was done to Alyssa Cooper could reach the paws and ears of every Luna Alpha,” Greg answers.<br />
“Well,” Tachibana grins; “a heavily encrypted transmission over the internet does make relaying pertinent information to a few trusted agents easy. Your Beta two isn’t the only spy I have in the Luna Brotherhood.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Lance Knight with his girlfriend Lila Carpenter smile as they lay on the ground in a private chamber of the council building. With Lance’s member buried deep in Lila’s eager sex, each enjoying their afterglow and body heat as Lance spoons and cradles Lila.<br />
“Will we be able to go home soon,” Lila purring; “I want you in our bed.”<br />
“Was what we just had,” Lance cupping Lila’s breasts and kneading them gently with his paws; “not up to snuff?”<br />
“Oh it was wonderful,” Lila purring; “but I want to have you without being disturbed by a page or an attendant.”<br />
“You know we have my parents to meet,” Lance now nibbling on one of Lila ears; “do you not want to meet them?”<br />
“I do,” Lila giggling as Lance’s nibbling tickles her; “but today being what it is, I want you all to myself. Now fill me up again my were-panther stud.”<br />
“Gladly,” Lance growling as his softening member still in Lila goes hard as he begins thrusting; “my eager were-tigress mate.”<br />
<br />
Lila swoons as she feels the barbs on Lance’s member dig into her once again; stimulating her to another orgasm as she bucks her hips in unison to Lance thrusting from behind her. Placing Lances paws on her hips as she moans and purrs; enjoying the feeling of being enveloped and filled by a strong virile male.<br />
“Oh yeah,” Lila moaning; “fill me with your seed. Claim me, I’m yours!”<br />
<br />
Lance growls as he picks up the pace with his thrusting; his barbs causing Lila to gasp and squeal as they dig into her every time he pulls out and pushes back in. Feeling his balls starting to clench and churn; Lance growls as he feels his orgasm rocket through him and spill into Lila. Lila feeling Lance tense and the barbs on his member dig into her deeply as her body shudders in its own orgasm.<br />
“OH god,” Lila yowling; “make this feeling last forever!”<br />
<br />
Lance grinning as he hugs Lila even deeper; not caring that a page listened in on their last bout of passion. Glaring at the were-rat to scram as he looks up to see him waiting; Lance had no intention of leaving his soon to be wife and mother of his cubs. Both purring as Lila buried herself deeper into Lance’s loving embrace.<br />
“Did I just smell a were-rat,” Lila sighing.<br />
“I scared him off,” Lance resting his chin on Lila’s head.<br />
“Does this mean you have to attend a council session,” Lila yawning.<br />
“They don’t need me,” Lance wrapping his arms hugging Lila; “Tachibana and the rest would have to pull me away from you. And I’m not going to let that happen.”<br />
“We should get up,” Lila trying to stay awake; “I want to sleep in a soft bed. Not on hard marble flooring.”<br />
“All right,” Lance letting go and getting up; “Let’s go home.”<br />
<br />
Lila swooning as she feels Lance’s still hard member pulling out of her as Lance helps her up. Leaving the chamber; the were-panther and were-tigress each smile and grinning as they quietly walk to the building entrance. Tachibana staring at the two as they walk away despite the council about to be called in session; she silently nods as it is clear that Lance and Lila have every intention of continuing their coupling in a more private setting. With the whole council and staff hearing the couple’s lovemaking; she allows the two to leave and head home.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps we should all take a cue from our fellow were-panther rep,” Andrew smiling; “call it a day head on home.”<br />
“There are still questions that the Luna brotherhood must answer to,” Tachibana stating; “and I want the truth. Not for them to have the time and spin a story of lies.”<br />
“Let the sheriff keep the pack that was just arrested on ice for a bit,” Andrew stating; “have their Alpha remain here under guard in a room bugged so we can hear anything he might say.”<br />
“I suppose,” Tachibana responding; “but I want everyone here in the morning as well as Julie Stovall. This matter will be brought to a swift finale.”</p>
