<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Good morning everyone today we are going to discuss puberty&quot; mister Wang decides.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh great the talk about the birds and the bees.&quot; Ryan said just loud enough to be heard by the people surrounding him.<br />
<br />
Ryan was a school athlete. Long, muscular and overall well build. He was sitting in the seat next to Jen so normally they could talk a bit during class. Normally Jen welcomes their interaction, she considered Ryan to be a casual friend but Jen was not so willing to get into much conversation because of the curse. Their casual talking often meant a distraction from the lesson being thought but today it would prove to be more than the two not picking up everything that was being taught.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Jen, can you believe they are really still teaching us about this kind of stuff? The internet has taught me everything I need to know about puberty and sex. What does this old man still thinks he can teach us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen knew Ryan his first question was not meant to be literal. Everyone knew the teachers had to cover this subject even if they already knew that the students would not learn anything from it. The curse was not into these kinds of subtleties however and made Jen lies about everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Ryan. I can&#39;t believe they will try to teach us the basics. I think mister Wang is going to be very direct and unprofessional during the class. He is probably going to use the words penis, boobs and puberty a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish, at least that would be somewhat entertaining&quot; Ryan remarked just as mister Wang saw the two chatting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan, Jennifer pay attention! I am trying to teach you something that can be every important for you later in life. Why do you think I am covering puberty and it&#39;s effects on penises and boobs today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was a bit caught of guard by mister Wang his casual use of words he would normally never utter in front of his students and was not quick enough to think of a carefully formatted lie so she just said the first thing that came to her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because every time you say puberty, penis or boobs during the class your students their penises and boobs grow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No of course not. If you say suck an absurd thing again I will give you detention!&quot; Mister Wang shouted to Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Jen was dumbstruck, She really thought that was the right answer. Or did the curse just make her think she thought it was the right answer? She could not tell. Meanwhile, mister Wang had resumed his lesson.<br />
<br />
&quot;The function of puberty is to produce sexually mature adults&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen could feel her chest tighten and her penis extent a tiny bit at those words. Looking at Ryan she could also see him shift his weight in this chair a tiny bit as the same change happened to everyone in the class. It seems like the curse has taken full effect after all. Jen just begged the lesson would be over soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Puberty has many effects on the human body. Boys will rapidly grow in size catching up to girls in height and then surpassing them. The penis of a man will also swell during this period in order for the boy to later father his own children&quot;<br />
<br />
That was two more. Jen could both parts of her body grow again. Her chest was starting to stretch her top a bit and the bulge under her skirt was more and more present. Trying to think about something else Jen went and looked over the class. She could see Ryan and Amanda from her seat but not Susan who was located behind her.<br />
<br />
The sight of Amanda gave Jen a small chuckle. It seems like she was not spared of the changing effects of the curse as her chest as well as her udder had grown several times now. This left the girls goat udder hang down and almost reach her knees as her breast pulled her clothing tight. Jen thought it served her right.<br />
<br />
Looking at Ryan she could see he also had gained quit a few inches. The bulge in his pants had grown significantly. He did not seem very comfortable but he could still keep his sausage inside his pants with easy.<br />
<br />
The rest of the students Jen could see had similar undergone experiences. Even the girls that would normally be called flat did now at least have noticeable humps on their chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls their boobs will grow during puberty. This will happen so that they may later provide a child with the feeding it needs to grow up&quot; mister Wang went on<br />
<br />
There were several pangs after these lines as bras broke. Nobody seemed to panic at their rapidly growing bodies however and the students just tried to cope with their ever more uncooperative bodies. The only exception to this rule came from Susan who suddenly called herself to attention by asking a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mister Wang my skirt broke may I go gather something at lost and found?&quot; Susan asked as if it was the most normal thing in the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course but be quick I do not want you to miss much of the class.&quot; Mister Wang replied.<br />
<br />
With his blessing Susan went to the classroom door finally giving Jennifer a look at her friend. Susan had grown a lot during the class. It seemed that her horse cock had grown so much it had broken the band of her skirt and was now hanging free in the air as it was slightly attacked to her stomach. Her shirt was also suffering under the constraint her larger chest but that was not more different from the other girls in the class.<br />
<br />
It did not take long before Susan returned. Somehow she had found a pair of wide jogging pants. Her equipment still left quite the mark of the over sized clothes but at leas she was covered again Jen thought as she was suddenly interrupted by a question from mister Wang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer would you tell us what further effects hormones have on the body during puberty?&quot;<br />
<br />
A colletive groan went through the class as mister Wang asked the question.</p>
