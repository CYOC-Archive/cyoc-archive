<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff figured that since he had used the Chronivac to turn himself into his own mom to have new experiences, he should keep having new experiences.  No point in going home this early in the day when he could go into a bar for the first time.  So he walked into Casey&#39;s.<br />
The bar was pretty empty at this point in the afternoon, so he went up to the bar and took a seat.  The bartender came up, and in a friendly voice said, &quot;so, what&#39;ll it be?&quot;<br />
Jeff froze.  He knew there were a whole bunch of different kinds of alcoholic drinks, but he had no idea what would make him look like an idiot or not.  Just as he was about to panic, he remembered hearing references to how women like a drink called a &quot;cosmo.&quot;  He figured he might as well try.  &quot;Could I have a cosmo?&quot; he asked innocently, hoping it wasn&#39;t a stupid question.<br />
The bartender smiled and went away, coming back a minute or two later with a bright pink drink in a glass that was shaped like an upside-down triangle.  He picked it up gingerly to avoid spilling it, and took a sip.  He had tried alcohol once or twice before, and found the harsh taste difficult to swallow.  This one, though, was fruity and tart, and you could hardly notice it was alcoholic at all, at least if you sipped it.  He understood why people liked it.  <br />
The bartender stood there patiently, and Jeff remembered he had to pay.  He went into his mom&#39;s purse and fished out her credit card.  &quot;Do you want to start a tab?&quot; asked the bartender.  &quot;Sure,&quot; said Jeff, not knowing what that meant, but then the bartender left with the credit card and didn&#39;t come back.<br />
Jeff turned and noticed that there was a football game on, with a group of mostly dudes watching.  Jeff couldn&#39;t believe he had forgotten all about the game in all the commotion with the Chronivac, so he took a seat near the TV and started watching with the group.<br />
He actually ended up having a great time.  It was a good group, everyone was friendly, and he even got a couple more cosmos.  He decided being in a bar was fun, but he also knew that people might be so nice to him because he was in the body of a somewhat older, but still fairly attractive woman.  During the game he kept subtly adjusting his bra just to remind himself of this new body he had.  <br />
At the end of the first half, Jeff noticed that he had to go pee, so he went to the bathroom at halftime.  This was his first time peeing as a woman or using this new pussy he had, and he was curious what it would be like.  It was crazy walking into the women&#39;s bathroom, though in practice it looked exactly the same as any men&#39;s bathroom, except there were extra toilets instead of urinals, and there was a separate bar with a mirror where a couple of women were putting on makeup.  They said hello as Jeff went into a stall, and he wondered again if everyone was just friendlier to him as a woman.<br />
He looked at the toilet.  Not sure how to do it, he reached under his dress, pulled down his panties past his knees, lifted up the dress in his arms, and then sat down.  It was a little awkward but he thought he got it right.  It then felt a little weird peeing out of a hole in his body instead of out of his penis, but it was a similar muscle to flex.  It sprayed around a little more coming out of his body, but otherwise it was basically the same thing with a slightly more pungent smell. He remembered to use a couple pieces of toilet paper to wipe off his pussy, and then he flushed and left the stall.<br />
&quot;So I haven&#39;t seen you here before,&quot; one of the women said to him as he washed his hands.  He didn&#39;t really know what to say, so he just kept up the small talk.  &quot;Yeah, my husband&#39;s out of town for a little while, so I thought I&#39;d just go do something for myself,&quot; he said, figuring that was reasonable enough.<br />
&quot;Oooh,&quot; the woman said, and both women at the makeup stand looked at each other.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Jeff.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t have too much fun here,&quot; the other woman said.  &quot;Some of those guys are going to start hitting on you, if they haven&#39;t already, and they&#39;re not going to care that you have that ring on your finger.&quot;<br />
Jeff pretended to be surprised and a little disgusted, but really he was intrigued.  These guys are going to want to have sex with him?  He thought back to when he was licking the ice cream at the ice cream store, and the way that teenager behind the counter looked at him.  He had never had sex before, and as a dude he wasn&#39;t exactly getting hit on left and right.  The idea that, as a woman, he could now have sex whenever he wanted seemed really fascinating to him.  He knew he shouldn&#39;t, but it was amazing to know that he could.  He checked himself in the mirror and left the bathroom.<br />
Jeff got back to his seat just as the second half started.  One of the guys who Jeff had been talking to leaned over to him.  &quot;Hey, a few of us are going to order some wings.  Are you gonna stick around?&quot;</p>
