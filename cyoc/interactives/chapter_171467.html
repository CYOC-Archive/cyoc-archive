<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not all of the new arrivals in Dino City related to issues that challenged laws and the beliefs of those in Dino City&#39;s government. One was more of a sort of family reunion in a way as Penny Davidson arrived in Dino City in a rental car. It was a nice rental, but not necessarily the brand that she preferred. Her father Patrick had worked hard and made a lot of money through the diamond trade, though mostly in the mining of the precious gems. It brought in a lot of money and had given Penny a relatively easy start in life, at least with regard to financial matters and she tended to enjoy it quite a bit. Fine cars, fine food, luxury sweets, and all the perks that came with it were all hers, and it also brought in some interest in a related field to where her father had made his money.<br />
<br />
For diamonds were precious, even in their unrefined state. But that worth only mattered when properly cut, polished, and placed within the appropriate jewelry that made the diamonds shine and glitter even more. That got her an opening into the industry when it came to designing the the fittings and cuts for the precious jewels. She hadn&#39;t made as much money as her father, but she&#39;d done well enough that his wealth wasn&#39;t in danger of being sapped. Her father&#39;s decision to join Animalia, and particularly the Dinotopians in Dino City was a bit of a surprise, but Penny also saw it as a bit of an opportunity. As while Animalians tended be resistant to various elements of Human society, beauty and display were not necessarily among them. And the Dinotopians presented something of an intriguing option in that regard as all the things like spikes and spines could make accessorizing with some bling could work, and Penny looked forward to that challenge.<br />
<br />
And the arrival gave her some impressions as she drove through Dino City on the way to where her father had said he&#39;d taken up residence. While they weren&#39;t the high class mansions and apartments that she was used to, the sheer scale of the buildings was impressive, and Penny had to admit that. There was also plenty of reason for her to accept and understand that as she drove along. There were some Humans that she saw as she drove through, and some of that made sense as Dino City had been built in an area that ultimately incorporated some rural Human residents into the new Animalian Colony city, but the impressive part was in seeing some of the Dinotopians that were out and about as they went about their day. One that caught her attention the most was a male Sauropod Dinotopian that was doing some sweeping along the sidewalk, and what stood out were the paired sets of spines from the back of his neck, and Penny couldn&#39;t help but ponder on figuring out ways to make that &quot;sparkle&quot; as it were.<br />
<br />
Eventually she pulled into the driveway of the home that her father had said she was living in now while waiting to see what would likely be the base of operations for things for the immediate future. From what she knew, he&#39;d become a Tyrannotitan Dinotopian and that he was a bit smaller than Dino City&#39;s resident Tyrannosaurus, but NOT by all that much. That left a rather curious line of thought in Penny&#39;s mind, and she made her way up to the door with no fear. After all, while some of the &quot;animal instinct&quot; issue was stronger with Dinotopians and Cenozoic Mammal Animalians, that was well known now and she was sure her father had had to go through a lot of the extended periods of learning to prepare for those instincts. How much he processed on the actual animal was likely not as high as some of the scientists that had converted to become Animalians, but Penny did expect that her father had all the instincts under control. That was soon proved after she reached the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Penny! Princess!&quot; came Patrick Diamond&#39;s voice as he opened the door and came through, scooping her up into a big hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were waiting for me, daddy?&quot; Penny answered with a small smile after Patrick set her down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Patrick smiled down to her, &quot;you accepted my decision and were even willing to convert too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Penny nodded as she looked around the area, &quot;a shame they didn&#39;t have the room for mansions... but... I suppose that&#39;s how it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Patrick nodded, &quot;there are other states that would have had more room... but Texas was their choice, and with the exception of some hippies... Dino City isn&#39;t too bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I saw the clip of you roaring at them and giving them quite a fright,&quot; Penny answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I had to pay a fine for that,&quot; Patrick admitted with a chuckle as he admitted Penny in, &quot;but they essentially deserved it... Complaining about things that had little to do with the diamond or jewelry industries and making little sense. It was worth it in my book.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny nodded as she set her bags down and then looked over her father for the moment. The Dinotopians all presented some revolution in understanding how dinosaurs were built and covered, particularly with regard to which had feathers and which had scales. Some of the reports out of Project Mesozoic had given that as the &quot;final&quot; verdict on which was which. And some did have feathers, as the Animalia Ambassadoria videos had shown, but not all, and from what Penny could see, her father was among those that didn&#39;t have feathers. The skin and scales that he had sort of looked more like a bird&#39;s than like a reptile&#39;s, but she couldn&#39;t see any feathers. Of course, it was possible that Tyrannotitan would have had only sparse or light covering of feathers that would have been concealed by the clothes that her father wore.<br />
<br />
And his transformation had reflected the size that the Dinotopians could have. He had been taller than her before, but now he practically towered over her, and likely over the tallest Human ever. He was also well muscled and with broad shoulders, with sturdy arms that ended in four fingers, counting the thumb. Some of that made sense, given what was known about Dinotopians. Most normal Animalians seemed to keep all their Human digits on their hands, and it would only be with their feet where any real alterations occurred, but Dinotopians seemed to be different. Those that had become Theropod Dinotopians seemed to lose some fingers so that they had the same number of digits that the animal had plus the thumb, thus a Tyrannosaur Dinotopian would have three fingers in total while a Carnosaur Dinotopian would have four fingers, and Tyrannotitan was a large Carnosaur.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re looking good, daddy,&quot; Penny commented, &quot;strong and healthy again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... and glad to have all natural teeth again,&quot; Patrick answered with a toothy grin, giving Penny a good look at the blade-like teeth that filled his muzzle, &quot;though as I said... I could have something for you to work on with regard to my old fillings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Penny nodded, &quot;an interesting challenge... though a bit puzzling as well. Are you going for some kind of &quot;trophy hunter&quot; type of look? Like all the big predator Dinotopians have taken to going after wild pigs here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; Patrick answered, &quot;the ranchers don&#39;t like the pigs and the Dinotopians seem strong enough to go after them in a way that Texas doesn&#39;t have natural predators for. They can&#39;t do this in the cities... but with no hunting season on wild boar, the ranchers seem to have some interest in letting the Dinotopians hunt for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You going to get into that? Big game hunting?&quot; Penny inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really sure,&quot; Patrick answered, &quot;I talked with their Tyrannosaur... a Dr. Rex Ramos... and that&#39;s PhD doctor, not Md doctor... and their Mr. M... who&#39;s a bigger Carnosaur Dinotopian... I can&#39;t pronounce the species name, it&#39;s long... and they have different methods. Dr. Ramos says that he and the others like him would try to crush the pig&#39;s neck, and could include grabbing it by a back leg to get it down. Mr. M said that he would try to get the pig by a leg... or the flank between the leg and the ribs and then just slice out out enough that the pig would bleed out. If it is brought down to where it is laying down... he might go for the throat... and that has to mean they have different strategies. So I really don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll actually get into hunting. I might just enjoy the money I have and just work with some hobbies. I mean... this home was cheep enough, even with my youth restored, I have enough that I might not NEED to earn more to support myself financially. So... what I&#39;d do and earn is more to have a hobby and something to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you may have to pay for your bling, you know that, right?&quot; Penny asked, &quot;Diamonds aren&#39;t easy to work with and unless you&#39;re looking for more common metals for the chain for your tooth necklace... that could also be a bit pricy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True...&quot; Patrick nodded, &quot;but Patrick Diamond will have his ways to make money... and we could find something marketable, even if Dinotopians aren&#39;t the buyers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny smiled and nodded at that, &quot;and you know how much I love bling... both wearing it and designing it.&quot;</p>
