<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ted lay there in those weeds as his feet stuck out just a few inches into the roadway. The sunshine and chilly air made for a mixture to keep him in a dreamy state until his slumbering brain felt the touch of something wet.<br />
<br />
Flickering eye lids opened to a blurry world. The sound of blustery winds rushing through the tall grass made for his hearing to be somewhat impaired. It was the sense of being touched by something slithery and wet that jolted him back to his reality.<br />
<br />
Another and then two more sensations of some dark figure looming above his face was making the funny feelings happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mister, are you all right?&quot; asked a friendly voice.<br />
<br />
Helping hands scooped up Ted's shoulders and brought him to a sitting position. It was then that he felt the weight of the silver coin slip from his forehead to fall against his thigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back off, go on get, now get!&quot; said the voice as if ordering away maybe an animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that but Benny was so overjoyed in finding you he was becoming a pest. Heck his summer coat of fur is stuck all over you, wherever he licked you got tons of his fur.&quot; said the manly voice of some friendly sort.<br />
<br />
Ted felt very whoosie, his head hurt but now too his body felt strange as well.<br />
<br />
The blurred vision slowly cleared and there kneeling next to him was a young man in his twenties. A multi speed bike lay along the roadway, as off to the otherside and in the ditch was Benny sniffing around. Ted saw the dog's tail zig zagging about the weeds as if he was on the trail of something even more interesting.<br />
<br />
Slowly Ted got to his feet but was quite shaken by the smacking hit of the small stone. His temple showing a small trickle of blood suggested he might be worse off then fist thought. The road being quite rural at that point offered no easy way to get Ted any quick help.<br />
<br />
The friendly man suggested Ted sit down on the roadside, as he would peddle down the road seeking a house with a phone.<br />
<br />
Ted, reluctantly agreed as he felt so sick to his stomach, and light headed as well.<br />
<br />
Man and dog headed off down the road as Ted sat there wishing he had turned around and gone home. It was as he sat there he noticed many strange scents that until right then he never knew even existed. Sniffing the wafting currents of air, Ted thought of the silver coin and slowly got up on hands and knees to search for his treasure.<br />
<br />
The rank smell of Benny's saliva was hitting his nose and so too was the loose hairs that were caught in the sticky spit licked on and over Ted's face. He took to looking for the coin but oddly found his eyesight losing the ability to see in color. <br />
<br />
Tones of light and dark grays became his line of vision and this made Ted worry of his injury. He continued to move about the weeds his nose to the ground as he began to feel surprisingly content. <br />
<br />
At last he found the bright shiny medallion standing on it's edge and leaning against a dandelion stalk.<br />
<br />
Happy for his find, Ted reached to grab it in the palm of his hand. Try after failed try he was not able to pick it up. His fingers were stubby, tucked tightly together they had now long black fingernails.<br />
<br />
Try after try was making his conent feeling wain, he felt agravatied, then got angry at the medallion as if it was being unreasonable.<br />
<br />
So up set at the failed tries to pick it up Ted let loose a scream of absolute insult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whahuck Whahuck, Whahuck, Grrrrr!&quot; is what issued out of Ted's mouth.<br />
<br />
The instant the sounds died off into the fall breeze Ted felt suddenly baffled. He had thought in words but what was spoken came out like silly doggy barks and a growl.<br />
<br />
Turning back to the road and giving up on the medallion Ted sat on the spot where he was told to stay, and waited there for the man's return.<br />
<br />
Car after car flew by tossing at Ted some more stones but this time they hit with less force. The sun seemed extra hot, and Ted began to breath faster as if doing so would disapate his body heat. <br />
<br />
Sounds were all around him as he sat there. They and the many new smells in the air were urging Ted to follow his nose and investigate. The longing desire to check out the scents was over powering and soon, nose to the gorund he was off on a quest.<br />
<br />
Sniffing the trail of something his mind said was very interesting, Ted was off on a fast walk through the weeds and under a fence. Out into a pasture he went his sniffing making the urgency of finding something even more a game than being necessary. <br />
<br />
Zig and zagging about he was busy until from the roadway came the sound of a man upset. <br />
<br />
Ted raised his head and listened to the man yell. It was then from that direction came the scent of someone who might be a friend. Ted headed for the smell as fast as he could run. Zooming alone he leaped high and cleared the fence in one long jump. Landing on the gorund he skidded on his flat rump, slidding up onto the stoney road.<br />
<br />
&quot;Benny! No your Benny, but who are you?&quot; asked the man to Ted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whahack!&quot; said Ted.<br />
<br />
Eyes shifted side to side, Ted began to think why he answered the man so strangely. He looked up at the man wondering why he was not standing, rahter than seated on the ground.<br />
<br />
Feeling the urgency to talk to the friendly man Ted jumped up and stood rather shaky in an upright position. Feeling the need for more support he leaned on the man's shoulders, as this left him in an eyes to eyes stance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it big fella your bigger than Benny!&quot; said the man making Ted wonder about his condition all the more.<br />
<br />
The man as much insulted Ted by taking his hands to Ted's head and scrubbing his ears and then his lower jaw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whahack!&quot; barked Ted again, this time feeling the saggy movement of his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Benny I thought you were a big Newfoundland mut, but this guy is twice as big as you!&quot; said the man to his dog but in as much informed Ted he was not the same as when he got up that morning.<br />
<br />
Now Ted slowly moved his head to look down. As lps slung to one side and ears flopped over too, Ted saw the thick black shaggy fur coat of a dog had grown out his skin. Worse yet was the definate hind doggy legs that supported him as he stood leaning on the friendly man.<br />
<br />
Ted's sensation of euphoria was coming again and he watched his long black hairy tail flag about. Wanting in the worst way to plead for help Ted tried to speak as the man back stepped letting Ted fall to all fours.<br />
<br />
As Ted stood there he felt the cold wet nose of Benny shoved under his tail and sniffing what to a human was insulting. Now Ted turned around, but doing so his doggish brain suggested this as an act of friendly notice of another. Ted returned the compliment, then standing there let Benny reach his nose under Ted's groin and sniff his penis.<br />
<br />
The mindless euphoria ensued and Ted took to running by the side of Benny as like father and son went off on the hunt.<br />
<br />
The man laughed and was getting on his bike to follow his two dogs when he remembered the shiny silver coin that was resting on the fallen man's forehead.<br />
<br />
Searching the weeds he discovered the man's clothing, shoes, wallet, and finally the coin.</p>
