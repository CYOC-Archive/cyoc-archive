<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a long period of silence, Amy had an idea. Mara sorta looked like a bird, just like the chickens on her farm.  If Amy wished that Mara could lay eggs like her chickens, she could have her own family in no time.  Amy knew that the eggs had to be fertilized by the roosters, otherwise no chicken would come out of the egg.  But she could just wish that Mara would fertilize her own eggs.<br />
<br />
Amy flew over Mara&#39;s head, and concentrated on her wish.  She wished that Mara would lay eggs like her chickens.  But that her body would change so the eggs would produce  Gryphons, and that the eggs would already be fertilized.  Amy&#39;s body began to glow brightly.  Mary was looking ahead, so she didn&#39;t notice to the shining fairy hovering above her back.  Pixie dust drifted down onto her back.  It tickled, and  her back bristled, but she was unaware that Amy was using her magic on her again.  <br />
<br />
Amy flew in front of Mara.  She was excited.  She couldn&#39;t wait until Mara laid her first egg.  The little baby Gryphon would be so cute! And Mara would be so happy that she wasn&#39;t alone anymore.<br />
<br />
As Mary walked, her body began to change.  Her ovaries changed, and began to produce a different kind of egg.  One that would develop a hard shell as it traveled through her fallopian tubes and into her cloaca.  Mary felt a stirring in her abdomen, and felt a few painful cramps as her reproductive system continued to change.  She gripped her abdomen in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mara, are you okay?&quot; asked Amy fearfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing. Just some cramps, &quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
Amy looked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s something that happens to women when they menstruate.  You&#39;ll understand when you are older, &quot; said Mary.<br />
<br />
Great, just great, thought Mary as she continued to walk.  On top of everything I  am getting my period.<br />
 <br />
But Amy knew better.  She could barely contain her excitement.  Mary was already beginning to produce her eggs.<br />
<br />
As they continued to walk, Mary&#39;s body continued to change.  The combination of the hormones produced by her new reproductive system and Amy&#39;s wish for her body to be able to produce Gryphons was slowly changing her body into that of a real Gryphon.  Her hinds quarters were beginning to look more feline.  Her hands and  feet began to look more like the talons of an eagle and the paws of a cat.  Mara&#39;s body grew a little bit larger, getting stronger with leaner, more well-defined muscle.  Her tail began to look more like a lion&#39;s tail, with a small tuft of tawny fluffy fur at the tip.  In the dark, neither Amy nor Mara noticed the subtle changes.<br />
<br />
What Mary did notice was her increasing abdominal pain as the egg inside her matured.  Her belly swelled slightly as the egg grew larger.  Mary brushed it off as water weight.  But finally the pain grew too intense to ignore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a second, kid.  I think I need to rest a bit, &quot; said Mary, as she plopped to the ground.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Mara.  Take your time, &quot; said Amy.  <br />
<br />
She watched Mara with excitement.  The pain in Mary&#39;s abdomen intensified.  She felt a pressure there, almost like she had to evacuate her bowels.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, God, &quot; grunted Mary, as she squatted on her haunches, and began to push.  She felt the pressure increase, as something began to slide down through her cloaca.  She continued to grunt and push for several agonizing minutes, until a large smooth white egg popped out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; said Mary, as she stared at the egg that had come out of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, you are a Mommy!&quot; said Amy.  &quot;Aren&#39;t you so happy?  Now you aren&#39;t alone!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary glared at her.  &quot;YOU!  Did you do this to me?&quot; spat Mary angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to thank me, &quot; said Amy proudly.<br />
<br />
Mary sprang forward, gripping the fairy tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you?  I should kill you!  I don&#39;t want to be a mother to the monster inside that thing.  We need to destroy it! &quot; said Mary angrily.<br />
<br />
Amy slipped out of her grasp, and flew over her head.  &quot;How could you say such terrible things about your own baby?  It is beautiful, just like you.  I just wish that you loved that egg as much as I do.  And I wish you would act more like a mother to your children!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy glowed, and pixie dust filtered down onto Mary&#39;s head.  She tried to brush the dust out of her eyes and face.  Amy was unaware of what she had done, and flew down to protect the egg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you don&#39;t want it, I will take it.  I will raise this child as my own, and love it and feed it ...... &quot; began Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;GET AWAY FROM THAT EGG!&quot; shouted Mary suddenly, as she knocked Amy away, and cradled the egg protectively against her chest.<br />
<br />
Mary turned and saw the frightened fairy recovering on the ground, rubbing her sore shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, &quot; mumbled Mary.  &quot;But I thought you might accidentally hurt it.  I just want to keep the egg safe, protect it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mary was confused by her feelings for the egg. For some reason, she felt very possessive of it.  She kinda wanted to see what it would look like when it hatched.  She wanted to help the young creature, nurture it and protect it as it grew.  Maybe teach it how to hunt and survive on its own.  She imagined siblings for the creature, a whole family of them frolicking around her.  And it filled her with joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, &quot; said Amy glumly.  &quot;If you want to take care of it, fine.  It is your egg after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary stared at the egg, mesmerized by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my egg .... my child, &quot; said Mary softly.  She shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts and focus on her escape.  &quot;C&#39;mon.  We need to keep moving.  I don&#39;t want those hunters to catch up with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy and Mary moved further into the cave.  Mary cupped the egg protectively against her chest as they walked.</p>
