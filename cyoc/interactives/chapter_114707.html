<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Like hell,&quot; Caleb said, crossing his arms and looking from the 8th grade version of Courtney to Derrick.  &quot;What if I get turned into stone or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;d better wait for Sara to get back, anyway,&quot; Jenna said, looking down the hall to where Sara had gone.  &quot;Wonder what&#39;s taking her so long... you don&#39;t think she went to finish the job, do you?&quot;  She looked devilishly at Courtney, who frowned in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave her alone,&quot; Derrick protested, feeling more protective over his diminished girlfriend.  She sat hugging her knees, bra cups smashed flat agains her chest and the legs of her shorts sagging to the ground.  Derrick wondered if she had any old clothes she could put on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on, it&#39;s kinda funny,&quot; Jenna push forward.  &quot;Hey Court, who&#39;s the first boy you frenched?&quot;<br />
<br />
Courtney gasped at the question as Derrick made a noise of protest.  Her mind seemed foggy.  She was having a hard time remembering a lot of important things.  &quot;I... I haven&#39;t kissed anyone like that,&quot; she answered, sounding a bit unsure.<br />
<br />
Jenna burst out laughing, and Caleb smiled.  Derrick wasn&#39;t amused.  He focused on Jenna and thought to himself, &quot;I wonder if I can use my power on her, just a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenna&#39;s laughter died off and she settled back onto the couch.  Was it his imagination, or did her nipples seem suddenly erect under her clothes?  Derrick looked hard and saw that, sure enough, her nipples stood out against the fabric of her tight shirt.  As he looked on, Jenna closed her eyes slowly and slid a hand down the inside of her thigh, resting it near her crotch.  Derrick concentrated a bit more, and was rewarded with a quiet moan from Jenna, as she arched her back sightly and goosebumps erupted on her arms.<br />
<br />
Sara&#39;s reappearance distracted the others, so Derrick took the opportunity for one last push, and Jenna gasped, her eyes flying open and locking onto Derrick&#39;s.  He could see a wet spot standing out against the fabric on the crotch of her athletic shorts.  She gave him a coy smile and winked.  Derrick was taken aback - not exactly the reaction he had expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go!&quot; Jenna suddenly said, as Sara sat back down gingerly next to Caleb.  She reached forward and slapped the glass bubble.  The number 9 appeared, and off she went, taking a right at the first fork.  Her token ended up on a green space, and everyone leaned in as green letters emerged from the smoke:<br />
<br />
Your baggage has been lost!<br />
Move ahead two spaces, since you&#39;re traveling lighter.<br />
Pick another player to steal luggage from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Jenna said, sliding her token up two spaces.  &quot;And as for the luggage...?&quot; she flicker her eyes around the room.  Everyone looked just as confused as she was.  What would happen to the player she selected?  &quot;I choose... Caleb!&quot;  She leaned across the couch and elbowed him.  &quot;Thanks pal, I appreciate your generosi--&quot; She suddenly trailed, off, eyes going wide.  Caleb gave a start as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?!&quot; Caleb said, eyes glazing over.  His breath got shallow and his eyes became unfocused.  Jenna also seemed out of sorts, trying to regain her composure as she sat upright.<br />
<br />
Sarah opened her mouth to speak, but then clamped it shut in embarrassment as her eyes fell to Caleb&#39;s crotch.  She could see a bulge forming in his shorts as the boy&#39;s breath came in shallow gasps.  &quot;Derrick, is that you?!&quot; Sara said, looking across the table.  Derrick put his hands in the air to indicate his innocence, his eyes also fixed on his friend&#39;s erect member.  Courtney looked horrified at the sight.<br />
<br />
Then, to everyone&#39;s amazement, the bulge in Caleb&#39;s shorts began to dwindle.  Caleb looked down, confused.  &quot;W-what the hell?  No!&quot;  He cried.  Forgetting himself, he leapt to his feet and pulled the elastic of his shorts forward to give himself a view.  Everyone&#39;s eyes went wide as they saw that he was wearing a jockstrap.  The thick pouch was stretched to the max around his legendary member, and Sara saw that the rumors were true - he was hung like a horse!<br />
<br />
...Or was he?  As everyone looked on, they saw the jockstrap slacken bit by bit.  He was still rock hard, but his member was losing girth by the second.  &quot;Nooo,&quot; he whimpered, watching his manhood disappear.  &quot;Y-you can&#39;t!&quot;  Yet it continued to shrink away, looking more like the the bulge of a middle schooler, then a grade schooler.  Before long, the pouch of the jockstrap hung loosely around his crotch.  He pulled the waistband forward to look down, and almost fainted.  Instead of his proud manhood, he was rewarded with a view of a feminine mound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no,&quot; came a panicked voice.  But it wasn&#39;t Caleb&#39;s.  Everyone&#39;s eyes shot to Jenna, sitting cross-legged next to the newly feminized Caleb.  Her gaze was fixed on the crotch of her athletic shorts, which looked unnaturally tight.  It soon became obvious what &quot;luggage&quot; she had stolen from Caleb.  The fabric of her shorts strained and bulged outward as Caleb&#39;s renowned package transferred into her ownership.  She could feel her panties filling up with the foreign object, straining to contain her burgeoning testicles and shaft.  Caleb looked on helplessly as the bulge went from the size of a lime to the size of a lemon, then an orange.  Soon a cucumber-sized protrusion slid outward from her crotch, snaking along her inner thigh.  A mere inch more, and the tip would have poked out from the leg of her short shorts... but the growth mercifully stopped.  There stood Caleb, clutching an empty jockstrap, standing over Jenna, who now sported the biggest dick in the room, barely contained within her tight shorts and strained panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s... not fair...&quot; said Caleb, pathetically.  He could feel cool air seeping in the sides of his jockstrap and over his new anatomy.<br />
<br />
Jenna was panting, obviously overwhelmed with the new sensation.  She shifted her weight and felt her member slide along the inside of her thigh.  She moaned and a wet spot formed where the tip came to rest.  &quot;Whoa,&quot; she said softly, &quot;this thing is ready to explode.&quot;  She gingerly reached a hand down her shorts and tried to bundle everything together, afraid that if she sat the wrong way, she&#39;d spill out of her shorts completely.  Her cotton panties were useless at trying to contain her new equipment, so she tried her best before looking over at Caleb.  &quot;Hey, would you mind if I borrowed that?&quot;  She said, nodding at his dangling jockstrap.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... what?&quot; He said, obviously in shock.  Jenna got to her feet, feeling the weight of her crotch hanging down between her legs.  &quot;Come with me,&quot; she said, grabbing his hand and whisking him out of the room, &quot;We&#39;ve got some rearranging to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, the two emerged from down the hallway.  Jenna looked remarkably at ease, given the circumstances.  She waltzed in and sat down on the couch as before.  The thick waistband of Caleb&#39;s jockstrap was visible above the waistband of her athletic shorts, and her enormous bulge couldn&#39;t be missed.  Her erection had gone down, however, and her new undergarment bundled everything up nicely.<br />
<br />
Caleb was another story.  He looked nervous, and opted out of the couch, sitting instead on the floor near Courtney.  Derrick wondered if he had put on Jenna&#39;s panties, but decided not to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s it gonna be?&quot; said Jenna cheerily, looking from Sara to Caleb.</p>
