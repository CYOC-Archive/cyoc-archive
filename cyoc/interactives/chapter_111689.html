<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You found yourself in some nice fluffy bed sheets and ontop of a soft mattress. You heard a young woman say &quot;That anesthetic should be wearing off soon I believe.&quot;<br />
<br />
A young man then said &quot;At this point she&#39;s been asleep for how long? A day and a half? Let&#39;s see at the Nativ age rate... Since that guy said she was five when he got her. She&#39;s 23?&quot; <br />
<br />
After a small smack the woman said &quot;Get that look off of your face your nut fucking her.&quot; <br />
<br />
the young man said &quot;but isn&#39;t that  how your supposed to keep them alive?&quot;<br />
<br />
the woman said &quot;We&#39;re having her to help test out how we&#39;re going to domesticate those other things. The Nativ can breed with nearly anything so it should only take a week or two before her body is entirely similar to those things.&quot; <br />
<br />
groggily lifting your heavier body up  you were able to see the twins. their faces looked similar with their sapphire eyes however the guy definitely was taller by at least a foot and wore a black suit where his sister wore a nice blue dress. The guy&#39;s blond hair was trimmed with no hairs sticking out while the girl&#39;s longer hair looked like it was brushed a few hundred times each day. You muttered &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman&#39;s sapphire eyes started looked at you cold and said &quot;Just thinking about what we&#39;re going to do with you. You&#39;ve slept through your entire childhood, suppose it&#39;s a good thing you were left with your magic clothing.&quot; You looked down at your torso and was greeted with the sight of two voluptuous breasts that you were confused about and cupped them in your hands and giggled them around. You noted how sensitive they were but didn&#39;t notice your nipples start to harden and tent your clothing a bit. <br />
<br />
The man closed his eyes with a smirk on his face and said &quot;Well she definitely has a nice body.&quot; He then looked at his sister who looked exacerbated and shrugged. The woman left the room and then the guy came closer to you.  and then hopped onto the bed. Closer up you could smell the man&#39;s intoxicating cologne and see more details of his face. A little stubble on his chin, a little twinkle in his eye, and something that was making your nether regions start feeling a little warm. Taking off his suit the man said &quot;So miss do you have a name?&quot;<br />
<br />
A little nervous and feeling warm in the face you said &quot;V-val...&quot;<br />
<br />
The man said &quot;Well my name&#39;s Leandro, and i&#39;m going to show you a good time.&quot; He was in his underwear then pulled off the bedsheets inviting some cold air to come ontop of you. leandro then said &quot;Oh my little miss, if your so cold let me warm you up. Just let me get you out of that dress. After a little bit of fiddling your dress came off and then Leandro took off his underwear showing off a somewhat large rod of meat. Probably out of instinct you felt like you wanted it inside of you. Then the two of you had a rather awkward sex, which ended relatively fast. After he came inside you all of the strange feelings you&#39;ve been having just vanished, and you had a weird feeling as if something was sealing up. Looking at your body you saw that your vagina had vanished. You went to your dress and put it back on and Leandro asked &quot;Oh baby, don&#39;t you want a second round?&quot; <br />
<br />
You responded &quot;I&#39;m not sure what you did to me, but it&#39;s seemed to have vanished.&quot; You opened the door back up.<br />
<br />
Leandro said &quot;Aw come on Val, don&#39;t be such a tease.&quot; Outside the door you saw leandro&#39;s sister waiting a few feet away. <br />
<br />
The woman called out &quot;That was about as fast as I had expected. Looks like you didn&#39;t do as much research into the nativ as I have.&quot; <br />
<br />
Leandro yelled out &quot;The Heck Do You Mean Ashlynn?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashlynn sighed and said &quot;When Female the instant they get viable sperm in them their vaginas seal up and all sexual interest ends. An hour and a half latter they give birth in their special way of their adult bodies vanishing leaving their child on the ground where they stood. As Males once they climax they vanish their entire selves into the woman who then gives birth an Hour and a half afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
You said &quot;You were saying about making me breed with something. What were they?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ashlynn said &quot;Oh don&#39;t worry about that. We&#39;ll just show you around our house that you&#39;ll need to know about.&quot; She took your hand and started guiding you not waiting for her brother to catch up she showed you around. In the middle of showing you the kitchen her brother caught up in his suit apparently a little calm. As the tour of the giant house continued your belly got larger and larger along with your breasts as your breasts felt like they were being filled with some liquid. When you felt like you couldn&#39;t walk with the burden Leandro picked you up. The womanizer may have been less than a gentlemen at times but he was strong. At the time the tour ended almost an hour and a half had passed and you started feeling weird. You started breathing deeply and felt as if your body was getting lighter. Looking at your hand it seemed as if it was getting more transparent. Your vision blurred for a few seconds and when it returned Leandro was staring at you and he seemed to be a bit farther away. <br />
<br />
He looked around your nether region and then said &quot;So now i&#39;m the father of a little-&quot;</p>
