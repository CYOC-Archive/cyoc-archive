<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She was wearing Simon&#39;s mother&#39;s evening dress. Simon commented that Heather almost gave him a heart attack as she thought her mother just arrived earlier to the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is that so?&quot; Heather giggled.<br />
<br />
What Heather didn&#39;t tell the boys was that she had gained maybe a bit much knowledge compared to the small children there. To her Simon and Ed were too young to be friends anymore. So she just smiled and acted as if she was still their friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. This reminds me boys we should make me your foster mom and make Simon your parents temporarily live elsewhere.&quot; Heather suggested as she tapped her hands together. &quot;This way we don&#39;t have to stres- I mean worry about adults ruining our fun and we can at anytime change them back. How does that sound.&quot;<br />
<br />
With beaming starry eyes Simon was really up for this interesting idea. To him maybe it was a good idea to make Heather older as adults are more creative and smarter than kids. So in a bowing motion Simon let Heather to do anything with the Chronovac as she wished for. Ed felt a weird feeling in her chest as Heather didn&#39;t mention his parents and before he could ask Heather was rambling about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;So first, I need to make you 10-years-old.&quot; Heather explained.<br />
<br />
Simon cogged his head and asked why.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. As I am your adult I need to be older than you. Ed&#39;s age is still good as if you think about it I could make myself eighteen plus seven years old so I could be his parents. That would mean that I had to age myself even older.&quot; Heather rambled with her hands. &quot;So, if I wanted to be your parent I need you two to count how old I should make you if I wanted to be...&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon stopped her and said: &quot;Heather, just do it. That&#39;s word salad for me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather begun to change her age to more &#39;appropriate&#39; age for parenthood and gave herself 5 more extra years to work with. Then without even talking about changes she made Ed stay 7-year-old and turned Simon into a 8-year-old. Lastly she made the changes that she owned the house and never had to pay rent or any necessary loans for it. <br />
<br />
With a press of an enter the whole computer begun to process the big changes and as she escorted Ed and Simon out of the room. She let out a devious smile as she felt her body getting older. She watched as Simon begun to shrink from 13-year-old to 8-year-old as slowly as she grew in age.<br />
<br />
Then she felt something. Heather&#39;s hips begun to expand bigger as was her breasts. For a 22-year-old Heather she could feel how big her breasts had become as she technically had given birth to two children in row. The 10-year-old Simon just looked in awe as heather looked more and more like her mother than the Heather she knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, is everything okay?&quot; Ed asked as she put his mouth in his lips.<br />
<br />
He accidentally called Heather her mom infront of her brother Simon. Which was normal...? Right? Heather let out a smile as she gave a big hug to Ed. Heather&#39;s more devious nature became more mellow as she was now 24-year-old and been living as single mom for 8-years with the two boys. In that same moment Simon&#39;s original&#39;s mother&#39;s dress couldn&#39;t hold the expanding balloons and let out one of them out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my! Mommy&#39;s dress is getting out of control...&quot; Heather laughed. &quot;I need to go change quickly before I show too much skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon, now 8-years-old and Ed the 7-year-old was left in the living together as they looked their mom going upstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brother. Is it me or am I forgetting something serious. Didn&#39;t we... like... play a game in the computer room and something was supposed to happen?&quot; Ed asked as his now brother Simon was opening television.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What? What game?&quot; Simon asked back as he had already forgotten.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind...&quot; Ed replied and sat next to his brother.<br />
<br />
On top of the stairs Heather heard the conversation and was static that both of them had forgotten everything like children. Inside the new &#39;Heather only&#39; bedroom she browsed what kind of clothes did Simon&#39;s ex-mother own. She let out sigh as all the bras, shirts and dresses couldn&#39;t hold her now melon sized tits. Her ass and tights were pretty bulky and only things she could wear was a short-sleeved blouse as a make-shift tank top and cotton trousers that would bite into her skin.<br />
<br />
&#39;I guess I gained a bit weight when I gave birth to them.&#39; Heather thought as she admired her new self in the mirror.<br />
<br />
She knew that those two wouldn&#39;t understand or appreciate how hard it was for a woman like her to look pretty. As a single mother living in a paid big house wasn&#39;t a small task and now that every piece of cloth were too small. She would have to drive to mall and get a bunch of new clothing...<br />
<br />
&#39;Wait a minute... How much money do I have?&#39; Heather panicked and begun to open drawers to find something, anything, to use as money. What she instead found was...</p>
