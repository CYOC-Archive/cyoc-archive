<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jessica and Alice get back to Alice's house they heard Alice's charge barking in the neighbors back yard. Alice and Jessica head over across the street and peek in through the wooden gate. As Alice stared dreamily at Tor, the German Shepherd that was running around the fenced in are chasing a small squirrel. Jessica pulled out her portable computer and plugged in the Chronivac's emitter.<br />
<br />
Jessica frowned lightly when she found that she didn't have any wifi signal, but smiled when the Chronivac program still worked without contact to the TranDem Lab servers. She brings up the chronivac's program and scanned Alice, bringing up her information. She clicked over to the transformation side of the page. She grins somewhat listening to Alice swoon over the dog that doesn't even know she's there. Jessica starts modifying things on the page. <br />

<br />
<br />
Jessica was grinning as she set the reproduction section to being in heat and set the instinct level to 60%. She knows Alice will be human in mind, but instinct will win out over rational thought in the end. She lined the emitter up with Alice who was still looking through the gate. The Chronivac's emitter lit up and shot it's beam at Alice. <br />
<br />
Alice began to whine, she was turned on by the dog, about to turn around and talk to Jessica about what they should do, but just before she did she caught the scent of Tor on the other side of the fence. Her spine had began growing longer, her new tail beginning to grow out from under her shirt and above her waistband. Her tail began growing, starting to wag side to side. Fur began sprouting all over the body. While she shrunk in some ways and grew in others, her clothes began to lose their fit. Pants falling down to her ankles as her backside, and pussy reshaped to that of a dog's. Her breasts shrank, being replaced by 8 teats along her belly. Her fingers grew shorter, nails turned black and grew longer as her thumb detached and drifted up on her forearms becoming dewclaws. Her feet shifted and changed shape, forcing her down onto all fours. Her ears drifted to the top of her head, muzzle pressed out. Teeth growing and changing, nose darkened and flattened until she appeared as a simple dog. <br />
<br />
Jessica smiled and set down the pocket computer as she watched Alice's shirt and clothes pull up around the new dog, turning into a collar and tags around Alice's neck. Alice's pants had turned into a leash. Jessica giggled watching Alice scratch at the gate and whine, wanting into the back yard with Tor. Her tail was wagging a mile a minute wafting her heat scent around which quickly got Tor's attention. He ran over to the gate, sniffing at the new bitch from the other side. <br />
<br />
Jessica reached over to gate latch and opened the gate slowly to not let Tor out, but Alice was fast to get into the back yard. The two dogs began sniffing at each other, Alice was sniffing under Tor and Tor was sniffing up under her tail. Tor began licking against her puffy warm vulva almost instantly. Jessica giggled, &quot;You're such a perv Alice.&quot; But Alice didn't care, her tail was wagging, she wanted to be this dog's bitch but now that she was a dog, she was. A part of her wanted to have his puppies, but the smaller part, the human part didn't. She let out a small whine as Tor was beginning to erect.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac was still working though, beginning to heat up and actually smoke as it worked towards the reality change. The process was draining the pocket computer's battery life and overloading the emitter. The emitter reached it's full charge and suddenly pops. It blows out it's circuitry as it released it's final wave to adjust reality. When the emitter blew out the emitter sent back a power surge into the computer. The computer suddenly shut off to protect itself from being fried, however in doing so it didn't save, and lost Alice's data. <br />
<br />
Alice moved around Tor, he followed her intently. lapping and licking at her sweet smelling vulva, pulling his own instincts out. She finally stopped and presented herself to the male. He didn't waste any time at all when she lifted her tail up and to the side. He leaped up onto Alice's back, his forepaws wrapping around the bitch's waist, paws hooking up under her flanks. His dewclaws dig in at her, making her whine. She shifts herself from side to side as Tor began thrusting forward at her backside. <br />
<br />
Tor found his mark almost instantly and stepped forward, driving himself fully into his new bitch. He rests his muzzle down between Alice's shoulder blades as she braces for him. His haunches begin rolling rolling, his sheath mashing against he vulva time and time again. His sheath being pressed back further, little by little. It wasn't but a couple minutes before his knot was beginning to swell. He makes it a point to keep his knot inside the bitch, not pulling back far enough to pull it back out of her. His pre drooling and spurting into Alice as he mates with her. His pre doing several things in actuality, helping lube her channel, but more importantly it was coating he cervix and covering her natural spermicides inside the female body.<br />
<br />
Alice whined, lowering her head slightly, ears folded back as she felt Tor stretching her open. She pants softly, twitching her tail, actually pressing back against him to brace against his thrusts. She whines and yelps, shivering under the male. His actions sending sparks through her, her walls clenching and tugging on his length. She lets out another yelp when she feels his knot beginning to stretch her channel. A war going on in her mind. She barks a few times, &quot;Don't let him tie me! I don't want his puppies! I only wanted to be his bitch!&quot; She barks, but Jessica being human still doesn't understand the barks coming from Alice. Alice squirmed under the male as his knot kept swelling and suddenly she lets out a howl as her walls spasm and pull, squeeze on his cock as she reaches her first canine climax. <br />
<br />
Tor though feels her resistance and suddenly snaps and bites onto her scruff, growling softly in warning. The message was quite clear to her though as she whined and panted below him. His knot fully tied into the bitch a moment later. His haunches kept pressing into her in short pumps. His tip pressed against her cervix the knot pulling back on her channel enough to dilate that last bastion between his red member and her fertile fields. His howl joined hers moments later as his sperm and seed was splashed up into his new bitch. His seed finding it's way past her cervix and into her uterus. His length twitching lightly, splashing his puppy batter up into her. Hundreds of billions of sperm seeking out Alice's released eggs to give her a nice big litter. <br />
<br />
Tor slide off her back and turned, lifting a hind leg up and over Alice to stand tail to tail. He stood there with her held by his knot, both dogs panting. Alice whimpering lightly feeling Tor still releasing inside of her. Though the torrent gad washed past his member was still drooling into her, forcing his cum into her further and further into her.<br />
<br />
As they stood there tail to tail for almost half an hour, one after another Alice's eggs were fertilized. All in all Alice's ovaries had released 12 eggs. As Tor pulled on his knot and popped out of Alice's vulva, her first egg was fertilized, followed by 9 others. After Tor had pulled out Alice sat down on her haunches and rolled onto a hip to lean down and begin licking at herself to clean herself of Tor's drool, cum and her own fluids. Inside the dog's mind Alice was slightly disgusted at what she was doing, the dog's instincts were in full control and her human mind was unable to resist them.<br />
<br />
Jessica by that point had put her pocket computer back in her pocket, not knowing the damage it's caused. She noticed that it's screen was off, and just figured that it was in sleep mode, there was no visual damage to the emitter to tip her off to what had happened. Almost 2 hours after they arrived Jessica opened the gate and pulled Alice back out, clipping the leash onto her collar, &quot;Common Alice, time to go home you can come back and see him again tomorrow.&quot; She closed the gate and locked it. <br />
<br />
With the Reality change, Jessica had become the dog sitter for Tor, there was a contract between Tor's owners and Jessica now that she was dog sitting for the week, for a week of Stud Service to be provided by Tor. She still had 5 more days to go!</p>
