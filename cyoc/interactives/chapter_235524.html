<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the former men now a bunch of preteen kids, there wasn&#39;t much they could do until Dr. ClownGoggles, Doc for short, can figure out what&#39;s up with his device and how long it&#39;ll be until they can change back, so they stood around in their oversized clothing chatting about what to do next while Doc fiddled with his invention. Having been various ages and differing muscular body types all reduced to the same age, they found they all had more in common than they thought.<br />
<br />
The first boy, Dylan, began to speak. He was a black haired kid who was formerly a twenty seven year old man who had had experience in Olympic training. Now he&#39;s a kid who looks like he just started figuring out what weights were. &quot;Man, this stinks. Now how am I gonna compete in the next big event? Come next year, I&#39;ll be just starting puberty!&quot; He seemed downtrodden.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about it, man! We&#39;ll be back to normal before a year passes, I&#39;m sure.&quot; The next boy, Mike, or rather Mikey now, patted Dylan on the back. He used to be a brown haired guy closing in on thirty seven years old, with a strong and bulky build, but definitely more natural looking since he only really worked out when he had time for it raising a family. Now, the guy was young enough to be his own kid&#39;s little brother! He treated the group the same way since everyone but Bryce was younger than him. <br />
<br />
Bryce was the third member, and formerly a burly forty year old with huge muscles and a firm gut, giving him that bearish figure with red hair all over his body. Now he was just a middle schooler with no hair anywhere except his head and a bit of meat on his bones, though a lot of it was still baby fat. &quot;Easy for you to say. Look at me. My muscles are gone! Though...I do like being a kid again. It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve felt this charged with energy, heheh!&quot; Bryce flexed what little muscle he still had left, which wasn&#39;t a lot under the youthful chubbiness that had returned to him.<br />
<br />
The fourth boy, Tom, was the youngest in the group, being a blonde college aged hunk of twenty one years. His muscles were big and strong for his age, having had consistent training as a hobby since he was in middle school. He&#39;d bonded with the others over gym training and found that he really liked hanging out with them despite them being so much older than him. Though, being bi, every now and then he&#39;d admire how strong and manly everyone was. It was hard not to when you&#39;re surrounded by muscular dudes. But now that they were all the same age, the boy having been tossed backward through teenhood once more, he didn&#39;t feel nuch of anything, at least nothing sexual. &quot;I hope we&#39;re not stuck like this, bro...I don&#39;t wanna be a kid again. Not when I just finished being one.&quot; Tom, or rather Tommy, looked down at his scrawny body in the tank top that covered him like a dress down to his thighs now, hiding how small his once large cock had become. His jockstrap and shorts were on the floor around him as he felt the lightly toned muscles he still had from being at the starting line of puberty. His body had just started to mature at this age, so he was beginning a growth spurt and his baby fat was dissipating across his lanky body. Looking at a nearby mirror in the locker room, he saw his cute, rounded face with a slight definition in his jaw and blushed, looking away in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Mikey put his arm around him. &quot;Aww, it&#39;ll be alright, Tommy.&quot; He moved his hand down to his shoulder blades, rubbing his back like a dad would. It made Tommy feel warm and fuzzy, but he was fighting with his young adult pride, making him flustered at being treated like a kid even though he was one right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we can hang out and do other stuff while we wait for this to wear off.&quot; Bryce said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But where can we go? We can&#39;t go out in just giant shirts. The police&#39;ll be on our ass.&quot; Dylan asked. The doc chimed in. &quot;Now now, language, my boy! I have the perfect remedy for your wardrobe malfunction. And this one&#39;s been tested!&quot; He took out a different device, though it was more like a silly looking computer. &quot;I call it, the Dress Up Device, or the DUD, for short.&quot; Tommy giggled. &quot;Man, what a great name.&quot; Doc smiled. &quot;It&#39;s as silly as my trousers! Which you can have too with one click of this colorful computer! Just input your settings and voila!&quot; Doc clicked &#39;recommended&#39; on all four of them to save time and hit enter. Waves of light dispersed out, shooting through them and shrinking their workout gear into more childish versions of their t-shirts, tanks and shorts into clothing fit for their age, the more adult type clothing like Tommy’s jockstrap converting into briefs. &quot;Wow! Cool!&quot; Tommy couldn&#39;t help but be amazed, as did the rest of them. But him in particular felt especially excited, as if his mind had started becoming more childish and cheerful like the rest of him,  losing that teen attitude.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s not all, it can do the opposite! So if you boys return to your former ages, you&#39;ll have fitting clothes in no time. This was patented by yours truly years ago, though not many stores carry it. A ClownGoggles original!&quot; The doctor boasted with gusto. &quot;Now then, I&#39;ll be just another moment. Go on and keep yourselves busy while I study what&#39;s wrong with my YoYo Ray. Run along, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Doc continued his analysis, the boys made their plans to go exercise, but with a lot less weight than before. It was a struggle now since each of them were so much smaller and weaker being so young, but watching someone like Bryce have trouble lifting a dumbell when he could lift a barbell no problem as an adult was too funny for the others. &quot;Hnngh, hey, quit laughing! I can still, ungh...lift a hefty amount for a kid my age, ugh...&quot; Bryce grunted as he pushed hard to do the weights in each hand.<br />
<br />
After a while, each of them returned to the locker room, sweating despite them not doing nearly as much as before. Though, at least it was mostly just from their head with barely if any smells going on. &quot;Man, that was hard...&quot; Dylan commented. &quot;Yeah, I feel like I just ran a marathon, but I only did a speedy treadmill run!&quot; Mikey added. &quot;Mmmgh, I feel like I could barely lift more than my big bro, now. I-I mean, little bro!&quot; Tommy caught himself thinking of himself as his thirteen year old brother&#39;s little sibling for a moment. Mikey looked at him with worry in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aha! Eureka!&quot; Doc found the settings inside the YoYo Ray, where the stats and time set could be read. &quot;Boys, I&#39;ve figured out how long it&#39;ll be before the effects wear off! Though, you might want to sit down for this one.&quot; He explained.<br />
<br />
Gathering around, the group listened intently to the doctor&#39;s explanation. &quot;Now, the experiment was certainly a success. But, we still need to see if the yo can you back up, you know! So, I dug into the inner parts of the device and found the notes I hid in a compartment.&quot; Doc pulled out the paper he stored in the handle of the gun. &quot;The schematics of this invention state that the ray&#39;s effects should resolve in...&quot;</p>
