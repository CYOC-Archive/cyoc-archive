<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, now that that excitement is over, let&#39;s get back to the matters at hand.&quot; Frances said. She was standing a ways away from the doorway, a little stunned from the display. She didn&#39;t know much about Alyssa, but it was clear that the girl was determined to get what she wanted. And she obviously wanted Melissa.<br />
<br />
“Sorry about that Frances. But at least that looks like the last time we’ll see her for a while.” Martin said with a heavy heart. He knew Alyssa. She was persistent, stubborn, and most of all, a honeytrap. If there was someone she wanted, man or woman, she’d find a way to get them in her clutches. <br />
<br />
“It’s alright. That’s what I’m here for. Dealing with problems. And Alyssa Cooper is one of them. On that note, what else can you tell me about her? How exactly does she know you Martin?” Frances asked. <br />
<br />
Martin hesitated to answer, as he still hadn’t told his wife the truth about his relationship with Alyssa. They hadn’t just been in a relationship back during his college years. He’d been the one who changed her, and therefore Martin held an important place in Alyssa’s heart. <br />
<br />
“Martin?” Melissa looked at her husband quizzically. She couldn’t understand why he was pausing. Julie, who had remained dutifully silent up until now also gave her father a look. Martin sighed and asked Melissa not to get mad at him if he told her the truth. <br />
<br />
“Depends.” Melissa grumbled, wondering is Martin had actually cheated on her with Alyssa during the course of their marriage. <br />
<br />
“I’ve known Alyssa since we were in college. She was an out of town transfer to the school. She came up here because she already had family in the area, Douglas’ family. And once she found out about weres, there was only one kind she ever considered becoming. Douglas contacted me, said his cousin was interested in becoming an mer, and well you know the rest.” Martin hung his head in shame. <br />
<br />
“And?” Melissa pressed. <br />
<br />
“And? And what? That’s it. Ever since Alyssa’s had this unhealthy obsession with me. I swear, I only ever saw her during her time at school. Then she went back to California, and I met you. I didn’t hear from her until a couple of weeks ago. I knew the minute she contacted me she wasn’t interested in just ‘catching up’. Alyssa’s never been that kind of girl.” Martin said. <br />
<br />
“That’s a relief.” Melissa thought. Yes she was mad at Martin for not telling her the whole truth. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, she was glad Martin had at least told the truth about his relations, or lack thereof, with Alyssa during their marriage. Of course there was still the matter of the dozen or so other blonde bimbos she’d caught him with. <br />
<br />
“Why don’t you just do it and get it over with?” Julie asked, speaking for the first time since she came downstairs. <br />
<br />
“What?” Both her parents gaped at her. <br />
<br />
“Well, if all she wants is a good time, just give it to her. Then she’s happy and she’ll leave you alone. What’s the big deal? Its not like she’s asking for one of you to give a kidney or something? It’s just sex.” Julie said impassively. <br />
<br />
“Do you really think that Julie?” Frances asked. <br />
<br />
“It’s just physical, it doesn’t mean anything. Mom and Dad love each other. And Alyssa made it fairly clear she’s not interested in any sort of relationship. She just wants some fun.” Julie shrugged. <br />
<br />
“Julie…” Martin was about to tell his daughter off, but Frances intervened. <br />
<br />
“Is that why you cheated on Eric? You wanted to have fun and since he’s normal…”<br />
<br />
He said he loved me, but he wouldn’t make the change.” Julie huffed. <br />
<br />
“That doesn’t mean it’s alright to sleep with someone else.” Melissa said. She glanced at Martin, who did nod in agreement, but knew he was as guilty as his daughter. <br />
<br />
“Isn’t it? Would you rather I have just thrown him into the pool and fucked his brains out? Then what? He’d hate me forever.”<br />
<br />
“He already hates you! And you already tried to turn him against his will!” Melissa felt her blood pressure rising. <br />
<br />
“Alright, I think we need to take a moment to…” Frances tried to calm the mother and daughter, but the damage was done. Julie jumped up from her seat and started mouthing off. <br />
<br />
“Because he ruined everything! He wasn’t supposed to start seeing someone else! He was supposed to come back! He wasn’t supposed to leave me!! He told me he’d become a were for ME!” Julie shouted. <br />
<br />
“And you said you understood why he wanted to wait. Was that just to get him in bed?” Martin asked cooly. <br />
<br />
“I… I loved him…” Julie whispered. She sunk back into her chair, on the verge of tears. Martin and Melissa were shocked to hear Julie admit her feelings for Eric. Frances as well. She made a note to talk to Eric about his time with Julie. Though he had since moved on and found his life mate, was it possible Julie still thought of him as hers? <br />
<br />
“Because of her parents’ relationship, she doesn’t see anything wrong with her cheating. Julie likes manipulating things to get her way, like a certain someone else I suspect. So Eric being an outsider, a normal teenage boy from out of town, would have seemed the perfect candidate for Julie to mold how she liked. Obviously things didn’t go as she planned.” Frances jotted down notes and made a few mental ones at the same time. <br />
<br />
She had about a million questions to ask, unsure where to start. Julie was pouting in her chair, showing real emotion for the first time in weeks. No crocodile tears, she looked genuinely hurt that Eric hadn’t broken up with her.</p>
