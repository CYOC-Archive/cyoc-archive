<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The four young women continued to talk as they ate breakfast. After much debate the girls decided that a trip to the mall would probably be the best option for the group. The mall would provide the best opportunity for everyone with the older girls being able to shop while the young ones could see a movie. The girls continued to talk excitedly as Mary and Mika entered the room. Mary smiled as she walked towards the coffee pot while Mika grumbled and slumped into a chair. The young Asian woman proceeded to lay her head on the table and groan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,&quot; Mika moaned. &quot;Need....coffee.....now.&quot; &quot;How you sleep Mika,&quot; Claudia asked. Mika glared at Claudia with bloodshot eyes before mumbling an answer and laying her head down on the table. &quot;Hey Mika,&quot; Mary Elise said excitedly. &quot;Look Tricia&#39;s back.&quot; Mika looked up and the young black teen before answering. &quot;Hey Tricia how come your still a kid?&quot; &quot;Good to see you too Mika,&quot; Tricia grumbled.<br />
<br />
Mary turned to the young teen with a concerned look on her face. &quot;Sorry about that,&quot; she said. &quot;She&#39;s got a wicked hangover but she does have a point. How come your not any older?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what Katie told me the ring is keeping me younger than the rest of you until I earn it&#39;s trust back,&quot; Trica sighed. &quot;Hopefully by the end of the weekend I can turn back to normal. At least I&#39;m not seven anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how as it last night,&quot; Sammy asked. &quot;What do you remember from being seven on Halloween?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia thought about everything that happened last night. &quot;It&#39;s weird,&quot; she said. &quot;I remember trick or treating last night but sitting here like this it feels like a distant memory. It&#39;s a good memory but it feels like it happened years ago. I&#39;m just surprised that I didn&#39;t remember being an adult at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other girls looked on with interest while Mika continued to groan. &quot;I don&#39;t mean to be rude Tricia,&quot; Mika groaned. &quot;But can we keep the noise down my head is killing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Mika I might be able to help,&quot; Katie said. &quot;I could make you younger and eliminate the alcohol from your system.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika looked up  Katie with a suspicious look on her face. &quot;How much younger?&quot; She asked. &quot;Only a year or two,&quot; Katie said. Mika weighed her options battle a hangover the rest of the morning or become 19 and feel better. &quot;Okay Katie,&quot; Mika sighed. &quot;Let&#39;s do it. Just don&#39;t make me too young I don&#39;t want to end up back in high school. No offense Tricia. &quot;None taken,&quot; she replied curtly. Katie looked down at her ring and made her wish.<br />
<br />
Mika quickly began regressing going from 21 to 20 and finally 19. Mika lifted her head off the table and rubbed her eyes. &quot;How you feel,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;Amazing,&quot; Mika said. &quot;It&#39;s almost like I didn&#39;t drink at all last night.&quot; Mika now stood up and examined herself in the hallway mirror. While her curves had been reduced slightly Mika was thankful the changes were subtle. Her breasts were still perky b cups and her legs were still shapely. Unfortunately her face appeared a little younger meaning their would be no chance f her being able to convince anyone she was old enough to drink. &quot;I&#39;d probably get carded for cigarettes,&quot; she thought as she examined her body. Shrugging Mika turned to the others with a smile on her face. &quot;So when are we leaving,&quot; she asked cheerfully. &quot;I&#39;m ready to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well let&#39;s get dressed and then we can be on our way,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;Mary why don&#39;t you get Jake up while we get the kids dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Katie,&quot; Tricia said. &quot;I want to ask a favor.&quot; Katie looked at the young teen. &quot;What is Tricia,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Tricia looked out at the three seven year olds happily watching t.v. before turning to Katie. &quot;I was hoping you could make Karen 15 as well,&quot; she said. &quot;I know that she was your teacher and you and the others aren&#39;t her biggest fans but she is a nice girl. Last night me and her became really close and hopefully spending more time with her might change her when we grow back up. Besides this way I&#39;ll have someone my age to hang out with instead of being a tag along with the rest of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie thought about Tricia&#39;s request for a moment, her request made sense. The young teen would feel left out with Katie and her friends being too old while Kellie and Judy were too young. Someone her age would allow Tricia to enjoy her day at the mall like everyone else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Tricia I&#39;ll do it,&quot; Katie replied. &quot;Why don&#39;t you call her in.&quot; Tricia smiled and called Karen into the kitchen. The shy dark haired seven year old crept into the kitchen trying to avoid eye contact with Katie. &quot;Is something wrong,&quot; Karen asked as she pushed her large glasses back up her nose. Katie grinned as she made a wish for Karen to become 15 in mind and body.<br />
<br />
Karen felt a tingle as she began to grow back up. Karens body shot up in height as she became ten. The young girl had a look of confusion as she looked at the older girls in front of her. Karens breasts began to develop as she became 11 and then 12. The girl was still ver shy as she crossed her arms over her developing chest. As Karen once again entered her teens her body continued to swell towards maturity as her hips flared and her breasts continued to grow. Karen pushed her glasses up her nose again and looked at Tricia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Karen,&quot;Tricia said. &quot;I was thinking about going to the mall today. You want to hang out with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karens heart skipped a beat as she became 14. No one had ever asked her to hang out before, let alone an older girl who in her mind was very popular. Karen shook her head as she became 15. Now the two girls were the same age and in the same class. Karen scuffed her barefoot on the kitchen floor as she looked down at her skinny legs. &quot;Are you sure,&quot; she asked meekly. &quot;I mean it&#39;s just that I didn&#39;t think you would want to hang out with me seeing that your sister and her friends wanted to take you to the mall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia was puzzled by Karens comments as she looked to Katie who shrugged. &quot;My sister,&quot; she asked. Karen pushed her glasses up her nose and brushed her hair out of her face. &quot;Yeah Mika and Claudia,&quot;Karen said shyly. &quot;They were going to take you to the mall with their friends to hang out. I didn&#39;t think you would want to hang out with me anymore now that they were here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia smiled sweetly and placed her hand on the girls shoulder. &quot;Of course I want to hang out with you,&quot; Tricia said happily. &quot;Now why don&#39;t we have some vreakfast and get dressed. We&#39;re probably going to leave in an hour.&quot; Karen smiled happily as she sat down and began to eat.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as she watched the two teens talk. Hopefully the day would go well as the group prepared for a day of shopping and fun.</p>
