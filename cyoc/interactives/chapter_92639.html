<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex didnt know why but he began to cry. He didn&#39;t even know what sentence the chronivac would translate this into. Maybe it was because justice was going to be served? Maybe it was because he was probably going to loose his mom, who, despite everything, he still loved. Part of him wished that they came back with 0% so they could just move on with their lives, part of him wished they had come back with 100% so she would feel exactly how awful it felt to be completely out of control of your own body like poor Miranda.<br />
<br />
The Judge addressed Alex&#39;s mom directly, initially your actions were justified but the longer this went on, the more people you hurt. Your actions, though initially out of love, became twisted by self interest and you were blinded by power. Thankfully you were stopped when you were, if you had gotten around to that orgy you were planning I doubt the verdict would have stayed under 90%. <br />
<br />
His mom was crying now, nodding her head in acceptance.<br />
<br />
With this I have no choice but to accept the verdict and allow sentencing to commence... The judge raised his gavel.<br />
<br />
&quot;WAIT!&quot;, Alex screamed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now son, we came to this verdict fair and square, and its only right that these people get the justice they deserve.&quot; the judge said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and you are right&quot;, Alex said. &quot;But she is still my mother, and this is probably the last time I will ever get to see her as such. I want to say good bye before&quot; Alex glanced over at the chronivac and they all understood. Everyone else was going back to their lives like nothing happened, he was losing a parent as a teenager. Even his fathers loss wouldn&#39;t be so great. The judge nodded and Alex ran over to and hugged his mother for a long minute.<br />
<br />
Though hot tears he said, &quot;I am SO angry with you. You hurt me, and all these people, and I love you. I set up this trial because I wanted it to be RIGHT. I was so angry that I wouldn&#39;t be fair, and I KNEW that. All throughout the trial your main defense was to make me to look like a foolish child who you had to protect from himself. You were horribly selfish and I am very disappointed in you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex walked back to the seat next to his father and sat down. The judge, jury, witnesses, and Alex&#39;s mother sat in stunned silence. It hadn&#39;t crossed any of their minds how this process had come to be, they all assumed the chronivac program itself had done it.<br />
<br />
Alex realized that everyone was silent and staring at him, a boy of 15, herald of justice. &quot;Oh, thank you for that opportunity your honor, you may proceed.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Judge looked at Alex and laughed, &quot;You are full of surprises, aren&#39;t you? You know, based on the character and conviction you have just shown, you did invalidate most of your mothers defense, I can, based on this new information, raise the verdict to 75%. By foregoing vengence and being both the victim and the one with the most to loose in the form of collateral damage. I think you should have a direct say in this. Would you like me to do that son?&quot; <br />
<br />
Alex was taken aback, he didnt expect this. &quot;To be honest your honor, my mom was probably right to doubt me when this all started. She did MAKE me grow as a person and though she did it the wrong way, it worked for me. Not so much for some of the others. If I have a say, I would ask that the court consider lowering by 10 percent instead of raising it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well son.&quot; The judge looked at the jury of women who were swayed by his heartfelt righteousness and were nodding their heads in affirmation. <br />
<br />
&quot;So it will be. Not Malicious, 55% heinous.&quot; With that he slammed his gavel down and the chronivac whirled into action Scanning everyone&#39;s mind determining the most appropriate sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sentence determined: Golden retriever puppy, subject 23% aware, world 0% aware. Owner: Alex&quot;<br />
<br />
Terror swept across his mothers face for a brief second as the changes began. First golden fur burst out of her, next her clothes shimmered out of existience as she crumpled to the floor.<br />
<br />
She began to dwindle in size as a tail grew out of her backside. The entire room watched, frozen as the sentence was carried out. All except Alex who rushed to his mother&#39;s side. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! Mom! Are you okay?&quot; Alex screamed in a panic. <br />
<br />
Her face pushed out to a muzzle, her nose turned black as her face reshaped. Her bones and muscle disintegrated and reformed into its new canine shape and she continued shrinking. <br />
<br />
Alex held her in a hug, pulling her shrinking body onto his lap. A few of the jurors excused themselves, not caring and wanting to get back to their lives, as did many of the onlookers. As they stepped out of the courtroom they were immediately teleported back to their lives as though nothing had happened.<br />
<br />
Two feet long now and still shrinking, fully fitting in Alex&#39;s lap. Alex was crying and kept repeating, &quot;It didn&#39;t have to be this way mom, it didn&#39;t, it didn&#39;t have to be this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of the transformation took place and the chronivac beeped. &quot;Phase two, Mental Changes, paused, pending teleportation.&quot; The judge stood, and exited, teleporting as soon as his hand hit the doorknob. All remaining on lookers excluding the bailiff, and victims were teleported out.<br />
<br />
The nine year old boy exclaimed, &quot;Wow, is that how puppies are made?&quot; The mailman seeing that Justice was served, grabbed the kids hand and said, &quot;Lets go find your mommy, do you know what street you live on?&quot; The chronivac took care of it by teleporting each to their rightful place. The puppy wiggled out of Alex&#39;s lap and began to bark and play. The puppies youth apparently overwhelming the seriousness of the situation.<br />
<br />
Alex looked up and saw his father, Miranda and Brad, his poolboy friend, standing over him. Alex didnt really want to talk or listen to anyone so he stood up and was heading for the door when the Chronivac chirped. &quot;After trial effects commencing... Allen...&quot; Alex walked over to the chronivac and saw the mailman&#39;s life was being straightened out. He will be especially appreciating the 100,000 dollar life insurance policy check he will be receiving.<br />
<br />
Alex smiled, at least his life is better for this. The Chronivac chirped. &quot;Allen completed, Bradley Commencing...&quot; Alex looked up and Brad moaned in pleasure as the changes began. He immediately began growing from his short stature to average height, maybe even the tall side of average? His stomach growled as his muscle tone, definition, and mass all increased making him look like he could be a player on the varsity baseball team, maybe track? &quot;Wow...&quot; he said, his voice an octave deeper than a moment ago, he stretched his neck and opened his mouth, popping his jaw which was rearranging. &quot;That felt amazing.&quot; he said shaking his head. Just then a heavy dusting of dense stubble grew in across his cheeks, jaw, and neck.<br />
<br />
Alex laughed, &quot;Wow indeed, nobody&#39;s going to mistake you for a thirteen year old ever again.&quot; <br />
<br />
The chronivac chirped, &quot;Mental changes pending teleportation, Brad complete. Miranda Commencing... Mental changes pending teleportation, Miranda complete. Press any key to teleport all or click X to close teleportation window.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec&#39;s dad had watched Brad&#39;s transformation and engaged him in conversation, &quot;Whats going on? Are you 21 now?&quot;<br />
&quot;Aww, I wish! Alex just barely let me get away with this! I&#39;m still just 15, but when I get back everyones going to remember me being an early bloomer, shaving by 12 I&#39;d guess&quot; Brad smiled and rubbed his face.<br />
<br />
While they were talking Miranda came up to Alex and started yelling at him that he was just as bad as his mother for having set up changes to her when she leaves.<br />
<br />
Alex remembered that the trauma of the experience regressed her and let her say her peace before showing her how he was protecting her from something she truly couldn&#39;t handle. Rather than understanding, she threw a tantrum and ran out the back door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Miranda mental changes complete, Miranda complete.&quot; The chronivac chirped. Alex opened her profile to see she had grown to the maturity of an average 17 year old from the experiences she gained looking at a different culture. He had done the right thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Brad&quot; Alex called looking at his friend, &quot;I&#39;d like to take a moment with my father if you dont mind. You are looking great, see you at school.&quot; Brad smiled at the compliment and went to the door, disappearing back to his new reality.<br />
<br />
His father walked over and took a seat, what&#39;s going on in that brain of yours son?</p>
