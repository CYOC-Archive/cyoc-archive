<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The three men got to work unpacking the rental truck Kyle had, which had mysteriously filled with heavy workout equipment, which confused Kyle for a moment. “You were going to unpack all this on your own?” Andy joked, knowing it only existed because of his earlier manipulations. “How about you sit back and let me and my bro handle this?”<br />
<br />
Kyle wanted to protest that he could move his own furniture, but at the same time he really, really wanted to see these hunky twins getting all sweaty. He nodded, feeling suddenly less assertive as his two neighbors got to work moving a weight bench up to his new apartment while he focused on his boxes and smaller furniture. As Kyle lifted more and more of his new furniture and possessions, he felt more and more at ease, as the memories and new reality that Andy had made for him settled in and became the truth.<br />
<br />
“Dude, you got some nice stuff here!” Jim commented as he hefted a weight set up onto his shoulders. “Between your stuff and ours, I hope the rest of the floor doesn’t whine about the whole building smelling like a gym!”<br />
<br />
“Hey, if they complain, maybe you and me will just have to do something about it?” Andy suggested, making Kyle wonder what that could possibly mean.<br />
<br />
Even though each man was packed with muscle, it still took them over an hour to get everything moved upstairs. As Kyle was unpacking a box of gym clothes in his bedroom, Andy walked in with a cardboard box and asked, “Hey, where do you want this one, Kyle?”<br />
<br />
“Over there on the bed, I guess,” Kyle said, not immediately recognizing the box. Andy gave it a light toss and it landed on the bed, spilling out its contents and making Kyle’s eyes go wide when he saw what was inside. Dildos of all sizes, big bottles of lube, restraints, blindfolds, you name it. Any kind of kinky toy a young man needed, Kyle had. He felt his face burning up, as his memories of being a average straight man and a muscular but subby gay man collided in his head.<br />
<br />
“T-t-those aren’t… I-I mean, I didn’t… I never…!” Kyle sputtered out, making Andy burst into laughter and pick up one of the biggest dildos on the bed.<br />
<br />
“No need to be embarrassed, dude,” Andy said with a smirk, making Kyle nearly melt on the spot. “I had a feeling you liked this sort of thing from how you were eyeing me and my bro’s asses back in our apartment.”<br />
<br />
Behind Andy, Jim appeared at the bedroom door, an identical grin on his face. “It’s a pretty big one, isn’t it?” Jim said looking at the dildo in his twin brother’s hand. “You use that one a lot, Kyle?”<br />
<br />
Despite being packed with muscles, Kyle was still as submissive as they came, so all he could do was blush and nod. “All the time…” he murmured, and a memory of the first time he’d ever fit the whole thing inside himself entered his mind. He’d been so proud of himself, but it still wasn’t enough.<br />
<br />
His two neighbors plopped down on either side of him, and Jim leaned in and said, “It’s a big toy, for sure. But you know what?”<br />
<br />
“We’re both bigger,” Andy responded, knowing exactly where his twin brother was going with this. The men both slowly slid their jeans and boxers down, letting their identical uncut cocks flop out onto their laps. Kyle couldn&#39;t stop himself from reaching out and taking one in each hand, loving how warm and moist and perfectly identical they felt in his hand. <br />
<br />
He felt a rush of new memories filling his head, memories of jacking off to twin-themed porn and fantasizing over losing his virginity to twins for as long as he could remember. He was still a virgin, since no matter how many chances he got to hook up, he knew the only way he ever wanted to lose his virginity was to a pair of twins.<br />
<br />
And now he was getting the chance. At least, he hoped so.<br />
<br />
Within moments, Kyle felt four hands moving all over him, stripping off his sweaty clothes and leaving him naked on his bed, staring up at the two handsome twins as they stroked one another’s cocks to full mast.<br />
<br />
“I call his ass first,” said the twin on the left, Kyle having totally lost track who was who at this point.<br />
<br />
“Aww, you remembered how much I love your sloppy seconds,” said the twin on the right, giving his bro a quick kiss on the lips before grabbing a blindfold and slipping it onto Kyle&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
The twins leapt into action, with one of them lifting Kyle’s ass up into the air and rubbing his uncut cock against Kyle’s asshole. He shivered as he felt cool lube getting squirted all over his ass, followed by one, two, three fingers reaching inside and stretching him all out, getting his insides all slick and lubed up. With a slurping sound, the fingers were removed and immediately he felt a thick, warm cock begin to slide its way inside.<br />
<br />
“Oof, you made him so tight, bro!” Kyle heard one of the twins saying though the haze of his arousal, but couldn’t register what they could possibly mean by that. The cock kept pushing in deeper and deeper, making him moan and drool in pleasure. The moment his mouth opened, however, a second cock jammed its way into his mouth, nearly making him gag before he got into the rhythm of sucking it off. Despite having never sucked a cock or gotten fucked in the ass before, he found that it was like second nature to him. He moved back and forth, feeling the twin cocks sliding around inside him as his own rock-hard cock slapped against belly, drooling precum all over his bed. A hand reached around from behind and grabbed his cock tightly, stroking him off in the same rhythm as the cock slamming against his prostate and making him moan loudly around the thick cock filling his mouth.<br />
<br />
“He’s such a perfect little bottom, bro!” he heard someone saying, and Kyle had to agree. This was like a dream to a perfect bottom like Kyle had become, and the combination of the thick cock pounding against his asshole and the identical one slamming into the back of his throat had him cumming again and again into the new sheets he had just put onto his bed. The twins finally came at the same time, filling Kyle up from the front and back and making all of his muscle bottom dreams come true.<br />
<br />
Jim and Andy gently pulled their cocks out from Kyle, leaving him panting and drooling on the bed. “So, was that better than playing with your toys, Kyle?” Jim said, pulling off the blindfold and running a hand against one of Kyle’s perky, sensitive nipples.<br />
<br />
“A million times better… So amazing…” Kyle mumbled, still in a daze after the incredible experience of losing his virginity to the sexy twins.<br />
<br />
“Well, get ready to make it two million, ‘cause we’re only half done,” Andy said seductively as Kyle saw the twins switch places and get ready for round two.<br />
<br />
==============================<br />
<br />
In the end, Kyle was practically comatose on the bed, the room reeking of sweat, lube, and cum. Andy leaned in to check that the poor guy hadn’t had a heart attack or something, then lay back on the bed as well. Until now, he’d wondered a bit if this was what he really wanted; he could go back and use the Chronivac to go back to his old female body and forget this all ever happened. But, the rush of power he felt double-teaming this hot dude with his bro like it was nothing convinced him that this was who he wanted to be. He looked over at Jim and had a feeling his twin brother was thinking the same thing. They were twins, after all, so how couldn’t they be thinking the same thing?</p>
