<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Liam. Wake up.&quot; Liam rolled over in the small bunk with a bit of a groan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five more minutes.&quot; He mumbled under his breath. He felt a hand grip his shoulder through the blanket and give him a little shake.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, dude. First bell was five minutes ago. Get ready so we can go get the campers down to breakfast&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t they do it themselves one morning?&quot; Suddenly the strangeness of the situation hit Liam. That wasn&#39;t his mother&#39;s voice, it was some guy. And not.. what was his name? Alex? Not Alex either. He remembered the flat tire, being put in the cabin with his mother, dinner, going to sleep, then..<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes. He was in the cabin, or a cabin, but then he looked over to the speaker, only to have an otter face suddenly fill his vision. He clamped down on his first instinct to scream. Especially since his mind instantly put a name to the otter. Grayson. His cabin mate and partner for this weekend. Why did he think it should be odd his coworker was a humanoid otter? Because there&#39;s no such thing? Well, obviously there was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get up.&quot; The otter said with a grin and only mild admonishment as he went back to his bunk. Grayson was naked, though he was reaching for a pair of swim trunks to put on, somehow Liam knew in order to take a shower. The otter was fit and athletic, his muscles not bulky but still trim and defined. The fur between his hair was slicked back and bright blond compared to his brown fur, and the only thing he had on was a shark-tooth necklace, at least until he pulled his shorts on. Definite surfer or beach bum vibe from the guy. Liam found his eyes drifting down the otter&#39;s lean back to his round rear under that thick tail and felt something stir between his legs.<br />
<br />
A towel hit Liam in the face. &quot;Shower now, check out my ass later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Liam was glad the towel was hiding his suddenly furious blushing. But Grayson was right, he needed to go take a shower before rounding up the little critters to get them, and himself, fed. Wait.. no. He didn&#39;t work here. Except his thoughts were telling him he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Catch up, or I&#39;ll come back with a bucket of water.&quot; Grayson cheerfully admonished as he left the cabin.<br />
<br />
Liam had so many questions, and none. He wanted to know what was going on, but knew that he was a counselor at this camp. But how? He shifted on his bed and dropped his feet to the floor. It was then he did let out a little shout of surprise. His legs were hairy!  And not just a little hairy, they were covered in.. was that fur? Brown fur? He looked down to his feet and was greeted with a sight more like paws, long, and tipped with black claws. Spreading the toes apart he noticed webbing between them.<br />
<br />
Was he an otter, too? He jumped out of bed, wobbling slightly before balance took over. It was easier if he didn&#39;t think about it, or the sudden weight tugging at his backside. His whole body was covered in brown fur. And it wasn&#39;t his body either. There was nothing about him that stood out, except the body below him looked like it belonged to some sort of jock. He had muscles. More muscles than Grayson. He was buff! He ran his hands over his chest and down his stomach, even through the brown shaggy fur he could feel those hard slabs of muscle. He gave his arms a flex in front of him, they must have been as thick as his old legs. He didn&#39;t feel very tall though, in fact, he felt like he was still his old height of 5&#39;8&quot; but he was a powerhouse. He knew it came from working summers of manual labor at his family lumber mill, helping to haul giant logs, then school years on the football and rowing teams.<br />
<br />
Between his legs hung his manhood, kind of like him, not the longest, but thick. Then his tail caught his eye, wide, flat and furless. No... he wasn&#39;t an otter. He ran over to the dresser where he knew there was a mirror. Counselor privilege and was met with an entirely alien face. A large muzzle dominated most of his face with a rather obvious pair of front teeth. The fur on his head between his small round ears was cut in a crest he knew with a little gel he could get to stand into a mohawk, he couldn&#39;t while at camp due to dress code, though he could get away with the fact it was dyed a bright shade of blue. He did that when he went to college, trying to separate himself from the country beaver he had grown up as, to stand out a little. College he was fi.. no.. he was nineteen.<br />
<br />
What was he doing? He didn&#39;t have time to gawk at himself in the mirror. He needed to get showered and catch up with Grayson. Sure, the otter might act lazy but he kept up with his work. Liam on the other hand never let himself fall behind. They&#39;d both be down at the lake all day, Grayson on swimming and Liam teaching rowing and canoeing. He preferred fishing days, but as long as he was on the water. He grabbed a pair of shorts that he slipped on and the towel he had left back on the bunk.<br />
<br />
On his way to the showers a thought passed through his mind. Where was his mother? Two answers came to mind.. &#39;Back home&#39; and &#39;Somewhere around here&#39; but neither raised a panic in him.</p>
