<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Halloween was definitely on everyone&#39;s minds, this time of year had another meaning for a special couple. Anton and Marlysa were celebrating their first anniversary of being married. The two of them have gotten a few gifts from the community. Among them was a bottle of a carbonated grape juice that they were both enjoying as it was the closest thing to champagne.<br />
<br />
Marlysa sipped from her glass and said, &quot;It&#39;s hard to believe that a little more than a year ago, I was only your pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;ve had so much in our first year,&quot; said Anton, &quot;We have new positions at a different school, a pair of gold medals from the IAC, and our own kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marlysa smiled as she snuggled next to her husband. She looked at the ring on her finger, remembering when Anton had given it to her after she had been uplifted.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Like most animals, Marlysa was a simple creature. She was content with having food, water, a warm place to sit, and a safe place to sleep. Reptiles tended to be a bit indifferent to their owners, only showing interest when it was feeding time. But Marlysa was always eager to see Anton when he got home. She particularly enjoyed how he held her on his arm while he reading at night. Marlysa felt a lot of affection towards Anton, as well as a need for a mate. But she didn&#39;t know how connected those feelings were until she was changed.<br />
<br />
Marlysa didn&#39;t think anything was different from the tap water she had been given that day, except that it has a strange tang to it. But then, she felt her whole body heating up and starting to convulse. Before long, she noticed she was growing larger and instinctively knew she was going to become bigger than her terrarium. Standing up on her hind legs, which she found easier than before, she pushed against the top of the terrarium before her claws were able to catch it and slide it open. Gripping the edge of the terrarium, her paws now having thumbs, she climbed out. The terrarium was kept on a desk, but it wasn&#39;t too hard for Marlysa to jump to a nearby chair.<br />
<br />
As Marlysa climbed off the chair, she became aware that she was easily standing on her hind legs. Looking at her front paws, she could see how much they&#39;ve become like human hands. More awareness entered her mind as she took on an increasingly human form. Her form became more feminine as her waist bent inwards as her hips flared out. Then Marlysa felt a peculiar sensation on her chest. Touching it with her new hands, she could feel growing mounds that were tipped with extra-sensitive points. Her expanding mind told her they were breasts, like human women have. As she rubbed them, she found herself hoping that Anton would like them.<br />
<br />
It was then that her uplifted mind made the connection between her affection for Anton and her need for a mate. It was more than just a simple pet&#39;s affection. Marlysa felt...love. She knew what the word meant, a long with a lot of other words. She was able to see Anton more clearly than ever, how lonely he had been ever since his first wife died. Marlysa wanted more than ever to comfort Anton and fill the void in his life that Joyce had left. But she&#39;ll need to wait for Anton to get home and think of what she&#39;ll say to him.<br />
<br />
Anton had heard a lot of strange rumors that day, of animals becoming sentient. But he hadn&#39;t seen anything like that himself. So he was really surprised when he walked through the front door and found a naked lizard woman sitting in his living room. &quot;Who are you? What are you?&quot; he asked, wondering if he&#39;d have to fight it or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anton, it&#39;s me, Marlysa,&quot; said the lizard woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marlysa?&quot; asked Anton. Now that he took a good look at her, he could see she was an iguana like Marlysa and he also saw that her terrarium was empty. &quot;How is this possible?&quot; asked Anton.<br />
<br />
Marlysa shrugged and said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure, but I think there was something in the water. I was drinking and suddenly I started growing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anton look at Marlysa&#39;s body, trying not to linger on her bare breasts. &quot;Well, you certainly got a good body,&quot; said Anton.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s more than just my body that grew,&quot; said Marlysa, getting and walking over to him. They were about the same height, though Anton was slightly taller. &quot;My mind has grown and I understand more than I knew then. Anton, I know you&#39;ve been lonely since Joyce died.&quot; Anton winced. The sting of Joyce&#39;s death by a hornet sting was still sharp. &quot;But I know that you&#39;re still a kind, caring man who deserves to be with a good woman, and I hope I can be that woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Anton.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anton, I love you. I loved you as an iguana, even though I didn&#39;t really knew what it meant then. I can&#39;t think of a reason why I shouldn&#39;t love you,&quot; said Marlysa, putting her arms around him, &quot;Do you think you can love me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anton was torn. This situation was still very bizarre and he was aware that bestiality was a sin. But that should only apply if was fornicating with a dumb animal, right? And Marylsa seemed everything but dumb now. Shouldn&#39;t she count as a woman now that she was like this? And he had to admit he would want some female company in his life again. &quot;Well, I think we can at least try,&quot; he said, placing a kiss on her lips.<br />
<br />
Not long afterwards, Anton felt a strange tingling in his lips and then the rest of his skin. He reached up to feel his face, surprised to feel scales forming. Marlysa stepped back and said with surprise, &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t know that would happen.&quot; Anton could see green scales forming over his arms as his fingers became tipped with claws. He soon felt discomfort as his shoes became too tight. He hurried to take them off, revealing the reptilian toes that he now had. His pants didn&#39;t get any warning as his tail grew out, quickly ripped them and his underwear apart. Tiny spines were going up Anton&#39;s back as a dewlap formed under his chin. &quot;Oh, Anton, I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t know you would change,&quot; said Marlysa.<br />
<br />
Anton removed the remains of his pants. Somehow, he was now a humanoid iguana himself. But he didn&#39;t feel so bad. In fact, he felt better in ages. He looked over to Marlysa, who was a lot more attractive to him now. He felt the desire for a new wife, a new mate and Marlysa seemed like a perfect match. He had felt a strong bond with her when she was just a lizard and now that she was a woman, Anton could feel his heart fluttering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least it won&#39;t be bestiality now,&quot; he said, &quot;But there is one more thing to do before we mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; asked Marlysa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me,&quot; said Anton, walking to his bedroom as Marlysa followed. Anton went to his side table and picked up a ring. It had been Joyce&#39;s and he had kept it there since her passing away. &quot;Marlysa, I know this might be odd for you,&quot; said Anton before getting down on one knee and presenting her the ring, &quot;But would you marry me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marlysa gasped. She had a vague notion of what marriage was and knew that humans put more value into it than simply being mates. And it touched her deeply that Anton wanted her as his wife. &quot;Oh, yes, yes, Anton,&quot; she said ecstatically.<br />
<br />
Anton slipped the ring on, which was a little tight. He might need to take it to be fitted later. But right now, all that mattered was the heat he was feeling. &quot;And now we&#39;re engaged, I think it&#39;s time we try these new bodies,&quot; he said as he removed his shirt. His crotch felt rather different now that his balls were internal and his penis was hidden in a sheath. But now it emerged again, a different shape and color, but ready to perform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, I&#39;d like that,&quot; said Marlysa before lying down on the bed and lifting her tail.<br />
<br />
Anton flipped her over and said, &quot;Let me show you how humans mate.&quot; Then he plunged his rod into her waiting hole. They both moaned as he entered her deep before he pulled back and plunged again. Marlysa didn&#39;t know mating could feel this good, especially when Anton started fondling her breasts. Anton was a bit surprised to actually find milk coming from them, but it only turned him on more. They were so focused on their lovemaking that they didn&#39;t notice their bodies changing further.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until Anton woke up in the morning after a night of passion that he noticed something different. He noticed his arms were thicker than he remembered them being. Then he looked down at his chest and was surprised to see that all the growing flab he had gained after his career was gone. In fact, he was more muscular than he had ever been before, with very broad pectorals and an eight-pack set of ribs. He also felt a lot more energy, like he was young again.<br />
<br />
His self-examination awoke Marlysa. She looked at her fiance and was surprised to see how muscular he was now. &quot;Wow, you&#39;ve gotten bigger,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Anton looked back at Marlysa and said, &quot;So have you.&quot; Marlysa had an athletic build before, but now she was almost as ripped as Anton herself, her muscles thickly detailed. But they didn&#39;t detract from her feminine beauty. If anything, it seemed to enhance it.<br />
<br />
Marlysa looked at herself and said, &quot;Huh, I did not see that coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not objecting to it,&quot; said Anton, his penis emerging from its sheath again.<br />
<br />
Marlysa smiled and said, &quot;Who would?&quot; She laid back as Anton entered her again, with more vigor than before.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Penny for your thoughts?&quot; asked Anton.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just remembering when we first became mates,&quot; said Marlysa, grasping Anton&#39;s hand with hers so that their rings touched.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the best days of my life,&quot; said Anton.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, any ideas for the day?&quot; asked Marlysa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was thinking we could go out for a fancy dinner, make sure the kids are tucked in, then we spend the night having tender, emotional sex,&quot; said Anton.<br />
<br />
&quot;You thinking about making another clutch?&quot; inquired Marlysa.<br />
<br />
&quot;That...might have to wait until our current clutch is older,&quot; said Anton, &quot;I didn&#39;t know you iguanas were such explosive breeders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of our eggs are eaten before they&#39;re hatched and some hatchlings never make it past their first year,&quot; said Marlysa, &quot;Of course we need to lay many eggs at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, four kids is enough for me right now,&quot; said Anton.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got all I need being right here,&quot; said Marlysa. Just then, she heard a chorus of peeping. &quot;Oh, they&#39;re hungry again,&quot; she said as she got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could just give them bottles,&quot; said Anton.<br />
<br />
&quot;And miss out on the joys of breastfeeding?&quot; asked Marlysa, &quot;I was given these breasts for a reason.&quot; Anton watched her walk away, already hoisting up her shirt and undoing her bra so she could feed her children. Anton considering himself very lucky to have such a wonderful wife.</p>
