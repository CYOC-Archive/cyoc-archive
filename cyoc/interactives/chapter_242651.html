<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad was in hell. Matt had promised to make him human that morning, but he hadn&#39;t.  He had started out like he was going to change Chad back. He even set the cup next to Chad&#39;s clothing. Then he picked Chad up, and said he didn&#39;t have time, but he would change him back later.<br />
<br />
The twenty minute morning break came, and went. So did the lunch period. Chad had hoped Matt would restore him then. But he had told Chad that he needed to wear Chad for every practice and game. So maybe after soccer practice, Matt would change Chad back. But after practice, Matt checked his phone and muttered something about not enough time, and changed into his street clothes without removing his cup or jockstrap.<br />
<br />
Chad tried to psychically demand that Matt honor his word to change Chad back into a man. If Matt heard, he didn&#39;t acknowledge it. Chad&#39;s thoughts turned darker. He wondered who talks to their athletic cup? Who honors a promise to underwear?<br />
<br />
Matt had planned to change Chad back. At least that was what he told himself, but he had gotten to school with plenty of time to jerk off a load into Chad before school, but he dawdled. He set the CUP on the ground next to Chad&#39;s clothing, but then picked Chad up, and shoved Chad back inside his athletic supporter.  He lied about the time and ran to class - but he ran around the school building 4 or 5 times before going inside. <br />
<br />
Chad was in the dark.  So he didn&#39;t know that Matt went back to the field house during the morning break. Matt had convinced himself that Chad would either jerk off or have a quickie with a coed and become Matt&#39;s athletic cup again. So why waste his seed until he had a solution to keep horny Chad chaste. He collected Chad&#39;s clothing from the field house floor and stowed it in his gym bag.<br />
<br />
During lunch hour, Matt researched male chastity devices. Then he attended afternoon classes, and soccer practice. After practice he changed without removing his cup.<br />
<br />
He found an adult toy store on Google maps that was on his way home, and bicycled there to check out their male chastity devices. <br />
<br />
There were plastic ones, leather ones, cloth ones, metal ones, and some were combinations of both. The prices were a lot higher than he expected.  He knew exactly how much money he had in his wallet, but there was not enough. Then he remembered that he had Chad&#39;s wallet in his gym bag.<br />
<br />
He thought there might be 20 or 30 bucks, but Chad had apparently had big plans for the weekend, and had visited the ATM before school. Jackpot! <br />
<br />
Matt reentered the store, and bought the tiny shiny chrome cock cage with two big chrome padlocks. Matt even had enough of Chad&#39;s cash to have it engraved: c.u.p.<br />
Property of MATT N. McELROY.<br />
<br />
Matt headed home with Chad&#39;s wallet lighter, and the gym bag heavier with his metal trophy for his trophy boy.<br />
<br />
But when he got home Matt remembered how empty he felt when he removed the cup or took off the jockstrap. That morning, Matt had only taken a 2 minute shower instead of his customary 10 minute one because he couldn&#39;t not be without his c.u.p. a minute longer. Besides how would he explain Chad to his mother.  He told himself he would change Chad back tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Of course, Matt had a wet dream that night. He woke with a shredded athletic supporter, and naked Chad with Matt&#39;s erection buried in Chad&#39;s anus. Chad&#39;s hands gripped his cock trying to keep from coming. Matt had told him that his own ejaculation would change him back into an athletic cup. Chad believed him, and while Matt wasn&#39;t really sure if this was true, but he liked controlling Chad, and this was another way to do that. <br />
<br />
Matt helped Chad to the shower, and cold shower helped shrink Chad&#39;s manhood. Matt couldn&#39;t help but admire Chad&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
Matt gazed upon Chad&#39;s tattoos, Matt really owned that hunk. Matt licked his lips. He felt a feeling he didn&#39;t understand. Croesus, Jacob Marley, Ebenezer Scrooge felt the same way about money, the same way Matt felt about Chad. It wasn&#39;t love, it was avarice, greed, possessiveness. He loved owning that hunk of meat with the shrinking salami in his shower. Every girl and probably 20% of the guys wanted to have sex with Chad, but only Matt owned him. Matt looked down at his renewed erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, Chad, you want to stay human until soccer practice? I could use a bj right now.&quot; Matt licked his lips.<br />
<br />
Chad shuddered. The shower was cold, but he had turned his back toward Master Matt. He turned around and knelt, as Matt reached over his shoulder and turned up the water temperature.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want to give head, but if it meant remaining flesh and bone instead of a plastic athletic cup, he would do it.</p>
