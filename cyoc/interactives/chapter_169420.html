<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec looked at the ogre, he needed to act now. It had it&#39;s back turned to him and stood peering at the destruction her mistress had wrought. &quot;Possession.&quot;<br />
A flash of light followed and Alec immediately regretted the change. The world once filled with amazing smells, wondrous sounds and brilliant colors was dulled beyond compare. It felt like he had gone blind.<br />
Compounding things this new body felt immensely heavy and slow. He looked at his new massive green hands, this had to do though.<br />
Behind him he heard the Nekomata hiss violently. He imagined the creature was probably quite confused, very scared and extremely angry.<br />
He struggled moving the giant body around on the short stubby legs, the knees were way to low compared to the weight on top. But he managed and spotted the witch. <br />
<br />
She was gorgeous. She was tall and slender. Perfect unblemished skin could be glimpsed through her long flowing gown. Her long dark hair seemed to flow like a river around her shoulders. <br />
Never before had he seen such a perfect being. She was absolutely radiant as her small feminine hands waved her long staff around, sparks following the tip.<br />
He was smitten. He felt his body go numb as he could only stare at her.<br />
&quot;WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT TITS! GRAB HER!&quot; She screeched. He felt compelled to obey, but then her saw eyes. As beautiful as her body was, as loathsome were her eyes. Endless pools filled with malice and hatred, he snapped out of whatever he&#39;d fallen under. Another bolt flashed from her staff.<br />
The thrashing Nekomata drew her attention. &quot;And what&#39;s gotten into you! Are you with her? You can join her!&quot; The witch screeched.<br />
Did she not see the flash of him switching? Was that just something only he could see? No matter, with the witch&#39;s attention on the Nekomata, he waddled over and wound up for a punch. He felt like he was moving in slow motion, how the hell had the Ogre managed to hit him earlier?<br />
&quot;WHAT!?&quot; The witch exclaimed as he threw his slow punch.<br />
As slow as it felt, it was fast enough. His massive fist collided with the witch. For but an instant he thought he&#39;d hit an old woman, brittle with age, he was sure he heard her bones breaking. The witch was launched back from the sheer force of the punch.<br />
Behind him Alec heard the other ogre gasp. He lumbered after the witch, who lay sprawled in the mud. She didn&#39;t seem broken at all. Her once perfect clothes sullied. She lay screaming incoherently, her hands desperately searching for her staff which had been sent flying with her.<br />
He raised his fist again. The witch made a weird cross sign with her hands, a cloud of smoke spread from her mouth. <br />
Alec&#39;s fist was mid swing, when he felt numerous sharp needles pierce his skin. He roared in pain. He heard a loud hiss at his ear. Desperately he swung his arms trying to get the Nekomata off.<br />
The other ogre lumbered in with surprising speed and swung her fist, the Nekomata bounced off well before it hit her. Alec however was not so lucky. The heavy punch knocked him off his feet and face first on the ground.<br />
<br />
From the smoke the witch rose clutching her staff. Her hair was flaring around her like wildfire. She turned her attention to Alec. &quot;HOW DARE YOU!&quot;<br />
No time. Alec looked ahead and spotted a cow hybrid with a womans head. Her long dirty hair was parted by two cow ears. It&#39;s fat body was dragging three udders over the ground as it tried to join the others cowering in the corner. &quot;Possession.&quot;<br />
A flash of light followed and again Alec regretted his swap. He felt slow and helpless. His loins were burning, the body was gripped by panic, but worse he felt a massive pressure in new unfamiliar parts. He tried to walk, but felt his hindlegs push into his bloated udder uncomfortably. He looked around, he needed another change.  <br />
A bright flash was near the Ogre&#39;s body. The once mighty creature had been shrunk to a size close to a baby. <br />
Alec heard the Nekomata screech as she went jumped off the second ogre. The third ogre joined the fray throwing a heavy beam of wood a the cat creature.<br />
&quot;A kitten it is!&quot; the witch cackled.<br />
She swung her staff, but the bolt hit only the ground the Nekomata had occupied only seconds earlier, followed by the beam of wood.<br />
&quot;STAND STILL!&quot; She yelled in frustration.<br />
<br />
Alec looked around, he needed a better body. Anything better than this, going to the witch however seemed like suicide with the Nekomata after her and him knowing no spells. Those ogres didn&#39;t seem like a match for her at all.<br />
He spotted Vivian laying on the ground near the fence.  She wasn&#39;t moving, but otherwise looked okay. Her arm guards were still on her arms. It was the longest range switch he&#39;d ever done before, but the explosion behind him told him he had no time to waste.<br />
&quot;Possession.&quot; Alec slurred through his thick tongue. Just happy he could even speak. Another flash of light. His body was hurting, he felt the same pressure he felt as the cow in his breasts and he was face down. He knew the switch worked.<br />
He crawled forward slightly trying to get closer, but her body was protesting every movement and dragging her sensitive breasts made it painful. He slowly got up and made the same motions he&#39;d seen Vivian do. He felt her arms tingle as a bow materialised. He pulled the string back, but quickly realized his folly. He never learned how to shoot. Even in carnivals he never won any prizes.<br />
He had zero chance of hitting the witch and even less chance of surviving the Nekomata if he slew the witch before it was taken care off. He looked around, she&#39;d said possession felt like a dream. He had an idea.<br />
It was a long shot, but he had no choice. He pulled the arrow off the bow and stabbed her leg with it. Creating another arrow he yelled &quot;VIVIAN! WAKE UP! Possession!&quot; <br />
 <br />
Alec saw Vivian blink as her consciousness returned. The witch cackled victoriously as the Nekomata was hit by two magic bolts. It&#39;s limp body fell from the air in the mud. To it&#39;s credit though, it had succesfully slain two ogres and, to Alec&#39;s distress, a cow despite having no idea when or why she did it.<br />
Vivian meanwhile had taken aim and let loose the arrow. <br />
Alec&#39;s new eyes didn&#39;t even see the arrow fly, all he saw was a green streak across the field and ending in the cackling witch&#39;s chest. For but a moment, Alec thought they&#39;d shot an old lady. He closed and opened his eyes, no she still had a pretty body. Her staff fell from her dainty hands.<br />
Surprise flashed across the witch&#39;s face as the power of the arrow staggered her. To his surprise a second arrow followed in her shoulder. A third arrow narrowly missed her head. Still, Alec was impressed Vivian was able to shoot with this frequency considering her condition.<br />
The witch dropped to her knees, her lips saying silent words. It had been enough. The arrows in her body withered and disappeared into dust, leaving only bleeding wounds.<br />
The witch&#39;s body blackened before falling apart into dust. Alec sighed, he felt weak in the knees and tried to sit down. He sat down painfully on a massive bloated udder and quickly got back up. Adrenaline was slowing down and he slowly became aware of the horrible body he was inhabiting.<br />
<br />
&quot;ALEC! Where are you?!&quot; Vivian called.<br />
&quot;Here.&quot; Alec slurred through his thick tongue. <br />
Vivian limped towards him, six heavy milky breasts swaying as she went. &quot;Here where?&quot; <br />
Alec halfheartedly waved a front leg. &quot;Here.&quot; He didn&#39;t actually want to be seen like this.<br />
Vivian&#39;s eyes went wide. She limped over and stood before him holding her leg. &quot;Trading up I see.&quot; She said, breathing heavily. <br />
&quot;Really? Jokes? Now?&quot; Talking felt very uncomfortable.<br />
Vivian crashed on the ground before him and tore a piece from her shorts to bandage her wound wincing as the pulled it tight. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
&quot;This body sucks, I&#39;m on all fours and I feel like I need to pee but I can&#39;t. How are you doing? You don&#39;t look any different.&quot;<br />
Vivian seemed to inspect his cowlike body. &quot;My mind is much clearer now. The spell is broken, so I should return to normal. It may take some time though. My leg hurts like hell though, did you really have to stab me?&quot;<br />
She put her hand on his head. &quot;But damn man, those were some moves you were pulling there. Fast thinking, absolutely amazing. I&#39;m sorry I failed the first shot.&quot;<br />
He shook his head. &quot;It all worked out in the end.&quot;</p>
