<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Anthony touched Charlie&#39;s hand with the medallion, he felt a shock and his head spin. Anthony blinked and shook his head to get out of his daze. Anthony was now sitting in the driver&#39;s seat of his car. He immediately looked at his hands and then the rear-view mirror of the car. Anthony was greeted by his own relieved expression. He had made it in time. He wouldn&#39;t have to be stuck as Charlie.<br />
<br />
Still holding the medallion but now in his own body, Anthony turned and looked at Charlie. Anthony, having experienced first hand what life was like for Charlie, felt bad for him but knew that  he had to reclaim his own life. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Charlie was looking dazed and Gino asked if he was all right and asked what the emergency was. Charlie responded and said that he didn&#39;t really remember but was glad that Gino and Anthony had arrived in time. <br />
<br />
While Charlie and Gino were making small talk, Anthony was thinking of a way to help Charlie since it didn&#39;t feel right to just leave him as he was. Anthony then stopped the car and motioned for his son to come out of the vehicle. Anthony told Gino that he was thirsty and asked Charlie if he and Gino could come inside Charlie&#39;s home for a glass of water. Charlie gave the green light and all three of them entered the home. <br />
<br />
In the house, Anthony recognized the dirty home from his time spent as Charlie. Anthony then asked Charlie where his parents were. Charlie muttered something, turned his gaze to the floor and grew silent. After a minute, Anthony decided to break the silence and offered to help Charlie clean his house and gave him some advice. He told Charlie that Gino had also lacked a bit of hygiene when he had hit puberty before handing Gino a broom. Gino sighed and started sweeping the floor while Anthony washed Charlie&#39;s clothes.<br />
<br />
In a few hours, Charlie&#39;s house was clean with fresh laundered clothes. The home was the cleanest that it had ever been. Charlie was also wearing clean clothes, had newly brushed teeth and just recently finished showering. He had taken Anthony&#39;s advice to heart and decided to keep his home and himself as clean as possible but told Anthony that his room might be a bit messy at times. That was good enough for Anthony and he hoped that he and Gino could continue improving Charlie&#39;s situation. Shortly after, it was getting dark outside so Gino had invited Charlie over (with Anthony&#39;s nudging).<br />
<br />
At Anthony&#39;s house, Gino and Charlie were chatting away while Anthony headed to his room and looked at the medallion of Zulu. He laid it on his desk and continued researching about it. Anthony managed to find an obscure and old website talking about the medallion after searching for a while. There were additional facts, rules and uses and recorded history about the medallion. Two things caught Anthony attention the most about what he was reading. The first was that after swapping bodies with a person and having to wait 12 hours before swapping back, it was possible to use the medallion to swap with a different person, which would also prolong the 12 hour grace period for swapping back. This differed from what he originally read about only being able to swap back with the same person. It seemed that over time, facts and records about the medallion had been lost or destroyed. <br />
<br />
The second thing that had caught Anthony&#39;s attention was that there was a record about people that had swapped bodies with one another and if they were able to switch back. The website had records of guys swapping bodies with one other going back hundreds of years. At the top of the record was his and Charlie&#39;s names, photos, details about the swap and the ending results. <br />
<br />
Anthony didn&#39;t know how the website had updated, but one thing was for sure: the website had a supernatural feel about it. Anthony wished that the medallion would never fall in the wrong hands or be accidentally used on an unsuspecting person. Anthony tried to destroy the medallion but neither fire, steel nor the elements could damage it. In the end, Anthony stuck the medallion in an unlocked drawer and went on with his life.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Charlie&#39;s appearance, mannerisms and life improved over time. He now sported short and styled hair, teeth that had finished being straightened with braces and he was growing into his looks. He had blossomed into a decent looking adult. On top of that, Charlie was spending more time hanging out with Gino and his family and didn&#39;t feel so lonely anymore.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the medallion of Zulu...</p>
