<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I...I think its working,&quot; Carlyle whispered. Clenching his fist the elderly man&#39;s eyes seemed to light up. &quot;I feel, stronger. Yes, I can feel it in my veins. Heh, heh, its working, IT&#39;S WORKING!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan simply narrowed his brow as he watched the elderly man retreat in years. Already he appeared 10 years younger, the wrinkles no longer as deep, his boddly no longer as frail, even the white in the old man&#39;s wispy hair appeared to be darkening to grey.<br />
<br />
Carlyle now slowly stood, testing his balance as well as his arthritic knees. The pain had lessened. Carlyle taking a tentative step forward shocked to find that he could walk once more without the use of his cane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still a bit achy,&quot; he said softly. &quot;But better than I&#39;ve felt in years.&quot; Ethan agreed, watching Carlyle cross the threshold into his 60s. The white in Carlyle&#39;s hair was gone now, replaced with grey and the start of a deep brown.<br />
<br />
Carlyle now took a small mirror from his desk, gasping in shock at his youthened appearance. &quot;I look barely 60,&quot; he said giddily. &quot;Ethan! Your a genius!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan said nothing, continuing to take notes as Carlyle grew younger. Amazingly Carlyle appeared to be putting on weight as his body. Carlyle now began loosening his belt as he reentered his 50s. &quot;Guess my body is regaining some muscle,&quot; he stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you were a swimmer right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in high school and college,&quot; Carlyle replied. &quot;Afterwards I started working and couldn&#39;t keep up with the demands. Always had a decent metabolism but you know how it goes. You get older, you get a little flabbergasted. Still, haven&#39;t looked this great in years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan simply nodded, watching Carlyle pass 50 and become 49. The elderly man&#39;s hair was now mostly brown, becoming thicker as his hairline crept forwards. With each passing year Ethan could see the man&#39;s body firming, becoming less flabby and more toned. Now flashing a million dollar smile, Carlyle admired his 40 year old appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look like a million bucks,&quot; he exclaimed, his voice stronger and more forceful. &quot;Ethan when this is over we&#39;ll have to grab a drink to celebrate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If your still old enough sir,&quot; Ethan replied. &quot;The virus has a tendency to leave someone in their late teens or early 20s. You could end up a couple years shy of 21.&quot;<br />
<br />
A now 38 year old Carlyle shrugged, watching as the last of his grey began to vanish. &quot;Price of doing business I suppose,&quot; he said. &quot;But Inguess that means I&#39;ll be attending frat parties then. Maybe score a few sorority girls.&quot; Carlyle now began to laugh at his own joke as he raced backwards through his 30s. As he began 29 Ethan eyes went wide in shock.<br />
<br />
Carlyle was a handsome man with a firm jaw, a toned and muscular body with thick brown hair. Ethan could see the why he had considered himself a ladies man. He was handsome, fit, and probably had more money than any of his romantic rivals when he had been this age the first time. <br />
<br />
Now though Carlyle was creeping further back into young adulthood. The man&#39;s handsome face and sturdy jaw were beginning to round, becoming softer, more youthful. Now instead of a young professional, Carlyle looked like an earnest business school graduate.<br />
<br />
&quot;God damn I look good,&quot; Carlyle exclaimed as he became 24. Hitching up his pants, he frowned slightly at the looseness of his outfit. &quot;Forgot how skinny I was,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Probably need to buy a smaller waist. Ethan if you can get this virus of yours to regress someone to their mid twenties I know quite of few friends of mine that would pay top dollar.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan nodded as Carlyle studied his face carefully. Becoming a fresh faced 20 year old he sighed. &quot;Damn definitely getting carded now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carlyle turned to Ethan, the young man&#39;s business suit bagging on a fit and lean body. Carlyle&#39;s face looking smooth, round, and boyishly handsome. &quot;Congratulations Ethan I&#39;d say your little virus is a success.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan said nothing, watching Carlyle closely. Carlyle didn&#39;t look like a man of 20 anymore. In fact he didn&#39;t look like he belonged in college. &quot;Sir,&quot; he said tentatively.<br />
<br />
Carlyle paused, noticing his suit appeared even baggies now. Picking up the mirror he gasped as he gazed at his boyish face. &quot;Oh my god,&quot; he whispered, trying to clear his throat as his voice sounded slightly higher.<br />
<br />
Carlyle looked about 17 now, the man&#39;s suit bagging around him comically. Carlyle&#39;s face had now rounded complete, losing any maturity he once had. Touching his face he gasped, his face was baby smooth, he probably could go without shaving for a day or two. Turning to Ethan, Carlyles eyes went wide as he watched Ethan appear to grow in front of him.<br />
<br />
Ethan watched as the virus completed its work. Carlyle was now 16, having relived a late growth spurt in reverse. Losing a few inches now made it look as if Carlyle had borrowed his fathers business suit. The cuffs of his pants accordianed around his feet while the cuffs of his jacket had crept over his wrist. Their was no denying  it, he was no longer a man he was a teenage boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened,&quot; he asked, his voice slightly higher and more boyish.<br />
<br />
&quot;You appear to be 16,&quot; Ethan stated. &quot;A bit younger than anticipated but still within the margin of error.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carlyle gaped, dumbfounded. Instead of college parties, it looked like he would be attending high school ones.</p>
