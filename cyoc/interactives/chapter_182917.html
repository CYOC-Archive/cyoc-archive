<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I actually sort of enjoyed this,” Fran admitted before pressing her lips together to spreading her lipstick around. She then puckered them and seemed to find them presentable. A cute smile spread across her face and she did a couple little poses in front of the mirror, soaking in her female body for what might be the last time.<br />
<br />
Harriette wasn’t going to try and keep a lie going either. She had also enjoyed the last week more than she’d intended.<br />
<br />
What had started out very freaky had quickly turned into a lovely experience. They’d both gone home to their dorm room after a little intimate time with their twin boyfriends and found that everyone seemed to believe they’d always been girls and that in a way their own brains believed that too.<br />
<br />
They’d attended a football game as eager girlfriends in the crowd, met up with the Knots twins for study sessions, and now they were preparing for another Friday night and getting all ready and presentable for the double date they’d been invited on. They both knew it was about more than just meeting the cute boys for dinner, this was where they’d try to turn back into guys and get the Knots brothers back to being the Knots sisters.<br />
<br />
“You think it matters what I wear?” Fran asked as she continued to vogue in front of the mirror in her underwear.<br />
<br />
“Doubtful,” Harriette admitted, though she’d dressed up very similarly to the previous week, just swapping out the light blue colour for a deeper cerulean. She was ready for her necklace to turn back into a bow tie but also hoped Fran wouldn’t notice the earrings dangling from her ears either. She only got a select few shots to wear them and had no idea what would happen with them once reality shifted.<br />
<br />
Fran drank up her appearance with a few more sighs before finding a completely different dress from the week before and toying with her hair. “Think we should have gotten haircuts?” She asked like that a carry serious and important thing they should have tried out as girls.<br />
<br />
“FRAN!” Harriette shouted and finally, they set off to meet at the exact same diner as last week. Sure it was a little lame but they needed to make sure everything was in order for their return to manhood.<br />
<br />
The place was really hopping when they showed up and numerous classmates waved at them as they passed by and both girls smiled as a couple guys followed them with lingering gazes. None of them would make a move though, everyone in that diner knew The Knots Brothers and no one in their right mind would try to anger those boys. The girls stopped at a booth filled with a couple classmates and friends and chatted with them for a bit, smiling as their outfits were complimented and basking in the feminine conversation for the final time.<br />
<br />
Then the boys showed up and both girls watched them pull up in separate cars with dreamy looks in their eyes. Milton and Winston Knots were a pair of identical twins who looked like walking daydreams. Wide shoulders, handsome haircuts, and brown eyes you could get lost in for hours. They were both footballers for the university team and Milton was a Mathematics major while Winston specialized in History.<br />
<br />
Fran sighed as she watched her boyfriend enter the diner. She was going to miss getting dressed up in uniform and cheering him on from the sidelines as a cheerleader at football games. She liked it more than when she’d been a footballer herself.<br />
<br />
Harriette meanwhile bit her lip while watching Winston enter. She kind of liked working shifts in the library and would miss the way Winston would show up at the end of her shift where she’d sit on his lap and read fantasy fiction novels with him in the back, praying no one entered the library late.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” both girls grinned flirtily before they and their boyfriends sat down, exactly how they’d been seated last week when they’d all flipped genders.<br />
<br />
Hearts pounded as they ordered dinner. Fear and anticipation filled each girl to the brim. They had to do a little finagling to make sure both drinks touched Winston’s lips but all that took was trading drinks and then claims the guys “had to try,” the other flavours. Then they just ate dinner, chattered, and tried not to let nerves ruin their last meal as girls.<br />
<br />
Winston was picking fries off Harriette’s plate when she finally noticed that absolutely nothing was happening.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to go touch up my makeup,” Harriette proclaimed with a quick directed at Winston’s cheek before she grabbed Fran’s wrist and pulled her into the ladies bathroom.<br />
<br />
She paced before the mirror with her hands behind her back while Fran watched and let her mind come to the only conclusion available.<br />
<br />
“So... we don’t seem to be turning back,” Harriette announced.<br />
<br />
“Oh no,” Fran gasped in a voice lacking any dread whatsoever.<br />
<br />
“It’s a darn shame,” Harriette continued with a mock shake of her head.<br />
<br />
“It’s really too bad...” Fran trailed.<br />
<br />
“I was really... looking forward to... being... a guy again...” Harriette drawer slowly. Both girls made eye contact and held their breath, seeing the same look in each other’s eyes. Then it all came rushing out.<br />
<br />
“Oh thank god!” Fran shouted.<br />
<br />
“I’ve been dreading this all week,” Harriette admitted while clutching at her chest in relief.<br />
<br />
“You too?! I only acted like this was a good thing because I thought...” Fran trailed.<br />
<br />
“No way, I never want this to end,” Harriette replied with a wave of her hand. “It’s just like... I feel right in this body.”<br />
<br />
“I had my first period and still want to stay like this,” Fran explained.<br />
<br />
“And the guys,” Harriette blushed while Fran swooned at the mere thought of the guys they were dating. Both girls smiled happily and exchanged a look before starting to laugh.<br />
<br />
“I’m so relieved you feel the same way,” Fran sighed.<br />
<br />
“Me too,” Harriette nodded, calmness and excitement flowing through her. She felt as if a big weight had been lifted off her chest. “I guess whatever caused this isn’t working anymore, and I’m actually glad about that.”<br />
<br />
“I’m more than glad,” Fran replied before approaching the mirror and pulling a tube of lipstick out. She smeared a little on and pressed her lips together until it was all evenly spread. “I don’t think I’d be able to live if I turned back.”<br />
<br />
“Well, shall we, a couple of permanent gals, return to our boys then?” Harriette asked with a light elbow of Fran’s side.<br />
<br />
“We shall,” Fran replied matter of factly before they stepped back into the diner and walked confidently over to the Knots brothers.<br />
<br />
Harriette and Fran thought about them dreamily as they slid back into the booth, both hoping to one day sign everything as Mrs. Knots. Fran leaned over and gave Milton a sweet little kiss, a look of content joy in her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Shall we plan some... after dinner activities?” Milton asked with a sly grin and mischievous look in his eyes. Fran began to giggle uncontrollably when he said that.<br />
<br />
Harriette began to pretend to choke in response, grabbing her neck in an over dramatic fashion and gargling while staring at Winston who burst out laughing. Fran and Milton shot them dirty looks before they began to kiss intently across the table.<br />
<br />
“So, you want to do any after dinner... activities?” Winston whispered in her ear and she felt a hot blush overtake her face. She then choked on a giggle that only made her boyfriend’s smile broaden further. She thought for second before nodding discreetly through her blush. She’d just found out she was a girl forever now. Why not celebrate by sucking her boyfriend’s dick?</p>
