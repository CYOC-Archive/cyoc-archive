<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diana couldn’t be happier as she did flips and barrel rolls around Whitney who was swimming forward watching as Diana enjoyed her new body with a huge smile on her face. Only an hour ago Diana had been Damon a human man who felt trapped in his male body when in his soul he knew he was a woman, now she was a mermaid. Finally she came to a stop as Whitney came to a stop, when she did her long silky smooth black hair fell down to her breast line, covering her hard nipples. <br />
<br />
“This is amazing.” Said Diana with her voice smooth and sexy.<br />
<br />
“I am so happy for you, my daughter.” said Whitney with a warm smile.<br />
<br />
“So what happens now?” inquired Diana as she looked around, they where not far from the island where her friends where still at. The sea around them was mostly sand covered but in the distance she could see the start of the coral reef which surrounded the islands. She couldn’t wait to explore those reefs…then a thought came to her. “What is lifelike as a mermaid?”<br />
<br />
“Life while wonderful isn’t free of work and duty.” Explained Whitney “There are communities of my sons, daughters and their descendants around this world. In time you will join them and make a life for yourself, including a job, a family if you wish and of course fun.”<br />
<br />
Diana let out a slight sigh…she knew she couldn’t expect a life free of work with only exploring the ocean, fun and of course sex. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry my daughter, I have been told by my other children that life as a merfolk is much more laid back and relaxing then the human world.” Explained Whitney before she smiled. “And for your first day, I know what you need to do to get used to your new body.”<br />
<br />
Diana knew what she wanted to do with her new body, she wanted to explore it but she didn’t want to do that in front of her mermaid mother. Instead she followed Whitney toward the back side of the island where her friends where. When they arrived, they passed over a beautiful coral reef which had multiple colorful fish and bright color coral. When they neared the shoreline, she noticed that it was a large and open cove with multiple small islands in the center with sand banks and there where multiple mermaids and merman.<br />
<br />
There had to be over 30 of them, mermaids, and merman of all different tail types, some smooth like her own while others had octopus like bodies like Whitney, still others had shark like tails or eel like. One even had what looked to be a lionfish like tail. All of them where of her age or order and all her beautiful and sexy, they all came in different body types of mermaids had massive breasts other small ones. Some merman had six pack chests while others had what she would call on a human a swimmer’s body. One mermaid was what on the surface someone would consider fat, but she looked strong enough to break an NFL lineman and beside her was a merman who looked even larger but stronger. They came in all skin colors as well as tail colors and for the first time she noticed that all the merpeople had pointed ears like elves in pop culture. Some of them had longer ears then others, some looked totally human aside from the point and others shot outwards a good distance. Diana reached up and touched her own ears, they where pointed as well…did that make mermaids a type of…what was the word..Fey.<br />
<br />
Somewhere lying in the sand, with the water up to their sides getting a tan other were sitting on the rocks talking, in one area a group of where getting massages on their backs and tails. She spotted a few groups in what looked to be little, tiny coves on the surface which had heated water like some sort of hot tub, there was a bar serving drinks how they drank underwater she didn’t know fully. To Diana’s amazement more then a few were making love. She saw straight couples, gay/lesbian couples and even multiple partners going at it. <br />
<br />
“Whitney.” Said a happy voice as a mermaid with an lime/forest green tail and short lime hair but a dark mild eastern looking skin swam forward. “I am so happy to see you again.”<br />
<br />
“Eleni…” greeted Whitney with the same happiness in her voice as she pulled the younger mermaid into a hug before pulling back and studying her. “I swear you look just like your grandmother when I transformed her all those years ago.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, she thanked you for that until she passed away.” Said Eleni as she looked past Whitney to Diana who was floating nearby, Diana blushed, Eleni was hot, not the largest breasts true but she had a strong core and her ass was to die for. It didn’t help that unlike just over half the mermaids/merman here she was bare chested. From what she could tell it seamed optional to wear cloths but most seamed to. “A new daughter?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, this is Diana formally Damon.” Introduced Whitney as Eleni raised an eyebrow, gender change while not uncommon when transforming was still rare enough to take note of. “Her friends are actually on this island, so please inform all your customers that if they come near them they are to treat them with kindness and tell them the truth.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, but are the dangerous some humans become dangerous when they realize they must accept the gift or loss their lives?” inquired Eleni<br />
<br />
“No…” answered Diana “At least I don’t think so.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Confirmed Eleni<br />
<br />
“Eleni could I ask a favor of you.” Said Whitney as Eleni nodded conformation. “Please treat Diana to whatever she wants, it’s her first day as a mermaid and she deserves to be pampered and I need to be nearby incase her friends accept the gift.”<br />
<br />
“Well, this is a spa.” Laughed Eleni “Of course, I will make sure she is well taken care of, and I will talk to the nearby tailor and hair dresser if she wants it.”<br />
<br />
“I thank you.” Said Whitney as she reached for a pouch she wore on a belt, the only clothing the bare breasted mermaid had.<br />
<br />
“No…you are our mother and our goddess, your money is not good here.” Said Eleni <br />
<br />
“I thank you.” Said Whitney as she turned to Diana “I will be back, in the mean time enjoy yourself and talk to my fellow children they will tell you much.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Diana as Whitney swam off.<br />
<br />
“So what do you want to do?” inquired Eleni</p>
