<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen woke up the next morning feeling a new sense of discovery. Calling up her storage quickly, she took her two legs out. <br />
Curious to see if her plan would work, she took her lower leg in one hand and the upper leg in the other and pulled. To her <br />
amazement, the leg came apart, leaving the upper leg with the knee cap. Continuing with her plan, she took her left arm off at <br />
the joint, leaving her shoulder, her upper arm and her elbow. Taking the upper leg that she had, she placed it on the joint. <br />
The leg fused onto her arm, so she took the hand which she had removed and placed it on the end of the leg. To her amazement, <br />
she could now reach all the way to the ground just from standing, not needing to use her foothands. Jen did the same with the <br />
other arm. Jen found the whole thing very strange, so she reverted herself back to normal.<br />
<br />
Jen was about to try something else when her cellphone rang. Picking it up, a voice came over the speaker, &quot;Hi Jen it's Amy!&quot; <br />
Amy said.<br />
Knowing exactly what Amy was going to say, Jen said, &quot;Sure! Come on over.&quot;<br />
&quot;OK.&quot; Was the response from Amy before the call ended.<br />
A few minutes passed until there was a knock at the door. &quot;Hi Amy!&quot; Jen said to Amy as she was greeted in the door. Jen and <br />
Amy went up to her room, and Jen said to Amy, &quot;Amy, you know the town's curse right, the T or D?&quot;<br />
Amy seemed a bit taken aback, but said yes.<br />
&quot;Well, there was this freshman kid named Kyle, and he used it on me, which has given me this awesome thing that would benefit <br />
both of us. <br />
&quot;O=ok,&quot; Amy said slowly.<br />
&quot;There's only one thing, you must not choose either for it to work right. Are you ready?&quot; Jen finished. Amy seemed a bit <br />
cautious, but agreed. <br />
&quot;Alright, here goes. Transform or Dare?&quot; Jen said to Amy. Amy said nothing for a minute, so Jen started by saying, &quot;Alright, <br />
you may speak now,&quot; Amy looked relieved, but said nothing. &quot;Here we go. For your transformation, every single body part on you <br />
will become detachable and interchangeable. When you remove a body part, all feeling and control will be lost with that body <br />
part until you re-attach it, then feeling will come back in the same way where it used to be, only in the new place of the <br />
object. Removing a body part is non-harmful to the body or the body part. Also, you may substitute inanimate or foreign <br />
objects and they will act in the same way as the object they are replacing. If you remove your head from your body, all parts <br />
still connected to your body will work well, as well as the head you removed. If you use animate objects from another body, <br />
those parts will act and feel and function the way they did on the original body. For your dare, you will be able to steal <br />
body parts from another person without their or the people around you's notice. When you steal a body part, you will be able <br />
to either put it in a shared storage with mine or attach it to your body. When you are attaching parts to yourself or <br />
modifying yourself, only you or I will notice. You can also take objects off and put them into the storage. When you steal a <br />
body part off of someone, everyone else but you and I will think that is how they have always been. When you attach, detach, <br />
or modify your body, you will be able to decide whether everyone but you and I will remember you as the new version of you or <br />
the any of your older 'version,' so to speak. You will remember me as I choose you to. Also, you will use the transform or <br />
dare curse on me once I am finished with this dare. You will Transform or Dare me, and I will say 'Dare,' and then you will <br />
say, 'you will be able to take on and off any body part whether it originated on you or not, whether you stole it or not. You <br />
will be able to use any body parts in storage any time you like with no limit, and no required use. You may copy parts in <br />
storage or on your body at will, and they will appear in the storage for use. You may resize any body part laying around at <br />
will. You may decide whether people other than You and I will remember you the new way or the old way.'&quot; <br />
<br />
And Amy's transform or Dare was complete.<br />
<br />
Under the Dare, Amy said, &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
Jen replied by saying, &quot;Dare.&quot;<br />
And Amy rattled off what Jen told her to, and the curse was set. Now, both Amy and Jen could enjoy the curse's affects without <br />
the unintended side effects. And, if Jen had something Amy wanted to try, she could do so without having to give it up. Jen <br />
could also try something Amy had by copying it too. <br />
<br />
From the start, Jen started by willing the penis she had in storage to copy itself five times. She went to the storage and <br />
took out all but one, and removed the heads of four of them. She linked the penis shafts together, and stuck it to her groin. <br />
Jen now had a 6 foot long, six inch wide cock, ready to test. Jen asked Amy if she wanted to be the first tester, and she <br />
agreed. Jen told her that she was going to do something first, and copied Amy's pussy. Jen took off Amy's nose, put it into <br />
storage and took out the copied pussy. Jen applied it between Amy's mouth and eyes, and decided to test.<br />
<br />
Jen slowly put her gigantic cock into Amy's lower pussy. Both Jen and Amy stared in amazement as more and more of Jen's <br />
monster cock disappeared into Amy's pussy, until the head of the penis popped out of Amy's face pussy. After going the whole <br />
length of her cock into Amy, about 3 feet were still left over. Jen started to thrust back and forth into Amy, Amy's 3 feet of <br />
pussy giving her intense pleasure and making her orgasm several times, juices flowing out of both ends of her pussy. As for <br />
Jen, she started to get really hard, and her huge cock grew twice it's size to over 12 feet long! Jen was nearing an orgasm <br />
too, her juices flowing out of her solitary pussy in a great flow. When Amy and Jen both came, their juices exploded over the <br />
room in an intense orgasm. After recovering, Jen removed the gigantic cock from her groin, leaving it in Amy. Jen took the end <br />
of the cock and pulled, giving Amy one last orgasm as the cock came out of her face pussy. Amy collapsed on the floor, exhausted, leaving Jen to experiment some more.<br />
<br />
Putting the huge cock in storage, she decided to copy her middle finger ten times. She took all ten out of storage and placed <br />
them beside her pussy, 5 per side. When that was finished, she used her fingers and closed off her pussy. 'Rape guard.' Jen <br />
thought to herself, then started to masturbate only using the fingers she placed near her pussy. The feeling was intense, and <br />
Jen orgasmed soon.<br />
<br />
Jen looked over at sleeping Amy on the floor and smirked. Nodding, Jen took the pussy off of her face and put it into storage. <br />
She then took Amy's eyes and mouth, and put them on the floor next to her. Jen next removed Amy's nipples from her breasts and <br />
put those into storage. Jen then took Amy's eyes and placed them where her nipples used to be, and then took her nose out of <br />
storage and placed below her breasts, then her mouth directly below that. Jen then removed Amy's blank head and placed it in <br />
storage. Looking at Amy again, Jen got a better idea. She took off Amy's eyes, nose, and mouth, as well as her pussy. Jen took <br />
her pussy hair and put it in storage. Jen put the pussy where her head was, then arranged her eyes, nose, and mouth so that <br />
they were in a face-like formation on her groin. Jen replaced Amy's nipples.<br />
<br />
Jen then took one of the cock-heads from earlier, opened her mouth and stuck it to her tongue. Testing to see if it would <br />
work, Jen started masturbating with her groin-fingers. When she came, the cock head did not function, so Jen tried something <br />
different. Jen walked to the bathroom and started to drink a lot of water. Soon, her need to urinate grew, and she opened her <br />
mouth, stuck her tongue out, and the cock head indeed urinated into the toilet. <br />
<br />
Amy stirred, then woke up. Amy noticed that her vantage point was a lot lower, like, as if she was kneeling. 'WTH?' Amy <br />
thought, and reached for her head to clear her thoughts, and found that it wasn't there, like it was missing. 'WTH?' Amy <br />
thought again. Amy walked over to a mirror and noticed that her legs were almost brushing past her face. Amy walked over to <br />
the mirror, saw herself and said,</p>
