<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The clown bounced his balloons around, the tank dragging along. Soon a he stopped at a young man, who was bullying the younger kids. Genie watched and gave the clown a nod of approval. The clown clapped his hands with joy and followed the big bully around. He was a 6&#39;5&quot; boy, just about to start the football roster for the college up the street. He was always a big boy, and loved to shove his girth around and beat up smaller kids. It helped he was also the strongest power lifter the town had ever seen, and he had the strength and gut to prove it! But coach said he needed to bulk up more to get in, so between shoves he shoveled food into his mouth. Eat big to get big the always say. Inflates the referee clown couldn&#39;t wait to get his tank on him!<br />
<br />
The boy wandered through the crowd, the clown clumsy following behind. Some of the people started laughing, thinking it was part of the show. Finally the clown came up to him, and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around, towering over him, and said &quot;what&#39;s up you stupid clown!?&quot; The clown paused with his hand, and showed him his gloved hands, then he magically pulled out a protein bar. It was one of those real expensive ones the guy saw at the supplement store, but this one was in a fruit flavor. &quot;This for me? Thanks!&quot; He gleefully blurted, grabbing it from the clowns hand. He opened it up and began chomping down. In a matter of seconds the entire thing was gone! The clown patted his gut saying in a high squeaky voice &quot;oooh! Big boy!&quot; And giggled. <br />
<br />
The man didn&#39;t like to be touched, but before he could hit the clown he saw his hand. Instead of his usual outdoor tan, his skin was now a weird orange color, like the bar! &quot;This is a weird magic trick isn&#39;t it? Well I&#39;m gonna save you the trouble everyone! I&#39;m not really turning into whatever it is?&quot; He wasn&#39;t sure himself but the clown just laughed and pointed to his belly button. Where one should be was now just a smooth patch of orange skin. He touched it, feeling nothing but himself, except now his skin was all shined up like rubber. &quot;Neat trick clown! How&#39;d you make my belly button disappear?&quot; Bewildered he never saw his hair disappear on his head. Bald and confused the crowd began to marvel around him. That&#39;s when the clown grabbed a step ladder and climbed behind him. He grabbed a long air compressor pump from his sleeve, much like those used for large equipment. The big orange man noticed after a second but by then it was to late.<br />
<br />
The clown thrust the needle into a hole that appeared on top of his head, and with a loud pumping noise, the pump did its thing. The orange man began to flail around, first trying to pull the pump out of his head, failing miserably. &quot;You bastard I&#39;m gonna deck you!&quot; He yelled trying to deck the clown. The clown just giggled and clapped his hands as the crowd laughed and pointed. He looked at a long mirror standing next to a t shirt stand and saw his body begin to balloon and swell. His power lifter gut began to swell and overlap his waist. His legs and arms started to become less defined, and swelled up, stretching his sweat pants and sweatshirt. He yelled to the audience, but by then his face and cheeks were puffing up, sealing his lips to the point it was just raspberries coming out.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the crowd just marveled where before the was a big guy, now was slowly swelling up into a sumo wrestler. He tried to turn around, the pump working up overtime, and tried to waddle to the crowd for help. By then his outfit began popping it&#39;s seems, and his cloths began to rip off from the swelling. His arms were becoming chubby cones with hands to match, and his legs and feet began doing the same. His shoes split out of there laces with a pop, and his swelling feet became almost bulbous. He was still trying to waddle over when his ass split down the middle, exposing his ripped underwear and huge orange cheeks. The crowd roared with laughter, watching as he stumbled to the ground, his body bouncing slightly and then teetering back and forth. <br />
<br />
He was almost completely round, his cloths ripped and scattered on the ground. His hands flopped up and down, his body still swelling. The needle on his head was still there, but by then he wasn&#39;t even worried. He rocked back and forth less and less as more of him was engulfed by the inflation. By now his arms and legs were taking over by his swelling midsection. His ass was now part of his back in a rounded form, and his neck was but a memory. Now down to his pudgy orange fingers he rasped his lips in a fart like sound, the clown giggling at him. He patted his round form and said &quot;oooooh! Big ball!&quot; The crowd began to clap loudly as his fingers and head slowly disappeared into him, making him a giant round orange bounce ball. Finally the pump stopped and the clown pulled out the needle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooh! Bouncy bouncy!&quot; He laughed as he bounced the 6&#39;5&quot; orange ball. The crowd cheered and demanded a repeat performance! The genie shook his head and said &quot;dumb humans! Let him have his inflated fun!&quot; And made a magic tent appear. A young teenager asked the clown &quot;hey! That was my friend, is he gonna be ok? If so can I have the ball to show him when he shows up?&quot; The clown nodded and gave him the ball. The teenage boy rolled his former friend home, the ball bouncing slightly as it hit a rock or bump. The clown laughed as he entered the tent ready to perform again....</p>
