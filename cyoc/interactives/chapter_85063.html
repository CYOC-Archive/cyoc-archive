<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The news scenes continued to play on the television and Timothy actually had tears going down hir face. Thankfully it didn&#39;t show any of the rapes that shi committed or the rapes that those shi transformed committed. The scenes showed Maurice and Ronnie approaching hir and and ultimately darting hir. Thankfully for any kids that might be seeing this on the news, there was no audio so the very adult things that were said were not heard, but that didn&#39;t matter. The biggest thing on the news was the response, particularly things were explained. Colorado Springs&#39; city council had already passed legislation that would make it nearly impossible for anyone to order anything from the New Chakat Industries and had sent propositions to the state government to pass similar legislation. Timothy Chakat knew that shi had made various mistakes in hir life, but never before had mistakes really been this serious. In one act to get what shi wanted, shi had probably sunk hir soughter&#39;s entire career, and while no formal charges had been named yet, shi shivered when shi heard the closing of the report that was being listed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Colorado Springs Police, while they have not yet filed any charges, will be contacting authorities in Janace concerning how the attacker on the Colorado Springs Zoo managed to get elements of the Kat Serum,&quot; the reporter spoke, &quot;and have made the promise that charges WILL be filled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never wanted thisssssssssssss...&quot; Timothy said weakly, hir voice carried a hissing tone to it, thanks to the fact that lizards, like snakes had forked tongues..<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Maurice told hir, &quot;I know...&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice didn&#39;t really know what to really say. Part of hir really wanted to scold hir father for what shi had done. Getting the DNA of a Komodo Dragon wasn&#39;t really that hard, but doing it properly would take time and would require the help of the zoo personnel to collect it. They had helped in the past with some of the rarer species that some people asked for, but Timothy&#39;s decision to rush things would likely kill Chakat Industries. With things being potentially infectious and the fact that an &quot;employee&quot; was the cause of the small outbreak, the reaction would be to block it. The state of Colorado would likely pass similar laws to what Colorado Springs in the next day and the US government would probably pass similar legislation in the next week. Chakat Industries had taken some flak over some of the fraudulent offices that Li Sang&#39;s people had formed, but escaped serious problems with the revelation that these copycat industries were fraudulent. That defense would not apply and the blame would fall squarely on them.<br />
<br />
It would mean the sale and development of the serum would end. Chakat Industries would likely remain, but it would only have the manufacture and development of the Vaccines as the only thing it could do, and with the Wise Vaccine now leading to the perfection of the Dead Vaccine to protect humanity which was also working, once the last of Li Sang&#39;s organization was gone and there were no more outbreaks, the sale of the vaccines would also end. Maurice wanted to scold hir father for that, but the tears on hir father&#39;s face made it clear shi had realized the mistakes shi had made.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re going to take your job away,&quot; Timothy answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the long run,&quot; Maurice commented, &quot;but then... with the way some of these outbreaks have gone, Snowy&#39;s of the opinion that a lot of it is too much. We might ultimately close down anyway because of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy only whimpered. Shi only wanted to win Janace&#39;s love, but that wasn&#39;t going to happen now. Shi&#39;d never thought that shi would be the cause of an outbreak and would face possible criminal charges for it, and that shamed hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, dad,&quot; Ronnie said to hir and gave hir a soft hug, &quot;I&#39;m sure we can talk with them... and charges will ultimately depend on the people you raped under the effect of the Virus&#39;s lust phase, which has generally been declared not the responsibility of individual...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ssssssssss with the outbreaksssssssssssssss you&#39;ve fought,&quot; Timothy answered, &quot;and the perssssssssssson that causssssssesssssssssss them isssssssssssss still held resssssssssssssponsssssssssssible... and in this casssssssssssssse, I am the one who issssssssssssssss ressssssssssssponsssssssssssssssible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We might be able to negotiate that you a pay a fine if anyone presses charges, dad,&quot; Maurice offered, &quot;Instead of jail time...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like that changes thingsssssssssss,&quot; Timothy cried and actually collapsed into Maurice&#39;s arms, hir head buried into Maurice&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Maurice sighed and hugged hir father. Shi heard the door open and was soon followed by the sounds of Alpha and Centuri talking to Snowy about some friends they knew from school playing with them and enjoying the summer sun. Shi smiled at their happiness and would surely try and find more about it later, but right now hir focus was trying to console hir father.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get in there, dad?&quot; Ronnie asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I paid the fee to go in, and they had no metal detectors or what they had didn&#39;t detect what I wassssssssssssssssss carrying,&quot; Timothy answered, &quot;I made it to their reptile houssssssssse and found one of the doorssssssssssss to the employees only ssssssssssssssection unlocked. All I wanted wassssssssssss the DNA and to be loved... but you all hated me for what I&#39;d been...&quot;<br />
<br />
Maurice hugged hir father tighter, &quot;We never hated you father. Never think that Ronnie or I hated you. We may not have approved of the way you behaved but we never stopped loving you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy felt a little bit better as shi felt Ronnie hug hir from the other side. Their fur felt soft and warm against hir new beaded scales, and eventually Maurice began to purr. It felt good, but it didn&#39;t change anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you did get the DNA though...&quot; came Snowy&#39;s voice from the doorway.<br />
<br />
Maurice turned to see both hir mate standing there with Alpha and Centuri on either side of hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpa?&quot; Centuri asked toward Timothy, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you furry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hir form is based of a Komodo Dragon, dear,&quot; Snowy said one of the two soughters shi sired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why doesn&#39;t she have feathers like Sammy and Gloria?&quot; Centuri then asked, sounding more curious than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Their forms are based off of true Dragons, your grandfather used the DNA of a large lizard from Indonesia,&quot; Snowy explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will shi go sunbathing with miss Casey?&quot; Alpha wondered, referring to Ryles&#39; mate.<br />
<br />
Timothy only cried some more, which soon brought about a different question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is shi crying? Kats are happy,&quot; Alpha asked displaying hir innocence for all to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because grandpa made a mistake,&quot; Maurice finally spoke, &quot;now... why don&#39;t you two go over and play with Mary and Fluffy or Shasta and Heather... or make sure that Snowflake hasn&#39;t started anything shi shouldn&#39;t with Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, momma,&quot; Alpha and Centuri answered and rushed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful crossing the streets!&quot; Snowy called after them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, daddy,&quot; they chorused to Snowy.<br />
<br />
Once shi heard the door open and then shut again, Snowy went to lay on the other side of Maurice.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you got the DNA?&quot; Snowy asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessssssssssssssss, I told them that you had a requesssssssssssssst for the DNA and was there to collect,&quot; Timothy said weakly, &quot;the people were a bit sussssssssssspiccccccccccccccioussssssssssssssss, but I managed to convinccccccccccccccce them. They got the DNA from one of their exhibitssssssssssss and gave it to me. With that I left and went one of their bathroomsssssssssssssss... and mixed the DNA with the formula line...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Without including the refinements that Maurice and I put in to private orders to insure that a new Kat isn&#39;t blinded by lust and is already vaccinated,&quot; Snowy scolded.<br />
<br />
Timothy tried to hide behind Maurice while the Persian Cat based Chakat gave hir mate a look that said, &quot;you&#39;re not helping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sssssssssssssssorry,&quot; Timothy spoke, &quot;but yesssssssssssss... in the bathroom I injected mysssssssssssssself... I wanted to feel what you all feel and I took it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy began to break down again, but felt Ronnie&#39;s hands rub the small of hir back.<br />
<br />
&quot;At firssssssssssst it hurt like you wouldn&#39;t believe... asssssssss my sssssssssssssspine rearranged and began to pussssssssssssh forward asssssss a sssssssssssecond sssssssset of ribssssss began to form,&quot; Timothy spoke, &quot;I think I ssssssssssscreamed in agony as I felt my forelegssssssssss grow... already tipped with clawssssssssssss and covered and grayish black beaded sssssssssscalesssssssssssssss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Snowy managed to look over the freshly made Komokat. Shi had a largely rectangular head and grayish black scales that did not glisten. There were some more lightly colored scales around hir eyes and what looked like a more pinkish color speckling hir back. Hir long and thick tail was banded between darker shades of grayish black and lighter shades of grayish black. Snowy continued to listen as Timothy continued to explain hir transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oncccccccccccccccccce I was on all four feet... my hair fell out and my ssssssssssssskull began to pussssssssssssh forward and my teeth sssssssssharpened and my tongue grew long,&quot; Timothy continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And forked,&quot; Maurice commented, knowing the snakes and lizards had forked tongues.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessssssssssss,&quot; Timothy answered, &quot;but then thingssssssssssss began to change, &quot;I felt a pulling ssssssssssensation between my rear legssssssssssss asssssssssss everything was being pulled insssssssssside me and then... then my changed penisssssssss began to push out... Then as I felt my breastsssssssssss grow, I had one last bursssssssssssst of pain as my tail grew out. It hurt... but by then I was a sssssssssshi and I got what I wanted... and then... then...&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi began crying into Maurice&#39;s shoulder again, hir breasts, smaller than either Ronnie or Maurice&#39;s shook as shi cried. Watching this, Snowy figured that Timothy was truly sorry for what shi had done.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you did after the transformation wasn&#39;t your fault in any direct way,&quot; Snowy spoke, &quot;you&#39;re only real mistake was being too impatient for Maurice and I to ask and get a sample of the monitor lizard&#39;s DNA legally and make sure the serum didn&#39;t make you a walking lust factory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And as I said earlier, we&#39;ll do what we can limit what happens with regard to any charges that are filed,&quot; Maurice assured hir father.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about your busssssinessssssssssssssssssssssssss?&quot; Timothy cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once the vaccine no longer needs to be manufactured, we&#39;ll find something else to do,&quot; Snowy commented, &quot;We could do lab work at the hospital... we could join Charlie and Sally in running their orphanage... and of course all of us can have families...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Familiessssssssssssss?&quot; Timothy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Maurice managed a reassuring smile but hir look soon became serious, &quot;I steered Janace away because you because you were still acting like a perverted playboy and I didn&#39;t want to see a friend hurt... but now... I think you know wrong that was. As a Kat now, you have a chance to start over, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find either a Kat or a Human or a Taur that will love you and who you will love...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll love being a mother when it comes,&quot; Ronnie commented, &quot;Every Kat, whether they were originally male or female, that I&#39;ve treated for their pregnancies has always been rather giddy about it... and... I must admit that it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to be pregnant, sith?&quot; Maurice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;More than anything,&quot; Ronnie nodded, &quot;But I&#39;ll leave that to Mina...&quot;</p>
