<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim walked around the large auditorium, hoping this was it. He would be alone for the last time. He was sick of being ordinary, average and lonely. He wanted to be part of a group, but not just ANY group. He wanted to be with the “cool kids”. <br />
<br />
He had never been very athletic or into sports that much, but he understood that these were the guys who received the most respect and admiration at school. These were the guys who would eventually go pro, make money and get the big scholarships in college, depending on the sport. Or, some of them would go to The Olympics, if they were really good in their sport. So, what could he do? What could he be? <br />
<br />
Jim wanted to be bigger, taller and stronger. He began to gravitate towards the wrestlers, who were near the back. Then, he spotted a small group of guys, who were all buff, but not necessarily the tallest, but they were all very fit. These were the gymnasts. This group also looked very appealing, for having the ability to do handstands and backflips seemed totally awesome. Finally, Jim spotted three guys in the back corner. They were all big and buff. They were all strong. They all had big muscles. These were the bodybuilders who spent hours lifting weights in the gym. Jim could only smile. This was his group. <br />
<br />
A small sign hung on the wall. “The Muscle Guys”. Yes, Jim was happy. He was home. He walked closer to the group as the ring on his finger began to get warm.<br />
<br />
His t-shirt suddenly grew bigger and wider as it morphed into a tank top. His jeans morphed into a pair of khaki shorts and his tennis shoes changed into basketball high tops, exposing his still thin legs. But his thin arms and legs would change soon. <br />
<br />
A warm feeling originated from his right hand (where the ring was) and spread across his arm to his shoulder and chest to his other arm as well. From there, the warm feeling came down to his torso, his groin and his legs. It was followed by an intense tingling in his muscles. <br />
<br />
Jim had to stop walking. The prickling sensation in his muscles had become too much for him. But the feeling was great. His arms suddenly bulged with muscles as his biceps tripled in size, filling out and becoming thick, powerful boulders of muscle on his now thick arms. His forearms grew twice as thick as well, and veins popped up everywhere, giving people the impression Jim had been lifting weights for years!<br />
<br />
Jim’s pectorals inflated like helium balloons in his chest, pushing his shoulders out sideways. His chest became enormous, with powerful spheres of muscle sticking out from his chest. Well-defined abdominal muscles surfaced below his big pecs like a washboard, forming an impressive eight-pack over his stomach. His narrow stomach became the support for his powerful wider pecs. His cock grew into a long 11-inch shaft with big balls while his quads inflated into thick pillars of muscles which resembled the largest tree trunks on the planet. His quads were so wide that they were wider than his upper body. His calves were bigger than soccer balls and all his muscles were now completely covered in veins as thick as ropes. <br />
<br />
When the amazing growth spurt ended, Jim continued to walk towards the three other muscle guys. He now clearly belonged to this group and fit right in. In fact, his arms were the biggest of all three!<br />
<br />
“Ummm…. Hi guys!” he said shyly as he greeted the threesome.<br />
<br />
“Well, look who we got here!” the taller boy said. “I’m Sean. What’s your name?” <br />
<br />
“Uhh…. I’m Jim…. Umm… Can I join your group?” he asked shyly. <br />
<br />
“Wow look at this guy! He’s massive!” the other boy remarked. <br />
<br />
“I’m Steve and this is Jordan! Sure, Jim! You look like a muscle guy who knows his way around the weight room! Welcome to the Muscle Guys! I’m the Club President!” Steve said, as he shook Jim’s hand. <br />
<br />
Jim just smiled. He was in. What a relief. Plus he was a muscle dude now!<br />
<br />
But he began to wonder about his two other geeky non-athletic friends, Alex and Tristan. It would be more fun if they were to join this group as well….</p>
