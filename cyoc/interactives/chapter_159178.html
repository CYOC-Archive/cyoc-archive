<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was usually a foregone conclusion that Ralph and Kyle would have lunch together in the teacher&#39;s lounge. Everyone expected it, they were known to be good friends among the staff, and even some staff thought there might be something more between them. No, Kyle asking Ralph about lunch meant something quite different.<br />
<br />
So after his last class for lunch, Kyle went off towards the back of the school to the old shop lab that was no longer in use. He slipped inside to find Ralph already there waiting for him, leaning back against one of the large worktables with his tie undone.<br />
<br />
Soon their lips were locked together as Kyle worked at the buttons of Ralph&#39;s shirt. They had made the mistake of popping buttons just once. Thank god Ralph kept a spare shirt in his desk. Kyle pushed Ralph&#39;s shirt open, running his hands up his lover&#39;s furry, taught stomach and pectorals.<br />
<br />
Ralph meanwhile had been working at Kyle&#39;s belt and pants and they dropped around his ankles, his underwear tugged down to quickly follow. Ralph&#39;s calloused hand, used to wrapping around baseball bats and dumbbells was gentle around Kyle&#39;s rigid cock. As he was being stroked off, Ralph buried his face against Kyle&#39;s neck, planting kisses and little bites.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s hands started working at Ralph&#39;s belt, and soon his pants and underwear were on the ground, too. Kyle knew there was a rumor around the school that Ralph was a bit of a horse downstairs. Except Kyle knew it was a fact. It had taken him a while to get used to being speared with eleven inches, all nearly as thick as a soda can, but training up to take his boyfriend had been worth it. For now he just wrapped one of his hands around it, stroking it as he met his boyfriend&#39;s lips again.<br />
<br />
During a lull in their making out and stroking Ralph spoke up, &quot;You know, part of me wishes I was bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bigger?&quot; Kyle laughed. &quot;I already feel like you&#39;re going to split me in two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not.. not there.&quot; He pounded a fist on his bare chest. &quot;Beefier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What like a muscle bear? Or taking up body building? What brought this on?&quot; Kyle was still eagerly coaxing Ralph&#39;s cock, though definitely curious about the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your gym buddy?&quot; Kyle asked, me knew exactly who Ralph meant, and the brief sight of Nate he had caught this morning on his way to the school. A shaggy, blond muscle bear, all beefy and.. Kyle&#39;s cock gave a twitch. Sure, he would happily screw Nate, if he wasn&#39;t besotted with Ralph. Though maybe a threesome with him pinned between the two muscular men..<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he keeps trying to coax me to put on more muscle, what would you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;d love you no matter what.&quot; Kyle knew it was true, too. The curse had made him fall completely for this man and he knew he was smitten for life. Part of him didn&#39;t even care the choice was taken away. &quot;And if I bulked up?&quot; Kyle asked with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? You&#39;re perfect the way you are.&quot; Well, of course he&#39;d say that, Kyle had been turned into his perfect lover, even as he said it he was stripping Kyle free of his shirt and vest. &quot;But if you wanted to, I&#39;d help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Kyle felt the words passing his lips. &quot;Transform or dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Ralph laughed. &quot;Now you&#39;re just messing with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle shook his head. &quot;No, trust me, pick transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ralph grinned as if he was just going to amuse his boyfriend. &quot;Okay, fine, transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle nodded. &quot;I want you to have the body you want to have, only you and I will notice the difference.&quot; And then he kissed Ralph as the man pushed him back onto the work bench, spreading his legs apart.<br />
<br />
Ralph stripped off his shirt, and stood naked at the foot of the worktable, as he grabbed the small bottle of lube they kept hidden in one of the drawers. Slathering up his cock first, he started to work some into Kyle&#39;s hole with his fingers. Ralph didn&#39;t seem to notice that his body was changing, though Kyle had a front row seat.<br />
<br />
It was subtle at first, his muscles growing and popping with newfound strength, months of weightlifting appearing on his body in moments. Soon, then head of Ralph&#39;s cock replaced his fingers.<br />
<br />
Then Kyle felt that huge shaft sliding inside of him, and he had to hold his breath to keep from crying out. It always hurt a little at first, but was always worth it. Then Ralph began his slow, steady thrusting, each thrust seemed to add a little more muscle to his frame. As speed built, so did the growth. Ralph wasn&#39;t a small guy to begin with, but he was becoming a bit of a beast. His arms gripping at the table were actually thicker than Kyle&#39;s legs. His pectorals had grown from hard plates to firm mounds.<br />
<br />
He was approaching the size of Nate when the growth seemed to slow to a halt, Nate would still have been the bigger between them, but Ralph was a whole lot more cut. Kyle watched mesmerized by Ralph&#39;s hard six pack as he flexed his core to keep up his thrusting.<br />
<br />
There were other small changes, his chest hair was a bit thicker and denser. Kyle reached up to tangle his fingers in those dark curls, running his thumbs over those large, round nipples, causing Ralph to give a little shudder. He also knew without having to see it that Ralph was now sporting an uncut cock, much like Kyle&#39;s. And his eyes, they were blue before, but now they were stunningly bright.<br />
<br />
It was like Ralph&#39;s desired changes to his form were more to enhance what he knew Kyle enjoyed about his body. As the changes came to an end, Ralph gave one last trust inside of him and came just as Kyle did, the two of them gasping and breathing. They stayed like that for a few moments, Kyle laying on he table splattered with his own cum, and Ralph braced over him.<br />
<br />
They were on a time limit though so, Ralph helped Kyle clean up, only slowly coming to the realization of his own change. &quot;Holy crap...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you it&#39;d work.&quot; Kyle couldn&#39;t help but grin smugly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s what a foreskin feels like.. always wondered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle laughed. &quot;That&#39;s your takeaway? Not the forty pounds of muscle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.. that&#39;s nice, too. But uh..&quot; Ralph picked up his shirt, looking at it, then down at his massive chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll fit.&quot; Kyle assured him, and sure enough the garment had grown, too. Still in Ralph&#39;s preferred close fitting style, which was even more ridiculously sexy than it was before. If he hadn&#39;t already been the hottest male teacher in the school, he certainly was now.<br />
<br />
They helped each other get dressed and Ralph suddenly asked, &quot;Doesn&#39;t the transform or dare curse pass from person to person as they&#39;re asked? So.. I can pass it on now?&quot; Kyle nodded. &quot;Where did you get it from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it back from someone I used it on. It&#39;s a long story, but both of us came out better for it, don&#39;t worry.&quot; Kyle was positive about that, both him an John-once-Jen were better off in their own minds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back? So that was the second time? How&#39;d you get it the first time?&quot; Ralph finished tying off his tie, but Kyle stopped in his tracks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I.. I don&#39;t know.&quot; Kyle was wracking his brain, but he couldn&#39;t figure out where he had first gotten the curse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to..&quot; Ralph stepped over to Kyle. &quot;Maybe we could..&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle shook his head and finished getting dressed. &quot;Leave it alone. I like where I am now, it&#39;s probably not worth going into.&quot; He kissed Ralph, holding their lips together for a solid minute. &quot;I&#39;ll see you after classes.&quot; And headed out, followed shortly by Ralph..</p>
