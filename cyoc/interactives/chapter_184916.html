<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Liz could do anything Roger had put down his drink, swept her into his arms and was giving her a passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
When Liz was able to draw breathe “Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing?” <br />
<br />
“Something I’ve been wanting to do all night”<br />
<br />
“Easy on there. Liz could be here any minute”<br />
<br />
“All the more reason to kiss you now. Are you telling me you didn’t like it?”<br />
<br />
“No I loved it” that was the truth “But can’t it wait?”<br />
<br />
“I hope not for too long. It has been a while”<br />
<br />
Liz could feel Roger’s penis pushing against her hips, certainly he was very eager. His hands were also caressing her backside. It felt very nice. Maureen’s body (which Liz occupied) was certainly turned on. She felt very wet down below. Her lips were covered once more by his.<br />
This time Liz did not fight back. She let her body respond the way it wanted to. Her hands felt Rogers tight little bum and pulled it tightly into herself.<br />
<br />
Roger was the one to break the kiss this time “How about we move to the bedroom?”<br />
<br />
“Liz will be here soon. How about you go to bed and I’ll join you later” That was very hard for Liz to say. She did want to move to the bedroom but she certainly didn’t want the true Maureen to catch her in bed with Roger.<br />
<br />
Liz got some separation from Roger and once more picked up Maureen’s phone. “I’ll tell her to either be here quickly or not come at all” Instead she texted. “Come quickly. Finding it hard to fend R off”<br />
<br />
But Roger wasn’t going to bed. Instead he was pouring more drinks.<br />
<br />
Maureen had just been told the taxi was 10 minutes away when she got the text from Liz. She chuckled to herself thinking of a randy Roger on the attack. He could be pretty persuasive when he wanted to be. She texted back “Probably 20 minutes. You will have to stall”<br />
<br />
Liz looked at the reply. She had turned the TV on hoping to distract Roger (and herself) but he took a seat beside her and snuggled up. “What’s Liz say?” he asked having heard the phone ping. <br />
<br />
“She’ll be 20 minutes” Liz replied putting the phone in Maureen’s handbag. She did not want Roger to see the text stream. <br />
<br />
“In that case……” Roger pulled her over and across so that she was on top of him and kissed her once more. Again she felt her body respond. She wanted nothing more than to start undressing him but had to show restraint. Once more she pushed away. “I need to go” she simply said. What she actually needed was to get clear of Roger and have some space so her libido could cool down. A visit to the toilet gave her that opportunity. Roger let her depart.<br />
<br />
Liz dallied as long as she could in the toilet. Maureen’s plumbing worked in exactly the same way as her own so that wasn’t a problem. It’s just how was she to deal with a randy Roger? It was clear he wasn’t going to bed – at least not on his own. He had not taken that option when she had presented it to him. It seemed he wanted to wait up for the apparent Liz. She remembered her muddled conversation with him earlier in the day. Was he planning to give Liz a cuddle? What would the real Maureen think if Roger greeted her at the door with the sort of cuddle and kiss she had just been given? It would serve her right actually. She was the one who was late and had landed Liz in this mess. Eventually Liz knew she couldn’t stay in the toilet any longer. She didn’t need Roger to come knocking and ask her how she was. She flushed washed her hands then to stall a bit longer fixed her make-up. Just as well she had looked. Maureen would have known straight away that the smudged lipstick was from kissing.<br />
<br />
She returned to find Roger still sitting where she had left him. He patted the couch beside himself indicating that she should sit there. Liz glanced at the clock. She had stalled for 8 minutes. 12 to go if Maureen’s guess was right. “I feel like a cup of tea” she said. “Liz might want one as well when she get’s here”. Instead of sitting beside Roger she went to the kitchen, filled the kettle then turned it on. She couldn’t help but notice the disappointed look on Roger’s face. He was obviously very frustrated as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway by the time the kettle boiled and she fussed around making herself a cup of tea (Roger didn’t want one) then bought out a plate of the muffins she had cooked that afternoon, it was less than 5 minutes until Maureen’s estimated time of arrival. She checked the phone to see if Maureen had sent an update but she had not. <br />
<br />
Fortunately Roger seemed to have got the hint and was no longer trying to molest her. She sat down on a single chair in the lounge not beside Roger and sipped her tea. Roger took a muffin but his body language indicated he was rather pissed off.<br />
<br />
They watched TV in silence until the doorbell rang. Roger was first to his feet “I’ll get that” he said. Liz wasn’t going to argue.<br />
<br />
Liz got up and put the kettle on once more. She knew Maureen liked her tea piping hot so she missed what happened at the front door.<br />
<br />
Roger let the apparent ‘Liz’ in then took her by surprise by giving her a cuddle and a kiss. Maureen accepted the kiss gracefully. Roger had always been a good kisser. Eventually though she came up for breath. “I gather she told you? So you know all about it?”<br />
<br />
Maureen was thinking Liz had told Roger about the body swap and that he knew it was really Maureen, his wife, in Liz’s gorgeous body. However Roger assumed Liz had come over so they could have a threesome as per the awkward discussion with Maureen earlier in the day<br />
<br />
“I do” Roger replied. “We had a discussion earlier” <br />
<br />
“And what do you think?”<br />
<br />
“It’s wonderful. You are a very sexy woman. What’s not to like?”<br />
<br />
That was enough for Maureen. She too had become sexually frustrated earlier in the night. Suddenly she had an outlet. She resumed kissing Roger. Her hand felt below his belt and the large bulge. She gave it a squeeze.</p>
