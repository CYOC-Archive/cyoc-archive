<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All the druid candidates were given permission to skip lessons to prepare themselves for the joining ceremony that was 10 days away. All the others were setting up the festivities as the Joining was a special occasion for the camp. The caravan would remain in the camp until the day after the ceremony to enjoy the event and provide services. Beverly had been running in the forest to clear her mind while Carl had been doing some high altitude flying to calm themselves. Vect was having no luck trying to calm himself. First he tried some crafting to distract his mind, but gave up after his 4th time he had injured himself due to his racing mind. Next he tried meditation, however he couldn&#39;t relax enough to do that. He was busy practicing his swordsmanship skills on a training dummy to vent his frustration when a gruff voice shook him out of his trance.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re distracted.&quot;<br />
Vect wheeled around in surprise to find Gorg looking down at him, arms crossed.<br />
&quot;How long have you-&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re second and fourth swings are slower and unfocused,&quot; Gorg lifted up a longsword effortlessly in one hand. &quot;Take a defense stance.&quot;<br />
&quot;Should I really be-?&quot;<br />
&quot;You are slacking. Need a proper opponent to practice with. I&#39;m here. Begin.&quot;<br />
Vect nodded and assumed a defense position to prepare for the orc&#39;s attack. Gorg began his demonstration of the proper way to perform the drill while Vect defended himself. After a few cycles, Gorg motioned for Vect to go on the offensive.<br />
As Gorg parried a strike he began to speak, &quot;you are nervous. I feel it in your strokes. Why?&quot;<br />
Vect sent another few attacks before replying, &quot;I am expecting a response from my parents after I told them where I was training.&quot;<br />
Gorg switched to a different stance nodded and began to attack, signaling that they were now sparring.<br />
&quot;Are you embarrassed to be here?&quot;<br />
&quot;No! No, I enjoy it here. The other classes were full and I had to come here with my friends. I wasn&#39;t sure at first, but now I&#39;m happy I got to break off of my family&#39;s path they laid out.&quot; Vect blocked another strike near his right leg, true they were using blunted training weapons but a hit could still leave a nasty bruise. &quot;I felt free when I came here.&quot;<br />
&quot;What changed,&quot; asked the orc as he parried a stab attack one handed.<br />
&quot;I recieved a letter from the last caravan from home asking where I was at and I told them the truth. I know they&#39;ll send a response telling me to come home. I can see it now, &#39;you obviously can&#39;t listen to us so we must keep you here to make sure you do as you&#39;re told&#39;,&quot; Vect said in a mocking tone as he began to build up a sweat.<br />
&quot;Ignore it.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s a letter ignore it. They&#39;ll have to wait a few months before they realize you are not going to reply. By then the year will be over.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I&#39;ll still have to return home after the year is up.&quot;<br />
&quot;Write to them and tell them no. They&#39;ll still have to wait a month before they receive it and another to reach here if they  come to get you.&quot;<br />
&quot;That might work. But I want to come back next year.&quot;<br />
&quot;You are nearing adulthood. From camp rumors your friend Jack is already a man,&quot; Gorg smiled as he locked blades with Vect. Jack and Lelu had tried to keep it a secret, but someone had heard their escapades from outside the bathhouse and newe had spread. It wasn&#39;t forbidden in the camp to have sex, but you had to accept the responsibility of it. True, pregnancy was stopped in the interest of continuing the student&#39;s learning, but both parties were punished when one became pregnant. Still it made Jack and Lelu blush when they found out about the rumor.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m also an heir to a noble house. I have a duty to them.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll just take a slightly different path. Couldn&#39;t hurt to have some alternate skills. Mix things up.&quot;<br />
They continued their sparring for 3 more hours, longer than Vect had ever gone.<br />
Vect was starting to pant heavily, sweat pouring down his bare chest, his arms ached from the match, but he felt calm somehow. More focused despite his fatigue. &quot;Thank you Chief, I&#39;ve decided to reply and tell them I&#39;ll find my own path and return when my time is up.&quot;<br />
Gorg grunted as he turned to leave, but stopped and looked back. &quot;Something else is on your mind.&quot;<br />
Vect shifted his feet nervously. &quot;Its Sara.&quot;<br />
&quot;The succubus?&quot;<br />
Vect looked down as he spoke. &quot;Yeah, her 16th birthday is coming up in 4 days. There is a chance for succubi after their first change, to change further every 3 years.&quot;<br />
&quot;So?&quot;<br />
Vect looked up at him in shock, &quot;what do you mean so?!&quot;<br />
Gorg shrugged. &quot;You care about her?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, she&#39;s my friend and I -.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant and you know it,&quot; Gorg interrupted in a stern voice.<br />
Vect sighed, &quot;yeah, I do care deeply for her. Ever since the trial, I can&#39;t get her out of my head. What if she transforms even more?&quot;<br />
&quot;So? If you really do have feelings for her, a change in her outward appearance shouldn&#39;t affect you. If it did, you don&#39;t really love her. You couldn&#39;t even call yourself her friend if outward appearance changed how you felt about her.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe you&#39;re right. But how will I know?&quot;<br />
&quot;When the time comes, you&#39;ll know trust me,&quot; Gorg put a large hand on Vect&#39;s shoulder.<br />
&quot;I guess I&#39;ll find out when the time comes,&quot; Vect began to turn away.<br />
&quot;I will warn you she probably will wanna fuck you senseless if she changes. Just a heads up.&quot;<br />
Vect returned his training sword, bathed and changed clothes from his thick hide loincloth to a more comfortable light green cloth tunic and pants. Dinner proceeded as usual. As did time to sleep.<br />
<br />
Next Day<br />
<br />
<br />
Vect was sparring with two others at once at the training grounds when the alert was sounded for the arrival of the caravan. Dripping in sweat from his training and sporting a few new bruises, Vect made his way to the outer area of the BTC, his thick leather loincloth allowing him to cool off some as he walked. The air was refreshing on him and he allowed it to calm him before he got his inevitable letter from home. As he neared the crowd people eager to get their letters and supplies, he noticed them whispering to each other. &quot;Who are they?&quot; &quot;What&#39;s with the armour?&quot; &quot;Why are they this far north?&quot; <br />
Vect tried to see what the throng was talking about,  but even at his height there were many that were much taller and he could get no clear view. He decided to push to the front to see what was the fuss. Upon reaching the front Vect regretted that he didn&#39;t stay in the back. <br />
Leading the caravan was 3 elves in regal looking gold and green armour with deep green cloaks on horseback. 2 men and one woman. The royal guard wasn&#39;t that hard to recognize especially his house&#39;s master at arms, Duinir Eroth. Vect started to push his way back into the crowd until, &quot;VECT!&quot;<br />
He froze, &quot;dammit,&quot; he cursed at himself. He straightened up sucked in a lungfull of air to brace himself and turned to face his escort, abundantly aware of the eyes from behind all looking at him. <br />
&quot;Master Duinir! It&#39;s good to see you again after so long,&quot; he said with a very fake smile. He actually did like Duinir, he just wished they hadn&#39;t sent him.<br />
The trio stopped their horses a few meters away before Duinir spoke with a sigh, &quot;my dear boy, I really don&#39;t like that I have to do this.&quot; Duinir looked at the ground and shook his head before he looked back at Vect. &quot;I really don&#39;t want to drag you back to your-.&quot;<br />
&quot;DUINIR YOU KNIFE EARED BASTARD! ITS BEEN AGES!&quot; Bellowed a familiar voice as Gorg barrelled through the crowd. Much to Vect&#39;s surprise, Duinir&#39;s mood shifted to pure delight.<br />
&quot;Gorg? This is where you&#39;ve been?&quot; He jumped down off his horse and when the two met, headbutted with a dull thud and they stumbled backwards slightly.<br />
Vect could only stare at his former master embracing the giant orc.<br />
&quot;What are you doing this far north Duinir?&quot; Gorg&#39;s brow furrowed as he glanced at Vect. &quot;Him I&#39;m guessing.&quot;<br />
Duinir looked back at his companions, &quot;we are in no rush to return. Well spend a few days here.&quot; The 2 dismounted as Duinir looked back at Gorg. &quot;Let&#39;s catch up. It&#39;s been years.&quot; <br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Called out Vect. He took a long breath before speaking for courage. &quot;Duinir I&#39;m not going back. I wasn&#39;t expecting you to be sent so soon.&quot;<br />
&quot;Lad, I have my orders. I&#39;m to bring you back, drag you if need be.&quot;<br />
Vect shook his head. &quot;I&#39;m not a child master. Let me prove to you I am not the child you taught 6 years ago.&quot;<br />
Duinir knew what was coming. &#39;Do it kid.&#39;<br />
&quot;Duinir, I challenge you as is my right as a man.&quot; The words made him feel lightheaded as he said them. &#39;Don&#39;t falter fool. You are doing great,&#39; Vect thought to himself.<br />
Duinir smiled. &quot;I accept. Gorg let&#39;s catch up over a barrel. Vect, we&#39;ll have our duel in 5 days. You win, I will let you stay, but if I win you come back quietly. Let&#39;s see what you&#39;ve learned in 5 years of schooling.&quot; <br />
The crowd dispersed and Vect left to prepare. Sara&#39;s birthday and possible transformation, a duel to decide his future, a festival, and possibly a joining with a dragon spirit. This week was going to be busy.</p>
