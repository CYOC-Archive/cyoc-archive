<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice can tell that Emma is truly interested and curious about their experience with the Transform-O-Matic and the objects they have been transformed into. She smiles reassuringly at Emma. &quot;Oh, no, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re asking these questions. I think it&#39;s only fair to be open and transparent about what we have experienced. So, like I already said, the very first time we used the Transform-O-Matic and I transformed into that green spandex cylinder several times to experiment with the settings regarding my mind. Then we added a special feature to my cylindrical form.&quot; Alice blushes. When she said that it was only fair to be open and transparent she didn&#39;t think of her time when she was some kind of spandex fleshlight and Jake fucked her. Now she has to tell Emma about it but on the other hand she is kind of nervous to tell her that she was a sex toy and used for what a sex toy is designed for. &quot;OK, that&#39;s kind of embarrassing. The special feature was an opening on one side to make it possible that Jake could insert his penis and use me like... well, he used me like a sex toy. I guess you know what I mean?&quot; Emma isn&#39;t quite sure what Alice means, but she is really very open and progressive when it comes to sex and sex toys. &quot;Do you mean like a masturbator? Was that your own wish too? If not, then I think Jake went too far. But if it was your own wish, then I think it&#39;s great that you guys went for it like that. Have you done any more transformations like that?&quot; Alice wants to answer Emma&#39;s question, but she hopes that Jake will then talk for a while and answer Emma&#39;s questions, so that she can limit herself to adding her own point of view. &quot;Well, Jake proposed it and I found that this was an amazing idea. And I have to admit that I loved it to be nothing more than this little sex toy. We had my mind adapted to this form, you know? That was so liberating and relaxing. To be so completely focused on one single task.&quot; She grins while she adds, &quot;And my climax was great! I don&#39;t think I mentioned that we always set the sensitivity and pleasure levels pretty high during our transformations. When I was transformed into this simple cylinder, Jake was able to bring me to climax by squeezing me, kneading me, and stroking my seams. I can tell you, he did this really good. It&#39;s an incredible experience!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma listens to Alice and shakes her head in disbelieve. &quot;I have to say that I have to admit, I am surprised about this. Mike and I have never done anything like this before. And we never even talked about doing such a transformation. We are happy when he&#39;s transformed and can just be one or more inanimate objects. But this idea of getting orgasms or such is totally new to me.&quot; She looks at the bikini she wears and then back at Alice. &quot;But somehow this makes me curious. Would you both mind telling me more about your adventures? And don&#39;t hesitate to tell me all the details.&quot; Alice nods and Jake starts telling her everything, beginning with how he was a beach ball. &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t mind at all.&quot; says Jake’s voice from the smartphone. &quot;After Alice was this sex toy, I let myself be transformed into a beach ball. The device was set to keep my consciousness and my mind. So, I knew that I was being a beach ball. It was a bit like I was in a dream, but I was awake. I was still me and I was aware of being a pool toy, and it was pretty funny to have this awareness of being this.&quot; Jake pauses for a moment. &quot;But when Alice began to caress me and especially to run her fingers over my seams, it was suddenly very intense and very pleasurable. It felt so good. I didn&#39;t know what was going on. It was like she was massaging me. I loved it. I didn&#39;t want it to stop. And I had my first ever orgasm as an object when she massaged me.&quot; Emma looks at Jake in amazement. &quot;Oh my god, you guys are unbelievable.&quot; If Jake had a face right now, he&#39;d be grinning. &quot;How incredible do you think it was when Alice let the air out of me? Or when she blew me up again?&quot; Jake pauses, &quot;That was nothing, just wait and hear what we did next.&quot; Jake laughs again and continues his story. &quot;As Alice and I were discovering what the Transform-O-Matic could do, we had the idea that we could both be transformed into objects at the same time. So, the next step was for us to do some experiments on that.&quot; Emma raises an eyebrow. &quot;How that? Did you set a timer for your retransformation? And what exactly have you been and what exactly happened with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice grins. &quot;Oh, it was even more exciting than that. I have to tell you that I was a fuck machine, a dildo with a kind of tongue as a clitoris stimulator, which was mounted on a stable base and could perform thrusting movements on its own. Oh yes, and I had my own mind and consciousness while being it. And Jake was a mobile pussy, an artificial pussy on a frame with wheels that could position itself over me, over the dildo of the fuck machine. And the mobile pussy had the mind of such a thing, nothing more. In addition, it had a very sensitive opening and it had to make a counter-movement to that of my dildo so that the thrusts were as deep and hard as possible. The way it was set up, Jake&#39;s mind concentrated solely on being this mobile pussy. Jake, how was this from your perspective when you were the mobile pussy?&quot; she asks her husband who can only hear Emma like at the moment and has no idea what she looks like. Jake&#39;s voice sounds from the speaker on Alice&#39;s phone. &quot;It&#39;s hard for me to describe in words what it feels like to be an artificial pussy, Emma. But imagine being a machine, and everything you can focus on is pleasure. I just experienced the penetration of Alice and nothing else. It felt amazing, the way the dildo felt inside of me. The pleasure was intense and there was no other feeling I could focus on. When Alice inserted her dildo into me and thrust deep, it was the best experience I&#39;ve ever had. At least that&#39;s what I thought at that moment. I had no idea that I hadn&#39;t always been this mobile pussy. And when Alice used her tongue to lick my clitoris, I was hooked. And then we climaxed together over and over and that was like we&#39;ve never been as close to each other. When we were transformed back, I still can&#39;t stop thinking about how great it was to just feel the dildo thrust into me.&quot; Alice sighs. &quot;Oh, how could we tell you this. I really loved to be the fuck machine and to feel his body around my dildo. It was amazing to be so close to him.&quot; She takes a deep breath and smiles again, remembering the experience. &quot;And to be able to transform us back into our human form, we used Mental Link. When I decided it was time for us to transform back, I ordered the mobile pussy to move back into the range of the transformation beam and then used the Mental Link to command the Transform-O-Matic to transform it back into Jake. And he then had me transform back into my human form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice has to grin, &quot;I like the idea that when we are objects without our human mind, we shouldn&#39;t be called by our name. After all, in this moment, we are not a person, we are this thing. Nothing more. And somehow that&#39;s hot. Maybe because I know this is only temporary. That when the transformation ends, I&#39;m back to my own normal consciousness. And to feel that pleasure over and over and then be transformed back and to be completely normal again is something very exciting.&quot; Jake can feel Alice getting aroused by the recounting of this episode. Her vulva is swelling and becoming wet and he wishes she would rub her clitoris through his fabric. He is enjoying this very much.<br />
<br />
Emma&#39;s eyes are wide with fascination. &quot;Wow, that&#39;s unbelievable.&quot; Emma pauses, considering what Alice and Jake have told her, trying to process it. &quot;I think this was very brave of the two of you to have shared your stories with me. This is the first time I heard about other people being transformed to feel pleasure. This is incredible to me. And that you really gave this a chance and enjoyed this so much. I can imagine, that was very special. Mike and I have never really thought about using the Transform-O-Matic in a way that we could both get some orgasms or whatever.&quot; Alice giggles. &quot;Well, the next transformation we tried together, after the fuck machine, was my transformation into that game console.&quot; &quot;What happened there?&quot; Emma asks, very curious. &quot;Oh, well, I was a simple automaton, something you could hold in your hands with a screen on the front. And on my screen was like a simple sliding puzzle game. You know where you have to move the puzzle pieces around until you get a complete picture? On my screen it was always a picture of me. Even moving a puzzle piece gave me pleasure. And that pleasure was the only thing that was in the circuits that formed my mind, there was nothing else. Not the slightest thought or thing or anything else. And that was exactly what I wanted it to be, what I wanted to be when I was the game console. Jake had to solve this puzzle within a time limit to make me orgasm and he was only allowed to transform me back into Alice when I had orgasmed three times in a row.&quot; Emma looks at Alice and then at the swimsuit and nods. &quot;Wow, so you just wanted to be an automaton that feels pleasure and nothing else? I mean, I would have thought it would be a bit boring to be an automaton that does nothing else.&quot; She grins at Jake&#39;s fabric, but then she gets more and more curious. &quot;Wait, Alice? Were you a game console and nothing else? No awareness of being a game console?&quot; Alice takes a deep breath and pauses to think. She smiles, a little embarrassed. &quot;Well, I wanted to be nothing more than that and therefore my mind was totally reduced and there was nothing except for feeling pleasure. I didn&#39;t have a personality or feelings or the like. I was only that, my body transformed, and nothing more. So, the awareness that I have been a game console came only after the transformation back to myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake is really enjoying Alice&#39;s growing arousal. Her hard nipples poke his fabric and he feels how her pussy swells and gets wet. She is already wetting his crotch lining. Alice looks down at Jake&#39;s fabric and grins. &quot;Oh Jake, can you feel everything? Can you feel how much I love wearing you?&quot; &quot;Oh yes, I feel everything.&quot; Jake&#39;s voice is a bit higher-pitched now because of his excitement. &quot;It feels amazing to be worn by you, and I can&#39;t get enough of your arousal. I can even feel your breath and your heartbeat. It&#39;s just great.&quot; Alice takes a deep breath and holds Emma&#39;s eyes for a moment. Then she turns away, a bit embarrassed. &quot;Yeah, Jake really likes it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pauses again and then continues, &quot;After my transformation into a game console, we decided to let Jake have a try.&quot; They hear Jake&#39;s voice coming from the smartphone lying on the towel between Emma and Alice. &quot;What exactly was I transformed into? I want to know what Emma thinks I was.&quot; Jake sounds curious and a bit nervous about what she might have to say. &quot;Jake, I have no idea. Please, tell me. I want to know what kind of object you were after Alice was this game console.&quot; &quot;Emma, that was something I really wanted to try out.&quot; Alice&#39;s eyes shine and she really would want to start playing with her breasts, squeezing and stroking them and massaging them through the spandex. &quot;I think he really likes it, that I wear him.&quot; Jake laughs as he can feel Alice&#39;s pussy getting more wet, he can feel how wet her vulva is getting through his spandex. &quot;I like the way you&#39;re wearing me and how it feels to be stretched over you and hugging you so closely. And maybe you might want to do some dirty things with me?&quot; Jake teases Alice lovingly.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Emma has no idea what object Jake was after Alice was an orgasming game console. &quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t know. Maybe some kind of tool? Maybe Alice used you to repair a dripping faucet or some such? Or something for household and work? Oh, I can&#39;t wait to hear what you were!&quot; Jake laughs again. &quot;No, no. It was nothing like this. I was Alice&#39;s sports wear, her leggings and tight top. You know, I was split into two parts. Like Mike is split into the bikini top and bikini bottom. You see?&quot; Alice laughs out loud when she sees Emma&#39;s look, a mixture between confusion and amusement. &quot;Oh, I think that was too far fetched, my lovely swimsuit.&quot; Emma blushes a bit, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s right. But somehow... I have to confess that I like to watch Mike being transformed by the Transform-O-Matic. This triggers some very special feelings in me. And seeing him splitting in several objects is even more... special... If you know what I mean?&quot; Alice&#39;s eyes shine and she puts her hand on her stomach to rub Jake a little bit at least there. Jake would really want her to masturbate through him right away but he understands that Alice can&#39;t do this in public. Instead he continues to tell Emma about his time as Alice&#39;s sports wear, the feeling to be a tight fitting pair of leggings and a top. Alice gets more excited and her breath gets faster but she tries to hide her arousal. &quot;And did you keep your mind? Did you notice being split into two parts?&quot; Emma wants to know. Jake answers her, &quot;Oh, I was totally aware when the Transform-O-Matic converted my legs and hips into a pair of sports tights and it was strange to feel it as a part of me and see it was separated from my upper body. But my consciousness didn&#39;t last long from that point on. Soon after my upper half became Alice&#39;s gym top, my mind turned into nothing more than the mind of sports wear. I had a single consciousness, one mind, even when I was made up of two separate parts. That means I was nothing more than her sports wear.&quot; &quot;Wait, really nothing? I mean, did you feel nothing but the way how it felt to be spandex, your new fabric?&quot; Emma is more and more amazed. Jake continues with his story. &quot;Well, it was not exactly that. It was not boring because the pleasure was incredible and I was feeling every touch. My mind didn&#39;t think about anything else. There was just me being spandex and hugging Alice. I had a lot of fun being nothing more than this. It was great, and maybe it was similar to the feeling of being a bikini.&quot; He pauses for a moment, thinking about the comparison of being spandex sports wear and being a bikini. &quot;And I can&#39;t really describe what it felt like, because I just had the feeling of being spandex. Like my mind had always been this way, but I was still conscious, only conscious as sports wear. And with Mental Link I could hear what Alice was saying and talk to her. But the main part was to feel. I think I could get used to that really easily.&quot; Alice laughs a little at Jake&#39;s comparison between him being two sports wear items and Emma&#39;s bikini. &quot;So you really were happy with being her sports wear? You had no other thoughts and you weren&#39;t frustrated about it?&quot; Emma can&#39;t help but be amazed and curious at the way Jake describes his experience being Alice&#39;s clothes. It is so different to what she&#39;s experienced with Mike. Jake&#39;s voice is happy and relaxed, even excited to talk about what he has gone through. &quot;Oh yes. I love the feeling of being her sports wear. It&#39;s just so... I don&#39;t know, so freeing. There&#39;s no sense of human self or identity, and nothing to focus on but being her sports wear, her body&#39;s second layer. I really like it. It&#39;s the greatest thing I&#39;ve ever experienced in my life.&quot; Alice laughs out loud when she hears Jake&#39;s words. &quot;Oh, my love, I think you can&#39;t really describe what you mean, can you? But I can tell, it feels amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma smiles, she really likes this conversation, it&#39;s a bit weird to talk to someone who is a swimsuit at this moment. She hears about clothes that have a mind that can and want to focus only on being a piece of clothing. She thinks of a bikini top and a bikini bottom, something she wears when she goes to the beach or the pool, or leggings that she could wear at home, completely normal, everyday clothes and at the same time, something that is completely aware of what it is because it is just what it is. And she thinks of Mike, who could be that clothing that is aware of itself and could communicate with her. And maybe could experience pleasure. And maybe she might also try this and let Mike transform her into some inanimate but sentient object. Emma decides to ask again exactly whether Jake can also experience pleasure when he is made out of fabric and worn by Alice. But before she can ask, Alice speaks. Alice has to admit that she wants to know if it would be a worthwhile adventure for Emma and Mike to turn him into a sentient object and try all sorts of things. &quot;Emma, would you want Mike to be one or more pieces of clothing with a mind? And what do you think Mike would think about that?&quot; She looks at the bikini, somehow expecting the answer to come from the fabric. Emma takes a deep breath and looks down at herself. &quot;That is a hard decision. But I think if I could experience what I had just heard about and hear what he can think about all this and be aware, he might give it a try. So, why shouldn&#39;t I let him experience all of this? I just... I think this is something for our relationship but I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s willing to give up this peace of having no mind and no worries. This is what he said why he always wants to be just objects without a mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice nods and smiles, she understands what Emma means and why Mike would have this attitude. &quot;Yes, I know. But at least you know you have an option if he would like it. Or do you want to know more about this from him? I mean, as long as you have the option, I wouldn&#39;t give it up.&quot; Alice looks down to the ground. &quot;Jake, do you want to tell Emma how much we both love these kind of transformations?&quot; Jake&#39;s voice sounds happy and full of love and tenderness for Alice. &quot;Emma, you really can&#39;t imagine how great it feels. Alice, when she wore me, I could really feel her in a very, very, intimate way. And to feel her breathing in me and her heartbeat, that is always incredible.&quot; Emma hears the love and passion in Jake&#39;s voice. &quot;OK, I can imagine what that would feel like if Mike and I tried that, but it&#39;s also a bit scary. I have no idea what the consequences could be.&quot; Alice and Jake know how much they both would love to make Emma try something new. Jake continues his explanation. &quot;When Alice put me on and began to caress me, it felt like a massaging, a kneading, a squeezing and an exciting, pleasant stretching all at once. I can tell you, this is the best way for someone to feel close to each other. To experience this again and again, to experience an incredible amount of pleasure and orgasms together with the person who wears you, and then, when one is transformed back, everything is normal again.&quot; Alice can feel Jake&#39;s excitement building up more and more. He&#39;s enjoying this and so is she. &quot;Yes, Emma, he&#39;s right, I&#39;d love that you can experience this and to find out how you&#39;d like it. And even if Mike doesn&#39;t want to try this, we&#39;re really happy that you have asked so many questions and that you were so open and honest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice looks into Emma&#39;s eyes again, and smiles. &quot;Oh yes, and I think I want to tell you about our last transformation before Jake became my swimsuit. It was a whole night long and Jake was a teddy bear and I was a unicorn plushy and we cuddled and snuggled a lot. I mean, it was just incredible, so good, we didn&#39;t need to have sex, not for this night. It was just the two of us in the form of cuddly toys.&quot; Jake continues his story with the teddy bear and how Alice nuzzled against him and his fur. How he loved feeling her body and the softness of her mane and tail on his face and chest and he could feel her stroking his fur. &quot;And when I snuggled against her, I could hear her inner mechanism and her pump and I could even feel when the pump started to work.&quot; Emma wonders, &quot;Pump? In a plushy? Why did Alice have a pump as this unicorn? Did you have a pump too? And no sex? That&#39;s some kind of unusual I must say.&quot; Jake can hear the curiosity in Emma&#39;s voice. &quot;Well, as plushies we had no sex, no genitalia. There was no possibility to have sex. It was like this because we didn&#39;t want to have sex in that form. The experience of being plushies was enough to bring us pleasure.&quot; Alice has to grin again and continues. &quot;And the pump was part of our pneumatic system. It&#39;s like in a hydraulic or a car wash system, it provides pressure in the system. Actually we were little robots in our plush forms with a pneumatic system that could move our limbs.&quot; Emma looks down at the bottom part of Mike who has no mind and therefore Mental Link would be useless right now. But she has no problem imagining herself as a plush toy with a pneumatic system that could move its limbs. Emma is very curious why Alice and Jake had chosen this kind of being hybrids between plush toy and robot. &quot;Why did you want to be robots with plush or fur? Why weren&#39;t you just plushies?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Alice was actually so engrossed in the conversation and her descriptions that her hand slipped a little further towards her crotch, but also stopped stroking herself subtly. Only her fingertips still make a kind of tiny circular movement. &quot;That was simply so that we could move. The Transform-O-Matic can only create what actually works. At least that&#39;s what it says in the manual. And because a plushy is just plush with a soft filling, it normally can&#39;t move. So having ourselves transformed into little robots with plush covers and thick padding was our trick to get around this limitation. We had electronic components, like our control system, a few pneumatic cylinders that moved us, this already mentioned pump and a battery.&quot; Jake&#39;s voice laughs from the smartphone speaker. &quot;Oh yes, the batteries! They caused a few funny situations at the end!&quot; Alice giggles. &quot;Yes, when they started to get drained, we noticed that our pumps couldn&#39;t generate enough air pressure to move our limbs properly anymore. We couldn&#39;t get up from the bed anymore, and when we tried, we would just fall down again. That was so ridiculous! And our movements got slower and more sluggish, and finally, we couldn&#39;t move anymore, we couldn&#39;t even get our arms and legs to lift properly.&quot; Emma has to giggle a little at the image of two plushies with exhausted batteries who couldn&#39;t move. &quot;OK, but that wasn&#39;t really an issue. We were still within the reach of the Transform-O-Matic&#39;s beam and we used Mental Link to activate the retransformation. Just like we had planned it. All in all this was a very cuddly night and a funny awakening. It was quite an adventure!&quot; Jake adds, &quot;Yes, being able to use Mental Link to send commands to the Transform-O-Matic is a really nice feature. But can you imagine Alice as a plush unicorn and she kept falling down instead of standing on all fours? She was so cute!&quot; Jake and Emma laugh out loud. Alice joins in as she giggles at the image of a plushy unicorn falling over again and again, trying to stand on her four legs.</p>
