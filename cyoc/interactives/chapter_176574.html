<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You open the bag and the first thing that you see is two blue folders. &quot;That&#39;s odd,  what are these?&quot; You hold them up and Wendy claps. <br />
&quot;That&#39;s it,  that&#39;s your contract.&quot; You set them aside.  You see your shoes,  pants,  and shirt that you wore to the pool. And under that is the black thong suit that you put in. A little tingle in your nipples sound of just looking at it. You close up the bag without taking anything out and put it in the dresser. You&#39;re not even a little ready to change back yet.  Still so much to try out. <br />
You pick up the folders and bring them to the eat in island in the kitchen. One is labeled &quot;Wendy&quot; and the other is labeled Julia. &quot;Uh, there&#39;s two of them.  And yous has quotes around the name and mine says Julia. Maybe they were confused on what&#39;s going on as far as who got the modifications.   You did say only one modification is allowed right?&quot;  <br />
&quot;Yeah,  but since we are VERY happy with your results I guess we&#39;ll just have to come back some other time to get mine.  Jen said that after you&#39;ve been once it&#39;s easier to get to come back.&quot; <br />
You both open your folders.  There is the same cover sheet in the left and right pocket. <br />
&quot;TERMS.  One modification is allowed per visit to Pleasure Island.  Once the contract is completed no further modifications are allowed. If the party so desires additional trips may be made to Pleasure Island in which additional modifications may be made to the previous contracted form or an additional form may be contracted. The original form may be attained by placing the attire that was written directly prior to initial modification of the contracted form on the contracted person&#39;s body to which it was originally contracted to.  To enter the contracted form the contracted person must place the attire that was originally provided by Pleasure Island personnel that initiated the change to the contracted form. <br />
<br />
Should the contracted firm differ greatly from the contracted person&#39;s original form, then identification and legal records will be provided to match the contracted form.  The include,  but may not be limited to education records equal to the education received within the original form,  birth certificate that reflects the age of the contracted form, drivers license,  and trade certificates and licenses as attained within the original form.  If the contracted form is used as the primary form regardless of the circumstance, voluntary,  or involuntary nature of the contracted form becoming the primary form, then the contracted person shall not be provided employment outside of Pleasure Island. <br />
<br />
If the contracted person arrived to Pleasure Island with a spouse,  or person that is reasonably considered a person with interest in the matter by the way of sexual interest in the contracted form, then that person is hereby named the spouse of the contracted person within.   Should the contracted person consent,  then the spouse may complete Annex A to the contact in which the contracted firm shall exhibit the appearance and behaviors indicated herein while in proximity of said spouse.   If more than one spouse is present at the time of contract completion,  then additional annexes shall be incorporated.  In the case of conflicting appearances and behaviors while multiple spouses are present with the contracted person at the same time,  then priority shall be given based on appendix alphabetical order. <br />
<br />
All changes shall be final upon confirmation of the contract. The contract and the contracted form are non-transferable and non refundable.   Loss of attire capable of entering the contracted form or original form are unable to be replaced.  All contracts must be finalized and confirmed prior to departing Pleasure Island.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need more wine.&quot; You both say. After another glass and talking about the terms you both realize that there is actual contract.  Just the two copies of the terms. <br />
&quot;Look,  there is a sheet of paper behind the terms,&quot; she says as she pulls it free. &quot;It has a contract number and a web address. Let&#39;s go look at our contract for your sexiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, so since it has the spouse annex where I change when we&#39;re together.... Is there anything I should worry about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If there is, then you&#39;ll find out after we finalize it.&quot; That devious smile is back.  &quot;Relax,  I pretty much designed your &quot;contracted form&quot;, by the way,  your Julia when you&#39;re this sexy,  so what else would I change.  I mean maybe make you wear a collar and heels any time that we&#39;re together.  Oh and mandatory 69&#39;ing.  Oh,  I think i need to take some time to think this over.   I mean the power!&quot;<br />
<br />
You come over and give her a kiss. &quot;With great power comes great responsibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.  I tell you what,  I&#39;ll be &quot;responsible&quot; with the spouse portion.  Actually,  we make an agreement now since next time we come, and we are coming back, I&#39;ll be going through the modifications.  The spouse&#39;s stipulations when we are in each other&#39;s presence will only take effect while we are alone or engaged in sexual acts. Fair enough?&quot; You begin to agree, but she goes on,  &quot;and the spouse&#39;s part will be a secret only revealed as they happen. That way there is still some surprises for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can live with that,&quot; you tell her. &quot;Shall we go find a computer to look up the contract?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are two computers in our lab through that door.&quot;  You go and open the door and sure enough, there are two monitors facing each other like they are playing battleship.<br />
<br />
&quot;How big is this place? Why don&#39;t we just move in?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looks at you with a twinkle,  &quot;Don&#39;t threaten me with a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, well shall we start?&quot; You sit at one of the systems and she pulls the chair from the other to sit next to you.  &quot;Hey,  I thought we were going to go through each part as a surprise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,  the spouse part was going to be a surprise.  Let&#39;s face it, you know your way around the female body,  but your not even a full day into the female body. Do you know how to put in a tampon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hell no. That&#39;s not a part of this is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,  let me help you through. Besides in a few months when we can come back here,  we&#39;ll both know what to look for in a contract for me.&quot; She bats her eyes and you know she is going to get her way on this one. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,  I might need some help with some semantics for this.&quot; You glance at the system for the power button to fire it, but there is no PC or laptop.  Everything is wireless,  even the monitors.  The monitors don&#39;t even have power running to them.   So you wiggle the mouse instead. <br />
<br />
The monitor comes to life displaying the Pleasure Island home screen.  There is a picture of a very happy looking couple with a tall black man dressed in a suit and tie and a woman in a power suit.  It morphs to the next image and the man is in a Hawaiian shirt and the woman is a coconut bra and and grass skirt. It morphs again and the man is shorter and less muscular with a slightly lighter complexion wearing eye liner a dog collar and leather shirt and pants and the woman is taller wearing a leather corset, mini skirt, and tall stelletto heels.  <br />
<br />
Again it morphs now the man is a dark skinned tall woman wearing a power suit and the woman is a shorter white man wearing the suit and tie that the first image was wearing.   It continues through the image changes that the previous series had gone through. This time though after the leather clad image they morph again and the tall man has partial images of a wolf and the woman in partially rabbit.   It goes through the series showing varies animals and then morphs back to the original image. At the bottom of the image is the line,  &quot;At Pleasure Island you can be whoever you are and enjoy yourself with no taboos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; you both mutter. &quot;So I guess nothing is of the table.   Gender,  race,  and even species,&quot; you continue the thought. The species thing is of the table for you,  but all of the rest are very interesting. But Julia was designed pretty much by Wendy and this body was already amazing. No need for any changes. <br />
<br />
You look over the site and there are drop downs for cuisine,  parks,  entertainment,  physical body mods,  and finally you see contract management.  You click on that one and a pop up box asks for your contract number.   Wendy reads the 22 digit alpha numeric code as you fill it in. <br />
<br />
The contract is populated.  <br />
&quot;<br />
1 Contract Terms:<br />
1A Read and Accepted (already checked)<br />
1B Current Revisions: Spouse Term - Amended with the following statement: All spouse amendments created by both parties as they each fill the role of spouse on each other&#39;s primary and alternate form contract shall have sole responsibility for including any charges to the primary contract person&#39;s form as they should choose with the specific limitation that such changes dictated shall only occur while the primary contracted person is alone with said spouse or engaged in sexual activities. <br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,  we just agreed to that between the two of us,&quot; you say. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well,  I suppose it makes sense that it would have to be included in here otherwise your Julia form would never know when to put the slut collar and heels on you.&quot; She&#39;s teasing you,  but has no idea how much you already love being her slut. <br />
<br />
&quot;But how did it know?&quot; you ask conspiratorial.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,  it took your dick away and gave you a pussy and magnificent tits.  Maybe we should just have a bit of faith here.&quot;  Hard to argue that one,  so you move onward. <br />
<br />
