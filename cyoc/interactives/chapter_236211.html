<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the warmth of their laughter started to settle, the bedroom door creaked open, and Jesse’s younger brother peeked his head in. He had the same big, curious eyes Jesse remembered, but his hair was longer now, flowing past his shoulders. He was still dressed in his white unicorn t-shirt from earlier, but he had swapped into pink shorts for bedtime.<br />
<br />
“Sam! Can you come play with me before bed? Like last time?” the young boy asked, his voice soft and expectant, clutching a stuffed unicorn under his arm.<br />
<br />
Sam glanced at Jesse, then back at his brother, his smile warm but apologetic. “Sorry, Soph. I’m sticking with your brother tonight.”<br />
<br />
The young boy’s face dropped a little, his lower lip pushing out into a small pout, but before Jesse could feel the awkwardness settle in, he made a decision. As much as he wanted to hide in his room and avoid everything new and confusing, he needed to understand this world, and more importantly, this new version of his family, including his younger brother who now went by Soph—Sophia?<br />
<br />
“Actually, I’ll come.” Jesse said, surprising himself. “I can play for a bit.”<br />
<br />
Sophia’s face lit up instantly, his pout forgotten. “Really? Yay! Come on!” he squealed, darting back toward his room.<br />
<br />
Sam raised an eyebrow at Jesse, clearly impressed. “You sure?”<br />
<br />
Jesse shrugged, sliding off the bed. “Yeah, I wanna… get to know him better.”<br />
<br />
Sam smiled softly, standing up as well. “Alright, let’s do it then.”<br />
<br />
They followed Sophia down the hall and into his room, which was a pastel explosion of colors. There were dolls everywhere — some in elaborate dresses, others in casual outfits, and a few with tiny accessories like bags and shoes. A dollhouse sat in the corner, and the walls were decorated with posters of glittering cartoon characters and rainbows. It felt like a whole different universe compared to what Jesse’s brother’s room used to be.<br />
<br />
Sophia plopped down in the middle of the floor, already setting up a few of his favorite dolls. Sam took a seat beside him, already familiar with the routine, and Jesse joined in, sitting cross-legged on the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let’s play house!&quot; Sophia announced, his voice full of energy. He handed Jesse a doll, one of the ones with long blonde hair dressed in a pink sundress, while Sam got the mom figure, dressed in what looked like business attire.<br />
<br />
Jesse stared at the doll, a little unsure of what to do with it. He had no experience with this kind of play, and the weight of the situation felt heavier with each second. In his old life, his brother would have been all about action figures, toy cars, and building blocks. Now, everything was soft, bright, and delicate.<br />
<br />
“Okay.” Jesse said slowly, feeling a little out of place but determined to push through. “What do we do?”<br />
<br />
Sophia giggled, setting the scene. “You’re the dad,” he said to Jesse, “and Sam is the mom. And I’m the baby! We’re all going on a vacation, but we need to pack and get ready first.”<br />
<br />
Jesse blinked, still processing everything. He examined the doll in his hands, trying to picture himself as this character. It was strange, playing a role so far removed from anything he used to do. But Sam, ever the easygoing one, took the lead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let’s see.” Sam said, making his doll walk across the floor to a toy suitcase. &quot;I’ll pack the clothes. Do we need to bring sunscreen, honey?&quot; he asked, glancing at Jesse with a playful smirk.<br />
<br />
Jesse rolled his eyes but smiled, holding the dad doll up. “Yes, definitely sunscreen.” he replied, trying to sound serious, but his voice wavered with amusement.<br />
<br />
Sophia giggled and moved his doll, the baby, around in circles. “I want my toys! Can I bring all my toys?”<br />
<br />
“No, sweetheart.” Jesse said in a mock-fatherly voice, getting into the role a bit more. “You can only bring one toy.”<br />
<br />
The three of them continued playing, with Sophia setting the scenes and Sam jumping in with playful mom jokes. As they played, Jesse couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of unfamiliarity with everything. The way Sophia talked, the types of stories he created for his dolls — all of it felt off to him. But at the same time, there was an innocence to it that softened the strangeness. His brother was happy, completely unaware of the confusion swirling in Jesse’s mind.<br />
<br />
Jesse watched as Sam seamlessly interacted with Sophia, knowing exactly what to say and how to play along. Sam had no trouble navigating this world, effortlessly participating in the game in a way that felt natural to him. Jesse, on the other hand, was still struggling to adjust.<br />
<br />
But he followed Sam’s lead, doing his best to participate and match the enthusiasm Sophia had. They pretended to pack for the trip and imagined all the places they were going. At one point, Sophia insisted they were heading to a magical island where unicorns lived, and Jesse couldn’t help but laugh as Sam made the mom doll roll her eyes in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“You really think unicorns exist?” Sam’s mom doll asked with exaggerated skepticism.<br />
<br />
“Yes!” Sophia shouted, making his baby doll hop up and down excitedly. “And I’m going to ride one!”<br />
<br />
For the next half hour, they played out the trip—pretending to fly on a plane, arrive at a beachside resort, and go on all sorts of wild adventures, with Sophia&#39;s imagination steering the story. Jesse nodded along, adding his own input when he could, though he still felt like a fish out of water.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Sophia’s excitement started to wane, and his yawns became more frequent. “Okay, I think it’s bedtime for the baby.” Sam said, gently guiding the game toward a conclusion.<br />
<br />
Sophia pouted but didn’t protest too much. “Fine.” he mumbled sleepily, setting his doll aside and rubbing his eyes.<br />
<br />
Jesse felt a strange sense of relief. As much as he wanted to bond with him, the whole experience had been exhausting. He wasn’t used to these new social dynamics yet — not by a long shot.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for playing with me, Jess.” Sophia said, looking up at him with a big smile. “You’re the best big brother ever.”<br />
<br />
Jesse’s heart tightened. The words stung in a strange way, reminding him of everything that had changed. But he forced a smile, giving a small nod. “Yeah… anytime, Soph.”<br />
<br />
As they tucked the dolls away and headed back to Jesse’s room, Sam let out a playful groan. “Ugh, I’m exhausted from that vacation. Who knew playing house could be so much work?”<br />
<br />
Jesse chuckled, flopping back onto his bed. “Yeah, tell me about it.”<br />
<br />
Sam stretched, rolling his shoulders as he headed toward the bathroom. “Mind if I take a quick shower before bed?” he asked casually.<br />
<br />
Jesse shook his head. “Yeah, go ahead.”<br />
<br />
Before disappearing into the bathroom, Sam paused at Jesse’s open closet. &quot;Mind if I just grab something?&quot; he asked casually, glancing over the options.<br />
<br />
Jesse hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “Yeah, sure.” Sam had never borrowed clothes from him before in their old reality, or any other of his friends, for that matter. But here, it seemed completely normal.<br />
<br />
Sam rummaged through the neatly folded clothes, quickly pulling out a pair of underwear and an oversized t-shirt with a colorful graphic print that Jesse would never have imagined owning before today. He held it up with a grin. &quot;This’ll work.&quot; he said, and then disappeared into the bathroom, leaving Jesse alone with his thoughts. <br />
<br />
Jesse stood in front of the vanity, feeling an odd mix of detachment and anxiety as he stared at the reflection in the mirror. His long hair fell messily over his shoulders, and the remnants of the makeup he&#39;d worn all day had begun to smudge. He sat down in front of it, staring at the array of makeup products spread across the surface. It was clear he’d spent a lot of time getting ready this morning in this reality — everything was organized, from the foundation to the brushes and palettes.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Jesse grabbed a makeup wipe and began wiping off the remnants of his makeup, trying to be as gentle as possible. As the colors faded from his face, he caught glimpses of the &quot;old&quot; him beneath the layers, though it still wasn’t quite the face he remembered. The new reality had given him softer features, a sharper jawline, and high cheekbones that accentuated everything, even when bare-faced.<br />
<br />
He sighed, tossing the used wipe into the trash, and stared at himself once again. Even without makeup, the reflection didn’t align with his internal sense of self. It was like he was trapped in a body that wasn’t his own — or at least, not the one he knew. <br />
<br />
Jesse fiddled with the makeup products absentmindedly, feeling the heaviness of the day wash over him again. His head buzzed with all the interactions he&#39;d had, the gender roles, the social expectations, and how every familiar face now carried some new version of themselves. It was overwhelming.<br />
<br />
The door to the bathroom cracked open, and Sam reappeared, towel-drying his hair. He was now dressed in the oversized shirt and underwear he had picked out, moving with a casual ease that Jesse couldn&#39;t help but envy. It was like nothing had changed for Sam; he was comfortable in this world, and even in Jesse’s clothes. “Feel better?” he asked, noticing Jesse staring blankly into the mirror.<br />
<br />
Jesse gave a weak nod. “Yeah… I guess. Just, y’know… everything.” He glanced at Sam through the mirror, his voice soft. “This feels so weird, even now.”<br />
<br />
Sam walked over and leaned against the vanity next to Jesse, giving him a sympathetic smile. “I know it’s a lot, but you’re doing great, really. We’ll get through this, okay?”<br />
<br />
Jesse nodded again, though he wasn’t sure how true that felt. As he stood up from the vanity, feeling a bit more collected after wiping off his makeup, he realized he should probably grab pillows and blankets for Sam to sleep in the living room. He didn’t feel quite ready to have someone so close when his mind was still reeling from the day&#39;s events.<br />
<br />
“I’ll go grab some stuff for you to sleep on the couch.” Jesse muttered, heading toward the door.<br />
<br />
But Sam tilted his head, looking genuinely confused. “The couch? Dude, what are you talking about? We’ve always just shared your bed when I stayed over.”<br />
<br />
Jesse paused mid-step, his hand on the doorframe, and turned back around slowly. “Wait… what?”<br />
<br />
Sam shrugged, plopping down on Jesse’s bed like it was the most natural thing in the world. “Yeah, it’s no big deal. I mean, we’ve been doing it for years, right?” He stretched out, making himself comfortable. “Remember that time we stayed up all night watching those dumb rom-coms? You couldn’t stop talking about how cringey they were, but I knew you secretly liked them.”<br />
<br />
Jesse’s heart skipped a beat. In his old reality, the idea of sharing a bed with Sam would have been... weird. It wasn’t something they ever did. They’d either crash on couches or keep things distant, the way teenage boys usually do. But here, everything was different.<br />
<br />
He looked at Sam sprawled across his bed, completely at ease, and felt a strange mix of emotions. Part of him was touched by how comfortable Sam was with him, but another part felt intensely awkward. Could he really just climb into bed next to Sam like it was nothing?<br />
<br />
Jesse hesitated, unsure of how to respond. “Uh… I don’t know. I just figured maybe you’d want your own space or something.”<br />
<br />
Sam laughed softly, patting the spot next to him. “Jess, you’re being weird. It’s no big deal, I promise. Besides, your bed is way more comfortable than the couch.”<br />
<br />
Jesse felt his face flush slightly. “Yeah… I guess.” He stood there for a moment longer, debating whether to push back or go along with it. But the last thing he wanted to do was make Sam uncomfortable, especially when Sam had been so patient and supportive the whole day. Finally, Jesse sighed and gave in. “Alright, fine.”<br />
<br />
Jesse sighed once more, knowing that he needed to change into something more comfortable if he was going to survive this awkward sleepover situation. He headed to his closet, feeling Sam&#39;s curious gaze on him. Pulling open the door, Jesse was greeted by an array of clothes that made his stomach flip — nothing but feminine styles, delicate fabrics, and colorful designs. He rifled through the hangers and storage drawers quickly, trying to find something that felt neutral enough for him to wear without feeling too out of place. <br />
<br />
Finally, he settled on a pair of soft pink sleep shorts and a loose, oversized t-shirt that read &quot;Good Vibes&quot; across the front. It wasn&#39;t exactly what he would have worn in his old life, but it was the least flashy option he could find. As he held them up, he felt a pang of discomfort, remembering how his old sleep attire was just plain boxers and an old t-shirt.<br />
<br />
With no better options, Jesse pulled off his shirt, feeling Sam glance away to give him some privacy. His body felt unfamiliar to him now, the changes still something he hadn’t quite accepted. He quickly swapped his shirt for the oversized one, the fabric soft against his skin. Then, after hesitating for a moment, he slipped off his jean shorts and changed into the pink sleep shorts. They were far too snug for his liking, hugging his legs more than he was used to, but at least they were comfortable. He felt strange, self-conscious even, wearing something so different from what he would have worn in the past, but Sam didn’t seem to think twice about it.<br />
<br />
Jesse turned around, trying to act casual as he moved toward the bed, feeling slightly awkward as he climbed in next to Sam. The bed felt smaller than he remembered, or maybe it was just the closeness of the situation. He lay stiffly for a moment, his mind racing, before Sam rolled onto his side and gave him a teasing grin.<br />
<br />
“Relax. You’re acting like this is some big deal. It’s just me.”<br />
<br />
Jesse forced a chuckle, trying to shake off the tension. “Yeah, I know. It’s just… been a weird day, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
As Jesse settled back onto the bed, trying to get comfortable, he shifted awkwardly. The tightness around his chest hadn’t bothered him much throughout the day with everything else going on, but now that the day was winding down, he was growing increasingly aware of it. <br />
<br />
Sam glanced over and raised an eyebrow, noticing Jesse fidgeting. &quot;Aren&#39;t you gonna take your bra off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse froze for a moment, blinking in confusion. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam chuckled softly. &quot;Your bra, Jess. You usually take it off before bed. Doesn&#39;t it get uncomfortable?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse’s mind raced as he processed Sam’s words. The fact that he had been wearing a bra all day was something he had been actively trying to forget, but now that Sam mentioned it, the tight band and straps digging into his skin were impossible to ignore. His eyes flicked down toward his chest, realizing with an uncomfortable jolt that he could finally free himself from it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right… yeah.&quot; Jesse said awkwardly, his face flushing a little. Taking a deep breath, he slipped his hands under his oversized t-shirt, fumbling with the clasp at his back. <br />
<br />
It took him a moment to figure it out, but eventually, the straps loosened, and Jesse pulled the bra off beneath his shirt, quickly tossing it aside. The immediate relief was overwhelming, and he let out a small, involuntary sigh as the pressure around his chest disappeared.<br />
<br />
Sam, noticing Jesse&#39;s relief, grinned. &quot;See? So much better, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse nodded, still feeling a bit off balance. &quot;Yeah… definitely.&quot; he replied, trying to mask the strange mix of emotions swirling inside him. <br />
<br />
Sam nodded in understanding, then pulled out his phone, the familiar glow lighting up his face. “Want to watch something, or are you wiped?”<br />
<br />
Jesse glanced at his phone, not really in the mood for watching anything, but the comfort of routine — even in this new reality — was tempting. “Maybe we can watch something short.” he mumbled.<br />
<br />
Sam scrolled through a few options while Jesse stared at the ceiling, still processing everything. It was strange, but there was also something comforting about the way Sam acted like nothing was out of the ordinary. For all the confusion and upheaval, at least he still had this — a friendship that felt solid, even if everything else didn’t.</p>
