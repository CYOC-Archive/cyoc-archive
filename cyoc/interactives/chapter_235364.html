<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Things are spicing up now! Be warned, the next chapter goes from 0 to 100 so fast. Enjoy!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Manny and Theo, donning the costumes and bodies of Captain America and Thor, were strolling down the campus road that was bustling with college students. The two freshly-transformed hunks were surrounded by teens scouring the campus grounds in search of the next, coolest party to crash. The students’ costumes ranged from cheaply-made to barely-covered. A man wrapped in toilet paper was kissing a girl wearing nothing but a bra, miniskirt, and bunny ears. A jock with skin clumsily painted green was flexing his biceps and screaming “HULK OUT” to his friends as he downed beer after beer. The muffled thumping of club songs from an array of dorm room windows mixed together in one heart-pounding cacophony. Disco and strobe lights lit up the night sky, and the occasional firework exploded amongst the stars.<br />
<br />
The perfect night for a party.<br />
<br />
It was a new world for Manny and Theo. A world beyond their lonely dorm rooms and chess clubs and study groups and comic-cons. A world of freedom, wildness and, if all goes to plan, sex.<br />
<br />
And so far, Theo’s plan was working. With their helmets on, the other students around them were none the wiser. No one could see their faces, but no one was looking that high up their bodies. They both heard passing comments between student cliques, comments like:<br />
<br />
“Holy fuck, who are they?”<br />
“How big is that thing?!”<br />
“Damn, they’re hot as fuck.”<br />
<br />
Manny was walking awkwardly, trying to avoid looking at people in the eye. He wasn’t quite used to his new height or physique. His costume was a few sizes too tight, especially around the ass and thighs. It wasn’t a costume built for Captain America himself, and he could feel people staring at him, particularly at his crotch which showed off his larger, heftier bulge. <br />
<br />
Theo shoved Manny in the shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Dude! Those girls were totally checking us out! We are so gonna get laid tonight!”<br />
<br />
Unlike his shy friend, Theo had taken his new body in stride. He stomped with a puffed out chest and flexed triceps. His costume also looked too tight on him, but he embraced it, and his bulge was out in full view. He also carried a small brown bag around his broad shoulders and a heavy case of beer under one arm. He was loving the attention. He saw one girl checking him out and winked, flashing a seductive smile, to which the girl blushed, and Theo’s confidence grew. His bulge twitched.<br />
<br />
“Damn it feels good to be noticed. Tonight’s gonna be legendary!”<br />
<br />
He bellowed, reaching into his brown bag and pulling out a packet of Perfectionery. With a quick tug it opened and he ate the candies eagerly. Manny looked worried.<br />
<br />
“Slow down man, what if you take too many?”<br />
<br />
Theo scoffed in Thor’s voice; deep and commanding.<br />
<br />
“Nothing’s gonna happen. None of the forum threads said anything about it. Plus, they taste so good! Here…”<br />
<br />
He pulled another packet out of his bag and tossed it to Manny. <br />
<br />
“Eat ‘em. I’ll throw ‘em away otherwise. What could go wrong?”<br />
<br />
Manny shrugged and joined his friend as they wolfed down a packet each.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
They gobbled down a second packet each as they made their way to the house of Zeta Epsilon Chi. The house was off campus grounds. A quiet, suburban street filled with normal suburban houses. When they turned the corner, they could see the house from a distance. It was the only one with all of its lights on, and loud, bassy music shook its walls.<br />
<br />
Manny felt his heart pound out of his chest, and his body turn hot. Maybe it was the tightness of the costume, but he could feel his muscles tense. His forehead began to sweat. He turned to Theo, whose breathing was heavy.<br />
<br />
“Theo, I don’t feel so good.”<br />
<br />
Theo ignored him, adjusting the trousers of his costume which felt slightly tighter than before.<br />
<br />
“It’s just nerves Manny. We’re gonna have the best night of our lives, and it starts right here. If I don’t lose my virginity tonight, looking sexy as fuck, then I never will. Fuck…”<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to Manny, Theo grew a boner as they walked up the driveway to the front door of the frathouse. His bulge looked obvious, and he held the beer in front of his crotch to try and hide it, but he looked down and watched it grow a few more inches. He tried to adjust it, but felt a jolt of pleasure as he rubbed his hand along his shaft and he let out a slight moan. He tried to will his cock down as he pounded loudly on the door.<br />
<br />
Manny didn’t notice. He was having problems of his own. From under his helmet he heard the rustling of hair, and he swiped his face with his finger. Sure enough, stubble had sprouted on his cheeks and jaw. The hair reached down to his neck and adam’s apple, which grew as his voice became a slightly deeper version of Chris Evans’.<br />
<br />
“Something’s happening,” said Manny, “we are so much of that candy—“<br />
<br />
“Quit being a pussy. We made it this far,” said Theo, “I need this. HNNNG—!”<br />
<br />
Theo grunted as he grew a few inches taller, his body getting bigger under that tight costume. He once shared his height with Manny, but now stood over him. Theo’s muscles grew too, and he stood a night 6ft7; as tall as the door they were waiting at.. <br />
<br />
Manny watched, aghast, before shifting his eyes down to his friend’s bulge. He began to panic at the size of it. <br />
<br />
“Fuck, you’re still growing! We’re gonna get caught!” he said.<br />
<br />
“Just shut up,” sad Theo, “it’ll be fine.<br />
<br />
Manny clutched his neck as he suddenly felt a tingle across his body. Then, as quick as a flash, he felt his body grow a few inches as well, until he shared Theo’s height again. His costume hugged his muscles even tighter, and his helmet was starting to hurt on his head. He could feel his costume rustle as chest hair began to grow underneath it. He could smell his musk as it grew more potent. It was making him panic, and turning him on like crazy. It wasn’t long before he sported a cock as hard as Theo’s, only it looked more obvious in his costume.<br />
<br />
“Fuck,” said Manny, “that’s intense.”<br />
<br />
They could someone on the other side of the door twist the doorknob.<br />
<br />
“Relax! Play it cool!” said Theo.<br />
<br />
The door swung open.<br />
<br />
It was Zachariah.<br />
<br />
“What is it?” he asked.<br />
<br />
Manny’s cock throbbed at the sight of him. Zach was an adonis; his ripped body barely covered in a gladiator’s costume. Black curly hair fell perfectly in front of his eyes, and his lips shined with a fresh layer of lipgloss. His ensemble of a leather-armoured skirt, sandals, and red cape meant his chest was on full display, and it thick with muscle. Manny couldn’t look away.<br />
<br />
“Uh, hello?” said Zach, noticing Manny’s staring, “what’s up?”<br />
<br />
“We were just, ahhh…” Theo paused, feeling his cock grow another few inches, “we wanted to party.”<br />
<br />
“Who are you?” asked Zach.<br />
<br />
“He’s Captain America, and I’m Thor,” said Theo.<br />
<br />
Manny tensed his body. He could feel a surge of energy reach his ass which tingled. He nodded silently, clenching his fist as his asscheeks grew a few sizes bigger. Fighting the urge to moan or make any sound was a Herculean task.<br />
<br />
The air around Manny and Theo began to turn wavy. Invisible currents of hot air mixed with their musk radiated from their bodies outwards.<br />
<br />
Zach scanned them both as if they were lunatics and scoffed.<br />
<br />
“But who are you? We can’t just let in strangers now. Fuckin’ weirdos.”<br />
<br />
He was about to close the door on their faces, under the hot air reached his nose. He took in a deep breath of it as his eyes dilated. He smiled widely at the two.<br />
<br />
“Woah. You two can stay,” he said with glee.<br />
<br />
Zach gestured to the pair to enter the house. Theo sighed with relief as he walked in so quickly he almost hit his head on the doorframe. Manny followed behind, his cock throbbing under his costume. <br />
<br />
The inside of the house was just as expected; littered with beer bottles and red cups, with some decorations hung across the ceiling. Men of various sizes and statures all wore costumes that showed off their football-playing bodies. They were scattered across each of the house’s large rooms, but mainly congregated in the garden where the music was loudest.<br />
<br />
Manny took it all in; this new world. Zach suddenly stopped him in his tracks, leaned in, and sniffed Manny’s neck as if he was an addict getting a high.<br />
<br />
“You,” Zach said with a smile, “you’re coming with me.”<br />
<br />
He turned to Theo.<br />
<br />
“The dancefloor’s in the garden. Go nuts. Archie!”<br />
<br />
A tall man with broad shoulders and toned ass wearing a Black Panther costume held up his hand and approached Zach.<br />
<br />
“Yes King?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Check out the musk on this guy.”<br />
<br />
Zach pointed at Theo, who looked confused. Archie shrugged and peeled his mask off, revealing a strong jawline and shaved head. He gave Zach a look before approaching Theo and smelling him. The hot, wavy air flew into his nose, and he gasped as his eyes dilated. He looked up at the hulking Thor before him and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Holy fuck,” said Archie.<br />
<br />
“I know right. This one’s mine,” said Zach, pulling Manny closer to him.<br />
<br />
“Come with me, big boy,” said Archie, grabbing Thor’s hand and whisking him away to the dance floor. Theo dropped the beer in surprise, and Manny saw his friend’s bulge grow again, looking obscene as it bounced with Theo’s walk. When they were out of sight, Zach sniffed Manny’s neck again and smiled even wider.<br />
<br />
“Just you and me now,” he said.<br />
<br />
“But I—“<br />
<br />
Before Manny could protest Zach grabbed his hand and dragged him to the staircase. As they traversed the stairs, Manny grunted as he felt his cock grow. The costume was starting to dig into his skin. He needed to get out of it, and fast. Zach guided him up the stairs and down a narrow corridor, eventually reaching a worn door with “Zachariah” painted across it.<br />
<br />
“This is where the magic happens.”<br />
<br />
And he took Captain America inside.</p>
