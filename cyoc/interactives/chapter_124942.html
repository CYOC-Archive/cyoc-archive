<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jared heard Mrs. Thomason speak and laugh, but her words danced away in the air and were lost to him.<br />
<br />
He found himself wishing she would go away and just let him rest. Mitzi came over to her owner and received some pats on the head. &quot;That&#39;s a good girl, Mitzi,&quot; Mrs. Thomason told the dog. &quot;Let&#39;s hope that did the trick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mitzi didn&#39;t seem willing to trust to luck. She walked toward Jared, turned her rear to him, lifted her tail, and wagged it side to side to make sure he caught her scent.<br />
<br />
Oh no! Jared remembered the warning from Wepwawet. The more he surrendered to animal urges, the more he would become like the real Shaggy. He tried to ignore her, but she persisted in her behavior. Her scent brought his earlier excitement roaring back to the forefront of his brain. He got onto his feet and followed her to a mulched bed with various perennials and shrubs. He lifted a leg and marked several of the clumps of hosta plants with his urine. Mitzi squatted near the plant and added her own to the mix.<br />
<br />
Jared sniffed the dripping plant and felt the dog instincts rebound with a vengeance. He fought as hard as he could, but before he even realized it was happening he found himself mounting the slightly smaller chow for the third time. He even heard Mrs. Thomason laugh and comment on it. &quot;Third time&#39;s the charm,&quot; she muttered as she walked back into the house. &quot;Give you love-birds some privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared lost himself in the mating. He kept energetically thrusting. Mitzi whined excitedly but remained still and steadfast. The only thing that mattered was the sensations from his energetic actions. He forgot everything about being Jared as he felt his knot swell again, followed soon by an agonizingly swift ejaculation. He wished it could last forever. He was still numb from the intensity when he heard someone clear a throat.<br />
<br />
His return to some degree of awareness was one of utter humiliation. His father had returned and now watched as Jared and Mitzi remained locked together in the aftermath of their latest session. Jared groaned and tried to slide off, but he felt even more tied to the female dog than on the earlier occasions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill!&quot; Mrs. Thomason greeted Jared&#39;s father.  She laughed and added, &quot;I guess you can see our matchmaking&#39;s paid off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s father had no real interest in Mrs. Thomason&#39;s quaint attempt to anthropomorphize the behavior of Shaggy and Mitzi. Practical to the utmost, it was just sex. And he wished the sheepdog would hurry the process so he could take him and get home.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ve been going at it like rabbits!&quot; Mrs. Thomason proclaimed loudly. &quot;If this hasn&#39;t worked, it won&#39;t be for lack of trying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mitzi seemed to have gotten bored and wanted to wander, moving around much more freely than was comfortable for Jared. His gaze met his father&#39;s and, in a moment of desperation, barked for help. &quot;Dad, please,&quot; he barked. &quot;Just get me out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Five awkward minutes later, Jared finally found himself free. He felt his furry sheath engulf his member. He just wanted to go home. <br />
<br />
&quot;Home,&quot; he barked and looked up at dad, who bent toward him and attached a leash to his collar.<br />
<br />
He strained at once, being very impatient to abandon Mitzi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like a man,&quot; Mrs. Thomason huffed. &quot;Wham! Bam! Thank you, Ma&#39;am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared&#39;s father tried to maintain an aloof reserve. He gave a shaky laugh and said, &quot;Well, I will just take the scoundrel off your hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared wanted very much to tell... something... to his owner.<br />
<br />
He shook his shaggy head form side to side. &quot;Not owner. Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, boy,&quot; his father said. &quot;Let&#39;s get you home.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the way, Jared tugged mightily on the leash, wanting to investigate a flattened road-kill squirrel near the curb. The dead and very flat squirrel was covered with buzzing flies, but it smelled interesting to Jared. He would have wandered over and done more than sniff the putrid carcass if his dad hadn&#39;t been firm with the leash.<br />
<br />
Once they got out of immediate range of the powerful odor of dead squirrel, Jared tried again. He needed to... his dog&#39;s instinct warred with his need to put simple words together in his thoughts.<br />
<br />
He needed to go back and get that squirrel. He did turn his head and glance back in the direction, but his father gave one sharp tug and the sheepdog fell, however reluctantly, into line.<br />
<br />
When they reached home, they found the impostor, shirtless, shooting hoops at the goal on the pole at the top of the driveway. Jared watched the impostor&#39;s athletic performance and saw the faker stretch muscles and tendons as he tossed the ball. The sweaty impostor greeted them with a &quot;Hey, dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, son,&quot; Dad said.<br />
<br />
Jared whimpered. Dad was his owner... no, wait... Dad was his dad, not the impostor&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;I noticed Shaggy wasn&#39;t here when I got home from school,&quot; the impostor said. <br />
<br />
Dad chuckled. &quot;Our very own Shaggy has been asked to play the stud,&quot; Dad explained and told the impostor the story of the request by the Thomasons to mate Shaggy and Mitzi.<br />
<br />
The impostor leaned in front of Jared&#39;s face. The sheepdog&#39;s nostrils detected the masculine smells coming from his own former body. &quot;Is that so?&quot; The impostor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand he performed above and beyond the call of duty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shaggy, you dog,&quot; the impostor exclaimed in a too loud voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not dog,&quot; Jared whimpered and whined. &quot;Not dog!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let me fasten Shaggy back to the lead,&quot; the impostor volunteered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, son,&quot; Dad said again, frustrating the sheepdog again.<br />
<br />
The impostor walked Shaggy into the yard and attached the collar back to the lead.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do look a little dumber,&quot; the impostor evaluated Jared as he stared at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not dumb,&quot; Jared growled. &quot;Not dog!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared longed to have his body back, gazing at the bare skin the impostor displayed for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you do,&quot; the impostor said. &quot;But every thing you do is making it a virtual certainty that we&#39;re going to stay this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared whimpered, but not because of the impostor&#39;s taunts. The breeze had changed, and Mitzi&#39;s powerful scent proved just as powerful despite the fact the two houses were several blocks apart.<br />
<br />
The impostor recognized something of what was going on and smiled. <br />
<br />
For Jared, it would be a long night.</p>
