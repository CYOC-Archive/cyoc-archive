<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie pleaded with Esme, her voice filled with desperation. &quot;Please, Esme! We came to you for help, and we&#39;re sorry if we upset you. But John needs your assistance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Esme took a breath and looked directly at Katie.  &quot;Katie, you have been kind, understanding, and maintained an open mind since the moment you first walked into my shop yesterday.  I even threw in a few free items for you in appreciation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled and glanced at John who was still upset.  &quot;So, you&#39;ll give him one more chance?&quot;<br />
<br />
Esme lowered her head and paused for a moment.  She looked up at John.  &quot;Almost immediately after you walked into this store yesterday, you&#39;ve mocked me, eschewed my assistance, and went against my advice of trying a suit.  I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t expect people to have doubts about the products we sell here, but even today after you&#39;ve seen the wonders of what we&#39;re offering, you were impatient, not forthcoming about your issue, and when I had explained that it would likely take several tries to revert your girlfriend&#39;s arms, you still questioned me.  But now, when it&#39;s you who I am trying to help, you immediately question my abilities after only the first transformation?&quot;  Esme paused for a moment and shook her head.  &quot;You have insulted my abilities and shown a complete lack of gratitude. I will not waste my time and energy on someone so unappreciative.&quot;<br />
<br />
John&#39;s eyes opened wide and Katie could tell he was about to blow up in Esme&#39;s face.  She quickly stepped in front him.  &quot;John, please, let&#39;s give her some time to cool off,&quot; Katie pleaded with her boyfriend. &quot;I don&#39;t like seeing you like this either, but we need to approach this calmly.&quot;<br />
<br />
John&#39;s shoulders slumped as he realized the gravity of his words. He regretted his outburst, realizing that he had burned a bridge that might have led to a solution. He turned to Katie, his expression filled with remorse. &quot;I messed up, Katie. I let my frustration get the best of me. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie placed a comforting hand on John&#39;s shoulder, her eyes filled with understanding. &quot;It&#39;s okay, John. We all make mistakes, especially in stressful situations like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
John looked past Katie at Esme.  &quot;Please Ms. Esme, just hear us out. We&#39;re desperate for your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Esme sighed.  &quot;I think it&#39;s best that you leave now.&quot;<br />
<br />
John&#39;s heart sank at the thought of spending the rest of his life in this unexpected form. He had hoped to find a quick solution, but it seemed that his impatience had backfired. He couldn&#39;t imagine going through life as Katie&#39;s twin, navigating the world with a body that didn&#39;t feel like his own.<br />
<br />
After a moment of quiet reflection Esme continued.  &quot;However... I believe cooler heads may prevail.  I also believe you need to learn some patience.  Please come back tomorrow at 10am when the mall opens.  If you can be patient and show some appreciation, I will consider assisting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With those words, Esme turned away and started walking among the clothing racks, signaling that the conversation was over.  Katie and John exchanged a glance and John called out to Esme. &quot;Thank you! We&#39;ll be back tomorrow!&quot;  They quietly left the store.<br />
<br />
Standing just outside the store, John kept looking back hoping that Esme would come after them saying she changed her mind and they could try again today.  Katie turned to John.  &quot;So I guess you&#39;re my twin for a day, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
John turned to Katie and shrugged.  &quot;I guess it could be worse.  I could have tentacle arms,&quot; he said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so now I&#39;m one step above a tentacle monster?&quot; Katie asked incredulously.<br />
<br />
John reacted defensively.  &quot;No, that&#39;s not what I meant!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie laughed at his reaction and gave him a playful punch in the shoulder.  &quot;I&#39;m kidding.&quot;  She looked down at John&#39;s clothing on the copy of her body.  &quot;We should probably get you some clothes.  You look ridiculous wearing your old clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
John looked down at himself.  He could see his smaller body practically swimming in his T-shirt and jeans.  His feet would step right out of his shoes if he wasn&#39;t careful.  &quot;Yeah, can I borrow some of your clothes back at your place?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie motioned down the hall of the mall.  &quot;John, we&#39;re at the mall.  We can get you an outfit right here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;ll only need it for a day.  Seems like it might be easier to just borrow something from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may only need it for a day, but I can wear it later.  Win, win!&quot;  Katie grinned with excitement.  &quot;So not only do I get a new outfit and you don&#39;t have to wear your oversized clothes even longer, but I get to see what I&#39;d look like in the outfit without using a mirror!  This is going to be great!&quot;<br />
<br />
John sighed.  &quot;So I&#39;m essentially your dress form today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think of it like that.  Think of it as spending time with your loving girlfriend doing something she really enjoys.&quot;  Katie put her arm around John&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted a sister!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind if I don&#39;t think of you as a sister,&quot; replied John.  &quot;Remember, from my perspective, you&#39;re still my girlfriend.  It&#39;s only when I look down at my body that it&#39;s obvious I&#39;m different.  ...although it is weird seeing eye-to-eye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Convenient for kissing.&quot;  Katie leaned in and kissed John and then snickered.  &quot;Kind of weird to kiss yourself.  I suppose we shouldn&#39;t do that when others are around.  They&#39;ll assume we&#39;re incest twins...and although you&#39;ll hopefully change back tomorrow, I&#39;ve got a reputation to maintain.&quot;  She took John&#39;s hand.  &quot;Okay, enough talking.  Let&#39;s go get you some new clothes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we do shoes first?&quot; requested John.  &quot;It&#39;s hard to walk in these.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded and led John towards a nearby shoe store. On the way, Katie suggested they go over their cover story.  &quot;If you&#39;re okay with it, I&#39;ll call you &#39;Joan&#39; again and tell people you&#39;re my twin sister from out of state.  I assume it&#39;s okay for me to use &#39;she/her&#39; pronouns to refer to you around other people, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s all fine with me,&quot; Joan agreed.  &quot;Anything I should know about being you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie thought for a moment.  &quot;I&#39;m allergic to shellfish...clams, mussels, scallops...  I&#39;m not allergic to crustaceans like crabs, lobster, shrimp, or any fish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan nodded.  &quot;Okay, good to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they entered the shoe store, Joan couldn&#39;t help but feel self-conscious as people glanced at them. He knew his appearance in baggy clothing was unusual, and he couldn&#39;t blame them for staring.<br />
<br />
They browsed through the aisles, searching for a pair of shoes that would fit John&#39;s smaller feet. Katie picked out a few options and placed them on the floor next to Joan.  She took a pair of navy blue flats out of one box and tried them on.  After testing the fit and looking at herself in a mirror, she asked Joan to put them on.<br />
<br />
Joan looked at his reflection in the mirror and moved around in the shoes.  &quot;Oh, there&#39;s a lot less material in these than I&#39;m used to in shoes, but the innersole is nice and spongey.  I like that.  I think these would be comfortable enough to wear around.  Should we get them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they&#39;re on sale too,&quot; revealed Katie with pleasure.  &quot;I also want to try these boots.&quot;  She pulled out a pair of black ankle boots with a two inch heel and a side zipper and slipped them on her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you already have a pair like that?&quot; asked Joan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did, but the zipper broke.&quot;  Katie walked a bit in the boots, jumped, and looked at her reflection.  &quot;I like these.  Now you try them on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie removed the boots and Joan put them on.  He tried walking in them.  &quot;These are much easier to walk in than the heels the other night.  They&#39;re actually quite comfortable.  Not as comfortable as that other pair, but I do like the ankle support.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should wear them,&quot; Katie suggested.  &quot;The heels give you a little height.  You&#39;re taller than me again.  ...or would you prefer I wear them and you can be the short one for a change?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan thought for a moment to consider his options...</p>
