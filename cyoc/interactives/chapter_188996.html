<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>the end of Eric&#39;s dog obsession -- for now? Enjoy hearing from readers, feel free to DM if you&#39;re enjoying the kinks ;)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On Saturday, Eric woke up mid morning. It was still earlyish, with both Ethan and their dad asleep in their rooms. Lazing about on his bed for a while, eventually he got up and wandered through to the kitchen. He grabbed a couple of pop tarts and some chocolate milk and returned to his room, though on the way through, he caught a glimpse of himself in the reflective glass of the hallway cabinet.<br />
<br />
Getting comfy on his bed, Eric ate his breakfast, but his mind was dwelling on that image. The way his boxers bulged out into a rounded bump was mesmerising, and though he was quite used to it by now, nonetheless, to Eric the sight was simply beautiful. Maybe it was weird to think of his crotch that way, but he couldn&#39;t help it! He felt like he had found a missing piece of himself, and his life had changed for the better since Ethan had brought home the ring. Eric was SO happy this penis was his, and after wolfing down the remainder of his food, he wiped his hands and looked down admiringly at his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know we&#39;re sharing, but,&quot; Eric considered it, mulling over his thoughts, &quot;Ethan&#39;s happy being small most of the time. It really suits him, and this? This is PERFECT on me! It just feels right to be larger than most guys. Though, I wish I was even bigger!&quot; He paused, surprised at what he&#39;d admitted to himself, and a blush quickly spread. It was true, he recognised, and with the realisation that he wanted his already oversized junk to be even moreso, another consideration arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just how big am I?&quot; He muttered, and a fresh idea occurred to him. &quot;Maybe ... I should find out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jumping up, he rifled around through his school stuff until he found his stationery items, which included a ruler. Placing it on the nightstand, he stood by his dresser, and began to strip off, a big smile on his face, until he was fully naked in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
Eric wanted to get a really good look at how the swap was treating him.<br />
<br />
He had seen himself unclothed a number of times since he and Ethan had started using the ring, but he had never really spent any time thinking about the relative size of his body, how everything stacked up. Now, he was stopping to soak it in, and he studied his reflection carefully, like a scientist embarking on the most important mission in the history of mankind.<br />
<br />
Eric was shorter than average, and in good shape for his age, but still slim and kinda scrawny. His arms and legs were slender, his tummy flat, his butt round, shoulders narrow, and hair a medium-length messy dark brown. He never used to feel happy with his appearance -- he&#39;d wasn&#39;t big or strong or gifted with that blossoming young masculinity that most other boys his age seemed to be getting. Now though? Now he loved his body in spite of his insecurities, and he didn&#39;t WANT to be like them. It was the opposite -- he wanted to be who he was, the exact way he was -- and it was all thanks to one thing!<br />
<br />
At the centre of his crotch, there it lay, the source of all the good fortune in his life, the reason he had learned to accept himself. Pushing out of his groin, it curved majestically in front of his thighs, and Eric delicately wrapped his fingers around the base with a reverence that was nearly religious. His smaller body proportions made it seem even more gigantic than it already was, and the thickness was almost -- very literally -- that of a salami. Where the root connected to him, it took up almost all the space at the narrow V junction of his legs, and Eric noted with delighted shock that even soft it reached about two thirds of the way to his knees.<br />
<br />
It was huge, it was magnificent, it was gorgeous -- and it was his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; he whispered, fully engrossed in pure penis-obsessed joy, and then he waggled his hips, the shaft swinging lazily back and forth like an erotic fleshy pendulum. He giggled, licking his lips, and reveled in the weight of it lightly tugging as it moved. &quot;It&#39;s just ... the BEST! I GOTTA measure it now, I really have to see what size it is hard!&quot;<br />
<br />
Squeezing, Eric stroked and watched his prized possession swell and grow until it was firm enough to be used for a comparison. Picking up the ruler, he placed it flush with the skin of his belly, and pressed the stiffness as close as he could to the plastic. With immense pride, he saw that the ruler, which clocked in at a foot in length, barely surpassed the end of his penis, by little more than a single inch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eleven inches. My cock is nearly eleven inches!&quot; Turning to the side, he checked himself out from that angle, and choked out a soft laugh of amazement. Hard, his dick would have reached his knees if it wasn&#39;t erect and forced to point outward, but equally ridiculous, it was as long as he was wide, the length matching the width of his body from hip to hip. In profile, his penis appeared even more obscene, the thick shaft extending forward several inches further than the total back-to-front distance from his butt to tummy.<br />
<br />
He knew he was blessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So good. So big. I want to suck on it again, there&#39;s nothing better than that!&quot; His thoughts were totally cock-centred, and Eric was in a wonderland, staring with a dreamy smile. Then without much thought, his other hand slid under to cradle his testicles, and his attention shifted.<br />
<br />
Balls!<br />
<br />
His were just as impressive as his dick, and deserved the same level of adoration. He loved that they were teenaged and could produce cum, and he loved even more that his brother had kept them so smooth and clean. Most of all, he loved that he couldn&#39;t fit both in the palm of his hand at once, nor was there space between his legs for them to rest. Instead, they say heavily in front, lying against his thighs like oversized plums, and their amazing soft skin rubbed enticingly whenever he moved. They were sensitive, and heated, and had an erotic sway to them, a weight that made him want to play with them, and hinted at just how much they contained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember that it was a LOT.&quot; Eric smirked to himself, gently massaging them with his left hand, while his right slowly stroked his still-hard cock. He stared at his reflection, the plump orbs shifting under his kneading fingers, and thought back to the fair. After he had bested the bully, he had jerked off onto the stall&#39;s rear wall, and the mess he made then was spectacular -- and AWESOME -- and before Eric knew it, he was creating a fantasy that he was there again!<br />
<br />
Except, this time ... he was bigger.<br />
<br />
Eric began to jack off, closing his eyes while he visited his imagination. The fantasy had his cock grow to an absurd foot-and-a-half, and his nuts bloat to thrice their size, like overstuffed oranges. His expanded package was drool-worthy, and it semed to only take moments for the fantasy version of himself to become overwhelmed from the size and sensations, reaching the point of no return. Fantasy Eric started blasting, and the hose at his crotch was launching continuous volleys of white that sprayed forth, all over the wood panels and ground. Except now it was far more, like a couple of buckets of paint had been launched at the wall, and tossed across the intervening yards of dirt, but before Eric&#39;s real-life masturbation could catch up with his fantasy self, the images in his head shifted on their own.<br />
<br />
Now, his fantasy was backstage at the fair, alone, and Mr Thompson&#39;s spaniel was in front of him. Scout&#39;s tail was wagging, the snuffling nose happily buried in the underside of Eric&#39;s enormous sac, and the tongue -- it was diligently licking across the surface. Swipe after swipe after swipe of that wonderful wetness, and Eric&#39;s hand sped up, his breath coming faster as he saw his fantasy self given a doggy crotch bath. Something about the idea was extra stimulating, more interesting than previously -- a combination of his super-endowed self and the canine crotch-worship -- and it took maybe two dozen seconds before it was too much.<br />
<br />
Eric began to cum.<br />
<br />
He turned, his hips beginning to instinctively pump, and opened his eyes. Muscles in his arches and calves tensed, toes curling, bolts of pleasure shooting up his legs, while his chest and arms tightened. His balls contracted, and his cock began to blissfully imitate his daydream, the thick fluid rushing through it in a joyous expulsion. Each volley hit the mirror with a splat, and he grunted as he thrust his cock, his face pink, his stomach clenching in time to the staccato of liquid impacts, until after more than ten ejaculations, it slowed and stopped.<br />
<br />
Wow.<br />
<br />
He was breathing heavily, lightheaded, and his body was abuzz. The mirror was liberally coated in so much sperm that he could hardly see his reflection, with streaky trails of it rolling downward.. His testicles felt drained, for the moment, his softening cock spent and a little tender, globs of jizz dripping and oozing from the foreskin onto the carpet. He&#39;d made another great big mess, in exactly the way he wanted, but one thing was extremely clear in the afterglow, perhaps moreso than ever before.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was intense! I have to do another dog swap!&quot; Eric told himself. He knew what had really turned him on, and caused him to erupt, and he couldn&#39;t wait to do it again. He wanted more! &quot;Like, I really REALLY have to. I gotta figure out how to make it happen again. I&#39;ll find a way, and when I do?&quot; He giggled, and took a deep breath, admiring the fantastic wreckage of his cum-covered dresser. &quot;I&#39;ll see if I can top this!&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t too much later that Eric heard his brother up and moving around. He was talking to somebody on the phone, and he didn&#39;t think much of it until he ran into Ethan in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be going out soon. I just had a call from an old work friend of Mr Reyes, and he asked me if I could help him out at short notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Eric was only half paying attention, because it wasn&#39;t uncommon for Ethan to sometimes do odd jobs for neighbours to earn a little extra pocket money in between schoolwork. &quot;What time will you be back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll just be for a couple of hours. Gotta walk his mastiffs at the Hillside Club, some fancy members-only park for dogs. Mr Reyes recommended us, guess he thought you did a good job with Prince.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait a second! Dogs?!<br />
<br />
This was fate!<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,&quot; he asked, completely innocent, &quot;can I come too? Kinda bored with hanging out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Ethan was surprised. &quot;You want to spend time at the park with your big brother? I&#39;d have thought you&#39;d rather stay home and amuse yourself with our favourite toy, &quot; he teased, with a nod to the younger brother&#39;s ample crotch-bump.<br />
<br />
&quot;It IS fun,&quot; Eric giggled, &quot;but I can&#39;t sit here all the time and play with my dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough,&quot; his brother laughed. &quot;Grab what you need, we&#39;ll be leaving shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
A couple of minutes after that, they were driving across town. The owner, Mr Lynn, gave Ethan brief directions to the park, expressed confidence in Mr Reyes&#39; recommendation being accurate, and told them to make sure the dogs burned their energy off. Then they were being politely but firmly ushered out, as he had to get going.<br />
<br />
The dogs were a pair of Pyrenean Mastiffs, one white with a grey mask and splotches -- Buster -- and the other the same but black colouring instead -- Atlas. They were big sturdy fluffy dogs, with thick coats, jowls, and lolling tongues, and they tugged on their leads all the way to the park, glad to be outside and eager to be going somewhere. In no time, the brothers were at their destination, and were let inside.<br />
<br />
It was an exclusive venue, this being the richer part of town, and the park was extensive. Enclosed and private from the public, it had several paths and hedges dividing it into a number of little sections, and lot of grassy space to play in. Despite that it was a Saturday, it was fairly quiet, with only a few other people walking their pets, and Eric noted this with satisfaction.<br />
<br />
He just needed the right opportunity to make something happen!<br />
<br />
At the park&#39;s main junction was a courtyard with a paved area that the other sections split off from. It had a couple of benches to sit on, and a small fountain that was the centrepiece. They paused to admire it, the intricate carved stone and tiers, and it also depicted several little winged cherubs as decoration. Eric stifled a giggle, the first thing entering his head that the naked statues reminded him of someone.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have really tiny dicks, just like Ethan! Wonder if he&#39;ll notice?&quot; He bit his lip, and glanced at his brother. Ethan was staring at the closest cherub, his eyes clearly fixed on its nethers, his face red, a subtle look of embarrassment there. Again, Eric wanted to laugh, but he also felt kinda bad about it, even with the concept of them sharing still present but now distant at the back of his mind. &quot;He definitely did! I hope he&#39;s not unhappy because he&#39;s small. I should probably keep us moving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Distracting Ethan, Eric urged them onwards, and they continued along one of the paths. He noticed that his brother seemed to forget about what they&#39;d just seen, and his shameful reaction began to fade. Before long they were wandering the grounds, enjoying the warmth of the day and the sunshine, and it took a least fifteen minutes before Eric got the break he was looking for.<br />
<br />
There was a sound, and Ethan pulled his phone out of his pocket. It was ringing, and he looked at the display to see a name he wasn&#39;t expecting. His eyes lit up, but he paused, uncertain.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Lucas! I want to talk to him but-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Answer it! I can do this.&quot; Eric told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? I don&#39;t want to leave it all to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s cool, bro.&quot; He took Buster&#39;s lead out of Ethan&#39;s hands, and gestured back towards the park centre, where the benches were. &quot;Go find a seat and talk to him. I&#39;ll take care of these two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Eric. I&#39;ll text you when I&#39;m done.&quot; Ethan smiled in gratitude, and walked off, answering the call as he did.<br />
<br />
Waiting &#39;til he was out of direct visual range, Eric immediately looked at the two dogs, who were waiting, watching him, tails wagging expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, guys,&quot; he said, softly, &quot;let&#39;s go find a quiet place, and then we can ... play.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It began as a simple phone call just to chat, but Ethan&#39;s nerves were running high, because of the person on the other end. Still, as he sat down on the bench next to the fountain, he found himself beginning to relax. Lucas was really good at putting him at ease, and their conversation turned from the boring details of what they were up to -- Lucas was at home, in his room, chilling with his own little brother, apparently -- to talking more about the previous night.<br />
<br />
It was a totally new experience for Ethan to admit out loud that he was attracted to another guy. Alluding to it with Haylee was one thing, but saying it directly to the subject of his interest was a lot more intimidating. Lucas did make everything simpler though, and the more they talked, the calmer he felt ... but then he couldn&#39;t help his eyes being pulled to the fountain.<br />
<br />
Specifically, to the cherubs.<br />
<br />
From nowhere, the voice of his conscience spoke in a mocking whisper from the depths of his brain: &#39;you look just like them, and you&#39;re seventeen!&#39;<br />
<br />
He was somehow managing to keep listening to what Lucas was saying, but at the same time he was unavoidably drawn to the fountain&#39;s statues, and he couldn&#39;t stop staring. &quot;My cock IS around that size,&quot; he thought, and his face began to redden. He felt desperately inadequate; unworthy because he was so much lesser, but it stung even more because he knew it was true. The cherubs looked proportional, appropriate, because they were meant to be childlike, but him? Ethan was older. He was supposed to at the minimum have a regular size penis, at least five inches. Yet, the carved stone genitals matched his own, and he could feel it, the material caressing the childishly smooth skin, as it lay hidden in his underwear -- a tiny youthful cock less than half that average length, barely finger thickness, with two of the smallest tightest balls imaginable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I this way? Why do I LIKE it?&quot; Ethan wasn&#39;t sure why, but he was very confused, and he felt like he couldn&#39;t concentrate, his mind fuzzy. He wondered to himself how he hadn&#39;t matured like other guys his age, and that he had to deserve it. It was ... right? -- but it was also ... strange, somehow? &quot;Why am I still like a kid? Would- ... would he even be into me like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait.<br />
<br />
What was going on?<br />
<br />
With shock, Ethan realised what he was doing, and it freaked him out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. No! This isn&#39;t REALLY mine! This is Eric&#39;s cock! We- ... we&#39;re sharing! I&#39;m bigger. Much bigger.&quot; Frightened that he had almost subconsciously slipped into believing his bizarre perverted fantasy was reality, Ethan was on the verge of a break down. His self-reassurance was necessary, but it was also more forced and frantic than he wanted it to be. &quot;Lucas knows that&#39;s who I am. He knows my real size! He knows I&#39;m not a freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not Babycock Ethan.&quot; He repeated it in his head. &quot;I&#39;m not! I&#39;m big Ethan. Hung Ethan. Stud Ethan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet, somehow, despite his self-reinforcement, even knowing the truth that his little brother was walking around with an impressive borrowed teenage cock, Ethan was struggling to believing one hundred percent that the dick attached to him was NOT his.<br />
<br />
He just couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that he owned it ... and that SCARED him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello? Ethan?&quot; Lucas was calling his name. &quot;Still there? You went silent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, s-sorry.&quot; Ethan shook his head and looked away from the fountain, swallowing nervously, and instead focusing on the hedge rows. &quot;I, um, zoned out there a bit. I didn&#39;t mean to ignore you, I&#39;m really sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s cool. I was talking for a while, I guess.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;Hey, um, I hope this isn&#39;t too forward, but would you like to get together some time this week, on whatever day you&#39;d like? Preferably after school hours, or even on the weekend if that suits?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, do you mean like, uh ... a-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Date?&quot; Lucas interrupted. &quot;Yes. That&#39;s exactly what I mean. I&#39;m asking you out.&quot; The smile in his tone was obvious, and it made Ethan&#39;s heart flutter in a good way, managing to drown out the freaky attitude and put him in a better headspace. Lucas went on though, and the compliments kept coming. &quot;I think you&#39;re fun, and smart, and kind, and ... unique. There&#39;s SO much more I want to know about your life. Not to mention ... cute. Super super cute. So, uh,&quot; he finished, &quot;what do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Super cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d ... really like that.&quot; Ethan replied, and down below, his boyish penis stiffened into a mini-erection, straining as hard as it could in response to the praise.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take Eric long to find a section of the park that was ideal for what he wanted. Due to how segmented everything was, he chose an area off the side of a path dotted with small trees and shrubs, giving a number of good temporary hiding spots. Like the bleachers at the soccer game, he also had an excellent line of sight on the couple of adjoining entrance points, so he would easily be able to spot any people either walking past or into his zone. Not that interference was going to be much of an issue, as he had seen only a few other people around at all.<br />
<br />
It was perfect.<br />
<br />
Eric went straight for the classic swap first -- the tail -- and removed his pants and boxers in preparation. Buster was the one he was borrowing from, and the Pyrenean seemed momentarily confused when his big fluffy queue -- maybe even moreso fluffier than the previous tails Eric had experienced -- vanished and then reappeared on the boy next to him.<br />
<br />
For the next five minutes, Eric ran around the grass in only his shirt, the mastiffs chasing and running with him, his furry addition flying in the breeze and his junk bobbing and slapping his thighs. It was oddly liberating and just fun to be naked, and he felt freer than ever before. The warm day and wind on his underparts was fantastic, and he could have spent half an hour just horsing about with the dogs, but another opportunity came along.<br />
<br />
He caught a glimpse of someone walking past through one of the taller hedges. Atlas had plopped down on the grass, panting heavily, ready for a break, while Buster was still hanging around his feet, good for more. With a flash of inspiration, he knew what he wanted to do! One of the best parts of his adventure from the fair was having Mr Thompson surprise him and stay around without knowing what was going on. The thrill of it had made everything SO much better, and now ... Eric wanted to try that again. Bolder, more confident and in control than ever before, he was at the peak of his experimentation, and with a gentle tug on Buster&#39;s collar, he strode fearlessly off to the planned intercept spot, the mastiff trailing obediently at his side.<br />
<br />
Reaching a section of hedge that dipped lower next to the path, he caught the eye of the passerby, called out a friendly &#39;hello! and gave a little wave. The foliage came most of the way up his chest, and he stood at an angle, his left arm and hand resting on the top. On the other side, the path was set lower down, so Eric could see over it easier than vice versa, the hedge acting as a visual shield. The other person was a boy, a couple of inches taller, maybe a year older, in preppy shorts and a polo shirt, walking a little floofy white-haired dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi!&quot; The other boy stopped next to where Eric was, and returned the greeting. He seemed friendly enough.<br />
<br />
Yep, Eric decided, this was gonna work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool dog!&quot; Eric grinned, and nodded at it. &quot;It looks like the one from Secret Life of Pets. What breed is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
He laughed, not seeming to mind the random conversation. &quot;Yeah, she&#39;s the same type as Gidget -- a Pomeranian. What&#39;s yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got two. They&#39;re, uh, Pyreneans? I think that&#39;s the name.&quot; Eric pulled Buster in closer with his unseen free right hand, positioning him right in front. The mastiff sat, being generally well behaved, and Eric knew from prior experience that he wouldn&#39;t have to wait long. &quot;Walking them for a friend. They&#39;re big and they have a lot of energy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know those. Are they like the English Mastiff?&quot; The other boy began to speak, his curiosity piqued, and he first introduced himself as Mikey, and then led into more questions. Before long they were comfortably chatting over the hedge like old neighbours, and Eric reveled in the feeling of the open air wafting around his bare butt and across his thighs. He began to harden as they made small talk, and it was with no small amount of glee that he enjoyed the sexual anticipation of his dick slowly filling with blood as it extended out. The movement must have been enough, because then ... THEN ... he felt it.<br />
<br />
Buster&#39;s nose.<br />
<br />
It brushed against him, sniffing for a moment, and right after that ... the tongue.<br />
<br />
Oh ... YEAH. This was what he was waiting for!<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s focus was on masterfully controlling his reactions, and he put his ability to concentrate to the test while he made small talk with Mikey. Buster&#39;s tongue was slathering his nuts, savouring the salt of human skin, and it felt just as amazing as when Scout had done it for those few seconds -- except this was bigger, better, wetter, and it kept going on, and on, and on! This was exactly what Eric had wanted to happen -- he had thought about that horny moment from the fair multiple times -- and his cock reached full size, stiff and hot, clear liquid dripping from the tip. He scratched behind the dog&#39;s ear with his guiding right hand, a deliberate encouragement, and the tactic worked like a charm. The licking turned more diligent, the master&#39;s approval increasing Buster&#39;s enthusiasm, and he became more animated, eagerly coating the entire sac in earnest joyous attention.<br />
<br />
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick ...<br />
<br />
Eric was on top of the world, involved in an exciting weird balancing act of his choosing. On one side, his casual conversational poker face was foolproof, his voice steady, his train of thought maintained so that he wasn&#39;t talking gibberish, the innocent act pitch perfect. On the other, his boyish bottom-half was naked, his penis enormous and iron hard, his heavy swollen balls receiving the most glorious tongue bath, and his 17-year old libido on fire with cocky swagger.<br />
<br />
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick ...<br />
<br />
Buster slowed for a second, perhaps about to stop, and Eric spread his legs wider in pure masculine satisfaction, covertly nudging the dog back in place, and the momentary loss of interest happily picked right back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s it,&quot; he thought, even as he gave a straight-faced comment to Mikey&#39;s question about his favourite breeds and then the query about which school he went to, all while the tongue slid around the side of his fat left testicle, then back across the centre, rubbing over the base of his shaft. &quot;Don&#39;t stop. Good boy. Just ... keep washing my balls. Yeah, like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The best moments were when he and Mikey made eye contact while they talked, at the same as his sac was joggling from Buster&#39;s lapping tongue, the incredible smoothness and slipping sensation like some kind of heaven. Those moment were even MORE awesome when he felt his tail wag past, the feathery tickling of it rhythmically brushing his butt and thighs just adding to the pleasure.<br />
<br />
Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick, lick ...<br />
<br />
Finally, Mikey mentioned that he probably had to go as he had told his mom he wouldn&#39;t take too long, and somehow managing to keep his voice even, Eric agreed, stating that it had been cool to meet him. With a goodbye, the two gave each other a friendly wave and then Mikey was off. He wasn&#39;t even fully out of sight down the path and Eric was grinning smugly at his successful deception, and then he dropped his left to join the right, stroking behind Buster&#39;s ears with both hands.<br />
<br />
He looked down, and his cock was red and twitchy, the clenching muscles making it jerk in time to the lapping, the head dripping like crazy. Pushing his hips forward into Buster&#39;s muzzle, he grunted out loud, feeling every inch the teenage stud that he mostly physically wasn&#39;t, the self-control and adult level of stamina making him &#39;the man&#39; in his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy! Good dog!&quot; He murmured, and then began to groan. &quot;Unnh- ... uhhh- ... hnnnnnnh!&quot;<br />
<br />
Without touching himself, he came. He felt the exquisite sensation of liquid shooting up his massive shaft, then the treat of it flying out his engorged glans. Thick and sticky, he grunted as each jet was expelled, his balls pumping as the tongue continued throughout. His brain was in an orgasmic fog, but he counted them, smiling dopily through half-lidded eyes at the cum splashing onto the hedge branches. It petered out at eleven, his age, and smirking at the number, he drew in a big breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was ... INCREDIBLE.&quot; He carefully pushed the dog away, the insistent licking now an over-stimulation, and crouched down, his legs feeling wobbily. He&#39;d never done it like THAT before! &quot;You did amazing, Buster! Good boy!&quot; He praised the Pyrenean, and hugged the big dog around the shoulders. &quot;Let me catch my breath, and then we&#39;ll go play some more before Ethan finds us. Just you, me, and Atlas. You&#39;ve earned it!&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
With the sexy part of his adventure out of the way, Eric did the other parts of the swap he had missed at the fair, but still wanted to do. First, the tongue -- it was just as wide and flat and messier than Prince&#39;s tongue, and it was almost constantly hanging out of his mouth. The other was the front paws, and, again, they were a little larger and clumpier than the Alsatian&#39;s, but nonetheless he loved it. Buster seemed confused at first, and having human hands on him looked VERY odd, but his doggy instincts didn&#39;t treat them much differently than usual. They were just different-shaped hairless paws to him, and after a little bit he didn&#39;t seem to care.<br />
<br />
They roused Atlas from his resting spot, and true to his word, Eric spent the next few minutes frolicking and playing on the grass with both. His phone was in earshot, and he didn&#39;t forget to keep an eye out for people, but for the most part it was carefree. The Pyreneans were friendly and tactile, and when they weren&#39;t chasing and galloping around, they tumbled together in a mess of slobbery happiness and boyish giggles.<br />
<br />
Eric felt so comfortable, so natural this way, that he was almost sad he had to hide it. The ground beneath his paws, the breeze on his oversized tongue, the companionship of the dogs next to him, and then simple affection and attention -- it was all just wonderful. He wanted to prolong it, and drag out that time even further, but after roughly a combined duration of nearly a half hour, he heard his phone buzz where his pants were. Trotting back over to it, he awkwardly grasped the device so he could see the screen, and confirm that it was Ethan.<br />
<br />
It was.<br />
<br />
Slipping the ring over a claw, Buster&#39;s lead wrapped around his arm, he focused on reversing the swap, and ... nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Hmm?<br />
<br />
Eric tried again, repeating the thought.<br />
<br />
Still, nothing.<br />
<br />
A third time, he tried, and yet, still ... nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Then, there was a jolt from the ring, like a small electric shock, and he was groggy, and then a voice spoke into his head, sounding like an answering machine playing a pre-recorded message.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can only swap if you are truly comfortable doing so. The feelings of the other person do not matter, but if in your own heart you are unwilling to do it -- even if you consciously wish to -- the swap will still fail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh ... no.<br />
<br />
He ... wanted this? He wanted to be a dog-boy?<br />
<br />
What was he going to do?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric!&quot; He heard Ethan&#39;s voice calling him, muffled slightly but nearby, and for the first time in a long while, his confidence failed him. Paralysed with indecision and fear, he couldn&#39;t think what to do, how to solve this, and before he could overcome it, he heard his brother&#39;s voice again, this time direct and clear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric?&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked up to see Ethan walking slowly towards him over the grass, a shocked expression on his face, and Eric couldn&#39;t help it, his eyes beginning to well up with tears at the embarrassment of his mistake.<br />
<br />
&quot;What on earth are you doing?&quot; His big brother crouched down next to him and his unworn clothing. &quot;I didn&#39;t even know it was possible to swap with animals. Did you get stuck like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric tried to speak, but he couldn&#39;t manage more than a basic sound, his long thick canine tongue making speech all but impossible, so instead he nodded guiltily. He couldn&#39;t use his hands to express any body language either, because they weren&#39;t hands.<br />
<br />
Just paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, little bro.&quot; Ethan sighed, frowning, and the reaction hurt more than being shouted at, because it was a clear sign of disappointment, and Eric HATED disappointing his big brother. &quot;I know we&#39;ve been having fun with it, but I thought you were more responsible. You get why we can&#39;t be this reckless, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded again, downcast and remorseful.<br />
<br />
&quot;This has gotten out of hand.&quot; Ethan&#39;s tone was stern. &quot;It&#39;s probably a good idea if we go back to being fully ourselves, for the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
What?! No! Anything but that! Eric looked up, pleading with his teary eyes, but Ethan shot him a warning glance, and he knew that this wasn&#39;t the time and place to argue. He was in trouble, and he deserved the lecture.<br />
<br />
&quot;No buts, Eric. I love you, but right now, you&#39;ve gotta do what I say, understand? I&#39;m not angry, but I did expect more from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan took the ring off his paw, then Buster&#39;s lead. Then he picked up Eric&#39;s pants, and slid them over his ankles and up his legs far enough, even though they really didn&#39;t fit, so he was still &#39;wearing&#39; them. A few seconds of Ethan concentrating later, and the parts were transferred from Buster back to Eric. Ashamed, he pulled on his pants, socks and shoes, staying wordless even after he had his human tongue back, until Ethan handed the ring to him once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what to do,&quot; his brother said.<br />
<br />
With despair and sadness, Eric focused, and felt the amazing gift of his- ... no, Ethan&#39;s dick, thinning and shortening, his testicles shrinking, his sac drawing up tight to his groin. These were his genitals again, though even as he handed the ring back, suitably chastised for his carelessness, he couldn&#39;t shake that it didn&#39;t feel right, and Eric mournfully admitted that they didn&#39;t feel like his anymore ... at all.</p>
