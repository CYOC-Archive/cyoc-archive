<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will took his time checking the bottles out, they each had their own unique look, and the liquid within them were different colors. He pointed to one of the vials, it had an octagonal stopper on it. &quot;How is this one supposed to help me.&quot; His skepticism surrounding his every word.<br />
<br />
The old man's eyes lite up. &quot;This one is very helpful for you, it is for the young ladies in your life. I will sell it to you for ten dollars, I have plenty of these.&quot; He said, his smile crossing his face once more. <br />
<br />
Will nodded, he couldn't put his finger on it, but the old man was just strange. Taking out his wallet, Will handed him a ten dollar bill. The old man bowed slightly, as Will walked out of the store. He took the stopper out as he was walking, trying to figure out what it was that he had bought, taking a whiff of it. &quot;Must be perfume, smells nice.&quot; As Will was walking he bumped into a jogger as she passed him, splashing the contents all over his face. &quot;Sorry, my fault.&quot; He said wiping the stuff from his face. &quot;Great, now I'm going to smell like a flower all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will continued to walk along the sidewalk, getting ever hotter by the minute. He felt like the temperature had risen ten degrees in the last five minutes. He was seemingly the only one that noticed this, taking off his jacket he slinged it around his arm. Will kept having to flick something away from his ear, it became increasingly annoying. &quot;Damn bugs.&quot; He said, his voice an octave higher, putting it off to the fact that he was thirsty.<br />
<br />
While Will was walking, he hadn't noticed the natural way it felt to sway his hips back and forth as he walked. Will raised the sleeve that had engulfed his hand, checking his watch for the time. ~Better hurry up, or I'm gonna miss the bus. Man, I need to start working out again, my arms are getting thin.~ He thought to himself has he quickened his pace. Making it to the bus stop, just as the bus had arrived. The driver opened the door, he walked in. &quot;How much?&quot; He shook his head, clearing his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;$3.50 Miss.&quot; The driver said, not really looking at Will in the first place.<br />
<br />
Will mocked laughed at the driver's pathetic joke at his voice cracking. Placing the money into the machine, he walked to the first open seat he saw. Will smiled, the air conditioning felt great compared to the heat from outside. Taking a passive gaze around the bus, he saw several men, most of them much older, taking a hard look at him. He shook his head, paying it no mind, probably checking out his jacket. <br />
<br />
Throughout the bus ride Will couldn't help but notice that the busses must have been fitted with new cushions, a nice added feature. Getting to his feet, Will prepared to get off at the next stop, only a block away from his house, his shirt felt baggy as did most of his other clothes. ~Great, time to go shopping with Megan again.~ <br />
<br />
Getting off the bus, and walking toward his apartment, he couldn't help but feel like he was being watched, shrugging it off as being overly cautious. It only took a few minutes and then he was there, reaching into his pocket for his keys, he grabbed them, making his way into the building and into his apartment. Closing the door behind him, Will through his jacket onto the couch, he wanted to take a shower, he felt grimy from perspiring so much.<br />
<br />
Walking into the bathroom, Will took off his shirt, noticing an unnatural bounce as he did so, he looked down to check what it was, sufficed to say, Will's jaw dropped. Where once was a manly chest, now stood to mountain sized mounds of flesh. His heart began to race, this was definitely not something you'd want. He wasn't sure if he wanted to know the extent of the damage done, but gaining up the nerve, he pulled down his pants, keeping his over sized boxers on. He (or she rather) checked the unfamiliar and unwanted body out in the mirror. She was a knockout, her face was beautiful, soft to the touch, a slightly upturned nose, pouty lips, and hair that framed her face perfectly.<br />
<br />
Will's eyes gazed slowly down the mirror, to gage what had changed. Instead of a thick neck and broad shoulders, it was the exact opposite, delicate and very feminine. Moving down further, there were of course the breasts, a nice size not too big, not too small. Even further their laid a nicely toned stomach. She stepped sideways to get a look at anything else, she obviously noted the larger hips, which when she turned she could see a nice ass, perfect. Her legs were like silk as she ran her fingers along them, leading down to dainty feet, she also noticed that her hands and arms had become very thin and delicate, just like they should be...for a woman, but she was a man. &quot;This would be good to see, not to be.&quot; She said in a new higher and more feminine voice. There was also a change in height that he noticed, things in the room seemed bigger, she must have been around 5'7&quot;.<br />
<br />
Will sat on the edge of the bath, thinking about what she should do, she new that she was definitely female where it counted and didn't feel like getting more depressed by seeing it. She'd have to get back to the store to get back to normal, but she couldn't very well go out like this, maybe Megan had left some of her clothes at his place. She was still debating whether or not to call and let Megan know what happened, for either fear of not being believed or being ridiculed and laughed at for it. What to do...</p>
