<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zack slowly made his way in the general direction of the female's den. He was in a slightly sour mood because his ideas were rejected out of hand, but he wasn't about to challenge Jensen on the issue. Jensen was, after all, BIGGER then he was, and with Kaylee and the rest of the pack blindly loyal to him, challenging the alpha male was a ticket to getting himself killed. Not that Zack really wanted to challenge Jensen's position. The position he wanted was to be his second, like his female form had been to Jennifer... but then, being second-in-command would likely now require having sex with Jensen, which Zack definitely didn't want to do.<br />
<br />
Zack only sighed. There were many females in the pack, and not all of them would be able to have sex with Jensen, and Zack was there to relieve them of their &quot;stresses&quot;. And for the time being, Zack could think of no other way of unwinding but to give them all a good time. It would certainly make him feel better.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the female's den, a very non-sexual atmosphere prevailed.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said THAT!?&quot; Nicole growled to Nick.<br />
<br />
Nick nodded, having explained the conversation in the male's den and what Zack had said about Roger, Lawrence, and Ulysses. Nicole had only asked him what Zack and he had been thinking when they approached female's den earlier. Nick confessed everything... partially because he new not to make Nicole angry in anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;That male gets NONE of us, understand?!&quot; Nicole growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;But cousin, he is GOOD,&quot; Alexandra pleaded, &quot;He made Pearl and I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;UNDERSTAND!?&quot; Nicole growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, cousin,&quot; Alexandra nodded weakly.<br />
<br />
Nicole then turned back to Nick, who still looked slightly puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I do something wrong?&quot; Nick asked nervously.<br />
<br />
Nicole caressed Nicks chin with her paws, &quot;No, Nick. Roger, Lawrence, and Ulysses are your friends. Pack mates. You never treat them poorly, and you do not give half-hearted apologies to the Alpha Female or the Master. You did the right thing... Zack is apparently just as manipulative and scheming as the girl that was once friends with the master when he was a she.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You knew him before?&quot; Pearl asked, feeling embarrassed that she had had sex with Zack now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last night was not the first night they came here,&quot; Nicole answered, &quot;all that I heard was what I could overhear. Nothing more. But what I heard did not make me think much of Zack's former self... which apparently hasn't left him in his new gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we do?&quot; Nick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zack will learn the price he will pay for being so rude and disloyal to the Master,&quot; Nicole assured him, &quot;leave THAT to me. You, my beloved pervert, will need to put the rest of the pack's males through a good body building program. They have the testosterone. They can build muscle in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don't know anything about a body building program,&quot; Nick spoke, &quot;Most of what I got now is a result of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I suggest you do some research,&quot; Nicole instructed, &quot;they have websites that run all the instructional guides needed, and I'm sure the shadows can order the weights needed for them to train... and if catch you looking at...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't, I won't, I promise,&quot; Nick answered and hurried on his way.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Bart, Jenny, Marcy, and Kevin were all watching television quietly when they heard large footsteps approaching the room they were in. At first they assumed it was Jensen coming with some instructions, but to their surprise it was Alice riding on the back of the largest wolf they had ever seen that wasn't a werewolf like the others. He was covered in black fur with golden highlights.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone, meet Mr. P!&quot; Alice smiled happily as they attracted the attention of the other four pups and Martha, who quietly stood guard after all the hub-bub of Patrick's arrival began to settle down.<br />
<br />
Mr. P slowly padded up to the first pup, Marcy and sniffed, taking in her scent. He then opened his mouth and began to lick the pups face, making her squeal happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpa!&quot; Jenny cheered and leaped at Mr. P to catch his head and neck in a flying hug. Mr. P barely felt the impact of the nine year old wolf. He only turned and gave her a lick or two as well. Jenny and Marcy both licked his cheeks in response to this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Jenny,&quot; Mr. P spoke calmly, &quot;I trust you're safe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am,&quot; Jenny smiled, still hugging him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am to understand you have siblings now?&quot; Mr. P inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jenny nodded and turned to Bart, &quot;this is Bart. We're nine. And these are our younger brother and sister, Kevin and Marcy. They're seven. And Alice is seven and a half. She is our half sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Half?&quot; Mr. P wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee is our mother,&quot; Bart explained, &quot;Darla is Alice's mother. Jensen is our father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. P nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is Miss Martha,&quot; Jenny then finished her introductions, &quot;Our nanny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. P nodded to Martha, and Martha simply nodded back silently.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you watching?&quot; Mr. P asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;White Fang,&quot; Kevin answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A fitting program,&quot; Mr. P answered as he laid down with Alice still riding his back and Jenny still hugging his neck. He would enjoy guarding his family and was more then ready to do so. There were some things that Mr. P felt he needed to tell Jensen about, particularly the the attitude of the one called &quot;Zack&quot;, but for now, he was content to watch a half wolf half dog save an Alaskan gold miner from a bear.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hello,&quot; Zack spoke with a semi-confident grin as he found Nicole baring the entrance to the female's den.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Nicole said icily, ignoring the pheromone laced scent that Zack gave off.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're other wolf not treat you right?&quot; Zack commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Nicole answered, &quot;My wolf may be perverted, but he's at least a good wolf. Unlike others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then before Zack could say anything, Nicole kicked him him where it hurt the most. Zack gave a pained, and high pitched &quot;yip&quot; and dropped to the ground clutching his groin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our den is off limits to you until you learn to treat your pack mates with respect and submit to the will of the alphas!&quot; Nicole growled as she stood over him, with several other females standing behind her, one pastel green one looking exceptionally mad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no desire to challenge Jensen,&quot; Zack whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You only desire his mate,&quot; Nicole growled back, &quot;I watched you during the entire interaction with the master's great-grandfather. You were lecherously eying the Alpha Female and the Betas. You should know full well that they are ONLY for the master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you be certain I wasn't eying Isabelle, Grace, or Hope?&quot; Zack asked back, &quot;other then their fur color, hair style, and some facial features, they might as well be copies of the Alpha Female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They still hold our rank though,&quot; Nicole answered, &quot;subordinate. Getting into them would only gain you sexual pleasure, nothing more. Getting into the Alpha Female or the Betas would bring the Master's sexual strength into question and could destroy the pack. You were eying what you can not have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack was now beginning to see why Jennifer feared this woman when they had had all been human. He tried to think of an argument that could earn him some points, probably with the other she-wolves present.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was beaten in one on one combat by an old man,&quot; Zack commented, &quot;it took all of you to subdue him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Master can take care of himself,&quot; Ashley growled from behind Nicole, &quot;If he wanted to he could have easily killed his great-grandfather without our help. But the Master didn't want that... and we helped him because he is our Master. Our Alpha. We are LOYAL to him. Not to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I took you to the ground with one good kick between your legs,&quot; Nicole smiled triumphantly, &quot;Now, when you learn your lesson and submit to the will of the Master and Alpha Female, I will consider allowing you in here to mate with my fellow she-wolves, if they let you... until then, we are off-limits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack only grumbled and crawled away. As he did so, he heard a parting shot fired at him by one of the females.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you will NEVER have me! Being so rude to my brother!&quot; Megan yelled after him, the incident from that morning forgotten.<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure this is a good idea, Master?&quot; Kaylee asked in the master bedroom as Fran and Darla returned.<br />
<br />
&quot;People will see you!&quot; Hope and Grace added nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't be helped,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;despite his age, great-grandpa has a tremendous amount of fight in him... partially why he will be the guardian of our pups. And I will need the tooth he chipped capped now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is going on?&quot; Darla asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Master has made an appointment to see the dentist,&quot; Isabelle spoke before Kaylee could, &quot;to have his canine capped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People will see you!&quot; the twins chorused.<br />
<br />
&quot;People saw me before,&quot; Jensen shrugged, &quot;when I walked to Kyle's house to make him become Kaylee. No one bothered to give me a second glance... at least not in anyway that would get me in trouble. I think some of the women I passed were turned on by me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're turned on by you,&quot; Kaylee smiled at her master. Her &quot;copies&quot; smiled beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Jensen answered with a smile of his own, although trying to hide the fact that half of his upper right canine was now missing, &quot;but I need the tooth capped, and since no one here is a practicing dentist, I will need a professional to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take Isabelle with you, at least Master,&quot; Kaylee offered, &quot;she still has her turn, should the dentist become uncooperative.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded and was about to get up when he noticed Zack slowly crawl past the door, whimpering slightly and looking very much embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must have gotten on Nicole's bad side,&quot; Jensen commented as Zack did not stop but continued on his way in the direction of the male's den to lick his wounds, metaphorically speaking.</p>
