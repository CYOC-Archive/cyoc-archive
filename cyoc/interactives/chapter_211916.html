<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trey, Stan, and Kenny were sitting in the living room, drinking beer and enjoying the party.<br />
<br />
They were Sophomores at the college and part of the Fraternity. Around them, people were dancing to the rather loud music. Well, less dancing, more talking in close groups and bobbing their bodies in time with the beat.<br />
<br />
It was strange, though. <br />
<br />
Trey swore that when the party started a few hours ago there’d been more people. Not that he was complaining. The amount of beautiful women with succulent tits and round asses had doubled somehow. Before it had basically been a sausage fest. Even the dudes were looking better, their cocks bulging down the sides of their jeans. <br />
<br />
He was a rather laid-back jock, all things considered. Trey wore an open shirt that showed off his perfectly sculpted abs, assets he took great pride in. His friend Stan was taller and weedier. The guy made him do all the housework. Kenny was a new pledge, though he was Brad’s little brother so basically a shoe in. Even had that tired look his brother had.<br />
<br />
“Man, where’s the rest of the frat?” Trey asked Stan, speaking loudly to be heard over the music.<br />
<br />
“Dunno. What’s up with all the… ” Stan waved over at the beautiful young women. “Like, have you ever seen them around before?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Trey frowned, studying the women closer. “They are incredibly hot, but… like, who are they and why are they here?”<br />
<br />
“Too hot.” Kenny spoke up.<br />
<br />
They both looked at him.<br />
<br />
“What? They just don’t seem real to me.” Kenny shrugged.<br />
<br />
They watched the party carefully now. Aside from the ditzy women strutting around in revealing dresses, very few of the guys from their Fraternity were here. Trey thought he saw an older man outside the window of the main room, dressed in a tweed suit. That was kinda weird.<br />
<br />
Beer bottles were everywhere, all unopened. Then the aforementioned well-endowed guys, a few from their frat, maybe 12 in total. They were vastly outnumbered by women. So much so that Trey was starting to wonder if this was a sorority. The lights flickered. They’d been doing that all night.<br />
<br />
When the lights came on again, he blinked. <br />
<br />
Something was missing. He wasn’t sure what, or who, but he’d been a quarterback in high school. Spotting small details meant the difference between a perfect pass or a fumble. And something had disappeared.<br />
<br />
The lights flickered again and there was a crash. <br />
<br />
“Damn!” Trey got up and hurried to the source of the noise.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, where are you off to?” Stan asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m the guy who has to clean this place after the party.” Trey called back.<br />
<br />
Trey rounded the corner and saw an antique vase lying on the floor, shattered. Two guys were laughing nearby, throwing a football around in the house. Trey ground his teeth. The last thing he needed right now was some other frat coming in here and breaking shit.<br />
<br />
“Hey, you two” Trey yelled.<br />
<br />
The two guys turned towards him as he approached, disdain in their eyes. <br />
<br />
“You just broke that vase. It’s priceless!” Trey spat.<br />
<br />
The jocks rolled their eyes and went back to tossing the football back and forth to each other. <br />
<br />
Trey opened his mouth to angrily tell them off when a warmth engulfed him.<br />
<br />
It was soft and tingly at first, coming in smooth waves, but it rapidly intensified into a heavy pounding that battered against his form. The lights flickered as the pulses picked up speed. Trey found that he couldn’t move, his arms and legs pulled together almost unnaturally, spine stiffening.<br />
<br />
He tried to cry out, but only a hollow exhale came out of his still-open mouth. He tried to close it, but his mouth seemed to stretch wider and wider, almost painful if not for the warmth tingling through his body. The world rose up around him and he realized he was shrinking.<br />
<br />
Trey’s belly bloated and pressed against his shirt moments before his clothes exploded into quickly disintegrating scraps, leaving him naked. His shrinking stopped, though the strange swelling and oddly tight feeling of his skin on his form continued.<br />
<br />
He found himself tilting his head backwards, mouth yawning open ever wider. His body began to harden and the last thing Trey saw before his face swirled across his body in a flow of blue ink was the ceiling high above him and a strange machine shining a beam down on him.<br />
<br />
Then all he saw was darkness. <br />
<br />
The waves continued, and the vase realized something was different about it. Was it…but the words escaped it. Many more would in the next few seconds as the waves battered its mind into submission.<br />
<br />
Then beautiful vase sat on the floor, unmoving, thoughts coming slow as the warm light receded. It wondered what had just happened. Some kind of beam had transformed him? It was so busy trying to think that it didn’t see the football as it came down and hit it.<br />
<br />
The vase had a brief moment of terror before it shattered, ceramic skittering across the floor. It was in exactly thirty seven pieces now, each one trying to think, desperate, but everything was so jumbled. Eventual, the mind inside it gave up, and the pieces quieted of all thought.<br />
<br />
“Ha! Broke another!” One of the jocks laughed.<br />
<br />
“Totally!” The other high fived him.<br />
<br />
“Let’s ditch this place before someone notices,” The first jock chuckled.<br />
<br />
Laughing, they left and wandered towards the living room.</p>
