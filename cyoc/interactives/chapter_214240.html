<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roger had to walk all the way back to the main terminal then out to gate 16. He walked as quickly as he could, concentrating on landing on his heels first. He was very aware of the alien feelings of his body as he moved. His breasts bounced despite wearing a bra and his bum wobbled. He acutely felt the void between his legs and was awfully aware of all the male eye’s watching him, apparently lusting after his body.<br />
<br />
Liz held his hand and helped steady him. It also helped that Liz’s carry on bag had wheels and a long handle, the bag functioned a bit like training wheels. As they walked Liz told him where to find her ticket and passport. They were in the side pocket of the deep green handbag currently hanging off Roger’s shoulder. The dress he was in had no pockets. <br />
<br />
When they finally got to the gate Liz said she needed to go to the toilets herself. Passengers were still queued up so he had time. Roger waited with Maureen aware of all the men checking him out. He found it quite disconcerting. Maureen spent that time suggesting to Roger that he needed to think of himself as a &quot;She&quot; and that her name was now “Liz”. ‘Otherwise you are likely to make a slip of the tongue. And remember the man who has gone to the toilet is my husband “Roger”. Roger thought this lecture a bit over the top but conceded that he would call Liz &quot;Roger&quot; when other people were around. They were going to be changing back in Dubai.<br />
<br />
Liz was very quick in the gents and seemed quite happy when he emerged, having used a public urinal for the first time. Roger realised immediately that he had just thought of Liz as a “he”. Perhaps he should start thinking of himself as a “she” it was very confusing.<br />
<br />
They lined up in the now diminished boarding queue and reached the front quite rapidly. Roger showed Liz’s boarding pass and passport to the attendant. He was immediately waved through. ‘The lower entry Miss Maguire’. It felt strange to be called Miss Maguire.<br />
<br />
Roger’s level of alarm rose slightly when they got onto the plane and he was ushered to the far side of the plane separated from Maureen and Liz were ushered to the near side. He had forgotten that he and Maureen had paid for extra legroom and that Liz would not be sitting with them. It was too late to do anything about that now. He found himself following the stragglers and looking for Liz’s seat 84 F. His hope that he might have a window seat was quickly dashed. ‘F’ seats were in the middle of the plane. Not even on an aisle.<br />
<br />
He waved across to Maureen and Liz, still waiting to move down the other aisle. Liz seemed so tall. She would be needing the extra leg room Roger had paid for. Roger consoled himself that now he was so much shorter, leg room would not be an issue. He watched as Liz stored his and Maureen’s carry-on bags in an overhead locker. They had found their seats. They were on an exit row, near a kitchenette at the rear of the plane. Good seats to have. Roger felt a bit envious. <br />
<br />
Rogers seat was only 4 rows further back but across the aisle. The seats either side of his were already occupied. He indicated to the man on the aisle seat where he needed to sit, then tried to raise Liz’s carry-on bag to the locker. To his embarrassment even in heels he wasn’t tall enough to see whether the locker had space or not. From what he could see there was a gap. His arms were now so much weaker as well. He had difficulty holding the bag above his head. Should he just thrust the bag up and hope there was space?<br />
<br />
The man in 84G had stood up and moved out into the aisle to allow Roger access to his seat. He must have realised Roger’s dilemma and said. ‘There is space there. Pointing to the locker across the aisle. Let me help you’ He took the bag off Roger and easily put it into the indicated locker. Not knowing what else to do with it, Roger also passed the man Liz’s green handbag. He placed that with the carry-on bag.<br />
<br />
‘Um. Thanks’<br />
<br />
Roger moved into Liz’s seat. There was a young girl perhaps Kirsty’s age on the far side. Roger found himself saying ‘Hi’ and smiling. It was disconcerting to hear the feminine voice come out of his mouth. The girl just gave a sort of grimace and spoke to a youth on her far side, totally ignoring Roger. Perhaps the girl was just disappointed that she no longer had a vacant seat beside her?<br />
<br />
Roger sat down and put the seat-belt on. His waist now was really quite tiny. He had to look past Liz&#39;s breasts to see the buckle. The temptation was to cup them with his hands and begin exploring this new body, but considering he was surrounded by strangers, he resisted. He didn&#39;t want to draw any more attention to himself.  What was pleasing was to see that even in the high heeled boots, his knees were several inches back from the seat in front. He hoped that the combination of the leg room and the fact that his bum now had so much extra padding meant that he would have a comfortable flight. <br />
<br />
He glanced across towards where he knew Maureen and Liz had their seats. He could not see them at all. He could not see over the seat in front of himself at all.<br />
<br />
Having resumed his seat, the man to Roger’s right introduced himself ‘Hi I’m Jack. It seems that we will get to spend a bit of time together’<br />
<br />
Roger offered his right hand for a shake. He was about to say “Roger” but stopped himself just in time. ‘I’m Liz, Liz Maguire. Nice to meet you’</p>
