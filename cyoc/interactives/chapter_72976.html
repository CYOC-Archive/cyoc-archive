<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nicolas had just left the hotel room and walked out on the sandy beach, taking in the warm air of the long <br />
shore before him. He had a week-long vacation in Southern Australia and he was determined to enjoy every <br />
minute of it. <br />
<br />
As he sat down in a deserted lounge chair, a young boy came running past him. The boy looked like he was about <br />
twelve years old, he had a tanned complexion and he had long sandy hair, which went just past his shoulders. <br />
The boy was tall and lanky for his age, and it looked like he had spent a lot of time on the beach. <br />
<br />
He ran into the water and went swimming for a while, just to emerge from the water, with his body glowing from <br />
the water dripping from his smooth skin. <br />
<br />
Nicolas somehow wanted the peace and quiet and he disliked having to share the beach with some young kid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you!&quot; he shouted at the boy in his thick, German accent. &quot;Go swim over there, on the other side of the <br />
beach!&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy just froze and stared at the man, with his deep, blue eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... I always swim here, Mister...&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care! Didn't you hear me? I'm staying at this hotel! I want you to swim over there! And if you don't <br />
do it then I will report you to the hotel manager! Now, go away!&quot; the German man sneered at the Aussie boy in <br />
an angry tone of voice.<br />
<br />
For what seemed like almost a minute, the young, Aussie boy stared at the tall German man with his deep, blue <br />
eyes. The boy looked up to him with a look of shock and disbelief. Who was this man, this foreigner, telling <br />
him where he could and couldn't swim? This boy had been swimming here all his life, and suddenly, out of <br />
nowhere, this man showed up and told him to go away.<br />
<br />
The boy, named Lance, quietly turned around and walked away. He ran towards the shore and ran further down, <br />
away from where the German man was sitting. <br />
<br />
&quot;There... I got rid of the pest&quot; Nicolas grinned. <br />
<br />
Just as Nicolas was going to enjoy some time sunbathing, he began to feel his bladder filling up with liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh crap! Now I need to take a piss. Where is the bathroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
The big German man then got up and walked towards the small building near the beginning of the beach, where <br />
there was a sign which said &quot;Restrooms&quot;. He looked for the sign by the door which said &quot;Men&quot; and he walked in. <br />
<br />
Once inside, he pulled down his beach shorts and relieved himself.  <br />
However, when he was done, he began to feel strange. As he looked down at his cock and his balls, he noticed <br />
something strange. Did his eight-inch cock suddenly seem... smaller?<br />
<br />
Then it struck him. His cock was shrinking! As he looked down, he realized that his cock was slowly getting <br />
smaller and smaller. It was dwindling down in size, shrinking down from 8 inches to 6 and finally down to 4, <br />
and now it was much thinner than before, losing all of its hair as well. His balls had shrunk as well!<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; he said, realizing that his voice had become a note higher, sounding like that of <br />
a kid.<br />
<br />
Next, his legs began to shrink down, as well as his arms and his torso. They became shorter and thinner, while <br />
he was losing his height and his muscle. His hair was disappearing from his chest, his arms, his legs and on <br />
his face. He was becoming completely smooth while the hair on his head grew a bit longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! What is happening?&quot; he shouted, now speaking with a slightly Australian accent rather than a German one.<br />
<br />
Nicolas now turned and stared at his reflection in the mirror on the wall. He was no longer a forty-year-old <br />
German man, but a thirteen year-old Australian boy with long, sandy hair and blue eyes!<br />
<br />
&quot;What's this? I'm supposed to be German!&quot; he said, as he tried to speak German and suddenly realized he <br />
couldn't say one word in his native language. &quot;I look like that kid!&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the door to the restroom opened and the Australian boy walked in. He was now the same height and age <br />
as the German boy. But the German boy was no longer German.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, Aaron! There you are! Come on! Let's go surfing!&quot; the Aussie boy said. Apparently, that was the boy's <br />
new name now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Lance!&quot; <br />
<br />
Then Lance and Aaron ran out and got their boards and hit the ocean.  <br />
There was no grumpy old German tourist to stop them from having their fun anymore.</p>
