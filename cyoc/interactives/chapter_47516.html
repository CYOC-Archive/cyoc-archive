<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once you have the wash hung out on the line and a second load in the machine, you notice that Lucy is getting restless from the sugared cereal she ate for breakfast, or as you like to think of it, hyper in a bowl. Not wanting to spend the day chasing her around the house and cleaning up whatever messes she might make, you decide that getting her out of the house is the best thing to do. If you're lucky she'll meet up with some friends at the park and end up exhausting herself so that when you get back home you can have a nice relaxed day.<br />
<br />
Before telling her that you're taking her to the park, you go up to your room and retrieve the magic flashlight from where you hid it, just in case you get the urge to play around with it while Lucy plays.<br />
<br />
Slipping it into your pocket, you head back to the living room where Lucy has her My Little Ponies and Barbie dolls, as well as several dozen little pokemon figurines spread out all over the floor. By the looks of it, her playing isn't much different as a girl as it was when she was a boy, as messy and hard to follow as ever.<br />
<br />
Careful not to step on and of her toys, still remembering what happened when your mom accidentally vacuumed up Pikachu while cleaning under the couch, you kneel down next to her, &quot;Hey, want to go to the park?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay! The park!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy jumps up and starts running towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast,&quot; you call out, &quot;We can't leave the living room a mess like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy frowns, but comes back to the living room, clearly she also remembers what happens when she leaves her toys around, though you were the one that suffered the worst during the Pikachu incident. You were the one who ended up having to take the vacuum apart to rescue the little toy, then try to get it back together and working again. Luckily you had been able to do so, but it was still a nerve wracking process, especially since Lucy, who at the time had been Luke, had been looking over your shoulder and crying that you'd better not hurt Pikachu.<br />
<br />
Once Lucy has all her toys put away you give the room a quick once over, making sure that there are no toys hiding under the furniture or stuck between the sofa cushions.<br />
<br />
Satisfied that everything is alright, you smile, &quot;Alright, let's go, but remember, stop and wait for me when we have to cross the street.&quot;<br />
<br />
The park's only about two blocks from where you live and Lucy has the way there memorized from all the times she's walked there with your mom.<br />
<br />
Like always, when she walks with you, you're the only one who walks, she's running far ahead, but at least she stops and waits when you have to cross the street, letting you hold her hand until you get to the other side, then running ahead again.<br />
<br />
Turning the last corner to before being in sight of the park, you start to speak, &quot;Now don't go running - &quot;<br />
<br />
But she's already gone, sprinting to the slide. With a sigh, you go find a bench to sit at where you can see the entire park and keep track of what Lucy is doing. It's still hard for you to remember that you turned your brother Luke into a girl, so you have to pay extra attention, just to be sure it's actually her you're watching and not some random little boy.<br />
<br />
While you watch your sister, you slip your hand into your pocket, feeling the magic flashlight, deciding whether to use it or not. You'd never use it on a kid, but there are a lot of parents around that might make good targets.<br />
<br />
You also notice a rather muscular man jogging laps around the park, and decide that he seems as promising a target as any. He's shirtless, which gives you an idea of where to start. Every time he runs past you, you decide that you'll shine the pink light on his chest, starting it at the lowest setting and turning it up slightly more intense each time.<br />
<br />
Taking a quick glance at Lucy and seeing that she's playing around the slide with three other little girls, you then turn your attention to the jogger.<br />
<br />
When he reaches the point in his lap of the park where he's closest to you, you quickly shine the light on his chest. At the sight of what happens, you have to hold back a laugh, his pectoral muscles all but vanish, softening and leaving his chest smooth and flat. He doesn't have breasts yet, but another lap or two and you expect that to change.<br />
<br />
You go back to watching Lucy, smiling at how she acts just like the other little girls she's playing with. Keeping her as a little girl for now seems like it'll be a lot of fun, or at least make life more interesting.<br />
<br />
The jogger comes by again, and this time when you shine the light on his chest his nipples grow larger and darker, perking up a bit and maybe the flesh around them puffs up slightly in the first sign of budding breasts.<br />
<br />
Now you divide the time you spend watching Lucy evenly with the time you spend watching the jogger, the changes to his chest and otherwise muscular body making him rather comical looking.<br />
<br />
The next lap past you leaves him with a decided bounce to his chest. If he doesn't end his daily jogging session soon, he won't be able to go shirtless anymore when it's all over. Already there's enough weight that he seems to be feeling it as he runs. Between looking at Lucy, you can see that he seems to be going a little slower, trying to keep his chest from jiggling so much.<br />
<br />
After another lap he has small, but noticeable breasts bouncing up and down as he runs. He actually has to stop and rub at them, wincing at the discomfort he must be feeling from all of the movement, but he still keeps going.<br />
<br />
Yet another lap, and this time it happens, a sports bra appears on his chest. Now that his breasts are supported, he's running faster again, but he also seems to notice that you're watching him. He doesn't seem suspicious though, if anything he seems pleased. Unnerved, you make a point of paying careful attention to Lucy until he comes closer to you. <br />
<br />
This time you try not to look at him when you shine the light, accidentally turning up the intensity all the way up to the maximum, causing his breasts to swell to what you guess to be a large, but still firm, d-cup.<br />
<br />
He slows down, stretching and wincing as he rubs his back, then adjusts his sports bra before walking over and sitting down next to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see?&quot; he flexes to show off the muscles of his arms, and pushes his chest forward to show off his cleavage to you.<br />
<br />
Despite yourself you laugh, and at the sound of your voice you realize why he's doing this. You've completely forgotten that you've turned yourself into a girl, albeit a tomboy.<br />
<br />
Since you still have the flashlight and a through understanding of its power, you decide to play along, though you turn it down to its lowest pink setting to be ready in case things go wrong, &quot;Well, I'll admit, I've never seen a guy with d-cup breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
To your surprise he takes this in stride correcting you with a smile, &quot;They're probably closer to a double d, but standard sizing doesn't really work for me, for obvious reasons. I just wear sports bras. But it's pretty obvious that you really don't care about bras.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure of what to say, you just nod, glancing over your shoulder to be sure that Lucy is still playing. She's moved over to the swings, but is still playing with the same group of girls. When you turn back to the jogger, you realize that he keeps quickly glancing downward, as though trying not to let you notice what he's doing. Without thinking you look downwards as well and discover what he's looking at, it's cool enough out that your nipples are visible through your t-shirt.<br />
<br />
Like any other guy caught in the act, he looks away, but not before you decide that you'll have to fix things. First though, you want to learn a bit more about the way he thinks, &quot;Why are you so interested in what little I've got when you have so much more?&quot;<br />
<br />
He actually laughs at this, &quot;Are you interested in your own breasts? besides there's a lot more to you than your breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stop to think about this for a moment, and realize that since you've become a girl, you have no interest in your own body, despite still finding women attractive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah!&quot; the jogger laughs and you realize that you've been looking at his breasts.<br />
<br />
Deciding that things have gone on for long enough, you shine the flashlight between his legs on its lowest pink setting. Based oh what happened when you were messing around with the light on Gene, you've probably changed the man's anatomy to that of a woman, but removed his sex drive.<br />
<br />
As though to prove that his anatomy has changed, he crosses his legs, just like a woman and smiles at you, this time showing much less interest, &quot;Well, it was nice talking to you, but I've got to get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watch him walk away and shake your head. You almost feel bad for what you've done to him, leaving him a muscular man with enormous breasts, female parts between his legs and no sex drive, but at the same time, the light does change reality. No one will see him as being strange and he'll be happy with who he is, having no idea of what he's missing.<br />
<br />
Done with playing around with the light for the day, you go over and get Lucy to tell her that she has to say goodbye to her friends, she frowns, but is obviously tired, and does as you say.<br />
<br />
For the walk home she's tired enough that she stays by your side the whole way, and when you get home she goes right to her room. This leaves you able to take the clothing off the line, fold it and then hang out the next load. There's still a few hours before you expect your parents to get home, so you decide to call your girlfriend to see if you can get together either tonight or tomorrow. You're pretty sure that her mom is away on a business trip for a week, so if you go to her house, you can have all sorts of fun.<br />
<br />
She picks up on the third ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Stacy, it's me. How's it going?&quot; you ask, trying to figure out how to frame your request to get together.<br />
<br />
She recognizes your voice due to the change to reality and laughs, &quot;Hey back at you. It's going. Work's a nightmare, Joe called in sick last minute. He's got the flue or something, so I'll be closing the store for the next five days at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
Discovering that she's going to be working nights really ruins your plans, but you decide you can wait, after all you can stay a girl for as long as you want to. For a moment you consider changing yourself back to a guy until you can get together with Stacy, but decide against it. You might as well stay a girl since the wait will probably make things more fun when you finally get the chance.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's too bad,&quot; you try to keep the disappointment out of your voice, &quot;Joe always does that to you, doesn't he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she snorts dismissively, &quot;He'll do anything he can to get out of having to work nights and if he can make me miserable in the process, well, he thinks that's a bonus.&quot;<br />
<br />
This confuses you, &quot;Wait, I thought Joe liked you. isn't he always trying to get you to dump me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow, yeah,&quot; she bursts into giggles, &quot;He's such a guy, you know? He just doesn't get it that I'm not interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
You laugh at this as well, though this time it's one of relief, before you were rather nervous that she actually would leave you for Joe, but now it seems the changes to reality you made when you turned yourself into a girl are working in your favor. All the more reason to stay a woman until you get the chance to have some fun, &quot;Is he really that bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, I guess it's just that he's getting on my nerves. he seems to think that because I'm not going out with a guy I'm not going out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you try telling him you're not interested in guys?&quot; you offer.<br />
<br />
This makes her giggle again, &quot;Not interested in guys? What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; suddenly, you're nervous that you made some sort of mistake by changing yourself, &quot;I thought we were...&quot;<br />
<br />
You trail off, not sure how to say that you're convinced that the two of you should be dating without sounding strange if you aren't thanks to the changes to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be silly, of course you're my girlfriend, but that doesn't make me a lesbian or anything,&quot; she seems to realize how silly this sounds, for when she continues she corrects herself, &quot;Well, maybe I'm bi or something like that, but really, you're the only girl I've ever been interested in. Until I met you, I never even thought of a girl in a sexual way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; you ask intrigued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, but I guess back when we first met in high school there was something different about you. I mean when I first saw you I thought you were a guy, you dress and act so much like one,&quot; by the sound of her voice, you can tell that Stacy is getting ready to tell the whole story of how you met, which is fine by you since you want to know about the changes in reality, &quot;Then I got a good look at you and saw that you had breasts and it actually made me sad. I mean I was still interested in you, but thought that because you were a girl you'd never ask me out. I still felt the same way around you that I would around a guy, I mean I'm not interested in girls at all, you were just different. Then, when you came over to me and asked me out I thought I would faint and you know the rest from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The whole story confuses you, but you decide to go along with it, &quot;Yup, I guess we're both just lucky.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of you talk for a little longer, but then she has to get ready for work, so you say your goodbyes and wait for your parents to get home.</p>
