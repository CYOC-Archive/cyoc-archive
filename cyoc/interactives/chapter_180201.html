<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlie Zade was not exactly what most people would call a very moral man.<br />
<br />
His tenure through high school was marked by his silver tongue, tendencies of stealing from his school mates, and then trying to charm his way out of trouble, regardless what he had to do. He and the equally crooked vice principal even engaged in a sexual tryst once or twice, him holding his minor age over her, and she held his criminal deeds over him. It was a relationship made in blackmail and reinforced through unhealthy multiple returns.<br />
<br />
Charlie had grown into even more of a criminal after high school. A conman, a robber, a swindler and a thief, Charlie considered himself a dashing rogue. But...well, in actuality the only thing good that might be said about Charlie was the fact that he was &quot;dashing&quot;. After high school, his body it seemed puffed up with muscle, growing tall and strong. Even now, he maintained the fitness routine that let him achieve his physique - which was in part what let him be as successful in his business as he was.<br />
<br />
A few scars lined his body from less than wise picked fights. His gear included a face obscuring mask, making it difficult to suss out his identity, a black hooded jacket, a black stringer tank top (if not greed, it was vanity that powered Charlie Zade), black cargo pants stocked with a number of utility pieces for thieving and robbing purposes, and boots. Charlie had light brown, curly hair, baby blue eyes that spoke to an innocence that never existed, and handsome features only slightly marred by a scar on his jawline.<br />
<br />
Charlie remembered beating six shades of tar out of the &quot;temporary working partner&quot; for marring his handsome visage.<br />
<br />
Well, now Charlie was in something of a desperate strait. The cops had wised up, and were on the look out for him in this state recently, and none of his fake identities were working. He&#39;d used his latest car to the breaking point, and now here he was out in the boonies. Nobody came out here. No cops. No authorities. No sheriffs. Just farms and cows and horses as far as the eye could see.<br />
<br />
Charlie knelt in front of the door, checked left and right, and took out one of his tools. He started finnicking with the lock, and grinned when he heard the lock click open. &quot;Easy money, Charlie Zade. Easy money, you got this.&quot; He walked inside cautiously. He didn&#39;t see anyone home for at least the last week while he cased the place. Either the owners were using this as a meth hub or something like that, or this was for whatever reason an abandoned house.<br />
<br />
And what a pity they&#39;d abandon this place.<br />
<br />
Charlie was immediately taken with the two story farmhouse, grinning as he looked around and checked the area out. Maintaining caution but, over time, starting to relax a bit. He fixed the lock on the front door and locked the door behind him. Thinking immediately about how odd this all was. It looked like all the lights and electricity worked around here. Probably added early and updated, but curiously no sign of life recently.<br />
<br />
Charlie moved over into the kitchen to further check things out.<br />
<br />
The fridge was still stocked, just...mostly with fruits and vegetables. Not that much meat in there. Which raised its own questions. Who bought this stuff? And was any of it still good? He gave the food a sniff to check if anything was up. It all seemed good in there. Just...again. Weird dieting habit for whoever bugged the fuck out and ran outta there. Charlie crossed his arms and thought about it...and then took off his mask.<br />
<br />
He threw it on to the kitchen table and took a seat at the picturesque kitchen table, putting his legs up on another chair, &quot;Just like home sweet home...just...home out on the range.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie decided to go check and see if the amenities were in good condition, and about any of the bedrooms. The whole place was oddly warm for a place that wasn&#39;t really seemingly maintained by anyone. It was almost magical. As Charlie headed upstairs into the bedroom, he looked around and thought about it. He could see the windows were all mostly closed and shuttered, the blinds down. Before long he took off his jacket and shirt, standing there in the bedroom shirtless.<br />
<br />
Charlie Zade flexed his muscles briefly, enjoying how strong and well built he was. He looked forward to introducing the farm wives around this area to his charming act. He wondered if any of them had anything worth much in their checkbooks. Though even getting some fucking done after so long on the run would definitely be welcome. Charlie lightly slapped his growing erection, chuckling at how easy it was to get hyped up after you were left living on the road for so long.<br />
<br />
Charlie kept investigating the rest of the home, eager to see if there might be something he could do with all of this. He barely noticed a strange, all black figure outside looking in at him. The Black Stallion, seeing this sudden intruder, and getting some very interesting ideas for expanding his herd...</p>
