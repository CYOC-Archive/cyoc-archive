<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well rested from my nap with Larry, I slowly woke up, ready to fix the mistake I&#39;d written in the book earlier. I opened my eyes: eigengrau. There was a bit of pressure behind my head. Had Larry blindfolded me? I pulled a hand towards my face, hearing some rattling against whatever it was attached to. Muffles came out of my mouth, which had been stuffed with what felt was a sock.<br />
<br />
Strong steps shook the ground as they approached. Fuck, was it Larry? Oh god, he had a lot of explaining to do if it he was the one who put me in those handcuffs. I kept trying to undo whatever restraints my legs and hands we caught in, shaking to free myself, with no luck. After a few moments, I noticed nothing was giving any slack. I gave up for now.<br />
<br />
A booming laugh echoed through the room, &quot;Fuck, you queers are so eager for the hog, it&#39;s insane. Just a bit of affection and bam! Complete trust.&quot; The voice sounded like Larry&#39;s, yet much deeper and sensual. There was a tinge of contempt in his tone, coupled with an arousing timbre. My small nub twitched at the sound of it, turned on by how sultry it was. I moaned through the stuffing in my mouth as it rubbed again the textile it laid on. &quot;Found your book by the way. I saw how big my cock is now, thanks for that, runt. When I touched the page it all made sense.&quot; My thighs felt the warmth of Larry&#39;s body as a part of it grazed my balls. One of his thick fingers surrounded my small cock, teasing it with a few pulls. My breathing accelerated as he jerked me off with a few strokes. Shivers ran through my spine, my head clouded in the pleasure of the sensation. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got the biggest cock around, so I guess I get to thank you.&quot; Larry&#39;s free hand covered my left inner thigh, squeezing the erogenous zone as his other hand slowly rubbed me off.  Fuck that felt good. My balls throbbed. If he kept this up, I&#39;d shoot a small load soon... &quot;There&#39;s one thing I still don&#39;t get,&quot; he said, letting go of my nub before tracing lines on my tiny balls. &quot;You could&#39;ve also made my balls bigger, you fucking idiot.&quot; He flicked one of them, groans of pain trying to leave my mouth. I spasmed against the restraints holding me in place, soreness taking hold of my testicle. Larry&#39;s bushy beard caressed the nape of my neck as he sensually whispered into my ear, &quot;I fixed it myself, same number.&quot; I moaned through the sock as he bit my earlobe, a spurt of precum shooting out of my cock. <br />
<br />
Fuck, Larry knew how to play me like a fiddle. Part of me wondered what else he&#39;d done with the book, or if he hadn&#39;t gotten that far yet. &quot;Enjoying yourself?&quot; I slowly shook my head, still somewhat shaken by the pain and pleasure he&#39;d just inflicted on me. He&#39;d already moved around the bed I was attached to, his body back to radiating heat behind me. He placed both hands on my legs, his breathing lightly tickling the small of my back. His hands massaged my legs before slowly moving onto my asscheeks.<br />
<br />
An avalanche of memories submerged my brain as Larry kneaded my pillowy bottom. Recollections played in my mind&#39;s eye, all centered on one thing: my ass. My thick, plump ass. My massive bubble butt, my single best attribute. It was made to be touched, to be groped, to be used. The tons of thongs I&#39;d worn over the years, just to show it off to everyone. The amount of times I went to the gym in booty shorts that were barely decent to work it out. Core memories shifted to be about my ass. I&#39;d just started college, but it had already gotten a good amount of use. Stairwells, washrooms, empty classes, I&#39;d gotten fucked everywhere. There was an hunger in it I couldn&#39;t sate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, stop that daydreamin&#39;,&quot; Larry barked at me. My arms and legs were stretching the handcuffs, pulling them taut. I breathed heavily, panting as I returned to focus on my current state. I moaned through the sock in my mouth, &quot;Aahee, eeze, eeze.&quot; He intensified his massage, getting my nub throbbing in an instant. My butt quivered, squeezing the air around it. Larry giggled, &quot;He he, remember the trouble you had with my cock earlier?&quot; I whimpered, thinking back on how difficult it was to get even a few inches in. He took a breath and blew between my fat buttcheeks.<br />
<br />
My body rocked once again, as a small gust of air entered my ass. The electrifying sensation of my brain adapting to its new reality took all my focus. I&#39;d started with small dildos, prostate massagers and the like. Quickly enough, I started enjoying widening my anus more. Feeling it stretch against bigger toys. I was known as the size queen around college, guys frequently giving me notes to meet them around campus, each promising me with a good fuck. I started wearing buttplugs on the daily, so I&#39;d be ready all the time. Months later, I realized my ass was gaping wider and wider permanently. Thankfully, that made hitting my prostate easier when I wanted to, basically all the time since it was harder to find fuckfriends girthy enough to stretch me out further.<br />
<br />
Larry&#39;s finger circled my loose opening with a finger, while he kept squeezing one of my buttcheeks. &quot;Likin&#39; this?&quot; I moaned in pleasure through the sock in my mouth, feeling my landlord&#39;s digit explore the entrance to my back. He didn&#39;t hesitate putting more fingers in, with four fitting effortlessly. Larry&#39;s massaged my muscles, slowly widening his fingers around, working my opening up. My nub throbbed, leaking precum as I flexed my opening along with Larry&#39;s rhythm. &quot;Now that&#39;s a good hole.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was another pulse in my head. My parents wanted to call me Kole; the nurse who filed the paperwork was a complete idiot. It was easiest to just go with their mistake, since my parents didn&#39;t have the time or attention to go to court to fight it. On the bright side, introducing myself to men in clubs was extremely easy. I&#39;d give them my name, and they&#39;d know instantly who I was, what I was. I&#39;d sometimes go by some super bland name like Jason when I was out with friends, just to avoid making myself the center of attention. Then those friends would use my namesake in the alley once we were done drinking. I had a weird ass name, but it fit who I was.<br />
<br />
I was getting stretched further by Larry&#39;s hand. He wiggled his fingers around, touching my inner walls, getting them ready for him. &quot;Hole&#39;s a hole, ain&#39;t he?&quot; I tried answering him &quot;Yes,&quot; muffling through the sock still lodged in my mouth. Larry took his hand out of my wide open hole, squeezing both my thick pillowy asscheeks afterwards. <br />
<br />
He freed one of his hands, the unmistakable sound of precum slicking his shaft in a few strokes ringing through the room. &quot;Let&#39;s see what the new improved Hole Gray can do, ha ha,&quot; he laughed as a thump resonated from the mattress behind me. I felt him against my asshole, his wet cockhead sliding into my barely resistant backend. It was so hard for me not to cum right there and then. Inch by inch, Larry inserted himself in my spacious ass. He grabbed my waist with both hands and walked forward. He was spilling precum inside, his girthy, monumental tool pulsing as more of it occupied me. <br />
<br />
A few inches in, and his cock was now touching my prostate. I felt my nub spurt a glob of cum, dripping out onto the bed sheet under me. With more of Larry entering me, the pressure on my prostate was now constant. His dick was rubbing it one way, sending wave after wave of pleasure through my spine. My balls were working overdrive as I gasped and moaned through the sock, precum pouring out of my nub at a slow rate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Halfway... Hnng... Halfway there.&quot; Larry started shoving his dick in me faster. Every inch filling me up as he throbbed against whatever little resistance my innards gave him. My arms and legs were shaking from the pleasure my prostate was provided with. Our moans and groans were filling the room as his dick pushed harder into me. Before long, his pubes touched my asscheeks. That&#39;s when I got to understand the size of Larry&#39;s new balls as they landed on the bed. I didn&#39;t know exactly how big they were, but they were heavy enough to make the mattress squeak under their weight. Larry took the sock out of my mouth as his beard touched the back of my neck. He licked and bit my ear. &quot;Fuck, I&#39;m so... Ahhh... So full Larry. You&#39;re stretching me so... so good,&quot; I panted, squeezing my ass around the root of his cock. &quot;Oh ahhhhhh,&quot; he blew a breathe against my ear, &quot;fuuuck, mmhhhmm, good thing your easy gay ass moved in.&quot;<br />
<br />
My brain throbbed. Larry was the best thing that happened to me this year. I was looking for an apartment near campus to rent mid-semester; whatever funds I had for on-site housing has dried up, thanks to a few too many nights at the hottest clubs in town. Browsing Gregslist, I ran into an ad for a room to rent in the area I wanted. The building looked great, and most importantly it was ridiculously cheap. It was an odd ad when I read it, with things like &quot;attractive 47yo man, must be 25 and under, may have to share bed, no prudes.&quot; I booked a visit, wearing a mesh crop-top and the shortest booty shorts I could find. When Larry came to pick me up in the building&#39;s lobby, he was only wearing overly-stretched swimming briefs, leaving barely none of his crotch to the imagination. The moment he saw me, he licked his lips. The widest shit-eating grin I&#39;d ever seen on someone shone on his face. He walked up to me, his cock throbbing, stretching his briefs before he snickered and said &quot;You&#39;ll take both today.&quot; And I did.<br />
<br />
I was still chained up to our bed, Larry kissing my neck lovingly as I panted. My hole squeezed my roommate and landlord&#39;s cock involuntarily as a mixture of chuckles and groans booming in my ear. &quot;Sounds like you&#39;re uhnnfff... Ready?&quot; he whispered slowly. I gripped his dick as hard as I could with my ass, unable to find the words to reply. Moving his head away from mine, he slapped my buttcheeks. &quot;AH!&quot; I yelped. He grabbed my waist. Then he began.<br />
<br />
His cock pulled back, rubbing my prostate on the way out. &quot;Hmmmm, yeaaaahhhh,&quot; we both moaned in unison. He pushed it back in swiftly. &quot;Good Hole,&quot; he purred between breaths. My legs started shaking alongside the friction on my prostate. A stream of precum was staining the sheets under my cocklet. Larry repeated his movements a bit faster. I let out a high pitched whine. He sped up again. And again. And again. Pleasured whines constantly left me. Larry&#39;s rumbling groans echoed in the room. My balls throbbed, just like my hole. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhh, hnnggggg mhhmmmmm,&quot; I let out as my balls emptied themselves. &quot;Hnggg, sensiti-awe yeahhh bitch,&quot; he chuckled between strokes. Larry pushed all of his cock in me, pubes grazing my ass yet again as his tool throbbed. He deserved a good milking today, I flexed my hole tight against him, hoping to drain his hefty balls. <br />
<br />
Just as I was holding him as firmly as I could, he pulled part of his dick out. &quot;FUCK YEEEAAAAH, KEEP IT HMMMMM TIGHT,&quot; the room shook as his stroking resumed, intensified. My entire willpower was focused on flexing my hole for him. Every inch of his cock rubbing my prostate was sending shivers up my spine, trying to have me fail at my task. Larry groaned with his movements. I was making sure he was satisfied with my ass; I was with his cock. As he kept stroking, his breathing became irregular. He was nearly done. With one last thrust, he bottomed out; his crotch against my ass, his balls in a puddle of my cum. He pulled on my waist, the entirety of his cock filling my insatiable ass. <br />
<br />
He throbbed, and throbbed. And throbbed. His cum had a lot of cock to travel, but once it finished its trip, it filled me up. <br />
<br />
Warm, gooey, Larry&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooohhh...&quot; he groaned, &quot;won&#39;t get tired of that fruity ass.&quot; His balls were still throbbing when he started pulling out of me. Deep within, his seed was leaving a nice trail behind. Emptiness was filling me. Precum was leaking from my nub as Larry&#39;s shaft rubbed my prostate on the way out. Nearly out, he left his cockhead inside a bit, so I could milk the last few drops of cum from it. I flexed my ass as best as I could, feeling his essence seep into me. &quot;Good slut, now that&#39;s room service,&quot; Larry gloated as he started undoing my restraints.<br />
<br />
Soon enough my legs were sore but free. I moved them around with difficulty, seeing I&#39;d probably been stuck like this for hours. Larry walked around our bed, undoing the handcuffs around my hands. I stretched them in circles, hoping the pain around my wrists would fade shortly. <br />
<br />
I lifted myself up, turning around in the bed to sit up. The bed creaked as Larry sat against the headboard. He pulled my waist to line my ass with his leg, dragging me close to him as a trail of cum coated him. &quot;Can&#39;t have you sit on these balls,&quot; he whispered behind me. My ass was against his hip as I sat on him, his wide cock touching my left buttcheek. He placed his arms around my stomach, one of his hands tracing around my nub and small sack of balls. &quot;You fill me uuuhhhhhp so good Laahhhhrry,&quot; I softly let out as he kissed my neck and rubbed my cock with one finger. He moved his free hand away, removing the blindfold I still had on.<br />
<br />
He chuckled, &quot;Thanks, I&#39;m not done with you yet.&quot;</p>
