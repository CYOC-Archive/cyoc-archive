<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“In you go, and listen to Jasper, let him teach you how to graze,” Bob said, as did the horse Jasper take control of the horse body and marched out into the green grassy pasture.  “And now then the wife, as I know there will be some hell to pay for what happened, became of my son and her boy!”<br />
<br />
Bob Morrison reset the pasture gate latch to keep the gate as closed, latched, and locked shut. He turned and then let out a sigh of feeling determined to tell his wife more about was is as it will be, while she might make use of her biblical knowledge to ask some hard questions. As it was a long walk from the pasture gate, having to pass by the corrals and then the barn to walk inside the farmhouse.<br />
<br />
As Bob had walked almost to the farmhouse, he remembered the Medallion that he had left as setting on the top rail, to the stall wall of Jasper’s stall. When he grabbed it off the wooden rail and held it in his hand the Medallion spirit came alive again. “Please my Master, I wish to learn if your dear wife accepted that rather detailed description of what the curse did to your son?”<br />
<br />
“Yes and no, as yes she was very diplomatic while our son was there and listening. She told me to take my handsome stallion to the pasture, and let then Jasper show Jared the eating style known as grazing. I am requested to go now to the house and have a conversation with the wife; so if you would care enough to back me up, as inform my wife what I told her was the truth, I would be grateful!” Bob said, as he slipped the Medallion into his shirt pocket.<br />
<br />
“Master,” the Medallion spirit began again to speak, as suggested, “It was said that a picture was worth a thousand words of explaining; so why not take along a horse blanket to drape about your wife’s shoulders and then toss her the Medallion and let the curse inform her of what is her new reality?”<br />
<br />
“What,” exclaimed Bob, as he then said, “No, like no thanks, as I love my wife for being the woman I married and not a mare to use for her bodily strength!”<br />
<br />
“She would remain as yours even after she became as a mare or if you wish, a castrated male donkey, as mattering upon your favoring of sexual partners?” Said the Medallion spirit, and Bob thought he heard the Spirit give a soft chuckling laugh.<br />
<br />
“You really like to pull on the devil’s string, as ready to doom and damn my wife to being an animal, a horse or pony mare, and/or a gelded male donkey, as if I would want to mess sexually with any mares or fondle a donkey…,” Bob angrily said as replied, slapping a broad hand to smack the face of the Medallion.<br />
<br />
Bob opened the door to the farmhouse and proceeded to walk inside and to a Donnybrook style argument with his wife.<br />
<br />
“Marg, I am in the house!” Bob yelled aloud, he not knowing where his wife might then be as was waiting.<br />
<br />
“In the living room, and don’t forget to remove your barn boots, as my kitchen floor got mopped this morning.”  The Misses brashly reminded her husband as not to make more of a mess than they had then to concern their future.<br />
<br />
“Debra called for Jared; she wants him to take her to the new Brad Pitt movie at the Cinema. I told her that I would tell my son and he would call her back; so how will he accomplish that, hmmm…?” Marg asked of her husband Bob.<br />
<br />
“Okay, this is Tuesday, as either of us giving her a call back and inform her that Jared is away on farm business and is expected back home by Friday night at eight, and will pick her up for the 9:00 pm showing.” Bob said with a impish grin.<br />
<br />
“Cute, and you really expect a devil-demon curse to let go its hold on our son for a weekend of people style fun and going to church?” Marg argued, as she slid from the coffee table to setting on her lap was their family Bible.<br />
<br />
“That was what the Medallion so specified about what it said Jarred got an agreement with the devil who began the curse. As it seems Jared reminded the devil of what he caught with his cursing our son. He told of my grandpa being a minister, and his brother was a missionary. He doubled his deal by mentioning our you and me being Sunday school teachers, and our religious beliefs tended to make the devil lean to give Jared enough leverage to allow him to attending of church, and being human on every-other weekend.<br />
<br />
Jared must share the horse body with Jasper, and by doing so each life entity gets to play through a weekend; this according to how the Medallion tells of the agreement.<br />
<br />
If you were to ask me about my gaining back Jasper but at the cost of my fine son, the answer is no, I wish had not happened, but it did!” Bob thought to tell all before his dear wife would start a religious argument.<br />
<br />
“What I want to know is exactly how this Medallion did entrap my son to become a horse, and a stallion?”<br />
<br />
No don’t answer me just yet, as I know from what was said about the curse as originated by a devil tends to prove the actuality of the Almighty. Therefore, I called our Pastor and he is coming today at 4:30 pm to talk to us about devils and curses.” Marg said, and added, “Now if you would, go upstairs and take a hot shower, get clean and properly dressed for meeting the reverend. Toss your clothes in the wash hamper and I will run a load before the reverend arrives.”<br />
<br />
Bob quickly responded with his usual, “Yes dear!”<br />
<br />
Robert went to the upstairs second floor and while get got undressed and ready to enter the shower stall, he happened to see his dear wife walking toward the barn. As Bob looked; he happened to notice the twinkle of sunlight glimmer on something silvery as shinny held by the right hand of his wife.<br />
<br />
“NO, no, no, Margery no,” Bob yelled as he donned on his jockey shorts underwear and being half naked did rush down stairs, as rustle-run toward the barn to find…</p>
