<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While things were strange, Edwin was beginning to feel that spending a year as a fat older gentleman may not turn out to be the worst thing in the world. And yet... something was missing, he felt. He looked down at his porcine left hand, noting for a moment how thick and broad it was on this 5&#39;2&quot; obese, big-gutted frame. He noticed the slight discoloration over his ring finger. Apparently, in this reality, he&#39;d worn a ring in the past. He tried to rack his brain for some crumb of memory but it just came in blurry smears. There&#39;d been a partner... something had gone wrong after years of marriage... and his father, er, his son now, had been left in his custody. Edwin didn&#39;t like that. He hadn&#39;t even had a real girlfriend yet and here he was, already divorced!<br />
<br />
Well, I know how to fix that, he thought, a clever smile creeping over his bearded face. If he couldn&#39;t change who he was for the next year, at the very least he could change the things around him to make things happier for him. After all, shouldn&#39;t he get some actual enjoyment from that damn Chronivac after it played such a dirty trick on him?<br />
<br />
Edwin started the long process of making his way back to his room. It was still a new, strange experience to feel all of his blubber shifting around his body with each footstep, his love handles pouring out over his sides, his bulk being lightly restrained by his stretchy suspenders. He was starting to enjoy the feeling of the straps rubbing up against the sides of his gut, framing it, making it look even bigger and rounder upfront. He liked it so much he could feel his cock pulse a bit buried between his fupa and the overhang of his gut proper. Feeling all the fat surrounding it jiggle and vibrate as he walked to the stairs certainly didn&#39;t help calm things down.<br />
<br />
When he got to the foot of the stairs, he looked up and swallowed hard. Going down the stairs had been challenging enough due to how heavy he was and how quickly he built up inertia, but now to go up the stairs...? He knew already what a chore it was to just walk around the house normally, his tonnage turning a few dozen steps into a cardio workout. He also knew based on the creaks he felt getting up out of his chair earlier that his joints had aged just as much as the rest of him. Still, he didn&#39;t see an elevator, so he&#39;d have to just man up. He took his first step up and grunted audibly as he hoisted his pounds up, working hard to push his heavy body against gravity. His knee and ankle ached, but he had to keep going. <br />
<br />
He continued his trek upward, sweat starting to form on the top of his bald head as he panted, slowly making progress until he finally found himself at the top of the stairs, out of breath, but triumphant. He had gone through a workout just getting up to his room! If he did that enough, he&#39;d certainly work off a bit of this jelly, he thought, reaching down to rub his blubber. Somehow, the thought of losing any of his size was... unpleasant to him. But didn&#39;t he hate the idea of being fat? Well, the young part of him did. He thought it was the ultimate symbol of laziness, a sign of a fundamental character flaw. What kind of man couldn&#39;t control his weight? Edwin had a feeling the older him would have a snappy comeback to that.<br />
<br />
After dabbing his head and face with his handkerchief again, he resumed his journey back to his room and closed the door behind him after once again being slightly nervous about whether or not his belly would clear the sides of the doorway. He settled into the roller chair in front of his computer with a satisfied grunt and took out his readers to look at the Chronivac screen once again. He searched around trying to find what he was looking for. Thankfully, this was one occasion where young Edwin was of benefit to the elder. Edwin had fuzzy memories of not being good with computers and having to hunt and peck when he typed things, but teenage Edwin had no such limitations. He scrolled through the list of available nearby subjects (his family), and saw the option he was looking for: Create New Subject.<br />
<br />
He clicked on it and was brought to a screen that didn&#39;t look all that dissimilar from create-a-character screens from video games his teenage self used to play. Of course, the old, obese Edwin hadn&#39;t ever touched a video game in his life, not even Pong back in the day! There was a name field, but Edwin didn&#39;t want to name his creation before getting a chance to look at it. Below that was Gender. He almost didn&#39;t notice how his cursor had glided over to the Male option and had clicked it. He almost moved on to the next part before he did a double-take and realized what he&#39;d done. Wait, why was he trying to make a guy? Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to make a woman? he asked himself. But when tried to hover over the Female option, his finger refused to click on it. No matter how hard he tried, this body didn&#39;t want to make a female partner. Oh no, Edwin realized, the teenager&#39;s blood running cold. Am I a gay old man? Suddenly, his erections when he thought about his body made sense. He was a man attracted to men now! <br />
<br />
Still, Edwin reasoned, there was little he could do to change that. The transformation was locked in for a year and that was that. Might as well enjoy this walk on the wild side, a more wise, experienced side of himself decided. He continued through the screen and saw the next option was Build. He scrolled through the options with his right hand while his left began idly rubbing his belly, making a comforting moan emanate from his flabby chest that he hardly noticed. His nose scrunched up at the slimmer, more petite builds. That&#39;s not what he was looking for in a man. He had ended up rather enjoying his own wide, sturdy frame, and so he wanted any partner of his to share the same. He selected an option that had broad shoulders and chest, big hands, and feet. Next came Height. Edwin wasn&#39;t sure why he felt this way, but he knew his partner needed to be taller... much taller. He input the value &quot;6 feet 6 inches&quot; and could feel his mouth starting to water. How much of a size difference would that be? Would he even come up to this man&#39;s shoulders? Likely not! And that excited him, he thought, as his cock tingled buried under his belly.<br />
<br />
Next came facial features. He picked round kind eyes and made them blue. He&#39;d always liked very clear blue eyes. Next was a nose. He found that the older Edwin inside of him liked his men to have distinguished-looking noses and so this one would have quite a prominent, dignified-looking schnozz sticking off of his face. Edwin was less choosy with a mouth because, well... he knew he&#39;d barely be able to see it once he was done. Next came Hair. Again, Edwin the Elder had very clear tastes and he chose male pattern baldness much like his own, clear up top with fringes around the sides of the head. The hair color was blond... at least originally, Edwin chuckled to himself, the action making his belly jiggle considerably, giving his hand resting on top of it a jostle. Along with the hair on his head came the hair on the rest of his body. Edwin licked his mustachioed lips. He wanted body hair on his man, all right... a lot of it. He pushed the slider farther and farther to the right, watching a preview to the side of the screen that showed where the hair would be growing. At first, there was nothing at all, then a dusting over his chest, then his chest and forearms, his pubes growing a little wilder and rising in a treasure trail... then further up his arms, over to his shoulders, down his back, over his butt, down his legs, over his knuckles, even his facial hair was getting thicker, would grow faster. On top of that body hair, he made sure this man&#39;s facial hair would be voluminous, grown out large and majestically. He reached up to stroke fingers through his bushy beard. This older Edwin knew what turned his crank, young Edwin decided.<br />
<br />
Next came the option that the old pervert inside of him had truly been waiting for. Sure, this fantasy man had a burly frame, but what would that frame be filled with. He pushed the slider for muscle a bit to the right and saw the biceps and deltoids and pectorals on the model on the screen start to swell up, giving an athletic base to things. While Edwin knew the body that he currently had had never so much as even exerted itself physically more than having to walk up a flight of stairs, the one he was making looked like it could be a collegiate athlete, with strong thighs and glutes, firm musculature. Of course, he wasn&#39;t going to stop there. <br />
<br />
His mouse scrolled over to the slider regulating fat and he gently began guiding that slider further to the right. As he did so, he could see the model thicken, the pecs soften, the definition of biceps and triceps and quadriceps being swallowed up slowly but surely as the man&#39;s abdomen began to push out. He made sure the fat distribution was going everywhere, but especially to that gut. It ballooned outward, taking on shape, not unlike Edwin&#39;s, but perhaps more firm, rounded. And it kept swelling out and out and out. Edwin idly wondered if it was 65&quot; around... it looked like it could be. It might even be bigger! The resulting build looked huge and sturdy... but very, very well-fed. It was clear a man like this had perhaps played some ball in college or wrestled, and then in adulthood allowed his athletic gifts to fade away as he tucked into his food, bloating up his middle until it formed a hefty shelf of blubber in front of him! Edwin licked his lips in anticipation.<br />
<br />
He scrolled down to the Age option and thought about it for a moment. Should he be the older one in the relationship? He could see the advantage for that, but the old man in him was already typing into the text box. &quot;70.&quot; His eyes went wide as he read that and watched as the preview model changed to simulate what he&#39;d be getting. The bulk on the man started sagging some more, his belly not quite defying gravity as it once did, although it still kept its round, ball-like shape. Lines appeared on the face, crow&#39;s feet around the eyes, liver spots on the back of the hands. This was going to be an old man, all right.<br />
<br />
All that was left were the little details. Sexual orientation? Edwin surprised himself by putting the man as &quot;Bisexual (male preference).&quot; He thought for sure he&#39;d want him to just be gay, but when he thought about it some more, the thought that this man that would be his partner had potentially been with a woman, had potentially fathered a child with his powerful seed... it made him leak some precum out into his undies, much to his embarrassment. Sexual Position? Edwin surprised himself again by putting &quot;Bottom.&quot; Something about this big man who would tower over him not being the one doing the penetrating tickled him. Penis Length? Edwin surprised himself again. His teenage self had always heard bigger was better, but this older horndog Edwin was gravitating toward this man having a small cock that would easily get lost in his thick bush and the fat pad at his crotch. Hell, he might even need to sit down to go to the bathroom if he had enough trouble reaching the little thing! <br />
<br />
He saw that he had some free text boxes to suggest this man&#39;s history and personality and he decided to let Old Edwin create his perfect dream man. They had met in college, both majoring in Literature. There had been sparks, but both men had been too buttoned-down, too inhibited to act on their mutual feelings of attraction and so allowed themselves to get in relationships with women, both of them marrying young and starting families. Edwin had become a modestly successful author while his dream man stayed in academia as a professor at the local university. They remained close friends until Edwin&#39;s boy graduated college and Edwin could hide his identity no longer. He came out of the closet and divorced his wife, which was difficult at first but they&#39;d managed to remain friends after, much to his relief. His dream man&#39;s wife, however, had died young and left him with five strapping sons to raise on his own. Edwin helped out as much as he could, of course, and once Edwin was out of his marriage both men finally found the courage to admit their feelings for each other. They moved in together six months later and married as soon as the Supreme Court allowed it. His dream man still had tenure at the university while Edwin lived off of his royalties from his several successful books over the years and volunteered part-time at the local library as a librarian. It was a loving, comfortable, sedentary lifestyle they shared, which had ballooned his husband up over the years, not that he minded.<br />
<br />
Edwin looked over his handiwork with a proud smile underneath his beard. He scrolled back up to the Name field and decided upon a name that he felt suited this Nordic dreamboat: Lars Hansen. He made sure that the option to shift reality along with the new subject (he didn&#39;t want to explain to his family where his new husband came from) and went down to the button that said Create Subject and firmly clicked it.<br />
<br />
What Edwin hadn&#39;t counted on was that making sure reality shifted along with the changes of adding this new person to the world meant that his reality would shift along with it, as well, since he&#39;d neglected to opt-out of the reality shift himself. (If only he&#39;d explored the advanced options more carefully!) With a blink and a whoosh, he still found himself sitting in his roller chair in front of the computer, but heard some breathing coming from behind him. He turned his chair around to see a huge man standing before him. Sitting as he was, the man&#39;s stomach took up most of his vision, a vast globe of gluttonous glory, visibly stretching the weave of the navy-teal-salmon argyle sweater-vest that appeared to not-quite make it down to the hem of this man&#39;s gray pinstriped slacks, allowing the matching salmon dress shirt and dark suspenders underneath to be visible. Edwin looked up and saw thick arms shoved into the salmon-colored sleeves of the shirt, thick and strong but also girded by fat over the years, making them as cuddly as they were strong. The man&#39;s shoulders were very broad and his chest was the definition of a barrel, wide and rounded and sturdy, two flabby pecs sitting on top of his rounded majesty. <br />
<br />
Above that, Edwin had trouble seeing due to the man&#39;s height and his short perspective, so he lifted himself, grunting a bit as he felt his knees ache, looking up to see... Lars&#39; handsome face. Sure, others may not have called Lars a looker, but Edwin loved the man&#39;s kind, ice-blue Nordic eyes, he loved the fringe of white hair around his bald head, he loved that big, patrician-looking nose of his, and he loved, loved, loved the huge, bushy mustache and beard he maintained, the whiskers flooding out long enough to partially obscure the man&#39;s bowtie, his mouth completely obscured by the abundance of facial hair. A pair of horn-rimmed glasses sat on the bridge of his nose and the man peered down at Edwin from behind them. Edwin had been right. The top of his head didn&#39;t even reach this behemoth&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
The hulk&#39;s eyes softened as he appeared to recognize the man before him. &quot;Ah, Edwin, there you are. It&#39;s almost dinner,&quot; he spoke, his voice like gentle thunder, his tone as refined and dignified as everything else about the two men. There was clear intelligence and wit to his eyes as they twinkled. &quot;Shall we go down together?&quot; he asked, offering his arm to his husband of 20 years.</p>
