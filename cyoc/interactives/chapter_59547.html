<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The class emptied and Mr V&ouml;ndersh&ouml;n was glad that class was over finally and he could get some lunch. As he wiped the write-on, wipe-off board with the required eraser, he glanced around the classroom, making sure none of the students forgot anything. When his eyes fell on the desk that the nine year olde childe prodigy sat at, he set down the eraser and moving around his desk, he walked up the aisle to Saphira's desk and picking up the note, he silently cursed at the younger generation's incessant need to gossip.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Mr V&ouml;ndersh&ouml;n considered opening the note and seeing what was so important to a nine year old girl, taking her final year in juniour high. Then he sighed, figured it really was not his business and turning, he strolled back up the aisle and threw the note in the waste bin.<br />
<br />
Shortly after he left for lunch, the janitor came in to tidy up. Collecting the bin with the waste, he paused and his nature to know all the secrets of the students got the better of him and plucking the note out of the waste bin, he pocketed it in his jump-suit and set about to tidying up the room...all the time wondering what sort of sordid details lie within the bit of folded paper he had retrieved from the fate that awaited it out back.<br />
<br />
But he forgot about the note eventually and when he reached his office, he emptied his pockets without a second thought, sat about and whiled the hours away until he other duties to attend.<br />
<br />
In search of treasure, and doing so on a dare, a hesitant student entred shortly after the janitor had left and quickly searching the office, he grabbed the note and a couple other things off the desk. When he showed his treasure to his friend's hours later, the note was tossed aside as nothing important and after a moment, a breeze caught it and bore it to new locations.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the realtor office, Mark was silently glad that the day was done, but disappointed that he now had to go home to his wife. As he stood outside his office, staring at the digital clock over the bank, which read five eleven, Mark contemplated two actions: One going to a bar and drinking his troubles away: and two, just getting in his car and driving away from it all. Heading for parts unknown, where he was sure that he could start over. &quot;No job I despise. No wife that leaves me feeling unsatisfied. No people crying out for one thing or another,&quot; he thought as he ran a hand through his short, auburn hair and looked down.<br />
<br />
A breeze distracted him as a piece of paper hit his neatly shined shoes and sighing in disgust at people's need to throw their trash on the ground rather than in a proper bin, he reached down and picking up the note, he began to cast about for a waste bin.<br />
<br />
When he spied one, he marched over and was about to throw the note away when a voice called out, &quot;See you tomorrow, Mark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning, Mark acknowledged the only woman who worked at the realtor office and was about to turn and throw the bit of paper away, when Mary asked, &quot;What you got there, Mark?&quot; and then began to walk closer to him.<br />
<br />
Knowing that the woman was a bit of busy-body, had a slight crush on him, and was a majour ditz to boot, Mark shrugged and replied, &quot;Just a bit of paper somebody tossed on the ground. I was just about to throw it away. You know...Do my part for the environment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary nodded and before Mark could register what she was doing, she took the note from him, with the comment, &quot;Let me see. It could be something important.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not wanting her to see, but resigned to the fact that she'll get her way in the long run, Mark let go of the note and after a moment, he explained, &quot;I really need to get going. Barbara will be expecting me and tonight she is making steak and potatoes for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary nodded, not paying a bit of attention as she unfolded the note and reading the contents within, she handed it back and unceremoniously announced, &quot;Sounds like somebody’s idea of joke. Well, goodnight, Mark. Tell Barbara I said hi,&quot; and turning, she began to march back the way she came, leaving Mark still holding the note, his feelings of despising certain people growing as he thought, &quot;What a berk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down at the note, he thought about throwing it away, but instead read the writing. After rereading it a couple times, he thought that Mary was right about this and that what was written was somebody’s idea of joke.<br />
<br />
Thinking about throwing it away, he thought, &quot;I need something like this,&quot; as he folded the note back up and headed for his car.<br />
<br />
Inside his car, he sat behind the wheel, holding his keys in one hand and the note in another, thinking about what was written on the slip of paper and whether it was somebody’s idea of a joke or if this note could actually grant wishes. After a moment, he stuck the proper key in the ignition, but did not engage it.<br />
<br />
Instead, he withdrew a pen from his pocket and unfolding the note, he reread again. After a moment's thought, he clicked the pen and wrote:<br />
<br />
'My life is a bore. I need change. Something exciting to happen. Something that could change me and the bleak outlook I have on life. I wish that there could come about a change...to me, my mind and my world. Nobody would be the wiser as only I am aware of the change. Though my wife would be alone for the change...supporting me and helping me through whatever tough spots come up. This is my wish: change for me, my mind and my world.'<br />
<br />
And folding up the note, chuckling at what he just wrote and that he actually could believe such things could happen just because he wrote it on a note, he started up his car and began to drive home. Hours later, his wife would find the note and make her own wish.</p>
