<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You got your sister pregnant!&quot; I screamed at Jamie, thrusting him into a dining room chair. I'd wished Mom and Dad had to go to some event, and my brother and I had the house to ourselves for the evening. &quot;Your sister! How will we explain that to the world?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do we have to explain anything, Joelle?&quot; Jamie said, struggling to keep his composure. &quot;As long as we don't tell anybody who the father is, nobody has to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;People are going to ask. And people are going to notice that we haven't dated, and we've scarcely left the house except to go to school. I'm surprised people don't already think we're having an incestuous affair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom and Dad haven't noticed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I wished them not to notice!&quot; I screamed, pulling my fingers through my long, feminine hair. &quot;I didn't even think to wish it for anybody else until just now! For all I know, people already know!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody knows anything,&quot; Jamie said in a soothing voice. &quot;I haven't told anybody, and you haven't told anybody, and we've kept out cool at school.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So they don't know. But I know they suspect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They only suspect because they're jealous, Joelle. All the girls want to be you and fuck me, and all the boys want to be me and fuck you. And I can't blame them. Not only are you hot, you're learning to be an excellent lover.&quot; He reached out a hand and stroked my belly. My tight teenage figure wasn't showing the pregnancy yet, but I'd already told my brother that his baby was growing inside my body.<br />
<br />
I slapped his hand away. &quot;Don't try to get affectionate now, mister,&quot; I said. &quot;That's how we got in this position in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jamie said, waving a finger at me. &quot;We got in this position by having sex two to four times every night for a month.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About that,&quot; I said, stomping across the dining room. &quot;I should report you for rape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rape?&quot; Jamie suddenly sounded like he was trying not to laugh. &quot;You've wanted it every time I've asked to fuck. You've moaned, and you've kissed me, and you've come so hard I'm surprised you haven't broken your spine. You even said you loved me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I couldn't control the feelings after we swapped bodies,&quot; I protested. &quot;Your girly feelings are so intense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your boyish horniness is unstoppable. We've fucked every night for a month, and I'm not tired of your body yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean your body,&quot; I said. &quot;We as good as swapped, and you've been using my dick to fuck your own pussy every night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you've loved it. Don't try to blame me because you got in trouble from all the endless fucking, sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't call me sister, Jamie. That's sick. And we're both in trouble now, if you haven't noticed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie rose from his chair and crossed the dining room to me, cupping my cheeks in his hands. &quot;I have noticed,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm sorry for shouting at you. You're my sister, and I love you, and I'll do anything to keep us together.&quot; He leaned in and kissed my lips.<br />
<br />
I resisted for a moment, then gave in to my passions, pressing my breasts into his chest. Our bodies felt so right together. We fit together like two halves of a puzzle. His body made mine feel complete.<br />
<br />
Jamie led me around to the dining room table. He lifted me up and set me on the surface where our family had dinner every night, then gently leaned me back. He hopped up on top of me, slowly unbuttoning my lace blouse. &quot;I love you,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to be yours forever. I want to be the father of our baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
We undressed each other and made love on the dining room table. Our heads lay right where our daddy's dinner plate had sat an hour ago. We had learned how to please each other completely. Jamie moved inside my body, and we sucked and bit at each other, tracing the shapes of each other's bodies, until he filled me with more of his thick, potent semen.<br />
<br />
At least he couldn't make me any more pregnant.<br />
<br />
After we made love, Jamie lay atop me, still inside my body. I looked up at him. &quot;So what are we going to do about this baby?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do any brother and sister couple do,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose we could lie about who the father is. But neither of us has dated in the right time frame for the conception, so people will at least suspect. Or we could run away to someplace where nobody knows our faces, and live like husband and wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like that,&quot; Jamie said. &quot;Not to have to hide my love and affection for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But people will notice we look similar enough to be brother and sister,&quot; I said. &quot;And besides, we're still kids. We don't know how to take care of ourselves, much less a baby, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true. But you have a magic ring, Joelle. Maybe you can wish for us to have the knowledge, and for us to go unnoticed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We rely too much on the magic ring, Jamie. We should learn to solve our own problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But this isn't just like late homework. A baby is a serious commitment. I think we'd be justified to use the ring in this case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could use the ring to wish us back into our own bodies,&quot; I said. &quot;Then you could have this baby, and it wouldn't be my problem anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would if you don't start taking this baby seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn't really make me go back to being a frustrated lesbian, would you? Only now I'd be pregnant too? If that happened, I'd really tell everyone you were the father, and let the chips fall where they may.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could wish that you were unable to tell. I could wish that you didn't even remember who the father is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But if I forgot that, I'd forget our affair. You'll still want my body, even if we switch back, and if I forget, I'll go back to being off limits again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm only making suggestions,&quot; I said. &quot;Don't get ahead of yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me make a suggestion, then,&quot; Jamie said. &quot;You could wish to make us old enough to take care of ourselves. Nobody would think it was weird for young adult twins to share an apartment, and we could make up any explanation we wanted for the baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I wanted to make us older, I could also wish for us to be married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could wish that sibling marriage was okay under certain circumstances. Or I could wish nobody but us remembered we were brother and sister. Or I could even wish that Mom and Dad gave their consent to our relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know how I feel about that,&quot; Jamie said. &quot;As much as I love you, Joelle, the taboo makes the sex even hotter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to agree. But we have to plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could...&quot; Jamie ducked his head, trying to avoid my gaze. &quot;You could just wish the baby away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean like an abortion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Half of all babies spontaneously abort anyway. Or you could wish to transplant the baby into another couple who was struggling to have a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or I could transplant it into Mom's womb, and we'd have a new brother or sister, instead of a son or daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could be a baby factory,&quot; Jamie said, &quot;and nobody would ever know, because every fetus could go to another struggling family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Jamie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Joelle.&quot;<br />
<br />
I kissed my brother softly on the lips, and stroked his unshaven teenage cheek. He started to get hard inside me again. I bit him on the collarbone, and he sucked on my ear, and in a moment, we were ready to go again.<br />
<br />
Some nights we made slow, sweet love. Other nights we fucked like bunnies in heat. He'd had his dick in my pussy and my mouth, though I'd made it plain my ass was off limits. We'd done it in the missionary position, and I'd ridden him like a pony, and he'd mounted me doggystyle. I just never got tired of my brother's body.<br />
<br />
When we were tired and spent again, lying side by side on the dining room table, I leaned over and whispered into the cup of his ear: &quot;We have to make a decision.&quot;</p>
