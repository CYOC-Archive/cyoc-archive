<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Some of the quality time sessions between Tyra and Heather did come out to help heal their relationship. While Tyra had no intention of embracing her renewed youth and wasn&#39;t going to turn down Rex&#39;s attention, there was the growing sense as Heather and Jeremy continued to bond and move forward with their engagement, that Heather really enjoyed her time with him. In that from time to time, both had noticed mutual pleasure filled roars/bellows as they enjoyed their mates. However, as they talked and engaged in real bonding between them, Heather&#39;s unease with a lot of Tyra&#39;s actions began to lessen and Tyra felt her relationship with Heather begin to regain some strength. <br />
<br />
Yes, Tyra was still Heather&#39;s grandmother and loved her as such, but their now physical age being so close was such that they could engage in a way that would be closer to sisters or good friends as well. And that really helped both of them, and this soon included how they got along would do things. And on one Friday evening they settled down in the cabin that Tyra and Heather had been given while Heather was on parole/probation, they settled down to watch some television with Rex and Jeremy present as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure on why they&#39;re deciding to do this as a television series,&quot; Rex answered, &quot;Even with the reports that Jack and Mary Piper have essentially admitted to their actions... wouldn&#39;t making a sitcom/television series with it only reward the behavior?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the idea that was put together was that a lot of the profit from the series will go to charity,&quot; Jeremy said slowly, &quot;and could likely provide help for others that have been victimized the way Mary Piper was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And so long as they don&#39;t defend what Mary Piper did in this show, there&#39;d be no problem,&quot; Heather added.<br />
<br />
And from there their eyes focused to the television as the primer of &quot;Cheaper by the Dozens&quot; came on, and starting with a wide angle shot of the apartment complex that the Piper clan was settled in after being fully uplifted. And unlike the web series that Susan and Tzan ran on Mieni, the series would be able to show all the Piper Clan at once, as it was being recorded professionally for television, rather than as a webcast for Animalia&#39;s website the way &quot;The Animalian Odd Couple&quot; was. In a way, it made for a more professional production that Jeremy found to be rather good.<br />
<br />
It did include a fair amount of humor with some jokes here and there, mostly based on the chaos that resulted from trying to keep track of just how big the Piper Clan was. As Piper had had around fifty children during her time in the sewers, many by Jack and a few by her own children as they seemed to share much of the same feral state that Jack did.  Some of her children had even bred with each other, according to what Jeremy remembered. Jeremy remembered that the children were smarter than Jack before completing the uplifting process brought the entire Piper clan on par with other Animalians. It also healed those that had been born through incestuous relationships of any and all birth defects that had resulted from that. However, the massive number was still something that could create chaos that made for good humor.<br />
<br />
Jeremy found himself enjoying it, and was even surprised to see that Heather was also heavily enjoying the show. He knew that Heather could be possessive of him at times and seemed to be the most distraught at his kidnapping the previous Halloween. In this, he wasn&#39;t sure that Heather would take to &quot;Cheaper by the Dozens&quot; very well. But after her talk with Sabine, Heather had come to some realization that she couldn&#39;t just treat Mary Piper with complete contempt and expect forgiveness in her own right. The more she thought on it, the more it made sense, as Mary Piper had kidnapped Jeremy in desperation for a cure for her condition. She had threatened to kill and eat Sophie and Roland out of petty revenge for their participation in foiling her schemes in Costa Rica. She didn&#39;t have the room to complain with regard to Mary Piper, as both of them were essentially in the same boat, one way or another.<br />
<br />
Though, while there was a fair amount of comedy, there was a section toward the end of the episode that was far more serious. It was a scene that was in the evening and gathered around the dinner table. While there was some cheese on everyone&#39;s plate, most of what was there were nuts, meats, and various &quot;harder&quot; foods, which made sense given that the Norway/Brown Rat, like all rodents, had its incisors growing continuously. They never stopped growing and thus they needed to primarily feed on things that were harder so that the teeth wouldn&#39;t grow through their heads. However, dinner was not the subject that came up.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... when could I move in?&quot; Jack asked to Mary Piper on the screen drawing a few heads to turn and playing to the fact that the two were in separate rooms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not really looking to that,&quot; Mary Piper answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot; Jack blinked and looked to her, &quot;Mary... I know what I did was awful... and if I were truly uplifted then, I would have told you you were beautiful and asked you out and wouldn&#39;t have done what I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s commendable, Jack,&quot; Mary Piper replied, &quot;and perhaps if things went that way... I might think on it... but it didn&#39;t. You raped me and that is not something that just goes away or is forgiven to the point where I would want a romantic relationship with the one who raped me.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few startled gasps from the other members of the Piper clan as they all heard that statement. For the moment though, no one said anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you know I&#39;m sorry for that, Mary,&quot; Jack said slowly, &quot;I can&#39;t keep track of how often I&#39;ve said it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And in a way I can understand that and I do forgive you on the basis that you weren&#39;t fully uplifted and were essentially still thinking like a more mundane rat,&quot; Mary Piper replied, &quot;and in that... I can be open to being friends... Platonic friends. But... I STILL want to be human again and even if I wanted to be an Animalian... a Brown Rat is not my choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
That earned MORE gasps from the rest of the gathered clan as they sat around a large round table in a truly massive dining room. Even Jack was a bit surprised by that.  The clan&#39;s children that Mary Piper had born had essentially been born as Brown Rats and thus their only possible choice for them was between being Animalians or mundane Animals.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t love us?&quot; one of the younger children asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you as a parent,&quot; Mary answered, &quot;You aren&#39;t responsible for what happened to me... but that doesn&#39;t change that I&#39;d prefer to be human again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;re all Animalians... Brown Rats,&quot; another of the Piper children spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Mary Piper said in an assuring voice, &quot;There are many parents out there that have no relation to their children. It&#39;s the result of something called adoption. Children without parents... or parents who are judged to be unable to care for their children... are adopted by people who can care for them and do want to care for them. And those relationships can be just as loving as families where the children are born into the family...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a silence for a moment before Mary Piper continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as I said, I don&#39;t blame you for what happened and I do care for you,&quot; Mary Piper continued, &quot;you ALL deserve the best that I can provide, and all the parental love and care I can give... But I don&#39;t need to be a Brown Rat Animalian to care for you. In that... if Horizon does find a way to restore my Humanity... I&#39;d take it. But that won&#39;t change that I will love and care for you. What we look like shouldn&#39;t matter in that regard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you do love us?&quot; one of the older children sitting next to Mary Piper.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a parent... yes,&quot; Mary Piper answered, &quot;and never doubt that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; the older child then spoke, showing some signs of relief.<br />
<br />
The scene ended with some conclusion and assurance that the clan would probably stay together for the foreseeable future. It&#39;d be at least until the children that Mary Piper had that had already reached adulthood had their probation period&#39;s end and thus could move out of the apartment/home complex that they&#39;d been put in and that Mary Piper would remain as a mother figure to the younger children. How long all of that would last was up in the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn&#39;t want to be an Animalian?&quot; Tyra asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Restoring her humanity was her reason for kidnapping me,&quot; Jeremy answered, &quot;as by that time... I&#39;d started to realize that Polly was happy and didn&#39;t WANT to go back to being human and was having the realization that Heather was interested as more than a friend and... as such would mean becoming Syntixisaurus Rex to be with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She accepted the dose for the more complete Animalia Virus, though,&quot; Heather commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was more a concession to try and heal the mental degradation that had happened as a result of her transformation in the sewers,&quot; Jeremy answered, &quot;and in pure theory could still have room to restore her humanity. We did some tissue tests on her in the sense of introducing the Animalia Virus again... and in those tests, her cells DID respond in the way that would be indicative of &quot;double dosing,&quot; which could provide the theoretical option for reversing her initial transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s not double dosed?&quot; Rex gasped with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s our theory,&quot; Jeremy nodded, &quot;though... while that theoretically could enable reversing her transformation into an Animalian... we aren&#39;t quite at a point where we&#39;d be willing to test some counter serum on a live subject as we&#39;re still cataloguing precisely how the Animalia Virus works and thus how it could be reversed... And that would take awhile, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about a Human strain of the Animalia Virus,&quot; Tyra wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That might reduce some of her rat features, but it wouldn&#39;t reverse them completely,&quot; Jeremy spoke, &quot;and would also have certain concerns on what would happen to the anatomical features that rats have that Humans do not. As it stands, we could make her more human but couldn&#39;t restore her humanity continually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still a surprise that she&#39;d want that,&quot; Tyra commented, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to go back... being a dinosaur is a bit different... and on my own I might have chosen a bird species, but as I am now... I wouldn&#39;t go back, even if I could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy Tyra,&quot; Heather made a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... birds are dinosaurs,&quot; Rex cut in, showing his position as a paleontologist on the connection between dinosaurs and birds.<br />
<br />
&quot;But not as big as us,&quot; Tyra laughed and kissed Rex&#39;s cheek.</p>
