<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You know, I think they don´t deserve individual bodies. That, and there is only space for one being beneath the minotaur. So, let´s get to work with that” George said with a grin.<br />
Suddenly, Mike and Sei moved, or better yet, their bodies did, with Mike climbing onto Sei´s back. For a few seconds, nothing else happened, as Mike´s arms positioned alongside Sei´s, his hands on top of the others. His legs and feet were the same.<br />
With a shudder, both bodies pressed into each other, and it didn´t stop at any physical border, they just pushed into each other. Within half a minute, what stood in the space of the two was one body with more muscular arms and legs, bigger hands and feet, and two heads, the only thing not merged together beside their cocks. Sei was the left head, while Mike was the right one, with only an inch of air between their ears left.<br />
George grinned at the now cojoined boys before him. “There, you insulted the little boy for his body being smaller and weaker, now you have a freaky body shared between you. But don´t worry, you aren´t finished yet.” <br />
With the grin turning evil, George walked over and pushed their heads down until they could see their cocks beneath them. The pushing ignored any physical restriction, as a normal human or animal would have its neck snapped at that point. Mentally widening their eyes in horror, both boys could only watch as their proud cocks were pressed into each other by George, and squeezed smaller in width. Afterwards, under some laugher, he pushed it in, further decimating their once proud tool until it was half what either boy had before, a short little thing.<br />
“There, more fitting for you, don´t you think? Now, for the second part.” After raising their heads again, a simple gesture let the puddle of stone beneath them, left from the vomit of stone liquid Johnny had done, to raise onto their body. <br />
Starting at both their hands and feet, the liquid reformed them easily. Fingers shortened while the nails got a bit longer, thumbs being pushed back while shrinking and light pads forming onto their palms. Their toes did the same as their feet got reformed, leaving them with four paws in place.<br />
Their arms and legs equalized in length, making walking on all fours easier. They also reformed into fore-legs and hind-legs, which would stop them from getting up again. When the liquid reached their now little cock, it enveloped it as it pressed to their groin, soon revealing a dog-like sheath in its place, no cock being seen outside. Anything lost of their cocks before had instead emerged behind them on their ass, soon resembling a short tail.<br />
As the liquid moved up and down their body, soon meeting in the middle, their body reformed into an agiler shape, and they could be sure if there was still a spine in them, it had cracked to the point they would remain on all fours as well.<br />
Both Mike and Sei thought they would drown with the amount of liquid around their heads, like the others did as well. The liquid readjusted their necks, forcing them to look forward, while it consumed their features. Ears up to the top and bigger, eyes wider and a muzzle covering their nose and mouth left them a pure dog figure, just bigger and with two heads, making them a two-headed Cerberus. Their faces had no difference, making them indistinguishable from each other.<br />
But the liquid wasn´t finished with them. It enveloped their whole body again, only to press them a bit smaller again, still bigger than a normal dog, but not by much. The liquid then left their body and sprung back at Eric, and forced him to grew a bit bigger from the two´s loss. In the end, he was still a bit shorter than Johnny as the gargoyle, his eyes around the high of the gargoyles chin. <br />
“There, all done with you, a bad Cerberus-pet for the bull. But as his pet, you belong by his hooves, so move over there and protect your master, mutt. And look fitting to your being. What is it with all of you looking so embarrassing and fearful? You are monsters, you need to look dangerous.” George said with an angry huff. He couldn´t understand how someone could look so pathetic.<br />
Mike and Sei could do nothing as their merged Cerberus body moved, jumping onto the minotaur’s pedestal before turning to look at the gargoyles, a snarl on the former Mike´s face, while Sei´s let out a silent howl to frighten trespassers. A bit of stone emerged around their necks, forming a spike-collar for each of them.<br />
“Finally done with the intruders. Maybe I´m allowed to leave now.” George said, and when nothing seemed to answer, he smiled. “Have fun guarding this place forever, beasts.” With that said, he left them standing there.<br />
Johnny, while still a spark of satisfaction remained for Sei and Mike being punished, feared he now had doomed them all. If he hadn´t insulted that gargoyle, he wouldn´t have switched with him and then captured the others. He could do nothing but hope that he could somehow control stone like the gargoyle did, to free them someday. Hopefully, before they had lost their old selves.<br />
Ryan couldn´t believe what had become of them all, monster statues in some garden, with him the puniest of the group. He cried mentally as his hope was already lost. Nobody else knew they had been here, and even if, they were all unrecognizable now.<br />
Eric stood there above his friends, equally hopeless as Ryan of rescue. What could they do? Unmovable, horrifying monsters made of stone, nothing left from their old looks. Nobody would find them, and somehow, if anyone came here, he was thinking they would sooner join them then being their rescue.<br />
Mike and Sei both got a picture of themselves in their minds as they stood there, a pathetic, small Cerberus beneath the minotaur that was once Eric, reduced to be his pet. Eye-level just above the tiny gargoyle-kid that had been Ryan, their leader. Even if they were insulting his little brother, what had Ryan done to earn this fate? And how could they ever free themselves? Would the two of them remain merged like this forever? At least their minds weren´t merged.<br />
And with George leaving, the garden fell silent again, awaiting new victims.</p>
