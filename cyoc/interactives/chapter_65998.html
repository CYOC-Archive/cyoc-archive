<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan stood in awe of drake.at first ethan couldn't speak...but he somehow managed words. &quot;fucking  hell , <br />
drake!&quot;, <br />
how did you do this?!&quot;Drake then told the tale of the lamp and how it came into his posession,about how we had <br />
wished for his muscles to grow and grow until it shredded his clothes.Ethan , (though still somewhat in <br />
shock)was curious and wanted to see the lamp.drake went over to the closet he had blocked off.every muscle <br />
flexed and pulsedwhen he moved.ethan was getting very turned on by drakes huge ripped mass.&quot;god&quot;, he thought <br />
,&quot;he must must of improved his looks too, he was so chiseled now...perfect&quot;.Drake easily moved the &quot;so called&quot;  <br />
heavy object he had placed in front of the closet. drake retrieved to lamp and returned to ethan, again every <br />
rock hard inch of him bouncing and heaving  just from walking. drake showed ethan the lamp.&quot;wow&quot;, ethan <br />
said,&quot;its not what i expected. it just looks like a dirty old piece of junk.&quot;drake laughed (his voice was so <br />
deep now) &quot;yeah your right, it does but its a lot more than junk and it really works. say, ethan you once told <br />
me you wanted bigger muscles, right?&quot;drake began to rub the lamp to summon beldazzar. &quot;drake! what are you <br />
doing?!&quot;ethan yelled, and trying to swat the lamp from drakes hands. drake reached over and picked his tiny , <br />
nervous friend up by the collar and suspended him. ethan, struggling, tring to free himself from drakes grip <br />
looked in awe as he saw smoke coming from the lamp. &quot;greetings master&quot;, beldazzar said as he appeared,&quot; ah, <br />
you have a friend with you...very well, what is your wish?&quot; drake thought for a brief second, then <br />
spoke,&quot;beldazzar,  i wish for my friend ethan here to grow into a huge super hung bodybuilder like i did.but i <br />
want him bigger...make him a hulking muscle giant!...make ethan grow until he has twice the muscle mass as i <br />
do.&quot; beldazzar nodded and was gone. &quot;drake!...what have you done?!...that big!..i.cant...i&quot;. ethan froze, he <br />
looked at his forearm and saw is skin moving pulling tighter and darkening...veins began to pop..then the <br />
tingling...it was happening.drake carried him into the tv room (it had cathedral ceilings with a <br />
loft.....ethan was going to need them) drake set him down and stepped back to give his &quot; soon to be&quot; muscle <br />
freak some room.ethan began to cry scared but could not yell or move he was frozen in his place.it wouldn't <br />
help now...the muscle was coming.ethan felt his polo shirt and khaki  jeans getting tighter. he felt his flat <br />
chest swelling up. his sleeves began to crawl up his arms. he got taller...wider and taller and wider. he felt <br />
his pecs rise pulling the buttons apart. ethan was a little guy at 132 lbs and 5'6&quot; but now he had grown to <br />
175lbs and 5'9&quot;.more and more muscle  swelled on ethan. his shirt grew tight, pullig up revealing a a 6 pack. <br />
he began to like the transformation , it felt awesome. all this new muscle mass straining against his clothes. <br />
it wasn't just his muscles, as he saw when he look down at the  hardon he had for drake. it had grown to from <br />
a solid 6 inches(about average) to a fat 9 inch cock with a huge head. he watch it lengthen and get fatter and <br />
fatter in his pants. then sensation of it rubbing the fabric as it grew felt amazing.his thighs bulged with <br />
striations right through the jeans that were getting uncomfortably tight.ethan was pretty big now. 6 feet and <br />
220 lbs of succulent muscle ripped and tan like a real bodybuilder.he began to hear threads and seems popping. <br />
ethans fear had  was long gone now and he began flex and tense his huge frame. the loud rips of then seems got <br />
longer and louder as the tears revealed more bulging mass. his glutes,  perfectly huge and round  tore the <br />
seem right up the back of his pants at the same time as his upper  glutes( developed right to hid striated <br />
thick lower back) pushed up and pulled his waistban down.suddenly ethan's ,now 12 inch cock, popped one by one <br />
his button fly open. ethans pants finally lost the battle  and began to tear apart.ethan grunted loudly with <br />
the release as he saw his huge thigh mass balloon forth and ripped the remainder of the jeans to the floor. at <br />
the same time his growing feet split his shoes to pieces.<br />
&quot;almost there&quot;, ethan chuckled.&quot;not nearly&quot;, drake thought remembering his wish for ethan to be twice the <br />
muscular giant he was. ethans shirt ,like the pants began to pull apart as his back pecs and delts blew up <br />
huger and huger each passing second. ethan pulled his arms up and quickly hit a double biceps, pulling the <br />
shirt in two. the sleeves of the shirt hung from ethans 20 inch guns, but only for a moment as his arms pumped <br />
up to 22 1/2 inches an involuntary flex tore them  the rest of the way.there stood a 250lbs ethan, in a pair  <br />
black nylon boxer briefs and black socks at 6'2.ethans heart began to pound, perhaps with less clothing to <br />
constrict the growth , the transformation kicked it up a bit. suddenly the muscle came a bit faster. 275lbs <br />
6'4 ,he was a super heavy weight with a 13 inch long and 6 inch  thick cock and huge balls that filled  and <br />
tested his briefs each moment. 315 lbs  and ethans pecs  swelled and ripped and slammed in to his melon sized <br />
biceps which in turn seemed to fight for room with his thick twisted forearms, just for a bit as his frame <br />
adusted to support his new mass. ethan felt a jolt, a jolt of growth. his quads expand several inches in a few <br />
seconds, along with  his glutes. his nylon briefs were so taught they looked shear. ethan felt his monster <br />
traps push up to his ears. his neck responded thickening into his traps then lengthening. his body ran torrent <br />
with sweat.pounds and pounds of muscle piled on even faster. drake could hear ethans flesh growing like a <br />
crackling of dry rubber stretching. 425 lbs became 530 then 700lbs ethan socks  split and peeled off ,even <br />
etans feet were muscualar and veiny. his underwear peeled apart his glutes bounce forth and us cock a dropped <br />
past his knees, fell against is massive quads and continued to grow  18 inches.ethan rose higher and higher <br />
his stance grew wider and wider. 1100 lbs ripped overdeveloped mass. &quot;drake!!...oh god!&quot; ethan cried out as e <br />
continued to grow and rip. 1575. he felt the floor boards creak under his mass. 12 feet tall e towered over <br />
drake. drake looked up, licking his lips and possibly planning more for out &quot;little&quot; ethan. 1750 lbs and then <br />
1920lbs of freakish beef. ethans growth came to and  slow then stop. he was definelty more than twice drakes <br />
mass  at a metric ton of muscle and at 15 feet tall. his cock was of two feet  and thick as hell. ethan stood <br />
there panting....heaving. every muscle built beyond reality at a vascular 1% bodyfat.</p>
