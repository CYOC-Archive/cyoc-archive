<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Courtney strolled down the aisle, swinging her hips and placing one foot deliriously in front of the other.  She was so bored! Her little brother had begged and begged to stop at this stupid hobby store on their way home, and Courtney had finally given in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five minutes!&quot; She had said sharply as the blonde hair of her ten year old sibling darted off excitedly down an aisle.  She checked her watch.  She&#39;d been absentmindedly strolling the perimeter of the store for a little over ten minutes.  She was hoping to run into her brother, grab him by the arm, and leave.  It was Friday afternoon, and her friends were coming over to help &quot;babysit&quot; her brother while her parents stayed out late to attend a fundraiser.  She wanted to get home and freshen up before her friends arrived.<br />
<br />
At a little over five and a half feet, Courtney was a junior in high school.  Her toned legs were on display, as she wore a pair of short teal athletic shorts.  Volleyball in the fall and now soccer in the winter kept her in great shape, and her fitted t-shirt left little of her tight stomach and C-cup breasts to the imagination.  Her arms were crossed over her chest, pushing her breasts together and creating a large canyon of cleavage, the v-neck of her shirt providing the perfect peek.  Her dark brown hair was pulled into a ponytail and fell a few inches below her shoulder blades, giving a full view of her smooth face and almond-colored eyes.<br />
<br />
Those eyes suddenly landed on a bright yellow box, sitting on a shelf at eye level on her left.  &quot;Transformation Station&quot; was the name printed on the side, along with a stylized train.  Her boyfriend had a bit of a nerdy side, and had introduced her to the game &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; last week.  Maybe this game was related?  She slid the box off the shelf and looked at the cover.  It was curiously heavy, and although clearly an older game, looked modern enough to be entertaining.  It had the words &quot;Transformation Station&quot; printed on the top, with the same stylized train making its way across the cover.  Below the train was written &quot;A party game for friends, lovers, and even enemies!&quot;  Those words alone were enough to push Courtney&#39;s curiosity over the edge.<br />
<br />
Five minutes later saw her and her brother getting into the car to leave.  Her brother was clutching a box that looked like a plastic model of a ray gun under his arm, and Courtney had a plastic bag with Transformation Station inside.  &quot;Thought you didn&#39;t like geeky stuff?&quot; Her brother said snottily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; she said, and backed out of the parking space.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;They don&#39;t get back until, what, midnight?&quot; Sara asked, plopping down on the couch next to Caleb and cracking open her soda can.  Sara and Courtney had been friends for only a few months, having met at the beginning of the school year in history class.  Because her mother was Japanese, she had the distinct olive skin, slanted eyes, and jet black hair.  Her curves undoubtedly came from her father&#39;s American heritage, and as she leaned forward on the couch, Caleb&#39;s eyes instinctively flicked to the back of her yoga pants, where he could see the waistband of her thong peeking out.  She had an amazing ass, and loved displaying it with tight clothes, much to the delight of sophomores like Caleb.  Her slightly less impressive B-cup chest was nonetheless on display as she leaned forward, her loose-fitting tank top falling away and exposing, to anyone who was looking, a hot pink Victoria&#39;s Secret push-up bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least,&quot; Courtney replied, not looking at Sara.  She was too busy squeezing Derrick&#39;s muscular shoulders as he sat with his eyes closed, loving the attention from his girlfriend.  Derrick was a junior and on the basketball team.  He had blond hair, buzzed close to his scalp, and Courtney could tell he had been hitting the weight room a lot recently, as she felt his taught muscles beneath his dri-fit workout shirt.  He also wore a pair of baggy athletic shorts, and facing Sara and sitting cross-leged as he was, Sara noticed with an odd feeling in her stomach that she could see a good ways down his shorts, his muscular thighs and a bit of purple underwear - definitely not boxers - showing.  She quickly flicker her eyes away, glad his eyes were closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Niiiiice,&quot; chimed in Jenna, eyes locked on her smartphone as she sat with her legs bunched up in front of her at the opposite end of the couch from Sara and Caleb.  &quot;What are we gonna do?&quot;  Ashley was the &quot;baby&quot; of the group, a sophomore but on the varsity soccer team with Courtney.  Also like Courtney, she had on a pair of short athletic shorts, and with her legs bunched up, they clung tightly to her bottom and crotch, displaying her thick thighs.  She was definitely curvy, and was often quick to label herself chubby, with her thicker body-type, enormous D-cup breasts, and larger rear end.  Her dirty blonde hair hung down around her shoulders, a few strands pooling into the cleavage displayed by her low-cut t-shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you found a new game?&quot; Asked Caleb, readjusting himself on the couch ever so slightly and looking at Courtney.  He had felt a tightness in his crotch after he had glimpsed Sara&#39;s exposed thong.  He had a huge crush on her, and recently she&#39;d been returning the interest.  Heck, she&#39;d invited him over tonight to hang out at Courtney&#39;s, so it had to be a good sign, right?  A bit awkward, Caleb nonetheless was charming, polite, and had a huge package.  The guys on the basketball team teased him in the locker room, all in good fun, but he had suffered a huge social crises last year when &quot;the word&quot; got out to the general school population.  Still, he had survived, and couldn&#39;t help but think that Sara had taken an interest in him since that incident.  He was probably just imagining it, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure did,&quot; said Courtney, standing up from behind Derrick and walking across the living room to get her the game.  Derrick opened his eyes and sighed, then readjusted his posture as well, cutting off Sara&#39;s view down his shorts.  Sara felt a slight feeling of disappointment as he did so.  &quot;Dun dun dun duuuun!&quot; Courtney said with mock fanfare, tossing the game onto the coffee table in front of everyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transformation Station,&quot; Derrick read aloud, &quot;looks... interesting.  How do we play?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No idea,&quot; Courtney said cheerily, sitting next to Caleb on the floor.  She tore off the cellophane wrapping and lifted the lid.  Within a few minutes, they&#39;d set up the board.  It was in the shape of a train, and the different colored player tokens started in the caboose and worked their way to the engine.  Along the way, there were multiple routes through the different cars, with colored squares and directions written on them.  At the center and top of the board was a large plastic bubble, like in the game &quot;Trouble,&quot; but it was inky black with no dice inside as far as anyone could tell.<br />
<br />
After everyone had picked their color token, Courtney read the directions aloud: &quot;Push the button, move along any route for the designated amount of spaces, and follow the directions.  First player to reach the engine car wins, and gets to decide the fate of the other players.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Said Caleb, disappointment obvious in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess so,&quot; said Courtney, suddenly worried it was going to be a dud.  &quot;I mean, if it sucks we can do something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well let&#39;s give it a shot,&quot; said Jenna, clicking off her phone&#39;s screen and sliding it into a cup of her bra.  &quot;Who goes first?&quot;</p>
