<br />
Frances Twist looked up from the Jacuzzi tub she was soaking in and smiled as her wife Samantha entered the bathroom.<br />
The other woman was carrying a metal tea kettle and two plastic glasses.<br />
&quot;Sorry for the delay. Got a text from Ben while I was fixing the tea,&quot; explained Samantha as she closed the door and set everything down on the basin counter.<br />
&quot;Is he all right?&quot; asked Frances, as Samantha poured two glasses of herbal tea.<br />
&quot;Terrific. Spent the entire day with Kenya and is blissfully unaware anything happened around here,&quot; revealed Samantha, as she turned around and handed her wife a cup.<br />
The werecat in the tub looked up at her mate as she accepted the drink. The sleek curves. The soft fur. <i>That mischievous twinkle in her eyes...</i><br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Samantha, noticing her mate staring at her.<br />
&quot;I was just thinking that you&#39;re even more beautiful today than the first time I saw your fursona,&quot; said Frances with a smile.<br />
&quot;I hate to say it, but the only thing that kept going through my mind today was &#39;If I should ever lose you&#39;...&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going to ever lose me. We&#39;re going to grow old and gray together, just like we talked about all those years ago when we first started planning our future together.&quot;<br />
&quot;And that is something I want more than anything else in life. You,&quot; declared Samantha, before she got down on her furry knees and kissed her wife.<br />
The two werecats turned their respective heads until the lips of their muzzles joined together. At first the kiss was gentle and loving, but it didn&#39;t take long for their tongues to dance in each other&#39;s mouths.<br />
When their lips finally parted, Frances looked at Samantha and said, &quot;I believe somebody promised me a massage? The tub jets are fine, but they&#39;re no substitute to your talented paws.&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; said Samantha with a smile, pausing only long enough to refill the glasses with more tea.<br />
<br />
The plastic cups sat on the bathroom floor and the kettle back on the basin counter as Frances scooted forward enough to let her wife slip in behind her.<br />
The werecat sighed and started letting out a low purr as Samantha sat behind her, her breasts brushing against Frances&#39; back as Samantha&#39;s legs came forward and wrapped themselves around her wife&#39;s torso.<br />
Frances leaned back, taking great joy and comfort in the feeling of their bodies pressed together.<br />
Samantha reached forward and started massaging Frances&#39; neck and shoulders, even as she leaned forward and started tenderly kissing whatever part of Frances she could reach that her paws weren&#39;t already touching.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Although he seriously hated parting company with his girlfriend and future fiance and wife Kenya Adaeze, Ben Twist came home for the night. The familiar phrase he had heard for years &quot;Tomorrow&#39;s a school day,&quot; echoed in his memory.<br />
After raiding the fridge for a light snack, Ben walked into the hallway and saw the door to his mothers&#39; bedroom closed.<br />
Recalling Samantha&#39;s text that if it was closed, they would see him in the morning, Ben silently wished them a pleasant good night and then retreated to his own bedroom for the evening.<br />
<br />
BACK IN THE MASTER BATHROOM...<br />
For a while it was just the two of them, lost in their own little paradise.<br />
Samantha had Frances in her arms, who had leaned back to lay her head upon her wife&#39;s shoulder.<br />
The happily married lesbian couple moved their heads to kiss as Samantha continued to massage Frances, and she just laid there in her wife&#39;s loving arms.<br />
Except for their son Ben, there was nothing more important in their lives than each other.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve been through a lot together,&quot; said Frances, as she gently caressed what she could reach of Samantha&#39;s legs. &quot;To this day, I still cannot say exactly what it was, but the moment I first saw you Samantha, I knew you were THE ONE for me, and that there would never be anyone else but you.&quot;<br />
&quot;For me, I&#39;m afraid it wasn&#39;t love at first sight, but love at first touch,&quot; admitted Samantha. &quot;The first time we kissed.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said Frances, looking up at her wife the best she could.<br />
&quot;We hadn&#39;t even known each other, let alone been together, more than a full week yet,&quot; recalled Samantha, as she lovingly wrapped her furry arms around her wife&#39;s feline chest. Frances purred at receiving the hug, especially since Samantha&#39;s arms were brushing up against the underside of her breasts.<br />
&quot;I was already starting to think of you as my girlfriend, although your parents ordering you not to see me any more because I had two mothers certainly didn&#39;t help.&quot;<br />
&quot;True,&quot; agreed Frances, snuggling up against Samantha.<br />
&quot;But the moment we shared our first kiss, even as our lips pressed against each others, I got this flash of the two of us walking down the aisle together as wife and wife on our wedding day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances craned her neck up to look at Samantha and said, &quot;It certainly wasn&#39;t the dream wedding either of us planned.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; agreed Samantha, holding her wife closer. &quot;I never meant to turn you into a werecat against your will.&quot;<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t against my will,&quot; protested Frances, &quot;and if you&#39;re still carrying any kind of guilt over that after all these years, don&#39;t! I never wanted to be a weredog, but even if I somehow wound up with a different fursona other than being a werecat, as long as I have you, I&#39;m happy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Honey, I&#39;m sorry for all the shit that happened today. You have no idea how much you mean to me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yes I do,&quot; purred Frances, before she kissed her wife. &quot;Now, it has been a long day and I&#39;m tired. How about we drain the tub, dry off, and go to bed?&quot;<br />
&quot;With pleasure,&quot; said Samantha, as a smile crossed her feline face.<br />
<br />
At first, two towels were used just for what the manufacturer intended their purpose to be, as Samantha and Frances Twist used them to dry each other&#39;s furry bodies as the Jacuzzi tub drained for the night.<br />
But soon the playfulness of two lesbian werecats in love arose, as Samantha wrapped her towel around Frances&#39; waist, pulled her close, and gave her mate a deep and passionate kiss.<br />
Linen against hard nipples and between legs that were quickly becoming wet from another kind of moisture were soon forgotten as the lovers embraced and kissed more, while each ran their paws tenderly across their mate&#39;s body.<br />
Then Samantha opened the bathroom door and smiled before picking Frances up in her arms.<br />
Frances pressed herself closer to her wife&#39;s body and started nuzzling Samantha&#39;s neck as she was carried into their bedroom.<br />
Samantha gently laid her wife down upon the bed they shared, and then started kissing her way up Frances&#39; body.<br />
The tips of her feet, her ankles, knees, nothing was left untouched as Samantha continued moving her mouth upward, allowing her breasts to drag across Frances in her wake.<br />
Frances swooned as Samantha caressed her inner thighs and kissed a path to her furry chalice.<br />
Yet Mrs. Twist was totally surprised when her wife only gave that treasure trove a lick and a kiss on her exposed clit before Samantha continued kissing her way up Frances&#39; body.<br />
<br />
Soon Frances realized what was upon her wife&#39;s mind, as Samantha cuddled Frances in her arms.<br />
Then one paw started drifting its way back down towards the cherished space between Frances&#39; legs as Samantha started kissing and orally worshiping Frances&#39; breasts.<br />
Frances started returning the favor by nuzzling her wife&#39;s neck and playing with Samantha&#39;s ears as Samantha&#39;s talented tongue teased the tip of one nipple before suckling upon it.<br />
Samantha&#39;s paw wasn&#39;t idle, as Frances started feeling herself growing wetter by the second as talented fingers caressed the opening to her hidden depths and teased the hooded clit above.<br />
Both werecats started purring like crazy, but it was Frances who arched her back and moaned as an orgasmic wave of bliss washed over her.<br />
Samantha continued her actions for several moments after her wife&#39;s orgasm concluded, until she realized something wasn&#39;t quite right.<br />
&quot;Frances?&quot; said Samantha gently.<br />
At first, Mrs. Twist was starting to grow worried because there was no reply.<br />
Then Samantha realized that there was a smile on Frances&#39; furry face as she started purring in her sleep.<br />
&quot;Oh honey,&quot; said Samantha, as she tenderly kissed her wife on the lips.<br />
<br />
Being able to see in the dark, neither Twist had bothered to turn on a light.<br />
Samantha snuggled up against the sleeping form of her mate and stared at Frances.<br />
<i>My love. I never got the chance to talk about it, and maybe tonight wasn&#39;t the time after all. I know how much you want to bring OUR child into this world, one that is the biological creation of you and me. Unfortunately that will never be. But we&#39;ve proven ourselves to be great parents when Ben needed us after our friends, his parents, died in that auto accident. After he graduates high school, I promise you we&#39;ll adopt again, and this time we&#39;ll wait until there&#39;s a female werecat that needs two loving mothers. She may not be genetically ours, but that won&#39;t stop us from being a family.</i><br />
Then, after another gentle kiss, Samantha curled up next to her wife and fell asleep the way they always do, in each other&#39;s arms at the end of the day.</p>
