<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samuel was awoken by an alarm clock and she instinctively hit the snooze button and burrowed her way further into the bedsheets. She lightly closed her eyes and tried to get a few more minutes of sleep. In another eight minutes it started blaring again and she felt a grogginess overtake her as she sat up and turned it off rubbing her eye as she went. She rose to her feet and instinctively grabbed a towel before shuffling across a hallway to a bathroom. She hadn’t seen the layout to the house before but her body was on autopilot. She sat down to take a pee and stripped her clothes off before stepping into the shower still half asleep.<br />
<br />
The first drops were frigid and for the first time all morning she blinked awake and realized something was off. The water collected in her hair more and it flowed down her body in different ways, plus her morning wood was completely absent and she hadn’t started the day by rolling atop Renee and fucking her before work. It slammed into Samuel like a truck that she was in fact in a woman’s body and memories of the day prior remained caught in her brain.<br />
<br />
“No, this isn’t possible, I must be dreaming,” Samuel laughed as the cold water caressed her body, “I’ll wake up any second now...”<br />
<br />
Samuel didn’t wake up though and simply sat under the water doing nothing much longer than necessary. Eventually she glanced at shampoos and conditioners on the ground and plucked the shampoo up. She squirted some on her hand and began to massage it into her hair. She shut her eyes and hummed happily to herself at the feeing of her scalp being massaged. The motion began to drive new thoughts and memories into her mind and the cleaning of her hair became automatic. Samuel scrubbed it with shampoo and followed this with conditioner. She then washed her body off and rinsed her skin. It felt nice and she stepped out of the shower feeling refreshed and approached the mirror. She wasn’t sure why she was staring at it but after drying her skin off and letting the fan carry away a lot of the moisture she began to comb her hair, straighten out the slight waviness, and tied it back in a neat and clean fashion. She stared at the makeup and other beauty supplies and her mind basically went into autopilot. She plugged her phone into a stereo and began playing music as she touched foundation and began to apply it, messily at first but it quickly became quicker and more expert. She walked out of the bathroom with makeup on her face and her hair done while confusion as to how she achieved this was scrawled across her face.<br />
<br />
Getting dressed proved to be even weirder. She didn’t know how to do up a bra, she was a guy dreaming after all so why would she. So instead she slid on panties, a pair of socks, and nice jeans that framed her bottom. Instantly memories seemed to enter her mind and she put on a bra with no issue before pulling a nice geeky shirt over her head. It was the same type of shirt Samuel always wore, a logo for a superhero or a reference to a comic book, anime, or movie. In reality the room didn’t look that much different from how Samuel used to live at home and it only reinforced the idea that this was all a dream.<br />
<br />
Now that she was dressed she stared at her reflection completely unsure of what to do. She picked up her cell phone and found no messages on it and the calander still made it out to be the spring after universities had let out. So curiosity overtook her and she exited the room taking a good look around the house. She walked up to a framed picture and stared at her reflection in it. Contained behind it was the female appearance she was locked in now and two people who looked like the girl she was. The couple looked to be in their fifties and maybe even sixties. The three of them were bunched together and dressed nicely. She had a graduation cap on and it dawned on her that she was staring at her high school graduation photo. The girl she was looked very pretty and had a large undone golden scarf on her neck that wasn’t part of the usual graduation garb. Samuel knew she had seen one at her own graduation but she had been drunk during it so she couldn’t even remember. Whatever it was must have been important but she couldn’t place it. <br />
<br />
She turned and walked slowly down the stairs passing more framed pictures of her appearance before she entered the living room. It was wide and open with a lot of decoration. That older man from the picture, the girl’s father, was seated in a recliner watching the morning news.<br />
<br />
“Morning sweetie,” he greeted her while she stared at him awkwardly and looked about the room. She was about to say something when he spoke up, “I think one egg will do it today.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Samuel asked while falling out of her trance.<br />
<br />
“For breakfast, just one egg will do today. I’m not feeling too hungry,” the man explained before Samuel turned and entered a spacious kitchen. Baking sat on the counter, a beautiful looking pie, and a clear cookie jar with the most picturesque cookies imaginable.<br />
<br />
Renee had done the cooking and when she was alone it had been her mother. Samuel had no idea what she was doing and once she got eggs from the fridge and a pan she thought she was ready to start so she turned up the heat to max and prepared to figure out how to break an egg. She paused however and put the egg down and returned to the fridge for some reason. She was confused as to why she was doing this and reached out picking up the margarine and returned to the stove. She put it down and opened it before grabbing a knife and scooping a bunch out. She then scraped it into the pan and it began to sizzle.<br />
<br />
Something inside her was changing. She reached into the cupboards and pulled down garlic, salt, pepper, and other spices. She felt a giddy feeling in her, a feeling of joy and a smile cracked across her face. She turned the heat down, walked to the fridge, and took out a sausage placing it on the counter. Her hands grabbed a cutting board and knife before she reached for an apron on a hook and slung it around her neck. She tied it and automatically began to slice circular cuts of the large sausage. Samuel put toast down and placed more pans on the stove. She pulled potatoes out and quickly peeled and diced them before dumping them into a pan. Her body was in autopilot and as it cooked Samuel stopped being confused and her thoughts began to match the actions. She cracked eggs perfectly, knew how long toast took, and was thinking three steps ahead. Her mother came down and placed a kiss on her cheek before heading to the den to join her husband. Samuel was both confused and delighted as she cooked a meal with her own bare hands. She still felt wrong, she was a guy dreaming after all but she also felt right at home like she could stay in this house and cook for these old people forever. That side of her brain was winning out, she was enjoying cooking too much and after she plated and served three plates of it and sat down to eat with them she thought she was done. However a desire began to fill her and once she’s finished she’s filled a sink with soapy water and began to wash dishes. She was baffled at this. She’d Never done dishes in her life before and yet suddenly she was taking care to make sure each dish was clean.<br />
<br />
She didn’t even stop at the dishes in the sink, she unloaded the dishwasher, wiped the counters, and swept the floor before that man and woman wished her a good day and left for work. She’s stood in the kitchen confused as to what was going on and why she was so happy in the kitchen. She wanted to leave and figure out why she hadn’t woken up yet but a new desire filled her and she pulled bowls, mixers, ingredients, and baking trays from the cupboards and started to mix ingredients much to her own bafflement. Once again however she found herself soon directing her body and enjoying it immensely. Containers marked “Do not eat” and “Sam’s” lined the fridge and she got to work mixing flour and sugar with eggs, strawberries with syrup, and cream cheese with milk.<br />
<br />
She combined complex recipes and added her own knack to them all while wondering what her summer job was. She wasn’t even sure if This girl was in university. She was twenty one but Samuel had such a vague memory of her past that she wasn’t sure. She’s just went along with the joyful feeling and began baking cookies, tarts, and preparing a no bake cheesecake. Samuel hadn’t ever realized how fun cooking was and She was happy to keep baking cookies all day until a ring of the doorbell made her leave her station and open it finding a middle aged woman with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Good afternoon Samantha,” the woman greeted her and Samuel froze glancing at the clock and realizing she had been baking for literally hours without realizing it. The woman didn’t stop at a greeting however, “I’m here for that dessert tray.”<br />
<br />
“Wha?” Samuel asked in confusion before blinking and looking backwards, “Um, yeah, just wait near the front door...”<br />
<br />
Samuel stepped away from the woman and walked into the kitchen looking left and right for a dessert tray. She was just lost however and began to pace back and forth until she’s noticed a door at the edge of the kitchen. She approached it and opened the door feeling cold air wash into the kitchen. She’s wanted to shut the door but she suddenly felt drawn towards it and began to creep down the squeaky stairs into an unfinished basement. Something hit her face at the bottom and she screamed but it turned out to just be a light switch. She tugged it and with a click a faint light came on illuminating a fridge and freezer. On a table in a covered tray was a collection of cookies, brownies, and delictable looking desserts that made her mouth water. She picked it up and walked upstairs before the woman happily had her lug it to her car and put it in the back. Samuel then had crisp bills of cash placed in her hand and watched the woman’s drive off still feeling shock.<br />
<br />
All afternoon people showed up to pick up extravagant cakes, beautiful tarts, and fresh bread that she somehow knew how to make. Money flowed into her hands and text messages ordered new things. Samuel was baffled at first but she started to get comfortable with this baking and selling it. She loved the feeling of mixing food, the scent of fresh bread, and the taste of leftovers.<br />
<br />
After finishing for the day she removed the apron and walked outside to a vehicle. Samuel had never owned a vehicle before so this was a strange experience as she went from having no driving ability to being an expert within a few city blocks. She stopped at the grocery store and bought sacks of flour, containers of fruit, and fresh ingredients. Embarrassingly the stock boys helped her lug things to her car. They kept eying her in a way she did when she performed the same task. She did have the outward appearance of a cute girl after all.<br />
<br />
She reentered the house with her supplies and loaded everything up again before her parents even got home. The house was clean and she literally felt like she could keep baking as she sat down in front of the television and just like she had done as a teenager living with her mom played video games. Except now she was a cute girl who was playing them and the afterglow from baking all that food made her so happy. So happy in fact that she didn’t but even resist the urge to go start on dinner. She enjoyed the urge so much that she decided then and there that he didn’t want the dream to end. Even if that meant Renee was gone forever. Samuel decided to ditch her name and let it flow from her mind. Samantha fit her new life so much better and she was so happy  at the feeling of cooking that she never wanted it to end.</p>
