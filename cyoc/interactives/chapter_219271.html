<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was on the floor of Brads room, playing with my, no his train set and blocks, making them train crash in to the blocks, and making the sounds with my mouth, it is really cool watching all the blocks fall around it like it is the real thing, and not what baby&#39;s do right? <br />
<br />
 I would prefer of talking to mom about some stuff, but I did not want to try once again to talk to her, with her and nearly everyone else blacks me all the time, I have to ask like 50 times before I get any answer and the answer is normally like, “shoos Bradly, why don’t you go and play” or normally “no Bradly &quot;or “no, your too little for that”. So yes, I would get no answer or an answer what sound like they are not willing to give to me. <br />
<br />
The only person what still treats me like a human, was the real Brad in my body, but even he normal is to busy talk to me now, with him right now in my old room, playing on what was mine video games, and does not like me bergen in to “his” room, and would normally pick me up and take me out of the room telling me” that I can&#39;t just brag in, and how he knows how annoying it is how people talk to me now but just remember what it was like talking to him when he was in his body” <br />
<br />
And I do remember what Bradly was like when he was in this body, it was relentless! constantly asking the same question, and you just got used to it, and normal just blanke it out,  <br />
<br />
but that can’t be what it is like for me right, sure I repeat myself... multiple times, with nobody answering the first time, it seemed the only thing what gets moms or dads attention is me saying I need to go to the toit, with one of them picking me up and running to the toit, most likely not wanting to bath me 2 times in one day, with this young body&#39;s blader not being very strong and can’t hold for long, so I sound like Brad when he just contently talks? I guess I can’t help it if no one answers me fret time, or even takes my questions seriously now, but whatever Brad normally talks to me when he can, and that will do for now. <br />
<br />
But there are things about Brad what has surprised me as well, like my friends they did not even realize that Brad was in my body, with them came over the other day to do there project and I could not believe that they could not tell how different Brad was at being me, and Brad and my friends seemed to carry on working and talking and joking like normal, what also made me unconfutable with Brad seems to be getting there jokes what seemed way to mature for a 4 year old to find funny, and was also telling jokes what was making them laugh, more than I could get out of them. <br />
<br />
So being Brad sucks most of the time, I do like when I get to cuddle with mom or dad, and how easily this body falls sleeps now but still, but nursery sucks and it seems like I cannot help myself but join in with the other kids what there is a video now what evry one on my family has seen, of me play fighting with Brads best friend, smiling and giggling along with him, I don’t really know how I got into such a state, all I remember was trying to avoid him to day, with it being the first time going to nursery and not wanting to be around little kids, but then he was on top of me and I could not help but fight back, and it just escalated from there, I even said yes to him, inviting me to a sleep over this weekend, after are little play fight. <br />
<br />
And then there was the night two days ago, where dad had his friends around and announced &quot;my youngest son Brad is a genes” with him for the first week, testing if I still had my intelligence and finding it amazing how his 4 year old can do maths what he can belay do of the top of his head, I did like how dad was proud of me, for once being a maths genius with me being the top of my class, before the swap, and now I am a 4 year old it seemed to push him to actually see me for it at lass. But that night just made me hate him seeing how I am a math genius now. <br />
<br />
It started ok, he dressed me up in a white buttoned shirt and black slack shorts what just made me look cute, and once he announced I was a genus he made me stand on a chair and answer questions from the gusts, and will it started off easy stuff, like what is 1+2, with them thinking dad was being. Over the top like he normally is, but once I got like the first ten right they started to say much more harder ones like (23 times 5 and divide that by 4) what I haply work it out in like two seconds, making a lot of them gassp and clap at for me, the thing is if this only lasted like 10 minuets I would be happy, but no this went on and on and ON! Dad even made me play the piano what I still could, even in this tiny body, I find it kind of fun having to kneel on the stool so I can lean my whole boy from one side to the other to reach all the keys, and I could not read music anymore, with it going with my reading skill and telling the time, they even got me piano lessons now, wanting me to learn to read music again, and dad even wants me to go on X factor or something like that what I would not mind doing still.  <br />
<br />
But I know like 6 songs of by heart and played them, what seemed to be a hit with all of dads friends with clapping and when I finely fished the 4th song, what dad asked me to play, they started to ask more math questions again! and dad seemed happy enough to let them, I just wanted to sleep then, it was 11pm and this body bed time was normally at the latest 8pm, so after 30 minutes mom said I mostly collapsed in to dads chest, with him standing right near me, smiling and being to proud showing of his young son. <br />
<br />
It was one of my worst day, me being the “new Brad”, I hated all the people treating me like I was just some little kid, and there relentless asking questions, I just hatted it so much, I felt like a puppet not having any control to say no. <br />
<br />
But not much else has happened in there&#39;s 2 weeks of being Brad aspect mom got me this train today, with me banging the train against the tower of blacks I made, watching them full down, and deciding to make it again and show Brad, because it is cooler than them weird videogames he has been playing for the last week! I can&#39;t believe I use to like them; and play them for hours and hours, I could barely understand what was going on, or how to move my character, when I tried to play them with him, but I better get to work it I want to impress him.</p>
