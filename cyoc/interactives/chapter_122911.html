<br />
Back in the gym, Anna stood by quietly as Trevor left and in a major hurry. She could see that he did his best not knock anyone over, but noticed that he seemed urgent enough that a few other dancers did have to jump out of his way. The whole thing came as something as a major surprise and shock to her. The girl he&#39;d seen Trevor talking with, and under other circumstances, Anna would have been more than happy to be friends with her, but she was with Trevor and Trevor was someone that she&#39;d wanted badly since he had his first transformation. He wasn&#39;t bad looking before, but after his first transformation and were-puberty set in, he became very desirable grade A beefcake. <br />
<br />
While Anna&#39;s specific breed was based off of the Adaptaur, an Australian beef cattle, meant that when she grew up up her chest would never be as large as the largest werecows as beef and draught werecows had an H cup chest, those werecows from breeds raised for both meat and dairy had an I cup chest, while dairy werecows had a J cup. In that, Anna figured she could be at a disadvantage if Trevor showed interest in another werecow, but she was well aware of the advantages she did have. She would be physically stronger than other werecows, which could help if Trevor ever inherited his family&#39;s farm. She figured that would be enough to attract Trevor to her, but at times he just seemed so hesitant. In that she figured to try and be more forward, show that she was one to be desired, but that didn&#39;t work and Trevor had stormed out after the normal girl that Anna had found him talking with. And the threat that he&#39;d made before leaving was enough to even make her nervous. <br />
<br />
Werecattle, male or female, were well known for being gentle by nature, but if angered, their greater strength would mean that ANYONE who got on the wrong end of one, would be in a world of hurt. In this, Anna knew that she&#39;d lost the battle for Trevor&#39;s heart before it even began and that he REALLY liked the normal girl and that trying force anything would only lead to Anna being hurt physically and Trevor hurt emotionally. She then let her tail and ears droop when she figured she&#39;d need to figure out a way to apologize to both of them...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Trevor, meanwhile was panicked by the whole situation. Big things like social dances and so on did lead couples going into the woods behind the high school for some sexual fun, but these were usually limited to couples that were already romantically involved. A part of him wished that that could be him and Melissa, but he wanted to take it slow and to be respectful. Let her first time be a romantic moment, not a moment that would essentially be rape. Even if the boys presently involved weren&#39;t necessarily knowing that Melissa was with him and might have somehow been drugged, that didn&#39;t quite set Trevor&#39;s mind at ease. As Megumi ran ahead of him, he ran after her praying that they&#39;d find Melissa in time.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d lost sight of where Harold Jenkins and Virginia McCoy were, but figured they must have taken a different route into the woods. He only ran after Megumi after the werefox had either heard something or picked up a scent. The only thing that mattered was getting to Melissa, saving her and keeping her safe. And then they came up on the scene, the male werefox had managed to strip Melissa out of her dress and had her pressed against the trunk of a tree. She was naked and Trevor could clearly smell her arousal as the werefox clearly looked interested in her, and his hands moved precisely enough to break her resistance. Though, it did seem to be there.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Melissa gave a low moan, &quot;It&#39;s Trevor that I want...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her voice was heavily aroused, but something in that indicated that her mind was relatively clear. However, that didn&#39;t mean that the werefox knew what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is David,&quot; the werefox spoke as he licked softly at Melissa&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
Melissa, meanwhile, was caught in a hard position to really fight. Love Potion #9 didn&#39;t effect normal humans as completely as it did weres, but it did make them far more open to suggestion than they might be otherwise. The fact that the laced punch she&#39;d consumed had been somewhat diluted had been enough to increase her resistance and give her enough to make her want to try and escape the boys that had led her out here, but something told her that this werefox had ALSO been drugged and the dilution of it had been enough for him to avoid simply pouncing on her in the gym itself, but that didn&#39;t mean he could fully avoid trying to force himself on her. And at the same time, with his instinctive knowledge on how to pleasure someone, he had Melissa going to the point where she really needed it. Her only hope in the back of her mind was that Trevor would arrive and turn her, so she could be what she wanted to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Melissa moaned as the werefox, David ran one paw over her erect nipples, &quot;Trevor is my boyfriend... it is HIM that I want... ohhhhh...&quot;<br />
<br />
But as a normal human, she couldn&#39;t fight off David physically, and as a werefox, he was good enough with his efforts at foreplay that resistance was getting difficult. The only thing that was really her salvation was an enraged voice coming from behind David.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put her DOWN,&quot; came Trevor&#39;s voice in a load bellow, &quot;NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was enough to make Melissa look up to see him with Megumi beside her and with Jason and Roy following along behind them. It served to distract David as well. He hadn&#39;t expected anyone to have followed and to hear another male voice was a surprise. The result was that he quite literally dropped Melissa to the ground and turned to see a very angry looking werebull, blowing hot air through his nostrils and noted that he was pawing at the earth with one foot, his hooves easily digging up the ground beneath him. An obvious threat display, and while David was feeling the effects of Love Potion #9 and couldn&#39;t hide his obvious erection, it was diluted enough to give him the mental faculties to know that this werebull was focused on him and was very angry.<br />
<br />
Melissa was also quick to notice her rescuer, which made her happy. It was Trevor, and he was the ONLY one she wanted. She managed to scramble to her feet and ran to him, thankful that David had never gotten as far as taking off her shoes, and practically leaped at Trevor to get her arm around his neck. It was enough to get Trevor to shift his focus away from David and back toward Melissa. She was still a Normal, judging by her scent, though Trevor could also tell that she was highly aroused at the moment. He was quick to hug her, though more of an attempt to try and cover her up than anything else, and held her to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my shining knight!&quot; Melissa declared, &quot;You came for me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Trevor stated and held Melissa firmly, &quot;I LOVE you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He soon felt Melissa happily kissing his nose as Jason and Rob caught up with them and while Megumi collected the parts of Melissa&#39;s costume that had been discarded as well as her underwear. Thankfully, none of the clothing had been damaged. They might be a bit dirty from being on the ground, but they weren&#39;t damaged.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, too,&quot; Melissa answered happily, feeling warm and safe in Trevor&#39;s arms, &quot;I need you, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; David said slowly noticing the weretiger and werewolf joining Megumi and Trevor, &quot;I didn&#39;t know she was... I just... the punch... it... was sweet... it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were drugged,&quot; Megumi said slowly, &quot;Forgivable, though I will ask, did you spike the punch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I just drank it!&quot; David spoke, knowing Megumi&#39;s family and place in the Skulk and was instantly submissive.<br />
<br />
&quot;We think it was Alice Decrux who spiked the punch,&quot; Trevor said to Megumi, as he held Melissa to him and as she wrapped her legs around his waist and was actually trying to fiddle with the buttons on his jacket. &quot;She owns the sweetshop that supplies the candy for the dance...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The candy was tested,&quot; Megumi said slowly, &quot;it wasn&#39;t drugged... Can you prove she drugged the punch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not reliably,&quot; Trevor admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then there may be nothing we can do in that regard,&quot; Megumi answered, &quot;other than maybe hope that one of the school&#39;s security cameras caught her drugging the punch bowl...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Trevor asked to Megumi.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see if the school security officer is present or can be contacted,&quot; Megumi answered, &quot;and go from there with regard to the cameras.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could go somewhere quiet,&quot; Melissa said to Trevor and snuggled against him.<br />
<br />
Trevor looked down but wasn&#39;t sure on what to really do. Melissa was clearly aroused, thanks to the drug and what the werefox had tried, but with him there had focused a lot of her efforts on him. And while he personally would love to be with her and turn her, he didn&#39;t think rescuing her from a drugged werefox was entirely the sort of romantic moment they&#39;d agree to wait for. However, her arousal and her attention to him was starting to have some effect, and if he were to transform her, he&#39;d need to turn back to his human form so that he could safely fit inside her. A lot of those thoughts floated through the back of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would suggest taking her home and were she can put on her regular clothes,&quot; Megumi said slowly, &quot;if this is Love Potion Number Nine... even if it was diluted, it will take time for her metabolism to burn through it. Shoot... it&#39;ll even take weres some time to burn through it, if the dosage is high enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor looked down and felt Melissa snuggle against him, &quot;I wanted to make her happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think chasing her out here... saying you love her in front of everyone and seeing that she was actually looking for YOU,&quot; Jason commented, &quot;I&#39;d say you did. The typical knight in shining armor coming to her rescue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She shouldn&#39;t HAVE to be rescued,&quot; Trevor spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Megumi commented, &quot;but we cannot change what has happened, and you have acted the way any man would act to protect the woman he loves, and from the way she continues to stay close to you... it is clear to me that she loves you in return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Trevor,&quot; Melissa cooed to him. A part of her voice made it pretty clear what she wanted, but a good part of Trevor&#39;s mind was of the opinion that much of Melissa&#39;s urges were more due to the drug than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you seen her father or Ms. McCoy?&quot; Harold asked, &quot;I saw them come out here before we did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor then set Melissa down and Megumi was soon helping him get back into her clothes. She still smelled highly aroused, but she seemed to go along putting her clothes back on. Melissa also kept her focus on Trevor. Trevor smiled politely and eventually held Melissa to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll need him to be able to open the doors to their home,&quot; Trevor continued, and ignoring that Melissa&#39;s street clothes were at his house.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... your place,&quot; Melissa said with a  small smile. Her mind was starting to clear a bit, mostly because of the fact that the drug that she&#39;d drunk was diluted and lost potency. However, that part of her saw Trevor coming to her rescue, remembered him saying he loved her in front of the two weremers, Eric and Julie, and could see his gentleness with her and some of his unease with the overall situation. It showed his want to follow his promise to her regarding her first transformation and that came off as rather romantic. &quot;My clothes are there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can bring them by tomorrow morning, or you can get them tomorrow evening at dinner,&quot; Trevor told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or... we could go tonight and be happy and be together,&quot; Melissa said with a smile, &quot;You love me... you wouldn&#39;t have come out to rescue me if you didn&#39;t... and in way... you&#39;ve  been romantic... honorable...&quot;<br />
<br />
She then leaned against Trevor and wrapped her arms around him. Trevor nervously looked to her for the moment was nervous that she was simply responding to the drug&#39;s urges. As much as he&#39;d like to, he wouldn&#39;t do anything that would come off as forcing her or against her wishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while some things are... hazy...I think it&#39;s wearing off...  and I have seen how good you are to me,&quot; Melissa spoke, &quot;I may not think that we&#39;re ready for a wedding proposal... with all you&#39;ve done and been willing to do for me... I think I&#39;m ready be with the man I love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor smiled at the obvious declaration of love, as it seemed to warm his heart and get the fear that something would happen to her out of his system. However, given the situation, it was probably better that that sort of thing wait for a night when she hadn&#39;t been drugged that could create issues.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love nothing more,&quot; Trevor admitted, &quot;but your dad was also a bit worried... and we haven&#39;t seen him yet since we came after you. He and Virginia are still looking for you. He might be rather miffed if you turn up a werecow when he thinks that you were drugged.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa didn&#39;t answer and Trevor simply held her to him before he continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you are certain... and are ready... maybe we could arrange that for tomorrow... we have lunch, I welcome you into were society and I&#39;m sure my mom would then help with at getting the new wardrobe to fit the new you,&quot; Trevor said softly to her, &quot;from there... the reintroduction with your dad before bringing him over for dinner... all with your mind being perfectly clear and isn&#39;t being influenced by a drug.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise?&quot; Melissa looked up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;Your welcome will be because you truly want it and are ready for it... and it will be as romantic as I can... not because a drug is making you horny.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Melissa let Trevor turn to walk her out of the woods. As he moved to walk out, he looked back to Megumi who had David standing nervously and submissively nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you could find Harold Jenkins, he should be a weretiger in a toga, let him know that Mel is safe and still a normal, and that I&#39;m taking her back to get her clothes and then taking her home,&quot; Trevor said to her.<br />
<br />
Jason and Rob nodded, as did Megumi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Trevor,&quot; Megumi nodded, &quot;I believe I saw both near the punch bowl. I will let them know...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a silence that followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if the security footage does show that Decrux spiked the drinks, the Skulk will be informed of an illicit prank made against a Skulk member and a Normal,&quot; Megumi promised, &quot;that might allow for the pressure needed get the police to put her in jail and HOLD her there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor nodded. He really didn&#39;t care whether or not Megumi told her grandmother about David being drugged. His only care was Melissa, and she&#39;d been through a lot. The death of her mother, the grieving of her father, and some wereraccoon who wanted to turn her into a wereraccoon for who knows what reason. That was too much. As Melissa held onto his arm as they walked, there was no way he&#39;d let ANYTHING more happen to her tonight. He&#39;d see to it that she made it home and was tucked in. He&#39;d even sit up and wait for Harold and Virginia if Virginia still had chaperone duties to attend to after Melissa was in bed. As that was the right and gentlemanly thing to do.</p>
