<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan let out a moan as a deluge of wolf spunk ran from her cum soaked pussy. The spent fluid splattering on the floor as Jennifer took a step back, the puddle flowing around Susans form. &quot;Oh my god, mom are you ok?&quot; Susan ran her paws over her stomach as it decreased in volume slightly. &quot;Yea, yea I&#39;m ok.&quot; She said breathlessly, ending with a long &quot;Ahh&quot; as she let her mouth hang open as she remained spread on the floor.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked around the room, everything seemed in disrepair or shredded, and the smell of a public restroom was a fair assignment, a mixture of business and pleasure reeked through the whole building, as if someone had both fucked in every corner of the building and had marked each side as well. &quot;Mom come on you gotta tell me what happened!&quot; Jennifer exclaimed as she stomped her paw. <br />
<br />
Susan barely heard her daughters continuing pestering, her ears had started to ring as her fur grew hot, while her afterglow had lasted a fantasticly long time, her body still craved more. Like a drug she needed that pure euphoria again, especially now since she knew what it felt like for real. She muttered out as if with a hangover. &quot;Go....go get your father, he&#39;ll help me.&quot; Her muzzle turned a wry smile at the mention of her husband.<br />
<br />
Jennifer shook her paws. &quot;What do you mean Dad? He hasn&#39;t been here since...&quot; Jennifer&#39;s voice trailed off as a thundering clack of claws tapped the warped wooden panels. Slowly, methodically. Jennifers eyes sharpened from the suspense, ready to put this new monstrous body of hers to use. The tip of a furred back could be seen moving from the other side of the ripped couch. Jennifer took a step back as Susan cooed. A huge blackened wolf strutted forwards, stopping between Jennifer and Susan. The wolf stared at its daughter before turning to Susan. Jennifer took a step forward. &quot;Mom! Look ou-.....Mom?&quot; Jennifer was cut off as Susan leaned up to the wolf&#39;s muzzle as they began to exchange further saliva, their tongues dancing around each other. Susan loved the feeling of Johnny&#39;s sharp teeth on her tongue, the electricity as he felt the same. <br />
<br />
After the years of starting to raise their first cub Johnny grew more and more easy with his animal forms, Susan always the ever present comfort as nearly three years ago to the date, he just never changed back. Susan of course was ecstatic, using the opportunity to chase her libido, barely noticing how long it had been since he last stood on two paws. Martha on the other hand was crushed, the man she had swooned for so long for was only a man on the inside, but her tempered love wouldn&#39;t let her leave, not now. Not when he&#39;s musk was around her. Martha laid in the corner as she began to trace the outline of her canine folds at the sight of the couple kissing. Martha&#39;s mind wondered, if she was lucky she could get to his delicious seed that was now spreading on the floor, maybe she could even help the princess.<br />
<br />
Jennifer grabbed her brow, her ears dipping low as she grunted. Now in the vicinity of Susan, her mind as well had started to warp to this reality. Jennifers memories flooding to remember her fathers past. &quot;No that&#39;s not right...&quot; she muttered. She tried to place her dad&#39;s face, his human face, each time the visage of a wolf flashing in return. She looked around, the smell becoming weaker by the second, or rather her mind getting used it, the smell becoming blind to her. The clawed walls and warped panels started to feel familiar, comfortable, her home. Jennifer staggered backwards, her consciousness reeling, looking through her paws Jennifer watched her mother.<br />
<br />
Susan desperately reaching with her arms to hug Johnny, her small frame only allowing the tips of her paws to glance his shoulder. She loved how big he was, the size difference made his dick ever closer to perfection. Susan moaned as her outstretched arms gripped his ragged fur, her fingers barely able to reach his imposing biceps. Susan&#39;s body dimishing even further as she struggled to keep tongue locked with her husband. His head seeming larger and larger in proportion. Susan spied her eye downward, his massive member beginning to slide out yet again. Susan&#39;s mind overran with thoughts of sex, she wanted to be breed, no she needed to be breed. Johnny needed a pack. Susan already instinctually gyrating her hips. The whipped topping only to see Martha&#39;s face as she bore her husband another kid.<br />
<br />
Jennifer gasped as the house began to change again, dishes rattling, walls groaning, yet noone reacted, each caught in their own headspace. Jennifer looked down as the remaining vestiges of her clothing had disappeared, only her fur to greet her. Thankfully she was furry enough that her nipples were long since buried, the same as her labia, a thick stretch of fur sprouting from her groin. Her mind burned as it wasn&#39;t long till the memories of her wearing clothes was scorched from her mind. Jennifer staggered out of the house, the screen door shaking back and forth. She felt like she was going to loose herself completely if she stayed in there. It had to have been Kyle, the little freak casted a spell or made a potion or something, that call was too conspicuous.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked back at the shack, could she really leave her mother back there? What if she was just wrong and just made things worse? Jennifer&#39;s tail shuffled slowly as she paced nervously in doubt. She had to make a decision. Her ears perking as she started to hear moans coming from the swinging door, flashbacks of the debauchery taking place hitting her eyes with each apex. Susan taking the full force of Johnny&#39;s shaft as Martha had circled around, sneaking a few licks of his balls before returning to cleaning the floor with her tongue. Jennifers mind desperately wanted to throw the images away, but her body didn&#39;t agree with her. It felt familiar, comfortable, just like home. &quot;NO! No no no!&quot; Jennifer bellowed out as she casted her gaze away.</p>
