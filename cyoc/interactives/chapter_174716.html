<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tanya woke the next morning when her Mum knocked on the door to say she was leaving for work. <br />
<br />
&#39;Okay Mum&#39; she sleepily replied, only to be surprised by the strange voice that came out of her mouth, The memories of last night quickly returned to her. She was in Mary&#39;s body and had to make sure her parents didn&#39;t see her.<br />
<br />
&#39;Are you alright? You sound different&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m fine. I guess my throat is just a bit dry. Has Dad gone?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes he just left. If you don&#39;t mind would you put the washing out when the machine finishes. I&#39;ll bring them in when I get home&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Okay Mum&#39; she tried to sound more like herself but didn&#39;t know how to modulate Mary&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&#39;Are you sure your not coming down with something? You sound very different&#39;<br />
<br />
Nancy in the next door room had woken when Mrs Morrison had knocked on Tanya&#39;s door. He had heard the whole conversation and decided to intervene. He also knew that he had to prevent Mrs Morrison from seeing Tanya. Nancy, wearing Chris&#39;s body opened Chris&#39;s door and said &#39;Morning Mum. I can put the washing out for you. You head off to work. We&#39;ll have everything ironed and put away before you get home&#39;<br />
<br />
Mrs Morrison was stunned. Chris rarely volunteered to do anything. He really was growing up. First last night he had volunteered to walk Nancy home. Now he was volunteering to do chores. Did he even know how to use an iron? She was very pleased and totally forgot about Tanya sounding so strange. &#39;Why thank-you Chris&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You look really nice in that outfit Mum. That blouse matches your eyes&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;W...Why thank-you Chris&#39; Mrs Morrison was perplexed. This was so totally unlike Chris. However she was also very pleased. She liked to look after her appearance and to get validation from an unexpected source made her very happy. She left the house with a swing in her step.<br />
<br />
Once the car was gone Tanya left her room. The now redhead was grateful for Nancy to distract her Mum but warned her that the real Chris was never up before 8 am unless he had to go to school.<br />
<br />
Nancy took the criticism in his stride. Angela was a bit of a neat freak of a mother. Since Nancy had turned 10, it had been one of her chores to iron washed clothes, fold them carefully and put them away. &#39;So when can I become myself again?&#39; he asked Tanya.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m not sure whether the 12 hours start when you touch the medallion in which case you could change at 8 or when your changes finished which would be 8.30. I won&#39;t be able to change myself until 9 or 9.30&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;So we have an hour before its even worth trying. Would you mind if I go for a run. I really want to try this body out&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Doesn&#39;t worry me. I guess you will be able to find appropriate clothes. However be back before Chris returns&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;So are you still planning to make that body taller?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s the plan. We could really do with another tall player. Today will be the only chance. Mum doesn&#39;t work tomorrow or Saturday&#39;<br />
<br />
In Nancy&#39;s excitement about testing out Chris&#39;s body she forgot to mention about Chris twisting her ankle on the walk home last night. He hurried back to Chris&#39;s room and began looking for clothes appropriate for running in.<br />
.......<br />
Meanwhile at the Spencer house. Angela had woken who she thought was her daughter very early (7 am) wanting to examine the ankle.<br />
<br />
&#39;The icing seems to have worked it&#39;s not as bruised as I feared, however the swelling isn&#39;t good. I think it probably broken&#39;<br />
<br />
Chris did not enjoy hearing that diagnosis. How was she going to get back to her own house and swap back with Nancy? &#39;I&#39;ll test it out and see how it feels. I need to visit the bathroom anyway&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;ll watch while you try&#39; said Angela.<br />
<br />
What Angela got to see was her daughters face screw up in pain when she tried to put any weight on it. Like last night she ended up being supported by &quot;Mum&quot; as she hopped to the toilet.<br />
<br />
Once more Chris despaired as she sat on the toilet peeing. She reasoned that if she couldn&#39;t get to the Morrison house, Nancy would have to come here. She found it humiliating to have to ask Nancy&#39;s mother to help her walk to the sink so she could wash her hands. There she looked in the mirror to see Nancy&#39;s reflection. Nancy with slightly dishevelled hair wearing a satin pink nightie. Chris found her eye&#39;s tearing up and soon was sobbing with despair. All this was going to be for nothing. With this ankle, even with &quot;Mary&quot; they wouldn&#39;t have team. And that probably mean&#39;t the date with Nancy would be cancelled.<br />
<br />
&#39;What&#39;s the matter darling?&#39; Angela asked., putting a comfortable arm around who she thought was her sobbing daughter<br />
<br />
&#39;I won&#39;t be able to go on my date tonight&#39; came out of her mouth before she could hold it back.<br />
<br />
&#39;Date? What date? You hadn&#39;t told me about a date&#39;<br />
<br />
Chris realised she had let the cat out of the bag &#39;Oh it doesn&#39;t matter&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;It certainly does matter. Who were you going on a date with?&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;Yes who little sis? The hunk who was here last night?&#39; Chris hadn&#39;t realised that Alison was also in the bathroom. Chris blushed. That gave Angela and Alison the answer they sought. &#39;When were you going to tell us?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I thought he was being very tender towards you when he carried you in here last night. How long have you two been an item?&#39; asked &quot;Mum&quot;<br />
<br />
Between sobs Chris replied &#39;Only yesterday. ........ We were going to have a meal ...... and see a movie. .... Now that&#39;s ruined&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh honey there will be plenty of time to have that date. Besides we don&#39;t even know whether the ankle is broken, let&#39;s not despair until we get a proper diagnosis. Here let me help you back to bed. I&#39;ll bring you a bowl of muesli then ring the medical centre and see if I can get you an appointment&#39;<br />
<br />
10 minutes later Chris was back in Nancy&#39;s bed finishing off a tiny bowl of muesli, Mrs Spencer had just informed her that the earliest appointment she could get to have the ankle seen to was 11 am. Chris was supposed to have been back in her correct body by then. She found herself sobbing once more. These female hormones were really playing with her head.<br />
......<br />
Meanwhile Nancy returned from his run, sweaty but really impressed by how athletic his body was. He found &quot;Mary&quot; in the kitchen making breakfasts for the two of them. &quot;Mary&quot; was wearing one of Tanya&#39;s dresses, she had showered and washed her red hair. <br />
<br />
&#39;We should be able to change the two of you as soon as Chris get&#39;s here. I&#39;m thinking once I&#39;ve made this body tall we might go shopping. I&#39;ll need some clothes for &quot;Tall Mary&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh that reminds me. Chis stood in a pothole and twisted her ankle last night. It was swollen when I left her&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Do you think she will be able to get over here?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;&#39;Er not sure actually. She was walking on it for a while but looked like it was pretty sore. Mum made me pick her up and carry her into the house once she saw it&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;d better ring her to check she can still get here&#39; Tanya was already dialling &quot;Nancy&#39;s&quot; number on her phone. The phone in &quot;Chris&#39;s&quot; pocket began to ring. Tanya recognised Nancy&#39;s dial tone. Tanya glared at Nancy &#39;You should have left that phone with her&#39;. Tanya then tried Chris&#39;s phone. They heard the answering ringtone from upstairs. Clearly Chris was without a phone.</p>
