<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Derek reached the corner and scrutinized the jock for a few seconds, thinking about his next move. The kid was tall, but looked young and gangly, especially now, with his enlarged feet. He said he was going to soccer practice after this, so he should probably get a move on. Derek decided to go with him to see what happened.</P>
<P>"Alright, listen up," Derek said, doing his best to be authoritative to someone bigger than him. "I'm going to watch your soccer practice, and you will do everything you normally do, and then see me immediately afterward. By the way what is your name?"</P>
<P>"Chris. Chris McNamara."</P>
<P>"Alright, Chris, let's go." </P>
<P>"Yes, master." Derek almost told him to call him by his name, but decided against it. He kinda liked being called master, at least for now. They walked the short distance to the University field, and Derek took a seat, and Chris headed for the locker room. When they arrived, there were already quite a few players out on the field. And, Derek noticed, some were barefoot. He couldn't resist a smile.</P>
<P>Chris entered the nearly empty locker room, and immediately got hard. Subconsciously, it was because one of his teammates had walked by in flip flops, but Chris didn't consciously realize this. He just did his best to hide it. Wood in a locker room was not good. He got dressed at a leisurely pace, not noticing how empty it was, until the coach was walking out of his office.</P>
<P>"McNamara! Get your ass movin! It ain't <EM>good</EM> for Freshmen to be late."</P>
<P>"Sorry, coach," Chris said and hurried himself up. The coach stopped to look him over, just to scare him and make him think he was reconsidering his spot on the team. It was one of his favorite things to do to Freshman, so they didn't get too cocky. However, when the coach's gaze reached the floor, his eyes nearly popped out of his head.</P>
<P>"Sheezis, kid, yer feet are huge!! How did you ever find cleats?!" Chris looked down, puzzled, and saw his feet. Wow, they did look pretty big...and suddenly, he looked at the coach, the puzzled look gone, and replied, "Oh, I had a growth spurt over the summer," he said, casually. "The shoe store down the street actually, had my size, but I just got these today, so..."</P>
<P>"Say no more," coach said, distantly, never taking his eyes off Chris's size 25 feet. "Just practice barefoot. But break 'em in soon," he finally lifted his eyes to look at Chris, who was changed out by now. "We got a game in two weeks." And with that, the coach walked out, followed by Chris who was barefoot.</P>
<P>The practice went on without incident. Apparently, Chris didn't get close enough to the other barefoot players for anything to happen. Derek watched from the bleachers, noticing Chris had quite the largest feet on the team. He could also overhear most of the team talking about it, though Chris seemed oblivious. Those who didn't know him, commented on the kid with the big feet. Those who did, whispered about what happened to their friend. Derek even heard some comment on how his bigger feet improved his ball handling skills. Toward the end of practice, Chris's girlfriend showed up, and, while the coaches' had their back turned, Chris and his girlfriend went at it like lab rats. Derek was a little surprised by this, and couldn't tell if the girl could tell about the feet, but one thing was for sure: she was hot. The two seemed to be one person, until the whistle blew, and they pulled apart, and she just....left.</P>
<P>Chris jogged quickly into the locker room with lipstick smears and a big grin on his face. He pulled of his clothes, and headed for the showers. Just as he turned on the water, his friend, Jason entered the showers.</P>
<P>"Hey, Chris, what--" but before he could finish, Chris turned toward him and immediately became hard and shot a load all over Jason. Jason immediately got under the shower head and tried to rinse it off as if it were acid. "Jeez, Chris, beat off toward the wall will, ya?! I know Gina's built, but...jeez!" The heavy jizz had come off, but there  was still some sticking to his chest, in the sprinkling of hair he had. Jason grabbed a cloth and began wiping, while Chris walked quickly out of the shower, freaked by what had just happened. Jason didn't notice it, but even though he was wiping it off, there was a tingling in his feet, which were just a little bit bigger than a moment ago</P></p>
