<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Auron only had one class that day, but thank goodness. The entire time, he found himself purring at the feel of something rubbing against the back of his pants. The Third Law of Motion was peanuts compared to how he felt so good in that costume. People commented that his lips looked more puffed out and his lips darker. He said it was just herpes, but it was better to lie than to get concern about it. Following the lecture, he got a rare hamburger at the courtyard and headed home as fast as he could. Luckily, he was able to make it before Kevin did, and he quickly put costume back on marvelling at the texture and the material of it. He sighed contented as he went to lie down on the couch, basking in the sunbeam over the wind. He wanted to look good for Kevin. Why that was, he couldn&#39;t figure out, but he couldn&#39;t force himself to repress the urges. He just liked the costume that much.<br />
<br />
By the time work ended, Kevin was feeling more than anxious, he was irritable and impatient, he just wanted to get back home and wear his costume. He drove, speeding most of the time, then literally ran up the flight of stairs all the way up to the 14th floor, too impatient to wait for the elevator. Breathless, he fumbled with his keys and opened the door rushing to his bedroom to put on his costume. When he was finished, he started to purr as he rubbed over his body He felt himself grow hard again, but he didn&#39;t care. He put on some briefs over the anatomically correct leopard sheathe as courtesy for modesty, the bulge of his own cock beneath pressing against his costume, to hide his obvious arousal. Little did he know, he was releasing his own charged musk into the air.<br />
<br />
He strode out of his bedroom and saw Auron, in full costume, lounging on the couch stretched out in his costume in the sunbeams. Kevin approached slowly and sat in an empty spot next to Auron&#39;s head then said with a slight lisp, &quot;Hey Auron, how was your day?&quot;<br />
<br />
Auron rolled his head against Kevin&#39;s lap, his body rubbing against Kevin&#39;s. &quot;It was perfect. I missed you.&quot; He said, rubbing against him affectionately. He didn&#39;t know why, but Kevin smelt wonderful. sitting up, he stroked his chin against his shoulder. &quot;You smell different today. I don&#39;t know what it is though.&quot; As he sat very feline like, he didn&#39;t realize he was giving off a musk of his own through the costume. He looked wonderful at the moment. It made the nub underneath his costume writhe, the sensation of it stroking against his costume sending shudders all over his body.<br />
<br />
Kevin sniffed the air drawing in a heavenly scent coming from Auron, &quot;I missed you too Auron. You smell nice by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
A content smile was plastered all over his face beneath the mask, so much so that the facial feature of the mask also contorted to some semblance of a smile. Kevin started stroking Auron on the shoulders and chest with one hand, enjoying the rubbings his friend gave him. He soon started purring nearly as loudly as Auron as he turned on the TV with the remote in his other hand. He turned and leaned down and tentatively licked Auron on the head of the costume, his lengthened tongue just long enough to go through the mouth of the costume&#39;s mask, continuing to purr.<br />
<br />
Between licks he said, &quot;you taste nice too *murr*,&quot; As he sat there, cleaning Auron&#39;s head. His dick was still as hard as ever, pushing up against the costume&#39;s sheathe, which Auron&#39;s head rested upon through the briefs.<br />
<br />
Auron let out a quiet gasp as Kevin licked the top of his mask. He noticed a bulge forming in Kevin&#39;s briefs. uncharacteristically, he slowly opened the flap in the boxers revealing the sheathe of the costume, which also seemed to be bulging beneath it. As he saw the bulge on Kevin&#39;s sheath coming out through the costume, he gasped in surprise. With his gloved hand he gently reached out and started to stroke the member. The feel of Kevin&#39;s costumed sheath was so strange and yet so right. He leaned in closer, finding himself getting horny. But he didn&#39;t have a sheath to show his bulge, and found it stuck very tightly in the crotch area of the costume itself, as if it was not designed to contain male anatomy.For some reason, that struck Auron as okay.<br />
<br />
Kevin moaned as Auron stimulated his dick beneath the costume&#39;s sheathe, strangely, the costume sheathe contained an extra stretchy fabric at the area where the animal&#39;s cock would normally come out from it, Kevin watched as his hard dick stretched that fabric thin as it went fully hard under Auron&#39;s ministrations through the hole in his boxers. The head of his cock, looked like it had feline spines on it as the fabric emulated the characteristics of a real feline cock. He was swollen and larger than he had ever been in his life. It didn&#39;t seem strange to him at all that his human male friend was masturbating him. After a few more minutes of their ministrations to each other in which Kevin went from licking Auron&#39;s head to learning over and stroking his back to the to base of the tail, he felt his balls clench then gave a lustful yowl as he creamed himself in his costume. The cum soaked the anatomically correct area of the costume making it stick to his own cock and balls.<br />
<br />
He leaned back panting, his tongue sticking through the mask a bit more.<br />
<br />
Auron felt himself cum as well, overcome by the passion and the musk that was in the air. His costume&#39;s vagina dripped his own cock&#39;s cum crom a narrow slit that was hidden in the fabric until now. He noted that it, soaked in his cum, looked like a wet swollen pussy waiting to be maited. Letting out a yowl of his own, Auron watched Kevin lean back panting, his crotch covered in cum. Purring in delight, he went on all fours as he took his now equally flattened and rough tongue to clean the fur on Kevin&#39;s costume. It was important for them both to be clean wasn&#39;t it? Perhaps what he felt now was what it meant to be wet. His tail lashed underneath his suit at the sound of Kevin&#39;s purring. He felt so strong and powerful. He was glad to be with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You taste so good yourself, Kevin. -mew-.&quot; He purred, not finding it strange that he sounded very cat like. Auron licked at Kevin&#39;s crotch, licking the cum soaked costume clean of it, finding the taste enjoyable. Auron then rested on Kevin&#39;s chest, letting out a mewl as he scratched against the couch.<br />
<br />
Kevin cleaned Auron&#39;s crotch in kind, murring at the taste of his friend and partner. He noticed dimly that Auron&#39;s crotch did not seem as bulbously swollen as it did the day before. Perhaps Auron found a way to tuck his balls in to make the costume look even more authentic?<br />
<br />
&quot;*Murr* that felt good Auron, we should do this more often.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Auron rested, then soon fell asleep in his arms, Kevin stroked Auron softly across the chest and midriff as he too soon fell asleep still hugging his friend. He gave a cavernous yawn before then, baring feline fangs in a slightly stretched out face that now sported whiskers and an upturned pink nose.</p>
