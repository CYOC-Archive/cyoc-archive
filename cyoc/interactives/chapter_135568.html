<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter began to wake up. As he was rubbing his eyes, he started to remember what happened last and thought it might just had been a dream until he rolled around to see Amy fully awake and staring at him in her demon form. <br />
 <br />
&quot;You&#39;re so cute when you&#39;re sleeping&quot; said Amy with her mischievous smile. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I&#39;m cute when I drool while sleeping&quot; responded Peter as he clean the drool on his chin while laughing. <br />
 <br />
&quot;A little bit, yeah&quot; said Amy. <br />
 <br />
She approached him to start to cuddle. At morning, Amy was always a bit horny. She even started to call it her &#39;Lady morning wood&#39; or &#39;morning dew&#39;. She trying to do a bit more than just cuddle. As she trying to fit in Peter arms, she started to caress him at first in chest, than his hips and was going toward his crotch. She felt he already was rock hard. That only made her even more aroused and started to subtly grind her inner thigh against him. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Did you think about what said to you last night?&quot; asked Amy. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Yeah a little bit&quot; he said. &quot;I think I might want to try what most guy do in my place would ask for. I want to try having a foot long cock&quot; he said while smiling like kid making his Christmas gift list. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Really? you don&#39;t think it&#39;s big enough as it is?&quot; asked Amy while laughing in disbelievment at his stereotypical request <br />
 <br />
&quot;Well, I know what you gave me last night is pretty huge, but I want to try at least once to have that kind  of humongous penis&quot; Said Peter. <br />
 <br />
Amy then looked him deep in the eyes and started to kiss him. she was stroking his cock and felt a familiar tingling. the hand of Amy seemed to be smaller and smaller on his shaft as hi dick was growing to this pornstar size. When He finished growing Peter decided to take the lead and flip her on the bed to started fingering her. He made sure to give her clit all the attention it deserved as he gently rub and went back and forth to her lower lips, getting his finger well lubrificated by her now well flowing love juices. Then as he was starting to spread her legs, she stopped him. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Wait a sec&quot; she said. &quot;I don&#39;t want to suffer too much because of your monster dong&quot; she said with a smirk. <br />
 <br />
She closed her eyes and slowly her hips started to widen a bit and it seemed that her vulva was to, slightly bigger than before. Peter understood that she equipped herself as a size queen so it would be pleasurable for her too. <br />
 <br />
She then reopened her eyes and said &quot;Come here big boy, I&#39;m ready for you&quot; <br />
 <br />
Peter didn&#39;t need any other signals and plunged his giant cock in her plump pussy. While pounding her in a missionary position, he couldn&#39;t believe how amazing it was to have to take these deep hips swing to get his whole dick in her. As his shaft was going in and out of her, you could see her tummy bulge when he was entirely in her. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Turn around and climb on me&quot; said excitedly Peter. <br />
 <br />
They flip around started to fuck in reversed cowgirl. The feeling was beyond what he had ever known. He grabbed her ass cheek while she was going up and down on him. She was now screaming in pleasure &quot;Oh FUCK YaSS PETER!!!&quot;. Then he felt her twat was contracting on his cock and had the idea to pull on her demon tail. At that moment she went even crazier screaming and not able to form words and that made Pete go ever the edge. Even couldn&#39;t get her off his dick in time and came in her pussy with huge loads of cums that were proportional to the size of his manhood. Now drained of energy, Amy returned to her human shape and let herself fall on the chest of Peter with her pussy still leaking sperm and they fell asleep again, exhausted of this session. <br />
 <br />
-------------- <br />
 <br />
11h30 am <br />
 <br />
Peter woke up a bit dazed of what had just happened. He had a feeling that he was forgetting something... <br />
 <br />
&quot;OH fuck!!&quot; he screamed. &quot;Come on get up!&quot; he hurried Amy. <br />
 <br />
&quot;What?&quot; Amy asked whist still half asleep. <br />
 <br />
&quot;We have to meet Paul and Nia for lunch to watch the football game at the pub, don&#39;t you remember?!&quot; responded Peter. <br />
 <br />
Her eyes widened ad she got up to jump in the shower with Pete while cursing at herself for being able to forget this. After the shower she then put on a pair of panties and tried to put her jeans. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Godammit, I don&#39;t fit in them any more&quot; she said in frustration. <br />
 <br />
&quot;What do you mean? Can&#39;t you just turn yourself back to the way you were?&quot; Asked Peter in confusion. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Yes and no.. To undo a curse I have to let a couple of hours pass&quot; Responded Amy. <br />
 <br />
&quot;What do you mean a couple of hours??...&quot; Asked Peter. <br />
 <br />
&quot;It depend.. Sometime it&#39;s 5, other 24... I just feel it when I can. And fuck it, I&#39;m putting a skirt, there is no way I&#39;m fitting in these skinny jeans!&quot; Steamed Amy. <br />
 <br />
Peter had a problem of his own, even flaccid, his cock was about 9 inch. When he climbed in his jeans, it looked as he was trying to hide a puppy in his crotch so much the bulge was noticeable. But he didn&#39;t have a choice so he zipped his jeans and they got out of the apartment to go meet with their friends. <br />
 <br />
---------------- <br />
 <br />
12h30 <br />
 <br />
After being and the run for the last hour, trying to catch their bus to get to the meeting place, they were finally there and almost in time.  <br />
 <br />
&quot;Hey Peter-boi! Over here!&quot; Signaled Paul as he spotted his old friend Peter. <br />
 <br />
Peter saw him and made his way to them with Amy. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Sorry for making you wait guys&quot; Apologized Amy. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, we arrived only about 5 minutes ago and we got ourselves a table with a nice view on the TV for the match&quot; gently said Nia. <br />
 <br />
Paul was an old friend of Peter that he met back in High school. He always been a popular guy. He had a very positive vibe and almost everyone liked being around. Back in the days he was a track athlete with a possible future in sport for this young athletic guy of 6&#39;2 of good build, with blonde hairs and green eyes. Well, until he ripped his knee ligament in a stupid ski accident. But that didn&#39;t stop him. He got a degree in admin that didn&#39;t served him much but now was a successful real estate broker at the same company as Amy. Back in the days, Paul was always pushing Peter to get off his ass and go do something, be it a party, some sport or some crazy adventures. He was always the one to call his friend to get something going. <br />
 <br />
Besides Paul, was the shy Nia. She had a strong french accent since Paul met her in France were he did a student exchange. Nia had nice naturally curled black hair that form a big yet cut afro, her skin was mocha colored and while still a petite girl, she had some impressive bosom and a magnificent ass. The timid half African girl had had such an effect on him the a year later he came back to France to meet her again and swore to her that he would get her to come back home in the US with him. And that&#39;s what he did. Since her African father was a really religious guy they even had a big catholic marriage in France before letting her girl go. <br />
 <br />
They sat at the square table with each couple face their loved ones and having Nia beside Peter and Amy beside Paul. They quickly ordered some food and beers to have them before the match began. Finally they had their food and it was kick off time. <br />
 <br />
&quot;I swear, this season you&#39;ve got to put your your money on the Dallas team! Just watch they dominating the game&quot; he exclaimed himself <br />
 <br />
&quot;I sure wish they did. It&#39;s been over 20 yrs since we haven&#39;t seen the cup&quot; said Peter. <br />
 <br />
At the same moment, the football team made a interception, Paul was going crazy with excitements and the Dallas player ran up to the goal zone. &quot;YESS!&quot; screamed Paul as he jumped up from his seat. While doing this,  he hit the table, and this in turn made Peter beer fall on his lap. <br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh god!&quot; Exclaimed Nia. &quot;Look at what you&#39;ve done, you stupid kid&quot; she said to Paul while getting napkins. While she glared at Paul, she tried to dab Peter lap to dry him to make up for her husband&#39;s mistake. While trying to dry his lap she felt  that something huge was there. Her eyes went down to see his humongous bulge. She was in shock and for a second her jaw dropped. Peter trying to seemed embarrassed couldn&#39;t help but letting it show a bit that he was proud of his huge bulge. All of this didn&#39;t go unnoticed from Amy, for whom, when Peter lift his eyes up to meet hers, saw that she was staring at him, fuming with anger...</p>
