<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You had been speedwalking for what felt like an hour… but what had really been about 15 minutes. You looked around, the Mall was still nowhere to be seen, still out of you view. You knew you were going the right way, just not fast enough. If only you could go a little faster…<br />
<br />
You looked to your left,<br />
<br />
“Bingo.”<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
“Emily!” A woman yelled up the stairs, “there’s… a woman asking for you…” the woman says, giving you a suspicious look. It was fairly warranted.<br />
<br />
“Who is it?” Emily says as she walks down the stairs in her pyjamas. She looks you dead in the eyes, “ew, what’s this bitch doing here?” She said to herself. She jumped off the last step and approached you. She turned to her Mom, “it’s alright, she’s my friends Mom,”<br />
“O-okay,” her mother says, stepping back, still suspicious.<br />
<br />
Emily waits for her Mom to exit the view. Once she does, she turns to face you, “well well, Stephanie, right?”<br />
You sigh, “sure,”<br />
“What brings you to my abode? Husband couldn’t milk you?” She asked, making fun of you. Or more realistically, making fun of Skylar’s mother. You open your mouth to tell her the truth of the situation, but before you can, “honk!” Emily says, squeezing your right breast with her hand. You jump backwards,<br />
“Hey!” You say, almost angry, “you have no right to play with my breasts!” You blurt out, almost like it wasn’t you talking,<br />
“Calm down, Steph,” she says again, mocking, “I know my way around a boob,” she says, poking it again, “plus, these aren’t ‘breasts’. These are udders,” she finishes.<br />
You look down, realising that there is a smallish stain right where your— Stephanie’s nipple is. Looks like Mia was right, it was this weeks milking time.<br />
If you remembered correctly, that meant you didn’t only have a limit before Bella made any terrible wishes, it also meant you were on a timer and had to be milked by the end of the hour! You didn’t have time to make Emily milk you, so you had to make sure you were quick.<br />
<br />
“Emily,” you started. She looked surprised, as if it was a shock that you knew her name, “I’m not Stephanie, I’m Yu!” You said,<br />
“Wait wait…” Emily said, trying to figure out what you just told her, “give me more detail,”<br />
“I am your friend Yu!” You exclaimed,<br />
“You’re Yu?” She said, puzzled. She didn’t appear amazed as this did fit within the realm of possibility, but still confused, “prove it,” she asked,<br />
“What?”<br />
“Prove you’re Yu, and I’ll believe you… literally,” she finished, crossing her arms.<br />
<br />
“Oh god,” you said, “uhm…” you tried to think of something. Then it hit, “your celebrity crush, even when we were super young, was always Liberty Williams. You always said you just liked her music, but you were always watching her music videos because—”<br />
“Alright, alright,” Emily said, shushing you, “you’re Yu. I believe you,”<br />
“Thank you. Now I need to get to the Mall,”<br />
“Why?”<br />
You look at her like she’s useless, “I didn’t do this on purpose, did I,” you say,<br />
“Hold on, I mean… I would’ve tried out her body,” Emily said. She snickered, “I just need to grab my book, then I can help you get to the Mall,” she said, “I’ll be back in a second,” she said, racing up the stairs.<br />
<br />
As Emily ran up the stairs, you notice her mother peek through the doorway. She approaches you, “is that really you, Yu?” She asks,<br />
You cringe a little, then chuckle, “y-yeah. It is,”<br />
Her mother places her over her heard, “thank god for that!” She said, “what on earth happened to you!?” She asked,<br />
“It’s a long story…” you said, scratching the back of your neck,<br />
“Summarise it,” she says, “I know you don’t have a lot of time, so make it quick,”<br />
“Alright… ahem,” you clear your throat, “I returned a lady’s handbag, she gave me a ring, the ring grants wishes… basically I made the most ‘bitchy’ girl in school nicer,”<br />
“Wow…” Emily’s mother replied, “so you were able to do all that, just by wishing for it?”<br />
“Basically,” you reply, “but most of it wasn’t done with wishes. Skylar became nice because she was actually nice on the inside,”<br />
“I take it Skylar is the ‘bitchy’ girl,”<br />
“More like ‘was’ the bitchy girl,” you correct, “but the new bitchy girl is why I look like this. She took the ring,<br />
“Interesting…” Emily’s mother says, “well could you do me a favour when you get that ring back?” She began to ask,<br />
“I appreciate the honesty,” you reply, “what do you need?” You ask, but before she can reply,<br />
<br />
“Got it!” Emily says, jumping over the banister of the stairs. Her eyes suddenly widen when she sees her mother, “oh god… you didn’t tell her, did you?” Emily said,<br />
“I’d heard you, Emi,” her mother said, “good luck, Yu. I’ll let you know my ‘wish’ when you bring Emily back. Safely,”<br />
“Of course,” you smile at her, “see you later!” You say, waving, as Emily drags you out of her house.<br />
<br />
“Come on, dude,” she says, “why’d you have to tell my Mom,”<br />
“I didn’t tell her, she overheard us,” you reply,<br />
“Whatever, dude,” she says, “you’re totally gonna owe me for this, by the way,” she says. Starting to scribble something down in her book,<br />
“Actually, good point. What is your plan?” You ask,<br />
“You’ll see,” she says, finishing her writing, “put this between your boobs for me,” she says, handing the small book over to you. You take it, looking down and slowly sliding it into your cleavage.<br />
<br />
You watch Emily as her pyjama top suddenly bursts open, revealing a pair of wings!<br />
They’re scaly, like a dragon’s. Within a few moments, she had sprouted large dragon wings. The scales spread down to her legs, changing the shape of her legs, making her bare feet stretch into much larger talon-like feet. From her tailbone, characteristically, sprouted a long, black, scaly tail. You could see it begin to move on its own as it grew longer. Within a few moments, the dark scales had travelled across her torso, up to her small breasts, covering them with scales. Her arms covered in scales too, her fingers becoming like her feet with talons. She didn’t appear to be a full dragon, still looking humanoid. But still very much not human. Finally, her face was the last thing to change. Her nose and mouth stretched forward to create a muzzle-like face. Her nostrils were very visible. She opened her mouth, showing off a LOT of sharp teeth, allowing her tongue to come out. It was very long, like a snake almost. As the rest of her head changed, it covered with more scales. Her ears pointed as spikes appeared all over her body. Finally, as her eyes changed to a deep emerald green, two long horns sprouted from the top of her head.<br />
She took a deep breath and let out a fierce roar. She turned her head to look at you,<br />
“I just wanted to do that…” she said.<br />
<br />
Without warning, she bent her knees and pounced not the air. Her wings angling downwards to allow for an efficient launch. As she did this, she grabbed you with her feet. She opened her wings, allowing herself to be swept up by the breeze,<br />
“To the Mall!” She shouted, letting out a loud roar as she did.<br />
This was going to be an exciting entrance.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
Emily’s mother burst through the front door, hearing the second body-trembling roar from her own front garden. She looked up to see Yu and a dragon-like woman flying into the distance. She took a wild guess and assumed that was Emily.<br />
A part of her was very intrigued with this whole wishing situation. But she trusted that Yu had it under control… probably.<br />
<br />
She went to go back inside, but as she did… she noticed something on the ground.<br />
She approached it and realised…<br />
<br />
Emily left her book behind.</p>
