<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Dino adventures!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff surveyed his surroundings after a little bit of introspection, realizing that he had forgotten one specific change he should have done to himself to survive in this world. <br />
<br />
He had no idea how to hunt. <br />
<br />
Despite being part of the Tyrannosauridae family, with his human mind restored and his primal mind faded away, he only has memories of his <i>human</i> life, not the life of what he could have lived as half of the dinosaur species that received an anthropomorphic upgrade. <br />
<br />
Therefore, he also only has the skills of a teenager living in the modern world, which usually meant only a handful of skills that couldn&#39;t really be applied in such a prehistoric world with Bronze Age technology. It was only with his boosted intelligence that he managed to discern his shortcomings. <br />
<br />
He sighed and pulled his face in exasperation. &quot;4 more hours before I can make some mental changes to myself. Can&#39;t believe I need the skills that would be considered prehistoric too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at the Chronivac-calculator, he knew he would need a way to store the device safely without it breaking apart in his thick and clawed hands. Sure, he had the body of the apex predator, but definitely not the mind. Despite what he initially thought that no one would mess with him, he&#39;s also smaller than the feral T-Rexes of this world. And if a fight would break out with him and another, he knows he would lose.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would a teenager in a huge and muscular anthro T-Rex body do in a fight with animals? Bite them to death? Punch them till they drop?&quot; Jeff walked to some brambles he could see in the distance, placing the device to his side as he brute-forced the plant matter out of the ground. He did this until he felt that he could weave a small basket if this was how one weaves a rattan basket. <br />
<br />
It took a bit of time, and with only the Chronivac as his watch, he could tell it took him over an hour in the attempts to create a workable handbasket. It would serve him enough that he could store food in the basket rather than his mouth. &quot;Alright, since hunting is out of the question, I&#39;m going to forage for food. Wondering if T-Rexes could eat vegetables with the anthropomorphization, or my theory is wrong and this body would be strictly carnivorous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Placing the device into the basket, Jeff stood up and realized the wind drafting over his junk. &quot;Oh, yeah, I forgot to make myself clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff wouldn&#39;t be able to make even a loincloth with only forageable materials anyway, not even the skills to skin an animal if it came to. He did decide to take a long branch he saw and use it as a weapon. Even if it isn&#39;t that sharp, it should serve him well with his powerful brute strength.<br />
<br />
At least it would scare ferals and anthros alike. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to need a campsite too, thankfully I know how to light a fire with flint on flint, thanks, Dad.&quot; He walked towards what he could see was the entrance to the forest, using his sense of smell and sight to search for food. <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take much, but he heard the Chronivac ping for its first charge. It was already getting dark... and he only managed to scavenge a third of the basket, and even then he had no idea what was edible or poisonous.<br />
<br />
Deciding to not waste his chance with the night, Jeff poured the basket out to retrieve the Chronivac. He clicked on his stats and found the mental change slider. It was once set to 100%, and with the sudden glitch, he caused while being a full raptor that caused this global reality-scale change and the subsequent return of his mind, it was still set to 100%.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, setting it to 50% which should let me maintain my Jeff self while introducing a new persona that would be experienced in this kind of world, skilled to survive until his apparent age of 20.&quot; He also swapped out Carnivorous to Omnivorous. He wasn&#39;t sure what would happen if he did so, but since this would be localized, he would at least be able to eat what he had foraged. Not changing anything else as he could see the shadows creeping in from the sun setting, he quickly pressed submit. <br />
<br />
The loading bar progressed slowly, and Jeff was anxious as the changes progressed as he even had to lift the device up into the air to catch the last few rays of the sun. With such small changes, it was fast as Jeff could physically feel his digestive system tighten as a second stomach took an empty space, being quite small. <br />
<br />
The mental changes were quick. One moment Jeff was just himself, then the second set of memories took its space inside his head as he was overwhelmed with a new personality. The Chronivac pinged with a change complete and it took him a second to realize the unfamiliar yet familiar sound was the device.<br />
<br />
Jahff shook his head as he brought the device down, and Jeff took a look at the loading bar. <br />
<br />
&quot;12 hours until any changes can be initiated.&quot; Jahff was confused, but Jeff knew that it was because there was no more sun. <br />
<br />
Sun protected and let him hunt, but he didn&#39;t hunt.<br />
<br />
He shook his head. It was going to be a while before he could familiarize himself with the dual personalities, but it worked. He could recall memories of being Jahff, and it&#39;s safe to say that Jahff was odd. Born with a second stomach meant to eat &quot;grass&quot;, Jahff set off to live solitarily. It was correct for Jeff to assume that apex predators don&#39;t share territories, as he knows that it&#39;s going to be a while before he would encounter the fully carnivorous species of Tyrannosaurs. A flash of memories revealed that Jahff had indeed impregnated several females with his species before, but Jeff knew it was not true at all, as reality hadn&#39;t been changed. It was forged so that Jahff had the memories and skills of mating rituals and sex itself, which is rough and full of domination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, seems like the memories are all there, along with all the skills that came from Jahff living successfully for 20 years. Hunting, fighting, mating and even crafting skills.&quot; He walked to the forages on the ground, and he immediately realized that only a third of what he gathered was edible, at least to Jahff. <br />
<br />
He separated what he could eat and what he could not, experienced hands doing quick work of the plant matter. He could easily recall, thanks to his higher intelligence that apparently was another &quot;mutation&quot; that had developed in Jahff, the memories that designated which were poisonous, edible, and ones that needed a little bit of processing, which was not many. <br />
<br />
It was already dark with the trees blocking the sun, and Jahff set to work creating a fire. Jahff remembers the normal flint method, while he also apparently remembers the method of friction. He set to work using the wood and stones on the ground to start a fire. It didn&#39;t take much, but the blazing fire on the ground here was proof of his skill.<br />
<br />
Jahff set to work. The inedibles were kept because they were poisonous or had negative effects, which Jahff knew that it could be made into poison spears and the like. Jahff felt a little bit irate that he couldn&#39;t hunt a single game at all, a tarnish on his hunting skills. He shook his head, remembering that he was Jeff.<br />
<br />
Cooking the ones that needed processing and eating the ones he foraged only filled his herbivorous stomach, and it was small too. Despite his grass-eating stomach is full, the empty meat-eating stomach growled for food. His biology automatically sent food he ate that was mostly greens straight into that stomach and refused to send it in to the meat stomach at all. Of course, Jahff knew this. <br />
<br />
&quot;At least the forages filled one of my stomachs,&quot; Jeff muttered even as his other one growled for meat. &quot;One problem being this big and muscular, I need a lot of caloric intake to even feed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jahff went to sleep partially hungry, but he took a quick stroke of his manly dino dick to take the edge off his primal and angry brain having to sleep hungry. He didn&#39;t bother cleaning it as his virile balls splattered the seed all over his chest, growling and reliving the memories of thrusting inside rough females. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt himself be enveloped by Jahff as he fell asleep that night.</p>
