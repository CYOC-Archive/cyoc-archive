<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike kept glancing back at Joe. She...he couldn&#39;t help it; the contrast was just too staggering. He wasn&#39;t sure what he&#39;d expected the end result to be in his case, but the reflection that&#39;d greeted him once he&#39;d worked up the nerve to look in the mirror was that of...an ordinary young woman. Not &quot;plain&quot; in the sense that people normally used it of women, as a polite term for &quot;actually gawky or kind of ugly,&quot; but just kinda...unremarkable. An ordinary face, neither stunning nor unpleasant, and a modest figure, from what he could tell; he hadn&#39;t had the nerve to take his clothes off.<br />
<br />
Which should&#39;ve been okay, really. It wasn&#39;t like this was something he <i>wanted,</i> so not standing out should&#39;ve been a best-case scenario; he&#39;d get through the year like this, finish out his degree and pay off his loans, and then things could go back to normal. There was no reason she - dammit, it was weirdly difficult not to think of herself as a woman; she wondered if Joe was having trouble with it as well - no reason <i>he</i> should want to be any kind of knockout...so it was odd that having his roommate turn into a girl straight out of a vintage pin-up calendar needled him as much as it did. Well, it wasn&#39;t Joe&#39;s fault; the nurse had told him it was just genetics, and it wasn&#39;t like women in his family tended to be stunners...<br />
<br />
He shifted his hips uneasily, still weirded out at the feeling of nothing dangling between his legs. Anyway, it wasn&#39;t like <i>either</i> of their looks were going to be the biggest challenge in getting through the year. He&#39;d thought the &quot;alternative&quot; Dr. Kelly mentioned would&#39;ve been, like, some kind of suppressor, maybe a kind of biotech on/off switch for a woman&#39;s cycle; when the nurse had explained what it <i>actually</i> was, he&#39;d nearly had a freakout. Okay, she&#39;d assured him that it was safe and supposedly less unpleasant than menstruation, but still - what in <i>all</i> the hells!? He bit his lip and tried to think of the pay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Larue?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, what...!?&quot; she said, snapping back to the present conversation. It felt weird to hear her...himself addressed as &quot;Miss,&quot; but he supposed he was probably gonna get a lot of that, over the next year...<br />
<br />
&quot;The school-records thing,&quot; Joe prompted him. She counted off on her fingers. &quot;You know, do we just own up to being us and go back to our dorm, try &#39;n get into the women&#39;s dorm as us, or have them arrange for secret identities and finish out college as...whoever we end up being.&quot; She frowned. &quot;Huh, &#39;Jo?&#39; &#39;Josephine?&#39; I guess &#39;Joey&#39; could be, like, a super freakin&#39; tomboy name...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Kelly chuckled. &quot;To be clear, this would be more of an informal arrangement with the school than a full legal change of identity records. We&#39;d still make arrangements with law enforcement for temporary ID, though; we can&#39;t have our test subjects getting deported, obviously.&quot; She tapped her pen on the blotter. &quot;If you do want to remain female at the end of the trial, we can help you with the paperwork for that, as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike got a weird feeling in the pit of his stomach at that; he brushed it aside and tried to consider the question. The thought of pretending to be a woman made him a little uneasy, but what were the alternatives? He didn&#39;t relish going back to the men&#39;s dorm; okay, a lot of the guys were basically alright, and he liked Joe just fine as a roommate, but it had its share of boorish fratboys as well, and sharing a living space with them as a...looking like a...<i>this...</i>was <i>not</i> an appealing prospect. And that&#39;d go double for Joe, with <i>her</i> looks. But if they went to the women&#39;s dorm under their own names, wouldn&#39;t it make the actual women feel awkward around them? Maybe assuming another identity was the better choice after all...<br />
<br />
&quot;I...think we should go with the cover identities,&quot; he said quietly. It was still weird to hear his new voice...<br />
<br />
Joe nodded thoughtfully. &quot;Probably makes sense,&quot; she mused. &quot;Hm, what do we call you? &#39;Micki?&#39; &#39;Michaela?&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michelle,&quot; she said, a little surprised at himself. He wasn&#39;t sure where that&#39;d come from, but...it seemed obvious enough, as a cognate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh,&quot; Joe grinned, &quot;&#39;Shelly.&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor nodded and produced yet more paperwork. Mike put his surname down as McGill, his mother&#39;s maiden name, and only needed to change one letter in his middle name, Francis, which he&#39;d always had awkward feelings about. Joe dubbed herself &quot;Josephine Jones,&quot; which she thought sounded like a comic-book character. &quot;Call me &#39;Jo,&#39;&quot; she said. &quot;Huh, wonder what I should do for a middle name? &#39;Miranda,&#39; maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike frowned. &quot;D&#39;you want to have the same initials as Jean-Michel Jarre, or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Jo responded. &quot;Nah, it just seems like it fits in there, I think.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Anyway, it&#39;s not even a big legal thing, so I can always change it.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was a good way to look at it, Mike thought; this wasn&#39;t anything permanent...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Dr. Kelly said, when the last (Mike hoped) round of paperwork was done, &quot;that about wraps it up for now. Of course we&#39;ll expect to see you in a month for your first checkup and interview, and should you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, don&#39;t hesitate to contact us.&quot; She took the accumulated stacks of paperwork and stapled them together with an authoritative <i>thunk.</i> &quot;Now, we&#39;ll get in contact with the college immediately, but it may take them a bit to get the housing arrangements sorted. Are you currently staying at the dorms?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jo said. &quot;But we can probably find a place to crash for a day or two, if we have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It shouldn&#39;t take that long,&quot; the doctor replied. &quot;It&#39;s not the first time we&#39;ve done this. But you may as well plan on spending the afternoon in town. Which brings me to your stipend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike blinked. &quot;Our stipend...?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded. &quot;As I said, you can live as you please, but it&#39;s a basic fact that most of your clothes aren&#39;t going to fit the way they used to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No kidding,&quot; Jo laughed, tugging down the hem of her shirt, which was stretched out noticeably and riding up at the waist. &quot;This is one of my looser tees, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Kelly dug into one of the drawers in her desk. &quot;On top of your compensation for the trial, we&#39;ll be providing you with an allowance for clothing, underwear, and other essentials.&quot; She produced two cash envelopes. &quot;I&#39;d suggest that the two of you take the opportunity to go shopping while we arrange things with the school; that way you&#39;ll be all set to move in as two young women transferring in from another college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Huh,&quot; Mike said; he felt a little weird at that, but he&#39;d have to get used to hearing stuff like that for the next year. &quot;I guess that makes sense.&quot; It wasn&#39;t like they&#39;d have to go crazy with it or anything, and he had to concede that his shirt fit oddly right now; too loose at the shoulders, and if it wasn&#39;t as dramatic as Jo&#39;s, still a little narrow in the chest. His jeans felt tight at the hips, too, even though he was practically swimming in them. And, well, wearing clothes that weren&#39;t obviously ill-fitting would help him avoid standing out, right?<br />
<br />
The doctor bid them goodbye, and they were escorted out by security. It felt like an eternity since they&#39;d parked the car, Mike mused, as he slid into the driver&#39;s seat; he spent the better part of a minute adjusting it to suit his altered frame, and then another trying and failing to find a way to lay the shoulder-belt across his chest that didn&#39;t feel weird.<br />
<br />
Jo opened up her envelope as they pulled out of the parking lot, and whistled. &quot;Dang! That&#39;s a pretty good chunk of change there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because we need enough clothes to make for a &#39;starter set,&#39;&quot; Mike mused. &quot;Otherwise we&#39;d be running laundry every couple days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That, and women&#39;s clothes are more expensive, I guess,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Who knows how far it&#39;ll get us, but yeah, she probably gave us &#39;enough.&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My sister&#39;s always complaining about that,&quot; Mike said. &quot;That, and pockets being a total joke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right. Guess we&#39;ll probably need purses.&quot; Jo frowned. &quot;Geez, I can&#39;t even remember when the last time I did any kind of deliberate wardrobe rebuild was. I feel like I&#39;ve basically been trading out T-shirts and jeans since I was a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, that&#39;s basically all I&#39;m gonna be doing now,&quot; Mike said, a little uncomfortably. He felt a bit weird at the thought of carrying a purse, but he remembered his sister&#39;s bitching well enough; he probably had no choice, didn&#39;t he...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Y&#39;think?&quot; Jo said, eyeing him curiously. &quot;Man, if you stick with black jeans and tees, you&#39;re gonna have kind of a low-key gothpunk chick look goin&#39; on. You could totally pull that off, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
He squirmed a little, not really wanting to think about what looks he could pull off. &quot;Well, aren&#39;t you gonna be doing the same thing? Like <i>either</i> of us knows anything about this stuff...&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrugged. &quot;I dunno, man. I&#39;m not exactly gonna be able to <i>hide</i> this; maybe I should just work with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike glanced back at her, and felt awkward again. No, she probably <i>couldn&#39;t</i> hide that; but the thought of embracing it still seemed...intimidating. He said nothing, and they drove on in relative silence.<br />
<br />
Eventually, they rolled into the parking lot of one of the generic department stores that littered the business district of the city. Mike felt a lot more self-conscious now that they were back out in the &quot;real world;&quot; it&#39;d been one thing for all the craziness to happen in a secretive science lab, that was the right place for it, but now here they were in a normal place, around normal people, being all...<i>different...</i><br />
<br />
Not that anybody else knew about that, of course; it felt like he was keeping a secret, only the secret was himself. He felt like they were all staring at him, whether or not they <i>were,</i> and hoped that getting into some clothes that fit properly would draw less attention. Then he frowned and squirmed. &quot;Shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jo cocked an eyebrow. &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
He groaned, and felt weird about how different it sounded in his altered voice. &quot;I gotta hit the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded. &quot;Want I should come with you, &#39;Chelle?&quot;<br />
<br />
He blinked. &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Chelle. Michelle. Shelly. Y&#39;know, the name you picked?&quot; She put a finger to her lip. &quot;I guess I could go by &#39;Jo-Jo,&#39; come think...&quot;<br />
<br />
He got a strange feeling in his chest at that; it was one thing to put it on a stack of paperwork, but actually being addressed that way, out in public, was a whole different ballgame. &quot;...Why would you do that?&quot; he asked, trying not to think about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Jo shrugged. &quot;Apparently women do that, or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t need any help using the <i>can,</i> thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; she laughed. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go start scoping stuff out, then; lemme know if you need anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
They parted ways, and he made his way over to the bathrooms. He hesitated a moment before entering, wondering if he was really supposed to be there...but it beat risking an awkward encounter in the men&#39;s room, he supposed. He found a stall, shut the door...and hesitated again, feeling nervous about actually doing this. But biology wasn&#39;t going to wait for him to psyche himself up, and he reluctantly dropped his pants, sat down, and let nature take its course.<br />
<br />
In the grand scheme of things, it wasn&#39;t as weird as he&#39;d built it up to be in his head; as previously, it was a mildly gross inconvenience and a relief to be done with. But it took him a long minute to work up the nerve to touch himself so he could get on with the cleanup - and for a good few minutes afterward, she just sat there, staring down at the part of her that meant she wasn&#39;t a him anymore.</p>
