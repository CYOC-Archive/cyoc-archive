<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It is a wonder as to what thoughts made George suddenly want Rick as a friend? The humor of the sloppy licking wore off after just a few minutes as George's prey lost his joy.<br />
<br />
Rick started to have a strange feeling about his face and neck. Maybe the worst was his teeth ached just shortly after one of George's slurps had plastered Rick's open laughing mouth.<br />
<br />
Taking the course which George and others engineered for the Radical Thyroid, the formula took effect after entering a subject's internal cavaties. Thus it entered Rick's mouth while also beginning an infection of his skin due to the acidic nature of the bovine saliva.<br />
<br />
At any rate Rick was beginning to know the strange sensations of one being infected by a viral formula. Its granting new directives to the Thyroid gland spured on the effects of waves in changes no subject thus infected could stop.<br />
<br />
Suddenly like an infection called &quot;LockJaw&quot; Rick's teeth clamped tightly together making any cry for help near impossible. It was then as his lips began to swell, the upper lip and his own nostrils merging to form the basic shape of a bovine muzzel.<br />
<br />
This brought Rick's hands up to smear the slimed saliva off his aching face as he began to panic. Now with the hands directly coming in contact with the infectious saliva they too took to burn as if soaked in acid.<br />
<br />
Geroge pressed the flanks of his large body tighter to trap his wanted prey. As if a call to welcome Rick Geroge bellared soft Mooing sounds as he had a ringside seat to his second forced trans-shape of a human.<br />
<br />
Terror and panic was fast setting in on Rick as he felt the physical bloating of his face. His hands burned of the acrid saliva's effects but still he patted and touched about his face. Fear and worry was turned to a form of agonized panic when by chance he brushed a had over one growing furry bovine shaped ear.<br />
<br />
Pushing, twisting, turning, Rick was captive by the shear bulk of George's bovine self. The wild terror of his young self being made different against any willed desire was first of all the main drive to escape. Yet Rick was having an aluring feeling as if the touch of this bull's body somehow or for some reason brought comfort.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed seeming like hours to Rick as he fought for his freedom only to make the bodies own fear surge on the effects of the Formula.    <br />
<br />
Teeth clenched, fear of entrapment, the knowledge his ears and nose with lips were changing, Rick tries to scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;RERAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR !&quot; it comes out and echos the old mill's walls.<br />
<br />
A deep breath and another forced try to scream, &quot;MURRRAAHH......!&quot; it came out almost sounding like the soft lowing coming from the bull, George.<br />
<br />
Now Rick began to cry as his youth and inexperience with life and troubles like these which threatened his life and future. Even in this way his pained hands brushed the running tears and with the opened tear ducts he issued again the infection in yet another inner part of his body.<br />
<br />
Groanings and tried screams of fright and the painful agony the young man was feeling had him beating his fists against George's strong and solid big body. <br />
<br />
Now the burning made Rick's eyes tear and clench shut. The pain made his fears build till he was about ready to faint. Falling down between George's large body and the concrete corner he was pressed into Rick collapsed to a kneeling position.<br />
<br />
This brought the sight of George's massive sheath, his male bovine big balls, and to Rick a possible way of escape.<br />
<br />
Pained and burning fingers reached out in the sudden desire to make the bull move as Rich took a firm grip on George's hairy sheath. As if by twisting it Rick was of some hope that the Bull would find some discomfort and step away. If it worked, Rick would dart out and away, making a beeline for his car and home.<br />
<br />
No such luck as instead of George moving the wrenching of his sheath made the Bull get a stiffening erection. A pink filthy wrinkled shaft emerged the long hairs which grew out the end of his monsterous sheath. <br />
<br />
One of Rick's hands took a grip on the ugly shaft feeling the pulse of the animal and making it a sensual delight for George.<br />
<br />
Seeing he was only giving a lusty enjoyment to the animal which had him trapped Rick let loose the sheath and cock of the Bull. Then a thought, &quot;I might slip under him and get away!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wiggling his feet and legs to a straight out position Rick tried his best to lay out flat. Little by little it worked till he was spread out on the concrete floor, his feet and legs out the far side of George's massive lower body.<br />
<br />
Then as the strange aching head touched the concrete floor, Rick's hands and heels began to pull and press him under and out from under George.<br />
<br />
Even as this continued George's mind was still rambling over the physical touching he felt on his sheath and erect shaft. It was as Rick's head was on the Mill floor and eyes and nose centered faced at the strainingly erect bovine cock that George orgasumed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly shooting out the peaked end of the pink cock came squirts of white juicy cum and mixed in the unholy globs of George's most infectious semen.<br />
<br />
Flying out and into Rick's eyes, his partially opened mouth, welling into his now bovine shaped ears, and just covering his entire head in pints of horrid smelling yuck.<br />
<br />
The sudden surge and covering made Rick's movment freeze. Yet in a second longer he slipped past and out from under George. Spitting, bellowing an almost inhuman and very bovine mooings sound, Rick scrambled to his feet.<br />
<br />
Blinded for the moment by the rank semen in his eyes and the sticky white cum plastered all over his face and head he had to stop and wipe it with those now numb hands and strange feeling fingers.<br />
<br />
The delight in his freedom was evenly weighed by Rick's terror over the odd feelings and his changed face. A blurred look toward the Bull and Rick took off on a run toward his car and safety.<br />
<br />
Rick had not taken five steps before he found himself urged to try and run on all fours rather than upright. So by the time he made it to the open door of the Mill he was travelling on hands and toes.<br />
<br />
Bending his head up to look for his car, Rick seeing the vehicle out in the weed infested parking lot he headed that direction.<br />
<br />
The sense of freedom and with the run brought on a strange sense of smell. The welcoming scent of the green weeds and grasses growing out the crack in pavement was bring on a urged desire to stop and maybe eat.<br />
<br />
Even before Rick had his accident, before he entered the Mill, he had been thinking of going home for something to eat. Now the infection, the Formula, and Rick's physical changes were making him desire food from a bovine pattern of thought.<br />
<br />
Not fifty feet from his car and the safety he had longed for, Rick stopped and with a wonderous release of his jaw and mouth he took a bite.<br />
<br />
The sour taste of this tall green weed was enough to shock Rick's mind back to thinking like a Boy. Yet too the urges to eat and eat more welled hard at him so as he walked on all fours toward his car he had to try this bite and that plant.<br />
<br />
Somewhere he lost it, Rick lost any and all control as he found a patch of sweet Kentucky Blue Grass. This sweet treasure enjoyed by race horses for years its aluring taste bade Rick to stand and eat.<br />
<br />
George by that time had wandered out to the late afternoon sun to also enjoy some taste sensations growing about the parking lot.<br />
<br />
Rick, his thoughts and desires made the transition to bovine as his head changed in physcial form to that of a Hereford specied bovine. Ears flopped about, as teeth and lips gathered greens for chewing. The white hairs of his new Hereford breed covered a heavy boned head. The white hairs sprouted Rick's chest, and reddish hair began to cover the shoulders and run down his spine.<br />
<br />
Little notice did the transforming boy give to the rips and tearing of his shirt, pants and the underwear as his body took to growing.<br />
<br />
George would raise his head to check on his soon to be companion only to return to grazing his number one tummy to a fullness.<br />
<br />
Rick wandered about as the one and only thought, to eat and graze himself content was the prime bovine directive. The formula had infected every part of his body due to the fear he felt when trapped. Now he was hairy, his muscles bulged like those of a young bovine bull calf. <br />
<br />
Swinging a tail brought new joy to the young bovine and he toyed with it and his very mobile ears. As he gorged his belly with the bounty of what the parking lot could offer the changes continued at a high rate.<br />
<br />
It was later when Rick's parents called the Sheriff's office reporting their missing son. An A.P.B. was put out over the radio to look for Rick's license number and his black Olds 442 two door car.</p>
