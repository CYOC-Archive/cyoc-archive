Jen woke up feeling a little groggy today. Moving around a bit she realized her sheets were damp. After school on Friday she started masturbating while watching a new romantic movie that came out which wasn&#39;t like her at all. Things only got worse on Saturday. She went out with her friends for coffee in the morning but actually had to cancel their night plans because she lost track of time masturbating and didn&#39;t have enough time to get ready. <br />
After rubbing her eyes a little bit, it hit her. A whole new set of memories flowed in her. After hitting puberty, she started spending a lot of time in the bath masturbating. Her parents initially choked it up to her enjoying baths but they soon realized the truth when they started hearing the sounds that came from inside as they were about to knock to see if she was okay. Her school life was also a bit different. She was still a cheerleader but due to her private sessions she didn&#39;t have the time to become skilled enough to be the head cheerleader or popular enough to be the head of her group of friends.<br />
Jen got really scared as she remembered how things used to be and how they changed and wanted to figure out how to turn everything back to normal. Unfortunately the fact that she didn&#39;t do her morning daily &#39;ritual&#39; that she had always done since she was 12  in this timeline made it hard to think. Eventually, she gave up and started masturbating to calm herself. She got a lot better at hiding it than when she was younger and although it was still hard to contain her voice, a pillow and some willpower were enough to reduce it to a level where it wasn&#39;t easy to be heard through the door. <br />
Despite the new memories telling her it was unneeded, she decided to put on a porno to get herself in the mood. She put on the headphones and started slowly running her finger up and down her vagina with one hand while searching for a good clip with the other one. However, after sensing her wetness minute later, she decided to put on a random one with good rating instead. Having both hands to herself, she leaned on the head of the bed and started rubbing her nipple with one hand, frigging herself with the other, and having a pillow in between her teeth. Not even 3 minutes later she started lightly spasming  as an orgasm shot through her.<br />
Having calmed down a bit, she cleaned up and went on the internet to try and come up with an explanation for what was happening. A little while later she heard a knock on the door<br />
&quot;Jen, are you up yet? There&#39;s breakfast downstairs.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t want any. Not hungry, I&#39;m busy. Go away&quot; Which was a lie since she was used to eating something every morning, especially after being drained from her &#39;activities&#39;. She just didn&#39;t want to stop researching for that long<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes, damn it, piss off already&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, then&quot;<br />
After a couple more hours of fruitless searching, Jennifer closed her laptop exasperatedly and started blowing off some steam.<br />
&quot;Damn four-eyes can&#39;t even figure out anything. If it was up to me they&#39;d all be homeless right now. They are all useless.&quot;<br />
She watch tv for a bit, had lunch and exercised a little and then coming home got ready to have a shower. It was already afternoon and she figured it was a good time to squeeze in another orgasm. <br />
She started going at it in the tub whilst thinking of the captain of the football team only to feel her vexations grow. She was at it for a full 10 minutes and while her body was writhing and her pussy was contracting as if it was cumming, her orgasm still didn&#39;t come for some reason. After getting even more frustrated, she put a finger in her ass. Lights flickered in her brain. She put in another finger inside and started frigging herself roughly. At this point she could feel the orgasm just a step away but she still couldn&#39;t quite reach it. Then, suddenly, she stood up, wrapped herself in a towel, loosely placed another on her head and ran to her room as far as she could. She fumbled around in one of her drawers until she found what she was looking for. A 7 inch pink vibrator that she immediately turned on and shoved in her pussy. A few more thrusts only served to aggravate her condition, before she pulled it out, thought for a second, and slowly put it in the opening of her rear entrance. The moment she put it in she started seeing spots as an orgasm she felt she was holding forever erupted. The vibrator kept stimulating her until finally a contraction pushed it out of her.<br />
She sat in her juices in bliss enjoying the afterglow for a few seconds before a knock on her door from Martha forced her to talk again<br />
&quot;Every(heavy breathing)thing&#39;s fine. I just... uhmm (heavy breathing) I was just exercising (heavy breathing) and stabbed my toe (heavy breathing) a little&quot; Jen said in an obvious lie. <br />
Even though she knew about Jens&#39;... high libido, Martha still decided to ask if she needed anything since she figured she might have hurt herself during her... activities. &quot;Do you need me to bring you anything? A gauze or something?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, it (heavy breathing) actually didn&#39;t (heavy breathing) pierce the skin. (heavy breathing) I was just a bit surprised is all.&quot;<br />
The day kept going with a rather awkward dinner and Jennifer talking with her friends on the phone for a couple of hours before going to sleep.<br />
