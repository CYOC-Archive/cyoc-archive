<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff decided to use the chronovac to make everyone gay.  He entered the changes, and when he was done, so was the Chronovac.  The entire world had turned into gay men.<br />
<br />
The sex was the hottest ever.  Everyone could fuck everyone whenever they wanted, and since there were only dudes now, everything went.  There was no restraint, only sex, sex and more sex.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before new diseases sprang up from all the casual sex.  It just goes to show that you can&#39;t do something as intimate as sharing body fluids in places the body was never designed to, without something going awry.  So the population dialed it back some in response, being a little more careful and a little more selective.<br />
<br />
Everyone was addicted to sex and working out, looking as hot and sexy as possible.  The guys were hotter than ever too, it was true.  It was an amazing life, and there was no doubt about it - people were happy in this new sexual male society.<br />
<br />
But eventually, guys started feeling unsatisfied.  They tried having more intense sex - getting into riskier behavior.  More extreme behavior seemed to be required for them to get off and have that sexual high.  The more time passed, the more it took to match the sexual highs from when this all started.  It became harder and harder to get hard.  And people started noticing they just didn&#39;t feel as happy and care-free as they felt at the beginning.<br />
<br />
Without a point of reference (since all females were wiped out - or more accurately replaced by male versions of themselves), they intuitively knew something was missing but couldn&#39;t put their finger on it.<br />
<br />
Then one day a guy was in the library, looking at actual books, made out of actual paper.  He found a lot of books on a subject that mystified him.  Something called a &quot;female&quot; and talk of &quot;gender&quot;.  Notions of sexuality other than that which existed today.  He had no way of knowing, but this library had been protected by a power beyond the Chronovac, so all the contents within had been protected from the change.  When people left the building after that change, the Chronovac immediately changed them.  But the books had stayed inside, and so were unchanged.<br />
<br />
Apparently, sexuality had always been very complex.  These books talked about something called &quot;heterosexuality&quot; - sexual inercourse between a man and a woman, in which the desired outcome of something called a &quot;family&quot; was to reproduce - to have something called a &quot;child.&quot;  Since the change, there were no women, and the children eventually grew up.  So while the population had been steadily shrinking, the human race going from nearly 8 billion lives down to 1 billion in the ensuing years, the old ideas of sex became lost to most people.<br />
<br />
Homosexual was the only sexuality that anyone knew or dreampt of at all.  So it was very strange when Clay discovered books talking about women, and children, and reproduction.  And even more bizarre when he read that heterosexuality was once the vastly predominant norm, resulting in smaller people coming out of adult people, who would then in turn grow into adults.  It did explain the dwindling population, though, and validated the rumors of something called a &quot;chronovac&quot; being used to turn everyone into gay men.  Clay thought that was just some kind of myth.  But when he thought about it, he couldn&#39;t come up with a better solution for where people came from.  So like most people, he didn&#39;t think about it.<br />
<br />
But the longing deep inside had grown almost intolerable.  And as Clay read more and more of the books, it awakened a curiousity to know more within him.  What he was reading made sense, and he just knew in his gut that it was true.  There had been a population of not just men, but these strange and different women too.  They had children together, and as families raised the children and passed on knowledge about all things - how to live, how to treat one another, how to function in a society and make a living.  So much of that had been lost in the brave new world.<br />
<br />
In fact, Clay found it strange to discover that Homosexuality at one time considered abnormal and was in a vast minority.  There were religious people who outlawwed it.  There were scientists who argued against it.  Well, Clay thought, if the species has to go on, that made sense from a scientific point of view.  He didn&#39;t really understand the religious stuff, so just shrugged at it.<br />
<br />
As he read, he learned that homosexuals were often ridiculed, attacked, and even killed by society.  Even the religious ones, which seemed so ironic to Clay, becuase the best he could tell was that religion had something to do with love and morality and treating people as you want to be treated - he couldn&#39;t imagine anyone wanting to be ridiculed, attacked, or even killed.  How was that loving?<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, the status of homosexuality went from being considered an abberition of the mind to becoming considered a normal and healthy different way of being.  Strange becuase, as far as Clay could see, there was absolutely no science behind it at all - it seemed to be a choice made purely randomly because homosexuality had become more popular or accepted at the time.  Stranger and stranger, people who talk about love hating those different than them, and people &quot;changing the rules of science&quot; not based on science at all but on popular opinion.  But then, popular opinion had always prevailed, whether it was for better or worse.<br />
<br />
Clay read about females, and their traditional role in this thing called the &quot;family&quot; - and how communities revolved around these families.  People loved one another - it wasn&#39;t just sex - there was so much more to it than getting off.  Sure, one could call getting off love.  But Clay knew that real caring wasn&#39;t the same as sex.  Just becuase he felt warm tingly feelings for someone who looked or acted a certain way, didn&#39;t mean he loved them.  And just because he loved someone didn&#39;t mean he wanted to have sex with them.<br />
<br />
Stranger and stranger.  Women where the heart of the family, but yet they were treated &quot;less than&quot; by some men.  Then women wanted to be more like men, and wanted to take more masculine roles.  And as society changed, men and women  did too.  Men became more feminine, women became more masculine.  There were many nuances and complexities, but the thing that stuck out to Clay the most was how oxymoronical it all was.  Everyone deserved respect, yet everyone ended up wanting to be something other than they were because then maybe people would treat them more fairly.  But now in a world full of men, the very core of men were screaming for the unknown feminine.  Humanity was incomplete and dying because someone decided it would be a good idea to make everyone gay.<br />
<br />
But it had started long before that.  The human race was a messy one.  Irrational, proud, arrogant, and with the power of the Chronovax, right down dangerous.<br />
<br />
It was in that moment of realization that a large armada of Alien ships arrived on Earth.  They quickly came to the truth of the matter, and decided that humanity had had it&#39;s chance and royally fucked itself.  The aliens left a warning not to go to the planet Earth as it was populated by a race of morons, and left humanity to die out.  They took Clay with them, he was displayed in a museum of natural history&#39;s biggest disappointments, where he got to live his life out reading all about humanity&#39;s past.<br />
<br />
His dying thoughts were how he wished he had had a chance to live in the heterosexual world, to discover what family and community were, and to reproduce and have chilren with a woman.  Naturally, had any other humans been alive and heard these thoughts, they would have shaken their heads in disapproval and called Clay a deviant freak... not that it would mean much considering the human race literally killed itself pursuing sexual gratification over any sense of community, love and functionality - such ideas weren&#39;t sexy.</p>
