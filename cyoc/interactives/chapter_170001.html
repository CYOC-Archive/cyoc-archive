<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hold on a minute. Let me step out for a bit so you can dry off in private at least&quot; insisted Kat, happy for an excuse to leave the room. She had to call their mother before things got any worse. After entering her room, Kat locked the door behind her and called her Mother&#39;s cell. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mommy, what is the earliest that can you get back home by?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why did something happen? Are you both ok?&quot; <br />
&quot;Something really bad has happened to Dan and I don&#39;t know how to fix it. And while I do not think he is in any immediate risk to his health, it is a pretty extreme issue. Also on a completely unrelated note, do we have any charm remover left?&quot;<br />
&quot;Check in the top drawer of my dresser, on the left. I can be there in as little as 10 seconds. Just make sure the circle is cleared off for me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I already cleared it yesterday.&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll meet you down stairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat hung up and ran to her parent&#39;s bed room. She easily found the bottle of charm remover and put a single drop into her mouth, clearing her backfired charm curse, as well as allowing her cock to be merged back into her body once again. Now charm free, she ran down stairs to get her mother who had just warped back home. <br />
&quot;Where is he.&quot; <br />
&quot;Upstairs in his bathroom. But please do not threaten him whatso ever. He could become very dangerous. If the wrong words are used. Especially if you talk about fixing him!&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright. You can come with me, but stay behind me if he is that dangerous.&quot; <br />
<br />
The both of them cautiously made their way towards Dan&#39;s bathroom. &quot;Kat, there is some incredible magical energy inside the bathroom. If I think it is too much and that I may not be enough to fix this by myself, you are to leave me here and go  summon your grandma to help, understood?&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand, but I doubt it will come to that if we are careful about what we say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now at the door, their mother begins to open it when a thought poos into her head. &quot;Kat, you keep saying that I need to be careful if my words, why?&quot; She askes as the door is opened, revealing a naked Danielle watching over a sleeping Yuna while keeping warm in the bath. <br />
&quot;Its because, she is overly protective around Yuna.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their mother just stared at Danielle with her mouth open. Danielle, who now also looked back towards her, began telling her to be more quiet as she didn&#39;t want to disturb Yuna&#39;s sleep. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, is that really you Dan?&quot; She whispered, taking head of the lamia&#39;s warning. This was answered by Danielle nodding gently. &quot;And... is that um, also yours?&quot; This time Danielle turned towards her mother and slowly brought herself and Yuna over to show her, all while grinning with joy. Kat then leaned over ans whispered into her mother&#39;s ear &quot;Dan calls herself Danielle now, and the baby lamia is called Yuna. And yes she did give birth to it. Somehow one of my spells didn&#39;t work properly for some unknown reason, and instead of making dan pregnant with an egg filled with my cum, he was actually somehow impregnated with a lamia egg.&quot; <br />
&quot;You can explain the details later, go call over your grandma, I can&#39;t even figure out where to begin wirh fixing this.&quot;<br />
With that, Kat left the room, leaving the 3 of them behind. <br />
<br />
The 2 of them just looked at each other for a long time, with both regularly glancing down at Yuna. Their mother now was at a loss. The situation had become incredibly difficult for her. As a mother herself. She basically already knew it was pointless to try and convince her new daughter to return back to being her son. The smile she had shown her had said everything. Now her struggle was with accepting the fact that she now was a grandmother of a magical being who far surpassed her in terms of magical potential. If her son had learned even the slightest bit about magic before becomming a lamia, then she would be completely hopless for the return her son. But he had never learned anything at all. So she had a sliver of a chance to break the transformation and reset his mind to how it was the day before today. But only if her own mother helped her as she was not powerful enough alone. <br />
<br />
But did she even want to do it? The thought of accepting everything how it is had also crossed her mind. It wasn&#39;t like her son was no longer in there. As far as she could tell, he was still mentally sound. Not a single form of manipulative magic was at play here. &quot;Are you doing ok&quot; she finally whispered. <br />
&quot;I am, and thank you mom, for your concern and all. I would like to introduce you to my daughter, Yuna. That is, if it is alright with you of course, and if you would like to meet her.&quot; Danielle had responed to her question in an unexpectedly formal manner. <br />
&quot;If it is alright&quot; was all she could bring herself to say. This seemed to make Danielle very happy though, so she figured it was the right choice.<br />
&quot;Yuna sweetie, look who has come to see you.&quot; Whispered Danielle softly as she gently stroked Yuna&#39;s hair, waking her. The lamia baby sleepily got herself up and slowly climbed up onto her mother&#39;s head again, this time just laying down on top of her looking forward. &quot;This is your grandma&quot; introduced Danielle. The lamia baby smiled after hearing that and slightly extended her tail out towards you. Danielle then grabs ahold your arm and slowly helps Yuna transfer over to your body, as her tail coils around your forearm. The pressure was tight, but not too uncomfortable. Now that you looked at her closly, she was actually a really cute baby. That was until she made a lunge for your exposed upper arm in an attempt to bite it. However she was easily stoped by her mother&#39;s finger which now filled her mouth. &quot;Yuna. No one but me, understand?&quot; The baby lamia no longer made any attempt to bite you and slowly transfered back over to Danielle&#39;s body, where she curled up on top of her upper most cleavage as Danielle wrapped herself in a towel. Yuna was now just watching you out of curiosity. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about that, mom.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
&quot;She did that to likely turn you into another lamia like me. But she is a good girl, and won&#39;t do it again, right?&quot;<br />
Yuna nods cutely at this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you certain about doing all this? Being a lamia&#39;s mother I mean.&quot;<br />
&quot;I will do this.&quot;<br />
&quot;But are you fine with it is what I am asking. I know you are her mother, but you were also forced into this role without your own consideration taken into account. Furthermore, you will be a woman for the rest of your life if you go through with this. And there is one other thing you may be overlooking, but if you choose this life. I will be forced to kill your human version off to avoid suspicion, and you will never be able to return to normal human society as a lamia. In fact, I don&#39;t really know where you could even go. While lamia are considered members of the magical society, they as a species, choose to work only, lets say, adult jobs, such as being escorts or actresses in adult films, or even work in brothels. The only other work places you commonly see them work in are as either maids or wet nurses. Are you sure you still want this life?&quot;<br />
&quot;Am I allowed to work other places, or is there some kind of law preventing me from doing so?&quot;<br />
&quot;There isn&#39;t any kind if hard restriction per say, but most lamia&#39;s do carry a certain stigma in the eyes of the general public.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then thats how it will be. I won&#39;t change my mind for anything. I am Danielle, a lamia, who also is the mother to a wonderful daughter. That is me. That is who I see myself as being 50 years from now. Even if I have to leave human society, live alone, and become the star of an adult video, I will gladly do it if it means I can keep being this girl&#39;s mother.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nope, I won&#39;t have it.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care, I will do it still. I will be Yuna&#39;s mother.&quot;<br />
&quot;I mean, I will not have any if my daughters working as an adult video&#39;s star actress. I know a few people who may be able to pull some strings for you, so let me handle finding you work once you and Yuna are ready for it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Also please don&#39;t be too hard on Kat. I&#39;m aware that it is odd comming from me, but if not for her, I wouldn&#39;t have become a mother.&quot;<br />
&quot;She isn&#39;t completely off the hook, but I will keep it in mind.&quot;</p>
