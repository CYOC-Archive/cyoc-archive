<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Rebecca Chan couldn't believe it. First
one of her students brought in what turned
out to be a real magic lamp, then the
genie that had been summoned had made her
a fairy, then Principal Norwood had been
turned into a satyr, then she had been
shrunk down to no more than three inches
tall, and now her boss and the genie were
shagging in the school, which was
otherwise empty because it had suddenly
become a school holiday.</p>
<p>And to top it all off, she couldn't get
inside to <i>do</i> anything about it;
when the genie had shoved her out the
window, some kind of for e field had gone
up, preventing her from re-entering. But
she couldn't just do nothing! This genie
clearly had no restrictions and was happy
to go about willy-nilly, transforming
people who didn't want it and didn't
deserve it. She to do <i>something,</i>
but what?</p>
<p>She had a thought, and she somehow knew
she could do it. Somehow, in the change,
she had become aware of the existence of
Fairyland. Non-fairies who went there, she
knew, could never return to the human
world. She had enough power to move the
school to Fairyland; she didn't like the
idea of Principal Norwood being stuck
there, and she liked the idea of being
stuck like this with no means to change
back even less, but that genie was just
too dangerous to be running loose, and
after all, the principal had gone along
with the genie's seduction.</p>
<p>Wishing she had the time to look for
another way, Rebecca focused her thoughts
into her wand. In the blink of an eye, the
school building had vanished, the
playground equipment and other facilities
scattered around the edge of a lawn of
lush green grass.</p>
<p>But what about her? Rebecca knew,
somehow, that it wasn't in her power to
change herself back into a human, and even
if she could, she'd just teleported her
workplace into another world altogether.
Was she going to be stuck as a fairy for
the rest of her life? It sure looked that
way.</p>
<p>Flitting a story or two above street
level, Rebecca slowly made her way home,
feeling rather depressed about the
situation she was in. She was soaring over
a back alley when she heard a cat yowling
in pain. Dropping down to street level she
saw a teenage boy grinning maliciously as
he threw objects at the poor cat. Rebecca
was filled with righteous anger, and
almost before she knew what was happening,
she had stretched out her wand towards the
jerk and hit him with a blast of fairy
magic.</p>
<p>The boy didn't notice, and continued to
laugh until his ears began to change. By
the time he had noticed, they had moved to
the top of his head, becoming thin,
triangular cat's ears, covered in calico
fur. He was visibly shocked as he reached
up a hand to feel what had happened, but
what really surprised him was when the
hand came down also covered in fur up to
the elbow, padded on the palm and
fingertips, and tipped with retractable
claws in place of fingernails.</p>
<p>"Oh my <i>God,</i>" he shrieked,
"what's <i>happening</i> to me!?" He
didn't notice that his canine teeth had
elongated into proper fangs, or that his
tongue had become a bit thinner and
rougher, but he'd find that out
eventually. Besides, the more surprising
change was in his feet, which he
discovered when he lifted one foot only to
have shoe fall completely off. It no
longer stayed on because his feet had
changed from human feet into full-fledged
cat's paws, also covered in fur up to the
knee.</p>
<p>He caught on enough to figure out what
was next, and a four-foot tail shot out
from his spine mere moments after he had
pulled his pants down. He sighed and began
to survey himself, realizing that the
changes were over.</p>
<p>Except they weren't. As he stared down
at his changed body, hair dropped into his
field of view. But where his hair was
black and coarse, this was fine, silky,
and the same golden-tan as patches of his
new fur. "What the hell?" he muttered, but
suddenly noticed that his voice had
changed to something much higher and
softer, almost...girlish?</p>
<p>"Oh, no," he moaned, watching his body
become softer and curvier, "no, I
can't...I don't <i>want</i> to be a girl!"
He began to panick in earnest as smallish
breasts began to grow on his chest, his
legs becoming longer and his face more
feminine. He let out a scream of terror as
his penis and testicles shrank back into
his body, becoming a vagina, uterus, and
ovaries. By the time her clothing reshaped
itself into a blouse, bra, skirt, and
panties, she was sitting in the alley,
crying.</p>
<p>Rebecca surveyed her handiwork. It
would be hard for this kid, but she had
earned it, and the support Rebecca knew
she would get from her family would help a
lot in her adjusting. As for Rebecca, she
suddenly knew what it was she was supposed
to do. A newfound part of her personality
was settling in place. No longer Rebecca
Chan, elementary-school teacher, she was
Becky the Transformation Fairy, existing
to transform those who had earned it,
whether by their good deeds or their bad
deeds. The old Rebecca was still there as
well, but she saw this as an opportunity
to teach the kind of lessons she hadn't
been allowed to as a teacher. With the new
and the old in agreement, Becky flitted
off gleefully in search of someone else
deserving of a transformation.</p></p>
