<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric stumbled through the crowds, trying his best to get away from the office building. His head was starting to swim and it was getting hotter. He pulled at his shirt, tempted to take it off but wouldn't. The young black man had seen what that other guy take his clothes off, and the changes it seemed to cause. <br />
<br />
He started noticing strange smells coming from the people around him. Some of them sweet and enticing, others rather sharp and bitter. He stumbled down the stairs to the subway, swiping his pass and leaned against a support pillar. It was at this time that he realised that the different smells were coming from the different genders around him. As a construction worker passed him the smell of sweet masculinity cause him to shudder in delight, but when a women in tight shorts and a skimpy top walked by he almost cringed at the smell. He couldn't place it, but something about her just smelled wrong, and it freaked him out. He shook his head, trying to clear the fog that was creeping into it. Through it he kept thinking about the guys around him, and what he could do with them, but would quickly snap himself out of it. When the train rolled into the station he quickly boarded and tried to get as far in as possible, as to avoid contact with anyone in fear of what he might not be able to help himself from doing.<br />
<br />
Unfortunalty the people kept pouring in, making it impossible not to be pressed up against someone. He looked into the crowd and noticed that the construction worker he had smelled earlier was heading towards him and he gulped. The guy was obviously looking at him and worked his way so he was standing right beside Eric. The heat of the train and from the large body beside him was causing him to sweat. He couldn't help but look at the guy out the corner of his eye who thankfully was standing with his back to the frantic mail-room worker. He was tall and muscular, and didn't have that beer belly most of the men in his occupation had. When the train rumbled and began to move Eric was pressed up against the guys back, the crowd swaying back and forth just enough to almost keep him there. He thought he heard the guy chuckle. <br />
<br />
At the next stop several people around the two got off and Eric thought he wouldn't have to stand so close to the guy again. But this wasn't to be as even more people got on. The guy turned a bit to let an elderly women sit down on the bench behind them, turning jsut enough so that Eric's back was pressed against his front with the crowd of people. The black youth shuddered as he felt that weight press against him. And the movement of the train didn't help any. At the next stop, only a few people got off, but the motion of stopping pushed him into the contrustion worker and this time he stayed there, feeling a large bluge pushing into him this time. Eric couldn't stop himself from grinding into it a bit, it felt to good not to.<br />
<br />
A large hand rested on his shoulder and he looked up into the guys smile. Eric blushed and looked back down, feeling himself start to get hard as well, alogn with a few other things like his shoes starting to feel tight and the faintest of itches on his legs. When they pulled into the next station he was led out and towards the restrooms. Once inside he was led into the largest stall and turned around. Eric pressed himself against the wall as the large man towered over him. He smiled weakly looking up into the mans eyes, which were soft and gently but full of passion. From the expression on his face Eric was sure that hte guy would have let him go if he said no, but he couldn't bring himself to do that. He wanted this.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... whats your name hot stuff?&quot; The big guy moved in closer, one hand on the wall behind Eric, the other moving down the black kids shirt, feeling the muscled behind which had become much more defined on the train ride.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.. um, Eric.&quot; He tilted his head up just enough to line himself up for a kiss, a strange feeling on his temples. &quot;And, yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ron.&quot; The guy moved in and kissed Eric, their tongues wrestling in their mouths. Ron moved his hand down to undo Eric's belt and jeans, the younger mans boxers springing out into a tent which was tenderly rubbed.<br />
<br />
It wasn't long before Eric was stripped of his pants and Ron was rubbing his cock in the black crevice. A condom and lube produced from his lunchbox wrapped around his large tool as he humped gently. Eric was moaning in pleasure and had already given in to the lust taking over his mind. His ears had already started to lengthen and he could feel the call of the satyrs back at the office. He would have to return to them, after he became one of them and welcomed Ron into their number. Their kiss had already sealed his fate, and the act they were about to commit would speed both of their changes. Eric called out in passion as Ron penetrated him and began to passionalty thrust in and out of him. The large man's beard thickening into a sharp goatee.</p>
