<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus walked into the bathroom and did the first thing he always did when he was in there. He locked the door on the opposite side which lead into his sister’s room. He knew his sister wasn’t there she was at her friend’s place, but it was a force of habit to limit the chance of someone walking in on him. The door could be unlocked easily enough from the outside, but it would prevent someone from opening it by accident. He then placed the cloths on the counter looked at himself in the mirror, Oliver was right he was covered in dust and grim. He moved a hand up to his face and whipped away some of it.<br />
<br />
“Damn…this is going to take longer then I thought.” Cursed Marcus as he turned around and turned on the shower, letting it warm up. As he did, he undress and threw a towel over the glass divider. Steam began to fill the tiny bathroom as he steps into the shower. The water was hot…extremely hot but he loved hot showers. <br />
<br />
He closed his eyes and let the water run down his body as the first layer of dirt and grim began to fall away. As the water did its work removing the dirt he failed to noticed his body hair falling away, they where washed away along with the dirt. He spun around to get his back, still not noticing what was happening. <br />
<br />
Marcus had never been a big man, he was just a hair short of 6 ft but now he shrank down, his whole body shrinking until it he was about the same height as his mother who was 5’5. He reached for his body wash to help and as he put the liquid into his now thinner hand the smell of flowers filled his noise. He smiled as he began to rub the shampoo into his hair. <br />
<br />
The liquid began it’s work to clean that up as his dark brown hair, something he got from his father began to lighten. It did not become a full blonde like his mother and sister had but a dirty blonde like her two aunts on her father side. His hair also grew until it touched his shoulder blades but it advanced no more than that. The water carried the shampoo down as his face began to change, his Addams apple disappeared as his whole frame shifted to a more feminine state. He still remained fit and strong but he was clearly not as well defined muscle was he had before. His legs and arms became thinner as red fingernail and toenail polish appeared on his feet and hands. He moved back a bit to clean his junk so the water could hit it straight on, he failed to noticed that with each passing moment his manhood got smaller and smaller until with a slight pop which he mistook for a popping muscle from an old volleyball injury his manhood was gone and replaced with her womanhood. <br />
<br />
The water did it is work as the dirt and grim disappeared down the drain. With that done she reached over and turned off the water before grabbing the towel to dry herself off. Her brain not even noticing the changes as she tied the towel around her still flat chest and stepped out. The vent had carried away much of the steam but the glass was still foggy as she grabbed her hair driver from the same spot where her electric beard trimmer had been before. She began to blow out her hair as her chest began to puff out as two nice B cup breasts began to fill out her new body. The mirror became clear, as it did and her transformation neared it’s end, she looked at herself in the mirror, before her was a women, a good looking athletic women, with a nice rack on her and a nice ass, not a 10 out of 10 for sure but a good 8 or 9. <br />
<br />
It was then that all the changes which had been hidden from Marcus’ knowledge suddenly became clear…he realized all the photos on the wall was of this women, the bra and panty set which still sat on the counter was this women’s, the bedroom was this women’s and worse of all he was this women. He had just become the female version of himself, he had just become Mariah.</p>
