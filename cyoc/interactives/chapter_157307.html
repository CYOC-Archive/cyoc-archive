<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Now for you two.” Said Lucifer as his hand began to glow with a black seal, a matching seal appeared on Mike’s chest. Mike tried to jump back but found he couldn’t, Jeff who had been standing beside Mike jumped back. Clearly Lucifer was planning to turn them one at a time, starting with Mike.<br />
<br />
“Please…st…” started Mike but it was too late. He tried to fight it but he knew he couldn’t, he closed his eyes only to feel a burning sensation and when he opened it, he began to notice things he had never before. He could also see much greater distance; he had no idea why. What he couldn’t have seen was that his eyes had turn from a brown to a deep purple. <br />
<br />
Standing beside him Jeff opened his mouth in horror as he watched the short buzz cut of his friend began to rapidly grow out turning purple as it did so. The hair even styled itself in a long ponytail with perfect bangs over the eyes. Then Mike’s face changed, it became rounded more feminine, the eyebrows became perfectly cut as they to turned purple, as did his lips. The coming down from the forehead and spreading like an unstoppable force, Mike’s already dark skin turned into a pitch black which made the purple stand out even more. <br />
<br />
Mike could feel, his hair brushing the small of his back, he could see the strains of purple hair which formed prefect bangs. Somehow, he knew that his hair was a pony tail which was held back with a bronze band. He had never seen it before, but he knew it and he knew why it was bronze. He felt his neck grow longer and felt something tight appear around his neck, he knew what it was too and while he still tried to fight it he also welcomed it.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched as a bronze collar appeared around his friend’s throat, it went halfway up his now much longer neck and went to a hard point which pointed straight down. He knew this because he watched as the T-shirt Mike had been wearing began to change. It first fell downward then it began to change into a corset which pushed his chest up. His entire frame was shrinking while he remained the same height.<br />
<br />
Mike could feel what was happening but it felt so good, his shoulders became bare as his shirt pulled down and began to form an armored corset which covered his chest. He didn’t know how he knew it was armored but it was, he could feel the weight of the armor and more so as his breast pushed out to fill the void that the armor provided. It felt so good as he fault down a moan as his breasts formed stopping at a large B cup or a small C, with his tight bronze and purple armor pushing them up they looked much bigger than they were. He looked down and smiled as his arms also thinned out but remained strong, maybe even stronger as long fingerless purple gloves which went all the way up to beyond his elbows appeared. On top of those gloves bronze plate formed, however the plate stopped at his hands, his finger nails became purple as well. Then he felt it, the most amazing thing as he stopped being a he and became a she.<br />
<br />
By this point she wasn’t fighting it anymore, she wanted it. No one could see it but she felt all her muscles grow in strength as a skirt formed, not a normal skirt but something more in kind with a Greek or roman armor. Her legs also changed becoming more graceful and long, even as his blue jeans turned into knee high boots with a modest high heel with armored fronts. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked on in horrified amazement as his friend turned into what he could best think of as a pitch black skin, purple haired Amazonian like woman. With sexualized Greek or roman armor. <br />
<br />
She was almost done; Mike knew as he felt weight on her hip as a sword belt appeared as well as large bronze shield with the symbol of the Princess of Hell appeared on it. Then with one last burst of transformation power, large purple wings popped out of her shoulder blades. These where not the bat like wings of most demons, because she wasn’t a demon. Her wings where a rich dark purple and they where feathered like a bird. She wasn’t a demon, the best words to describe her was a Dark or Fallen Valkyrie. <br />
<br />
She lowered her head as her eyes flashed purple. Then with grace she got down on one knee before the royal family of hell. <br />
<br />
“My Lord, thank you for this honor.” Said Mike in her new voice.<br />
<br />
“You will not only be my daughter’s friend, but you will be her guard, her shield and protect her from all harm.” Ordered Lucifer<br />
<br />
“I will do so, to the best of my abilities my lord.” Said Mike, as he touched the hilt of her sword. Somehow, she knew how to use it as if she had been doing it for years, but still she would need to train more so she will never fail to protect the Princess of Hell. She had been honored to be given the bronze armor, as the guard of the Princess she would wear bronze just like Lucifer main guard would be wearing golden armor while Lilith’s guard wore silver armored. <br />
<br />
“I know you will not fail us.” Said Lilith <br />
<br />
“So Mike what should we call you?” inquired Deonna formally the human dale.<br />
<br />
“Mica.” Said Mike<br />
<br />
“Not much of a change, but ok.” Said Deonna with a chuckle<br />
<br />
“It is what my human parents where going to call me if I was born a girl.” Explained Mica<br />
<br />
“Well you’re a woman now.” Stated Deonna with a laugh.<br />
<br />
“I am.” Confirmed Mica laughing with Deonna. “Your turn, Jeff.”</p>
