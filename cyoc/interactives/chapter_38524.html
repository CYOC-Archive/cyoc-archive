<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">'Ten thousand genies, is not a pretty sight to any being in creation.' This thought ran <br />
through many people's minds both inside and outsider Karthis City. With this threat made <br />
readily apparent, while it certainly was a bell of doom for Karther and his entire kingdom, <br />
it had one slight side effect of giving a slight better rep for the king of desert foxes. <br />
<br />
These weren't people raised on Hollywood or 'I Dream of Genie' these people knew how <br />
powerful djinn were, and how frighteningly dangerous they could be if they weren't <br />
restrained. So spieling a fantasy about djinn have come to destroy them all, and playing <br />
people's fears of the almost unknown from eons of the unknown hiding and not coming <br />
out to correct misconceptions, some people were finding the ideas of fur and tails in <br />
exchange for imaginary protection against the threat of ten thousand angry and wrathful <br />
genies to be a very good trade off. King Tamthis of course was very pleased by this turn of <br />
events. And with nearly all ignorant of Tamthis' previous raids, it worked perfectly. <br />
<br />
And as long as each person was searched for something that could contain a djinn, none <br />
of the foxes or wolves feared for an infiltration. The idea of a handful of angels coming in <br />
through the front gate didn't have time to be thought of, most were too busy checking out <br />
the sky and ground for any signs of ten thousand beings of unimaginable power. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Lisa, the wall flower, the follower like Erica, and the most likely to think before acting <br />
besides Viki. A beige furred fox angel with eyes that were pools of blood and whose ruby <br />
in her forehead resembled a tear.  <br />
<br />
Luna, the one who most dearly desired to see justice done. A pure white snow fox angel, <br />
her eyes the same sky blue as the gem in the center of her chest. <br />
<br />
Erica, eldest sister in terms of years lived. Luna's other half almost, silver fur, on her  <br />
forehead an oval amethyst that matched her eyes. <br />
<br />
Viki, eldest sister in terms of time of servitude to Karther. No gem was part of her body, <br />
her fur an ever shifting reflections of browns defying jaded opinions on the color. And <br />
those amber eyes, held a stronger hold than any of her siblings thought possible. <br />
<br />
For all four, it was time. <br />
<br />
Janice following Tabra's instructions called a knife into existence and cut their own arm, <br />
four drops of blood fell into the palm of their hand, forming into spheres and having just <br />
above their fur. Janice watched as Tabra focused their power into those drops of blood, <br />
giving those four red orbs their precise instructions. The four drops of blood became four <br />
points of light even as the injury that birthed them healed over, unlike any other injury <br />
they had received, this one left a scar. Tabra raised their palm to their face and Janice gave <br />
it a slight blow from her lungs.<br />
<br />
The red points of light entered via where each of their belly buttons would have been <br />
before. The red light spread through their nervous systems and into their brains and then <br />
spread through their spirits. There wasn't the pain of death and rebirth the vixen had felt <br />
in their ascensions.  Instead there was just intensity. Survival instinct allowed to grow even <br />
as it was carefully tempered by fellowship and caution. Luna embraced the feeling without <br />
hesitation. Erica knew she was far past the point of no return and simply thought 'no <br />
regrets.' Viki took it neither loving or hating it. Lisa felt fear, which Tabra would say made <br />
her the smartest of the new angels there. <br />
<br />
Muscles increased in size, but not absurdly so to where they'd hinder movement or ruin <br />
one's own control. The power within them was sharpened, reshaped, all for the purpose of <br />
protecting their comrades, and to create more effective killing tools. Foxes were not <br />
known for a pack mentality, but these angels felt a sense of unification between them that <br />
they knew could never be broken. Long hair already shortened to something more <br />
manageable in battle became sleek. Claws and teeth became more effective at their <br />
biological function, curved and harder. One word echoed in each of their minds: duty. <br />
Duty to each other. Duty to humanity. Duty to their stray sisters. Duty to their new race. <br />
And duty to their God. This was truth! <br />
<br />
Jasmine watched with low eyes but with a sense of harsh indifference. Keiko watched in <br />
awe. Akira, likewise watched in amazement. The two kitesune looked at each other to <br />
make sure they were seeing the same thing. Tabra refused to let his/Janice's eyes leave <br />
the sight of the transformation. This would be burned into their memory forever. <br />
Alexandra's eyes just wider, and wider, and wider. <br />
<br />
'Our turn then?' Janice asked. <br />
<br />
Tabra hugged their body, '-Only- if you want it. You say I've been selfish. You say I've just <br />
been trying to cover up my own worthlessness. The choice belongs to you Janice, I'll dump <br />
everything I have to keep the fusion between us from happening until you ask me <br />
differently Janice, I owe that much to you at the very least.' <br />
<br />
The four soldiers picked themselves up. They each gave Jasmine a nod of respect and <br />
acknowledgement as was to be expected for a senior angel. They stood in a row at <br />
attention, arms at their sides, wings folded, eyes and muzzles foreword, and tails even.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready Sir.&quot; Lisa said to the duel spirit angel fox. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just give the order.&quot; Luna added.<br />
<br />
&quot;All preparations complete.&quot; Erica declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prepared for operation!&quot; Viki said intensely.<br />
<br />
Alexandra's mouth looked like she was trying to catch flies. Keiko tabbed her on the <br />
shoulder to bring her back to reality. <br />
<br />
Tabra looked at the non-angels in the underground sand camber, &quot;Alexandra, Anna/Akira, <br />
until the fighting starts the ball is in your court.&quot; <br />
<br />
 Akira waved his tails and placed a leaf on his head and in a puff of smoke turned into a <br />
humanoid fox man wearing traditional arab gab complete with a turban with holes for his <br />
ears. &quot;Inari I can't believe I've spent of my life on only two legs... &quot; He took out a handful of <br />
leafs from wherever he got them and threw into the air where they turned into the <br />
traditional female garb for this part of the world. Meaning that it covered the body <br />
effectively head to toe, the only exception was a hole for the tail. There hadn't been time <br />
yet for anyone to figure the new limb's expose as taboo yet. &quot;Okay, there are people who <br />
are suckered rather than zomified who are going into Karthis right now, stop with that <br />
look Alexandra. Which means you guys need a male to escort all of you, just consider <br />
yourselves all my wives until we get into the front door, no I don't like the idea either, way <br />
too much commitment for my taste. I'll also be able to fast talk my way out of any little <br />
situations before they become big ones. After that, Alexandra you'll have to sublimely <br />
guide us to the palace, with all this stuff on no one should be able to recognize you at a <br />
glance. Hopefully the wolvens won't be trying to sniff you out. If they do, I have some <br />
magic tricks to throw them off, but they're rather disgusting and I'd rather not mention <br />
them if I don't need to. After the fighting starts, I think I'll just duck my head somewhere <br />
and hide, that goes double you for you Alexandra, leave it to the rest of us to....erm.... <br />
save... your dear prince.&quot;   Everyone felt uneasy about that last part.  &quot;Keiko, if everything <br />
goes wrong the genies need to 'lightning war' the place... either get in, get as many people <br />
out as you can, or go home and take care of my local for me...&quot; <br />
<br />
Alexandra nodded in response. 'We're coming back my prince.'  Jasmine crossed her arms <br />
indignantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;All troops ready?&quot; Janice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mam!&quot; They said together to their sister.</p>
