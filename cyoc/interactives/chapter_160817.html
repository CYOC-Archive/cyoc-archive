<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You both have heard what&#39;s happened in Dalint, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dalin… what now?&quot; Grandpapa replied, his drunkard nature clouding a good portion of his rationality; much to Arhian&#39;s frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dalint, grandpapa. You know, the place I just returned from? The Kingdom of Dalint? Where I&#39;ve been living the past three years?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, right, right m&#39;boy… sorry. Couldn&#39;t help myself to that leftover whiskey.&quot; The old man replied with a nod, although his eyes were anywhere but focused on his oldest grandson. &quot;Amier, when did there become two of ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alcohol is one hell of a beverage…&quot; Arhian&#39;s eyes closed with a sigh, the blonde youth opting to leave his elder to his drunkard haze as he turned to his pink-haired brother. He didn&#39;t anticipate the old man being so tipsy despite being fine only minutes ago. He&#39;d definitely been drinking before he&#39;d even arrived, and thus was left to deal with the symptoms. &quot;Okay, have <em>you</em> heard about it? I figure if it&#39;s not the adults, it&#39;s the kids who find out first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I… no? Did something happen over there?&quot; Amier replied worriedly, taking notice of the way his sibling&#39;s expression wavered. <br />
<br />
Although, it was difficult to actually discern with grandpapa&#39;s… hoarse breathing in the background and delirious mumbling. Perhaps it was more annoyance that plagued his brother instead? Maybe he should&#39;ve known better when buying a casket of whiskey… as if there wasn&#39;t enough stored away already.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh…&quot; Arhian groaned, rising from his seat; gaze dropping to his younger brother. &quot;Let&#39;s… go upstairs. We&#39;ll tell the drunkard about it tomorrow morning.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm… okay?&quot; Amier&#39;s brow furrowed in confusion as he rose to follow his brother.<br />
<br />
While the household was small and cramped, it was livable and had a second floor with two bedrooms; one where grandpapa slept and the other where Amier and his older brother would sleep. Of course, with the latter having moved away three years ago, it had mostly become Amier&#39;s room. Even so, Arhian knew the layout of their small home like the back of his hand. As if he had never left.<br />
<br />
In a blur and with the door shut tight behind them, the two brothers found themselves seated upon the bed that they once shared. The room itself was quite spacious, rays of light piercing through the single window that sat at one of the walls. The sky had been tinted a glorious shade of orange, the sun preparing to set and plunge the world into night.<br />
<br />
&quot;So…&quot; Amier began, his feet swinging idly off the side of the bed as he attempted to make himself comfortable. &quot;Is it… <em>bad</em> news? You don&#39;t look happy…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... not too sure myself. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s <em>bad</em> news, though.&quot; Arhian answered in vague uncertainty, his gaze examining the room that he had once shared. Only as he realized he was being waited upon did he shake the nostalgia from his eyes. &quot;But, it&#39;s important enough that I wanted to tell both you and grandpapa. I thought the news would&#39;ve already spread to Esbur, but I guess Norloc Village hasn&#39;t been briefed yet…?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay…?&quot; Amier questioned, unable to hide the confusion in his voice. &quot;Just get the point, Arhian. I don&#39;t like it when you ramble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arhian nodded, clearing his throat and turning to face his pink-clad brother in clarity.<br />
<br />
&quot;About five weeks ago, us knights were dispatched to a small backwater village in the Kingdom; not too different from Norloc really. We had gotten a request from a local archbishop to investigate reports of villagers falling into a sleep so deep it interfered with their day-to-day lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s… bad? Sleeping is nice, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Amier asked innocently, having momentarily forgotten the anxious expression plaguing his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Amier. It was… well, not anything we really expected.&quot; Arhian whispered, gaze breaking from his brother to fall to his lap. &quot;We arrived at the village around midday, and were greeted with… silence. Not a single soul outside to greet us. Hell, it seemed as if the entire village had become a ghost town. The messenger we sent to alert the villagers that we were close didn&#39;t come out to meet us either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amier felt a chill run down his spine at the description. If something like that were to happen here… if he were to wake up and find everyone gone…<br />
<br />
&quot;We barged into nearby homes hoping to find someone, <em>anyone</em>. And we did, we found villagers in their homes… asleep, drawn so deep into the realm of dreams we couldn&#39;t wake them…&quot; The blonde continued, his eyes drifting to the open window and sun beyond. &quot;The most spine chilling part about it all, was the presence of black runes across the dreamers skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Black… runes? Like magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Arhian whispered, shaking his head. &quot;We thought it was magic, but it was more like a sickness. A disease that draws one so deep into slumber that they are unable to be stirred, their bodies left to be eroded by time… it&#39;s been dubbed the Black Disease, although there are a few other names as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...&quot; Amier squinted as he gazed at his brother&#39;s face, leaning forward to catch his attention. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t want to tell me something like this if it couldn&#39;t be contained… <em>right</em>?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I <em>might</em> have been exaggerating just a bit. Just know that for now at least, Esbur hasn&#39;t had anything similar.&quot; Arhian reassured, a chuckle escaping his lips; as if forgetting his little brother was more perceptive than he seemed. &quot;It was an isolated case. So there&#39;s really no room to fret.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I… I guess.&quot; Amier said flatly, not entirely sure if his brother was correct. It seemed as if he himself was having a difficult time believing his words. &quot;So… was that it? I know Sylev was trying to bug me about something earlier… so, maybe…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Well, I suppose grandpapa didn&#39;t receive any news on it, but the rest of the village has. I&#39;ll make sure to tell him tomorrow when he&#39;s… not drunk.&quot; Arhian mused, leaning rather abruptly into the bed and giving a yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re… tired already? The sun&#39;s barely going down, and it hasn&#39;t even been an hour since you got here…&quot; The pink-clad boy pouted as he rose from the bed to give his sibling space, although he found an unusual ache in his chest with what he&#39;d just been told.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh… don&#39;t be crass, Amier. You know I had to come all the way from Selheino, right?&quot; The older boy huffed, shifting his position so he was laying upon the bed more comfortably. &quot;Besides… I&#39;m here now. And we&#39;ll have… all day tomorrow to do some good old brotherly bonding... yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah! You&#39;re right, I didn&#39;t mean to be so…&quot;<br />
<br />
Amier found his voice falling away, his ocean blue eyes so wide they may as well have fallen from their sockets.<br />
<br />
He wished they had.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-Arhian…?&quot; He choked, eyes glued upon the black letters crawling up his older brother&#39;s exposed neck. They were just as what he had described, runic patterns; a language he could not read.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arhian! Wake up!&quot; Amier cried, leaping onto the bed they once shared; his brother&#39;s eyes having closed seconds ago as he was lost to the Black Disease.<br />
<br />
A disease he barely knew about until mere moments ago. The runes had not ceased, blotting out the color of his brother&#39;s skin entirely; burning his hands as if they were brands.<br />
<br />
What if it was contagious?<br />
<br />
&quot;<em><b>ARHIAN</b></em>!&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
Amier didn&#39;t know how long he had been screaming and shaking Arhian&#39;s body before the door to his room slammed open, grandpapa&#39;s voice booming through the air.<br />
<br />
Unable to stop the stinging tears snaking down his cheeks, the pink-haired boy&#39;s gaze snapped to his only remaining family solemnly.</p>
