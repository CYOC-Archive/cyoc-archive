<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max is lying in his tent, thrashing around unable to fall asleep, “man, maybe choosing a nocturnal animal wasn’t such a great idea,” he mumbles to himself, “I don’t know how Eric managed to fall asleep, since Jaguars are also nocturnal.” The Mane Wolf-boy continues to try and fall asleep for a few more minutes, but soon he just gives up, “it’s no use,” he sighs, he looks over at his phone, “I could download the App, the others don’t need to know, I could have some fun with it.” Max takes his phone and opens the App store, he then soon finds the App and downloads it, soon the App is installed. He then decides to scan the others, just in case he decides to mess with them for fun, grinning to himself, Max activates the scan.<br />
<br />
After the scan is complete, Max raises an eyebrow and tilts his head when he notices a file labeled “Jeff”, “hu? Who’s “Jeff”, is someone near our camp,” he asks himself, “I haven’t seen anyone else around and there is no sign of a second camp.” His curiosity soon gets the better of him and he opens the file, Max’s eyes widen in surprise, “what the… the Jeep we have been working on is not really a Jeep… it’s… it’s Greg’s brother Jeff,” he asks himself in disbelieve, “why is he a Jeep? Did he willingly transform himself or did Greg transform him as a prank?”<br />
<br />
Max thinks if he should ask the Jeep… um Jeff… what has happened or if he should keep the information to himself, for now. The Mane Wolf-boy decides to keep it to himself for now, maybe he’ll ask the Jeep later, after scrolling through the App, checking out all the options and reading the manual, Max starts to get thirsty, “I need a drink,” he mumbles. He quietly, not to wake the others, opens his tent and crawls out, Max stretches like an animal without even noticing, before he gets up on his hind legs. First Max looks over at the table, on which a few bottles of water are still standing, but he then hears the nearby stream, without thinking he starts to walk towards the sound of the running water.<br />
<br />
The small stream is a few meters from the camp, when Max arrives, he lets himself fall onto his hands, the Mane Wolf-boy licks his lips at the sight of the clear water and he starts to lap greedily at it. Unaware to him, something nearby has picked up on his scent, and it was not happy.<br />
<br />
Not far from the stream a feral Mane Wolf is trotting through the jungle, on the search for something to hunt, when it stops in its tracks as a scent hits his nose, the animal sniffs the air and lets out a growl, ‘there is something in MY territory,’ it thinks to itself, ‘it smells… weird… it smells like a male Mane Wolf… but… has something alien about it, a second scent I can’t really place… it doesn’t smell… like an animal… smells almost… human.’ The Mane Wolf feels confused, on one side it wants to chase the intruder out of ITS territory, but on the other side, it is curious. The feral animal then decides to first investigate, so it slowly creeps closer towards the weird scent.<br />
<br />
When the feral Mane Wolf approaches the stream it crouches down behind a bush and stares through the leaves. There, by the edge of the stream, he sees what appears to be a normal Mane Wolf like him, drinking from HIS stream in HIS territory. A low growl escapes his throat, didn’t the other Mane Wolf realize his mistake? Well, he will soon learn his lesson, the feral Mane Wolf gets ready to attack, but then the figure starts to move, this causes the animal in the bushes to hesitate, suddenly the strange figure stands up on its hind legs?! The Mane Wolf almost lets out a yelp of surprise, ‘how…,’ it thinks to itself, it then narrows its eyes, ‘I got to know,’ with that it slowly moves out from behind the bush and lets out a growl, while taking on a defensive and aggressive pose, “what are you?! And what are you doing in MY territory,” the Mane Wolf growls.<br />
<br />
Max is about to head back to camp when he hears some rustling coming from the bushes, followed by a growl, strangely Max somehow is able to understand the meaning. He slowly turns around and lets out a gasp, taking a step back to just trip and fall onto his furry butt, when he spots the huge feral Mane Wolf slowly approaching him. Max is terrified, “pl-please,” he says, not noticing that it comes out in a whimper, “pl-please d-don’t hurt me! I… I d-didn’t know this is y-your territory.”<br />
<br />
The animal continues to slowly walk towards the weird creature, which looks terrified and continues to move away, its tail between its legs. Realizing that the weird creature seems to pose no threat, the feral Mane Wolf relaxes a little, he stops a few feet in front of Max, who also stops backing away as he notices that the feral animal is not seeming to come closer.<br />
<br />
Both stare at each other in silence, Max is unsure what to do, should he run or should he stay putt.<br />
<br />
The feral Mane Wolf seems to sense Max’s thoughts, “I wouldn’t think of moving an inch, if I were you,” it growls.<br />
<br />
Max gulps, “pl-please,” he whimpers, fear in his eyes and voice, “I s-said I’m s-sorry… pl-please… just… just let me g-go! I promise… I’ll not return!”<br />
<br />
“SILENCE,” the feral barks, Max lets out a whimper but obeys, the feral Wolf takes a deep breath, “listen, I may be agitated by you being in my territory, but… my curiousity is much stronger. I want to know what you are! You smell like a Mane Wolf… but… you don’t seem to be a normal Mane Wolf… your scent is weird.” The animal looks at Max, narrowing its eyes, “so, if you don’t want me to hurt you,” it says, “you better start explaining.”<br />
<br />
“I… I’m not really a Mane Wolf,” Max says, deciding it would be better to do as told and explain the situation to the wild animal in front of him.<br />
<br />
The feral Mane Wolf tilts his head, its eyes still narrowed, “what do you mean,” it asks.<br />
<br />
“I… I’m actually a… hu-human,” Max says, “I… I got trans-transformed into a… hybrid.”<br />
<br />
The feral looks confused, “transformed?”<br />
<br />
Max nods, he then tells the animal the whole story, “so… th-that is why I’m like this and why I didn’t know I stumbled into your territory,” he finishes.<br />
<br />
The feral Mane Wolf has his head tilted, “so, let me get this straight,” it says, “you and your friends decided to go camping. Arriving here your friend… Greg was it? Asked if it would be fun to become hybrids of animals which reside in this jungle. Dean is some kind of bird, Greg a lizard, Eric a Jaguar and you chose a Mane Wolf. You set this… transformation to last two days until you have to return home.”<br />
<br />
Max nods, “th-that sums it up,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Why did you choose to become one of my kind,” the feral asks.<br />
<br />
“I… I love all canines,” Max says, “dogs, wolves, foxes.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” the Mane Wolf says, it looks at Max in silence for a while, ‘this pup is interesting. If what he told me is true, and I have no doubt about that, I got to know more about that program.’<br />
<br />
“Um…,” Max says, the animal looks at him, “c-can I return to my camp now?”<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf shakes his head, “no,” it says, “I still have some questions,” it then takes on a more relaxing pose and sits down on his hind-legs.<br />
<br />
Max notices the animal seeming to relax, so he relaxes himself, sitting up straight, “o-okay… what do you want to know,” he asks, still sounding nervous.<br />
<br />
“Why are you so nervous,” the Mane Wolf asks, “I am not even planning on hurting you anymore.”<br />
<br />
“I… I know,” Max says, “I can tell by your pose. It’s… it’s just that… I don’t know… something about you… the vibe I get off of you… it… it feels intimidating… like… um… if you’d have authority… you know… something like a “leader”… I guess you’d call it “alpha”.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm…,” the Mane Wolf says, “is that so,” he asks, it then grins when Max nods, “I will take that as a compliment… especially after my pack chased me away,” it mumbles the last sentence.<br />
<br />
But Max heard the sentence clearly, thanks to his new hearing, “wh-what,” he asks, “wh-why did they chase you away?”<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf looks surprised, but then sighs, “I was hoping you wouldn’t hear that,” he says, “I guess your hearing is just as good as mine. I really don’t want to talk about it, let’s just say: my pack decided I was the weakest.”<br />
<br />
“I… I’m sorry,” Max says.<br />
<br />
The feral Mane Wolf grins, “don’t be,” it says, “hearing you seeing me as an “alpha” makes me feel proud and happy.” It then tilts his head, “you… on the other hand… you would be an “omega”,” it says, “you have that submissive vibe about you… and you are still acting so nervous.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Max says, “wh-what does that mean… being an “omega”?”<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf grins, “that means you are the weakest,” he says, it then gets an idea, “tell me, pup,” it then says, “would you do anything I say?”<br />
<br />
Max is taken aback and surprised at the question, “wh-what do you mean,” he asks, sounding confused.<br />
<br />
“Would you obey me,” the feral animal asks, “follow my orders?”<br />
<br />
“I…,” Max hesitates, “I think so… a-at least my instincts tell me too.”<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf grins, he slowly gets to its feet and slowly walks closer to Max, who starts to back away, “stop moving,” the animal then growls, then grins when Max freezes, his tail between his legs. When the Mane Wolf reaches Max, it starts sniffing his body, even sniffing Max’s crotch, causing the Mane Wolf-boy to blush, but he is to afraid to say or do anything. The Mane Wolf then slowly circles the hybrid, before sitting down in front of him, “what do your instincts tell you exactly,” it then asks.<br />
<br />
“Th-they tell me I m-must s-submit to you,” Max stammers, “that you are… are my “alpha”… that… that I have to obey and do anything you order.”<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf loves the sound of that, “then you should listen to your instincts,” it says, “tell me, pup: does this program, that transformed you, does it have the ability to also… transform animals?”<br />
<br />
Max hesitates, he then nods, “y-yes… sir,” he says, he then blinks, “wh-what… why did I say that?”<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf chuckles, “well… I am the alpha,” it says.<br />
<br />
“Bu-but y-you are not m-my alpha,” Max says, “y-you don’t have authority over me.”<br />
<br />
“Silence,” the animal growls, then it grins when Max tenses, “you have entered my territory, therefor you belong to me. I am your alpha, and you will do what ever I say and you’ll follow every single order I give you.”<br />
<br />
Max’s eyes widen, “wh-what if… what if I refuse?”<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf grins evilly, “there are theroetically three options,” he says, “the first one is: we fight, the loser will submit himself to the winner, the second option is: you submit yourself to me and become my “omega”,” it says, “or the third option is:… I’ll kill you!”<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf grins at Max’s horror, “I know you would never fight me, so, that option is off the table,” he says, “So, which of the other options should it be, pup?”<br />
<br />
Max is horrified, his instincts kick in, telling him that the alpha was right: he, Max, is far to weak and inexperienced in fighting, so he’d lose to the much older and more experienced animal. Before he even realizes what he is doing, he gets up onto his hands, he then turns on all fours, his butt facing the feral Mane Wolf and raises his tail.<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf understands what Max means, the animal grins wide, feeling his cock emerge from his sheath, “wise choice, pup,” it says, raising to his own feet and slowly moves into position behind Max. The feral doesn’t waste a second, he jumps up on his hind-legs and grabs Max’s thighs with his front paws, “time for you to learn your place, pup,” he growls into Max’s ear, as he starts to thrust.<br />
<br />
Max is horrified, he’s being mounted by a wild animal, the former human teen is to afraid to try and break free, “pl-please… I am n-not g-gay,” he whimpers.<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf chuckles as it continues to thrust, trying to find his mark, “this is normal,” he says, “this is how dominant animals, like myself, show weaker animals their place,” finally with, with one strong thrust, the Mane Wolf hits home, letting out a howl triumphantly, while Max lets out a pain filled yowl as the huge cock of the Mane Wolf pops into his tight ass, stretching it painfully as it continues to slip in deeper with each of the Wolf’s thrusts.<br />
<br />
“It… it hurts,” Max whimpers, “pl-please… st-stop,” tears well up in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Mrrrr… so t-tight,” the Mane Wolf says, “you will… soon get used to it, pup. You are now… mine… you will do anything I say! You will obey me for the… rest… of your life!”<br />
<br />
Max sobs, “y-yes… alpha,” he whimpers in defeat, knowing he has no other choice.<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf grins, “do as told,” he says, “obey… me, and… I will reward you… disobey me… and you’ll regret it!”<br />
<br />
As the Mane Wolf continues to thrust in and out of his ass, Max suddenly feels the pain subside and be replaced by pleasure, the hybrid starts to moan and pant, his own cock emerging from his sheath. Max’s eyes fog over as the lust grows in him, fogging his mind, “yes… alpha,” he says, “I’ll obey… pl-please… f-fuck me ha-harder!”<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf smirks, “hehe, already broken,” he asks, “hehe… that was quick. I guess… your… instincts are to blame… hehe… listen to them, they know what the right thing is… tell me, pup: what is the right thing?”<br />
<br />
“To… to serve… you, alpha,” Max says, “f-for eternity!”<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf grins, “good boy, pup,” he says.<br />
<br />
Hearing his alpha praise him, causes Max to feel a strange feeling of pride raise in him, his tail starts to wag as his alpha starts to pound his ass faster and harder, the Mane Wolf’s knot popping in and out of his ass, noticeably starting to swell.<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf grins, “feels good… doesn’t it,” he asks, “being bred… being claimed by your alpha!”<br />
<br />
“Ye-yes… so g-good,” Max whines, “pl-please, alpha… c-cum in me!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I will,” the animal says, “I’ll fill you up with my cum. I am close!”<br />
<br />
Max feels the Mane Wolf’s knot pop into him, but not popping back out as it swells, locking the two together.<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf thrusts become faster and shorter, then the animal feels his balls churn, “here… it comes, pup,” he pants, “get ready… to be filled,” he then thrusts hard one last time, before both let out satisfied and triumph sounding howls as both cum, the Mane Wolf shooting his seed deep into Max’s body, while Max squirts his own seed on the jungle floor. The Mane Wolf climbs down from Max’s back and turns around, so that their buts are together, both pant as they wait for the knot to deflate.<br />
<br />
“Alpha,” Max pants, “th-that was… amazing! Th-thank you f-for showing me… my place… I for always obey… you!”<br />
<br />
The Mane Wolf chuckles, “good pup,” he says, “you felt amazing, better than any… female.”<br />
<br />
Max felt happy and proud, his instincts overwriting his rational thinking, locking his mind to obey his alpha, although he still remembers who he is and who his friends are, he feels more strongly connected to the animal knotted to him.</p>
