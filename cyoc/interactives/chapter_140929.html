<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff practically rocked back and forth in his chair, mulling over the stats of Subject 2, also known as the giant hunk of muscle, Dominic. His eyes lit up as they landed on a button to copy the parameters. His average cock pulsed in his pants and he found himself fishing into his briefs and fondling his raging hard-on. He winced, his balls and cock were so tender from rubbing himself raw, watching his emo twink brother and the man-mountain go at it. But, he couldn&#39;t help himself. He&#39;d always liked looking at bigger dudes on the net, but this was the first time he&#39;d seen a real muscle monster go at it. And it was everything he had wanted and more.<br />
<br />
His hand became a blur in his pants as he furiously beat off, panting as he clicked on Subject 3... himself. He briefly looked over what he saw, slightly embarrassed at his own pathetic size. But that was about to change. He pasted Dominic&#39;s stats onto himself. Breathing heavily, he scrolled through the available options, changing the personality to match his own, or at least the idealized version of his own persona. Smiling, he was ready to become huge...<br />
<br />
But he could always be bigger.<br />
<br />
Jeff slid the dials, pulled the proverbial levers, amping up what he&#39;d become. He&#39;d turned Dominic into a massive beast, but Jeff would make even him look small. The 16 year old shot blanks into his pants as he slid his height up to an impressive 6&#39;10&quot;, inches taller than the massive man that was already going at it again in the room next door. He watched as the weight had scaled up to over 500 pounds to keep the build in scale. But Jeff wanted more than what Dom had. He slid it up, the weight going past 600 pounds, sliding it up to 650, muscular beyond reason. Jeff pawed at himself with abandon, sliding the slider up for his cock and ball size. So delirious with lust, he didn&#39;t even check how big he had made himself.<br />
<br />
Unloading a watery, tiny dribble in his pants once again, Jeff was finally ready. Happy with his changes, he hit the submit button. He smiled as he jumped onto his bed, sat back and spread his legs. He zipped down his fly and tugged at his prick through his underwear, wanting to feel his cock grow between his fingers.<br />
<br />
It came like a tidal wave, Jeff felt his whole body shudder as the growth began to take hold. &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he cooed to himself as he gave himself a flex. &quot;Oh man, this feels better than I could ever have imagined!&quot; he moaned as he felt his cock bloat and grow, pushing his fingers apart, the palms of his hands becoming rougher from lifting heavy weights. But as soothing as the sensation was, as awesome as it was to feel his chest press against his chin as he tried to look down, his thoughts felt... loose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, shit...&quot; Jeff whimpered as his body went into auto-pilot. His hands were double-fisting his growing meat, his massive balls cascaded out of his undies as they split apart from his growing quads and glutes, not to mention his prodigious package. His thoughts were become fuzzy, unclear, the memories beginning to slide and slip around like putty, easily reformed. &quot;Fuaccck,&quot; he bellowed, a splattering of cum geysering out of his massive tool.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d forgotten to change the option to make himself unaware of his changes. Just like Dominic and his brother, Chris, he&#39;d think he&#39;d always have been the guy he was turning into. And just like his brother and his new lover, the other two would be completely caught off guard by the changes.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his old life melting away, the Chronivac whirring in the background as it rewrote reality to match one where a 16 year old boy had become a massive 650 pound beast, almost 7&#39; feet tall and hung like a horse and gifted as a bull...<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
In the next room over, Chris was getting pounded by his hulking friend and loving every moment of it. But out of the corner of his eye, he saw something strange. Pockets of reality were shifting, changing, almost as if glitched. It was almost imperceptible and he thought nothing of it, closing his eyes and moaning as his ass was invaded by Dominic&#39;s huge 13&quot; prick once more...<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Jeff shuddered awake. He chuckled as he shook off the cobwebs of drying cum splattered all around his hairy, massive quads. He always did like to rub one out mid-afternoon. His hand roamed up to play with his cum-crusted abs, a thick, bloated ball of muscle. A roidgut by any other name, but Jeff hadn&#39;t touched them, nor did he need to. Besides, roids would&#39;ve diminished his greatest assets. His cock sprung to life, reaching it&#39;s apex of 20&quot; rock hard in seconds, his gigantic balls roiling with fresh teen-cum. He slowly thrummed his hands against his length, enjoying the sheer size of his arms, shoulders and pecs as they all fought for space, the tiniest of motions causing his body to become extremely pumped.<br />
<br />
He looked up to see his computer sitting there idle, the Chronivac on standby. He smirked and lumbered his way over to his desktop, hunching over to see that the machine was on himself. Odd, why the heck would he want to change himself? He was pretty damn perfect the way he was! Though, he did entertain the thought of getting even BIGGER. He shook his head and looked at the other two subjects open on the program and smiled.<br />
<br />
Subject 1 was his brother. Heh, Jeff took great enjoyment in the changes he had made to him. In this reality, Chris had been a massive beast, just like Jeff, and the hulking teen loved the fact that his once domineering older brother was now a tiny twink. He rubbed his gargantuan balls, they gurgled in response. Oh, he was going to enjoy thrusting his godhood into that tight little hole.<br />
<br />
Subject 2 was his brother&#39;s friend, Dominic. Jeff felt a little sorry for little Dommy. He&#39;d always been so small compared to him and Chris so he had decided to give him a little boost, but nowhere near as close to his size.<br />
<br />
The teenbeast stretched and rolled his shoulders, letting his massive tool bob out in front of him. He could hear his twink of a brother getting butt-blasted next door and smiled, he&#39;d like a turn. He had to duck and turn to the side just to get out into the hallway, and his shoulders brushed against both walls once he was in it. Without knocking, he entered his once larger brother&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, Dominic was balls deep in his best friend... They both froze as they looked up at Jeff, both unsure of who the hairy, musclebound behemoth could be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, &#39;little&#39; bro. Hey, Dom,&quot; Jeff boomed, cupping his maleness in the palm of his hand. He took one step forward and he could see the arousal in both the smaller guys&#39; loins.<br />
<br />
Little did any of them know, the Chronivac was hard at work, parsing together a reality in which Jeff&#39;s changes were the norm...</p>
