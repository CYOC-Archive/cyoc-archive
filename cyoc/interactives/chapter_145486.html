<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle opened his mouth to respond, but Mark placed a hand over Kyle’s mouth, effectively silencing him. He held Kyle firmly against the wall. Kyle struggled against his older and much stronger brother.<br />
<br />
“Uh-uh,” Mark said. “You don’t get to choose. If you choose, I’ll make your life in this world a living hell.” Kyle glared at Mark. “You want to become attracted to…” Mark had to think back to the term Chris had used, “…girls in a world full of men?” Kyle’s eyes grew wide, and he stopped struggling.<br />
<br />
After a minute had passed, Mark lowered his hand from Kyle’s mouth but still kept him pinned against the wall.<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Kyle growled. “Do whatever you want. But I know that since Jake cursed you, you can’t do anything to stop the changes.”<br />
<br />
Mark smirked and said, “Jake didn’t use the curse on me. His brother did. I can do whatever the hell I want with you.”<br />
<br />
Kyle froze and asked, “But why? Why are you helping Jake? You don’t even know anything has changed.”<br />
<br />
“Chris Perkins knows something has changed,” Mark answered. “And he’s my boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
“In this reality,” Kyle grumbled.<br />
<br />
“In every reality,” Mark spat. He had enough of his brother speaking. “For your Dare, you will do everything that I tell you to do.” He thought over the second part. “I will save your Transform for later.”<br />
<br />
“You can do that?” Kyle asked.<br />
<br />
“Stop talking,” Mark ordered. Kyle immediately closed his mouth. He clearly wanted to say something but was unable. The realization of that was starting to him like a ton of bricks. “Follow me.”<br />
<br />
The two walked back through the halls of the school to the bathroom. The bell still hadn’t rung yet. The same guys were still at it, albeit a little further along than the last time. Those making out were now licking nipples. The ones who had been grinding their crotches into each other were now massaging ass cheeks. The ones who had been massaging each other’s cocks were either openly masturbating or giving or receiving blowjobs. Mark smirked a little and fondled his cock as he passed by the assistant baseball coach going down on the art teacher. His flowery blouse was open with his tits exposed to the air. He moaned deeply and pinched his nipples while the coach picked up speed. Leaving his erect cock out of his boxers, Mark continued on with a wide-eyed Kyle.<br />
<br />
They reached the bathroom, and Mark knocked three times. There was a pause before he heard the lock turn. Mark grabbed his brother and shoved him inside. He ducked under the “Out of Order” sign. He closed the door behind him.<br />
<br />
Jake and Chris were leaning against the wall and looked up when the two had entered. Jake flushed red with embarrassment while Chris frowned.<br />
<br />
“Mark, put your dick back in your boxers, please,” Chris said. Mark stared at his boyfriend for a confused second and shrugged. If that would make him feel better, of course he would. He stuffed his dick back into his boxers, which felt horribly confining. He raised a questioning eyebrow at Chris, who nodded in appreciation. Then they turned to Mark’s brother.<br />
<br />
“Kyle, turn around and look at me,” Mark said. Kyle did as he was told. Mark glanced up at Chris. Chris seemed on edge and uncomfortable. Mark wanted to be able to comfort him, and the only way he felt he could do that was to understand what was happening around them.<br />
<br />
“Kyle, use the curse on me,” Mark said. “When I say, ‘Dare,’ you will dare me to be aware of the changes happening to the world. After that, you will resume not speaking.” Chris and Jake’s eyebrows shot up.<br />
<br />
“Mark, Transform or Dare?” Kyle asked.<br />
<br />
“Dare.”<br />
<br />
“You will be aware of the changes happening to the world.” Kyle frowned and fumed in silence.<br />
<br />
Mark felt the curse hitting him and closed his eyes with a groan. He remembered the hallway. The art teacher was supposed to be a woman. The assistant baseball coach was engaged to be married to a woman. All of the guys he had passed in the hallway were supposed to be dressed! Now he understood how Jake would become frightened and angry. Mark was angry now, too. He opened his eyes and scowled at Kyle.<br />
<br />
“Why did you do that?” Chris asked, slowly walking over to him.<br />
<br />
“I was starting to have trouble accepting the fact that you didn’t like the world like this,” Mark said. “That would’ve hurt you, and I didn’t want to do that.” Chris blushed and smiled. He didn’t know what to say and just simply hugged Mark.<br />
<br />
Jake coughed a little and the two returned their focus back to the matter at hand. Kyle was gaping at the two of them.<br />
<br />
“So now what?” Chris asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, he is obeying my every word right now,” Mark said. “That’s how he has the curse. I haven’t used his Transform yet. Couldn’t think of something fitting for him yet.”<br />
<br />
“Ask him what is the world changing into,” Jake said.<br />
<br />
Mark pointedly at Kyle and said, “Answer our questions truthfully and completely.” Kyle blinked and glared at Mark. “What is the world changing into?”<br />
<br />
“The kind that changes all the time,” Kyle answered in spite of himself. “I had a list of changes at home that the world would change into every month. The changes would be gradual before reverting back to how reality normally was.”<br />
<br />
“So this gay, male, naked, horny world is just one of many?” Chris asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Kyle replied.<br />
<br />
“What are the others?” Mark asked.<br />
<br />
“A world of anthropomorphic animals where humans gradually turn into anthro animals, a world of huge sexual attributes where guys will have huge muscles and massive cocks, a world similar to this one except its all females instead of males, a world similar to regular reality accept everyone is gay, a world where sex happens regularly with no taboos, a world where everybody is sexually attracted to and worships me, and finally a world where everyone switches gender characteristics.” Kyle finally finished speaking and took deep breaths to refill his lungs. Meanwhile, Jake, Chris, and Mark stared at Kyle with varying degrees of shock.<br />
<br />
“Seven months of changes,” Chris mumbled.<br />
<br />
“And I would be just along for the ride whether or not I liked any of that,” Jake added.<br />
<br />
“While the rest of us would change constantly without being aware,” Mark finished. The three stood there in stunned silence for several minutes.<br />
<br />
“What do we do now?” Jake asked.</p>
