<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a while of admiring herself, “Natsumi” decides to take a walk, “hehe… it’s going to be so much fun teasing all the boys with this body,” the “girl” says as she puts her clothes back on, “sorry boys… this “girl” is not interested in a relationship!”<br />
<br />
Once dressed, “Natsumi” grabs her keys, a book, her phone, powers down her laptop and heads out the house, deciding to head to the park.<br />
<br />
It is a warm late spring afternoon with a clear blue sky, “Natsumi” smiles, enjoying the breeze ruffling her hair and grins mentally whenever she notices a boy staring at her.<br />
<br />
When the “girl” arrives at the park she finds a nice spot under a tree, making herself comfortable, “Natsumi” begins reading in the book she brought with her: a fantasy novel about some teenage adventurer who travels to Egypt to find the lost temple of Anubis.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” grins mentally, ‘I wonder how long it will take for a boy to walk up to me and start a conversation,’ she thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
Not more than 30 minutes, “Natsumi” hears footsteps approach her and a shadow of someone soon appears on the page she is currently reading. Looking up “Natsumi” notices a Japanese boy, maybe not older than 13, with short black smooth hair, brown eyes, an athletic body and wearing a blue t-shirt and blue jeans shorts standing two feet in front of her with a nervous look on his face.<br />
<br />
“Can I help you,” the “girl” asks the boy, ‘I must say… he does look kinda handsome, I never really noticed how handsome Japanese are’.<br />
<br />
The boy nervously and shyly rubs the back of his neck, “um… sorry for bothering you,” he says, even his voice sounds nervous, “I… I couldn’t help but notice you sitting here by yourself. I… I haven’t seen many fellow Japanese in this city. I… I just moved here a month ago, so… I don’t have many friends”. The boy shuffles his feet, “I… was wondering… if I could get to know you,” he then says shyly.<br />
<br />
‘He looks so cute when he’s nervous and shy,’ the “girl” thinks to herself, she then lets out a chuckle and smiles, “why not, you seem like a nice guy,” she says, “what’s your name? My name is Natsumi Tahara”.<br />
<br />
The boy noticeably relaxes, a small shy smile appearing on his face, “my… my name is Hiro… Hiro Tanaka,” he says, “it… it’s a pleasure to meet you, Natsumi”.<br />
<br />
“Hiro...,” the “girl” repeats, then smiles, “what a cool name”.<br />
<br />
The boy blushes, “th-thanks,” he says, “I think you have a beautiful name”.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” smiles, “thank you, Hiro,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Um… can… can I join you?”<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” nods, “please,” she says, gesturing to her right.<br />
<br />
Hiro smiles before sitting down next to the “girl”, “again… sorry for bothering you,” he says, “what kind of book are you reading, if you don’t mind me asking. I enjoy reading myself”.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s a fantasy adventure novel,” the “girl” says, “it’s about a teenage boy who goes to Egypt to try and find the lost temple of Anubis”.<br />
<br />
Hiro’s eyes widen, “wow, I never heard of that story,” he says, “it sounds interesting and exciting, I’d need to check it out”.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” smiles, “you should, it’s a great read,” she says.<br />
<br />
Hiro smiles back, ‘wow… she’s got a beautiful smile,’ he thinks to himself, ‘and she is looks so stunning… man… I hope… I hope she is single and that we’ll become more than just friends’.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” lies her book down, “tell me something about yourself,” she says, “what interests do you have? Were you born in the States?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I besides reading, I enjoy doing sports, like soccer and basketball, I also do parkour,” Hiro says, “and yes, I was born in the States. We lived in a different state, but due to work, my parents moved here”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” the “girl” says, “what do your parents work?”<br />
<br />
“My dad is a Senator, democratic, and my mom is an actress,” Hiro says.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi’s” eyes widen, “I thought your surname sounded familiar,” she says, “is your mother by any chance Hinata Tanaka?”<br />
<br />
Hiro nods, “yup,” he says, beaming, “I guess you saw a movie in which she played?”<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” nods, “I saw “The Empress”, I think your mother had the leading role?”<br />
<br />
Again Hiro nods, “yup,” he says.<br />
<br />
“So cool,” the “girl” says, smiling, “your mother is an amazing actress. Your family must be extremely wealthy”.<br />
<br />
Hiro nods, “yeah, we are,” he says, “but we don’t boast about our wealth, we are a humble family,” he continues, “my parents donate money to charity, especially animal, children and homeless”.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” smiles, “then you are one of the, sadly, few rich folks who have a heart!”<br />
<br />
Hiro nods, “yeah… I’m not even friends with our neighbor’s kids,” he says, “they are all… stuck ups”.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” nods, “yeah… I know what you mean,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Anyway, enough about me,” Hiro says, “tell me something about you”.<br />
<br />
“Well, I have the same interests as you, but my family is not wealthy, we aren’t struggling though,” the “girl” says, “my mother is a teacher, and my dad works at a manufacturer”.<br />
<br />
Hiro smiles, “as long as you have enough money to pay bills and have food on the table and a roof over your head,” he says, “you don’t need to be wealthy”.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” smiles, ‘I can’t tell him what the real Natsumi’s parents work as,’ she thinks to herself, ‘the real Natsumi, her family is wealthy themselves, I just hope Hiro doesn’t live anywhere near her’.<br />
<br />
Hiro notices “Natsumi’s” thoughtful expression, “what are you thinking about, Natsumi?”<br />
<br />
The “girl” blinks, “oh… I was just about to ask where you live”.<br />
<br />
“King’s Boulevard,” Hiro says, “you?”<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” relaxes a little, ‘thank god, the real Natsumi lives on the other side of town,’ she thinks to herself, “I live about an hour away from here,” she then says, “in the street called “Little Kingston”. What school do you go to?”<br />
<br />
“A private school,” Hiro says.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” relaxes a little more, ‘so far so good, Natsumi attends the same high school as my sister,’ she thinks to herself, “I attend St. Jone’s high school,” she then says, which is not the school the real Natsumi attends.<br />
<br />
Hiro looks at “Natsumi”, “do… do you mind if I ask you something… personal?”<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” looks at Hiro, “sure,” she says.<br />
<br />
“D-do you have… a boyfriend,” the boy asks, blushing and with a nervous look in his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” mentally sighs, ‘I figured he’d ask that sooner or later,’ she thinks to herself, “I don’t, however I am currently not interested in starting a relationship,” she then says.<br />
<br />
“Oh…,” Hiro says, sounding a little disappointed and “Natsumi” notices his expression becoming sad as he turns his head away.<br />
<br />
‘Oh… boy,’ the “girl” thinks to herself, being a boy herself, even if it’s currently just mentally, Jeff of course how much it pains to have a girl say something like that, even though it isn’t a direct rejection. Jeff can’t help but feel sorry for the boy, she lies a hand on Hiro’s shoulder, “listen, Hiro,” she says, the boy looks at the “girl”, “do not feel upset,” the “girl” continues, “you are a handsome boy, you will find a girlfriend sooner or later,” before she adds, “besides, we have only just met… who knows how this will develop”. Jeff mentally facepalms himself, ‘what the FUCK did I just say,’ he asks himself.<br />
<br />
Hiro smiles at the “girl”, “thanks, Natsumi,” he says, “I understand, and you are right… best to take it slow and see how it will develop instead of diving headfirst into a relationship and regret it”.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” smiles, “I don’t blame you,” she says, “I mean… I’m one hell of a hot chick,” she chuckles, “you aren’t the first boy I had to disappoint. As I have said: I just don’t feel that I am ready yet”.<br />
<br />
Hiro nods, “I get it,” he says, smiling, “and I have to say, even if it hurts a little, there is still… hope for me”.<br />
<br />
‘I have to be careful what I say,’ Jeff thinks to himself, “don’t get your hopes to high, Hiro,” the “girl” says, “I wouldn’t want to disappoint you even more”.<br />
<br />
Hiro nods, “don’t worry, Natsumi,” he says, “I won’t”.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” smiles, removing her hand from Hiro’s shoulder, “at least I know that you have a big interest in me,” she says, “we’ll see where this will lead, for now though: let’s just be friends”.<br />
<br />
Hiro smiles, “and that makes me happy,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” smiles, she then looks down at her watch, “man, time flies,” she says before looking at Hiro, “sorry, Hiro, I’d have to go”.<br />
<br />
“No worries,” the boy says, “do you mind if we trade numbers?”<br />
<br />
“Natsumi” looks at the boy, ‘a part of me wants to say “no”, however, Hiro is such a cool guy,’ she thinks to herself, ‘would it really be that bad to give him my number?’</p>
