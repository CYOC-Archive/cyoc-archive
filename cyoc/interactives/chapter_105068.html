<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Laureen stood there and decided to wear a belled jester outfit.  She though to herself "this will just be temporary!  I won't really go outside in this, I will keep this nice lady company."<br />
<br />
First Laureen noticed a pair of black and white diamond leggings so she took them with her to put on.  She needed to take her off her large ugg boots.  She had average size feet for a woman but wore the tall ugg boots and folded them down to expose the inner fur.<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
"What's a jester without the black and white diamond patterns."  The leggings were so smooth and cottony soft.  It looks like her butt looked a little bigger in them and felt a little bigger and firm.  She just figured it was the design that caused it to look bigger.<br />
<br />
Laureen took the costume which was half pink or one side and half bluish green on the other side.<br />
 -------------<br />
The similar to the costume in this link <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
She slipped into the one piece costume and asked the lady to zip up the back. <br />
<br />
She noticed as she drew the costume over the rest of her body and  slid her black and white diamond legging covered legs into the costume, the legs of the jester costume slid up just below here knees and above her shins.   It exposed the leggings she was wearing.<br />
<br />
She modeled in front of the mirror in the bathroom and figured that's odd this costume must be too small for me.  But she wondered why the arms went right to her wrists and why the back area where her but was was so loose fitting.  The rest of the costume fit perfectly although she did feel like her boobs were just slightly larger and a little heavier.   She really didn't think much of this.<br />
<br />
Suddenly she looked to her right and saw on the hook for towels a large puffy yellowish gold clown ruffle collar which had 7 large jingle bells attached all around it.  She put it on and realized it was kinda a little too puffy and big for her to wear so she tried to take it off.  Laureen struggled to get it off but the knot she tied seemed to be stuck. <br />
<br />
"Oh well I guess I can put up with this for a little while."<br />
<br />
She put some gloves on as well. One was bluish green with 2 pink pom poms and the other was pink with  bluish gree pom poms.  Laureen put them on so they we're opposite matching of her costume (as shown in the link above).<br />
<br />
She loved the yellow buttons on the front as they were very puffy and soft. They some how jingled.  She then saw two pink and white striped slippers on the floor and put them on.<br />
---------------<br />
 similar to the ones in this link <br />
<br />
,R35397116128809<br />
<br />
The slippers were way to large for her feet.   "Typical for a clown!" She thought.<br />
Both slippers had 7 jingle bells around the ankles and at the tip of the curly toes was a large jingle bell firmly attached.  They jingled so loudly with each step she took.  The curled toes were very firm and stayed in place as she walked, they did not flop around at all.  Some how the slippers stayed firmly on her feet as she walked, even though they were so big.  They felt just like she was wearing her ugg boots!  She loved how comfortable and firm they felt!<br />
<br />
"Ta da! Here is Laureen the clown!"<br />
<br />
The lady looked at her and told her Laureen the clown was not a good name and that she needs to create an alternate name.  She also told Laureen the slippers were not the matching ones to the costume and handed her the correct ones.  They were yellow gold color (as shown in the costume picture) and also had seven jingles bells on the ankles and one firmly attached large jingle bell on each curly toe point.  They were also slight larger that the jester slippers she already had on.  The curled toes also were firm and stayed in places as she walked around, they did not flop around.<br />
<br />
Laureen went to to the bathroom again and tried to take off the striped slippers.  She tried for 20 minutes and they would not budge.  "Why won't these come off?  This is so weird!"  She then thought maybe I can slip them into the yellowish gold jester shoes.  When she put the right slipper tip into the yellow gold jester slipper, it just slip right in.  The curled toe of the pink slipper slid as it conformed to the yellow gold slipper with no issue!  The other striped one did as well.  <br />
<br />
"Wow!  That was kinda cool!  But still very strange!"<br />
<br />
Laureen walked around the bathroom testing the new jester shoes out. They were a little harder to walk around in and she tripped a few times but managed to adjust to them.  They jingled even louder.  <br />
"What is with everything having 7 bells?"  She thought to herself.<br />
<br />
She suddenly saw a sparkly red clown nose.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
She picked it up and placed it on her nose.  As it touched her nose it almost felt like it sucked on to her face.  When she let go it stayed on its own.  She tried to take it off but it would not budge.  "That's some strong clown nose glue!" she said.  She did not realize there was no glue on the inside of the nose.  "Maybe the old lady has some stuff to get this off later.<br />
<br />
Laureen then squeezed her red sparkly nose and it honked!  It sent a small shiver of excitement through her body and costume and made butt but become bigger and fill in the rear of the costume better.  <br />
<br />
Laureen honked the nose 2 more times and felt a little silly and felt that wave of excitement.  She gave it one more honk and suddenly the clown name Lulu popped into Laureen's mind.  <br />
<br />
Laureen pranced out of the bathroom and made a small jump in the air......<br />
<br />
<br />
"Ta da! Here is Lulu the clown!"  She the squeezed her nose twice not even thinking about it and let out two high pitched honks from the nose!<br />
<br />
HONK HONK!!!!<br />
"Wow what came over me to honk my nose so much!" She said.<br />
<br />
