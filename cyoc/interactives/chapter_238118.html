<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Calum was angry. His body was being hijacked by his dad, he couldn&#39;t just be natural, but even if he could he&#39;s so messed up now that he doesn&#39;t even know if he wants that, and he just wanted to teach his dad a lesson. Everything is broken and he just wants to burn it down and start over!<br />
<br />
30 minutes later Calum was on the back porch smoking a cigar contemplating how everything went wrong. He felt amazing, but of course he did, how the hell was he going to fix this? He took a deep frustrated drag and held it in his sinuses letting the nicotine permeate his soft tissues before exhaling and blowing it all away... What possessed him to do this to himself? How could he disentangle himself while he&#39;s still so angry? He ashed his cigar smearing it on the railing, spitefully loving that it will be there till the next rain and his father will obsess over it but do nothing.<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s back up. <br />
<br />
Calum stopped time as his parents were preparing to engage one another. The Chronivac, a new tool with unlimited potential, and before it, Calum, a violated boy forced to embody his father&#39;s dreams.<br />
<br />
Calum felt all the feelings. His puberty spurred on by the regular dose of hormones he was receiving, everything felt like life or death to him, though he didn&#39;t want to kill his father. Making his father love turning into something he would revile felt appropriate given his own tenuous relationship with his body.<br />
<br />
In a series of questionable choices Calum set his father up to be unable to get off at anything other than watching his wife get railed, or getting railed himself... but that wasn&#39;t enough. Being used as a science experiment and pushed into diets and drugs at his father&#39;s whim, the powerlessness of being unable to resist... He set himself up to personally take everything from his father.<br />
<br />
Calum set his age to double any time his step-mother was ready for intimacy, his father would feel it in his gut too. A deep yearning but would be unable to do anything about it. He would be drawn into the bedroom corner to masturbate and watch. Calum would hate fuck his step mom, he would overshadow his inept father and they would all think this is normal...<br />
<br />
Calum, high on the throughs of testosterone, was about to click submit but that wasn&#39;t enough disgrace! His father wanted him to be the pinnacle of perfection and was happy to pervert Calum&#39;s body to achieve it... its time he give something up for his goals! His dad&#39;s balls, no! His whole scrotum will fall off and attach to Calum&#39;s merging to make up for the drugs which screwed over his natural development... and length... his dad will shrink to 1 inch... no, half an inch... and Calum will gain the length and girth!<br />
<br />
Calum orchestrated that the transfer will be wretchedly painful for his dad, and euphoric, a process his dad would be fully aware of but couldn&#39;t bring himself to stop... the transfer culminating through his father performing oral expertly. An act and skill he would surely consider not masculine and hate having. After which, Calum would beat up his father and his father would thank him for it.<br />
<br />
Lastly, his father&#39;s obsession with health and well being while being a corrosive cancer to all he contacted... Calum hated the idea of smoking but wanted to spite his father so much, its worth it just to piss him off... He would hate fuck his step mom while smoking a cigar and his father would get off to it! Then his dad would suck him off, lose his manhood, get beaten up, and thank him. Calum typed up the scenario while frothing with rage and it was perfect... in the moment.<br />
<br />
Things played out exactly as Calum orchestrated and he was on the back porch smoking a cigar... at the moment he was 24 and slowly regressing. In his exuberant rage he failed to consider that he would actually be there doing these things. Words he and his friends threw around at school so casually, the spicy expletive they sprinkle in whenever they can get away with it... it means something. He was angry, and it felt like the right word to use, but he now knew it wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want to take part in any sexual acts, especially not with his step mom and dad, but he angrily typed it all out making it the new normal and the machine made it happen as he described. His penis was now 4 inches flaccid, 9 erect, and the 4 testicles in his scrotum were merging. He hated that his balls merging felt amazing. His dad&#39;s eager oral made his sack slowly pinch off and his dick shrink. He was crying silently as Calum got off. Calum grabbed the pouch and touched it to his scrotum and his sack grew and the contents aligned itself like soap bubbles merging. Then Calum started punching. He forgot he would be a 26 year old man and not a 13 year old kid when he was doing this. It was brutal.<br />
<br />
Daryl came out of the house, &quot;Hey dad, how&#39;s it going?&quot;<br />
&quot;Go back to what you were doing.&quot; Calum said... he had set this moment up as a final victory but now it felt hollow and he was unsure of himself despite accomplishing all the things that he planned.<br />
Daryl turned and went back inside.<br />
<br />
Calum trembled as he puffed his cigar, it was the only thing that felt normal about the situation because he programmed himself to be a smoker to spite his dad. He had regressed to 18 now and his balls were now the size of his and his dad&#39;s put together. No longer 4 separate balls. His body devoured what made his dad a man. No more cheating from now on, nothing but watching for him... <br />
<br />
Calum puffed his cigar like he&#39;d been smoking for years, but was interrupted feeling an awkward twinge... &quot;Oh no...&quot; he muttered realizing the autopilot he set up to be able to perform, explicitly removed his control. He ashed the cigar and put it in his mouth as he stepped back inside, &quot;I get the feeling someone&#39;s ready for seconds! Brycie boy, I hope you&#39;re ready to watch!&quot; He yelled throughout the house as his body was rapidly aging back to that of a 26 year old muscled sex god.<br />
<br />
Calum finished with his step mom yet again and was relieved he hadn&#39;t set his father up to be beaten up again. He hated how good sex felt, he hated doing it with his step mom, he hated the stench of his cigar and how effortlessly he functioned with it, and he hated his dad&#39;s broken and bruised body wheezing in the corner going through the motions of masturbating though he was clearly injured and now was neutered.<br />
<br />
Calum, released from his own programming, glanced at his father and left. He didn&#39;t like to see his father that way but would be lying to say he didn&#39;t deserve it. Calum took a shower during which he slowly regressed back to 13. He headed to bed exhausted, afraid to mess with the Chronivac while tired as he could make things worse.</p>
