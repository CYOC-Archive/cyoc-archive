<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel was not quite surprised when Trevor showed up just as she was leaving to take care of some technical issues in the lower part of the pool. &quot;Hey Rachel, if that uhh, preworkout or whatever really helped you that much, I wanna give it a try.&quot; She hoped that Trevor would show some self control with it. She fully intended to let other men use it - and then see what kind of effects it might have should someone go over the dosage limit. She knew Trevor well enough to know that if something felt good, he&#39;d chase after it. Hence why he got so into whoever he had a relationship with whenever he got with a woman - Trevor was almost comically overenthusiastic for sex.<br />
<br />
He was dressed as of now in his lifeguard outfit - which amounted to a swimsuit and a short sleeved shirt with the swim location&#39;s logo at the front.<br />
<br />
A few times, before Jeff, she would just see how much she could do with him before he ultimately blew his load. As impressive as Trevor looked, and this man did look amazing, he had absolutely terrible stamina and self control. The moment he got his dick inside her he just thrust away as fast as he could, desperately chasing orgasm. Any other woman might&#39;ve called it off - seeing Trevor as too dumb, too overeager, too sensitive.<br />
<br />
Rachel just saw him as an experiment in what she could try with him and how long he could take it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go right ahead, big boy.&quot; She said as she walked off. Wondering if Trevor&#39;s stamina and self control had gotten better at all since their flings.<br />
<br />
Trevor for his part walked in and looked around, as if checking to see if anyone else was around and wanting to muscle in on his use of the drink. He really didn&#39;t like how judgmental Greg could be - the guy could really be pushy and he took his family&#39;s image way too seriously. There was definitely something going on with Daron - Trevor wasn&#39;t blind. Mostly one-sided on Daron&#39;s part. Guy always tried to wear the same stuff as Greg, even got the same swimsuits and such.<br />
<br />
Trevor didn&#39;t particularly get it, but he figured whatever Daron was doing, he obviously enjoyed doing it.<br />
<br />
Picking up one of the dosage bottles, Trevor contemplated, &quot;...This stuff sure did help Miss Rachel...&quot; Trevor wasn&#39;t exactly someone with a wealth of other opportunities. He&#39;d done terribly in school, simply not being book smart at all. It was a minor miracle he turned out to be so good at lifeguard stuff. So good in fact Eli had welcomed him in and nurtured him here. It was thanks to Eli&#39;s backing of him that Trevor got to meet Rachel.<br />
<br />
She was far from the first woman to let him do things with his dick. He lost his virginity quite early, once he discovered &quot;hey, this feels good!&quot; But she was also one of the smartest ones he did stuff with. And he hoped that if he could get some similarly impressive results, he might be able to get with her again. Her or one of the many hotties he worked with here.<br />
<br />
As Trevor opened the container and started drinking the Muscle Tech-X down, he wondered how fast the stuff would work. He certainly didn&#39;t expect what ended up happening next.<br />
<br />
He felt a very strong, spasmodic tingle run through his body from head to toe, his dick immediately jutting out hard as could be. &quot;Ohh, fuck, feels so good, gotta...I gotta---!!&quot; No, Trevor, no! He told himself. One of the few things he was told and remembered in sex ed was that publicly doing stuff was bad. He could get in a lot of trouble.  Ooh, but it felt so amazing, too!<br />
<br />
Trevor gulped as he looked down and saw his arms - his biceps and triceps seemed to be swelling, growing in mere moments. Thickening and growing larger. He bit his lip as he saw his forearms likewise growing stronger, veins pulsing along his arms. He recognized the way the muscles were growing in an almost line from his arms to his---!! &quot;Gaah!&quot; Trevor gasped, feeling his shoulders suddenly broaden all at once - each individual head pushing out more. Developing into a more boulder like countenance.<br />
<br />
Trevor&#39;s pretty face was getting stronger and more handsome in a classical way, his tan deepening outside his awareness - and he choked down a loud moan as he felt his chest surge and start tearing his shirt. &quot;My---My <i>uniform!</i> Uhhh! Oooh...no---no fair!!&quot; He felt his dick jerk in his increasingly tight swimsuit as he registered his chest and back fighting to put on size and tear through the increasingly too tight shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...&quot; Trevor gasped, and before long he started trying to take off his shirt. He was getting choked by the collar...too tight! Too tight! He knew Eli liked to have people wear the shirt instead of going around shirtless, but Trevor was growing too fast! &quot;Rachel&#39;s drink...mm...I&#39;m getting so buff...&quot; He tore the shirt in a few dozen places, but he finally got it off and sat there before long, a growing and increasingly turned on man desperately trying not to make a scene in a place too close to public.<br />
<br />
Trevor flexed his biceps lightly, tensing his forearms as well, watching his chest heave and his increasingly thick, dense and strong abs under his chest shape up. What had been simply the abs of a hobbyist, sculpted only by diet and swimming, were becoming thicker, broader, stronger...!<br />
<br />
Trevor tried to scratch his back but he found that his lats and back in general were too wide and well developed to reach back there. &quot;Aww, I&#39;m feeling an itch...back&#39;s too wide!&quot; But there was no doubting that as Trevor sat there, flexing his growing legs, watching his quads bunch up, pump and grow before his very eyes, he was feeling so incredibly good.<br />
<br />
Between his thick thighs and quads was a veritable anaconda - his manhood, feeling thicker and longer than ever even though he wasn&#39;t sure if that grew too. &quot;Mm...&quot; Trevor gulped and propped himself up, flexing his shoulders as he did. A few more pulses of growth, and Trevor had put on easily 35 lbs of muscle across his body, on top of toning up what he had already. He waited as he sat there, wondering if it was done. His ass felt so thick and strong, he swore he could balance a quarter on his butt!<br />
<br />
&quot;...Feel so good...fuck...gotta fuck.&quot; Trevor was at that stage of turned on when he needed to either jerk off or find someone ready and willing to fool around with him. His dick was pulsing in his almost ready to tear swimsuit. He could not go back out to work like this. Not with his cock standing out like that. He was more or less naked! Would---would Rachel be willing to help him out if she came back? He found himself remembering his sexual adventures with her...<br />
<br />
He remembered her taking his dick into his mouth, his licentious imagination bringing him pleasure on its own. Barely even realizing his manhood in the present was twitching away, eagerly anticipating sex. He remembered her introducing him to pleasure he hadn&#39;t even considered. She&#39;d one time---she&#39;d one time stuck a dildo up his butt! He thought it was gay at first, but when she started pumping it, up and down, in his butt, Trevor had found he liked it quite a lot.<br />
<br />
She called it...ooh! She called it his male G-Spot. The prostate. He barely remembered much of biology. But he did know a lot about his prostate and how it felt when it got stimulated. He vividly remembered Rachel kissing him and then guiding his manhood into her pussy...all the while...all the while, he had that dildo up his ass!<br />
<br />
Trevor moaned loud and suddenly, surprised out of his reverie by the shock of a sudden and thunderous orgasm. It rushed through his whole body in a way he had never experienced, his nipples standing up at sensitive attention, his sphincter clenching at once as his dick - nestled in his swimsuit - pumped, pulsed, and shot four whole huge loads on to the ground, the last smaller but leaving Trevor sitting there gasping for air and shaking.<br />
<br />
He---he had never even once before cum like that before.<br />
<br />
Trevor knew he needed to do that again and as soon as he could. Refractory period? He barely even knew what that was. He did know however enough to connect the drink he just consumed to that amazing orgasm he just had. He knew Rachel said that he could one &quot;a drink&quot;, but she never said how many &quot;a drinks&quot; he could have. Trevor grinned and picked up another dose of Muscle Tech-X. Thinking intently about how great it&#39;d feel if he could do that again. Maybe it&#39;d even give him another full body orgasm like that last one.<br />
<br />
Even as his swimsuit dripped with his emission, Trevor got ready to take another trip into the unknown.</p>
