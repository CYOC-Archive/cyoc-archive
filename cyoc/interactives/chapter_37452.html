<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mark was in his living room slowly becoming a werewolf, he remembered the first time he asked your mom out on a date. They went out to dinner at the local country club. It was a wonderful night although your mom thought that maybe she should have waited a little bit before she started dating again since the divorce was only final about 2-3 months before. He explained he was somewhat of a positive thinker and that you must move on.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know&quot; He said &quot;We have to keep moving forward. Life is like a shark. It has to constantly move forward, or it dies. Do know what I mean&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Mark that is so true&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me pay the check and then let's do something special. Let's take a walk though the woods. There's a full moon and, I don't know, It's so romantic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark paid the check and then drove your mom almost to your house. He then got out and opened the car door for your mom, like a gentleman should. He and your mom started walking but your mom noticed that for the past few minutes he seemed very restless and seemed to be wincing in pain. She also noticed his fingernails seemed a little bit long. Longer than they were a few hours before. They sit down on a large rock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark is everything all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. There's something I need to tell you. First of all I want you to know I have fallen deeply in love with you and I will never keep any secrets from you&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nor would I with you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK with that being said, there's something about me that I need to tell you and I don't mean to freak you out but....Oh hell, there's no easy way to say it, I'm a werewolf&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a werewolf. In fact I come from a long line of werewolves dating back about 250-300 years&quot;.<br />
<br />
Your mom laughs<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm serious. OK you don't believe me, let me show you.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Mark took off his coat, undid his tie and and stripped naked. Then he began to shake and twitch. He then raised his head, to reveal amber colored eyes. His skin was slick with sweat. You mom heard a cracking sound. It sounded as if all his bones were breaking, but it was Mark's spine. each vertebrae lengthening and reforming to fit a being that could walk on fours and two. His shoulder blades and hip bones snapped as they shifted into a mix of beast and man. He arched his back as the muscles expanded along with the bone. He growled and groaned, a mix of sweet pain and shear pleasure. <br />
<br />
Looking down, your mom couldn't help but notice the bones squirming and twisting beneath his skin. She kept staring as his muscles began to swell, each one becoming larger and stronger then they were before the change. The barrel of his chest widened as the rib cage shifted, his lungs becoming larger so more air could be taken in as he ran.<br />
<br />
About this time thick, reddish colored fur was poking through every pore of his body. It slowly grew as the hair on his head was getting longer, cascading down to his shoulders. He felt his feet starting to elongate. His hands and feet stretched into paws with thick leathery pads, good for running and dagger sharp claws, good for hunting .<br />
<br />
His heavy breathing was getting deeper and deeper until it became thunderous growls, his neck became thicker and muscular to match the low pitch. There was a crack like a tree snapping and then Mark's jaw bone and nose began to lengthen into a snout, his nose and lips became that of a canine, black and wet. His teeth lengthened, thickened and sharpened until they were deadly fangs.<br />
<br />
Normally your mom would run from something like Mark was becoming but she just sat there amazed and actually quite turned on. She was hoping that he would not eat her but have sex with her.<br />
<br />
Mark's face was now completely wolf, and his body a mix between man and wolf, Just then at the base of his ass, a tail sneaked out, naked and bare at first until a thick fluffy coat of red fur covered it. Mark threw his head back and howled.<br />
<br />
AAAAAAWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.<br />
<br />
You mom just looked him part of her not believing what she had just witnessed but part of her becoming very excited by what she just saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Mark, I'm sorry I didn't believe you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now you know what I am&quot;. Mark growled, his voice very deep hard to understand. &quot;I'm sure you want to run away and never see me again. All I ask is that you please don't tell anybody about my secret&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;First off Mark as long as you don't eat me, I'm not scared&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eating humans is a bunch of Hollywood bullshit. Werewolves actually can't stand the taste of human blood as most of the time we masquerade as humans even though, once we become werewolves, we are no longer human. We prefer animal blood, mostly cattle and deer&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good. Just so you know I still find you very handsome, even more so as a werewolf.&quot; she said running her fingers through Mark's fur.<br />
<br />
Mark purred softly.<br />
<br />
Then for some reason your mom impulsively asked &quot;You said you were born a werewolf. Is that the only way to become a werewolf ?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, One could be bitten or have sex with a werw...Wait a minute, Am I thinking what I think your thinking&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you are. Oh Mark I love you and I want you to change me, I want to become a werewolf and be your mate&quot;<br />
<br />
I dunno. It's not an easy life. Having to keep secrets, perhaps moving away suddenly when the animal life gets sparse, things like that. Plus what would your son say about his mom being a werewolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we'll cross that bridge when we come to it&quot; and with that your mom went down on Mark's wolf cock. Mark moaned with pleasure. This was the best blow job Mark had ever had, wolf or human. Mark could feel the wolf seed bubbling inside of him. He quickly entered your mom and with a couple of quick thrusts emptied himself inside of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god. That was fantastic. So when will I start changing&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know. I've never changed anyone before. Maybe concentrate on becoming a wolf&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mom laid there beside Mark stroking his fur thinking how awesome it would be being Mark's mate. Perhaps even having children together who might become werewolf pups. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes your mom said &quot;Oh Mark, honey I don't feel so good. I think I'm going to... OH MY GOD&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mom looked as blond fur starts growing out of her. She got her wish, She's a werewolf. <br />
<br />
Mark looks at her with joy and excitement as he has changed his first human. The changes progressed and your mom seemed to be enjoying them. She smiled as her fangs were lengthening. Her breasts were getting bigger and fuller. Her face was that of a wolf, a long thin but powerful muzzle and jaw. Her ears triangular and furry, Her tail grew out and became covered in thick blond fur, full and fluffy. It was a little painful but not as bad as she thought. <br />
 <br />
Your mom's bright amber eyes looked up at Mark, an elegant face with a beautiful muzzle enveloping him further into the instinct that already rode him. Her frame was almost regal as she stood in the moonlight, her muscles strong and lean. Her breasts were luxurious, her rear end full, Her tail thick. He felt heat flush through him.<br />
<br />
He came to her She brushed his chest with her muzzle. He nipped at her neck. He rubbed his muzzle against her chest. She intensified her own actions, her black lips pulling back and revealing her fangs as she began to bite his thick hide. He growled in pleasure, allowing his own fangs to slide out ever so slightly, and bury them lightly into her neck and shoulders. Her eyes closed and rolled back in sweet surrender, making his heart leap with ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Her mouth met his, her fangs gently taking his bottom lip and sinking in slightly making him growl once again with pleasure. He leaned into the kiss, his tongue sliding into her muzzle, her own venturing into his dangerously. She then lifted up her tail, a signal that she was in heat and she wanted him to be further into her.<br />
<br />
He growled as bliss took him over, his mind blank except for his animal instinct that told him to go more. She arched her back, muscles rolling beneath the fur as her body felt the want for even more. As Mark mounted your, his hind legs dug into the soft soil, his front claws sinking into her skin as he supported himself, every muscle tense as he made love to her.</p>
