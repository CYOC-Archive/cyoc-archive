<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An here I am hiding in an alley, naked from head to toes, running from a legion of butch women. But this <br />
probably needs some context to really convey what I'm going though. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
My name is Andrew, everyone calls me Andy. I'm a sixteen year old boy, who just had a crappy birthday. No <br />
party, no presents and recently dumped, I sulked back to my house. For my utter annoyment, but not entirely <br />
surprise, my parents had left their precious lab unnatended and apparently less important me. I might also had <br />
to explain that my parents are quite the leading experts on the realm of Quantum Physics, the genius gen of <br />
both must have destroyed each other because while I'm not a struggling student I'm not a brainiac either. <br />
After that little tangent I should continue.<br />
<br />
As I said, I was depressed and alone in my parents basement/lab on my birthday. Not the best combination, but <br />
at least I wasn't drunk or my situation could have been worse. Or I would have pass out in the lab and be <br />
scolded instead of persecuted. Who knows? Well that's exactly the kind of answer my parents occupy most of <br />
their time. They always talk of how they are &quot;like this close&quot; to actually see the other realities that could <br />
have been or are &quot;in another place&quot;. Anyway you probably wouldn't me to spell it out, buy yeah, I was upset at <br />
the time and meddle with their very sensitive equipment. The Window as they called their machine was supposed <br />
to pierce between dimension and allow a view (or a passage) between realities. How? Hey I'm not the genius <br />
that created it, just the genius that apparently make it work. And by that I mean that I pushed a bunch of <br />
buttons overcharge the machine and was hit with a blast of energy when the damn thing exploded in my face. For <br />
the moment all my thoughs were a variation of: &quot;Oh shit! My parents are going to have my ass for this!&quot;. <br />
Afterall is not everyday their son destroy invaluable, expensive and irreplaceable equipment. However I had no <br />
time to ponder that for long as I began to glow, like my skin began to glow, which only made me the more <br />
anxious. Before I knew it the glow was blinding enough to cover my whole sight. For a while.<br />
<br />
When I could see myself again I was in the middle of a street I didn't recognize. I was in a city, but at <br />
least I wasn't glowing. Being completely clueless, confused and glowing would have been to much. Or so I <br />
thought, and boy I was wrong. <br />
<br />
I will get out of the way and confirm what you must have inferred by now, and that I was to shocked to process <br />
at the time. I had jumped to another dimension. What I believe is that weird blast infuse me with whatever <br />
they're working with and that's how I ended up here. Anyway this is when I get arrested for, get this, DECENT <br />
EXPOSURE, that's not a typo. A pair of female officers saw me and inmidiately detain me, hand-cuffs and all, <br />
and they took me to the Police Station. It all happened to fast. But I distinctly recalled that all the police <br />
work was compromise of women, large strong women I have to add. What happened next, well you wont believe me <br />
if I simply told you so this is what happened:<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the meaning of this boy?&quot; asked the one of the large red heads that brought me there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know. One moment I'm in my parent's...&quot; they cut me off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marent's practice your pronunciation, boy.&quot; said another woman, odd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I need to get to them I'm sure they can explain the bright light.&quot; I tried to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bright-? What the hell are you talking about, what we want to know is where did you stole those girls <br />
clothes? Why are you wearing them, in public non the less? And why aren't you naked and erect this very <br />
second? Such disrespect to us women is punishable and we will not delay it for another second.&quot; said the <br />
policewoman.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; I expressed in utter bafflement. <br />
<br />
I will divert myself from the story to tell you an interesting factoid about animals, the hyenas to be <br />
precisely. Hyenas follow a matriarchal social structure where the male are the bottom of social scale. In fact <br />
they're even less manly than the females who's testosterone levels actually make them have a bigger <br />
pseudopenis than the males own reproductive genitals. How's that relevant? You'll see.<br />
<br />
Without delay the officer had me strip naked, and now I must confess, that I'm so very average in every way, <br />
not tall, fat, skinny, muscled, or anything. And yes I have a normal, decent size penis, which of course I was <br />
hiding from the hulking she-beast that had revoke my clothing license. But my jewels weren't safe from sight <br />
for long as a sharp stroke of a whip? made me remove my hands. I was expose before this women. And they were <br />
not done. &quot;That's better but you are not erect yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You crazy fucking bitche-&quot; I was smack in my face for all my trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's time for the punishment.&quot; said a blonde tall one. As she undid her uniform revealing a bra-less chest of <br />
what I though were C-cups, but in retrospective would be a DD, you see the size of these women could fool me. <br />
I was mesmerized and suddenly I thought of my self the protagonist of a very painful porn. And then she undid <br />
her trousers. She revealed the beast of hair he V-zone was, it even sprouted like a flower showing her <br />
interior cravings, I had her vagina mere inches from my face. &quot;Hold him.&quot; said the naked woman. And then my <br />
heart sank. Suddenly an erect member, twice as long and broad as my then deflating shaft. The other officer <br />
had already grabbed me by arms and legs, with my ass on lifted and presented as the owner of the she-penis <br />
took her place behind me. I always dreamed of losing my virginity in my sixteenth birthday, with my recent <br />
break-up I though that wasn't going to be the case. It turns out that I did lose my virginity that night. Just <br />
not the one I was hoping for.<br />
<br />
&quot;THis boy needs a reminder of who's in charge, and who's just a lowly boy.&quot; said the police officer thrusting <br />
her shaft deep into my arse. To my utter embarrasement I was hard once again, and as she continue to widen my <br />
asshole, I felt a short spark of extasis with each painful thurst. I was crying, I was leaking, I had shot my <br />
load in the middle of this room of 'officers'. Finally the blonde unsheated her beast from my anus. I was in <br />
pain and humilliation. Summoning the last of my strenght I ran away. All the officers were close so I had a <br />
clean run to the exit. I made a dash for it and left that building, I could hear them comming after me, I <br />
didn't care. I ran. I ran as fast as I can. When I saw this alley. And well that's how I ended up naked in <br />
this alley with such amazon warriors searching for me. <br />
<br />
And now it's raining. I told you it needed context to understand, not that it made sense. But now I didn't <br />
know what would happen next, would...</p>
