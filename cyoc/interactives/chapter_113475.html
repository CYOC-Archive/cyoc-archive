<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You&#39;re sure they didn&#39;t call?&quot; Frances asked as she came out the door of her office and looked into the lobby of her clinic, where Rudy was seated at his desk and handling all the things Frances expected from her secretary.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure, Doctor Twist,&quot; Rudy answered politely as he turned in his chair to look to her, &quot;I would have let you know if they&#39;d called.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances only sighed and scratched her head for a moment. Her clinic wasn&#39;t necessarily overloaded with patients, but she did have her fair share of clients that would come to see her for various reasons. Some was for professional reasons or concerns on her part, such as seeing Jen Decker to help her fully adjust to life as a widow, while some were mandated by the city as her therapy with Jennifer Harper to help her adjust to being a were and build up her self confidence as a were, and while others were simply with those who came in to see her for their own reasons, which could vary. Like all clinics, Frances was only able to keep track of this by keeping a fairly fixed schedule of appointments that would require prior notification to reschedule if there was ever a conflict of interest.  Simply not showing up didn&#39;t work well, and at present, Jennifer Harper had missed the session they were supposed to have that morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why didn&#39;t they call or show?&quot; Frances mused out loud, &quot;they&#39;ve been rather punctual with regard to being here. I think they&#39;ve even been early a couple of times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really wouldn&#39;t know Doctor Twist,&quot; Rudy answered, &quot;Perhaps something went on at the college... Something that would relate to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances sighed and nodded at that. She&#39;d been working with Jennifer Harper since Yvette Smith had been caught, found guilty, and completed Jennifer&#39;s transformation. The reasoning was due to the fact that long term incomplete periods, as Jennifer&#39;s had been, tended to cause some new weres some mental instability for a period after their transformation was completed. Frances had also found that there were some issues that related to Jenny&#39;s family and their less than perfect parenting, which she sensed could complicate anything that might trouble Jenny due with regard to adjusting to being a were. Frances felt that Jenny had been making great strides toward full mental strength and stability and fully welcome the young werevixen into were society, however, that didn&#39;t mean that they were through everything and that it was okay to not show.<br />
<br />
However, Rudy&#39;s answer raised some possibilities. Samantha had told her a bit about this second agent that was now giving himself a tour of Moon Lake that the police and the Skulk&#39;s security services were tailing fairly closely. Frances wasn&#39;t aware of the drama being played out that involved that agent&#39;s actions earlier that morning in shooting Huck and leading to his arrest just north of the Moon Lake Middle School building, but that didn&#39;t mean that she wasn&#39;t capable of assuming that this agent could have done something terrible. Dealing with issues regarding love were always touchy ones, and Frances remembered a few of her classes to become a therapist even dealt with those issues. People, weres and normals alike, could easily do things in the name of love that they wouldn&#39;t do otherwise, especially if it was taken to an unhealthy level. Such as the look Yvette carried in the showdown in the Anderson house. It looked fairly clear like she wanted to stab Martha Anderson with a kitchen knife in the hopes that William Anderson would then love her with Martha out of the way. Frances had already guessed that the fact that Dieter Wilhelm had sent TWO separate agents to Moon Lake gave an indication of an unhealthy obsession with Jennifer Harper that could very well have the perception that could turn to a &quot;if I can&#39;t have her, NO ONE can&quot; situation. That could mean that something could have happened at the college.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rudy, I&#39;m going to make a few calls, if any of my later appointments come in, please ask them to wait a few moments,&quot; Frances instructed and then turned back into her own office.<br />
<br />
Frances returned to her office and turned to her computer to look through her records on contacts and patients. She figured she&#39;d try calling Jenny first, in case whatever happened was something that distracted her from actually calling in. Once she had Jenny&#39;s cellphone number up on her screen, she pulled out her own phone and dialed the number. Frances then held the phone up and listened to it ring for a few moments. Eventually Frances heard Jenny&#39;s voice answer, which made her breathe a sigh of relief before she spoke to her missing patient.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; came Jenny&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Jenny,&quot; Frances spoke into her phone, &quot;this is Doctor Twist. Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine...&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;Is there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;as when you didn&#39;t come in for your appointment today... I got a bit concerned and wanted to contact you as a reminder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... oh man, I completely forgot about today&#39;s session,&quot; Jenny gasped, &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay and good to hear that you&#39;re okay,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;We will need to reschedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;Do you still have any time today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a little time at one,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;other than that, we&#39;d need to reschedule for next week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances then heard a heavy sigh on the other end and guessed that there probably was something that would be complicating the present situation. It left her curious as to what was going on, but she didn&#39;t know how to go about asking it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... kinda,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;apparently early this morning the guy that Dieter Wilhelm just sent here shot Harry&#39;s older brother. His name is Henry, but everyone calls him Huck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... my... is he alright?&quot; Frances asked. She didn&#39;t know Henry Jenkins Jr., but that didn&#39;t mean she wanted anyone to get hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... the doctor just told us that he&#39;ll recover,&quot; Jenny answered them, &quot;but for the moment we need to wait for awhile before we can go in to see him. I think they&#39;re moving him from the operating room to a room in the ICU.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;So I take it you will be with Harry for the day to deal with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;we could manage a late afternoon appointment but we wouldn&#39;t have the time for a morning or early afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... well my schedule for today outside of the opening that I told you of is pretty full,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;We&#39;ll just have to move this one back into next week. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Jenny replied, &quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>
