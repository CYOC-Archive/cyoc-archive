<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff felt his father pull out of his wife&#39;s butt, out of him. Jeff&#39;s mouth closed up, but he felt wrong and not just because his father was just...in him. Suddenly Jeff was flipped upside down as his mother rolled over in bed. She grabbed both of her legs and pulled them over her head. Jeff felt as though he was going to puke when suddenly he puked up the still hot semen. The white fluid dribbled out of his tight, puckered lips as it ran down to the sheets underneath her. Jeff&#39;s parents looked into each other&#39;s eyes until his father spoke. Was that as good for you as it was for me?&quot; He asked with a sly grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;That felt so good, you just can&#39;t know, hon,&quot; Answered Jeff&#39;s mother as she lowered her legs, &quot;You must really love this big ol&#39; booty, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Girl you know I do!&quot; Replied Jeff&#39;s father. The mother laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well as much as I loved that that, don&#39;t you think we should get out of bed now? Kid&#39;s will be up soon.&quot; Said Jeff&#39;s mother. She rolled off the bed and headed towards the bathroom, still naked, while Jeff&#39;s dad went downstairs to cook something to eat. Once in the bathroom, Jeff&#39;s mother wasted no time in starting her shower. Once the water was hot enough she jumped in and started lathering her dark hair with shampoo.<br />
<br />
While his mother cleaned her body, Jeff took the time reflect on his current situation. It did not seem real. Jeff had for years harbored the fantasy of one day being dominated by a beautiful woman. It was weird for sure and maybe even a little demented, it went further than a simple dominatrix or humiliation obsession. He wanted to be used up, consumed. He wanted the woman - whoever she was - to take everything; He wanted her to devour him in mind body and soul. That would be the ultimate domination. To be used up so completely until not even his flesh remained. <br />
<br />
He did not care who she was, the fact that he chose to sacrifice himself to his own mother mattered little, and there was a sort of poetry for him to rejoin the body he had birthed him. Besides that, she definitely fit the bill in all in all respects. She was beautiful, ravishingly so, with a body that look as though Goddess Aphrodite sculpted her with her own two hands. As a woman of 40 years with a son and daughter, Jeff&#39;s mother still possessed a youthfulness that managed to turn heads when ever she walked down the street. The eyes of every man the raven haired mother passed would hone in on her ample chest, or great, round ass. Her ass. Jeff remembered the first time he noticed his mother&#39;s shapely behind. He was twelve or thirteen when he walked in on his mother and a couple of her friends practicing yoga in his family&#39;s living room. The imaged had burned itself into his memory just as he had begun to enter puberty. The way it wobbled and bounced in the air, its roundness and girth, the taught, sheer material of her yoga pants wrapped around its every contour and crevice. Jeff remembered thinking how he just wanted to swan dive right between her two perfectly sculpted buttocks and never come out. He now realized that forgotten moment had subconsciously influenced his choice in person and their anatomy when he selected his transformation options.<br />
<br />
It was if fate itself had arranged for events to play out as they had. As if he had glimpsed his future destiny all those years ago that day in his living room. For that was where he now found himself, snugly nestled between his mother&#39;s rotund butt cheeks and he was her tight, pink little anus hidden away between them. His fantasy has pretty much come true. He knew he should be feeling horrified, disgusted with his actions and their outcome, but even after enduring his mother&#39;s earlier bowel movement, and his father&#39;s later penetration and ejaculation, neither of which he much cared to experience again anytime soon, Jeff could not help butt feel nothing but a sense of excitement, and admittedly a slight bit of shame.<br />
<br />
As Jeff&#39;s mother continued her shower it suddenly donned on him that in his hurry he never set a time limit for his transformation. Did he even see the option? A pang of worry suddenly came over him and a multitude of questions. What would happen? Would he simply revert back to his old self after some predetermined amount of time had elapsed? How long would that be? Would he even change back? Jeff thought about it for a while and was surprised that he would not mind that. It admittedly would not be the most ideal situation, he was young and still wanted to do a lot of things: find a girlfriend and finally lose his virginity, travel the world and go on an adventure, maybe one day start a family. None of these things could be done as a sentient butt hole, true, but there was an odd contentment felt when he thought about living out the rest of his days between his mother&#39;s thick, plump buttocks. Such as he was he would no longer have any responsibilities or expectations placed upon him. No debts. There was the inevitable expulsion of his mom’s flatulence and feces of course, and though he was not eager to experience it again, he had already gone through both scenarios and the taste left on his lips, though not pleasant, was not as bad as he thought it should be. He could learn to tolerate it. <br />
<br />
Besides that Jeff no longer had to worry about such trivial things as eating, drinking, or even breathing. His maternal figure would sustain him as he was now just a part of her body, that included her circulatory system as well. At this very moment his mother&#39;s blood coursed through him, replacing his own. As long as his mother continued to breathe and regularly attain nourishment from food and drink they would both stay alive. Their lives were now intertwined. Jeff apparently still could sleep though as he was not awake until his mother had farted earlier. All in all he had a sense of security. Jeff was tucked away from the outside world and nestled between his mom&#39;s plump buttocks where nothing could reach him. Jeff felt cozy. Safe. For now he decided to wait until he crossed that bridge. If he had to remain as his mother&#39;s asshole. So be it. Not the worst existence. <br />
<br />
He could not believe how blasé he was being about everything. Jeff wondered if the Chronivac was effecting his mind, when suddenly he was brought out of his thoughts when his puckered form suddenly seized up. Before he had a chance to process what was happening his puckered lips twitched a couple times before they parted. Jeff&#39;s mother, unaware of his presence, passed possibly the worst smelling fart through her former son that either of them had smelled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whew!&quot; Exclaimed Jeff&#39;s mother from above. &quot;That’s a stinky Mexican food fart if I’ve ever smelled one.” She groaned. Jeff would agree as the taste of his mother&#39;s gas lingered on his lips. Amidst the oppressive earthy stench were notes of fermented pumpkins, meat, chili peppers, and spices that made his lips tingle.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s mother returned to her shower and resigned himself to simply sit and enjoy the quiet as he basked in his mother&#39;s warmth. If he never reverted back, the main regret would be the heartbreak he would bring his family. No one knew what he had done. To his parents and sister it would seem as though he just vanished. No one would ever think about searching for him between his mother&#39;s butt cheeks, even if they did they would not see anything out of the ordinary. Jeff was now a his mother&#39;s little but thole, and looked like one with no discernible features that would show that he had once been a person. All they would see would be a taut, pink anus, maybe Jeff&#39;s father would notice that his wife&#39;s butt hole looked a little too pristine and youthful than before, but he would never guess it was because his teenage son had replaced it. Just then Jeff&#39;s world shifted slightly. He could not see what happened, but he can tell that his mother had bent over. Her buttocks were now parted ever so slightly, allowing a small sliver of light to enter the cleft of her large rear, illuminating the dark, humid interior of her butt crack which her son was now part of. The smooth walls of her buttocks seemed to extend meters in all directions giving Jeff the impression that he was stuck at the bottom of a deep, moist, odorous, canyon. Jeff now had a narrow glimpse of the world outside his mother&#39;s ass. It seemed so far away, so different now. His mother had a rather large behind, this Jeff knew, but it seem that much bigger from between her cheeks. He did not have the best view, all he could see was one of the beige walls in the the bathroom. The immense, fleshy, light tan protuberances at either side of Jeff filled much of his field of vision.<br />
<br />
With his very limited range of movement, Jeff managed to shift his gaze downward, until he could see your his mother&#39;s tight, shaven vulva right below. He was totally enveloped by the heat of her body, and a substantial amount of it radiated from her womanhood. Jeff&#39;s mother&#39;s womanly aroma also wafted up to him and mixed with the stink of his surroundings. The scent was...not entirely unpleasant. Through the tiny space at the base of his mother&#39;s crack he could just see the backs of her thick thighs, and long, shapely legs. It appeared as though he was suspended a dozen meters above the ground. Then suddenly she stood up straight and her enormous hams came together and plunged her new anus into darkness once again.<br />
<br />
In a morbid kind of way Jeff found it all sort of comforting. He were happy to finally be getting cleaned up. The hot water trickled down through his mother - turned - owner&#39;s butt-crack, and it felt like heaven when it washed over him, rinsing away some of the filth that coated his him. The bathroom was silent save for the sound of the water spraying out of the shower nozzle, and the cheerful melody being hummed by Jeff&#39;s host. It was an oddly comforting tune that put Jeff&#39;s mind at ease, like a lullaby she would sing when he was a baby. <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s mother finished her shower and stepped out of the tub. She toweled off and spent sometime in the mirror before she decided to exit the bathroom and return to her bedroom to find something to wear. Jeff twitched in anticipation between his mother&#39;s bouncing butt cheeks, exited for what lie ahead.</p>
