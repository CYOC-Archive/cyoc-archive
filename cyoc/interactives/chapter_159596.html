<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After rushing down into her room, Brin quickly locked the door, put the medallion she stole on her bed and started searching the upper shelves of her wardrobe.<br />
Many of the clothes that were now unused by her family were kept in those shelves.<br />
It usually just added salt to Brin’s injuries, seeing all the clothes and shoes far too big on her that her sister Gina has long outgrown, but now, they were her arsenal.<br />
<br />
After looking for a bit, she found what she was looking for: a pair of shoes that was too big for Gina.<br />
Her family has to specially order shoes for Gina over the internet, and due to the time it takes until the shoes get delivered, they ordered multiple pairs of sports shoes at increasingly larger sizes in preparation for her expected continuation of her growth, with quite possibly an overkill.<br />
Said overkill is what Brin has taken, with plenty of excitement. She was going to stop being the “short runt”.<br />
<br />
Taking the shoes out of the box and the medallion from the bed and holding them together, she felt a shock, fell down and dropped both the shoes and the amulet to the ground.<br />
<br />
After standing back up, all her body tingled, but otherwise, nothing else felt different.<br />
Feeling a bit disappointed, she sat down and waited.<br />
<br />
A few minutes have passed, and her limbs ached and looked longer, which made her very excited as she stood up.<br />
She was definitely taller now, well over five feet, though still bellow five and a half. But she was still growing, so she waited.<br />
<br />
Now standing up, she saw the furniture in her room get lower and lower while the shoes she was currently wearing started to dig through her skin until she had to much and after some struggling, she took them and the overstretched socks off.<br />
Comparing her feet to her old shoes, they were certainly too big for them now. They were now far longer than the soles of the shoes, and they looked like they were still growing!<br />
<br />
A few more minutes and Brin reached the six foot mark and her pants started killing her. Pulling them down, it revealed a wider hips and thicker thighs that were a part of a long pair of legs. They were actually getting to similar proportions to those of Gina, as if the experienced a similar puberty.<br />
Proving that assumption, her shirt, who now exposed her stomach, was also pushed forward by two small mounds of developing breasts.<br />
To keep her lower body covered, Brin took some of Gina’s ‘newest’ old shorts that she recently outgrew from the top shelves of her wardrobe, who was now far easier to reach.<br />
They left some empty room, but they were good enough.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, there was a loud knock on her door. “Brin, open the door right now or I’ll make your shrimpy ass regret the day it was born!” Came booming in Gina’s voice.<br />
‘Seems like Gina and that boy switched back’ though Brin. ‘But she got the shrimp part wrong’.<br />
<br />
With a surprising amount of bravery, Brin hid the medallion deep inside her closet and opened the door, to look slightly up at her sister.<br />
<br />
Gina, back in her old body, looked down in expectation, met a budding pair breasts in front of her, and then looked back up in surprise to see her sister only slightly shorter than herself. Brin still looked like her old self, only as if puberty hadn’t abandoned her.<br />
Jake, who was next to Gina in his own old body, was looking down only to quickly look back up and up and up until he saw Gina’s little sister’s face, slowly inching up.<br />
<br />
After a moment of silent shock, Brin broke the silence.<br />
“Who are you calling shrimp?” she said teasingly, now the same height as her sister.<br />
“Brin, you little... eh, you fucking rat!” said Gina, filled with anger yet correcting her confused self mid sentence. “You ruined it! Jake and I were supposed to change back without a hassle and then YOU ruined it! How are you going to explain it to mom and dad? Bring the medallion back!”<br />
“What are you going to do? Force me to do it?” replied Brin teasingly with increasing confidence. “You don’t have the size advantage like before”<br />
<br />
Gina suddenly grabbed Brin, pulled her and then pinned her towards the wall, using her stronger, more athletic body to do so, but it was much harder than in the past, and getting more and more difficult by the second.<br />
<br />
“I was tired you constantly teasing me about being short and underdeveloped, I saw an opposition and couldn’t let it go” said the pinned Brin. “I guess I’ll have to explain mom and dad what happened, because it’s too late to change back now. You said you could change only once every twelve hours, so if I would change back, which I won’t, it will have to be tomorrow”<br />
<br />
After calming a bit down and struggling to pin her too much, Gina let go of Brin, and said “As much as I hate it, you are right. You can’t change back now, and we’ll have to tell mom and dad what happened if they see you, but the moment you can change back, you will do that.<br />
<br />
“I think I would stay like that, LITTLE sister, and I don’t think you could force me otherwise” said Brin as she stood up to her full height, over half a foot taller than her older, 6’5”, sister.</p>
