<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brotyn felt something stirring deep within him. It was as if the very fabric of his existence was being rewritten, reshaped by an unseen hand. The room around him began to distort, the furniture stretching and twisting to accommodate his growing form. His chest expanded outward, the scales of a dragon replacing the soft flesh of his human torso. His shoulders grew broader, and his neck elongated, giving him the proud stature of a creature that once ruled the skies.<br />
<br />
His shirt changed to a sleeveless leather vest that hugged his new muscular form. He looked down and noticed his once smooth skin was now covered in red scales that shimmered in the light. His jeans had been replaced with a pair of rugged shorts made of the same leather, leaving his powerful dragon legs bare.<br />
<br />
Brotyn, not seeing anything different about his reflection, went about his day as he normally would. He felt a newfound strength in his limbs and a strange, unexplained confidence. As he walked through the halls of his house, his heavy footsteps echoed, the sound of a strange mix of human and beast.<br />
<br />
Holes opened up on the back of his vest. Two large wings unfurled from his back, each one covered in the same crimson scales as his body. They stretched and flexed, the leathery material straining against the new muscles beneath.<br />
<br />
His neck grew longer, and the scales on his body grew denser and tougher. His eyes, once a soft brown, had transformed into piercing slits of gold, filled with ancient wisdom and a hint of mischief. Despite these changes, Brotyn went about his day as if it were any other day.<br />
<br />
He strutted through the house, feeling the power that surged through his veins. The furniture had shifted and reformed around him, his tail swishing back and forth as he moved. He was unaware of the changes happening to him, but they felt natural, like a second skin he had been born to wear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to hit the gym,&quot; he announced to the empty house, his deepened voice reverberating off the walls. As he walked, his legs grew longer and more powerful, the muscles beneath the red scales flexing with each step. His hands had changed into large, clawed paws that still had the dexterity to text and play games on his phone. He couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of pride in his newfound strength as he swiped through his social media feeds, seeing the same mundane posts from his friends.<br />
<br />
His height was now over 7 feet tall. His head and hair change to a shade of red. The scales grew on his head as it shifted to a dragon&#39;s skull. His teeth had become sharp and pointed. His eyes had changed to a deep sapphire blue. His hair had turned into a mane that ran down his spine, the same color as his scales.<br />
<br />
Brotyn went to the fridge to grab a snack, his tail swiping the floor as he passed, knocking over a vase. He barely noticed his focus solely on the food. The fridge was now taller, and he had to lean down to see inside. He grabbed a pack of turkey slices and a bottle of water. His teeth had sharpened, making it easy to tear into the plastic like it was paper. He chewed the meat, feeling the texture change in his mouth, now filled with pointed teeth. His tongue had become more sensitive, tasting flavors with a new depth. The water was cool and refreshing, sliding down his dragon&#39;s throat with ease.<br />
<br />
Now over 8 feet tall, Brotyn went to his room to grab his phone. He noticed that his door was slightly smaller, but he shrugged it off as his imagination was playing tricks on him. His room had changed drastically since the curse had taken hold. Where once there were posters of boy bands and celebrities, there were now intricate tapestries depicting scenes of ancient battles between dragons and knights.<br />
<br />
The floor was now a mosaic of various woods, each piece carefully laid out to form a scale pattern. His bed had transformed into a large, comfortable stone slab with a plush velvet cover, which somehow accommodated his growing size. He reached for his phone, his clawed fingers deftly navigating the device&#39;s screen. He sent a text to Himesh, using &#39;he&#39; in the message without a second thought.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hey, what&#39;s up?&#39; he typed, his thumbs moving with surprising ease considering the new shape of his hands. The phone vibrated in his grasp, and he saw Himesh had responded almost immediately.<br />
<br />
&#39;Not much, you?&#39; came the reply.<br />
<br />
Brotyn didn&#39;t think much of it as he responded, his thumbs flying over the keyboard. He was used to Himesh&#39;s quick replies, but something felt off. His eyes darted around the room, noticing the shadows playing tricks on the walls. The light from the window painted a flickering pattern on the floor, and he felt his heart race for a moment. Shaking his head, he attributed it to his vivid imagination. The day had started like any other, with him lounging on his bed and scrolling through social media. Yet, everything seemed a bit more... intense. The colors of the screen were brighter, and the sounds of the house were clearer than ever before.<br />
<br />
Brotyn&#39;s fingers hovered over the keys, pausing for a moment as the feeling of unease grew stronger. He looked around the room, his eyes lingering on the carvings that adorned the space. There were sculptures of various sizes, from intricately carved pencils that resembled miniature kitty cats to life-sized statues of male and female dragons with meticulously detailed genitalia standing proudly at his bedposts. The carvings were a mix of materials: some were made of wood, others of stone, and a few were even crafted from metal. Each one was a testament to his newfound artistic prowess and passion.<br />
<br />
But it was the smell of something burning that brought him back to reality. He looked down to find his nose had grown larger and more snout-like, with two slits that now served as nostrils. And from these nostrils, smoke began to billow. The scent of the smoke was faintly metallic, hinting at the power within him that was slowly bubbling to the surface. The smoke grew denser and hotter as his arousal grew. It was a strange sensation, one that both excited and unnerved him.<br />
<br />
As he lay on the obsidian bed, the sheets feeling cool and smooth against his new scales, he couldn&#39;t help but let his curiosity get the better of him. He reached down with his large, clawed hand and began to explore the changes between his legs. His cock had grown thick and hard, the shaft covered in the same red scales that adorned his tail. The tip was a vibrant shade of blue and the barbs that lined the underside felt like they were pulsing with energy. His balls had become larger, hanging low and heavy beneath him, and they too were covered in a fine dusting of red scales.<br />
<br />
He pulls down his shorts and stares at his new appendages in awe. His cock is now a thick, meaty thing, the size of a small baseball bat and just as hard. His balls are like two heavy grapefruits, and they hang low between his muscular thighs. The red scales that cover them seem to pulse with every heartbeat, and he can feel the warmth emanating from his crotch. He gently takes hold of his cock, feeling the smooth scales slide under his palm. The sensation sends a jolt of pleasure up his spine, and he can&#39;t help but let out a low growl.<br />
<br />
The room feels like it&#39;s getting hotter, and he notices that his vision has become more intense. The colors are brighter, and he can see every detail on the walls. His nostrils flare as he picks up the scent of his arousal. It&#39;s a mix of metal and something primal, something that makes his stomach churn with excitement. He starts to stroke himself, the barbs along the shaft catching on his claws and sending shivers through his body.<br />
<br />
As he gets closer to climax, his tail starts to thump against the floor, the sound echoing through the room like a drum. His body tenses up, and his scales start to feel like they&#39;re tightening around him, like a second skin that&#39;s trying to hold in the power that&#39;s building inside. He throws his head back and roars as he cums, the sound so loud that it seems to shake the very foundation of the house.<br />
<br />
His cock shoots thick globs of his seed onto the walls and ceiling. As he does, his eyes flash with a fiery red light. Suddenly, a gout of flame erupts from his mouth, the heat intense enough to scorch the paint and leave a trail of charred wood in its wake. The fire spreads, licking the ceiling and painting the walls with flickering shadows.<br />
<br />
The ceiling changes as he looks at it. The smooth plaster was replaced by a mural of the night sky. Stars and a full moon glowed on the ceiling. He realized that magic of some kind was changing it. He didn&#39;t know why but he had a feeling it was related to him. He decided to ignore it for now and went about his day.<br />
<br />
His nose twitched as he smelled the faint scent of magic in the air. It was a metallic, almost electric scent that tickled his new dragon nostrils. Noon has arrived, and with it, the sun shone through his bedroom window, casting shadows of his new form onto the floor. The light danced off his scales, creating a mesmerizing pattern that he couldn&#39;t help but admire.<br />
<br />
He rose from his bed, feeling more alive and powerful than ever. His new dragon form had settled, and the magic of his transformation had fully integrated with the fabric of his reality. The house around him felt more like a lair, each crevice and corner holding secrets and potential.<br />
<br />
The day ahead was filled with anticipation for the night&#39;s party, which was to be a masquerade ball at Ake&#39;s mansion. The invitations had been sent out, and Brotyn could feel the excitement building. He decided to make the most of his day by exploring the limits of his new body.<br />
<br />
First, he had to navigate the house. The once-familiar layout now seemed designed to accommodate his larger frame and tail. The furniture had shifted slightly, the couch now a perfect lounge for his dragon-like form, and the counters had risen just enough to be at the right height for his new elongated neck. His mother had even stocked the fridge with meals that were surprisingly satisfying to his carnivorous cravings.<br />
<br />
Next, Brotyn decided to take a stroll outside. The cool breeze caressed his scales, bringing with it the scent of distant fires and the promise of adventure. His tail swished back and forth as he stepped out into the bright sunlight, his eyes narrowing to slits as they adjusted to the glare. The neighborhood children had always been fascinated by his family&#39;s oddities, but today, something was different.<br />
<br />
Looking at a statue he had done he saw something odd. It was of a mammoth. The sculpture had wisps of magic wafting off it. Looking down he saw the wisps wafting off of him. However it was less, and both were getting fainter over time. He was about to go inside to test something when his phone rang.<br />
<br />
It was Himesh. &quot;Hey Ake, what&#39;s up?&quot; Brotyn said. &quot;I had a weird dream, and now I&#39;m feeling weird. Like something&#39;s missing&quot; Himesh replied. &quot;you too huh?&quot; he said. &quot;yeah, I don&#39;t know why though. Maybe it&#39;s just stress from the party tonight?&quot; Himesh suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;let&#39;s call the others and see if they had the same dream,&quot; Brotyn suggested. He dialed the numbers to reach the other two, and soon they were all on a group call. Dever, the monkey hybrid, was the first to pick up. His deep, resonant voice filled the line as he greeted them.<br />
<br />
&quot;no I haven&#39;t felt any different, but I had a weird dream last night,&quot; Dever said, his new monkey features twitching slightly as he talked. &quot;it was like I was in the middle of the jungle, surrounded by animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brotyn nodded, his dragon tail swishing behind him as he listened intently. &quot;I had a dream like that too, but I was in the sky with a bunch of mythical creatures,&quot; he shared. &quot;it felt... powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aakesh, chimed in next. His voice was a rich baritone. &quot;My dream was filled with animals too, but it was more of a zoo than a jungle or sky,&quot; he said, his elephant-like trunk curling around his phone to keep it steady. &quot;But I feel fine, maybe it&#39;s just our minds playing tricks on us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brotyn couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something more was happening, but he didn&#39;t want to worry his friends. &quot;Yeah, probably just stress,&quot; he agreed, trying to sound more casual than he felt. &quot;I&#39;ve got a lot to do before the party anyway, so let&#39;s just focus on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hanging up, he stretched out his new, powerful arms and flexed his dragon-like muscles. His day at home was filled with a mix of human chores and dragon-like behavior. He found that his heightened agility and strength allowed him to do tasks with an ease he never knew before. He had to remind himself to use his hands instead of his tail when navigating his room. His mother&#39;s art supplies had been transformed into a treasure trove of materials for his sculptures, which now looked more lifelike than ever. He spent the afternoon crafting, feeling a strange connection to the dragons he carved from the wooden blocks as if they were kin.<br />
<br />
When hunger struck, Brotyn&#39;s taste buds craved something more substantial than his usual fare. He rummaged through the fridge with his long claws, his height allowing him to reach items that once required a chair. He pulled out a steak, his teeth growing sharp and serrated as his mouth watered. Cooking it over the stove, the smell of sizzling meat filled the house. With a flick of his forked tongue, he could taste the delicious flavors wafting in the air. The steak was gone in a matter of minutes, and the meat barely cooked as his dragon instincts took over.<br />
<br />
With the party approaching, Brotyn had to choose his outfit. He settled on a sleek, custom-tailored suit made of the finest dragon-scale fabric. It was a deep crimson color that matched his new scales perfectly. The suit hugged his muscular frame, emphasizing his broad shoulders and powerful chest. His tail slipped into a special slot in the back of his pants, allowing it to wag freely without causing a scene.<br />
<br />
Spreading his wings he took flight. The wind rushed through his scales. He felt like a king. This was something he had never felt before. He could feel the heat coming from his body as he flew over the city. The city lights looked like stars compared to his glow.<br />
<br />
&#39;wait?!&#39; Brotyn thought, &#39;I&#39;ve always flown to places, haven&#39;t I?&#39; the confusion came again but was pushed aside by excitement. He had never felt so alive and powerful. He flew over the city, his eyes scanning for any landmarks that could lead him to Ake&#39;s mansion. The journey was exhilarating. He felt like he was in a video game, navigating through skyscrapers and over the river.<br />
<br />
Finally, the massive mansion came into view. The lights from the party were so bright it could be seen from miles away. Brotyn swooped down, his wings folding back as he touched the ground. The sound of his landing caused a minor earthquake. He strutted up to the front door, his tail swishing side to side like a peacock. He knocked with his clawed hand, the sound echoing through the grand entrance.<br />
<br />
The door swung open, revealing a butler dressed in a tuxedo. His eyes widened at the sight of Brotyn, but he quickly composed himself and announced, &quot;Mr. Brotyn, welcome to the masquerade.&quot; Brotyn stepped into the grand hall, his clawed feet clicking against the marble floor. The room was filled with elegance, the air thick with the scent of expensive perfumes and the chatter of the elite. Yet, he felt utterly at home, his dragon spirit reveling in the grandeur.<br />
<br />
Brotyn&#39;s heart raced as he surveyed the party, his gold-tinted eyes sparkling with excitement. He felt every beat of the bass from the music in his very core, his dragon instincts heightened. He noticed the glances from the other guests, some intrigued, others fearful. He knew that as an anthro dragon, he was an uncommon sight, but that didn&#39;t dampen his spirits.<br />
<br />
With a roaring laugh, Brotyn threw his head back, letting out a small burst of flame. It was a small show of his power, and the crowd gasped before breaking into applause. He felt the thrill of being the center of attention, his ego-inflating with every cheer. His friends found him in the grand ballroom, the floor trembling slightly with every step he took. His tail swished behind him, knocking over a few expensive-looking vases.<br />
<br />
&quot;hey, dude&quot; Brotyn heard his friend Dever approach him. His heart skipped a beat as he recognized the monkey anthro&#39;s voice. &quot;how&#39;s the party?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dever was dressed in a fancy tuxedo that somehow didn&#39;t seem out of place on his hairy body. His tail was curled around his waist, holding his bow tie in place. &quot;It&#39;s pretty wild, man. You&#39;ve got to check out the buffet,&quot; Dever said with a grin, gesturing towards a table laden with food.<br />
<br />
The three of them approached, the music and laughter of the masquerade party swelling around them. The room was alive with the vibrant colors of the decorations and the flash of cameras as the attendees snapped pictures of each other&#39;s elaborate costumes. The aroma of exotic dishes filled the air, making Brotyn&#39;s mouth water. He looked over to see what Ake had prepared for the evening&#39;s feast.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all for us,&quot; Dever whispered, leaning in closer. &quot;Ake had the caterers make everything we could want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brotyn&#39;s eyes widened at the sight of the buffet. It was a smorgasbord of meats, fruits, and vegetables, all arranged in a way that was both artful and alluring. His new dragon instincts kicked in, and he could smell the freshness of the food from across the room. His stomach rumbled, and he couldn&#39;t resist the urge to indulge. He picked up a whole roast chicken with his teeth, tearing into the flesh with a ferocity that made the other guests gasp.<br />
<br />
The four friends mingled through the masquerade, their forms drawing a mix of intrigue and awe from the masked guests. Ake, the elephant anthro, had outdone himself with the party&#39;s grandeur. The chandeliers shimmered with an ethereal light that danced across the marble floors, and the air was thick with the scent of exotic flowers and spices. The music was a fusion of classical and tribal beats, setting a lively mood that resonated with the animal spirits within them.<br />
<br />
Dever, the mischievous monkey anthro, couldn&#39;t resist the temptation to play a prank. He snuck behind a group of unsuspecting humans, his tail twitching with glee, and released a loud fart-like sound. The humans, unable to detect the source, glanced around confused, while Brotyn and Himesh roared with laughter, their chests rumbling like thunder. Dever&#39;s cheeks puffed out in a grin, revealing his sharp teeth, as he swung away on the velvet drapes that hung from the ceiling, his nimble feet never touching the ground.<br />
<br />
Himesh, the goat anthro, felt his mystical aura pulsing stronger than ever before. He had spent the past few days delving into his newfound powers, he waved his hand and hit a guest with a minor curse. She was the head of the cheerleaders who had been repulsed by the four.<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s eyes bulged as her hair grew out, turning into thick, golden locks that cascaded down to her waist. She felt a strange heat in her loins as her body began to shift. The crowd watched in amazement as she grew a penis. Her once beautiful dress now hugged her new, muscular form.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is happening to me?&quot; she whispered to herself, though it was clear the transformation was complete. The partygoers gawked and whispered, but Himesh&#39;s new confidence shone through. He strutted over to the snack table, his hooves clicking on the marble floor, and picked up a tray of cheese and crackers. His nose had lengthened into a muzzle, and his teeth had sharpened. The transformation was exhilarating, and he couldn&#39;t wait to see the look on the cheerleader&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Ake, now a towering elephant anthro, felt his heart pounding in his massive chest as he surveyed the dignified party. His trunk twitched with excitement as he took in the smells of the delicious food and the delightful company. He had always loved showing off his strength, and this new form was no exception. The teen boy felt a strange mix of pride and power as he flexed his muscles, which now rippled beneath his thick grey skin.<br />
<br />
Moving through the crowded room with surprising grace, Ake couldn&#39;t help but show off. He playfully lifted a small table with his trunk, the porcelain plates and silverware clinking together as they hovered in the air. His mother had always encouraged him to be polite and respectful of others, but the elephant inside of him was eager to play. He set the table down gently, the crowd erupting into applause and laughter.<br />
<br />
Brotyn, now fully embracing his anthro dragon form, couldn&#39;t help but feel the energy of the masquerade party pulsing through him. His tail swished back and forth as he navigated through the crowd, his newfound height and confidence giving him an air of authority that none of the guests could ignore. The room was alive with whispers and stares, but he didn&#39;t care; he had always been the center of attention, and now he had the power to demand it.<br />
<br />
He felt a strange mix of emotions—excitement and pride at the admiration in everyone&#39;s eyes, and a hint of greed as he eyed the lavish spread of food laid out on the banquet table. The dragon in him craved rich, meaty flavors, and he found himself piling his plate higher than anyone else&#39;s. His gold eyes glinted in the candlelight as he picked out the choicest cuts of roast beef and turkey legs, his sharp teeth tearing into the flesh with relish.<br />
<br />
As he mingled with the partygoers, his tail swished back and forth, knocking over a few glasses of punch here and there. He didn&#39;t mean to cause a scene, but the dragon in him was too eager to show off its strength. Each time he saw a pretty girl, he&#39;d flex his muscles, the scales on his arms glinting like jewels, hoping to catch her eye. It wasn&#39;t just the food he was greedy for—it was the attention, the power, the thrill of being something more than just an average teenage boy.<br />
<br />
But even amidst the laughter and the cheers, Brotyn couldn&#39;t shake off the feeling that something wasn&#39;t quite right. He glanced around the room, searching for the source of his unease. His eyes landed on the mirrors that adorned the walls, and for a brief moment, he swore he saw the fat guy they had mocked at the mall glaring back at him. He blinked and the image was gone, replaced by his reflection.<br />
<br />
Akius watched from the shadows, his heart racing. The transformation of the four girls into their spirit animals had taken a life of its own, and it was spiraling out of his control. He had never meant for this to happen, but his anger had fueled a power within him that was now unraveling the very fabric of their lives.<br />
<br />
The wizard&#39;s gaze shifted from one transformed teen to the next. He had hoped to teach them a lesson, to make them feel the way he felt when they had laughed at him. But instead, he had given them gifts they didn&#39;t even realize were curses. Their new forms brought them power and respect, not the ridicule he had so desperately sought to inflict.<br />
<br />
He...</p>
