<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David woke up, yawned, and stretched. Lastly he scratched at his lhower belly, fingers ruffling through the hair trailing down from his belly button to the base of his cock. It was a shorter trail for him than most men - due to his massive size, his cock sat higher up on his belly to make room for the base. <br />
<br />
With a sigh, he slid out of bed, careful to hold his balls and cock up so he wouldn&#39;t accidentally crush them with his legs as he swung them off the side of the bed. Before he stood, he let them down gently. He&#39;d learned the hard away that if he let either of them just drop, the sudden pull of flesh would be almost cripplingly painful.<br />
<br />
He opened his bedroom door, making sure nobody was in the hallway before he walked naked into the bathroom for his morning shower. <br />
<br />
David waited to pee until he was in the shower itself; he&#39;d learned the hard way that it was just easier to pee down the shower drain, guiding the head of his cock over the drain like a pendulum, than it would be to pee in the toilet. Bonus, he could wash himself at the same time, so it was like he was killing two birds with one stone. <br />
<br />
After the shower he looked himself in the full-length mirror on the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
Overall, he wasn&#39;t unattractive. Dark hair that waved just a little, a defined jaw. His body was lean, but not super muscular. The only exception were his legs and core, which were corded with hard muscularity, formed from years of supporting heavy weight.<br />
<br />
Namely, his cock. <br />
<br />
Oh, his balls were also big, having finally caught up to his penis over the past couple years. But his cock... Long and thick, soft it hung halfway down his calves, and was a little thicker than a two liter soda bottle. It hung over his balls, each the size of grapefruits and hung low between his thighs.<br />
<br />
He toweled off and finished getting ready for the day, brushing teeth, shaving his peach fuzz, etc. With another check, he crossed back to his bedroom and picked out his clothes for the day. <br />
<br />
He had to go to school, so he slipped on a t-shirt with a game logo on it, and carefully stepped in to a pair of boxers and jeans. He had to pull them up halfway up his thighs first before sliding his cock down one leg hole, then cradle his balls in the crotch before securing them around his waist. All of his pants and underwear were modified to have a larger crotch pouch, otherwise they&#39;d pull down and away and not cover much of anything. Even so, he had a huge bulge in the front of his jeans and his cock was barely able to squeeze in next to his leg in the jeans.<br />
<br />
David sighed. His cock and balls were uncomfortably squeezed - he would need a new pair soon. He had hoped his growth would have slowed down, but he couldn&#39;t be that lucky. <br />
<br />
He packed up his swimsuit and gym clothes, both tailored to keep him from flopping out, and his gym clothes even provided some compression to keep everything contained. They weren&#39;t perfect, and he still had trouble with most sorts of cardio considering he&#39;d bounce and flop everywhere, but they helped keep him in shape without worrying about getting arrested for public indecency.<br />
<br />
Done getting ready for school, David headed towards the kitchen where his mom was cooking breakfast. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, spotting him enter. David couldn&#39;t help but see the way her eyes glanced down at his bulge and then back up. He couldn&#39;t blame her - everyone had that reaction when he first walks into a room. &quot;You&#39;re up early.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking I might head to the gym or pool before school starts,&quot; he said, taking a seat at the table. He winced when he pushed his chair up - the bulge in his lap was high enough that it was squished between his legs and the bottom of the table. He spread his knees wide as he could in order to help make some room.<br />
<br />
&quot;In that case,&quot; his mom said, sliding a plate in front of him. &quot;You better eat up and have plenty of energy.&quot; She made eggs and... Sausage. Of course. <br />
<br />
David inhaled the food ravenously anyway and got up to leave for school. He checked the time as he went.<br />
<br />
He left early enough that no matter what he did he&#39;d have enough time to finish up before class. <br />
<br />
He decided he would...</p>
