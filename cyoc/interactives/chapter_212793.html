<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The conversation with Melody was intriguing, and Jeff had found himself learning a lot about things that related to Slug People as a society and Melody, specifically. A lot of it had been helpful with regard to dealing with Cupple, who he had the sense had something sinister beyond merely breeding large numbers of Slug People to serve as enslaved familiars for wizards. He didn&#39;t fully remember the interactions that Cupple had had with the Chapman family at his father&#39;s funeral, but the interactions had after his own transformation into a Slug Man seemed to set off every video-game nerd cell in his body that Cupple was playing at something big. He remembered taking the shocks from magically generated lightning, which hurt, and remembered Cupple&#39;s statements on being able to do more than that. Only the main boss at the end of a video game seemed to have those kind of declarations and abilities. The same thing also applied in nearly every story that pitted a hero, or team of heroes, against a supervillain.<br />
<br />
Melody had shown a sort of kindness and restraint that Megan and Jenny had not shown the previous evening when they set about making sure the Chapman family would become Slug People and that further eased Jeff&#39;s concerns and worries. The only ones that really remained was the sort of sense that he seemed to be picking up from Lucy in that his twin sister seemed to be showing some interest in Melody. A part of him couldn&#39;t blame her, as Melody was attractive for a Slug Woman and had been friendly enough, and in the back of his mind, if he&#39;d met Melody under better circumstances, he might have been willing to ask for a date, but dealing with Cupple was still there and wasn&#39;t a real option. At the same time, with the sense that Lucy had some interest in Melody, Jeff really didn&#39;t want to fight his twin sister over someone she liked while also trying to figure out how to stop an evil wizard. <br />
<br />
The only thing he could try to do was make sure that nothing went bad after that, and that Melody wasn&#39;t pulling anything on Lucy. So far, though, as he and Lucy watched Melody start working on dinner, he had no reason to truly think that she was up to something. And since they really weren&#39;t at a point where they had the information to defeat Cupple right now, there wasn&#39;t much beyond having some idle chit-chat that would help them all learn a bit more about things, and for Jeff, learning about the society Slug People had been the bigger thing. Largely because it was something he didn&#39;t pay all that much attention to in high school or in college, and now he and his family would likely be experiencing many of the sorts of things that Melody and other Slug People lived through every day. Learning that Slug People, or at least Melody, had interest in human society was interesting, but Jeff wondered if there was more to it than that... or at least more to learn.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I ask a question?&quot; Jeff wondered while one eye looked at the ham that Melody was slicing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, go ahead,&quot; Melody answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You say you&#39;ve had curiosity in human society and that Jenny shared that,&quot; Jeff began, &quot;was that something you both grew up on? Did your dad support those things? Did others support you or accept that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those were three questions,&quot; Melody chuckled and then winked to Lucy, &quot;but I&#39;d be happy to answer them. For one thing... it&#39;s not something totally limited to just Jenny and me. A great many Slug People often have some measure of curiosity about human society.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was this something that relates to what your dad told us earlier... about how Slug People were created?&quot; Lucy asked, a bit curious about learning more about Melody&#39;s past and actually happy Jeff had asked the questions he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Partially, though, some of that may be more a &quot;happy accident&quot; as we weren&#39;t fully intended to be separate from the warlocks and witches we were to be partnered with,&quot; Melody answered, &quot;and more because of how human DNA or essence was likely part of the spells used in our creation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff and Lucy continued to watch as Melody continued slicing thin pieces of ham off the large piece that she had on a platter in her fridge. Part of this was amazing to Jeff, as he didn&#39;t think mundane slugs ate meat, yet Slug People seemed to be able to eat the same things humans ate. Of course, that could be another thing that Slug People picked up as part of their origins. After a few moments, Melody paused to look down at the ham she&#39;d sliced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that should be enough slices for everyone,&quot; Melody said slowly, &quot;and before I continue answer your questions... would you want it baked in the oven or on the stove?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Baked,&quot; Jeff answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fried on the stove,&quot; Lucy spoke, which got Melody to pause as Lucy turned to her brother, &quot;rock, paper, scissors?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded at one of the ways that he and Lucy had figured out ways to solve differences of opinion between them when the others weren&#39;t around to provide a majority vote. He clinched his fist and then then raised and lowered it three times before opening his fist to reveal a flat palm on the third lowering of his fist. Lucy, however, only extended two fingers and then smiled, both at winning the match and that she didn&#39;t know which of the three that Jeff would choose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scissors cuts paper,&quot; Lucy said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded and turned his full focus back to Melody, who&#39;d quietly observed the two of them, &quot;I believe Lucy&#39;s vote was for frying them on the stove...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melody nodded, &quot;you two remind me of what it was like growing up with my sisters when we hatched from the clutch of eggs our mother laid. We had lots of fun and our fair share of disagreements as well... all things that you would consider part of family life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are they now?&quot; Jeff wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just as I moved out to live my life after growing up, they did the same and live their lives,&quot; Melody answered, &quot;which is part of how all Slug People live. We are linked through our hive mind... but it&#39;s not something that makes us the same, and plenty of Slug People do enjoy the moments they can highlight their being individual members of the colony. And it&#39;s something where a fair number of the colony residents here share some curiosity about our human neighbors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But not all?&quot; Jeff asked, with one eye looking to Lucy to make sure she wasn&#39;t judging him for that question. <br />
<br />
His other eye remained focused on Melody as she collected a pan to fry the ham in and then turned the stove on. It would take a little while for pan to warm up and then to fry the ham in it. Much of the rest was something that could be warmed up in the microwave, and Melody soon set to arranging that while answering the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all... and at times my dad can be among them,&quot; Melody admitted, &quot;but most of them are also older, or have had families that remember being exploited by wizards like Cupple. It&#39;s left them more than willing to stay in the colony and not go beyond it. A live and let live situation. Humans don&#39;t come in to attack us and they won&#39;t go out to give them trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what your dad said earlier... that would be understandable,&quot; Jeff commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but they&#39;ve also understood that we can&#39;t live totally apart from humans, as we often rely on trade with them for food, supplies, help with construction of new homes for the colony, education, and all sorts of other things,&quot; Melody answered, &quot;they may not want to interact with humans all that much personally, but they&#39;re not the sort to outright forbid contact... particularly when there is no threat to the colony. It&#39;s even allowed for some of the colony to find humans they love as individuals, and they then join the colony to be with who they love...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;re welcomed in?&quot; Lucy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;With open arms,&quot; Melody nodded, &quot;it&#39;s why Cupple&#39;s arrival and activities in the area have been the problem that they are for us. He can&#39;t enslave us while we&#39;re close enough together. And we do have some friends that could try to help us if there was a way dad could convince human law enforcement that Cupple isn&#39;t quite the upstanding figure he claims to be... But so long as Cupple is in the area, he will be a threat to the colony and dad won&#39;t want us out until he&#39;s either defeated or leaves. And your report that Jenny had been caught and enslaved by him doesn&#39;t help much... growing up, much like how you likely grew up while you were human, enslaved to someone that pretty much admitted he wanted to enslave us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t there be some way to stop him?&quot; Jeff wondered...<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;d still be strong enough to kill us, and even if he wasn&#39;t, because he hasn&#39;t committed a crime that we can prove, if we were to send everyone to fight him...&quot; Melody said slowly as she put a pair of potatoes wrapped in paper towels into the microwave and pressed the buttons to start cooking them, &quot;the survivors would be arrested for committing murder, which wouldn&#39;t be good for our being trusted by humans in general.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s got to be something we can do against him,&quot; Jeff grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Life isn&#39;t like the video games you play, bro,&quot; Lucy said to him, which earned a sigh of frustration from Jeff... though he did agree with his sister on that point.</p>
