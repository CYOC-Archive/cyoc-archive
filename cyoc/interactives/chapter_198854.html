<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff woke up in the next day when he feel someone have sitting over on his wide-opened mouth. He is still in his toilet form. Jeff starting to remember what happened during yesterday, after Pedro finished using him as a toilet, Jeff passed out from the taste of Pedro&#39;s wastes, Pedro probably noticed and decided not to change Jeff to living toilet man state but rather leaving him in a normal toilet form. He can&#39;t move, talk or do anything to fight, someone now sitting over him, using him as a toilet as he is again, is it Pedro? Wait... Something not right, he can tell the one who are sitting on him right now is not a Pedro.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you Jeff&quot; Said the who one sitting on him calmly, clearly not a Pedro &quot;My name is Roy, Pedro&#39;s boyfriend, I&#39;ll be living with Pedro starting today, please be sure to get used to my wastes, I&#39;m not sure if it taste like Pedro&#39;s but oh well! Here your breakfast, it was my dinner last night, enjoy it, okay?&quot; And with that, Roy released two logs of waste, following up with pissing, breaking down his logs, by the time he done, inside the toilet bowl is filled with nothing but messy brown thick liquid, the result of melted shit logs mixed with Roy&#39;s piss.<br />
<br />
Roy got up, wiped his ass and his dick with toilet paper before dropped it into the toilet bowl, Jeff have a chance to take a good look on Roy, he seems to be around in the same age as Pedro but way more handsome than Pedro, he almost look like an actor, Jeff can&#39;t help but feel like he&#39;s blushing by his charm but this handsome man just used him as a toilet... Damn it, it taste even worse than Pedro&#39;s by the way...<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are, I see, came to introduce yourself with Jeff right?&quot; Pedro who just entered the restroom said, he walk right to Roy, then, he giving him a small kiss on the cheek &quot;Wonderful little toilet, isn&#39;t he?&quot; Pedro asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn right he is!&quot; Roy answered, chuckle before patting the top of the toilet &quot;Not to mention he&#39;s good at handle my wastes too&quot; He said as he flushing the toilet, Jeff forced to swallow everything in his bowl and soon replaced with clean water from his tank &quot;See? With all of that, it didn&#39;t clog or anything, good job Jeff!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, this is so hot, using him as our personal toilet... Just two of us, can&#39;t help myself, time to let it out a bit!&quot; Pedro who watching the whole event happening finally said, he dropped out his pants and starting to jerking off, Roy grinned as he doing the same thing, it was a quick job as soon before Jeff can prepare,Pedro and Roy both shooting a stream of cum which soon change the color of the water in Jeff&#39;s bowl into deep white, when Pedro and Roy were done, they flushed Jeff again, replaced the water inside with a clean one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that was all we can offer you for a breakfast&quot; Pedro sighed, satisfied &quot;We both have work to do, see you later Jeff, we might change you into living toilet man form again but for now, be a good toilet and stay right where you are now&quot; With that, Pedro and Roy laughed before leaving the restroom, Jeff is now alone in the restroom, as a toilet, he soon heard a car drive out, now he&#39;s alone in this house, he should use this time to come up with a plan to escape from these two mad mans or at least come up with some plan to asking for someone else help if he can&#39;t help himself but the question is how, he&#39;s just a toilet now, can&#39;t move or do anything, at least if he&#39;s in a living toilet man form, he might able to do something a bit but in this form, he&#39;s unable to do anything.<br />
<br />
Damn you that Chronivac... If only he didn&#39;t stupidly enough, thinking turning himself into a toilet would be fun... If that Pedro guy didn&#39;t notice his Chronivac program... He just showed up and took his Chronivac program for himself... Is there anything Jeff can do? If only he still able to access the Chronivac program somehow...<br />
<br />
Jeff gasped, right in front of him, a blue light appeared in the room before forming into a naked young man that look to be around his age, this young man moving around a bit like testing his own body in a very robotic way, soon, he walked to Jeff and kneeled before saying &quot;Master Jeff, I&#39;m Choron, I&#39;m your Chronivac program&#39;s support artificial intelligence, my only purpose for being exist is to support you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really!?&quot; Jeff said &quot;And you came to help me, right? Can you hear me...?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, you&#39;re still a toilet but as your support AI, I can communicate with you no matter what form you are or no matter you have ability to directly speak or not&quot; Choron gently smiles &quot;I sensed that you need a help, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here, I did checked the situation beforehand, I know you want to turn back, I&#39;ll go quick, unfortunately, I can&#39;t change you back or use any command in your Chronivac program right away, that Pedro guy is still have full control of the program, don&#39;t worry, he didn&#39;t know that I&#39;m in active state right now, back to main topic, in order to fix this problem, you have to get your control over your Chronivac program back, which is why I&#39;m here, I&#39;ll link you to your Chronivac program, once you fully linked with your program again, you can use any command by just using your thought&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! Just link me up with the program already!&quot; Jeff shouted in joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master Jeff, in order to link you with the program...&quot; Choron look uncomfortable &quot;I have to transferring a link data into you, problem is... This very data taking form that can be matching the current form of your, let&#39;s say if you&#39;re computer, this data will take a form of a USB card, simple enough... But you&#39;re a toilet... It decided to took a form of...&quot; Choron stop and rubbing his stomach &quot;You can guess it, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It taking a form as your wastes, right?&quot; Jeff asked in fear, it didn&#39;t help that Choron nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will taste very bad too, you have to focusing your mind in order to successful linking you up, it can be fail to link you in if you not forcusing enough, this is what I worried, the taste of this data might cause you to lose your forcus but this is the only way, I&#39;ll not do it right away, I&#39;ll give you a time to ready yourself, if you fail to link, Pedro will know what we&#39;re trying to do, tell me if you&#39;re ready, I&#39;ll start give you a data, you just have to forcusing your mind on the linking, forgot the taste and you should be fine, if not, it will put you in very danger because if Pedro know this, he can deactivate me, I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll go and wait outside, if you are ready, call out to me, I&#39;ll come back, it didn&#39;t have to do this day, if Pedro come back before you can decide, I&#39;ll hide myself away and we can try it another day but remember if he come back during the middle of transferring, the linking will end as a fail so careful&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that talk done, Choron left the restroom, giving Jeff a time to ready himself.<br />
<br />
What is Jeff going to do, should he do it right now? Is his mind is ready for that? Or he should wait a bit longer? But if so, Pedro and Roy will use him more and more, maybe just let Choron use him here, it will be just only one last time before he can change back to normal but what if he failed? Damn, this is too much for just one morning! It&#39;s not even 12 AM yet!!! He have to think carefully... His life depend on this!</p>
