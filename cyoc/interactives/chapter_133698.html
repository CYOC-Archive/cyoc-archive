<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*GASP*<br />
<br />
She drew in a sharp breath as soon as she awoke from a long-lasting slumber. She tried to sit up, but found herself unable to, as a large metal cuff around the middle of her torso kept her pinned onto her bed. She tried to wriggle herself out, but to no avail. Everything around her, as clean and white as it was, made her go in a frenzy. It was an unfamiliar place in a hospital-like setting. She was pinned down onto a bed, in the middle of a large, white room.<br />
<br />
Taking everything in, she found out that she wore only a hospital gown, and that breathing hurt thanks to the pressure on her torso.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Help!&quot;<br />
<br />
*aohn*<br />
<br />
*haaa*<br />
<br />
She loudly moaned after the outcry.<br />
<br />
What was going on? Why did everything feel out of place?<br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to breathe only through your nose, miss Stephens. Otherwise you can get... distracted.&quot; It was spoken through an intercom, as was noticeable thanks to a weird distortion as the voice had said it.<br />
<br />
The woman on the bed didn&#39;t really listen to the voice from the intercom, and tried tugging on the metal cuff, in hopes of getting out.<br />
<br />
It went on like this for a minute, until she heard the sound of a mechanic door opening behind her. She gritted her teeth and bent her neck to see what was going on, until she saw a tall, handsome young man with a messy haircut in a haircut quickly approach her. He represented the archetype of the handsome mad scientist, and the madness could be seen in his eyes, despite his attempt on keeping a poker face. His bright blue eyes were wide open, and they didn&#39;t match the stern expression the rest of his face showed.<br />
<br />
The woman, miss Stephens, looked at him in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;G-get me out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will. But let me explain a few things first.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man took a chair from a place that wasn&#39;t in miss Stephens&#39; line of sight, and sat down at the other end of her bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I,&quot; he began, &quot;am experimenting new technologies in the discipline of biochemistry, and you, lucky lady, were my first test subject.&quot; The scientist said the last part with a grimace on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did I get here? What did you do to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First question, you were drugged. Second question, I was getting to that right now, since I don&#39;t feel like introducing myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stood up from the chair again, and took a small wooden stick from his breast pocket. &quot;Say &#39;ahhhh&#39;.&quot; He opened his mouth wide as he said so. Miss Stephens looked at him in confusion.<br />
<br />
The professor gritted his teeth, repeating his sentence in a more compelling and forceful tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhhh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Stephens opened her mouth as wide as she could, and drool flowed down her cheeks from both sides as she did so. The longer she mimicked the sound, the more gurgled it became. A quick swallow, and she went on. The vibrations of her vocal cords caused a dull pleasure to erupt from everywhere inside her mouth and esophagus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect! Now keep your mouth wide open like that, stop with the sound.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Stephens stopped making noise as she hesitantly looked at the scientist&#39;s actions. Her hands were clutched to the side of her bed. At the beginning, all the scientist did was lay the small wooden stick on her tongue, trying to hold it in place, and pressing it to the bottom of her mouth. Next, he stuck to fingers in her mouth.<br />
<br />
Deep.<br />
<br />
Miss Stephens cried out a scream in surprise, as the pleasure caused by sticking two fingers in her mouth was not what she&#39;d expected. Instead of not being able to proceed, he stuck his fingers even further in, while the gag reflex was entirely ignored. Next thing she knew, and he was already thrusting his fingers up and down her throat. Miss Stephens had to react on her own, and with everything she got, she bit down the scientist&#39;s fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
The scientist was angry. The mad scientist was mad! If there was one thing she regretted, it was what she just did.<br />
<br />
The scientist stepped away from her, and walked out of the room, leaving miss Stephens alone again, for the moment. It gave her the time to examine her mouth.<br />
<br />
On the surface, it felt completely normal. She had her lips, upper and lower, a little bit puffed, but that was just a nice feminine trait. Licking her rows of teeth, everything seemed to be in place. But swallowing went difficult, and the walls of her mouth were softer and rougher than usual. Sticking her finger in, or using her tongue, it caused her to feel pleasure, like when having sex.<br />
<br />
The man entered the room again, and the first thing he did was hold miss Stephens by her wrists, cuffing them against the bed as well. Now she wasn&#39;t able to move her arms around anymore, however hard she tried. From his lab coat, he took a large rubber rod, and the took hold of the woman&#39;s chin, forcing her to open her mouth again. Making sure her teeth didn&#39;t get in the way, he shoved the rod inside. All the woman could do was lay still, because the rod, a large, black dildo it seemed, limited movements with her neck. She was in a panic, worried about possibly choking, but somehow, despite the length of the sex toy and the amount inside her mouth, she could still breathe through her nose.<br />
<br />
The scientist now sat right next to her, and miss Stephens could only look at him in fear through the corner of her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I will explain. And you keep your mouth shut!&quot; He said. &quot;Although that shouldn&#39;t be difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
*hmmph*<br />
<br />
&quot;I hereby present to you, the process of the operation.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a couple of papers he&#39;d been holding in his hands, and showed the woman one of her skull.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, I surgically removed everything between your jawline and underneath your nose, so that would mean your mouth and surrounding area. I made sure so get rid of all nerves trapped in between using a fancy high tech laser technique. This technique manages to make the nerve endings deteriorate and shrivel, to later be cleaned up by the white blood cells in your body and other personal bodyguards. I am proud of this work because I managed to keep the bone structure intact, you can even still use your mouth for eating solid foods, since you&#39;ve still got your teeth and jaw muscles working. From the outside, it looks like just another human face!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maniacal laughter sounded. He followed up the first picture with a picture of miss Stephens&#39; groin, and she realized what was going on. <br />
<br />
&quot;The second surgery revolved around the removal of your vagina and uterus from your lower body. As you might be able to feel,&quot; he reached underneath the hospital gown she was wearing, and patted around her crotch, &quot;they&#39;re completely gone from your grown. Down there, you only still have your anus and urethra.&quot; To make her confirm that, he slowly worked his hand up and down her crotch. She winced when the scientist used a finger to penetrate her anally.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve gotten rid of the vaginal lips, inner and outer, your clitoris has been removed, and I&#39;ve used your birth canal as replacement for the inside of your mouth, attaching it to your detached lower skull.&quot;<br />
<br />
He showed another picture, and on a tablet, a short video of her swallowing, probably while she was asleep. The video replayed automatically, and repeated the same motion over and over again in front of her eyes. She could see herself swallowing, followed by the spasm of other muscles inside her throat, and an inaudible moan escaping her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;What followed was the tiring process of attaching your vaginal muscles and nerves to your esophagus, while being careful for not taking open your entire neck. I didn&#39;t want you dead, you see? From the video you could see one of the few flaws of the whole process. Every time you swallow, the pleasure caused by it, manages to make your muscles contract. I&#39;d for some reason completely forgotten about the working of these muscles. The problem that came from it, was the risk of you choking during these contractions, especially if they were to be repeated. All we had to do for that, was detaching the breathing tube from your nose, and reattaching it elsewhere, a little further down, so you could freely breathe, even if you were assaulted by these contractions.&quot;<br />
<br />
He showed another video of her, while a nose clip held her nostrils closed up. Her entire body seemed to spasm, following the rhythm of the contractions in her neck. *An orgasm*<br />
<br />
While these contractions took place, miss Stephens could be heard breathing through her mouth, her breath stocking for a second during every spasm. A hand removed the nose clip, and while the spasms still continued, the breathing became regulated again. When she thought the video was going to end, the miss Stephens in the video went into a coughing fit, while drool ran over the corners her mouth. A subconscious swallow, and everything was gotten rid of. The girl in the video let out a moan as an end to the video.<br />
<br />
Miss Stephens still had her speech barricaded by the dildo inside her mouth, but the sex toy moved around much quicker than before the video was shown. It was as if she was sucking on it, the muscles in her neck contracted themselves right then and there! The scientist noticed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh! See? You do like the changes after all. Yes, that was you in the video, after the first ever human orgasm through the mouth. Does that get you wet? Or was it my fault, for keeping the dildo inside your mouth so long?&quot;<br />
<br />
He fell silent for a moment, before offering her something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welp, I&#39;ve explained everything you needed to know about the surgery. Oh no wait, we&#39;ve also removed your gag reflex, how could you otherwise fit that dildo inside your mouth? Do you... want me to speed up the process?&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Stephens was already too far gone, focusing more on sucking the dildo and receiving pleasure as result from it, rather than hearing out what else the mad scientist had to say. The pleasure went straight to her brain, and she couldn&#39;t think about anything else during that moment. When she felt that the scientist was moving the dildo, thrusting it inside of her, she didn&#39;t even care about anything else anymore.<br />
<br />
To her luck, she could still breathe through her nose while liquids spurted through her neck into her mouth. The contractions made them jet outwards, and the liquid spurted out of her onto her hospital gown. She found out she was no longer cuffed and held down. Sitting up, then turning around to look behind her, she saw the scientist&#39;s grimace.<br />
<br />
&quot;The world&#39;s first functioning pussy mouth. Congratulations!&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Stephens could only stare to the floor as the scientist walked from her field of vision. The realization had dawned on her.<br />
<br />
She had become a freak.</p>
