<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You bastard!&quot;, she muttered, frantically trying to decide what to say. Kyle chuckled nastily in her ear.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Too late&quot;, he snickered. &quot;Now you get both.&quot;
<br />

<br />
There was a pregnant pause, while her mind spun. This couldn't be real, could it? &quot;OK. Are you ready? I've put a lot of thought into this.&quot; He laughed rather maniacally, then continued. &quot;For the transform, you get the following. You will slowly, over the next half hour, change into the form I am currently picturing in my mind. Don't worry, you'll love it!&quot; He giggled a little, which she realised he was more than a little nuts.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Also, once you have changed, no one but myself and you will ever realise there is anything different about you. You'll live out the rest of your life as a freak, but everyone will think you've always been one and accept you, more or less. The other part is that you will seek out and seduce Rich Dalston, that good-looking bastard. When you have sex with him, he will change into an exact duplicate of you, the exception being that he will keep his face and voice to remond him of what he once was. Like you, everyone else but the three of us will believe he's always been like that. He'll realise, AFTER he changes, that you're different as well.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Kyle paused for breath, while Jennifer clutched the phone in a white-knuckled hand, scarcely breathing.
<br />

<br />
&quot;The dare part is this. I dare you to not even attempt to pass on the curse, to be unable to speak about it or communicate any information about it in any way, and to be immune to it's effects forever. You'll be stuck, for good. Have a nice life!&quot; With that he hung up.
<br />

<br />
Jennifer slowly put the phone down, her mind filled with horror. Sitting heavily on the nearby stool, she looked blankly around the room, wondering what was going to happen. For some time, nothing did. She began to think more clearly, and suddenly though, 'Hang on. This is all crap! This curse is just a story. Kyle was trying to scare me, and like an idiot I fell for it.'
<br />

<br />
Furious with herself, she got up and stomped up the stairs to her bedroom, trying to forget about the creepy phone call.
<br />

<br />
Hunting one more through her dresser for the missing sock, she chanced to look at her reflection in the mirror mounted above it a minute later, and froze. Horrified, her heart in her throat, she stared at the reflection for several long seconds, before raising a trembling hand to her ear.
<br />

<br />
It must have been her ear as it was growing out of her hear, but that was the only thing that seemed normal about it. It, and the matching one on the other side, was not a normal human ear, but instead was a large, furry, pointed ear that stuck several inches above her head. She felt it gingerly, and discovered to her terror that it was real.
<br />

<br />
The fur was the same colour as her auburn hair, short and very soft. She stroked it for a moment, in a sort of automatic motion, before she screamed at the top of her voice and fainted. Coming round a few minutes later, she was aware of an unusual feeling in her chest, and groggily sat up to investigate. As she moved her breasts bounced in her bra, much more than normal, and she looked down at herself.
<br />

<br />
Once again she was shocked. Her breasts had grown substantially, and were still expanding as she watched. Her bra was becoming very tight, and after a few more seconds she realised she had to remove it before she suffocated. This proved to be something of a challenge due to the tightness, and in the end it was the rear fastening giving way more that anything else that allowed her to remove the undergarment.
<br />

<br />
Her breasts continued to expand for the next few minutes, eventually stopping at a size that was quite extraordinary. Oddly, the breasts had grown forwards at least as much as in any other direction, ending up looking a little strange since they protruded out as somewhat elongated domes, much more than normal breasts would. When she moved, the breasts, which were amazingly elastic, bounced up and down frantically, shaking from side to side as well. Her nipples had also enlarged enormously, now being nearly two inches long and three quarters of an inch in diameter even when they weren't erect.
<br />

<br />
She stood slowly, her breasts pulling her torso forwards due to their considerable weight. There was no way her bra would even come close to fitting, but she realised she desperately needed some form of support since whenever she moved the huge mammaries flopped and bounced around almost with a life of their own. She looked in the mirror again, tears starting in her eyes, and then flopped down on her bed in despair.
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, the transformation wasn't yet done with her. Very soon she felt something odd happening around the level of her hips, and craned her neck to see past her breasts. The sight of what appeared to be small arms beginning to grow from hips that were slowly changing shape was too much, and once more she fainted.
<br />

<br />
She eventually came around some twenty minutes later, to find herself lying on her side on the bed. She felt peculiar, and tried to sit up. The motion generated a host of sensations, none of which were normal. Struggling furiously, she slid off the bed onto the floor, finally getting to her feet a few seconds later facing the mirror. She froze again, absolutely horrified at what she saw there, then looked down at herself to verify that the mirror was reflecting reality, or at least the version of it she seemed to now be inhabiting.
<br />

<br />
Appallingly, it was. The figure reflected in the mirror was easily recognisable as Jennifer, but the differences far outweighed the similarities.
<br />

<br />
She seemed to have been crossed in some warped manner with a kangaroo. Below the waist her body was that of a large kangaroo from the neck down, her waist attached where the animal's head and neck would have originally gone. This meant that she not only had the heavy tail and huge rear legs of the kangaroo, but also the shorter forelegs sprouting from somewhere in the region of where her hips had been until forty minutes ago. Her waist had narrowed noticeably to mate up with the kangaroo body, which was covered in fur the same colour as her hair. The fur stopped abruptly just below her navel, and above that she had her normal soft skin with the exception of her large ears, which she realised belonged on a kangaroo as well.
<br />

<br />
Even with the lower body transplant, though, she still only had four limbs (well, five, including the tail). Her arms had completely vanished, her shoulders rounding smoothly into her torso without a trace of any projection ever having been there. She moved one of her forelegs, discovering that it responded to the same mental commands her vanished arm would have, although it didn't have anything like the same range of motion. The paws at the ends of the forelegs lacked thumbs, as well, which made it very difficult to manipulate most objects.
<br />

<br />
She found that by bending at the waist and reaching up with a forepaw she could just touch her face, but that was about it. Her huge breasts got in the way of even this action. When she bent down like this, she could just see past her breasts that she also had a female kangaroo pouch, which her forepaws were able to pull open a little.
<br />

<br />
It took some considerable practice to work out how to move around. Jennifer found that her powerful new rear legs only seemed able to be moved simultaneously, and she was forced to hop. This of course made her huge bouncy breasts flop up and down wildly, which was not only very uncomfortable but threw her badly off balance. Eventually, she managed to work out how to move well enough to leave her room, although when she attemped to go downstairs she slid down the steps in an ungainly mass of flailing limbs and flopping mammaries.
<br />

<br />
It was nearly time for the school bus to arrive, and although she had no intention of leaving the house looking like this, she found that as the clock hands moved closer and closer to the point when the bus would turn up, she was feeling a more and more irresistable urge to go to school. After a moment she understood what the cause was, and shrieked in fury. The dare. School was where she would find Rich, and the dare was forcing her to go there to seduce him.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I'm naked, on top of everything else!&quot;, she screamed to the empty house. &quot;How can I go out looking like this? I'll be humiliated!&quot; Hopping angrily around the large kitchen, she waved her forepaws around and screamed in wordless fury.
<br />

<br />
Eventually, of course, the bus arrived, and she had no choice but to leave the house. Hopping across the lawn with her tits flapping wildly around, she watched the people already on the bus glance towards her. Amazingly, most of then only watched for a few seconds, like she was nothing unusual. She managed to jump into the bus door, then found she had to bend forwards until her forelegs were on the floor and slowly hop-walk with the aid of her tail down the aisle until she reached the back of the bus, where her friend Becky was waving to her. There was a spot where one seat had been removed, and she realised that in this new reality that was for her, since she'd never fit on a standard bus seat.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Watch the tail, Smith!&quot;, griped one boy as she went past, nearly knocking him off his seat. She stared over her shoulder at him, astounded. The curse really had made it so no-one saw anything unusual about her.
<br />

<br />
Slipping into the position arranged for her, she reared up and put her forepaws on the back of the seat in front, as the bus pulled away. Looking at Becky sitting beside her, who smiled back and began to talk about a dress she wanted to buy, she shook her head in despair. Her large ears swiveled, listening to the chatter of a couple of dozen other teenagers, and she realised she was really stuck. No one was in the least surprised to see her like this, and when she tried to raise the subject with Becky she couldn't even form the words, never mind say them. She wasn't looking forwards to school, and Rich...</p>
