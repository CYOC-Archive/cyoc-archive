<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt shuddered, involuntarily gasping out loud as the screen loaded with the confirmation alert. &quot;Are you sure you want to proceed with this transformation?&quot; It asked. A bead of sweat traced down his cheek and he swallowed hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he murmured to himself, his voice shaky, but resolute, &quot;I am. I want to do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
He clicked on &#39;Yes&#39;.<br />
<br />
The feeling was almost indescribable, like a thousand little electric pulses zipping across the surface of his skin. He reached up, touching his face as he felt his hair stiffen and recede against his scalp. He could see the reflection in the mirror on the wall in front of him, the image showing the blue helmet slowly replacing his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; He said, his eyes widening as he watched the transformation continue.<br />
<br />
The sensation spread down to his ears, transforming them into pointy antennae-like rods. He touched them cautiously, the new metallic coolness a strange counterpoint to his normally warm skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, this actually feels...” he started to say but his words suddenly cut off as his mouth sealed up, forming a mask-like grey sheet of metal over his lips.<br />
<br />
“Mmmh!” he vocalized, his hand reflexively moving to his covered mouth. A moment of fear seized him, but it was quickly replaced by excitement as he felt his breathing normal, drawing air through a new set of vents on his forehead.<br />
<br />
His heart pounded as he saw the changes in his reflection. His eyes shimmered and transformed into mechanical versions of themselves, their normally soft hazel hue replaced by a glowing, electric blue. He watched in awe as the pupils dilated mechanically, adjusting effortlessly to the lighting around.<br />
<br />
His hands trembled as they lifted to touch his new face. It was surreal. He felt inhuman, powerful, a being of metal and electricity. The stories were true, The Chronivac was real... and now, so was his transformation.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see what&#39;s next...” Matt spoke, his voice transformed into a low, almost robotic monotone, as the change began to move from his head to his neck…<br />
<br />
Another wave of transforming energy rolled down from Matt&#39;s metallic neck, causing his chest to throb and ripple. He watched, awestruck, as his chest rearranged itself into a box-like form, firm and angular. The now familiar sensation of metal replaced soft skin and his fingers traced along his new, hard form. <br />
<br />
He was not ashamed to admit to himself that this was turning him on, far more than he had even anticipated. The metallic chill was new, foreign, but in a strange way, incredibly arousing. His fingers brush against a suddenly sensitive area on his chest, causing a shiver to run up his spine. He gasped, the sound echoing strangely in the room from his mechanical voice modulator. <br />
<br />
The thrill escalated further as square windscreen windows gradually formed on his upper chest. Light refracted through the glass, a view he had only seen from inside a car and his heart thumped a strange electronic beat. Just below them, where his flat abdomen had been, was now a structure like a cooler system from a powerful diesel engine, rows of vents arranged neatly. This completed the image of his upper torso resembling something like the cab of a truck. <br />
<br />
In a breathless, robotic voice, he rasped, &quot;This...seriously, could not get any hotter...&quot;<br />
<br />
He lifted his hands to the windows, marvelling at the clear glass, the way his fingers glided over smoothly. This wasn&#39;t merely a transformation. It was a truly sensual experience. His heart pounded in rhythm with his arousal, pulsating through his mechanical body, filling every corner of his being with a lustful energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t... can&#39;t wait for the rest...&quot; he murmured, the sound reverberating like an industrial purr, buzzing through his body and making him tremble in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s arms shimmered, the skin vanishing as red, metallic arms replaced them. The transformation was intense, almost painful, yet every second of it heightened his sensation, driving him deeper into the erotic abyss. He could see the exhaust stacks forming on the sides, providing a strange symmetry to his transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;God,&quot; Matt gasped, his voice echoing out in a resonating, mechanical tone. &quot;I look...amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
His arms had morphed into something resembling the cab of a truck, complete with working pipes. The powerful joints flexed as his elbows twisted and turned. They weren&#39;t just for looks, Matt realized with a thrill as he flexed his arms, they were still functional. The sensation felt odd - almost like he was reaching out with a phantom limb - but in no way less sensual.<br />
<br />
And then his fingers, now a dark metallic blue, reached down to touch himself. His penis throbbed in response, already erect. To his delight, the cool touch of his new hands heightened the sensation, causing him to shudder in ecstasy. He rubbed himself, his excitement reaching a fever pitch, overshadowed only by the desperate need to see the transformation continue. <br />
<br />
Whimpers left Matt&#39;s sealed lips as he continued to touch himself, the pleasure heightened by his transformations. His mind reeled, imagining what would come next. His legs? His lower body? With bated breath, he watched the transformation continue to ripple downwards.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s heart pounded as he felt the transformation skip over his private area. A flush of faint disappointment washed over him, but was quickly overshadowed by a wave of sheer excitement as he felt the shift of transformation energy move down to his feet. <br />
<br />
It was a shockingly stark sensation, his feet morphing into boxy metallic structures instead of his flat appendages. He could feel the power humming beneath the surface of the metal, the silver structures protruding forward to mimic his toes arching him upwards. The stability was different, stronger. He took a step, cautious, and stumbled, the weight different from what it once was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; he murmured with an appreciative chuckle. &quot;Got to get used to walking again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly, he watched his legs morph into metal beams that reached up to his knees, connecting the solid metal of his newly transformed feet. His legs felt sturdier, more robust and exceptionally different. Matt&#39;s knees buckled slightly with a new weight, but he quickly got the hang of redistributing his leg strength.<br />
<br />
He glanced back at the mirror on the wall, his body a gleaming robotic masterpiece. He looked unlike any man he’d ever seen, a metal humanoid. The feeling sent another surge of pleasure up his spine. His penis and ass remained human, a stark contract to the rest of his metallic form. It fascinated him, how the transformation had left the most carnal parts of him untouched. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for... last part,&quot; Matt announced, anticipation heavily lacing his transformed, mechanical voice. He felt a slight thrill of fear and excitement as he prepared himself.<br />
<br />
With a sudden jolt of sensation, Matt felt the transformation energy surge back to his lower body. His ass tightened and began to change, the soft flesh quickly replaced by powerful mechanical structures. Every muscle strained against the transformation, turning into solid, metallic joints.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...oh...wow,&quot; he gasped breathlessly. <br />
<br />
His focus was diverted to his penis as he felt it suddenly retract into his body. He instinctively reached down but felt nothing. His private area began to morph, rapidly replaced by a silver plate. It glowed softly, an array of lights creating various patterns over the smooth surface.<br />
<br />
In the blink of an eye, and a rush of otherworldly sensations, the transformation was done. He took a step back, his newly formed legs adjusting easily now to the movement. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m done,&quot; he said aloud, relief and satisfaction washing over him in waves. He moved to the mirror in the corner of the room, inspecting his new form. <br />
<br />
No longer was he Matt, the slim built 23-year old gay guy. Instead, a powerful, metallic robotic being stared back at him, his once human eyes glowing with a mechanical light. A soft hum resonated around him as he moved, the new parts of his body reacting in perfect unison.<br />
<br />
And yet, he felt...whole. A new sense of pride dawned upon him. He was not the old Matt anymore, he was something new, something more...powerful. His hand moved on the cool side of his chest where a logo had eventually formed: Chronivac.<br />
<br />
&quot;It worked,&quot; He murmured. &quot;I...I really did change.”</p>
