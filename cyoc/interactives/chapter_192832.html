<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I might apply for, uhm, I was thinking maybe I could work at a local library, what do you think? After all you said I look like a librarian now, heh heh... What do you think Terry? I mean I think I&#39;d like to try and be organized and serious, and I could read all day and... and I guess I&#39;m not required to be beautiful for this job, eh? Hah hah ha -hrrk!-&quot; Eve makes an accidental pig-like sound at the end of her nervous laugh there and this causes her to be embarrassed and rub her nose again, still not used to how short and flat it was. <br />
Terry chuckles and teases her. &quot;Well I don&#39;t know about that, my dear. How about you just go back to the old strip joint where we first met, eh? Remember that at all?&quot; <br />
Eve blushes. &quot;I... I remember, yes. But Terry don&#39;t say that, don&#39;t tempt me! That was different, I was... I was Denise, I had a... I had a different face and body, I was thin and sexy... Sigh... no, no no I won&#39;t falter, I am Eve now okay? And you shouldn&#39;t confuse me like this Terry, don&#39;t make fun of me, you&#39;re making me doubt myself!&quot; <br />
&quot;Wow so you do remember, so you&#39;re not completely a different person, you just have a new personality superimposed, interesting. Well don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not trying to make fun of you, EVE, we&#39;re just having a little fun eh? Heheh&quot; <br />
&quot;Heh heh heh...&quot; Eve nervously laughs as well. <br />
&quot;So Eve, do you really think your old boss wouldn&#39;t accept you back to be a stripper? Tell me.&quot; <br />
&quot;I don&#39;t... think so.&quot; Eve felt flushed and warm now. <br />
&quot;Oh he wouldn&#39;t? And why is that?&quot; <br />
&quot;Because... because he wouldn&#39;t recognize me, come on... And, anyway, I can&#39;t be a stripper anymore Terry. I&#39;m plain, shy, I&#39;m too plump and I barely have any tit-uh, breasts! Who would want to pay to see me undress, come on be serious! And besides I don&#39;t even want to do it anymore, never!&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;d pay.&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh stop it!&quot; Eve was breathing heavy now and she was starting to break a sweat. She pulls at her shirt collar with her finger for air. <br />
&quot;I won&#39;t stop. Come on, Eve, I know you still remember how to strip dance.&quot; Terry moved in closer, grabbed her hands in his and gave her a warm kiss. &quot;Denise...&quot; He whispered to her softly and nibbled at her earlobe. She quivered at hearing him call her that. &quot;Denise, won&#39;t you dance for me again like the night we met? I know you can still do it, I want to see you rock this silly fat nerd body in the filthiest way you can...&quot; <br />
Eve suddenly slapped him hard, huffing for air and literally smoking under the collar. &quot;You sick perverted bastard!&quot; Her voice sounded more horny than angry. &quot;I&#39;ll dance for you you filthy fucker but don&#39;t you dare call me Denise again!! Do I look like Denise? NO! My name is Eve now and this is the last time I warn you to remember my fucking new name!&quot; She grabs him violently by the throat and aggressively sticks her tongue into his mouth. After a few seconds of violent smooching Eve pushes Terry away and takes a step back and starts to undulate her body to an imaginary music, hands caressing her own body lustfully. Eyes closed and lips parted, she moans softly as with one hand she massages her pussy through her thick skirt, while the other hand quickly undoes her hair bun in one swift movement. Let loose, her blonde hair spills out and falls over her shoulders in voluminous, tight curls. This surprised Terry a little, but horny as he was he still thought she looked more awkward than sexy. His arousal stemmed exactly from this contrast though, a chubby ugly girl moving like a professional stripper. Eve slowly lowers her glasses down her nose like she used to sometimes do as Denise, however she curses when she almost drops the glasses because of the awkward shape of this new nose. She just quickly tosses them on the bed and wiggles her hips as she slowly walks out of the skirt. She playfully kicks her wet panties out of the way as well and saunters back to Terry, climbing onto his lap. She expertly rides his bulge, hands behind his head as she pulls him into a welcoming kissing bout. Terry can feel her significantly heavier than she used to be, but that just made him go harder. He hungrily explored and squeezed her soft, thick body, hot and sweating in that stuffy white shirt. His fingers went to her neck and as as soon as he unfastens that stiff dorky collar he could feel her breathe in relief. Terry continues to unbutton her to unveil sweaty, soft and freckled skin. He tosses the discarded shirt and unclasps her plain white bra before proceeding to knead and massage her small flabby chest, eliciting moans from Denise who could feel the pressure transfer to her real, voluptuous boobs underneath Eve&#39;s flesh that constricted them and pressed them flat. As Terry gripped and squeezed at this chubby body for a moment she almost hoped he would rip Eve off of her and free her from this kinky bondage. &quot;Please Terry, rip her to shreds and get her off of me!...&quot; She cries out but immediately after she feels a sort of jolt going through her head, the mech-suit&#39;s control over her mind restoring itself and making her be Eve once again. She bites her lip in sudden guilt for what she just said and giggles to play it off as a silly joke. Terry doesn&#39;t seem to mind, horny as all hell he unzips his jeans and presses his cock&#39;s head against her wet entrance. Surprisingly her vagina seemed very tight and as he insists he encounters resistance. Eve screams, panicked and surprised herself but as soon as she feels his cock threaten to break her hymen, she quickly backs up off of Terry and covers her sex with her hand to protect it. The mech-suit apparently had rendered Denise newly virgin. Eve, appropriately is a virgin... <br />
Eve herself wasn&#39;t aware of this until now, but now that she knows she felt vulnerable, exposed. &quot;Don&#39;t look at me like that you pervert!&quot; She screams meekly. She runs to grab her white shirt and frantically covers herself up. She struggles a bit with the top button but once she&#39;s done she calms down a bit. She sits down at the vanity table to pull her unruly hair back into a nice, tight and neat bun wishing to make herself look chaste and composed once more. Terry gently comes from behind the chair and touches her on the shoulder. &quot;Denise...&quot; <br />
&quot;Don&#39;t touch me!!&quot; She snaps back. &quot;And for the last time I&#39;m NOT DENISE!! You felt it yourself, didn&#39;t you? My goddamn hymen! Denise was a stripper, a whore... I&#39;m Eve now, I... I&#39;m Eve the fat fucking virgin nerd, with my stupid pug face and flat fucking boyish chest, fuck me!! Augh!&quot; With another jolt, the suit&#39;s personality kicks in again. Eve starts sobbing softly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Terry, I don&#39;t want you to see me like this... I don&#39;t know why I said that... I, I&#39;m just not, you know, ready for sex, please understand.&quot; <br />
Terry hugs her gently, dries her eyes and puts her glasses back on. There was no need for words now, she understood he wasn&#39;t going to force her do anything she&#39;s not ready for. Terry learned something from this though, apparently if provoked enough, Denise would break through the suit&#39;s mind control, that was interesting. <br />
Later that evening, while Eve kept browsing through job applications, Terry read the manual for the mech-suit instead. He found out that using that control device, there was virtually no limit to how much any of these suits was customizable. He could switch facial features, hair, apparent age, body type, even her race and most surprisingly, he could change her gender as well! So it would seem that ADAM-01 model he saw at the store was nothing else than simply a male preset on display. &quot;Cool!&quot; Terry considered the options and pondered if he should make any changes to Eve.</p>
