<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The specialty stores looked nice, but really Kathryn needed normal clothes. Maybe she could try and be a punk <br />
or princess later. For now, she entered into Jenny's, the largest clothing and house hold amenities store in <br />
the mall. Racks and shelves of clothing filled a good third of the store, and the witch began to browse them. <br />
It was when she started that she noticed the other patrons also wandering around, specifically a group of <br />
three young women, about her age or younger. Judging by their chatter, there were shopping for a night out <br />
clubbing. Two were looking at some cocktail dresses, while the third was an isle over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, how does this one look?&quot; Asked a curly red head, holding a short salmon colored dress over her front. <br />
She smiled, showing off her well maintained teeth, as the blond next to her looked over the dress, her face <br />
neutral, but tone sharp. &quot;Good, if you want too look like a sore thumb,&quot; she answered, &quot;why not stick with <br />
something complimentary Lori, like green?&quot; Lori let a sneer cross her freckled face. &quot;Ugh, cliche much Anna.&quot; <br />
The blond shook her head, rolling her icy blue eyes, before turning to the other girl. &quot;What about you Alex, <br />
you find a good outfit?&quot;<br />
<br />
The brunette woman had been silent till now, in her own isle. She looked up, &quot;oh, no, I already have one. I am <br />
just looking for some underwear. They have a good sale today.&quot; She gave a cheeky smile and held up a handful <br />
of undergarments, before turning and walking away. &quot;Gonna go try some on, be back in a sec.&quot; Her heels clicked <br />
as she made her way to the changing room.<br />
<br />
Up until this point Kathryn had been listening with a slowly growing ire. The way they talked reminded her of <br />
some of her bitchier witch cousins and sisters. That was, until Alex mentioned underwear, which brought a <br />
curse to her mind and a blush on her face. She didn't even have any underwear, she never even thought about <br />
the importance of it. Clutching a pair of panties she snatched from a rack, she quickly hurried towards the <br />
changing room as well, hearing the two behind her chatter on, mentioning her even in inquisitive tones. &quot;Who's <br />
that in the rags?&quot; &quot;Oh my gawd, she isn't even wearing a bra.&quot; The two still in isle barley whispered too each <br />
other.<br />
<br />
The witch's face burned now as she stomped to the changing rooms, the world throbbing in her sight. How dare <br />
these rabble mock her. They may be pretty, but she comes from a very different world! The first door she tried <br />
was locked, and behind it came a familiar little trill. &quot;Occupied!&quot; Said the voice of Alex. Kathryn didn't <br />
seem to hear, or care, as she effortlessly pushed to door open, as if it had never been locked. She had <br />
already locked the door and was turning when Alex spoke up. &quot;Woah hold on bitch-!&quot; Was all she got out before <br />
a red faced Kathryn snapped her finger. &quot;Silence! Gah!&quot; She turned, still fuming. Alex's mouth snapped shut, <br />
lips sealed tight. Her hands flew to her face and she tried to pry her mouth open and speak. She only <br />
accomplished murmurs and moans. &quot;Those two are so insufferable! Insensitive!...&quot; Kathryn continued on, <br />
knuckles white on the panties she had taken.<br />
<br />
Alex was getting quite terrified though, and lurched towards Kathryn and she realized her silence came from <br />
her. Kathryn, momentarily off guard, tossed Alex back, the silenced brunette landing back on her rear. &quot;No, <br />
Stay!&quot; She commanded again, Alex feeling her rear seemingly glue to the ground, and her legs quiver at the <br />
thought of getting up. She looked up to the wit h, issuing a whimper. Kathryn was distracted for the moment by <br />
the underwear she had brought, finding it far too large for her (size 20!), stretching it so it blocked out <br />
vision of Alex. &quot;Oh no, this is too big...&quot; She said, a little more worry in her voice now, though still <br />
irate. She looked over to the pile Alex had brought in. They looked to small at a glance, and the tags exposed <br />
read size 4. She dropped the over sized pair with a sigh, &quot;and those are too small...&quot; Her eyes scanned and <br />
fell on Alex, who seemed to recoil at her gaze. Ire welled up in Kathryn again as she remembered Alex's<br />
friends. &quot;But, I think you will do perfectly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex's eyes grew wide and her whimpers turned into muffled squeals as Kathryn raised her arm, eyes closing and <br />
chanting all the while. A strange pinkish mist formed around her hands, then drifted down to the immobile <br />
Alex, covering her and filling her gasping nose. She sputtered as it entered her, then began to feel all warm, <br />
fuzzy, and light headed. The witch crossed her arms as Alex grew flush, her look of fear turning into shocked <br />
confusion. Kathryn clicked her tongue, smiling down, and Alex's mouth opened. She took a moment to gasp and <br />
moan, before talking. &quot;What did you do too me you... crazy bitch?!&quot; Alex's voice softened even as she spoken <br />
the red flush of her face spreading over the rest of her skin. She couldn't help but pant and moan, as Kathryn <br />
began to undress her. &quot;Your friends are the real bitches, but they did remind me I need some underwear.&quot; She <br />
tossed aside her captive's top, revealing her c cup bra. &quot;Oh, I am going to need one of those<br />
too...&quot; She said with a frown.<br />
<br />
Alex could barely muster the strength to move her arms, let alone resist this woman's assault on her. She <br />
could barely wrap her hands around her wrists to hold her away from her shorts, the witch quickly slipping <br />
them off. Alex looked down, missing her assailant slipping her own ragged jeans off, and finally saw the color <br />
oh her skin, now a warm, soft pink, and she found herself to be quite soft, her limp fingers curling back more <br />
than they should against her flesh. She gasped again as she realized her fingernails were missing, and gave a <br />
soft groan as her fingers shrank away. &quot;Oh god!...&quot; she cried out between pants, then she squirmed as she felt <br />
something tickle and crawl up her sides and under her arms. She looked down just in time to see something like <br />
a lacy ridge growing up her side before her head was.taken by the. witches's hand. &quot;Mmm, I am going to need <br />
you to look this way babe.&quot; She said pulling the changing girl's head to be facing her. Alex's eyes locked up <br />
on the looming woman's head, feeling her head held softly, <br />
<br />
&quot;What... 're you... doing t...&quot; She seemed to wind herself just talking, panting and letting her eyes wearily <br />
drop, she found herself nose straight at her captor's unclothed, roughly trimmed groin. &quot;I need underwear, and <br />
you and your friends are going to provide.&quot; She hummed and Alex felt something scrapping calmly against her <br />
forehead. She felt to spent from talking to resist it. Instead she stared forward, eyes locked on that snatch. <br />
Her flustered mind processed the words. She looked down for a moment and saw her legs straddled by the woman <br />
writing on her forehead. Down the sides of them, she could feel that tickling again, and winced as she saw <br />
lacy loops sprout from her. Her eye caught movement between her legs, but by the time she looked, there was no <br />
between. A thin webbing of what looked like pink cotton had formed, and it fattened up to the same thickness <br />
as her legs, blending with them as they lost definition. All of her skin was looking like cotton.<br />
<br />
Alex looked back up too that hairy snatch as she realized. She was turning into underwear. She was turning <br />
into pant- &quot;There, perfect!&quot; The witch said gleefully, letting Alex's head go rolling back. She weakly lolled <br />
it to one side, able to look into the mirror and see scrawled in black ink across her forehead the word <br />
'Kathryn's'. She was becoming Kathryn's panties. She moaned and her eyes looked back to that crotch, missing <br />
the sight of her black hair changing into black lace lost to her. Suddenly, Kathryn was pulling her head back <br />
in towards her, this time burying the poor pantie girl's face in her hairy groin.<br />
<br />
Kathryn smiled as Alex squirmed, giving muffled moans of resistance. &quot;Just get used to it...&quot; She cooed, <br />
looking down at the changing woman, her limbs limp, and sides covered in lace. She was flattening now, much of <br />
her already slim definition disappearing into cotton. She reached her arms up, wrapping her finger less hands <br />
around Kathryn's bare thighs, reaching up to her shapely ass as if to resist, but only seemed to blend and <br />
merge into each other. Smiling and feeling Alex squirm all the more, she cooed to her again &quot;...It's all you <br />
exist for now Alexis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexis was shocked and horrified. Not only was Kathryn smothering her with her hairy crotch, god, was it wet?, <br />
she knew her name. How could she know? She was having trouble figuring out as her nose was filling with the <br />
witch's scent. Indeed, her moist lips were soaking into Alexis's nose and lips, filling her with the scent and <br />
taste. She struggled more, trying to pull her hands away from the butt they cupped. She felt her arms <br />
tightening and shrinking, while her hands squeezed and shifted again, holding that ass even more firmly, <br />
pressing it up and out. &quot;Oh, good panties, firm my butt.&quot; She giggled down, Alexis merely moaned into the <br />
pussy before her, the intoxicating fluids of Kathryn filling her fuzzy cotton mind. She couldn't even respond <br />
to her legs lifting on their own, former feet merging with her hands. <br />
<br />
The remainder of Alexis's pink body tightened and shrunk up. Kathryn merely had to hold the black lace hem <br />
long the top with one hand and let her new panties adjust perfectly to her booty. Soon enough, there was just <br />
a pair of pink and black panties on the witch, making her ass look fantastic. &quot;Look at me! You are amazing <br />
panties!&quot; She turned, looking at herself in the mirror, admiring the panties. Holding still, she looked down, <br />
and noticed a slight, source-less tugging at the one side. With a smirk she brought her hand down to her <br />
groin, and gently rubbed her fingers along her lips, soaking the panties more. They responded, with a soft <br />
moan and a wriggling all over, giving Kathryn a slight chill of pleasure. &quot;Mmm, I don't think I even want to <br />
take you off...&quot; the witch moaned out.<br />
<br />
Alexis shuddered again, squirming around the pubis and ass that filled her. The intoxicating juices were <br />
getting into her head. It made it hard to think. A rub and a soft cotton moan, and she was having trouble <br />
remembering her name. Was it Alley... no, it was A... There was the name Kathryn written on her, but she isn't <br />
Kathryn. Kathryn is her owner, and she is panties. She makes Kathryn's ass look good.Panties thinks Kathryn <br />
tastes so nice...<br />
<br />
Kathryn smiled as her whispered words filled her new panties' soft cotton mind. She would have a most <br />
excellent pair of panties. She had finished her work on her wriggle girl panties, when she heard a clacking of <br />
heels outside, two pairs of feet. Seems some pair was coming up to the door. &quot;Hey, Alex, what is taking you so <br />
long?&quot; Asked the voice of Anna, coming close to the door. Kathryn smiled and stepped back, readying herself <br />
for the next step.</p>
