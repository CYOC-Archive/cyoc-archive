<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were the last to arrive at the dinner. There were only two spaces left. Unfortunately, they were not together. “Ricky” suggested that you take the seat between Rosemary and the director. He sat between the Andrew, the soldier and the elderly maid, down the other end of the table.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Christine was new to this theatre group and the others didn’t know much about her. You were able to answer all the questions directed at you. It was only when Rosemary asked you more about your missing boyfriend that you stumbled.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly you had to admit that ‘Matthew was short and not really terribly good looking. You did emphasise that he was smart and at 21 had completed a PhD. That didn’t impress Rosemary as much as you expected.<br />
<br />
The director was sitting between yourself and the Queen. You could tell he was enjoying sitting between the two best looking females in the room. Not that Rosemary wasn’t a hottie herself. He suggested to you ‘Perform well this weekend and we will give you a much bigger part in the next production. We need 3 female leads. Rosemary and Charlotte (the Queen) are already committed. I’ll be the lead actor in this next play myself. It’s Rudolph’s turn to direct’  You had already learnt that Rudolph (the Queen’s love interest in the current play) and the director ran the company<br />
<br />
Your immediate reaction was to say ‘That sounds great’ it was only later when his leg brushed against your own that you began to wonder if he had ulterior motives.<br />
<br />
By the time your meal was finished you were totally aware of his motives. You had to admit the director was persistent. You had taken his hand off your thigh at least three times while you were eating. You thought you had made it clear to him that you were not that type of girl. The worst problem was that you actually found your body was enjoying the attention. The massaging of your thigh through the silk dress actually felt really nice. He was quite a talker as well. You unwittingly found yourself giggling at his jokes. To make it worse he actually smelt really nice. You had to admit that Christine’s body was attracted to this man.<br />
<br />
Thank god you were driving and had not accepted the wine you had been offered, otherwise you were his.<br />
……<br />
You survived dinner but only just. Your crotch felt warm. It had been very hard not to grasp the director’s hand and replace it onto your thigh. It was only when “Ricky” approached and said ‘We should get going’ that you realised half the table had already departed. You said goodbye to the Director and Rosemary, the Director giving you a kiss and a feel up, before you reluctantly walked out with “Ricky”.<br />
<br />
On the way back to your own house “Ricky” expressed. ‘This penis is driving me crazy! It has done nothing but stand to attention all night. I feel so randy. You have to help me. I’m sure I have blue balls’<br />
<br />
You were still randy yourself thanks to dinner with the director. “Ricky” was not attractive but you were certainly curious as to what sex as a woman would feel like. You did not remove Ricky’s hand when he began to feel your thigh as you drove. You kept your eyes on the road and imagined it was the director sitting beside you.<br />
<br />
He was all over you as soon as you entered the house. You closed your eyes and pretended he was the director. He removed your panties with little resistance and you stepped out of them still in your heels. He carried you to the couch and buried his head under your dress and his tongue went to work. You liked this as it was easy to pretend it was the director. By the time he was face to face with you once more with his penis inside of you, you did not care. You were calling for him to “push harder’ and you felt him spurt into you.<br />
<br />
That was the moment a female voice said ‘Christine! What the hell!’</p>
