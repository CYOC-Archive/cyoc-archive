<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hmm, I wish Jane got bigger even faster!&quot; Alissa said, followed by loud sputters from behind. Jane instantly bloated to triple her size. Jane stumbled around but caught herself. She quickly got the size of Alissa, who was staring at her with a smug smile. &quot;You bitch!&quot; Jane yelled at Alissa. She tried to run at Alissa but fell over from the sudden weight. A loud splat followed with Jane&#39;s body jiggling immensely. Alissa merely stuffed more burritos in her mouth, waddling towards Jane leaving a large trail of crap behind her. Alissa stared at Jane who was wiggling around to attempt to give up, but stared at her with an angry/nervous face. &quot;What do you want?&quot; Jane asked angrily. Alissa swallowed a pot of beans and responded,&quot;To have revenge of course! Plus this is mighty fun! So what shall I do next?. &quot;First I want to improve myself a bit more. So I wish that I was 2, no, 3 times as big as I am right now and have a much bigger butthole! Next I want to have diarrhea, but its 1000 times worse that regular. Oh and everyone in the building except the two of us disappeared,&quot; Alissa wished. Everyone in the building suddenly disappeared. Her body expanded to her desired sized in a just a few seconds. Then her bowels started to churn and groan. Her ass blasted out a thick wave of sludge that was twice as big as herself. Alissa slowly turned her body towards Jane, who was still laying on the ground in awe of her size. &quot;No pleas- MMPH!&quot; Jane tried saying before she was smothered in a blast of poop. &quot;How does it taste? Shall I raise it up a notch?&quot; Alissa mockingly asked. All that she heard were the splashing of her own poop and Jane&#39;s muffles. &quot;I&#39;ll take that as a yes. I wish that every second my diarrhea would get 5 times as worse and that the only people in the world were Jane and I!&quot; Alissa felt her stomach groan very audibly and she could feel and see vibrations in her stomach and ass. Suddenly a blast the size of the entire room came from behind her. It was even thicker, stickier, and of course smellier than before, and Jane was in the front seat of it all. Alissa waited 2 whole minutes before saying,&quot;OK, I think that&#39;s enough for you. Plus I want you to see my creation. I wish Jane was on my stomach!&quot; Jane popped in, covered everywhere in crap. Every fold, hole, and flap was smothered in the stuff. &quot;So, how are you doing,&quot; Alissa asked, giggling. Jane, looked Alissa in rage, but looked around her surroundings. Alissa was like an island in a sea of crap. &quot;What the hell?&quot; Jane was in shock. &quot;Oh nothing much, I just wished for endless, increasing pooping capabilities. Plus it feels super nice because its really warm. I could just lay here and watch you suffer.&quot; Alissa cooly responded, wiggling herself deeper into the poop. At this point her shitting was getting as big as mountains. They managed to raise themselves out of there underground base up to 5 stories high. &quot;Suffer?! I&#39;m already obese and I had to endure your disgusting diarrhea, now you want me to suffer more?! What kind of sick person are you?&quot; Jane looked at Alissa in obvious anger and horror. Alissa looked at her in deviance and said,&quot;Well when you have the power of god at your fingertips, I see no reason not to abuse it! So I wish that you pooped from every single pore, hole, etc., from your body. Eye sockets, earholes, all that stuff! And it was amplified by 1000 times!&quot; Jane could taste shit in her mouth, her body felt stickier, the smell burned her eyes and nose. Then it all came out like a bomb. Jane&#39;s entire body oozed out diarrhea. She tried to stop it by waving her flabby arms, but it only made it worse. Jane tried to run but her body was getting consumed by all the shit. She tripped and fell into the sea of poop. She started to get indistinguishable from the other poop. The only reason Alissa could tell she was still there was because it was basically an ever growing mound of shit. Alissa decided that was enough, as it got boring saying,&quot;Alright I think that&#39;s enough. I wish Jane would stop shitting so much from everywhere, but she would still sweat diarrhea and she dug her way out.&quot; Alissa saw the mound stop growing, and saw one of its side was poking out. It took a few minutes, which at this point made Alissa&#39;s blasts bigger than the city. Finally, Jane dug out of her poop cocoon and said,&quot;You&#39;re shit you know that Alissa? You&#39;re a fucking piece of shit.&quot; What Jane said had sparked an idea in Alissa&#39;s mind. &quot;Not a bad idea Jane! I wish was filled with nothing but shit. No organs or anything, just my conscience, my ability to poop this much still, and my ability to talk. Oh and I want to piss as much as I do too, getting 5 times as worse.&quot; Jane stared at Alissa as her body darkened, turning from a tannish color to the color of the poop around her but a bit lighter. Her skin was still as smooth as before though. Her boobs lactated a brown/yellow liquid and she was starting to sweat the same liquid too. Jane waddled closer to Alissa who smelled even worse than all of the crap around her combined. She leaned onto her stomach, acting like putty. Her mouth reeked of the deadly smell, only a gelatinous slime getting produced instead of saliva.  Alissa&#39;s once blond hair turned brown and greasy. &quot;Ahh, this is great. I can call myself queen of crap! I feel so warm and soft, its so cozy. I wish I was sweating piss and poop from my entire body, release gasses from where ever, I would always be warm, and I would randomly vomit shit, piss, all of the disgusting stuff, while each time it would double in severity and frequency! Also I wish I stunk 1000 times worse.&quot; Alissa wished. Her breathing started to get heavier, heaving loads of the thick, brown gas trapped in side her. Her body started to slime up like her mouth, creating a small pool around her. But the smell was what took it. Jane couldn&#39;t even look at her as the smell destroyed her retinas. Not to mention that she was shitting out state-sized masses. &quot;I can&#39;t even look at you right now. It literally burns my eyes.&quot; Jane said trying to cover her face. &quot;I- *BLAAAAARGH*&quot; Alissa tried saying before barfing out brown, green and yellow. &quot;As I was about to say, I don&#39;t care! I love the new me! There&#39;s nothing you can do to stop my never ending power! So I wish that you build me a throne that&#39;s as big as me, making as comfy as possible.&quot; Alissa ordered. Jane tried to restrain herself, but it was no use. She was forced to get closer and closer to the monstrosity and build a throne for her &quot;ruler&quot;. It took about an hour, which Alissa used the time to blanket the entire country. &quot;  *Huff* Huff*, done Alissa...&quot; Jane grumpily said. At this point Alissa could almost never talk. Her mouth always vomited, never leaving time to say anything. Luckily, she had a solution for that. &quot;*BLAAAAARGHHH* I- wish that- *BLEEEUUUGGHH* I could- *BLAAAAAARGH* wish without- BLAARGH* talking!&quot; Alissa said, constantly barfing. A large pool started to appear in fatty dip. &quot;Ahh, that is much better! Now I wish that Jane was my slave that would do my disgusting bidding! I also wish I could control my diarrhea and vomit. My diarrhea will also be 1000 times worse every millisecond until I blanket the earth.&quot; Alissa thought. Her already colossal shits somehow got bigger, furiously shaking her ass. It took merely seconds for the earth to get blanketed in crap. The earth no longer had animals or plant life of any sort. However, there only few things that remained, like fungi, flies, worms etc.. The global temperature was constantly over 100 degrees, as Alissa wished of course. Water was either converted into more excrement or just got dirty and the air was always brown, green, yellow, or a disgusting mix. And the ruler of them all sat write on her disgusting throne. &quot;Jane! I require feeding!&quot; Alissa said, taking a pause of her vomiting. Jane, who accepted fate, slowly trudged over to her leader&#39;s body. She gripped each &quot;body part&quot; to climb up, oozing, but not separating, out of her sausage hands. It was also slick, which made it even more difficult. Finally, Jane climbed up to the surface of Alissa, who looked at her hungrily. Jane was basically Alissa, in a body that can move. Everything from the controlled waste, crap sac body, to the stench, she had, but the smell was as bad for her now which was nice. She waddled up to her mouth, each step sinking into her body. She turned around, butt towards Alissa&#39;s open-mouthed face. She laid her lardy ass right onto Alissa&#39;s face. She then let it out as much as Alissa did before, right into her mouth. Alissa graciously sucked it up, releasing her own in ecstasy. This would go on for hours at a time. When Alissa was done, she would vomit at Jane. After that, she would continue to barf and shit like she did before. &quot;Yup, this is life,&quot; Alissa thought happily.<br />
