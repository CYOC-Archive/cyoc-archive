<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Stay with me,  I&#39;m building up to something great here. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hours and days of feeling the vibrations through your clit, the soaking of your panties and the pool of juices that had formed on the blanket of the bed you finally hear your release commanded from the other room and you are all too happy to comply with her wishes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cum for me now!&quot;  You scream out into the ball gag as loud as you can.  The explosion that happens inside of you is a physical as the mental release of the orgasm.  You feel jets of cum pour out of you the same as your make ejaculation use to, but with an even larger and longer jet.  Stream after stream of your cum shoots out.  With each jet you can feel it push from your car inside a it constricts. The force of each jet of your cum is strong enough that you feel it dislodge the vibrator away from your pussy. <br />
<br />
It continues going.  The orgasm will not relent.  You&#39;re already soaked,  every muscle is hurting from the constrictions. Then it goes away.  All of it fades quickly and goes to black. <br />
<br />
You awake to Wendy&#39;s worried words.  You can&#39;t focus on them yet,  but you can tell that she&#39;s terrified from the look in her eyes that are just now coming into focus. &quot;Oh shit,  are you ok?  Baby,  say something.   Say anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
You try to talk,  but your jaw is very sore from the ball gag.  You start to stretch it out. &quot;Oh fuck.   What was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God,  I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re alright. I just wanted to occupy you while I had fun sorting through everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
With everything coming back into focus and your words returning to you,  you are able to catch on.  &quot;What did you do Wendy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you were annoying me and I could tell that you were anxious. So I turned submission up to 80% and brought you in here.   Right before I let you cum I turned your orgasms up to 95%.  They aren&#39;t lethal until 110%.  But apparently blackout is before that.  God, are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
You move your body and feel exactly how much cum is all over you.  The bed is soaked and you can feel the blanket sticking to you all of the way to your feet and up to mid back. Your arms and legs are still bound and Wendy realizes it right then.   She releases you. <br />
<br />
You sit up,  but are still light headed.   You had no idea that an orgasm could do that to you. &quot;That was too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,  when I came in and saw you squirting half way across the room I kinda got excited,  but it wouldn&#39;t stop.  I watched you in full orgasm for 3 minutes.  I thought you were going to stroke out. I went in and turned it back down, and when I came back in you&#39;d pass out from it all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the submission?&quot; You had to ask,  but could yell it was back where it had been. You didn&#39;t have the urge anymore to call her master or seek out her approval even to your own potential detriment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Back where it was before. I only did it so I could search through every bit of the contract.  I won&#39;t do that again. I love you,  not a mindless slave.&quot;  That made you feel a bit better. &quot;Come on,  let&#39;s get you a bath.&quot;<br />
<br />
She brought you into the bathroom and started the water in the enormous jacuzzi tub. She took care to strip you and place your soaked under garments in the basket. Then she stripped and got into the tub with you. <br />
<br />
The warm water was refreshing on all of your parts.  Your body is still sore and worn out from that mind blowing (almost literally) orgasm.  You make a note to ensure that you try out at least one 85% orgasm before finalizing your contract and being locked into it forever.  You can just imagine what it&#39;d be like to pass out each time you got off. <br />
<br />
Wendy starts playing footsie with you in the huge tub.  You are each at opposite ends and her feet each up to your knees. &quot;You doing alright?&quot; You can still tell that she feels guilty and concerned for you. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m alright. Just wondering what all of this means for us. And honestly a bit worried about your additions after that experience,&quot; you admit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything that will compromise you.   I promise.  I believe in freedom,  and especially free will.  I&#39;ll not force you into anything. And any other changes should just heighten out time together.  Oh,  and none of the changes carry over to your original body,  so you&#39;ll know if any of my charges effect you on a mental level.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I honestly haven&#39;t even really thought about changing back since this crazy ride all started.  I honestly feel way happier like this.   I feel more comfortable, relaxed,  sexier, and I don&#39;t know better, more myself as Julia.  Does that make any sense at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly,  yes and no.  You&#39;ve always been the man&#39;s man.  Your built,  confident,  a bit serious sometimes,  but you&#39;ve always known who you are.  It&#39;s a surprise,  but when you think about it it also makes sense.  As Julia you can let your hair down and enjoy. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a bit of a break. You have a fresh start and aren&#39;t carrying any learned behaviors are preconceived notions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I just get a minute long therapy session?&quot; you say giggling. <br />
<br />
&quot;You knew what you were getting yourself into.&quot; She giggles back at you. &quot;I&#39;m really glad that you&#39;re enjoying yourself and able to enjoy yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m ready to finalize my contract. I&#39;m very happy with where I&#39;m at.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,  there are a few things that we need to look at again on your end. I found them on the spouse&#39;s side and we need to correct them on yours. When you were going through i think we were looking at the novelty of it all and only looked at the fun stuff.   There is some serious stuff in there.   I&#39;m in love with you and this fabulous body,  but I looked under age.   You can be any age you want. And more so,  you can have it progress age or stay the same. Imagine being 90 and stepping into your 35 year old body.   Or set it back to even younger. I really think that if we do this right you could actually live a life span longer than our natural life would be.  And there is health.  No STDs, no natural illnesses.  To me both of those are no brainers. You already don&#39;t have to worry about getting pregnant,  but there is a lot that can be used to protect you. I know when we come back and I do mine in choosing the longest life and the most use out of that body as possible. I&#39;d really like for you to do the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
You&#39;re see struck.  A body that doesn&#39;t age or get sick.  Holy crap. &quot;Yeah,  I think we definitely need that.   What else did I miss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,  there is also a clause,  I don&#39;t know how else to phrase the different changes and the rest is in legal speak so I&#39;m going with it,  clause that states the spouse amendment will reciprocate with any and all forms currently or in the future be provided to the spouse.  Basically right now my spouse amendments only work on this body.  If I get another,  then they won&#39;t work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, we can change that.&quot;  Whatever fun she came up with you know that you&#39;ll want it regardless of what body she is in. &quot;Should we go do it now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s actually bath first.   Your orgasm was intense.  And honestly,  your cum was just as thick as when you&#39;d shot it from your cock.   And there was a ton more this time,&quot; she giggles out. &quot;Come here and let me wash you.&quot;<br />
<br />
After about an hour of waking each other,  both of you step off the bathroom dried and naked once again.  You put on your last new thong and bra. &quot;We&#39;re going to have to go shopping soon.  I&#39;m out of undergarments and don&#39;t have any actual clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re already wanting to go shopping.  Damn,  your such a chick,&quot; she says jokingly. You both quickly work through the last minute changes for health and age and save all of the changes.  You decided to go ahead and change your current she to 21 and stop the aging process. You don&#39;t have to finalize it now and honestly until you figure out how your 85% orgasm is going to work out you&#39;re not willing to risk it. <br />
<br />
Your putting away the papers when you knock the folder over. You notice an extra piece of paper with another link printed on it.   It must have been in the right side under the extra copy of the terms. You and Wendy look at each other and you pull it open.   It&#39;s a link to the spouse amendment for &quot;Wendy&quot;.  <br />
<br />
She checks her folder and finds another link.   Is for her contract. &quot;What the hell? Jack and Jen said only one modification per trip.&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when it dawns on you.  &quot;Did they say only one person can modify or one modification per person?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her face lights up. &quot;Holy shit.   They didn&#39;t say. I just assumed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clause 1A and 1B are the same as yours. Then it&#39;s different.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look over and read<br />
<br />
&quot;<br />
2 Means means and methods of transformation:<br />
2A Provided and accepted by primary contract recipient&#39;s spouse.<br />
2B Form of initiating clothing: swimsuit<br />
2C Initial Transformation made. NA<br />
2D Initial Transformation Details: NA<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we supposed to share the swimsuit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No my contract says it&#39;s non- transferable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it also says the my spouse has it.  Unless I have another spouse, then it must be the swim suit from yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit.  It&#39;s a swimsuit from yesterday,  but not mine.&quot;  You&#39;re sprinting to the bedroom. Grab the bag from the pool and pull out the black thong swimsuit. &quot;I forgot that I&#39;d out it in here.&quot; Wendy looks puzzled and confused. &quot;When I put mine on and it made me this sexy hot chick I thought maybe I&#39;d try this one later and see if I became a different sexy hot chick.&quot;<br />
<br />
She is dying laughing now. &quot;How did it work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, crap I don&#39;t remember. Uhhh, right! So I picked mine up and saw the same sexy chick from my dreams.   Julia,  I know now.  When I put it on bam I am Julia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re my sexy hot chick.   I don&#39;t want us to be twins. That&#39;s too many problems when we go out.   Everyone thinks we&#39;re twins and then we&#39;re making out.   That&#39;s how we end up in jail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,  that could be an issue.   Plus I love your natural body.   What if you just imagined yourself at 21 with the no aging,  health, and whatever sexy makeup?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooo. I like it.  Just a few small tweaks and I&#39;ll be in love with my new body. I need a few minutes to think to perfect my new body.   Do you want to go order food and more wine while I think on it?&quot;<br />
<br />
You pull her into a tight embrace and kiss her deep,  then you&#39;re off. &quot;Oh,  pick out carefully what cloths you&#39;ll wear right before you change.   Your bra and panties aren&#39;t very durable and won&#39;t last long and you&#39;ll want the option of always being able to change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yes.   I love you.   I wouldn&#39;t have thought of that,&quot; she tells back. You go ahead and order food and some nice wine and start day dreaming of what he new form will look like. Soon you hear her yell again.  &quot;Go get on the bed, I&#39;m gonna want to try this body out as soon as I can.&quot;</p>
