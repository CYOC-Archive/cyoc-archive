<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aidan bit his lip. He was into all kinds of things, sure, but one thing that always got him going was a solid age regression fantasy. He&#39;d read all kinds of fiction. Accidental regression. Intentional. Guys growing younger against their wills. Regressed into adolescents, children... babies. Each of them still managed to do it for him. So that seemed like a good place to start. Aidan Sterns would be a child again.<br />
<br />
He clicked the Age option, and saw his current age of 22.  He wanted to be younger, but not so young that he would be rendered helpless.  He also didn&#39;t want this change to be permanent in case something bad happened.  At the same time, he wanted to notice a difference when the transformation stops.  When prompted to enter his new age, his fingers hit the keys.  15.  He backspaced.  13.  Backspaced.  He wanted to be even younger, young enough so that people would start asking him where his parents are, at least for tonight.  With a wry smile he typed in 10. Stared at it... then backspaced once more, changing the number to 9. He wasn&#39;t sure why, but that extra year off made him think of himself becoming so much younger, as if 10 was too old in comparison. <br />
<br />
When he clicked off the box, a warning popped up. &quot;Attention: You have opted to regress to an earlier stage in life. We suggest new users alter reality when trying a change like this for the first time. Would you like Chronivac to automatically change reality to fit your new age?&quot; He stared at it a moment. His wry smile opening into a full on grin. No, he didn&#39;t want that. He wanted to not be at the mercy of adults, nor did he want to lose his current life. He scanned for more options. He once again clicked permanent until changed, others should be unaware, but he should be fully aware... and a new option. &quot;Change wardrobe to match&quot; Apparently it could make his clothing smaller and more age appropriate too... but for now, he clicked no.  One final suggestion Aidan saw was the regression increments.  His regression could be immediate, slow and continuous, or in chunks.  He picked the option for chunks of regression, and set it to 10 minute gaps between his changes. He&#39;d be able to explore his body as he gets younger that way.  The program suggesting he regresses over 3 chunks, which he agreed to.<br />
<br />
It was ready.  He could barely contain his giddiness; he was nearly vibrating as his finger clicked &#39;Begin&#39;.  There was a brief 3 second countdown as if it were taking a photo, where the word &quot;processing&quot; flashed on screen, and then it started.  A strange tingling sensation flowed through his body.  While it wasn&#39;t noticeable right away, Aidan was beginning to lose some muscle definition as his body was descending through his college years, particularly his torso and chest.  His 4-pack started to fade away, and his pecs were flattening, soon to be replaced with a smooth chest that Aidan had throughout his adolescence.  By the time he noticed his pants had just started to get loose on him, the process stopped.  Aidan looked down over himself, adjusting to the view of his slightly smaller body.  His clothes were starting to get big on him since Aidan didn&#39;t start working out until college.  Looking at his stats, the number flashed right at him.  17 years old.  5 years younger.<br />

<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; Aidan blurted out, hand going to his smooth torso.  Though Aidan looked more like a smaller version of his older self, he was in disbelief that he was a teenager again, and he was going to get even younger.  He smiled wide and darted for the bathroom to see himself in the mirror.  When he saw himself, he stopped dead in his tracks, marveling at his teenage body.  He looked exactly as he did when he started his senior year of high school.  He didn&#39;t notice that he was a couple of inches shorter, which only meant that puberty wasn&#39;t exactly finished with him at the time.  He stood dumbly checking himself out, unable to believe that he actually got younger, losing track of time.  He found himself trying to flex in front of the mirror, only to not see much come from his average-looking body.<br />
<br />
Before he knew it, the tingling feeling came back, which meant Aidan would go through puberty in reverse.  What remained of his body hair began to recede, starting with what was left on his torso and chest.  Aidan then noticed an oddly pleasant tingle on his crotch.  He looked down, only to see that his genitals were shrinking!  The sight of seeing it shrink was making him hard, but it was getting more difficult to tell with his shrinking boner.  By the time Aidan looked up again, the stubble that was on his face had completely vanished, and his arms and legs had also smoothed out.  Aidan also noticed that his hair was starting to grow, reverting back to the helmet hair he had as a young teen.  He touched the hair out of shock about his hairstyle reverting, but that also made him hard again.  Looking back down, Aidan had noticed that his pubic hair was also starting to recede.  Aidan laughed at that sight, only for him to gasp as he heard the voice that came out of his mouth.  &quot;Holy crap, I&#39;m starting to sound like a kid!&quot; Aidan shouted with a wide grin as he even started to sound younger.  <br />
<br />
Aidan quickly ran to the Chronivac, ditching his much too large pants at this point, and was surprised to find that the room was looking larger than before, which meant that Aidan was starting his shrink spurt.  But just as it was about to start, the second chunk stopped.  Aidan looked down at his even younger body, which looked as if he was just starting puberty, with the only remaining body hair being the few strands on his armpits and a small patch around his ankles.  While looking at his ankles, he noticed that even his feet were smaller as his socks were starting to flop around.  He took them off to reveal that small patch of hair on top of the smooth feet that he had before puberty.  His shirt, once slightly bulging with his muscular body, was now barely past his genitals.  The sleeves on his shirt went up to his elbows, with his shoulders barely able to hold up the shirt.<br />

<br />
The number representing Aidan&#39;s age stared right back at him.  He was 13 years old again, and it looked like he had just started puberty at that age.  With only an oversized t-shirt on him, Aidan ran back to the mirror.  &quot;God, I&#39;m... no way...&quot; he muttered to himself, hand gripping his throat only to notice the lack of an Adam&#39;s apple on his neck.  A huge grin appeared on his face, the smile populated by the crooked teeth that he had until he got braces at age 15.  Not wanting to miss out on his young teen body, Aidan took his shirt off, and every part of his younger body was seen.  A pathetic-looking erection appeared almost instantaneously, paired with his much smaller testicles.  What was once an athletic-looking college male less than 30 minutes ago now stood a boy that had just finished the 7th grade and had just started puberty.<br />
<br />
Aidan headed for the kitchen with his hands covering his genitals, while blushing at the realization that his hands were now small enough to cover them without hassle.  Despite the regression, Aidan&#39;s modesty remained as he didn&#39;t want anyone to look into the window and see himself naked, especially while he&#39;s making himself younger.  He looked into the fridge for a brief moment, only to remind himself that he can&#39;t have any of the beers in there now that he&#39;s 13.  He checked inside to see what else he could take, only to feel the cold air touching his smooth skin, and for Aidan to speculate whether he could be small enough to fit inside the fridge.  After coming out empty-handed, he decided to sit on the couch to see what was on while waiting for the last chunk to come through.<br />
<br />
The 10 minutes felt like ages as the young teen sat nude on the couch.  He nearly let out a high-pitched yelp as the tingle returned.  He instinctively checked on his armpit hair, which receded right before his eyes.  He then glanced at his feet, witnessing the last of his ankle hair, and body hair as a whole, disappear right before him.  As he watched his puberty finish in reverse, Aidan started seeing his feet coming closer to him.  He could barely contain his excitement as he continued with his shrink spurt as he reverted to his elementary school days.  His tongue felt around his jaw, only to catch that some of his teeth had started to recede and be replaced with baby teeth that hadn&#39;t quite come out yet.  As the boy ran from the couch to the Chronivac, he continued to get smaller and the Chronivac continued to look further away.  Aidan attempted to put his shirt back on, only to continue shrinking into the shirt.  As the changes finalized, Aidan started to find it difficult to get hard; no matter how much he thought about this being unbelievably real, he was unable to get erect at all.  The giddiness remained throughout the shrink spurt and before Aidan knew it, the changes were finished.  This reminded him to get the rest of his clothes that he left in the bathroom.  Aidan knew that he had to hold up his jeans the second he stepped into them.  He didn&#39;t want to look in the mirror yet; he had to find out just how much the changes affected him.  Staring blankly at the computer in his baggy clothes, Aidan saw the final results for his changes.<br />

<br />
Aidan stared in disbelief, standing in his overgrown clothes, no longer a strapping homosexual male, but instead a boy that didn&#39;t even start 4th grade.  &quot;Holy shit,&quot; Aidan murmured, giggling at the sound of the curse in his high-pitched voice, &quot;I&#39;m nine years old.&quot;  He ran into the bathroom to check out his much younger body, nearly tripping on his jeans.  Not wanting to hesitate any longer, Aidan once again took off his clothes to look at his childish body nude.  When he was older, the sink couldn&#39;t go past his waist, but now it was a little over halfway between his belly button and his nipples.  He found himself having to stand on his tiptoes to get a closer look of his face.  With the exception of his blue eyes, the face he was staring at was exactly as he remembered from his 4th grade school photo.  He touched his genitals, not expecting any feeling from it at all, and he couldn&#39;t get hard.  Aidan didn&#39;t care; his fantasy came true.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;M NINE YEARS OLLLLLLLLLD!&quot; He bellowed, joyously, laughing aloud as he jumped on his much larger clothes. The pure happiness that coursed through him was even more intense than he had anticipated - a little voice in the back of his mind suggested that it might be because nine-year-olds don&#39;t have the greatest control over their emotions, but he dismissed it as quickly as it arose. He was a boy again and had the power to do just about anything he wanted.<br />
<br />
Aidan ran over to the Chronivac in case there was another fantasy he wanted to satisfy.  He was planning on staying like this throughout the night, but he can change something else about his body.  The young boy licked his lips as he looked through more options.</p>
