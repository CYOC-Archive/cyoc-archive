<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon thought for a few minutes. He went back and picked up his original wish, reviewing what he had written.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you turn me into Danielle, with the details I specified?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To an extent.&quot; The genie explained a few more problems with Damon&#39;s lack of clarity -- she had no control over him &quot;regretting&quot; his cup size, and implied she&#39;d rather make him happy than not. Regardless, she couldn&#39;t use that as a measurement. Also, &quot;hip size has nothing to do with running capability, so that part is meaningless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhm.&quot;<br />
<br />
The genie also suggested a body with a bit broader appeal (to make matchmaking easier for her), but Damon decided he wanted to stick with a shortstack.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then -- wishing for perpetual good health is a separate thing, you know? Sagging I can prevent, but that will make some people curious. Want samples of your breast tissue to reverse engineer the secret to your success, and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon blushed, and felt himself getting hard again at the thought of being treated like a medical anomaly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it... may not be necessary anyway. What with... advances in medicine. But I do want you to insure perky breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the genie nodded, Damon thought ahead to his second wish. He had long fantasised about <i>growing up</i> as a woman struggling to cope with her &quot;objectification,&quot; and had drafted his initial wish as a kind of compromise between that and not wanting to actually relive his teens. However, now he wasn&#39;t sure he wanted to put off the sex. He was already getting hard again at the thought, and being sixteen... that would really limit his options.<br />
<br />
And if he were to go to a new world, what difference would it make? He&#39;d have a whole new culture to adapt to, his apparent age wouldn&#39;t matter. Better to be more mature for that. For any... kinky sex... he might get as a man&#39;s plaything...<br />
<br />
And the idea of a new world was growing on him. A new world! So much might be different, so many other possibilities besides a more accepting culture. But he wasn&#39;t sure. It would be a huge change... and he actually wasn&#39;t sure he wanted to be part of a culture where his kinks were seen as normal. It was weird, but he realised now that the &quot;extremeness&quot; of his fetish was part of its appeal. He did still kind of want to wrestle with society&#39;s expectations of women, as well as his own.<br />
<br />
Either way, that was a decision for future Damon. <i>One wish at a time.</i> He took a deep breath to steady himself. Meanwhile, the genie seemed to have been thinking along similar lines, for she said,<br />
<br />
&quot;One last thing about your transsexual wish -- are you sure you&#39;re okay with older guys sexing you at sixteen? If I know American culture you might feel... uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Make me eighteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right!&quot; Silence for a few moments. The genie&#39;s mouth quirked. &quot;You have to &#39;say the magic words,&#39; master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right. I wish for you to turn me into Danielle, an 18-year-old girl, with the measurements we discussed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Done.&quot; The genie snapped her fingers, and Damon collapsed on the couch as a giddy euphoria overtook him. Even as he fell, the room darkened in his eyes, and he felt himself changing. His body shrank down on itself, losing nearly a foot of height: hips pushing out, spine curving, waist tightening, shoulders caving in. Mass transferred into feminine fat, rounding out his hips, butt, thighs -- and breasts, nipples growing sensitive as they pressed against his shirt.<br />
<br />
Then that shirt was a sexy, low-cut blouse, and Damon felt the soft, tight embrace of a bra around his new bust. His pants became a mini-skirt; his boxers, panties to match his bra. <br />
<br />
His dirty blond hair grew out to shoulder-length. His face turned cute and feminine, with a small nose, pouting lips and large, long-lashed blue eyes; a little more youthful too as he lost several years. Within his skull, his brain filled with new information on women&#39;s self-care while his sexuality and identity were adjusted to <i>her</i> specifications. And likewise, her biology: cock and balls sucking into her body to become part of her female reproductive system.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooohh!&quot; Danielle cried in a girlish mixture of pleasured moan and surprised squeak as her amply padded rump connected with the couch cushion. She held a petite, well-manicured hand to her forehead. &quot;What a rush...&quot; Her eyes widened as she registered her breathy tone. &quot;Oh my gosh!&quot; Even though she had felt every change in intoxicating detail, it had all been accomplished in the second it took for her to fall.<br />
<br />
Her nethers were already leaking hot fluid at the excitement of the change, her belly empty and aching to be filled, but the wonderful sensations of female arousal only peaked as she looked at her polished nails and felt her massive breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... ohhhh wooow... this feels... mmmph... so much better than I thought it would...&quot; Danielle rubbed her thighs together, and started to slip a hand under her waistband when she remembered she had an audience, and blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on,&quot; said the genie. She was smiling with satisfaction. &quot;I don&#39;t mind. Seeing people made happy by an innocent wish is one of the few perks of this curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm...&quot; Exploring herself was tempting, but so was making another wish. She... she really wanted to have sex right away. Maybe she could wish the genie to be her big strong boyfriend, as she had suggested. Or maybe she could wish for the genie to be her best friend and chaperone and scout out guys for her. Or maybe she could even explore the genie&#39;s sexy body as-is! She was still attracted to girls, after all, and somehow being a girl herself made the prospect feel slightly taboo and exciting.<br />
<br />
She giggled, and absent-mindedly slid her fingers into her panties. Her eyes closed as she contemplated the prospect of a new world... To be part of a harem with other sluts under the protection of a pair of strong, handsome men... Or even to be an outright, literal <i>slave</i> to some powerful master... Yet another idea was to be a prostitute, in this world or another, pimped out by the genie for others&#39; pleasure...<br />
<br />
She began to breathe harder as she worked her fingers into her virgin snatch, imagining a thick cock dominating her. Various archetypes of masculinity flashed through her mind -- she was trapped, helpless and pleading, beneath everything from beach hunks to barbarian overlords. &quot;Ahhhhh!&quot; She felt a spasm run through her as her fantasies ignited her lust. Writhing on the couch, she soaked her panties with her first female orgasm. <i>Oh my God it feels so gooood...</i> <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... ah...&quot; She opened her eyes, her cheeks staining again with cute red as she saw the genie watching her affectionately.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? Women <i>do</i> appreciate their bodies. And now what, mistress?&quot; Danielle felt a little thrill at being referred with the feminine term, as the genie continued. &quot;The magic of your change will spread to your belongings as you touch them, and I can tamper with people&#39;s memories of you so it won&#39;t be too awkward to carry on with your life. Or maybe you&#39;ve thought about a truly new life in another world?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have.&quot; Danielle swallowed and pulled her hands away from her body. Composing herself wasn&#39;t easy -- she was still so horny, her fantasies still buzzing unrequited in her head. But she needed to focus to make this wish. &quot;And I&#39;ve decided...&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
What is Danielle&#39;s second wish?</h3>
