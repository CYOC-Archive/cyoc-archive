<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Francis was so excited about changing people age that he was looking for another person to change. He left me alone for a while, which made me happy because Francis&#39; anxiety was making me tired. I saw how much people were here. Young couples, elders, even some teens around our age. I wonder who Francis will told me to change.<br />
<br />
I looked the remote for a second. Does this thing need batteries? How long it will works? I think it&#39;s better to arrive at the shop to buy another one in case this one stops work.<br />
<br />
I played with the remote a few making a tree next to me growing a little. I&#39;m surprised it works on everything. Then, I saw Francis coming back. He had a mischievous smile on his face barely appreciable due to his thick beard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found one!&quot; He says. &quot;He is over there!&quot; He pointed out some bushes behind us.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is there?&quot; I asked but he holded my left arm and pull me to there instead. When we arrived, I was scared of what I saw. A baby, maybe 1 year old, was sleeping in the grass.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done?!&quot; I muttered to Francis trying to sound intimidating but without awaking the baby.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found him sleeping on a stroller.&quot; Francis said smiling. &quot;His mother was completely distracted with his Tablet that she didn&#39;t see me taking him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you crazy?!&quot; I muttered again. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be blamed of kidnapping!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid.&quot; Francis said. &quot;We just will change him quickly and I&#39;ll return him after that.&quot; I was still doubting when Francis kept talking. &quot;If you&#39;re not sure, I can make it. Give me the remote!&quot;<br />
<br />
Francis used his new strength to take me off the remote. I tried to take it back but he was considerable bigger than me, it was useless to fight against a grown man like him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok. I&#39;m with you.&quot; I said resigned. &quot;So, give me the remote.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled satisfied and he threw the remote a few feet away from me. I quickly recovered it and returned to my position. Then I saw that Francis was undressing the baby.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing now?&quot; I muttered him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see&quot; He said to me. &quot;What&#39;s the point if we don&#39;t see?&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and nodded. &quot;How old do you want to turn him?&quot; I said while I was calibrating the remote.<br />
<br />
&quot;My age!&quot; He said excited. &quot;I didn&#39;t see me grow, so I can see him now&quot;<br />
<br />
I set the parameters and pointed to the baby, a little light beam hit him and the process started. As a baby he quickly was growing to a toddler, his small feet grew a little bit and some hair appeared over his head. As he grew to toddler he moved to an extended position which displayed all his body like Da Vinci&#39;s vitruvian man. On this age, his arms, legs and torso grew more until he was almost my height. I must say that I&#39;m not a tall guy at all, by the way. Somehow, I wasn&#39;t too excited about this transformation. What&#39;s the point of this, I have seen this on me before, it&#39;s called life. Also, I was too worry about being discovered by someone and ending on prison or something like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here comes the best part!&quot; Francis said, I saw his face for a second, he was too excited. Maybe these ageing things turn him on. &quot;Puberty fairy, I count on you!&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
I saw how the former baby was arriving to his teenage years. A few more inches grew on his arms and legs, until he looked like a boy on my age. Then, he went to a growth spurt. His arms and legs doubles their sizes in matter of seconds. His hands and feet did the same until he looked a little disproportianate. His baby fat melted turning him way more slim. To my surprise, a little bit of hair had begun to appear on his body. Subtle, on his legs and on his crotch. His penis, which was unimpressed all the past time, were shacking as it started to grow, as well as his small testicles.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a dissapointment!&quot; Francis said. I thought he was expecting a more exciting transformation. I tried to say him that&#39;s how life works but a second growing invaded our sleeping friend.<br />
<br />
His body hair started to grow thicker on his legs and arms. The one on his crotch turned into a wild black forest. Muscles started to grow all over his body, giving him some biceps, quadriceps and wider shoulders. His feet grew to a impressing size almost as big as Francis&#39; feet. His face lost all his childish looking and it became manlier with a beard starting to grow on his squarer jaw. Finally, his penis reached huge lenght and thickness. I was like a sausage whose mushroomy head had ended touching the grass around him. His balls grew hair on them and pumped until they were like chicken eggs. Maybe he was around his twenties right now.<br />
<br />
But, he didn&#39;t stop there. Francis told me that he wanted to turn the boy into a 35 years old, just like him. So, the guy kept growing, it wasn&#39;t too impressing like before but we saw how his muscles grew more until he looked like a hunk. Hair thicked all over him, specially on his chest where it had started growing a few seconds before but know it looked like a black coat over him that hides his pecs and abs. His messy pubic hair was growing wildier than before, as well as his armpits, His beard grew thicker and longer until it connected to his chest hair.<br />
<br />
Finally, the remote buzzed indicating that the transformation had finished. Me and Francis saw amazed at the naked sleeping man in front of us. It was incredible to think that he was just a few feet tall and now he is way taller than me. Despite of all his body hair, he looked very young, in contrast with Francis who looked like his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing!&quot; Francis said excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I will change him back.&quot; I said and started to set the configuration on the remote.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on!&quot; Francis said. &quot;I have another idea!&quot; Then, he grinned at me.</p>
