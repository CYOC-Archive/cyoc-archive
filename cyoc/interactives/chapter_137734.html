<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">THEN-You stand looking into the park, it is full of males enjoying themselves as the Carnival music plays that the scene before you is one of vibrancy and color. Straight ahead of you there are three main buildings as A queue of boys and young men wait to ride the roller coaster that There is a fun house slightly back and looks a little disheveled. No one is around it that Red neon flashes to your right from a strip joint called &#39;Pleasure&#39;. This is gonna be fun that Seeing the door, you of course just have to enter it.<br />
<br />
 Inside you see a long dark tunnel that Looking around to see if anyone can see you, you enter the tunnel and close the door behind you as you Creep down the tunnel and pass several wide doorways on both sides, but the growling noises warn you not to enter. You shouldn&#39;t be down here as it is that You hear the sound of dripping water from an open doorway and peer in to see a large, mirky pool. further along, you see what looks like heavy mechanical devices, including some sort of lifting gear as you Then you see light from around the corner that Peering round it, you find a large curtained doorway which leads outside to who knows where.<br />
<br />
you soon see a crowded arena that In the middle of the ring is a man wrestling with a 7 foot tall, and very muscular anthromorthic alligator. it looked like he was losing, but the gator soon has the guy pinned down in such a bodylock. Sure enough, he can&#39;t even move a finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, too bad You&#39;ve lost. we all know what that means, right?!&quot; says a pretty girl that enters the ring who is clearly the master of ceremonies as the crowd soon was crying out a &#39;HEE-HAW!!&#39; sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!!&quot; cries the man as he was still pinned under the gator when Suddenly his ears grow into donkey&#39;s ears that The gator gets off him while he continues to change. dropping down to all fours that The crowd laugh as he quickly becomes a real donkey and gallops out of the arena towards the curtain where you are hiding.<br />
<br />
the donkey gallops past while braying, not noticing you and disappears down the corridor as You press yourself against the side of the tunnel and peer out onto the arena again. the girl asked if there was another challenger while taking center stage that you feel a large hand grab you by the shoulder as a huge gorilla shortly after drags you out onto the arena. the gorilla said he found one in a loud voice while also saying you were snooping around backstage as he was staring down at you and that You turn to see him and gulp hard, yet saying you experienced something backstage is when the girl soon decided to have you take center stage with one of their champions for the crowd quickly cheer their approval.<br />
<br />
You look around in terror and see that the gator and gorilla have been joined by other large animals as there was A kangaroo, a hippo, an eagle, a snake, a bear, an octopus even a T-rex that you quickly decided to be in a fight challenge of a four on on round match off against the crocodile, the kangaroo, a bear, and most impotently, the T.Rex. making this match as you even raised the stakes on who of them beats that by wining all the four round match offs is where you win the prize while it becomes lesser if you were to lose even one match, yet if you should to lose all the matches with the rule of default is where the ring mistress decides what you&#39;ll receive. while wishing for better wrestlers like the mighty lion, a tough honey badger, a proud tiger, and a wolf to name off a few that the audience of the crowd up roared and cheered on the match up you claimed as she approved of it and the crowd goes wild.<br />
<br />
it wasn&#39;t long after when the snake-man ushers you over and leads you off stage to the back area, where you were left in a locker-room that tells you to get change into what appears to be a wrestling singlet and closes the door. The singlet smelled like it&#39;s been used before with the musk of sweat and other scents clinging to the fabric that you wondered when it was last washed, still you didn&#39;t want to become a donkey or worse as you you did just as he told you while thinking about the match you just made. it was a tight fit, but slightly concerned about how little it covers your package while it preserves your modesty well enough as you didn&#39;t know any good wrestling moves is where you see a laptop that you soon Open it up to find some files on each of the wrestlers your facing.<br />
<br />
finding footage and stats on each fighter for the ring as you watched a few matches on their style is where you come up with strategy to counter each of their movements on how to win while deciding to spend the rest of the time warming up that it was some time later when the girl came into the locker-room with the snake-man, say it was time for your first match and wished you luck with a smile and leads you back out into the arena to face off one of the four fighters. you see your first of the four challengers waiting for you that Once you get into the ring is where you can see in all his glory was an anthro wrestling bear.<br />
<br />
entering the ring and being forced toward him to get a better look for he was lat least seven-feet tall and covered in black fur while his ursine head watches you approach in the ring, waiting as you felt him giving you a glare that he&#39;s wearing only a singlet like yours. seeing his large bulge as to yet see his powerfully muscled limbs, even under the fur coating them that ring mistress announced your arrival while reminding the crowd the match off you made when the audience of the crowd up roared and cheered on the match up you once claimed for they went wild for it.<br />
<br />
being pushed in from the snake-man later as the MC soon declares the match to start that when the bell rang once is when you only had a split second to react when your opponent rushes towards you with an amazing agility speed while he was belied by his size, yet you were smaller than what he was where the only skill you had to stop him were to roll away from the bear a couple of times for it was the you think you can avoid the rush and dodging his attacks. doing so that it wasn&#39;t long for your foe to realize this and decided to climb up on one of the four poles as he then body slam onto the mat and shacks the ring, which made him into a dazed while you then quickly Stand up when you think he was fast, but not smart. quickly, you pin him down that with three slam count outs from the referee is when you won your first match round off when the song &#39;your the best around&#39; by Joe esposito as the bell rang three times while the MC announced the winner in surprise, which was you when the bear-man soon rose up and out of his daze.<br />
<br />
after the MC speak again, saying it&#39;s time to see what our bear-man&#39;s punishment will be was then two huge, furry arms wrap around you as you expected him to change into a donkey, but nothing was happening that he then looks down on you with a sad look and lifts you up while The bear then carries you offstage and a hurry. To add insult to injury as the bear still has you in a hold is where He hefts you down a side hallway to what appears to be his dressing room and closes the door behind him that You try to squirm out from under him, but to no avail when he was soon rubbing his groin on the backside of the couch. you can tell he was getting hard while figuring You were not going anywhere as the bear continues to grind, but what came next surprised you that you didn&#39;t see it coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;punish me. you&#39;ve won, what&#39;s my punishment going to be? what i&#39;m doing now would of been you if I were to win for my prize, but I didn&#39;t. please, tell me. what is my punishment as i&#39;ll do anything, and i mean anything that i&#39;ll even let you keep me for a wrestling league start up back home. please, anything is better with you around then staying here and humping the couch, or those pour wrestlers that were turn into donkeys.&quot; You hear the beast speak while his muzzle quickly grabs the couch head area as in an intense state he was in that tears were falling out of him now.<br />
<br />
thinking on what his punishment will be as he was crying in torment, yet pleasure that he wanted to stop and do you. you wanted to possibly keep him that you were hesitant for a second before answering him on his punishment to be as you then thought of an idea to solve both of your problems. he slowed down to hear you speak that you soon told him his punishment to be.<br />
<br />
NOW-&quot;ok bear-man, stop what you&#39;re doing and listen up no what i&#39;m about to tell you as for your punishment will be!&quot; you said to him. he soon stops and hears you out, with fear in his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;your punishment is to have make me into a better fighter that once finish, you&#39;ll be my first wrestling league fighter starter up back at my place for i&#39;m going to keep you. do I make myself clear for you punishment?&quot; you said as his fear soon vanished and lowered his head in shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;if that is what my failer leads to be, then so be it.&quot; he said sadly, but you soon curated him to saying boss, sir, or master to you. understanding what you mean that he soon acknowledge your meaning and said sir to you as you both soon started your training for your next match.<br />
<br />
with one match won that your thoughts of being a donkey were now slim as it was an hour and a half till you were buff and ready for you next match. soon the mistress came in with the snake-man, with a bag in hand as she knew what his punishment was that she told him pack up for he was fired when she glares at you madly. saying that she now lost one bear fighter because of you, but made an extra match she made to replace the one she lost as you realized she now has another bear-man to replace the one she just lost to you.<br />
<br />
though she sighed and snapped her fingers that soon the bear-man with his pack bag in hand and vanish, fading from sight as he was shortly at your place while being your first ever wrestling league fighter starter up. shortly after, another bear-man simply moves right on in as this one was a grizzly type. feeling that the bear-man was going to be ok back home is when they shortly after lead you out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;you should feel lucky, now that you won just one match as you won&#39;t be turned into a donkey. still, you have three more to go as I can simply make you into something more fitting for you.&quot; she said angerly that she had to go through something for what you had done for the first bear-man, you somehow let him free from this place.<br />
<br />
leading you back to the ring and see your second fighter of the four challengers, waiting for you that once again is where you get into the ring. you can see in all of his glory that this time around, the wrestler you&#39;ll be facing was now an anthro crocodile. once in the ring that he seamed to be about 220 pounds in weight and is 7&#39;0&quot; tall that he looked almost like any alligator.<br />
<br />
&quot;thanks for the bear-man bro. wish you luck.&quot; the croc-man said while showing a hand out that you took and shake it.<br />
<br />
&quot;thanks, same to you. still, hope to see the out come of this in one piece.&quot; you said as you both prepare to fight.<br />
<br />
&quot;and here&#39;s your challenger, folks. for those who are just now coming here today with us is where he&#39;ll be fighting our four boys in a four on one round match off that he has won against our very own bear-man and gave his punishment as he&#39;s still on a one on one in each match as their are three more rounds to go. if he should lose, even by default is where the ring mistress here will see what he&#39;ll receive of a lesser prize, but if he win it all is where the the prize is all his. with that in mind, let the match. . . begin.&quot; the MC said that the audience of the crowd up roared and quickly cheered on the match up you once claimed as the crowd was going wild.<br />
<br />
looking back at the corner the croc-man was in that you quickly saw fear on his face. the same fear the bear-man showed before leaving to be at your home as you knew he too needed help, but how were you going to pull this off without fooling anybody? it wasn&#39;t long for the MC to start up the second match of the four rounds.</p>
