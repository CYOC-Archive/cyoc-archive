<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing Zossie did when she woke up was stumble downstairs and mix a smoothie while she blinked sleepy eyed at things. She sat down at the table and sipped her smoothie until the sugar hit her blood system and she perked right up. Rain still splattered against the windows but it didn’t faze Zossie that much. She instead walked back upstairs in the relatively early morning and changed into a pair of running shorts and a tank top with an old floppy disk emblem on it. She tied her hair back with a tie and filled a water bottle before slinging a coat on and walking out the door.<br />
<br />
Zossie didn’t bother with an umbrella and instead just walked for two blocks until she hit a little strip mall with eight stores in it. A Burger Palace loomed over everything aided by a liquor store, a Chinese restaraunt, a corner store, and most importantly a gym called Fitness Deluxe. Zossie entered and removed her damp jacket. The woman at the front didn’t even have to ask her for a pass and just kept reading a tabloid magazine. Zossie however put in headphones and let video game soundtracks pour over her ears. She turned on a treadmill and began to run on it. Her feet hit the ground while the main title theme for Dune Raider 2 hit her ears. The game had required her to buy a better graphics card to run and looked better than anything else she owned. She smiled in a content way as the music and her running picked up pace.<br />
<br />
Thoughts about her PC persisted and the thing sitting in her room began to grow more grandiose and well built as memories of her building it herself and ordering each part filled her mind like a haze. It became more customized with the interior visible. She recalled installing liquid cooling but as the theme for Water world, another high end Pc game, filled her ears it became even bigger. The liquid cooling part became more complex until it expanded it a massive size and things began to move in it. Fish at first but soon actual water plants, shrimp, and snails emerged. Cooling systems, extremely complicated machinery and some air coolers added themselves to it. It became a full blown tank built into her PC and she began daydreaming about it and it became even more complex. The fish tank part expanded as a landmass appeared. It was now on a new desk next to the monitors and the tank was heated by her PC and required the heating now. The island grew as plants became larger on it and movement began to emerge. Ants began to crawl about as a dead corpse of a cockroach appeared and they swarmed it becoming more complex and rare as they went. The fish became beautiful and exotic and a cockroach farm appeared. Suddenly her PC was separated into bits built up around this paladarium and it was the coolest thing she could imagine. She let her PC music roar over her ears as mobile apps deleted off her phone and all the game consoles became untouched by all but her dad. Zossie’s music rearranged so it was all PC games and her shirt shimmered and changed into the logo for Dune Raider 2. Her PC game lineup became phenominal and her knowledge about computers got so high that she often served as tech support at school gaining extra credit for setting up assembly’s. She also found a sudden interest in bugs and recalled days spent outside seeking them out. Her stomach shrunk in even more to an absolutely gorgeous degree and her muscles bulged a little. She was now fast and quick on her feet and a higher tan than her family showed that she spent a lot more time outdoors.<br />
<br />
Her body began to quiver as her breasts expanded and her ass became rounder. She grew slimmer and her hair turned black and got a little longer. She turned the treadmill up and her two hour workout became an hour long one and the reason changed. She was there in the winter quite often but she was now only there because it was raining. She had indeed flashed her ID at the front and as time wore on and she worked up a good sweat she began to turn things down and left the building at the usual time she did when it was raining.<br />
<br />
Zossie spent the walk home looking for weird bugs that had been forced out of their homes and she spent a good half hour turning rocks over in an empty lot near the schoolyard. Suddenly she had memories of being pushed away by other girls as a kid who would scream when she found spiders or grasshoppers. The boys had thought she was weird too and called her “Bugsy,” quite often. This had led to a lot of weekends spent playing video games and now Zossie was the girl she was today because of it.<br />
<br />
When she arrived home she took a shower. She stepped into the hot water and scrubbed her hair and body down until it was all lavender scented and clear of sweat and grime. She felt refreshed afterwards and her hands and fingernails were now clear of dirt from her searching earlier. She put deoderant on, brushed her teeth, and brushed her hair letting it fail down near her head, a fun raven colour she adored. Her mind drained of popular thought and friends eroded and were replaced by people she had met online. She entered her room and put on a pair of black Panties, and a matching bra topped with an equally dark tank top that had a picture of a cyber bug from Mytholog 3. White shorts were pulled up and her room became better lit for PC gaming and her bed made itself and became neat and tidy. Her floor became tidy and clear of debris and she generally became cleaner. She dug into her cockroach farm and pulled out a sizeable male before killing it and dropping it into the ant farm PC. Her shrimp were cleaning off the exoskeleton of a previous meal and her fish were eating drowned ants. She smiled at the movements before she sat down, pulled on a pair of headphones and turned her PC on. It lit up as she loaded up a game called, “Loot ‘n’ shoot” that she and her friends had been playing recently and began talking to a few over the mic.<br />
<br />
“My dumb brother is playing on the GameStation again, sorry about the noise,” Brock complained.<br />
<br />
“PC master race,” Kianna replied and Zossie just laughed at that knowing full well she wouldn’t be where she was without consoles.</p>
