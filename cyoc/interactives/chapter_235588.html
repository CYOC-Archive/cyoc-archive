<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The unfamiliar voice rang out in Jeff&#39;s head like the word of a goddess. A feminine tone that commanded Jeff&#39;s attention as his legs stepped off the treadmill on their own accord. Jeff looked towards Hannah&#39;s direction to see her in the same sort of daze as him. She had started walking straight towards the women&#39;s locker room and Jeff found himself following close behind her. A look played across Hannah&#39;s face that Jeff couldn&#39;t quite read. He settled on one of concern however. “Well this is it Jeff looks like the two of us are gonna be socks.” She shakily squeaked out.<br />
<br />
Jeff could tell she was trying to remain optimistic but even she was a little hesitant. “At least we&#39;re together.” Jeff said; trying to reassure her, and they did to some extent it seemed with Hannah shooting him a warm look.  As the pair continued their hypnotized march forward they watched in amazement as the exercise machines seemed to grow around them. Jeff knew instinctively however that they were the ones shrinking.<br />
<br />
 Hannah started stripping first as her shirt and sports bra were rapidly becoming too large for her. Jeff couldn&#39;t help but stare as her breasts were freed to the world, which Hannah noticed immediately. “Oh please Jeff, Are you gonna gawk at them all the time.” The two of them were blushing now as they both kicked off their sneakers. “Can you blame a guy?” Jeff responded defensively. “No, but I can expect a little something in return… lose the shorts sock boy.” Reluctantly Jeff&#39;s shorts fell to the floor not that he had much of a choice by this point they looked six sizes too big for him. <br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s cock was standing at full mast for all of the Gym to see. “Damn is that for me? or did you secretly have a foot fetish?” Hannah teased. “It&#39;s for you… I&#39;ve kinda got an aversion to feet actually.” Jeff responded truthfully. Hannah&#39;s eyes widened with a mix of embarrassment and pity at Jeff&#39;s honesty. “Well it won&#39;t be so bad you&#39;ll get used to it eventually I&#39;m sure, and we can only get worn like what? once a week max?.” It was now Hannah&#39;s turn to try and reassure Jeff as she found herself frantically trying to navigate the situation. “And you get to spend the rest of the time with me.” Jeff forced a smile in appreciation. “Well what about you, how are you feeling about all this?” The other soon-to-be-sock blushed a brighter shade than Jeff had thought possible. “Well actually…” It was then that she finally let go of her now far too large shorts and panties, revealing a huge wet stain and almost dripping pussy. “I&#39;m kinda a foot freak.”<br />
<br />
Jeff was so taken aback that he could only laugh in response. “Well damn I guess this really is your true calling huh.” By this point the pair were shrinking even more rapidly, and Jeff started to notice a change in their skin texture. Hannah&#39;s skin looked like it was made of a thick knit cotton the kind you&#39;d see on any normal sock. Her face, ass and pussy were turning a bright hot pink, while the rest of her body looked like pale white cotton. Jeff&#39;s skin started to mirror hers in color but in texture his skin appeared pilly and a seam formed across his face. “uh-oh looks like some-ones inside out.” Hannah teased. “Oh great, this couldn&#39;t get worse.” Jeff groaned as the pair finally made it to the entryway of the locker room.<br />
<br />
The two of them were less than a foot tall now as they turned into the pink tiled room that marked the women&#39;s side. Inside the pair saw a fit toned woman seated on a bench busy tying her shoes. She was rather tall for a woman at what Jeff guessed was 5’10” though it was hard to tell from his new height. Her skin was a warm caramel tone and her dark brown hair was in a neat pixie cut. Jeff didn’t quite recognize her but Hannah seemed to immediately. “Jeff, that&#39;s Amanda Freitas, she&#39;s a new rookie on the women&#39;s soccer team.” Unfortunately unlike his friend currently suffering from bi-panic, Jeff still wasn&#39;t familiar. “I take it you&#39;re a fan?” Any of the initial trepidation Hannah might have had, had all but evaporated at this point. “Are you kidding me yes… you have no idea she&#39;s good, like potentially Olympics level good.” The idea of being potentially worn on a world&#39;s stage wasn&#39;t exactly thrilling for Jeff, but he was happy for Hannah. At least she seemed thrilled. <br />
<br />
Just as Amanda was standing up Hannah called out to her. “Mistress! Mistress Amanda!” Hannah took off sprinting across the now humongous room. Jeff however was still desperately trying to fight against whatever was compelling his legs to march forward. “Oh what&#39;s this about?” Jeff noticed a very slight accent, latin american? Brazilian perhaps?. “Hi Mistress, my name is Hannah and this is Jeff and we heard you were in need of socks.” Amanda chuckled to herself. “Ah what a lifesaver I wasn&#39;t looking forward to working out in just my sneakers.” Jeff took one look at the woman&#39;s very worn, probably very smelly sneakers and felt like he&#39;d throw up.<br />
<br />
Jeff caught up to them just as Amanda sat back down to undo her shoe laces. The stench that was released as her foot was freed would have made Jeff&#39;s stomach turn if he hadn&#39;t been turned into a hollow sock person. “You guys don&#39;t mind the smell do you?” Jeff wanted to scream out disgust but Hannah spoke up before he had a chance. “Of course not Mistress, it&#39;s part of the job.” Amanda chuckled to herself as she picked the two of them up “well aren&#39;t you the eager little thing well you first then.” Jeff then watched from her lap in horror as Amanda shoved her entire foot into Hannah&#39;s ass. Steadily the little sock girl&#39;s body was stretched and contorted around the soccer player&#39;s foot. By the time she was pulled up past Amanda&#39;s ankles Hannah&#39;s arms and legs had seemingly melted away, making her look like any other crew sock. Without any fanfare or hesitation Hannah was then shoved into an awaiting sneaker leaving Jeff alone with their new owner. <br />
<br />
“Now you&#39;ve been quiet haven&#39;t you.” Jeff was staring up at her in fear now. “Yeah, do you think we could maybe take a raincheck on this? I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready.” Amanda just snickered to herself. “Now why should I?” She mused as she picked Jeff up by his legs. “I&#39;ve got practice and you can&#39;t expect me to play without socks can you?” Before Jeff could find the words to respond he felt his world drop rapidly as his new Brazilian goddess lowered him to her awaiting foot.<br />
<br />
The smell was the first thing to hit him. Jeff always hated the smell of feet and as the toes rapidly approached his face he felt he&#39;d hurl if his insides weren&#39;t made of cotton. Amanda&#39;s foot pressed unceremoniously into his face flattening it into its true shape: that of the bottom of her sock. Jeff found his tongue stretched out to meet her sole completely of its own volition. The taste was a salty cheesy taste that nauseated Jeff to his very soul. He had hoped that somehow, someway his sense of taste would be altered to make this more bearable but there was no such luck. Amanda&#39;s foot still tasted very much how you&#39;d expect a foot to taste. If anything it was worse since there was already a healthy film of sweat and grime coating her sole and soaking into his fabric. <br />
<br />
Amanda continued to unroll Jeff further onto her foot and in the process turning him inside out. Where you might expect his innards to be Amada revealed the outer fabric you would expect in any other sock. Once he was fully pulled no one looking would be able to see him as anything but. Not that anyone would anyway. As far as the universe, and everyone in it save perhaps the sock itself was concerned that was all Jeff was and would ever be.<br />
<br />
Jeff was in hell. His entire world had been shrunk down to this stranger&#39;s foot. All he could smell was her reeking sweat. All he could taste was her grimy discolored sole. It was too dark to see but if he could all it would be was her wiggling toes grinding into him and marking him as hers. Her heel ground in to a patch of fabric that had once been his genitals. Every step she would make would send him into an intense mixture of pleasure and pain.<br />
<br />
Hannah on the other hand was in Heaven. Her Mistress&#39;s foot had penetrated her deeper than she had ever dreamed possible instantly sending her into straight into an orgasm. Her face was being ground into the divine stain left by her goddess in her well-worn insole. She found herself excitedly kissing and tasting the dark sweat soaked pad beneath her. Hannah was thanking the heavens that her sense of taste and smell were unaltered. Before she had only ever sneaked a few wayward sniffs of her roommate&#39;s socks without her knowing, but this; this was a thousand times worse. There was no place better for a true foot freak like her.<br />
<br />
Ever since she was a little girl Hannah had known she&#39;d grow up to be foot-wear. If anything she was pissed this hadn&#39;t happened sooner. She even kept a tier list of all the best potential owners on campus. Amanda? Right up there in S-tier! Where else would the Brazilian super star with a reputation for the foulest smelling feet belong?<br />
<br />
The best part of all though was that Jeff was right there as well. She listened eagerly to his pathetic muffled screams of anguish get silenced even more as their owner stuffed him into other cleat. She relished each and every terrified note as she pictured his crying face. Her mind drifted back to how he had somehow mistaken her horny excitement for trepidation. She thought about how such a caring and well meaning guy was currently suffering at the feet of their goddess and she came a little. <br />
<br />
Hannah had always had a crush on poor little Jeff. Hell he had previously been pretty high on her tierlist. She had even invited him to these workout sessions in the hopes she might end up replacing a sneaker for him. This however was far more than she could ever ask for. She couldn&#39;t believe she had missed it! Jeff was meant to be a sock. It was a known study that the more extreme of an objects reaction to transforming the better it is at serving it&#39;s role. Clothes that either vehmetetly hate, or are incredibly turned on by being clothing have been shown to never fade, or wear out. Once those that truly oppose their new role are thoroughly forced into it; they&#39;ve been shown to out preform even their most accepting counter parts.<br />
<br />
Hannah was going to have a front row seat to that. She was going to watch as every soccer drill, every trip to the hamper, every night spent in a sock drawer would slowly break him. She would be right there to coax him along, mould him into a proper sock like her. Until eventually the pair of them would be indistinguishable just two socks both equally devoted to their owner&#39;s feet. Equally stained, permanently discolored by Amanda&#39;s feet. A perfect matching pair.<br />
<br />
Amanda admired her new socks for a moment as she finished shoving Lefty in her Cleat; maybe she&#39;d bother asking their names later. No time for that now though. She was late for practice; so she quickly finished lacing up her cleats, and dashed out of the locker room. Uncaring of how much each foot fall sent her sock further into their own respective heaven and hell. She had more important things to worry about than the feelings of her footwear after all.</p>
