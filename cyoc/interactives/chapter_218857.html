<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to ChronoSeth for this chapter. I edited.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, that was interesting.&quot; Finn said.<br />
<br />
The dragon watched Charles and his new husband fuck. Then they went about trying to stop Ajax, killing a whole lot of people to do so including Charlon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not QUITE what I had intended, though.&quot; Finn scratched his scaly chin.<br />
<br />
Below him, his new kobold... he couldn&#39;t recall the kobold&#39;s human name anymore, not like it mattered. Anyways, the new kobold was dutifully suckling Finn&#39;s massive draconic cock like he was a pro. Finn, of course, could come whenever he wanted, but right now he was more interested in seeing how things would have worked if things had turned out... differently.<br />
<br />
He rewound time and made a few adjustments to the settings of the Chronivac and hit enter.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
For a good two hours, Charles and his husband, Rodrigo, fornicated just like in the old days. <br />
<br />
The fatter wolf&#39;s cock was smaller than Charles&#39; meaty footlong, but it still managed to prod his prostate<br />
<br />
Charles relaxed as his husband pleasantly massaged his g-spot with his dick. He loved the fat mayor&#39;s big, soft, fluffy body, the way it jiggled as he thrust. The happy little yips and pants he made as he claimed Charles&#39; ass. It made Charles feel...happy. Charles felt his hole pulse and swallow Rodrigo&#39;s cock to the hilt.<br />
<br />
Both wolves moaned happily, their tails wagging in unison as they made love.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like having my meat inside you, big oaf?&quot; Rodrigo grinned, eyes glinting with an almost malicious light.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it, babe.&quot; Charles moaned, closing his eyes as the big wolf gave a thrust. &quot;You feel so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
They kissed hungrily, as though this were the first time they&#39;d had sex.<br />
<br />
A few thrusts later and they were both howling and cumming. Charles felt his husbands warmth splash his insides and shuddered in glee. They licked each other&#39;s muzzles lovingly before Rodrigo prestidigitation&#39;d the mess away.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Charles yawned as he stirred, his asshole clenching pleasurably from last night’s activities, and glanced at his fat husband as he snored away next to him.<br />
<br />
How long ago did they hitch it up together? Charles knew it had been decades since he married Rodrigo, but there was a sort of confusion in his mind. Didn’t he arrive in this world just recently? It was as if a fog was filling his brain. The clearer memories shined brighter in his head by default. <br />
<br />
Charles sighed, remembering his life here and every night he had loved Rodrigo.<br />
<br />
The fat wolf had first dibs on his ass, therefore he was the first of every night to fuck him raw. When the smaller wolf’s cock slipped into his clenching and tight hole, Charles groaned in pleasure as his asshole sucked in the smaller cock. His own footlong fucker twitched and waved in the heated air as Rodrigo pounded into his beloved husband.<br />
<br />
Rodrigo’s hot lupine cream filling his ass was the signal for the next part of the nightly activities.<br />
<br />
It was Rodrigo’s favorite part and Charles’ expected climax for the night. With Rodrigo’s potions, Charles’ footlong was thicker and the two old wolves went at it for the next hour and a half, with the added girth and mass quickly put to use deeply into the Mayor of Diamond Hollow’s ass. Rodrigo was the Mayor in name, but in reality, he depended on Charles for advice on how to control the masses, just like how the bigger wolf was ramming into the Mayor as he howled and growled like the cowardly bitch he is.<br />
<br />
Charles pinched his forehead in disappointment. <br />
<br />
Rodrigo had abducted him off the roads to train Callum, the adopted wolf son of Rodrigo. But once the fat Mayor saw Charles’ prowess and charisma, he was smitten. Performing the ritual to turn Callum into a full-blooded son of Charles and Rodrigo was one amazing night. That young wolf grew strong, but Rodrigo’s ego definitely got into him too. Cocky son of two wolves…<br />
<br />
The fact that his trained militias failed against the golems brought a deep growl in his chest. Years of banditry and unified pack tactics, with Rodrigo&#39;s magic bringing in more pups to train, and Ajax Kinderschredder shredded them. Now they served that stupid old pitbull as his personal warriors!<br />
<br />
Fucking Paranese mages and their tailoring powers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another day to try and defeat this Paranor mage.&quot; Charles sighed as he prepped for the day, his footlong getting caught in his pants. Why did he let Rodrigo use the potion on him last night? In a dungeon no less?<br />
<br />
Waking his husband by hotdogging that fat ass, Charles growled into Rodrigo’s ears and playfully bit the smaller wolf. &quot;Come on, we oughta get to the others and get you to safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
The smaller wolf moaned at the hot sausage between his buns, turning around to lick Charles on his face. &quot;Good morning, stud.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles responded by aligning his prick to his hole and thrusting in. <br />
<br />
Rodrigo moaned and tried to drag himself off. &quot;I&#39;m awake, I&#39;m awake!&quot;<br />
<br />
The bigger wolf pulled out and wore his tight cloak, the sleeves barely holding his bulk. &quot;Good, let&#39;s get a move on…&quot;<br />
<br />
“Goodness, I love you so much, Charles.” Rodrigo moaned his name sleepily as he groggily set off to suit up for the day. “I’m happy to have met you when I abducted you.”<br />
<br />
Charles huffed at that, forcing his paws into gloves that were as tight as the pants he was wearing now. Thanks to Rodrigo’s potion not yet worn off, the DILF wolf was going out commando. <br />
<br />
“Chain of fate, us meeting like that.” Charles grinned.<br />
<br />
The wolf daddy had a moment of confusion once again because there was an innate feeling that he shouldn’t be married to another. But he pushed it aside once he slipped on his boots, tying them up and stomping down to force them to fit. It was so weird, all his clothes were so frustratingly tight! Had the water shrunk them when Rodrigo had washed and dried them?<br />
<br />
Charles dismissed it as irrelevant, he could function just fine the way he was now.<br />
<br />
Both of them dressed up and cleared their place, reaching the stairs where they could return to the main chambers. It didn&#39;t take long nor was it eventful, other than evading pitbull warriors or outright sneak attacking them down. Shadowblur was out, turning the surroundings a shade of black darker and revealing threads of shadows attached to the pitbulls. When Charles slashed at the threads, the pitbull warriors were consumed by darkness, only to reveal an unconscious wolf. <br />
<br />
He couldn’t strike down all of them, and in the end, he had only managed to return just three wolves to his pack. <br />
<br />
Charles chose to rescue Hedge, a lithe wolf that was able to run through forests as fast as he could. Logger, a strong lumberjack wolf that was more used to the axe than the dagger, and Faust, one of his wolves that was great with diplomacy and bargains. All of them were exhausted and confused. Hedge was shivering from the transformations and identity death.<br />
<br />
To Charles, the fact that his wolf warriors turned into dumb brutes irritated him. Bringing them along, the alpha wolf lead the pack as Rodrigo walked at ease with three new bodyguards.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, he reached the familiar hub room that had paths leading everywhere. Behind him lay the processing chamber and the secret passage to the secret room where he received Shadowblur and one bearish Ranger turned into an axe. To his left was the ruined room that had once held Rodrigo. Ajax&#39;s arena lay in the next chamber, the pitbull likely lounging upstairs.<br />
<br />
It was easy to find where the party had gone to take a rest, following the muddy and dusty footsteps to the room where the taxidermies were.<br />
<br />
Charles turned the corner only to bump into a small hornless stag. Said hornless doe smashed into Charles&#39; flab and was flung to the floor. The stag, seeing a massive wolf, scampered backward only for the other Rangers to turn towards them, startled, their paws reaching for their weapons.<br />
<br />
From the look of things, the party was preparing to move on to the next room.<br />
<br />
The inventories were packed, Veles the cougar wizard was reading magical tomes, and Geoffrey the massive polar bear bodyguard was still wearing the shoes that had once been Jeff. Palseks the kobold Bard stared at Charles as he approached, her slitted eyes wide. Gregory, the lithe mink prince, was sitting next to a massive wolfdog with pitbull features, spotted white fur, and a thick, brawny body.<br />
<br />
Charles assessed the situation. Who was this stag boi? Who was that wolfdog sitting with his friends?<br />
<br />
Wait… friends?<br />
<br />
Charles couldn&#39;t remember why they were his friends, but he had a nagging feeling that he should remember!<br />
<br />
Decades of having Rodrigo as his husband shone brightly in his head. There was no other life, but why was there a feeling in his soul that he needed to return to his friends?<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re back.&quot; The Pitwolf smirked, his deep, bassy voice rumbling in his chest as he looked at Charles. &quot;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re confused. I’m Charlon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlon?<br />
<br />
Charles cautiously walked into the room. The rangers hesitated, their hands still on their weapons, before Charlon signaled them to back down. All of the Rangers returned to their duties. The party, however, was looking at both Charlon and Charles. <br />
<br />
Charles and Rodrigo and the three wolves behind them moved over to a spot near Charlon where it was cleared. The Rangers glared at the small pack of wolves and Rodrigo, animosity clear in their eyes. Charles felt another pang of confusion. Why would anyone hate his beloved husband? <br />
<br />
The Rangers growled and Charles’ handpicked crew growled back before Charlon and Charles shushed them into silence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Two Charlies?&quot; Palseks confusedly muttered as she stared.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is… weird. I know Charlon was Charlie&#39;s character, but I feel like you are Charlie&#39;s character too. Who are you?&quot; Veles spoke out, standing as he walked closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Charles, Diamond Hollow&#39;s advisor, and husband to Rodrigo here. But I&#39;m also Charlie?&quot; Charles was confused. He had no memories of these people, yet they felt familiar. And Charlie…that was a casual nickname he’d adopted in his adventuring days before he’d settled down with his husband.<br />
<br />
 The party still seemed vaguely familiar, but this Charlon fellow stood out. Who the hell was he and why did Charles have the feeling that the Pitwolf had stolen his friends from him? <br />
<br />
Taking out Shadowblur, Charles growled out at Charlon. &quot;You, who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolfdog grinned, sharp teeth glistening as his muscular form rippled with vascularity. &quot;I am Charlon, and I am also Charlie. Ajax&#39;s betrayer and Paranor&#39;s strongest warrior.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Impossible. I’m Charlie!” Charles replied, his hackles raised.<br />
<br />
“Not only am I Charlie but that dagger is also a Charlie. We’re all failures here.” The wolfdog hefted a mighty battle axe to his shoulders. &quot;But if you’re looking for a fight, I will do so. My Ursa Major versus your Shadowblur. What say you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles gripped his dagger to see the world darken, threads of shadows appearing around anyone or anything transformed by the dungeon&#39;s machinations, as seen by the thread attached to the pitbull warriors and the wolfdog himself. However, the black threads on this Charlon were interweaved by a golden thread, and instinctually, Charles knew it was Finn&#39;s intervention that this character was here.<br />
<br />
Finn! Oh! The memories of the dragon rushed back to him. Of course that meddlesome dragon had a hand in this!<br />
<br />
The three groups watched in suspense as Charles considered Charlon’s challenge. If what the pitwolf was saying was true, then Finn was behind it all. Fucking dragon!<br />
<br />
He sighed, sheathing his dagger away. &quot;You&#39;re here to help, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
The wolfdog smiled. &quot;Correct. I may be from Paranor with close contact with Ajax, but I betrayed him when he betrayed me. Finn returned me from a bad end to help you all.&quot; Charlon stood up and walked over, the brute of muscle and himself of bulk standing of equal height.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may have Charlie&#39;s soul.&quot; The big wolfdog grinned as Charles thought about it. “But I have his mind. His memories as a Player.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Two sides of the same coin,&quot; Charles remarked with realization. Charlon himself reached out for a hug and Charles could only return it as he knew Finn was helping them. Altruism? Maybe not, but at least he was helping, even if it was for his own gain. He felt Charlon’s heavy muscles squeeze him tight. “Whoa! You’re pretty strong for a…wolf…?” <br />
<br />
“Wolfdog. Part pitbull, part wolf. Not a common hybrid but it’s how I came into being, formerly Charon, trimmed by Glitz to become Charlie, and partially reverted and merged into me, Charlon.” The wolfdog grinned, flexing just to show off his strength. “What about you? What’s your backstory?”<br />
<br />
Charlie could clearly remember his backstory, and in hindsight, it definitely felt like he was living the life of an NPC rather than a player with connections to organizations. He was 25 when he was abducted by Rodrigo, and forced to train his adopted son in ways of the blade and banditry. However, he and the fat wolf fell in love and they fucked, married, and stayed loyal to each other for decades. <br />
<br />
He was 45 years old now, old enough to have multiple children and to be called a senior. The pups he trained and the town he advised were developed by him. Rodrigo was a figurehead, he was the one that made everything run as smoothly as he intended.<br />
<br />
“I am Rodrigo’s husband, advisor to him in running the town of Diamond Hollow.” Charles made it short and simple. There was no need to divulge too much information, even if his twin was here. The Rangers were going to be a thorn in his pack’s thorn, he could tell from their aggressive demeanor. Thankfully, they seemed to be more concerned with the curse on Rodrigo than Charles shadow-puppeting the town. Charlon taking authority over the group was odd, but there was no feeling of wrongness there.<br />
<br />
Oswin tottered in and collapsed in Charlon’s lap, taking the Pitwolf’s cock in his mouth and casually sucking on it in the middle of their conversation. <br />
<br />
That was rather rude-<br />
<br />
Wait a second, Charles&#39; eyes narrowed as he thought. Was Oswin really that thin and boyish? Hadn’t he been a big lumberjack? <br />
<br />
Before he could ask Charlon about it, the pitwolf grinned, turning around to address the party and the Rangers. <br />
<br />
“Alright, Charles here is our ally. He’s my closest associate if you know what I mean.” The wolfdog fist-bumped Charles and he begrudgingly returned it.<br />
<br />
Charles managed to shake off his feelings of unease and focused on the task at hand.<br />
<br />
He took a moment and critically assessed the raid group that would be striking down Ajax. The Rangers were already packed up and all of them looked ready to fight. His pack of Rodrigo, Hedge, Logger, and Faust, however, were sitting by the dying embers of a fire. They looked tired and traumatized. But they seemed to be keeping their heads up, just like how he trained them to be tough and strong.<br />
<br />
Then, there was the party that should be with him. All of them were done packing up and were ready to move, though they were shooting him odd stares. It made him self-conscious and more than a little uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
“What?” Charles finally snapped at Palseks.<br />
<br />
“Charles is Charlie?” Palseks walked forwards to look at the DILF version of Charlie, walking around him in circles to inspect him. Charles could only look over her head, feeling disconnected yet close.<br />
<br />
“Finn had been sending versions of ourselves that failed at many points in time to help the main party,” Charlon spoke up, explaining himself. “I failed and was sent back with a new backstory as Charon turned Charlie. That dagger was Charlie that was turned into an artifact to defeat Ajax.”<br />
<br />
“You mean there are other versions of us that failed,” Geoffrey spoke up looking at his boots. “Stuck in a state waiting for anyone to find them?”<br />
<br />
Gregory looked at the boots that held Jeff with disdain, but the idea that there was a version of him out there that was turned into something else kept him from voicing his negative opinion of the ‘disgusting fat bear wizard’.<br />
<br />
“It’s probable that Finn wanted it to be like that. That each end still contributed to a main timeline.” Veles spoke up from his studies. The muscular cougar was getting ready for a Trim spell that was more risky.<br />
<br />
“Very much likely. Each of us can be split into multiple versions running a different story.” Veles continued, knowing from his knowledge of backstories being so easily altered. A realization entered his head. “Each story becomes his to play around with…”<br />
<br />
<br />
“His hoard.” Palseks spoke up. With how she’s the most well-versed as a kobold, she could connect it quickly. “Everyone is Finn’s hoard.”<br />
<br />
The whole group took a second of processing the revelation. <br />
<br />
Oh goodness. <br />
<br />
<i>Had Finn given the same quest to all other versions of himself?</i><br />
<br />
Charles thought about it. Was Finn just playing around with him, or is his version the best chance of saving Jeff?<br />
<br />
Wouldn’t that mean there’s a version of Jeff that Finn was happy with?<br />
<br />
Not wanting to depress himself even further, Charles sighed and walked to Veles. Seeing the cougar with tan fur preparing to cast a spell, the wolf DILF spoke up. “Are you preparing to Trim yourself back to normal?”<br />
<br />
Veles nodded, hands tracing symbols to get ready. “It’s something to Trim another. It’s another subject to Trim yourself.” <br />
<br />
Charles nodded at the answer. Veles would be back to his full strength once he was done, and they could get ready to defeat Ajax.<br />
<br />
“I have a plan that would be great to have,” Charlon announced to the whole group. “I know how to make you Rangers stronger. We will use Ajax’s machinations against him.”<br />
<br />
“How?” One lithe ranger called Camden spoke up. <br />
<br />
“The Warrior Conversion room. There are two parts to it.” Charlon grinned, flexing his biceps. “One part is the physical change, and the other changes the mind. I can take out the second part, and Veles can Trim you to fit the body.”<br />
<br />
“Isn’t that dangerous?” Zueler spoke up. “I trust you know what you’re doing, but really?”<br />
<br />
“Yes! The golems of Ajax don’t really check if your mind serves Ajax. It’s how I can pass through easily.” Charlon smiled easily. <br />
<br />
Veles cast the spell on himself. “Trim!”<br />
<br />
========================================================================<br />
<br />
Veles looked at his own backstory and character sheet. He could see there was an addition to his story where Ein possessed him and the axe’s magic transformed him into a vessel for Ein. It would be easy to just remove the parts that affected him into a copy of Ein. <br />
<br />
As he put a finger on his sheet, he started swiping words.<br />
<br />
A ghostly muscular arm of a cougar touched his sheet. Veles could only gasp as Ein surged into his sheet.<br />
<br />
“W-wai-”<br />
<br />
========================================================================<br />
<br />
“Velein?” A voice spoke to him.<br />
<br />
Velein jumped, startled, and turned to see Charles standing over him.<br />
<br />
“Velein, are you good?” Charles asked him from his haze of dizziness. He cast the spell, had it succeeded? “It’s okay! You did it! You’re back to normal again.”<br />
<br />
He could see the old wolf crouched over him, a cold but concerned look on his face schooled by years of professional town management. He took the help when a thick arm reached out for him, pulling his muscular biceps for him to sit up.<br />
<br />
Looking over himself, he nodded at his first self-Trim success. Sculpted white-furred arms connected to the thick shoulders that he knew he should have. He looked down at his body to see boxy pecs covered by silken wizardly robes. <br />
<br />
The foxy white-furred cougar smiled at Charles. “Yeah, I think I’ll manage.”<br />
<br />
“Great to see you back, Velein. Now, let’s get to buffing our party up.” Charlon raised a fist in the air and shouted. “Down with Ajax Kinderschredder!”<br />
<br />
“Down with Ajax!” The whole Ranger group shouted together. <br />
<br />
Charles sighed and smiled. “I can see us making it.”<br />
<br />
Velein could only grin.</p>
