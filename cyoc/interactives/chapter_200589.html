<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After giving this choice a good few minutes to contemplate, Tina had finally made her decision. She wanted to try out being a pair of breasts. When she thought of which category she wanted to do, she decided to go with the &quot;Reality Change&quot; option. She figured that it meant the world would shift around her, so while she was in her titular state her mother wouldn&#39;t worry about her not picking up the phone. She figured she would still be in control of the situation, able to change herself back on the fly whenever she wanted. Soon she would find out, that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.<br />
<br />
She finally made her move and clicked the button. At first she felt nothing, but she soon found herself feeling disoriented. Her vision started to fade, meaning she couldn&#39;t read the message that just popped up on the screen. Tina fell unconscious for an undetermined amount of time, but when she woke up she found herself in a place that somehow felt familiar and foreign at the same time. She looked around for a few seconds before it hit her. &quot;It&#39;s my old room&quot; she thought to herself. For some reason she found herself in her old room in her mother&#39;s house, but something seemed different. Not only was her bed replaced with an old couch, but the television in the room was ancient. This room looked straight out of the nineties, which gave her an unnerving feeling. She tiptoed throughout the house, only illuminated by the moonlight beaming through the windows, when she felt compelled to go to her mother&#39;s room. She slipped through the door to find her mother fast asleep. Upon further inspection of the room she found a calendar posted to the wall dated sometime in January 1989. This caused her further confusion. &quot;Did I click the time travel option by accident?&quot; She thought to herself. &quot;1989, that&#39;s 11 years before I was born&quot; she thought. &quot;I have to be careful so I don&#39;t change anything, but how will I get back to-&quot; her thoughts were interrupted when she peered over at her mother, who appeared to be completely naked with the covers pulled down, revealing her large breasts that Tina knew all too well. Unable to concentrate on the situation at hand, she creeped towards her mother who was still in a deep sleep and kneeled down next to the bed. She stared at her large breasts as everything exited her mind in the moment except for one thing: milk. She slowly moved in and started suckling from her mother&#39;s teat, being ever so gentle to her nipple. She knew this wasn&#39;t right but she couldn&#39;t stop, it felt like natural instinct had taken over and it felt amazing. As she continued to suck, she felt confused as it felt like everything inside her mouth had vanished-or perhaps merged. This didn&#39;t matter to her all too much in the moment, so she continued as she felt her face getting closer and closer to her mother. She snapped out of her trance and realized what she was doing, and tried to pull away but felt a strong resistance. She was stuck to her mother&#39;s breast. She panicked and tried to make any sort of sound, but no matter what happened her mother remained asleep. She looked over at the other breast and felt another surge of excitement, yet again disregarding any negative connotation from the situation at hand. She wriggled until she was on top of her mother in the bed, and moved towards the other breast. She was able to open her mouth just enough to fit the other nipple in, suckling from both and feeling immense satisfaction. She was so entrances by the feeling that she didn&#39;t even notice that her body had begun to change. Her arms melded to her body and seemingly vanished, as her legs merged together and started caving in towards her body. She had no idea what was happening, but she didn&#39;t care because the only thing that brought her any joy in that moment was sucking on her mother&#39;s breasts. When her legs had completely vanished, her entire lower half started to compress in a way that was bringing her behind closer to her head. As this happened her pants and panties slid off of her, but she paid this no mind. As her bottom creeped up more and more it finally collided with her own breasts, forming a mass that wasn&#39;t recognizable anymore. At this point Tina had devolved into a strange, squishy mass with a head, but she didn&#39;t mind at all. It finally came time to truly transform. As she continued so suckle she felt her face merge with the breast tissue and her jaw bones seemingly disappear. She could no longer suckle on anything, and that brought her to her senses, although it was far too late to change course. Tina&#39;s face began merging with both breasts as her bottom mass collided with her head. She felt the weirdest sensations from this, things she couldn&#39;t describe even if she still had a mouth. She felt her view shifting as the mass and breasts were reshaping themselves until things stabilized for a moment. No longer was Tina staring at her mother&#39;s luscious breasts and suckling on them, but she was staring at the ceiling. She could still move her eyes and rock her &quot;body&quot; back and forth slightly, but she couldn&#39;t do much else. At this point she realized she didn&#39;t have any defining features except for her eyes, she couldn&#39;t hear or smell anything. She also couldn&#39;t breathe, but she found that she didn&#39;t need to breathe anymore. As she attempted to struggle she felt more changes starting. What felt like her face began to split in half down what she perceived to be the middle, although she didn&#39;t really know what was what anymore. She felt herself being split more and more as time went on, until it came up to her eye level. Tina felt a sharp pain in her &quot;head&quot;, as if she had a splitting headache. She then realized that her physical brain was being split in two, and she began to panic internally. The splitting continued and felt extremely painful for a few seconds, until it finally worked its way through her brain and finished. As her brain physically split she felt very strange, there was no more pain but something felt wrong. &quot;What&#39;s happened to me&quot; she thought. &quot;What&#39;s happened to me&quot; she heard herself say again internally. She then realized that her brain was completely split in two, and every though she had was echoed by the opposing half of her brain. This made Tina feel very disoriented, so much so that she couldn&#39;t even focus on looking at anything. The mix of the echoing thought plus the visualization of the room she was in was too much to handle, so she closed her eyes to try and get a handle on everything. That&#39;s when the next change started. When she closed her eyes it just felt right, as if this is how it was meant to be. She composed her thoughts somewhat and could finally focus on what she was feeling physically. She felt very soft, and when she moved herself slightly it felt as if she was bouncing on both halves. She giggled to herself internally and kept bouncing, as it was the only action she could perform and it felt good. She felt a strange sensation on her now-closed eyes, but it wasn&#39;t enough to distract her from the bouncing. Her eyes had essentially melded with the mass, and her eyelids soon turned into soft, pink patches with a defined tip. Tina felt some excitement as she started to feel what was formerly her eyes, and it was an extremely pleasurable sensation that they gave off. Her brain(s) inside the masses shrunk considerably over the course of the last few changes, leaving Tina feeling a little ditzy. &quot;Where I&#39;m at?&quot; she thought to herself, unable to construct logical sentences in her own mind. &quot;I remember mommy&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;mommy&#39;s boobies? Big boobies, that&#39;s right.&quot; She bounced slightly, giggling internally yet again. &quot;Am mommy&#39;s boobies, make lots milks&quot; she thought, &quot;boobies no think, only milk.&quot; Her mind began degrading rapidly as her brain kept shrinking until both halves were each the size of a grape inside the large masses. &quot;Milk... Milk... Milk...&quot; her final thoughts went as her brains contorted, becoming a series of nearly microscopic glands in her body. The clothes she had on before this debacle started had long since vanished, all except for the bra she had bought weeks prior. The transformation was complete. Where an overly-eager Tina once lay was now a very well-endowed woman who would soon give birth to her first and only child, a beautiful baby boy. As she slept her gigantic breasts were already hard at work, the mammary glands fulfilling their one and only purpose: produce milk.</p>
