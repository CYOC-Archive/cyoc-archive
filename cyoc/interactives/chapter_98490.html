<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick Plunkett pulled over and checked the directions to the Moon Lake hotel again. It was getting close to nightfall and he didn&#39;t want to be trying to find it in the dark. Besides he wanted to get to bed early so he could get a head start on trying to spot the Sasquatch that was supposed to be here. He didn&#39;t really have much hope that he&#39;d spot it since the photo appeared online this close to Halloween and was probably just a gimmick the town thought up to try and increase tourism, if there was any tourism anyway. Well it didn&#39;t really matter to him one way or the other if there was a Sasquatch here as he needed to take his vacation time. When he had read about Moon Lake on the internet it seemed to be a nice place to go for his vacation so here he was.<br />
<br />
It was just turning dark when he found the hotel. It wasn&#39;t very big being only two stories and having perhaps a total of 40 rooms if he had to guess. Of course there wouldn&#39;t be an elevator in this hotel but that was alright, he could use the exercise since he was a bit out of shape. Ok so at the age of 40, standing five foot eight, and weighing about one hundred eighty pounds he was more than a bit out of shape. Deciding not to dwell on that though he entered the hotel lobby and went up to the front desk. The lobby itself seemed to have a bit of a rustic quality to it even having an actual fireplace in one wall. He figured that they may light it on holidays since there were chairs and sofas arranged in front of it. As he approached the front desk a girl, she couldn&#39;t be more than nineteen, came out from a back room with a smile saying, &quot;Welcome to Moon Lake. How may I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick glanced at the name badge she wore which said her name was Mary before smiling and saying, &quot;I would like a room please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Mary said still smiling and punched some things into a computer. &quot;How long will you be staying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking about a week or maybe two depending on if I find what I came here to see,&quot; Really city said thinking it over just a bit.<br />
<br />
Mary continued to smile as she entered more information and said, &quot;You&#39;re in luck sir. We do have a room available for that length of time. It will be seventy dollars a night. I&#39;ll put you in for two weeks but you are free to check out before that and only be billed for the nights you stay. Now will you be paying with cash or credit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Credit,&quot; Rick said as he handed Mary his card. He was a little bit surprised that they would take cash but then again maybe it wasn&#39;t so surprising given what he had read about this town. He had read that everyone here was friendly and the crime rate was really low.<br />
<br />
Mary handed his card back to him and a key saying, &quot;You&#39;re in room 213. Enjoy your stay. Oh and just out of curiosity what did you hope to see?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick took his card and the key, it was an actual key instead of a keycard, while saying, &quot;Thank you and I&#39;m hoping to see a Sasquatch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A Sasquatch?&quot; Mary asked a slight hesitancy in her voice and a puzzled expression on her face.<br />
<br />
Rick smiled and brought out his phone to show Mary the picture. &quot;Now according to the person who posted this picture they took it somewhere around here a few days ago,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Mary looked at it closely before saying, &quot;It&#39;s probably a couple of high school kids playing a prank. You can&#39;t tell how big it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick nodded before saying, &quot;It may be just a couple of high schoolers playing a prank but if so they should be more careful. There are quite a few people trying to prove that Sasquatch exists and unfortunately it&#39;s going to take a body for their existence to be proven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you see one are you going to kill it?&quot; Mary asked looking a little frightened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not unless it&#39;s trying to kill me,&quot; Rick said as he walked out to pull his car around back and go to his room.<br />
<br />
Mary&#39;s smile turned into a frown as she mumbled, &quot;That better not have been you Adam.&quot; She sighed and dialed a number. After a few seconds someone answered and she said, &quot;We may have a problem. A normal just checked in saying he wanted to see a Sasquatch and he showed me a picture. Some dumb weregorilla got himself photographed.&quot;<br />
<br />

A short time later Rick was running through the forest at an incredible speed for him. Trees were whizzing past him as he ran and dodged trees with a grace he didn&#39;t know he possessed. He could feel the leaves under his paws, his tail held out behind him, and his breasts bouncing as he ran. He had the need to get someplace fast and meet someone. His heart gave a little flutter as he burst into a clearing and slowed down before looking around. A twig snapped and he whirled toward the sound as a Sasquatch came into the clearing as well. &quot;Well there&#39;s my little cheetah wife to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And there&#39;s my big gorilla husband to be,&quot; Rick all but purred. &quot;Now how did you beat me here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was already here,&quot; the gorilla said.<br />
<br />
Rick placed his hands on his hips and said, &quot;Well that isn&#39;t fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gorilla closed the gap between them and scooped Rick into his arms saying, &quot;Life isn&#39;t fair but these past three years have been the best in my life though I almost wish you had asked you while you were still in high school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick smiled putting his furry arms around the gorilla&#39;s neck and saying, &quot;Now you know my adopted parents wanted me to wait until I at least graduated high school again to get married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know and I&#39;m glad you did wait,&quot; the gorilla said before kissing Rick as best as a gorilla and a cheetah could.<br />
<br />

Rick woke with a bit of a start. It was still nighttime and he laid in the bed thinking over his dream. He could understand him being female and younger as he had always believed he should have been born a girl and born at a much later date. However he couldn&#39;t figure out why he would be an anthropomorphic cheetah. He was still trying to figure that part out when he fell back asleep.</p>
