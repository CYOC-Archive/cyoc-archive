<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Stormwolf for the chapter!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The hippogriff slowly stirred, opening his eyes and raising himself up to all fours. He looked around the room in confusion. Where was he? How exactly did he get here? One look at the broken doors was all it took for him to remember. The tower, the stairs, the mirrors…everything.<br />
<br />
“You’re finally awake,” a voice said, making the hippogriff turn his head. Sitting in a chair in the corner of the small room was a young woman wearing a silver dress with hair dyed a pretty light blue. She stared at the hippogriff with a small, compassionate smile on her face.<br />
<br />
“I’m so happy you’re alright,” she said, standing up and approaching the hippogriff. “I don’t know who you are or why you decided to climb the tower, but because of your brave actions, I have been freed.”<br />
<br />
The beast squawked in confusion. Who the hell was this woman? Why was she trapped up here in the tower like some kind of princess in a fairy tale? The woman seemed to notice the creature’s confusion and simply placed her hand on his head, calming him down.<br />
<br />
“Allow me to introduce myself,” the woman said. “My name is Sophia. I know that you have many questions, and they will all be answered in due time. First, we must give you a proper body so you are able to speak. Unfortunately, I am unable to do so, but I know someone who can. I have overheard the guards talking about a place in town where a book user is. If anyone can help you, it’s them. Take me there, and I’ll see to it that you are changed back to your former self.”<br />
<br />
The hippogriff nodded, crouching down so Sophia could climb onto him. She wrapped her arms around his neck and Todd began to run down the stairs. Because he was running so fast, it didn’t take him long to get to the bottom and run out the front doors. As soon as he was outside, he followed his instincts and opened his wings, flapping them to get off the ground. He took off, soaring into the night sky.<br />
<br />
“The person you seek is currently in Studio Village!” Sophia, making sure the hippogriff could hear her over the sound of the wind rushing by them. “I’ll guide you there to the best of my ability!”<br />
<br />
Todd squawked in understanding and continued to fly.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=--===-=-=---==-<br />
<br />
The hippogriff gracefully landed in the front yard of a rather elegant-looking mansion that was cut right into the face of the mountain. Both Sophia and Todd could hear loud music and voices coming from the backyard. The woman groaned as she climbed off the hippogriff’s back.<br />
<br />
“They’re throwing a fucking party?!” she growled under her breath. “Why the hell are these people so horny all the damn time?” Todd squawked, and the woman pet him on the head gently. “We’ll get you fixed, I promise. Follow me closely, okay?”<br />
<br />
They passed by an old, out-of-shape but well-hung bugbear, naked and snoring on a deckchair with his half-chubbed cock leaking precum onto his beergut. They stepped carefully around the pile of empty ale bottles at his feet. Sophia took a towel and gently threw it over the bugbear’s prone form.<br />
<br />
Todd cocked his head at her.<br />
<br />
“He must be in pain if he’s out here all alone while a party goes on in the back.” Sophia shrugged. “I know how that feels.”<br />
<br />
Sophia led Todd around the side of the house towards the back, where the mountain opened up into a concealed grotto, replete with a natural waterfall into a small lake. Along the shores of the lake, the two of them were presented with what could only be described as a sex party. Creatures of all shapes and sizes, from kobolds to minotaurs, were partying and having sex like there was no tomorrow. There were a few humans here and there, but none of them seemed too alarmed by the myriad of mythical creatures.<br />
<br />
As the pair began to make their way onto the deck where most of the people were, a man stepped in front of Sophia, stopping her in her tracks. <br />
<br />
“Hey there baby…” the man said, a slight slur in his voice. He’d clearly had one too many to drink. “You lookin’ sexy tonight…You wanna fuck?”<br />
<br />
“With you?” Sophia scoffed. “Hard pass.” <br />
<br />
She pushed past the man, but he quickly got back in her way.<br />
<br />
“Hey…that’s no way to treat a fella who wants to show a chick a good time,” the man slurred. “I was the stunt-cock for Edward Penishands, left middle-cock, and the guy Hom Tanks tripped over and accidentally sucked to completion while storming the beaches of Normandy in Shaving Ryan’s Privates.”<br />
<br />
“Those are…gay roles, you realize that?” Sophia shook her head in confusion.<br />
<br />
“No, no! I mean, yeah, but straight guys have to do some gay porn to get by in this industry. Look, I just landed a lead role in Pocahotass. I’m Steve Bennett, the guy who plays Long John Smith?” The man fumbled with his phone and brought up a rather loud and lewd scene from a porno. “See! I’m all up and colonizin’ that pussy. You’ll fuckin’ love it. Hell, your weird dog can join in if it wants.” <br />
<br />
Sophia rolled her eyes and clocked the man.<br />
<br />
“Okay…that’s a no…” Steve clutched his jaw, tasting copper, and stumbled away.<br />
<br />
As Todd and Sophia walked past him, neither of them seemed to notice that the man’s figure was beginning to rapidly change. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
<br />
Steve rubbed his strangely smooth jaw, feeling cold chills shoot up his spine. He tripped on his out of his suddenly too-large shoes. His pants slipped down to his feet, taking his boxers with them. Steve kicked them off in panic. Was he shorter? Why were his clothes falling off him? His shirt reached down to his thighs, allowing him to maintain some semblance of decency.<br />
<br />
He glanced down his shirt just in time to see the last of his body-builder physique dwindle away, all of his substantial chest hairs falling out, leaving him with a slim, smooth body. Steve shakily ran one small, feminine hand up to his chest, feeling his impossibly smooth skin and gasped as he touched a painfully sensitive nipple. He pulled on it, the skin around the nipple darkened, the skin bubbling up until it sat atop a soft, puffy areola. The puffy areola grew thick, tenting his Polo shirt. Wet spots formed as his sensitive nipples rubbed against the rough fabric, soaking it.<br />
<br />
As he was preoccupied with his budding breasts, Steve cringed as his testicles pulsed painfully, emptiness blooming just beneath them. Waves of hot and cold struck him, knocking his breath out of him. He tucked a few stray strands of hair behind his ear, panting. He stumbled, hips widening, giving him curves.<br />
<br />
Movement on his chest caught his eyes. His new fat nipples lazily shifted and filled. The nipples pushed out, breasts filling and swelling. He grabbed his chest, squeezing the soft skin and flesh, trying to hold the skin down against his body. Steve moaned, the squeezing and rubbing triggering some kind of reaction as his breasts bulged fatter and fatter, easily passing C cups, straining his Polo and weighing heavily on his back.<br />
<br />
Another cramp struck him, making him nauseous. He reached down and found his cock inexplicably harder and yet strangely malleable, smaller. The tip was all wrong, it no longer had the flared head, instead it was rounded, smooth. He groaned as his testicles gave another pulse and his reached lower to find them. He found one but as soon as he touched it, it shrunk pulled into a wet, warm slit beneath the base of his balls. The entire area was sensitive and bulging on both sides with a smooth, unbroken line running down the middle. <br />
<br />
A new sensation began to pulse through the cramps. Something loosened deep in his hips and he felt muscles he’d never had before glide wetly together.  He pulled his skin and bent to see what was happening saw only a bulging, wet slit. His finger slid against the lips of his pussy and he accidentally dipped into his wetness. His tiny cock pulled into his body, the folds of his new vagina slipping over the shrinking tip, leaving him with a smooth, pink clit.<br />
<br />
The cramps faded, leaving only a building heat in his pussy. He removed his fingers, trailing sticky strands of fluid, and wiped them on his (her?) polo. The heat kept building, ceasing to be something she could afford to ignore. Her hand shook, torn between dealing with it or trying to smooth the Polo. Her pussy felt so hot and wet, images of a big, thick cock entering her kept flashing in her mind.<br />
<br />
She turned and ran into a hard, furry wall that smelled like a musky barnyard. Steve looked up, legs shaking, into the warm, lustful eyes of a rather handsome Minotaur. His thick, bovine cock bounced between her tits at full mast. She could smell him and her mouth watered.<br />
<br />
“You alright, honey?” His voice was soft and deep, with a country twang.<br />
<br />
Steve shook her (his?) head, luscious locks falling around her face. “I’m feeling weird.”<br />
<br />
“You’re in heat, sweetie pie.” The Minotaur reached out and gently stroked her face. She leaned into it, reluctantly. He reached up and rubbed two little horn nubs that poked through her hair. “Looks like you got a little Minotaur in your family tree.”<br />
<br />
“No, I-.” Steven blinked, feeling them herself, furry ears flicking, tiny tail writhing in agitation. “W-what?”<br />
<br />
“What’s your name sweet thang?”<br />
<br />
She gasped as he hooked a thick thumb into her wet snatch and pulled her up against his thickly muscled and furry torso.<br />
<br />
“S-steve-” Steve gasped as the minotaur rubbed his-her? clit between his fingers.<br />
<br />
“Stevie? What a cute name. My name is Leander” The Minotaur snuffled and licked his own nose. “You smell ripe, Stevie. Want me to put some calves in you?”<br />
<br />
“Calves?” Stevie asked. Then blinked. That wasn’t her name, right? Instead of being horrified, she felt butterflies in her stomach. This big bull wanted her?<br />
<br />
Leander mistook her reply for consent. She gasped as he lifted her up and gently lowered her onto his turgid cock, spreading her virgin pussy like a flower. She-no, he, tried to squirm off, but it only made the pleasure blooming in her blossom faster. She moaned, and Leander kissed her, jostling her lower onto that thick dick that was impaling her so nicely.<br />
<br />
Stevie tried to ignore the wonderful feeling of fullness, the sense of fulfillment, the easing of the heat in her loins. The Minotaur carried her, still impaled, into the house. He found himself losing to the sensation of slick muscle and veiny cock sliding against eachother. Then  Leander misstepped and landed heavily, jostling his medial ring against her clit and she experienced her first orgasm. The pleasure flushed any trace of Steve from her mind. <br />
<br />
The Minotaur took his prize to a guest room and shut the door. If anyone outside were listening, the squelch of cock in pussy and the giggles and moans would have indicated nothing out of the ordinary between the new lovers. Or rather, between the future parents of six little Minotaurs.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-==--=<br />
<br />
Sophia looked through the sea of people until she finally found who she was looking for: a twunkish-looking elf with long, red hair. The elf sat on the side of the pool next to a Minotaur, groping the bull man’s massive pecs. The young woman marched up to him and cleared her throat.<br />
<br />
“Mark, or ‘Ameav&#39;Vendil’, or whatever you go by,” she said. “I must ask a favor of you.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, can this wait until later lady?” Mark asked, groping his lover’s pecs more. “My boyfriend and I are in the middle of something.”<br />
<br />
“No, this can’t wait until later,” Sophia said, sounding annoyed. “I need you to change this poor hippogriff back to his original form. He was transformed into the creature you see before you when he climbed my tower and freed me.”<br />
<br />
Mark was about to respond when the Minotaur put a hand on his shoulder. He was looking at the hippogriff with a confused look on his face, but it wasn’t long until his eyes widened in realization.<br />
<br />
“Todd?!” the Minotaur shouted. “Todd is that you?!”<br />
<br />
Todd squawked and nodded his head, but eyed the Minotaur cautiously, looking confused. The Minotaur sighed in relief. “It’s me, Xarxos. Are you still you?” The hippogriff squawked, though Xarxos wasn’t sure what that meant.<br />
<br />
“Wait, you know this hippogriff, babe?” Mark asked, looking from his lover to the hippogriff in confusion.<br />
<br />
“Yes, he’s my employee,” Xarxos explained. “He was with me at the convention. He’s the one who got kidnapped, remember?”<br />
The hippogriff squawked again.<br />
<br />
“But if he got kidnapped, then how is he here?”<br />
<br />
“Turn him into something that can talk so he can tell us!”<br />
<br />
“Okay, uh…” Mark thought for a second before a grin crossed his face.<br />
<br />
He pointed at Todd, “Shift.”<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, the hippogriff’s body began to shift and reshape, losing its horse-like shape and returning to a much more human shape. Todd hunched over on the ground and let out a squawk of pain as the bones in his legs cracked and reshaped, his legs returning to their former digitigrade structure. His hooves split off into four digits, beginning to turn back into paws. As his feathers began to fall out, Todd felt relieved. He was ready to go back to being a wolf.<br />
<br />
Then, things got…weird…<br />
<br />
Instead of changing into paws, Todd’s feet grew slightly larger as his nails lengthened into sharp, black claws. The fur on his lower body began to rapidly fall out, being replaced by small splotches of blue. As Todd looked closer, he quickly realized what they were: scales.<br />
<br />
The cobalt blue scales began to spread rapidly, marching up his legs like a swarm of ants. Behind him, Todd’s former horse tail lost all its fur and began to thicken, changing into a very reptilian shape. The blue scales covered the top of the tail, while wide, gold colored scutes grew in on the underside. The scutes spread up his tail, covering the inside of his legs around his thighs before covering his stomach and chest before stopping just below his head. The blue scales spread around them, quickly covering every patch of bare skin that they came across.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Todd doubled over in pain, letting out a screech of pain from his still avian beak as a terrible burning sensation filled his insides as they twisted and reshaped themselves into new forms. The transforming male began retching in agony as the burning feeling rose higher and higher, going up his chest and into his throat. Then, when he thought he wouldn’t be able to last any longer, Todd let out a hacking cough, and a puff of fire came flying out. Thankfully, it landed in the pool and quickly fizzled out.<br />
<br />
The orange scales on his hands and arms quickly changed color to match the rest of the scales on his body. As the digit on his talon that used to be his thumb moved back into its former position, similar claws emerged from his heels and elbows.<br />
<br />
The transforming male felt an immense pressure in his skull. Reaching up, he felt as two thick, back-curving gold horns emerged from his head. His wings had lost all their feathers, becoming covered in blue scales as thick, gold membranes grew in and connected the bones of the wings together.<br />
<br />
His beak shifted into a muzzle as new, razor sharp teeth grew in his enlarging mouth. As the blue scales completely covered his face and head, sharp spurs began to develop along the length of his spine, staring at the base of his neck and going all the way down to the tip of his tail. A series of spiked scales grew on the sides of his face and the top of his head before the changes finally slowed to a halt. Where there had once been a normal hippogriff was a dragonborn covered in cobalt blue and gold scales.<br />
<br />
“How do you feel, oh mighty dragonborn Zinnarth?” Mark asked with a grin, watching as the dragon breathed heavily.<br />
<br />
The dragonborn slowly raised his head and looked at Mark. “I‘m…fine,” he said, his voice sounding smooth and masculine. “Though who the fuck is Zinnarth? My name is clearly Todd. And…is that you, Tex?”<br />
<br />
Mark’s eyes widened as the dragonborn stood up, wobbling slightly before approaching. How was this possible?! The reality shift should have changed his memories. Xarxos seemed equally as shocked.<br />
<br />
“Todd…how can you remember my old name? Reality has shifted at least twice since we last saw each other.” The Minotaur inquired.<br />
<br />
The dragonborn scratched the back of his head.<br />
<br />
“It’s a long story,” he said. “I got turned into a jackalope, kidnapped, had sex with Alexandros, and he used all of his power to enchant a buttplug that makes me immune to the effects of reality shifts. It also nullifies the effects of the contract that we were apparently tricked into ‘signing’ upon boarding the plane.”<br />
<br />
“…You have an enchanted buttplug in your ass?” Mark quirked an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Could we just not talk about it?” the dragonborn asked, clearly embarrassed. “I promise I’ll explain more later. Right now, I just want to sleep for a bit.”<br />
<br />
“Right, you’re probably exhausted after all the shit you’ve been through today,” Xarxos said. “The guest bedroom is upstairs and down the hall, third door on the right. If you want, we’ll talk to Trog, er…Troy in the morning about turning you back into a wolf.”<br />
<br />
The dragon gave a thumbs up before turning to face Sophia. The young woman smiled at the dragon.<br />
<br />
“So, your name is Todd,” she said. “Thank you for saving me. I am forever grateful.”<br />
<br />
“It’s no problem…” Todd said, scratching the back of his head. “Though I have to know: why were you locked in that tower to begin with?”<br />
<br />
Sophia broke eye contact with the dragonborn, much to his confusion.<br />
<br />
“I’ll tell you in due time,” she said. “Right now, go and get some rest. We can talk more in the morning.”<br />
<br />
“Okay…good night…” The dragonborn walked into the mansion, making his way past various mythical creatures and humans.<br />
<br />
Sophia turned her attention back to the Minotaur. “So who’s the guy passed out in the front yard?”<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Todd wasn’t entirely paying attention to where he was going. He was ready to pass out and go to sleep. He didn’t see the small figure running down the hall until they ran face first into him, falling to the ground with a small “Oof!” Todd quickly looked down and saw a red kobold sitting on the floor. They wore nothing but a brown loincloth to cover their genitalia.<br />
<br />
“Oh my gosh, I am so sorry!” Todd said, kneeling down to get closer to the kobold. “Are you okay?”<br />
<br />
The small reptile rubbed his ass slightly. When he looked up at Todd, his face lit up with excitement. “Sir is perfect!”<br />
<br />
The dragon wasn’t entirely sure how to react to the kobold’s sudden comment. “Uh…thank you?” He extended his hand out to the kobold, and the smaller reptile graciously took it.<br />
<br />
“Thank you sir! Rakko is glad he ran into you sir!” The kobold, who Todd presumed to be named Rakko, said. “Sir is exactly the kind of person Rakko has been looking for!”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?” Todd asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“Rakko has been looking for a very special person!” the kobold yapped. “Rakko’s brothers want to make a special movie, but brothers are needing a very special actor!”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know…I’ve had a really long day, and I honestly just want to go to sleep right now…”<br />
<br />
“Please sir! Help will not be long!”<br />
<br />
While Todd did feel rather tired, there was something about this little kobold that the dragonborn found oddly adorable. Surely it wouldn’t hurt to go and check out what Rakko and his brothers had planned, right?<br />
<br />
“Alright, I’ll come see what you and your brothers are doing,” Todd said, giving the little kobold a toothy grin. Rakko’s face lit up again, and he began to happily shake the dragonborn’s hand.<br />
<br />
“Thank you sir!” he yapped. “Thank you thank you thank you! Sir will not regret his decision! Rakko promises!” <br />
<br />
Still gripping Todd’s hand, the little reptile began to lead the dragon down the hall and up the stairs. He pulled the dragonborn into the first door on the left, yipping excitedly. As Todd entered the room, he stopped dead in his tracks upon seeing the room.<br />
<br />
The entire room was filled with sex swings, various shelves of sex toys, beds, a full camera, and lighting set up. It didn’t take long for Todd to realize what kind of movie that Rakko wanted to shoot. Standing in the room were two other kobolds, a green one and an orange one. Upon seeing their sibling return with a dragon, the two kobolds rushed over to see Todd, yapping happily.<br />
<br />
“Vogu can’t believe Rakko found a dragon!” the green kobold yapped. “Can Teppo believe it?”<br />
<br />
“Teppo can’t believe it either!” the orange kobold yapped. “A real dragon!”<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, I&#39;m not really a dragon, I&#39;m a Dragonborn.&quot; Todd held up his hands. &quot;Are you guys listening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The trio of kobolds continued to yap happily while Todd stood there, shocked and confused. He didn’t have much time to question anything, and Rakko and Vogu grabbed his hands and pulled him towards the bed. They forced him into a leather harness that had leathery wings attached to it.<br />
<br />
“Hang on, you never told me you were filming a porno!” Todd exclaimed. “I…I didn’t agree to be part of a porno!”<br />
<br />
“Sir does not need to be worried!” Rakko yapped.<br />
<br />
“Sir will have a good time!” Vogu added. “All sir needs to do is let kobolds do their job!”<br />
<br />
“And…what exactly is that?” The dragonborn asked as he was pushed onto the bed by the smaller reptiles. &quot;Hey! Is it even okay to be in here? Do you have permission to use this stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
The three kobolds looked at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally!&quot; Rakko nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, of course!&quot; Vogue snorted, then whispered something to Teppo.<br />
<br />
Teppo quickly ran to the door and locked it, pushing a chiar under the door handle, before running behind the camera and turning it on and pressing the record button. When the camera started recording, the orange kobold ran to the bed with his brothers.<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t sir know?” Rakko asked. “Kobolds exist to serve dragons! We wish to worship and please you!” The trio of kobolds all dropped their loincloths, revealing their erect cocks. They all climbed onto the bed with Todd and slowly crawled towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m not-&quot; Todd protested.<br />
<br />
“Sir should just relax and let kobolds do the work,” Teppo said. <br />
<br />
The orange kobold leaned in and began to gently kiss and lick Todd’s chest, making the dragon gasp. Vogu then joined his brother, doing the same on the other side of Todd’s chest. Then, he felt Rakko move close to his crotch. The red kobold gently ran his hand along the scales before finding what he was looking for: the small slit that housed the dragonborn’s cock. He brought his muzzle in close and began to lick, eliciting a moan from the supposed dragon. Rakko stuck his tongue deep into the slit, licking and slurping in an attempt to entice Todd’s reptilian member out of its hiding place. His attempts weren’t in vain, as the dragonborn’s pointed red cock began to emerge.<br />
<br />
“Sir seems to be enjoying our work!” Vogu yipped, sliding down to get closer to Todd’s cock. “May we taste it sir?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…go for it…” Todd panted. “All three of you.”<br />
<br />
“Yes sir!” the trio yipped in unison. The three of them moved down around Todd’s cock, making enough room for each other. The small reptiles leaned in and began to shower the dragonborn’s cock in kisses and licks, causing Todd to throw his head back and moan in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
“F-Fuck! If you keep going like that…I-I’m gonna…”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Rakko stopped licking Todd’s cock. Before the dragonborn could ask what was happening, the red kobold sat on his cock, shoving it deep inside him. The little reptile moaned out in pleasure as he bounced up and down on Todd&#39;s slick dick. Feeling a bit bad for Vogu and Teppo, Todd pulled the other two kobolds close to him and passionately made out with the two of them, listening to their soft whines and moans of pleasure. He could feel his orgasm getting closer and closer. Unable to hold it back any longer, the dragonborn cried out in pleasure as he came inside the red kobold’s ass, earning yaps of pleasure as Rakko came all over himself and Todd.<br />
<br />
The faux-dragon panted as Rakko slid off his cock, his ass dripping with potent draconic seed. The kobold whimpered happily and curled up next to Todd. Seeing the pleased reaction of their brother, Vogu and Teppo prepared for their turn. Todd was about to tell them that he probably wasn’t going to cum again for a while until he realized something: he definitely could cum again.<br />
<br />
Maybe the sex drive of a dragonborn was higher than that of a human or wolf, but Todd was almost instantly ready to go for round two. The other two kobolds seemed to know this, as Vogu lowered himself onto the fake dragon’s cock, moaning as he did so. As Todd kissed Rakko, he reached down and grasped Teppo’s throbbing cock in his hand, jacking it off as he did so. The orange kobold moaned in pleasure, bucking his hips slightly as the dragonborn gave him the best handjob of his life.<br />
<br />
Before long, Todd shot his seed deep into Vogu’s ass, making the green kobold scream out in bliss as he reached his own orgasm. He slipped off Todd’s shaft, and Teppo didn’t waste a second taking his place. The orange kobold happily bounced up and down on Todd’s fuckstick, moaning out in sheer happiness and bliss. The dragon bucked his hips a few times, smirking as the kobold gasped in pleasure each time. He wasn’t entirely sure how they did it, but this trio of kobolds really knew how to milk him dry!<br />
<br />
Unable to hold back any longer, Todd came for the third time that night, flooding Teppo’s ass. The orange kobold came as well, showering the four of them in his seed. When both of their orgasms died down, Teppo pulled himself off Todd’s cock and collapsed on the dragonborn’s chest, breathing heavily.<br />
<br />
“Sir…sir did fantastic…” Teppo moaned, kissing Todd’s chest.<br />
<br />
“Sir was even better than Vogu imagined!” Vogu added, kissing the faux-dragon’s arms.<br />
<br />
“Serving sir was the best experience of Rakko’s life!” Rakko said, kissing Todd.<br />
<br />
The dragonborn laughed. “You three were just as good as I was, so don’t give me all the credit!” he said, praising the kobolds. “Maybe we should make another movie in the future?”<br />
<br />
Rakko’s eyes lit up, and the other two kobolds nodded happily.<br />
<br />
“What’s sirs name?” Rakko asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s, um,” Todd glanced at the camera. “It’s Zinnarth!”</p>
