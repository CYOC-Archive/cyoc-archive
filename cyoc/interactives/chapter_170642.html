<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I couldn’t believe my eyes. I had seen enough shows and played many RPG games to know what that screen had meant. <br />
<br />
“Is this truly what I think it is?” <br />
<br />
I asked myself as I looked into my hands. Then, deciding there was no point whatsoever on holding back, I thought on dismissing the message. As I did, the notification disappeared. I couldn’t help but smile at the thought of what I could achieve. Then, hoping to explore my new powers, I said the word “status” aloud but nothing happened. I tried several times until I found the trick for the window to open. I couldn’t just think or say the word, I had to think of being able to see the numbers in order to know. As the window opened, I went straight to the facts.<br />
<br />
Player: Hunter Atwood.<br />
Age: 16<br />
Class: Commoner – 1<br />
HP: 30/30<br />
MP: 50/50<br />
STR: 2<br />
DEX: 4<br />
INT: 6<br />
CHA: 1<br />
Skills known: Identify lvl 1<br />
<br />
I couldn’t help but fall back into my pillow trying to avoid seeing the window again. My stats sucked. My best one was Intelligence and my worst was Charisma. The problem, however, is that most of my stats in general were so low. The only upside was that I did know a skill. Identify. Based on pure instinct I could tell that the skill should work in a similar way as how I was able to bring upon the status window. Thus, I used identify on my phone.<br />
<br />
||Technological device used to communicate with other people in various ways||<br />
<br />
The description was simple, but accurate. Despite the fact that my stats were trash, I couldn’t help but spend the rest of the night using the skill. By the time morning came around, the identify skill had leveled up to level 2 already. Once I leveled the skill, I sort of realized that the descriptions were meant to improve and give additional information as it got better.<br />
<br />
Once it was time for breakfast, I was feeling tired and with hints of a headache already. I reasoned it was probably because after using the skill so much I was left with no mana at all. Fortunately, every 5 minutes it kept increasing by 1 point. By the time I reached the breakfast table, my massive brothers were already eating. Adam had his girlfriend on his lap, she was the stereotypical queen bee who couldn’t keep her eyes from her cellphone. He, on the other hand, was busy playing with one of her boobs as he used the other hand to hold the fork. He was wearing only a couple of flip-flops and basketball shorts. I knew he was going commando, as he always did right after morning sex. I could see the outline of his huge rod, though I never had the opportunity to actually see it erect.<br />
<br />
My little brother was following his example of course, followed the same fashion choices though I could tell he was using boxers, probably still too naïve to know Adam hardly ever wears when he’s at home. My dad, on the other hand, was already fully dressed into his coach outfit. He was wearing a tight polo on his massive frame, you could clearly see the outline of his manly big hairy pecs, and his biceps looked like they would rip the sleeves any time now. He was also wearing a pair of short shorts. I loved to see his thick hairy long legs and the way his shorts hugged his big butt. <br />
<br />
“Morning” I said like nothing had happened over night. My brothers replied with a nod as they kept eating. My dad, however, turned to me and with one hand he shoved my face against his crotch. His huge cock was outlined through his clothes and even though I knew he had taken a shower, his crotch smelled like sex and had my dad’s incredibly masculine musk.<br />
<br />
“Morning champ! Go have a seat, I’ll serve you right up”<br />
<br />
Fuck, I loved my daddy so much. That was his way of giving me a hug, always a shove to his crotch. Of course I didn’t hesitate for long and went to my especially designed seat. The table was made to have long legs because everyone was so big, so I needed to have a especial seat for myself that had a sort of ladder in it. It made me feel like a baby, but I was already used to it. <br />
<br />
While the guys were eating, I realized I had 3 points of mana now and that I could use Identify again, so I decided to use it on them. I decided to start with my dad and then my brothers.<br />
<br />
||Steve Atwood – Non player commoner level 5. Very tall man that loves his family very much. He is regretful for not being the strongest man on earth yet and the possibility he will never be.||<br />
<br />
||Adam Atwood – Non player commoner level 4. Very tall young man with libido as high as his father. Sometimes wishes he could just spend his life having sex.||<br />
<br />
||Lance Atwood – Non player commoner level 3. Very tall young man that wants to be like his big brother. Hopes to never stop growing.||<br />
<br />
At first, I was expecting for the skill to tell me some stats like how big their cocks are, wasn’t expecting to know Adam and little Lance had such kinky secrets, and even how dad just wanted to be basically a beast. I felt like I could comment on it a little, but the truth was that I was already out of it. Now I truly had a headache and needed to lay down. Today was Saturday, so after the men had breakfast, they all headed out for basketball practice. I, on the other hand, was supposed to stay home to do the dishes and some other chores. I always liked Saturdays because I could go to my brother’s and my dad’s rooms and dig into their clothes and footwear. However, today was not that kind of day. I immediately went to my room to take a nap, as the headache for running out of mana was killing me. I couldn’t tell anything to my dad as I knew he would have stayed had I said anything, then my brothers would have been mad. They are very understanding except when it comes to their basketball or their sex. <br />
<br />
As I went to take a nap while hugging my dad’s crotch pillow, the one he puts right under his big cock when he has no one to sleep with, I couldn’t help but wish we had more family time together. Then, just as I was about fall unconscious, a screen popped up in my mind.<br />
