<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Knock - knock, hey in there, I changed my mind, can I come in?&quot; It was Mike who was there and jeff hearing his friend, had a renewed hope of finding a way to stop what was happening to his body.<br />
<br />
With some difficulty of coordinating his changing hands to unlock and then turn the door nob to open the front door, Jeff stepped a stride step back as then Mike did the rest, he opening the door to see what was his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I changed... duh Jeff? Jeff what is happening? You look somewhat like Jeff, who or what are you... hey Jeff, Jeff, come help, this thing is in your living room!&quot; Mike yelled, he facing there a naked half man half goat creature. &quot;JEFF, JEFF..., so whatever you are, you keep away from me!&quot; Mike said, as a bewildered and changing Jeff held up his hand facing his friend and gave the Star Trek Vulcan style greeting the two friends used so often when in high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff...?&quot; Mike said, he suddenly realizing the thing standing there was his best friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;How, how did this happen, your changing, you look like more a goat than a person, how?&quot; Mike asked, as Jeff turned around, he wishing to give a reply but due to his mouth having become likened to a goat muzzle, words were wanting. He strode on goat legs, feet, and cloven hooves toward his bedroom, with plans to hold up the vial that caused his deformities.<br />
<br />
Mike followed his changing friend, he going to the bedroom and entering there, saw lying on the opened bed the vial Jeff had taken, stole from the downtown ointment shop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Poison stuff, or you used it in an inappropriate way as it caused you to begin changing, am I right?&quot; Mike asked, as Jeff using his only clear method to reply, he stood there nodding his head as if to specify a yes answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you call the shop and talk to the proprietor there,&quot; Mike asked, seeing then Jeff do another head nod.   <br />
&quot;Did you ask for an antidote?&quot; Mike asked of Jeff, to which Jeff shook his head side to side.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no you did not ask for the antidote?&quot; Mike asked of Jeff, to which Jeff shook his head to signify a No answer. &quot;Do you like what you are, as are becoming physically like being a goat?&quot; Mike asked of Jeff, to which Jeff shook his head again, as to signify his answering as No!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you spoke to the proprietor, but did not ask for an antidote, or could not by then speak to ask? You were by then changing into becoming a male goat, but do not like what you are and as such, are feeling..., so what then?&quot;Mike asked of his friend in trouble.<br />
<br />
Jeff standing there moved his right hand to feeling of, as messaging his very goat like sheath. He began coaxing from his furry sheath his very pink colored as uncircumcised, deformed and pointy goat cock. As Jeff began then stroking and masturbating his sensuous new cock, Jeff stood there looking, he gawking, was licking his lips with anxious desire of want for to suckle on his friend.<br />
<br />
Mike had not long to wait, as with a pelvis shudder of Jeff his cock erupted, shooting forth three blasted streams of goat semen. The blasts of semen flew the distance between the two friends, as splattered across the chin, mouth, and left cheek on Mike his face.<br />
<br />
Stunned by the spewed blasts of semen shot at him, Mike stood for a long moment before he opened his mouth and with his tongue gave a licking up of the semen coating around his lips  and mouth.<br />
<br />
Jeff then stepped forward as stood then closer to his friend, Jeff still sporting his stiff erect cock pointed at Mike. Jeff reached his furry right arm to set his fuzzy hand on the shoulder of his friend, as if to beckon Mike to wish as want for more sexual fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that was some jacking off, is that what you find as your greater new delight from becoming like a goat? No, no, I will lay you a bet your becoming likened to a goat because you stole the vial, did then the Proprietor call you, and he curse you?&quot; Mike asked of Jeff, to which Jeff gave an affirming head nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;He cursed you to become... a goat, a buck goat, not a satyr, but as a goat!<br />
<br />
You being from what I see you are, becoming more like a goat than being your human form self. So what then, the vial is almost empty, you having used it!<br />
<br />
I think then you are liking the feelings of becoming soon as is a male goat, a buck goat, and then a herd sire..., oh no!<br />
<br />
Your semen, it is goat semen, you being cursed, your semen is infectious... am I correct in that assumption?&quot; Mike asked of Jeff. To that question Jeff nodded his changing head, affirming that to what he knew, his semen was infectious, and by Mike having licked of it, as swallowed some, He, Mike would be joining Jeff as being another buck goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh how could you be so disloyal, Jeff, Jeff, is it you would wish for me to join you or that by becoming more like a animal, a goat you are acting by instincts?&#39; Mike asked of Jeff, as Jeff then reached his fuzzy hands to grasp Mike by the back of his head and pushing him down to kneeling before Jeff, aimed his erect goat cock at, as pointing the tip to press at the lips of Mike&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Jeff, no aw..., ack, cough, ga...ga,&quot; Mike struggling to say as beg his friend not to do what he knew he was doing, as from the sensation of his cock entering a warm, wet mouth, Jeff ejaculated a second orgasm load of his highly infectious semen.</p>
