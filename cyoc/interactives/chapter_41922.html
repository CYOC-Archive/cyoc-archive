<br />
1. Kari - Fuzzy armed,  stealth bonus against Earth King's followers, captured by Earth King's enemies, fish tail<br />
2. Richie - Ten years old, hawk eyes, naga (current turn)<br />
3. Angel - Hawk eyes, has potion of speed, in heat (lose next turn)<br />
4. Darwin - Naga<br />
5. Ester - Vixen, Forest Guardian (trapped in forest), forest camo, in heat (lose next turn)<br />
6. Micha - Desert Sultan's eight year old daughter (trapped in desert, movement cut in half), becomes a half human half scorpion creature every other turn<br />
<br />
Richie rolled the dice and they came up a two and a four. Not enough to get to Kari but looking at what he could get he was relieved to see that it was an item card. He moved to the space and took the card that came out. After reading it he let out a low moan and said &quot;I can't believe this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Darwin asked.<br />
<br />
Richie moaned again and said &quot;The card says 'You find a bottle with what appears to be water in it. Being thirsty you drink it. It was a potion and it turned you into a Plains Spirit. You are unable to leave the plains unless someone willingly allows you to cohabitate in their body.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; Kari said. &quot;You're trapped on the plains now! That makes four that are trapped or captured!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Richie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How will we play now?&quot; Darwin asked worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know but it looks like Richie is changing&quot; Kari said.<br />
<br />
Richie was transforming but in a way no one thought of. He was becoming semi-transparent. The clothes he had on fell right through his body leaving him completely naked. He might have been blushing at this but it was hard to tell. A new card slid out of Richie's side of the board. He tried to grab it and to his surprise he was able to hold it.<br />
<br />
Kari looked at Richie's face and asked &quot;What does it say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Richie took a deep breath and said &quot;It says 'Three of your party are now trapped and one is captured. Each player will now be transported to their areas. Each player will be transported back when it's their turn. Pausing the game will transport all players back to the game board.' Well that's good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how we'll be transported&quot; Darwin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we're about to find out&quot; Kari said as a white light surrounded each of them. The sensation was the same for each of them. It felt like someone had punched in the gut and grabbed their insides the jerk them forward. Each felt a heavy thud as they were dumped in the places where their pawns were.<br />
<br />
Kari found herself on some type of stretcher surrounded by about twelve men. She could tell that she was still in the plains but she couldn't see anyone else around. She looked down and saw that she wasn't wearing any clothes at all. One of the men came over and poured some water over her. It wasn't enough to fully relieve the tightness of her skin but it did provide some relief.<br />
<br />
Richie stood on the plains wondering how this happened. He looked down at the bottle that had contained the potion that trapped him here.<br />
<br />
Angel landed in the forest within sight of Ester. She couldn't hold out much longer and quickly tore off her clothes. She laid down on the forest floor and started fingering herself hoping that some male would come along and help her find some satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Darwin found himself on the plains with no clothes on. He  looked around but couldn't see anyone. He decided to try and find the others. Unfortunately he didn't get far before he hit what felt like a wall. &quot;Damn!&quot; he cursed at himself. &quot;I should have known that I wouldn't be able to move far. I guess I'm stuck here until my turn. Since Angel's turn is being skipped this round I should be transported back at any moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ester landed in the forest and her clothes were gone. She saw Angel fingering herself and started to finger herself as well. She knew that both of them were going to be too busy to roll the dice. She wondered how she had physically ended up in the forest. She was glad that she was though as she could think clearly again.<br />
<br />
Micha found himself/herself in the Desert Sultan's oasis palace. He/she didn't know how he/she knew that but he/she did. He/she looked down at himself/herself and found that he/she was wearing different clothes. He/she was wearing a tan silk dress, silk underwear, and silk lined sandals that were probably made with very expensive leather. He/she looked around and noticed that there were two guards with wicked looking scimitars standing a few paces behind him/her. He/she guessed that they were his/her bodyguards. This didn't give Micha any confidence at all.<br />
<br />
Darwin saw the light and felt the tug again. When he landed he was back in the apartment with the game board. There was another card sticking out and he picked it up reading aloud &quot;Each player that is in the world will be able to hear the one who's at the board speaking.&quot; He looked at the pawns and said &quot;Well that makes things a little easier. We should try to get into a group again. How do we do that though when three of us are trapped in different areas? I guess we should try to rescue Kari and maybe see if we can free Micha too. I could probably let Richie cohabitate with me. He doesn't seem to be that far from me.&quot; Suddenly Kari's pawn moved a five spaces to the south-west. If Kari kept going in that direction she would be in the desert and maybe the oasis that Micha found.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I know who the Earth King's enemy is&quot; Darwin said. &quot;I think it might be the Desert Sultan. The desert will be torture for Kari if she's taken there. I'm going to roll now and hope that something good happens.&quot; He picks up the dice and takes a deep breath. He briefly wondered if the pheromones had worn off of Angel since her turn was skipped. &quot;Well, here goes nothing&quot; he said as he rolled the dice.</p>
