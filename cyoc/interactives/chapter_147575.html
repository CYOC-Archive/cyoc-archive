<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After another minute or so of being completely dumbfounded with what happened, the family managed to calm down enough to listen better. Janet got everyone to sit at the table and changed Alan back to normal. Steve agreed to change back but Megan refused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please honey?&quot; Janet asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Mom, I was ugly and gross.&quot; She huffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey you were fine the way you were.&quot; Steve chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really Dad? Then why&#39;d you change yourself?&quot; She snipped back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well honey, when you get older it gets harder to move, you get larger, and you miss the old days. I just want to feel young and spirited once and a while.&quot; He explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I want to feel pretty, always.&quot; She growled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay. Fine. You can stay that way for now but we have to have a talk about your self esteem young lady.&quot; Janet ordered. Megan rolled their eyes and Alan just looked away trying to mind his own business.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Janet continued &quot;We all have magic now. I know that&#39;s a lot to take in right now but we have to be responsible. We need to take this completely seriously. We have the power to change reality itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh like changing your son into a dog?&quot; Alan sassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually yes honey. Again, I&#39;m sorry that happened but it&#39;s a good example of how not to use your power. I should have controlled myself better, and since I didn&#39;t someone suffered.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but only we are aware of any of this.&quot; Megan retorted. &quot;Like, no-one will suffer if they don&#39;t know they changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still honey, even if they technically don&#39;t you still become responsible for that person&#39;s new life. If their new life is bad, it becomes your fault and your moral obligation to fix it.&quot; Steve explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Janet agreed. &quot;That&#39;s why we&#39;re going to have limits on the amount of magical interference we can do per day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Alan and Megan yelled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Mom!&quot; Alan yelled. &quot;Yeah that is so unfair.&quot; Megan agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry, do you two have any complaints? Because if you do I&#39;m sure spending a week as a baby would change you minds? Or maybe a week at doggy daycare?&quot; Janet threatened.<br />
<br />
Megan and Alan immediately shut up as Steve continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, judging by those reactions, I assume you two have had some ideas?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on Dad of course I do!&quot; Alan explained. &quot;I could punish bullies by making them shit themselves or date any girl or, you know, I could let us win the freaking lottery?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now we don&#39;t have any problems with those, especially not the last one, but we still need to be careful.&quot; Janet said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too much power corrupts son.&quot; Steve agreed.<br />
<br />
Megan and Alan just huffed as they sulked in their seats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, your mother and I have to talk about this. No more magic tonight alright? Your mother and I will decide how much magic you can use per day alright? Now up to bed it&#39;s a school night.&quot; Steve commanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Megan began before Steve gave her a &quot;Now Megan&quot; look.<br />
<br />
Alan and Megan sadly walked upstairs and once they were out of earshot both parents sighed in relief. <br />
&quot;Thanks for backing me up honey.&quot; Janet gleefully said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem honey. I&#39;m just worried about those two. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be fine as they are good kids, but I&#39;m worried about them with this much power.&quot; Steve explained.<br />
<br />
As the two parents talked, upstairs, Alan and Megan were having a reverse discussion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe Mom and Dad wanted me to change back.&quot; Megan whined. &quot;I mean, old me sucked.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on you didn&#39;t suck. You were a middle schooler with acne, so like, every middle schooler.&quot; Alan half joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah whatever.&quot; Megan sighed as she sat on Alan&#39;s desk chair. Alan just kept staring at his book and the one thing he had written. Suddenly, his phone buzzed, and as Alan read the text, his face lit up with glee. He hopped out of bed and started to open the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, what are you doing?&quot; Megan asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh, I&#39;m going on my date.&quot; Alan laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;But they said no magic tonight!&quot; Megan yelled. &quot;You&#39;ll just get yourself in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... Dad said no MORE magic tonight. I wrote this before the rule was in place.&quot; He slyly explained. &quot;Besides, Mom turned me into a dog so they owe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan just stared annoyed as Alan climbed out the window. She watched as she hopped in Melissa&#39;s car and drove away. Melissa was one of the hottest girls in the high school, so it made sense to Megan that Alan needed to change reality to get with her. She sighed as she got up and walked into her room.<br />
<br />
She walked in and was suddenly stunned with how it changed. It was completely different. Where her boyband and slightly geeky posters had stood, there were now cheer posters and manly models. The room was a lot more pink and there were a lot more fashionable clothes. The biggest change, however, was her desk photos. <br />
<br />
The only one there that hadn&#39;t changed was her family portrait. The rest of them, however, had totally changed. Some were at the beach, some were at cheer practice, some of them at school, but in all of them she was a cute popular version of herself. The only thing that bothered her, however, was that the people she was with in each of them were the popular girls.<br />
<br />
Previously, each of these girls had made fun of her in the past, but now, they were apparently &quot;friends&quot; of Megan. Megan started to panic as she pulled out her phone and searched her contacts for her real friends. Unfortunately, she had none of them. She had essentially erased her friendship with them with one motion.<br />
<br />
She realized what her parents had meant as she broke down on the floor and started to cry. The crying attracted her parents who ran in to comfort her.<br />
&quot;Baby what&#39;s wrong?&quot; He mother comforted her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Her father asked worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I-I&#39;m okay, it&#39;s just... look.&quot; She said pointing at her photos.<br />
<br />
Steve just stared confused but Janet caught on immediately.<br />
&quot;Changing your life had more consequences than you thought huh?&quot; Janet calmly asked.<br />
<br />
Megan just shook her head sadly as Janet brought her in for a hug.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay baby. Look your father and I haven&#39;t decided on how much magic we can all use, but use your mirror to change back to normal okay?&quot; She calmly answered.<br />
<br />
Megan sadly agreed and picked up her mirror. A shimmering glow emitted from it and suddenly the room was back to normal. Megan didn&#39;t like herself too much, but if her friends liked her, then she couldn&#39;t be that bad right?<br />
&quot;Thanks Mom.&quot; She said as she gave her mother another hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, sorry to interrupt, but where&#39;s Alan?&quot; Steve asked. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Alan was living the life. He was sitting in Mellissa Brown&#39;s car while going to a movie with her! She was a beautiful red head with big luscious curls and massive tits. Alan was in love with her the second he saw her years ago, but even though he was fairly popular, he never had the courage to ask her out. Now, he didn&#39;t even have to!<br />
<br />
&quot;.. and then she said no, but that&#39;s a real nice ski mask!&quot; Alan joked.<br />
<br />
Mellissa laughed with her beautiful smile and turned to look at him at a red light.<br />
&quot;God Alan, you&#39;re so funny. I can&#39;t believe you haven&#39;t asked me out before now.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you know, I&#39;ve just been waiting for the right time.&quot; He said slyly.<br />
<br />
The two smiled and the light turned green. Alan just started thinking about how great this was already going. He couldn&#39;t wait till after th movie. He was lost in thought until the scenery started to shimmer. He was confused as the car seemed to disappear and a bright white background appeared in front of him.<br />
<br />
He turned to ask Mellissa if she saw that but they were no longer in a car. In fact, they were at a house! It had bright white walls, a nice blue couch, a sick flat screen, just a normal suburban house. Mellissa was now across the room fiddling with something on the table. Alan was about to ask if she was okay when he realized his view was shrinking.<br />
<br />
In less than a minute, he found himself starring at below Mellissa&#39;s knees. He looked at his hands and saw they were pudgy and his fingers were shorter. His clothes began to morph as his whole body got pudgier and his height kept shrinking. His shirt became a pink softer t-shirt who his pants turned into a fluffy, disposable diaper!<br />
<br />
He realized what  must have happened as he tried to yell out but all that came out was baby babble as his teeth vanished upwards. He felt his blond hair thin out and then grow to his ears as he felt his pride and joy suck up into his body. Mellissa turned back around and walked over with a bottle she had been preparing, and upon seeing the Alan, her face lit up.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Oh... Alana I can&#39;t get over it you are so cute!&quot; She squealed in the tone women used to speak to babies. <br />
<br />
Alan tried to say something, anything, but nothing came out but nonsense. His emotions were suddenly less developed as a baby, so despite his mind being intact, he couldn&#39;t help but start to cry.<br />
&quot;Oh! No baby it&#39;s okay. Your mommy and daddy will be here soon to pick you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as she said that, there was a knock at the door. Mellissa walked over with &quot;Alana&quot; in hand and opened it to find Steve and Janet.<br />
&quot;Hi Mr. and Mrs. Donaldson. I&#39;m sorry I swear Alana was so well behaved but a minute ago she just started crying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no worries Mrs. Brown, we&#39;ve let you babysit before we know you&#39;re great.&quot; Steve replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you! I tried to give her her bottle but...&quot; She continued before Janet interrupted as she picked up Alan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Mellissa. I bet she just wants the real thing.&quot; Janet half joked as she pressed Alan against her breasts.<br />
<br />
By this point, Alan was beat red and beyond embarrassed. Even if Mellissa didn&#39;t;t remember this, he felt humiliated. Steve paid Mellissa for her babysitting and Janet fastened Alan into a baby seat. Alan turned to see Megan sitting next to him mouthing the words &quot;sorry&quot; before his parents hopped back into the car. Alan started to cry again but suddenly found his mouth plugged with a pacifier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice try pal.&quot; Steve joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve dealt with Megan as a baby and you a long time ago, we know how to handle babies.&quot; Janet laughed. &quot;Now don&#39;t blame your sister but we found out that you left. And no it wasn&#39;t the magic part that made us mad, it was the sneaking out part.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan sat there frustrated as the family drove home. Once they got back, Janet brought Alan upstairs and into his room, which had now transformed into a pink nursery. Janet happily changed his diaper, much to Alans embarrassment, and then tucked him into his crib.<br />
&quot;Goodnight ALANA, my sweet baby girl.&quot; Janet jokingly emphasized as Alan sat there.<br />
<br />
As much as he wanted to talk, he had mostly gotten over his frustration. Surprisingly, being unable to tap let him think and now he actually felt bad that he snuck out. He couldn&#39;t think for long, however, as his new baby body betrayed him. Alan drifted off to sleep in less than a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, at least with Alan as a baby again you got even greater breasts.&quot; Steve joked as the two got into bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, ha.&quot; Janet fake laughed. &quot;Let me tell you you gotta be careful before you wake up with a pair.&quot; She joked. &quot;God I forgot how much these things strained your back.&quot; She groaned.<br />
<br />
The two kissed as they drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
What next.</p>
