<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">•	Recap:<br />
•	Jeff bought a Chronivac and showed it to his sister, who took control and gave Jeff breasts<br />
•	The boobs are seen as normal, for Jeff, but he receives unexpected attention anyway<br />
•	The sister, Jane, gave the boobs an irresistible, supernatural beauty<br />
•	Jane has set the Chronivac to prevent Jeff from making changes that would remove his boobs<br />
<br />
“Well Jane if you won’t let me undo this maybe you can help another way.”<br />
“What is that supposed to mean?” she replied<br />
“I haven’t quite decided yet but I’ll think of something” he said hoping it would sound ominous enough that she’d just give in, but no such luck.  Jeff then took the Chronivac to his room and closed the door, locking it after him.  Jane knocked on the door threatening him in a low voice so as to not attract their mother’s attention.  Eventually she stopped and thought that since he hadn’t done anything yet he was just trying to scare her.  She went to her own room and decided to read to relax.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in Jeff’s room he was trying to do anything with the Chronivac that would change him back.  He tried to change the commands that Jane had assigned to him that prevented him from removing his breasts but couldn’t.  When he opened his stats, he simply couldn’t make his fingers move.  He spent an hour trying but any alteration to himself that would have allowed him to undo his boobs, or alter them, he simply could not type.  Then he tried another tactic.  He decided to alter Jane so that she would want to remove the boobs she’d given him.  Again, he just couldn’t.  It seems that Jane changed him so that he couldn’t do anything, directly or indirectly, that would lead to him getting rid of these breasts.  <br />
<br />
His next plan of attack was to buy another Chronivac to, hopefully, override the first.  However, he could find no reference to such a device anywhere on the internet.  The receipt the vendor had emailed him had also disappeared.  The box the device came in should have an address or phone number but it too seemed to have vanished.  He was now a little worried, if anything happened to this device before putting himself back to normal, he would be stuck.  So, temporarily defeated, and nearly time for dinner he went downstairs to see what there was to eat.<br />
<br />
Jeff came into the kitchen and asked what was for dinner.  His mom, Ellen, replied she was putting the leftovers together to make shepherd’s pie and that it would be done in about 15 minutes.  About the only way to get the kids to eat leftovers was to make it look like it was something new.  Ellen then asked him to wash his hands, set the table and then call Jane down for dinner.  The timing worked out and everything was ready at just about the same time.<br />
<br />
It was a quiet meal.  Jeff and Jane weren’t speaking and Jeff continued to try and come up with a scheme to break the lock.  Jane was becoming less worried about what Jeff might do to her but she knew he wasn’t evil so it wouldn’t be anything bad; if he did anything at all.  Ellen was lost in her own thoughts.  She had seen something interesting lately but couldn’t remember.  Couldn’t get her hands around it.  That made her chuckle silently and she didn’t even know why.  What that something, actually somethings-plural, was, were Jeff’s breasts.  Ellen had only briefly glimpsed her son’s bare breasts but they had left an impression on her subconscious.  Then it came to her, boobs, Jeff’s boobs.  Or breasts she should say breasts, she shouldn’t use a word like boobs when talking about her son.  That was a sexy word to her and her son’s boobs um breasts, shouldn’t be thought of as sexy.  Feeling relieved she had figured out what was in the back of her mind, she said.  “So, Jeff, you need new bras.  Do you want to go shopping tomorrow?”  Jeff didn’t know what to say, he didn’t know how long he was going to continue to need bras.  “Well Jane...” Jeff said “what do you think?”  Jane without missing a beat called his bluff and replied.  “Of course, why wouldn’t you?  You’ve just got the borrowed one, right?”  Jeff opened his mouth about to reply and then it came to him and he pivoted back to mom.  “You know what mom, I think I can make it one more day, so not tomorrow, maybe the day after.”  Ellen said “OK” and felt just the tiniest bit disappointed.  Jeff had such nice boobs he should have nice bras, to show them off.<br />
<br />
“Mom?  When is dad due back from his work thing?”  Jane asked.  Ellen, her mind elsewhere, said “What, oh Dad.  It hasn’t changed he’ll be back a week from tomorrow but when he gets back, he’s probably going to just rest up for the whole day.”  “Well then, since he is going to be resting can I spend that night over at Kim’s?”  Her mom said “That should be OK, but did you already clear it with Kim’s parents?”  Jane replied “Not yet but I will ask tomorrow and not spring it on them at the last minute, is that OK?”  “Works for me, as long as you get and answer back tomorrow or the next day.”  Ellen said.  After that, dinner was quiet, and they finished their meal, cleaned up the dishes and each went off to do their own thing.<br />
<br />
During dinner Jeff came up with an idea to punish Jane and maybe scare her into helping.  He typed into the Chonivac all of the settings so it was ready-to-go.  He would just have to press enter and “Y” to confirm it would be done; done so quickly that Jane couldn’t interfere.  Once ready he asked Jane to come into his room and sit on the bed.  Jeff sat in his one chair, next to the desk, next to the waiting Chronivac.  Jeff immediately got off on the wrong foot by being dictatorial.  “Alright Jane, here is what you’re going to do… I have had these boobs long enough and you ARE going to remove them from me right now, while I look over your shoulder to ensure you don’t do something else stupid.”<br />
<br />
Jane had come in expecting to be reasonable and, had he asked nicely, she would have returned him to normal; after all she’d had her fun.  Even with his attitude she would have been kind enough to fix Jeff, if it hadn’t been for the special properties that she’d given Jeff’s boobs.  Even though not nearly as affected as Alex and her posse had been at seeing Jeff’s naked boobs, Jane was still feeling a slight influence, making her a bit resistant to see those wonderful orbs taken out of her life.  So, between his demeanor and her, as yet, unrecognized fondness for Jeff’s boobs, she was not going to give in.  “No.  Try asking nicely next time Dolly Parton.” She said and started to get up.<br />
<br />
Jeff just nodded and pressed Enter then “Y” on his keyboard, and just like that, Jane was gone from Jeff’s bed.  That wasn’t entirely true.  There was a bra on Jeff’s bed which just moments before had been Jane.  Jeff stood up and came over to stand in front of the bra and said “Since you wouldn’t support me in getting rid of these boobs you are going to support me in keeping them.  You are now a very-very comfortable bra.  You will be excellent for sleeping in or wearing during the day.”  This was almost becoming like a villain’s monologue from some spy film.  Jeff continued “Since you can hear me you know that you’re not just some pieces of fabric sewn together.  While you cannot speak or move you can still think, and you have your other senses, sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste.  Hopefully I don’t get too stinky or sweaty for you.  Oh, and while you can feel, you cannot feel pain.  I wasn’t sure how being pulled over shoulders, being stretched in multiple directions, etcetera, would feel to a sentient bra, so I’m playing it safe.  Once I’ve worn you for a while maybe you will reconsider helping me after you been up close and personal with my-slash-your boobs.  They’re on me but you designed them so let’s see how you feel about our girls by around noon tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Excuse me Jane I’m going to go get ready for bed, don’t go anywhere.”  Jeff said, and went to the bathroom to shower and brush his teeth.  He came back wearing only a robe and was about to remove it in front of his sister but that felt weird; she could still see after all.  So, he went into the closet and put on his pajama bottoms but came out topless.  “OK Jane here we go let’s see how good a bra you are.”  Jeff said.  He didn’t care about showing his breasts as he’d had them for less than a day and had little to no attachment.  They were just bulbous protrusions that had been bonded to him against his will.<br />
<br />
Jeff began pulling Jane on over his head and into place.  While he didn’t know it, what the Chronivac came up with was something very much alike a racerback maternity and sleeping bra.   Per his request the fit was exactly perfect for him in every dimension.  It was infinitely better than the one his mother had given him this morning.  The material was extremely soft and comfortable.  He decided to tease Jane just a bit so he did some jumping jacks and then just bounced lightly on his toes to get a feel for the support.  Then he shook his boobs back and forth for a bit.  While the support was very good, he knew that if he were to really exercise hard, he’d need a sports bra or have to turn Jane into one.  While he was moving around the fabric teased his feminine nipples causing them to become erect and push into Jane.  Lying to himself that he only did it to tease his sister Jeff cupped his boobs through the bra for a bit and then made little circles around the areolas.  Jeff realized he was going a bit far and put his arms at his sides.  A bit sheepishly said “That’s enough for tonight Jane um, well, goodnight, sleep well.”<br />
<br />
He turned out the lights and got into bed, but it took him quite awhile to come down from his arousal and fall asleep.<br />
<br />
Did you know that sentient bras cannot sleep?  They’re just conscious all the time.</p>
