<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Today was the first day he had ever really been confronted with this option, sure the fantasy was nice, but was it worth it?<br />
<br />
What would be different? Would people treat him differently? Lucas didn’t really need anything to change about himself, yet he was so horny that he couldn’t deny how he felt. So why should he stop himself? There was no going back once the operation began, and after that everything would be different. He might never be himself again. If he wanted it, he could leave here today without his manhood ever getting in the way again. Couldn’t he? A small part of him still believed that things would be better, but a larger part of him worried that the fantasy of losing it all wasn’t nearly as good as the reality.<br />
<br />
His hand crept down under the table, rubbing his aching cock through his pants. He knew it wouldn’t go far, but he needed something to hold onto while he made this life altering decision. Suddenly Dr. Smiths broke into his thoughts. “I’ll step out for a few minutes. You’ll have to decide soon, if we’re going to do this today, though.”<br />
<br />
He quickly reached for the door handle, paused for a second, then exited.<br />
<br />
The sun outside was hot and bright, shining through the window behind Lucas. It warmed his exposed legs and kept him warm. Lucas sat there for a moment. He didn’t really want this. His fingers curled into fists and his jaw clenched shut, attempting to force the stress away. For the past week he had been thinking more and more about having a sex change, but he was doing so out of pure sexual frustration. Risking it all was just too much.<br />
<br />
Apparently there had been a miscommunication, because not five minutes later a nurse walked in on Lucas. He had taken his pants off, which she took as a sign to get him prepped for surgery. She wasted no time telling him to put on the hospital gown they gave him earlier and pull it up past his knees. In the middle of lifting his arms to tie the sash she stopped and gave the noticeably nervous boy a small white pill. “This will help you feel a little better.” Without explaining it was a fast acting sedative, not enough to make him sleep, but definitely enough to make him suggestible. Lucas was so caught up in the decision that he hardly realized what was going on, and didn’t bother asking questions. At least not until Dr. Smiths returned shortly afterwards.<br />
<br />
“I see you’re getting ready, I assume this means we should get underway?” Lucas felt confident, all his fear of the surgery washed away. He couldn’t explain it but he trusted this man implicitly. Even if he changed his mind in a few months he could always opt for the standard treatment and live the rest of his life as a woman. It wouldn’t matter, either way he would be happier than he had ever been. He decided right then and there to just let the doctors do their job and hope that this whole thing worked out. Before he could speak, however, Dr. Smiths cut him off. “You don’t have to worry about what happens next. After the procedure we can tell you more about post op care, but I promise that we’ll take excellent care of you from here on out. Now relax and enjoy yourself. We’re going to do great work together today.”<br />
<br />
As soon as Lucas heard those words he felt like crying. What if he hated having a vagina? Would he want to reverse it? The thought scared him more than any potential complications during or after the operation. Would he be content living with this body forever? Who would he be now? Would he even be the same person? Was it possible to change back to being a guy?<br />
<br />
Those were things he could worry about tomorrow. Today was a special day, and he had chosen to do something amazing. The last few weeks since first seeing Jeff’s neomangina seemed like a blur, and before long he was lying on the operating table waiting for them to begin the procedure.<br />
<br />
The doctor started talking as he inserted a needle into his back. “Lucas we are going to give you an epidural now, so we won’t have to worry about numbing you when we cut you open. Once that is done I will prep your penis for its transformation. With luck, by the end of today you’ll have a beautiful, functioning female vagina!”<br />
<br />
The doctor said those words as if it were nothing. Lucas found it hard to imagine such a large part of his body turning into something else. “Nurse, a little more sedation.”<br />
<br />
He suddenly felt woozy, and was drifting in and out of consciousness. It felt like someone was tugging on his bits, and it felt really numb. All he could think about was Jeff’s vagina, and wondering what kind of sensation he would be feeling inside his own new one. <br />
<br />
The doctor kept going. “Right. Second one… out! Congratulations Lucas! Your testicles are gone, we’re halfway there!”<br />
<br />
For some reason he liked hearing that they were half way there. Perhaps it meant they were doing well so far. Either way, he relaxed a bit. Maybe all of this was just right. That it was going exactly how it should. Maybe this was how he was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he felt a rush of cold air on his crotch. He looked down and saw that Dr. Smiths had cut off the scrotum. He gestured something to the nurse but Lucas couldn’t quite make it out.<br />
<br />
The room went black again and the next thing he knew, he was waking up in a more comfortable bed. His entire groin area felt tight and hot, like it had a fever. There was also an annoying stinging sensation in his urethra, but whatever that was he hoped it would go away soon. The painkillers must be working pretty good because he didn’t feel much discomfort otherwise.<br />
<br />
Sometime later he was visited by another nurse who told him everything went perfectly, and apologized overshooting the sedation a little. They wanted to keep him there over the weekend and asked if he wanted to call anyone. His parents wouldn’t wonder, it wasn’t too rare for him to stay over at friends houses, and he’d just tell them he decided to go fishing for the weekend with the boys. Instead he called Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff answered almost immediately. “Oh hey Lucas! Sorry to hear you got into trouble at school. Hopefully you aren’t grounded or anything!”<br />
<br />
Lucas blushed a bit and tried to cover up the lie he had told Jeff for why he wasn’t in class today. “Yeah, no worries dude. No punishment, so don’t worry about me. I just missed a couple days.”<br />
<br />
Lucas looked down at his bandaged pelvis and felt relief. He almost chickened out but by pure chance, or maybe negligence, he went through with the vaginoplasty. Everything had gone perfect. Not only that, but he now had a nice girl’s pussy and neither dick nor balls. It was like magic. How did he not see it coming? It just seemed too easy. Too natural.<br />
<br />
It took him a moment to snap back to reality. “Errr…. Hey, Jeff! Actually, I lied about getting in trouble at school today. Um, it’s actually kind of a big deal. Sorry about that See, uhm, I sorta kinda got myself a sex change…”<br />
<br />
Jeff paused briefly. “What?! What!? Are you kidding me!? Oh my god dude what happened?!! Why did you hide it from me? God, I don’t know. Seriously, I really don’t know.” Jeff never told Lucas his surgery wasn’t actually a choice. But after their mutual encounter Jeff and Lucas were both okay with it. They joked about boys who were sexually attracted to their own dicks, and women who had hairy chests. Neither ever thought they might actually have it.<br />
<br />
But it seemed fate was giving them what they needed.<br />
<br />
“Just get down here, I haven’t even seen it yet.” Lucas said with excitement.<br />
<br />
“I will be there as soon as possible, alright buddy. Thanks for telling me though, seriously. Now you have to tell me every detail, okay?”<br />
<br />
As Lucas heard Jeff hang up the phone, he smiled, and was glad he didn’t chicken out after all.<br />
<br />
The unpacking felt surreal to Lucas. He sat up as best he could while still providing the doctor with the best possible view he could of the bandages, Lucas wanted to see everything. Slowly the wrapping came undone. He couldn’t really tell how much bulge he had lost because of how thick they were, but when his privates came into full view he knew his world had changed.<br />
<br />
He was flat as can be. All that was left of his once impressive penis was a small pink clitoris, nestled in between the folds of his labia.  When he pressed it gently with the tips of his fingers, a soft nub emerged. It was truly beautiful. The color of dark red blood. And even though the overall shape of his vagina hadn’t fully come together yet, he was ecstatic.  This was real.<br />
<br />
Still protruding from his groin was a catheter. No more using a urinal, I guess. Either side of it, his labia were pink and swollen, still bound by stitches. Soon the bandages came off completely, and he stared openly at the face of his new vagina.<br />
<br />
Some might have said it wasn’t pretty, wasn’t sexy. It still had a long way to go before he was done healing. It didn’t even look feminine yet. But when compared to his formerly manly penis and testicles, the new girl parts were breathtaking. So delicate. So vulnerable. Just begging for love and attention. Lucas was ready to give her plenty of both.</p>
