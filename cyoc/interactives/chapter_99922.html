<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark heard a knock at the door of The apartment, and went to answer it. It was Natalie their neighbor and Jessie&#39;s best friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mark,&quot; she said shyly. Natalie always had a thing for Mark and kind of felt sorry for the way Jessie treated him. &quot;Is Jessie around?&quot;<br />
<br />
He thought for a second and then told her &quot;She&#39;s out now but might come back sometime soon. Why don&#39;t you come in for a bit and wait for her?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay&quot;, Natalie went into the living room and Mark went into the kitchen. He thought over what this meant. Natalie had always been so sweet to him. True, she didn&#39;t have the best looks but she wasn&#39;t really ugly. Natalie was dressed pretty casual in a pair of jeans, t-shirt, and running shoes. Not exactly flattering to her plain body. She was by no means overweight, but she was not blessed with a very feminine body. She had wide shoulders, a thick frame, no curves to speak of, a small undefined chest and a flat butt. Her arms and legs were short and thick like a man&#39;s. From the back, if not for her hairstyle, you would mistake her for a guy. Her hair was straight and nicely styled: shoulder length and an Orange red color. She had a cute face, a little button nose, pouty lips, a clear complexion, and almond shaped green eyes with long lashes with the sexiest pair of glasses he&#39;s ever seen on a chick.<br />
<br />
With a little work, Natalie could&#39;ve been a real knockout. That&#39;s when he decided to give it a go. After getting her something to drink, Mark sat down with Natalie on the couch and started having conversations with her. Soon, he decided to get into the correct territory.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know&quot;, he began, &quot;Natalie, you are one of the nicest girls I&#39;ve ever met. I can&#39;t help but wonder why you&#39;re best friends with Jesse when she&#39;s so... so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesse?&quot;, she asked with a grin. They both chuckled. &quot;I&#39;ll admit, she can be a real pain. But... being friends with her has some benefits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;, asked Mark, as he silently wished that she would answer truthfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like getting to meet you&quot;, said Natalie. Her eyes widened widened in shock. &quot;I mean...&quot; She covered her mouth and blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;, asked an intrigued Mark. &quot;What do you mean by that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I just really like being around you. You&#39;re funny, you&#39;re nice, and I&#39;ve always had a thing for you. In fact, I think I&#39;m falling for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing the fear in her eyes, Mark silently undid his truth wish on her. &quot;Natalie&quot;, he said. &quot;I... I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;, she sobbed. &quot;I need to go.&quot; She put her drink on the coffee table and was about to leave when Mark grabbed her arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Natalie&quot;, he said reassuringly. &quot;It&#39;s okay. I actually think I feel the same way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark&quot;, she said. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;re married and, as much as I want to, I can&#39;t be with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; he said, already pulling out the coin and grasping it. &quot;But I just have to know... If I weren&#39;t married,... would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused, and Mark could see tears forming in her eyes. There was a slight nod, but no real reply as she just pulled herself out of his grip and started for the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;, said Mark. &quot;I just wish that you were my wife and that Sophie was our daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, everything seemed to shimmer. All of the photos with Mark and Jesse changed. Instead of the deadpan appearance of Mark and Jesse, they showed a happy couple and a few pictures came to be, showing them with a beautiful baby girl. A wedding ring appeared on Natalie&#39;s finger as she turned to Mark, her tears having disappeared along with her running shoes. Her hips widened to child-bearing size. She blinked, new memories forming in both their minds. While Mark still remembered his old life, he also remembered this new one, but Natalie only had the new memories.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Honey&quot;, she said while putting a hand to her forehead. &quot;What was that you said?&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled. &quot;I said that I must be the luckiest man in the world to have such an amazing wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw...&quot;, she walked right over to Mark and kissed him on the lips. When it was over, Natalie broke the kiss and smiled to him. &quot;So, what was it you were wanting to talk to me about? Something about a coin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot;, he said, showing her the wishing coin. He explained it to her just as he had with Jesse, but instead of getting an angry response, Natalie looked worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark&quot;, she asked, &quot;Are you feeling alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, Natalie.&quot;, he said. &quot;Look, I already tested it and now I&#39;m much smarter. Listen, the value of pi is 3.14159...&quot; He kept going for quite a few numbers before stopping. &quot;You know how bad I&#39;ve always been with math before. How else can I be so good with it now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie looked at him for a moment and hesitated before asking, &quot;Maybe we could try a different test, just to make sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. You&#39;ve been coming to me worried about your looks, and you shouldn&#39;t by the way, but I have something that can help you regardless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie looked at him with a bit of annoyance. &quot;You&#39;re wanting to change my looks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but you do, and I want you to be happy.&quot; He held out the wishing coin. &quot;I wish you had the appearance you always wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie was about to poke fun at him when she felt an intense tingling throughout her entire body. To her shock, her body started transforming. The baggy jeans she was wearing became skin tight, and the unisex t-shirt she was wearing became a womans&#39;s tee. The sleeves were tiny showing off her large shoulders. It was also very low cut, and short, exposing some of her waist. At the moment it wasn&#39;t very flattering to her body. Natalie&#39;s Bra started to fill up. Her A-cups inflated becoming fuller and rounder as her frame got smaller, the top half of her body becoming more petite. The small T-shirt complemented her top now. Her arms were small and feminine and her shoulders had narrowed.<br />
Her breasts were now big and perky, they stood out on her smaller frame. Natalie&#39;s waist got thinner, and her Jeans dropped lower on from her waist to her shapely hips. Natalie&#39;s butt lifted and protruded slightly. Her Orange red hair darkened till it was a deep red and grew long and straight till it reached past her butt  and gained much more volume. It couldn&#39;t be contained behind her back, flowing over her shoulders in soft waves.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the world?&quot;, she exclaimed. Natalie turned around and looked in a nearby mirror to see the vision that she had become. She couldn&#39;t help but stare in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like it?&quot;, asked Mark hesitantly. &quot;If this is too much, I can change you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot;, said Natalie. &quot;I... I love it.&quot; She turned to her husband happily and hugged him again. &quot;This is amazing. I look... amazing! Mark thank you so much! You&#39;re the best husband I could ever have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark hugged back, happy to now have a wife that appreciated him. This coin was going to make their life together so much better.<br />
Finally she grew a couple inches as her legs grew thinner and Longer.</p>
