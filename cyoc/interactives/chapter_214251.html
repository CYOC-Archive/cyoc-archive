<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I saw this hot ass guy at trader joe’s<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I can’t even afford the place honestly, but I was picking up someone’s grocery order for the delivery service I work for. He was telling his girlfriend how much he needed to get fucked and how he wanted her to strap him right when they got home.<br />
<br />
“Not today honey, I’m not in a sexy mood,” his wife said. Clearly she wasn’t as excited about the prospect of fucking her straight husband’s butt and he was for it.<br />
<br />
“But I wanna get fuuuucked,” he moaned. <br />
<br />
He must’ve only whispered those desperate horny thoughts to his wife because he thought they were alone in the isle, because he was surprised to see me smirking about how needy his bottom was. He decided to wipe the smirk off of my face by saying, “By my hot wife, not by some skinny faggot.”<br />
<br />
Yep, he accomplished his goal of ruining my good time, I walked away with my basket to finish my shop. When I was checking out, I noticed that he and his wife had just rung out and were walking towards the exit. He turned his head and glared at me. I was just going to look away, but our eyes locked like magnets. Suddenly I was next to his wife, looking at my own body in the checkout line. Both of our expressions changed to a mix of denial and surprise. We had somehow switched bodies!<br />
<br />
“Come on honey, we gotta get the frozen food home!” My new wife said at my dumbfounded expression. Huh. And I had promised myself to never be a gay man with a wife. Oh well. Going home and pretending this was my life would give me a chance to explore this sexy body.<br />
<br />
My former body now had a look of betrayal on his face. His expression seemed to say “Is my wife really leaving with an imposter?!” He wanted to go after us but he was still in line and didn’t want to cause a scene. He was powerless as my new wife started up our car and drove us home.<br />
<br />
We unpacked the groceries, which was surprisingly easy in a house that wasn’t my own. Not because I had somehow gained any information from my new body, just because we had bought hardly anything. These rich people must go shopping every day. Sheesh.<br />
<br />
‘My’ wife said she needed to go lay down. Worked more than fine for me. Now I could do some snooping and learn a thing or two about this life that I somehow got thrown into. I felt like the guy on Quantum Leap. Except I didn’t still see myself with my old body in mirrors. I saw this hunky straight douchebro’s body. Fine by me. It was my hot body for the moment. I found that my new name was Brian Wolf. Sounds like a porn name if you asked me. <br />
<br />
I was 50, and I had one son whose id says he’s about to turn 19. Fuck, the son was hot too. I rubbed my new daddy dick looking at my son’s picture. My new dick was responsive and chubbed up. Happy to see I still wasn’t straight in Brian’s body, I also could feel my prostate, and the pressure it was making in my anus. This guy really did need to get fucked.<br />
<br />
As quietly as I could, I went into the master bedroom to snoop for some revealing clothing. My wife was sleeping like a Rhino. I probably could’ve come in banging pots and pans and still wouldn’t have woken her up. I found the strap on that she apparently uses on Brian’s butt. Depending on how long I was in his body, she’d never use it on his butt again lol. The dildo was surprisingly small; four inches long and maybe below the thickness of an average cock. This Brian guy clearly hadn’t overstretched his hole if this cute little toy was fucking him into submission.<br />
<br />
Since none of Brian’s underwear were particularly sexy (all boxers and boxer briefs), I decided to wear nothing but underarmor leggings. This was my house, after all. A man can be good and naked in his own home. <br />
<br />
I went back to my son Brad’s room where I found the id that showed he was 18. I riffled through his laundry basket and found that my new son was a tighty whities wearer. Hot. I wasted no time taking the worn tighty whities to my face and huffing my new son’s scent. I rubbed my cock and my ass through my under-armor while looking in Brad’s mirror. Watching Brian’s cock stretch to its full size in the under-armor was fun.<br />
<br />
I checked Brad’s Mac out of curiosity. To my great surprise, it wasn’t even password protected. What almost 19 year old doesn’t password protect their laptop? I guess his parents normally give him his space. I went through his web history. It turned out that young Bradley was not only gay, but had a father/son incest kink. I was so horny finding that out that I almost just jerked my new cock and spat a load out right there. But I knew this could be worth the wait.<br />
<br />
I waited in these people’s giant living room for Brad to return home. It was hard to take my mind off of the fact that I was in some straight dilf’s body and could go literally fuck myself if I wanted to. And I did want to. But I wanted son cock even more. Luckily I wouldn’t have to wait long for Brad.<br />
<br />
Brad was coming home at the perfect time. The boring program I’d put on the tv had finally killed my boner. I went up to the front door before he reached in on the outside. I opened the door to greet him and to thank his friend for dropping him off. His friend, who was also a jock boy, could see me half naked at the open doorway. I think I nearly made him crash as I waved him goodbye with my junk jiggling around in my skimpy outfit. It felt so good to be a slutty dad.<br />
<br />
“Dad! What are you doing coming to the door like that?” Brad asked me. He was hotter than his id picture, and wearing exercise shorts and a t-shirt. My eyes went straight to tracking his package.<br />
<br />
“Don’t I even get a hug from my son?” I said, my new dick twitching.<br />
<br />
Brad looked kind of taken aback that I even asked for a hug, let alone while I was wearing this little clothing. But I could see eagerness in his eyes.<br />
<br />
I gestured the boy to ‘bring it in’ for a hug. Really he was a complete stranger, and only a few years younger than me. But to him, I was his 50 year old straight dad. The thrill of impersonating Brian and the prospect of rubbing up on his son as him was making my cock chub up. I pulled Brad into a tight bear hug and moved my hips from side to side to grind our groins together.<br />
<br />
“Dad!” Bradly exclaimed at barely a whisper. <br />
<br />
Brad’s face was bright pink and his pupils were starting to dilate from the oxytocin. He tried to pull away so that I wouldn’t feel his cock getting hard, but I grabbed his hips and pinned him in place as I made strong eye contact with him and grinned, saying, “Your mom’s asleep for the night. I thought maybe we could finally spend some one-on-one father-son time.”</p>
