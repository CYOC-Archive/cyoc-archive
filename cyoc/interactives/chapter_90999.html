<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, I woke to being lifted out of bed. Blake put me back in the rat cage. Then he dressed in running gear.<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;I usually start my day with a morning jog. I thought you might like a morning jog as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
He left and I looked at the hamster wheel. I figured I might as well.<br />
<br />
When he came back, he fixed some breakfast and brought me some. He sat down in front of the rat cage to watch me eat while he had his breakfast.<br />
<br />
After breakfast, he asked if it was alright to try picking me up by my new tail. We tried it and he asked if it hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it doesn&#39;t hurt. It feels natural.&quot;<br />
<br />
So he carried me by my tail and set me on the sink while he shaved. He stripped to shave like I do to keep from getting itchy stubble in his clothes and I got a much closer look at his monster of a cock. Then he took a shower and I took a shower in the sink.<br />
<br />
After drying off, he picked me up by my tail again and took me to his bedroom where he got dressed. Then he took me to his office to gather my clothes.<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;Hey, can I get dressed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;I&#39;d like to take you with me today. I want to go back to the biology department and see if we can&#39;t work out an arrangement with them. I&#39;ll bring the shrink ray and your clothes so you can go from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Alright&quot; and he put me in his pants pocket. It was much easier to just curl up in his pocket than to try and poke my head out.<br />
<br />
We got to the biology department and most of the biologists were there. Blake pulled me out by my tail and said, &quot;We were a little extra cruel to this lab rat. I think we owe him an apology.&quot;<br />
<br />
The biologist listened as I explained. &quot;The frame was comfortable at first but after more than twenty-four hours locked in that frame without food or water, it was torture. You need to respect my limits.&quot;<br />
<br />
The biologists apologized. Blake asked if I&#39;d like to stick around a while. I told him I had a couple of hours.<br />
<br />
I got to talking to Tim, one of the biologists, and learned that Blake had often hung around the biology department and his inventions did often have a biology angle but Blake couldn&#39;t be one of the biologists because his area of expertise was technology and that caused a lingo barrier.<br />
<br />
Tim said, &quot;That is until you came along. You&#39;re his ticket into this group. I was wondering if I could compare a mouse&#39;s maze skill to a human&#39;s. Would you mind running a maze today?&quot;<br />
<br />
I agreed and he lifted me by my tail and put me in a box. &quot;This is so you can&#39;t see the maze from above and cheat.&quot;<br />
<br />
I heard some wooden pieces being shuffled around and then a door in the side of my box opened and I entered the maze. I had to duck because of a plastic ceiling that let people see me but did not let me climb over walls. The biologist teased me, &quot;You&#39;re not going to let a mouse beat you, are you?&quot; I tried moving faster than found myself in a dead end. I turned around and then I got lost. After a while, I found myself back at the starting box. I turned around only to hear that the mouse had won. I lost to a mouse.<br />
<br />
We ran the mazes a few more times and I got better. I still lost but the last time, I found my way to the cheese seconds after the mouse did.<br />
<br />
Then Tim had me try some other lab rat activities like trying to guess which button opened the food container or trying to manipulate a latch with my nose. Several of these were easy but it was amazing how many times a mouse or a pigeon or a baby chick performed better than I did. It was humiliating.<br />
<br />
Blake got jealous. He told Tim, &quot;That&#39;s my lab rat. You have to ask me for permission.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Blake, you don&#39;t own me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim took me over to another challenge.<br />
<br />
Later he asked me, &quot;I&#39;m a little confused where your limits are. You act like a lab rat.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure where my limits are either. They&#39;ve moved a lot since I was first shrunk. I would have never dreamed I&#39;d be acting like a lab rat but it&#39;s kind of fun. Just treat me humane like you treat the other lab rats.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim then started examining me like a lab rat. He asked me to run on a hamster wheel and he monitored my pulse. He had me lift weights to see how strong I was. He asked for a urine sample and I gave him one. Then he started to milk me.<br />
<br />
Pete happened to come in at that time and asked Tim, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim said, &quot;I&#39;m getting a semen sample.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete looked down at me and asked, &quot;You&#39;re letting him get another semen sample? I thought the demonstration was over.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was so embarrassed but Tim already had my dick in one hand and a probe deep up my ass. I thought fast.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re paying me to be a lab rat. They need to test some things on a human. Isn&#39;t that right, Tim.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim said, &quot;Er, um, yeah. Here, you can probe his ass while I collect his semen.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked back and my friend Pete took the probe and was probing my ass. I covered my face in shame. Then Pete said, &quot;Let me do that too.&quot; and I felt a transfer of hands and Pete was doing all the milking.<br />
<br />
I shot a load and Tim pretended to collect it on a slide. I stood up and breathed a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Pete asked, &quot;How many samples do you need?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim said, &quot;As many as we can get. Why don&#39;t you see if you can squeeze five more out of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave Tim a dirty look and Pete forcefully bent me over. I spread my legs to let the probe back in and Pete started milking me again.<br />
<br />
He asked, &quot;What do you say buddy. You got five more loads.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll try.&quot; The second load was fairly easy.<br />
<br />
Pete withdrew the probe and I sighed again but Pete picked me up with one hand and held my legs in such a way to spread my butt cheeks. Then he lowered me onto the probe which he had set to point straight up. He turned me to face him before he started milking me again. The third load was a struggle but I shot a third time.<br />
<br />
He asked, &quot;You hanging in there buddy? Got three more loads?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shook my head.<br />
<br />
He asked, &quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Play with my balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fourth and fifth load took forever and the sixth load was almost invisible. Tim put my sixth load under a microscope. Paul let go of my legs allowing me to stand up but the probe was still inside me.<br />
<br />
Pete asked, &quot;Is there a reason you&#39;re not milking yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim answered, &quot;That&#39;s not the best way to get a semen sample. He could misfire without someone guiding him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Tim said, &quot;For such a small sample, this last one has a lot of active swimmers. Let&#39;s try to get one more sample.&quot;<br />
<br />
My genitals were aching at this point. Pete didn&#39;t pick me up but leaving me on the probe, he stroked my dick with one hand and fondled my balls with the other. It took an agonizingly long time before I finally shot load number seven and nearly passed out. Pete picked me up and cradled me.<br />
<br />
Pete said, &quot;Good job. You did it. Maybe I&#39;ll drop by for a visit again but I need to find Professor Bittern.<br />
<br />
He handed me over to Tim and I whispered to Tim, &quot;I&#39;ll get you sometime. I&#39;ll get you. I&#39;m done today and ready to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim set me down and I looked for Blake but Blake was nowhere around. Neither was the shrink ray or my clothes.</p>
