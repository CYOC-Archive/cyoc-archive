<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew was rather downfallen at that moment. He&#39;d found where the girl he&#39;d dreamed about had been in the hospital, but he&#39;d been unable to actually meet with her and introduce himself properly, which was what he wanted to do. Henry Wendz had offered him and his siblings help and advice, provided they help him various projects. Fearful of arrest based on what Wendz had told them, Andrew, his brother Adam, and his sister Mary agreed, even if they didn&#39;t fully understand what Wendz was doing. For Andrew, it became completely worth it when Wendz promised a way to be with the girl he&#39;d dreamed of.<br />
<br />
But for the most part, Henry Wendz&#39;s plan hadn&#39;t fully worked. As far as Andrew knew, Dr. Wendz had assured that his dream girl truly became his dream girl, but he&#39;d also been captured by Moon Lake&#39;s police and hospital security. From there, Andrew really didn&#39;t know on what happened to him. Andrew had managed to escape them then, but he&#39;d still maintained some determination to find some way to meet and talk to the girl he&#39;d dreamed of. He was certain she was his true love and would do what he could to protect her to the best of his ability.<br />
<br />
That had then come during the night. He&#39;d returned to the hospital area to watch over her and found a weregecko on a tree branch overlooking the area where his dream girl&#39;s room was. Not knowing his purposes, Andrew forced the weregecko to leave and stayed in the tree to guard the girl his dreams told him he&#39;d love. That proved to be a mistake as hospital security caught him early in the morning before he could leave, and when he proved tough enough that they couldn&#39;t easily overpower Andrew, they Tased him and put him restraints, which ultimately lead to where he was now in the Moon Lake Police Station with one of the hospital&#39;s security officers and a pair of Moon Lake Police Officers standing over him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never seen a weregorilla before,&quot; one of the police officers said slowly, &quot;do you know if there are any registered in Moon Lake?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know,&quot; the hospital security officer said slowly, &quot;I&#39;ve never seen one in Moon Lake, either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moon Lake did keep a registry of the were species living in the city. A lot of it was to help provide for medical needs, such as blood transfusions and so on. But that registry was only with regard to the weres living in Moon Lake, and at present, weregorillas weren&#39;t on that list. In fact it was that fact that had brought Rick Plunkett to Moon Lake in the first place when Adam or Andrew had been spotted in their fursona near the Tucker family&#39;s ranch and was reported as a possible Sasquatch sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s probably just new, which isn&#39;t the problem at hand,&quot; the second police officer told both his compatriots blink.<br />
<br />
That made Andrew blink in some surprise, as Dr. Wendz had told him and his siblings that they would be arrested for not being on that registry. He was certain that would be part of the reasons for his arrest.<br />
<br />
&quot;The problem is that we have a new were who&#39;s gone through an incredibly traumatic experience and needing privacy having that privacy violated by some reporter who snapped photos to the press before the hospital was ready to give a press release,&quot; that second officer continued, &quot;and this guy was caught in the same area. Which means he&#39;s likely the one who invaded the new were&#39;s privacy. And at least he was in his fursona during the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t take any pictures,&quot; Andrew protested weakly, &quot;I only wished to protect her.&quot;<br />
<br />
This then attracted the attention of the present officers to him, and likely betrayed that some of their comments given were part of an overall plan regarding what they wanted to get out of Andrew. But Andrew really wasn&#39;t the sort to really think strategically enough to have any sort of awareness that went far enough ahead one way or the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Protect her?&quot; the hospital security officer asked, &quot;Protect her from what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The guy I saw taking the photos,&quot; Andrew answered honestly, &quot;to give her privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you DIDN&#39;T take the photos that made it to Moon Lake Public Access?&quot; the first police officer asked, &quot;than who did?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a weregecko, I saw him use the tree and started taking photos...&quot; Andrew answered, &quot;I can&#39;t give you his name... I just knew what he was doing wasn&#39;t right and I had to protect her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Protect her?&quot; the hospital security officer asked again as he looked to Andrew with some suspicion. The line made some sense with regard to why the weregorilla was present at the hospital, however, its simplicity still made no sense as to why the weregorilla they&#39;d caught was wanting to protect the new Rikki Tucker. As far as they knew, she&#39;d only just become female, let alone a were. Yet, this weregorilla seemed to be acting as though he&#39;d known Rikki for years and that they&#39;d been long time lovers and that made no sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe me,&quot; Andrew said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try us,&quot; the second police officer spoke.<br />
<br />
With that Andrew tried to explain, starting with what he described as a vivid prophecy dream of him ultimately meeting a young werecheetah who revealed to him that she had once been a he, but had become a fully functional female. That the werecheetah he&#39;d met in his dreams had gone from a complete male to a complete female complete with ovaries and a female were&#39;s heat cycle. The only thing that delayed any marriage between the two was that the werecheetah&#39;s transformation from a normal human male to a fully female werecheetah had also made her younger. Perhaps not to the point where interest couldn&#39;t form, but definitely at an age difference where Andrew would have to wait for the werecheetah to mature before they could legally marry.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re stalking this girl because you had a prophecy dream that identified a werecheetah that had once been male as your future mate?&quot; the second officer asked. He&#39;d known well enough about prophecy dreams and that many weres put a fair amount of faith that they provided either warnings or assurances on the future, but he&#39;d never put much faith in them. As he&#39;d had a dream once where on his twenty fifth birthday, he&#39;d get unbelievably drunk and would wake up to find that he&#39;d spent the night with a werefox vixen that was fully bonded to him. He was now twenty eight... no vixen was bonded to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not stalking,&quot; Andrew answered, &quot;protecting. I&#39;d hoped for an honest meeting the way normal people would meet... but my brother and sister and I are new to the area... and Doctor Wendz said Moon Lake would be prejudiced against weregorillas, leaving us a bit afraid. Mary works at the local hotel, but she has to use a lot of perfume... It doesn&#39;t hide that she is a were, as I&#39;m sure your noses would know... but it does serve to mask what kind of were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew remained totally honest on the situation. On some level, it was due to his feeling that he hadn&#39;t done anything wrong. On other levels it related to the fears he had. He was caught and they likely wouldn&#39;t just let him introduce himself to the new werecheetah. In that, regardless of what Dr. Wendz had urged of him, the least he could do was make sure that the werecheetah got to live a happy life, even if it ultimately meant his dreams wouldn&#39;t come true. He felt he loved her that much.<br />
<br />
The two police officers then traded glances with the hospital security officer. They all picked up on the mention of &quot;Doctor Wendz&quot; in that he&#39;d been arrested the previous day on trespassing and interfering in the treatment of a patient charges. They had also gotten some update from Kathy Tucker that Wendz may have killed a human male as part of his own experiments into were genetics and the mono-gendered strains of the were-virus in which he&#39;d tested his retrovirus on a human male to turn him female, and this may have in fact worked, but the following introduction of the standard werecat strain of the werevirus then killed the new woman thanks to the transformation&#39;s strain on the heart. <br />
<br />
Kathy Tucker&#39;s theory was that Wendz&#39;s retrovirus effectively killed the Y Chromosome, leaving the victim with only a healthy X Chromosome, matching the hormonal needs of a woman. The were-virus when paired with this retro-virus would then handle the physical needs to create a female body, and in pure theory it worked. But the new werecat&#39;s heart, left with only an X Chromosome and not a normal woman&#39;s XX Chromosome, couldn&#39;t handle the transformation. They had found a dead werecat, and assumed at the time that this werecat had died due to an incomplete transformation or was one where there had been some hormone imbalance that while extremely rare was to a point that when she went under her first transformation that her heart couldn&#39;t handle the strain of transformation. When the body was first discovered, that made sense... however... they had no name or family. None of the known werecat families knew her and none of the known werecat families were related to her. As such, she&#39;d been marked as a Jane Doe.<br />
<br />
Rikki&#39;s transformation, however, brought a new theory that Doctor Tucker had offered to the Moon Lake PD. The Jane Doe shouldn&#39;t have been treated as a Jane Doe, but rather a John Doe and that Henry Wendz was illegally experimenting with a specially designed retrovirus that was then combined with the were virus. Which had meant that the only reason Rikki had survived this process to become a healthy werecheetah was the fact that as Rick, he&#39;d had a rare syndrome involving the fact that he&#39;d had a naturally existing extra X Chromosome. When Wendz&#39;s retrovirus destroyed his Y Chromosome, that extra X was able to take natural prominence and thus allowed Rick to safely become Rikki. It saved Rikki&#39;s live, but gave Kathy the sense that Wendz&#39;s experiments hand killed a normal human being.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you know about Doctor Wendz?&quot; the first police officer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He found my brother and sister when we arrived, trying to find shelter,&quot; Andrew answered, &quot;he said that Moon Lake would persecute weregorillas but that he&#39;d keep us safe if we helped him. He even offered to help find my dream girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
The two officers sighed and then took the hospital security officer out into the hallway outside the interrogation room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; they asked the security officer.<br />
<br />
&quot;From the way he talks... I&#39;d think he&#39;s honest,&quot; the security officer spoke, &quot;BUT it&#39;d seem like his entire mode of operations is based off of a supposed prophecy dream. Add in a sicko like Wendz and all you have is trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; the second police officer nodded, &quot;I&#39;d wager that when Wendz found these three the duped them into not coming in openly... I mean... &quot;Moon Lake persecuting weregorillas?&quot; Most of the town is a were of some kind, and the town&#39;s elders are all old enough to have either known human persecution of weres at some point or had parents to grandparents that knew about it. Wendz only strung them along... maybe even consciously planning things out as they developed if he knew this guy was having prophecy dreams about a werecheetah that had &quot;once been male.&quot; You know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d make sense,&quot; the first officer nodded, &quot;but it&#39;d still mean that this guy was... is... an accomplice in Wendz&#39;s activities. Perhaps unwilling or unknowing, but still an accomplice.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other two both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;The one thing I&#39;d have for certain is that we need Frances Twist to get some psych evaluation on this guy,&quot; the hospital security officer commented, &quot;and we may need to get Samantha Twist to make contact with this &quot;Mary&quot; and set her straight that Moon Lake isn&#39;t prejudices against weregorillas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, the other two nodded.</p>
