<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ponius sat at his desk writing Emails. He was annoyed. The Equus situation was out of control. He had reports of a large ranch, but so far his people had been unable to locate it. Worse still, the colt was cutting significantly into the profit margin. Some of his best customers had stopped ordering and were obviously getting their beasts elsewhere. The rest were pushing prices down. Reports of missing persons and equines roaming the nearby city were also through the roof, and his government contacts were all having a cow. If this went on much longer he would have to fight the government and the colt.<br />
<br />
His intercom buzzed and the palomino demon stabbed the oversized button with a finger resembling a miniature hoof. “Speak”, he commanded.<br />
<br />
“It’s Traveler, sir. We have a large demonic spike on the remote monitors.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly Ponius’s attention was focused like a laser. “Is it the colt?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think so sir. It’s a signature I’ve never seen before. It’s a little over 500 miles away in the city of Glendale.”<br />
<br />
“What’s the intensity level?” Ponius started punching up the displays on his desk computer.<br />
<br />
“You can see for your self, it’s gone from barely there to off the scale in about an hour. It’s still building. It looks like we may have multiple new demons operating from the look of it, and they are powering up.” There was a small amount of fear detectable in Traveler’s voice.<br />
<br />
“Damn you Traveler, don’t go high strung thoroughbred on me! I don’t have time for one of your neighing freak-outs!” Ponius slammed his fist on the reinforced oak desk for emphasis. It did no real damage but the booming report that could be heard throughout the park Admin building had the desired effect.<br />
<br />
“Sorry sir, I’ll take a calm pill”, Traveler followed up with an apologetic snort.<br />
<br />
“I want a recovery team dispatched on an emergency basis to Glendale. I want our special weapons team to go with them. If these unknown demons can’t be captured, I want them killed!” Ponius let his anger run away and unleashed a shrieking whinny of anger.<br />
<br />
 “Yes sir. I’ll see to it at once.” Traveler’s calm demeanor had returned. The tranquilizers were fast acting fortunately.<br />
<br />
“Tell Thunderhoof he is in charge and there better not be any screw-ups. It’s about time he earned all the virgin mares I feed him.” Ponius knew that despite Traveler’s little problem, he was the most reliable second in command he had yet found. Business would be taken care of.<br />
<br />
“Yes sir, I’ll dispatch the teams at once. They should be on station in about two hours.”<br />
Ponius sighed. He knew they had no corrupted stables that far out. Two hours was light speed for an operation that distant. “Monitor the situation. Keep me posted.”<br />
<br />
============================================================================================<br />
<br />
Two equine heads snapped around in Donk’s direction as soon as he revealed himself. Both brothers snorted and inhaled Donk’s scent. The little brother spoke first. Judging by the fact that he was fucking his big brother in the ass, he is now the dominant demon.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm. A donkey demon. One with some power though I see”, the young Clydesdale thought for a moment. “Sure. Lay on the floor. I hope you are as skilled as you look.”<br />
<br />
Donk grinned and lay on the cum soaked floor. This was about the reaction he was expecting, and this was their home after all. While Donk was not certain exactly what they had in mind, it should tell him if they had any innate skills to go with those stud bodies.<br />
<br />
The still fucking brothers positioned themselves over Donk. “Hold your cock up”, the younger demon commanded.<br />
<br />
Donk willingly complied with the request as the larger brothers cock head neared his half-muzzle. Donk licked his lips and started sucking off  the larger brother as his partners started to kneel. Donk’s cock gradually penetrated the younger brother as the older brother’s cock was forced further and further down his throat.<br />
<br />
All of them started to buck and thrust together, the brothers emitting all manner of neighs and whinny’s. It brought back memories of the barn at their new ranch for Donk. Only his demonic body allowed Donk to breath with nearly two feet of cock down his throat. Still, it was amazing.<br />
<br />
They all pounded harder and faster until they all reached climax together. Then it happened. All three were enveloped in a blinding white light as magical energy flowed into all three of them. They had completed the circuit. <br />
<br />
Donk had reached this state before with Equus and some of the other demons. It was the best and quickest way to recharge magical energy. The brothers were astounded. Donk clamed the neighing freak-out going on in both brother’s heads.<br />
<br />
“Eazy boys! Eazy!......Woah! That’s good boys……Calm. Eazy. Keep fucking, but go eazy!”, gradually both brothers came back to their senses.<br />
<br />
“This is how our kind recharges spent magical energy”, Donk explained in their minds.<br />
“It takes a minimum of three. All must fuck and be fucked. You seemed to know it instinctively, but you need training. You need to learn the magic of our kind. I would be happy to teach you. In fact I was sent here to bring you home. You are in danger here.”<br />
<br />
“I was wondering how we would explain this to our parents, then I thought we would just corrupt them”, the older brother commented mentally.<br />
<br />
“Where would you take us?”, the younger brother asked. <br />
<br />
“Master Equus has a ranch. It is secure and protected. There are many animals and others who need breeding and corrupting. He wants to meet you.”<br />
<br />
“Protected from what?”, the younger brother sounded very skeptical.<br />
<br />
“Lord Ponius from Pleasure Island for one thing. I expect a capture team could arrive at any time. If they get you, you will not have a choice. You will work for them or die. If they get ahold of the curse you possess they will kill us all. Scan my mind. While we are linked none of us have secrets. Scan my memories and you will understand the dangers and what I offer.” Donk didn’t like this, but openness seemed the best way to convince the colts.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of being sifted and scanned the older brother spoke. “You made us like this!?”<br />
<br />
“Yes I did. It was I who flooded the cheerleader Jennifer with thoughts and images of equine sex. Then I did the same to you. Don’t even attempt to lie, you both love it.”<br />
This was a risky gambit with the brothers, but probably the only one that was likely to work.<br />
<br />
“Why would you do this??”, Corey asked.<br />
<br />
“Because I am a demon and we need the curse your brother carries. In order to work with us, you need some hide in the game. How could we trust you otherwise? The fact is eventually this world will be part of the Abyss if we succeed. The good news is you both stand to gain just as we do. Just think, an eternity filling your appetites and gaining power. You are already immortal you know, and high enough up the food chain that you will both be powers here if we are successful. Sorry kid, you were not part of the original plan. All we wanted was your brother, but I doubt you will be complaining much. Our lives are a blast. We have sex like this all the time.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know whether to kiss you or kill you.”, Kyle commented.<br />
<br />
“You know I get that a lot form some of my favorite sex partners. Get used to it boys, this is what we are. You will do this to many others, and worse. It’s our nature. I was human once. I didn’t ask to be like this, but I would never go back.” Donk sighed mentally and paused a moment to let that sink in.<br />
<br />
“The situation is pretty stark, so I will lay it out for you. You are being hunted right now as we speak. A capture team will arrive soon. They may or may not beat your parents here. If you are here, they will take you. You don’t know enough to defend yourselves against the firepower Ponius can command. He will take you and break you. Your lives will be miserable till he decides you are no longer useful, then you will be disposed of.<br />
With us, you have freedom and a choice. I won’t compel you to come with me. My job is to convince you, not capture or kill.” Donk was on a roll, time to press the argument home. <br />
<br />
“I don’t need to tell you how your parents will react if they get home and see you. I also don’t need to mention what the police and medical authorities will do when they become aware of all the rampaging teenagers with horse cocks. I was there Kyle, I watched you corrupt your friends. That vision of your future ends in a dissection table at worst, permanent quarantine at best. No sex colts. No sex ever after.” Donk could feel the fear beginning to build.<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid we don’t have a lot of time. I don’t know exactly when the opposition will show, but they surely will at soon. Fun as this sexual recharge is, we need to pull out, and you colts need to make a choice. So what’s it going to be colts? I need an answer, and I need it now.”</p>
