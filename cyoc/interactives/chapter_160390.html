<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Connor woke up to sounds coming from his side. What time was it? Looking at the bright window, it was at least morning. He could see Allen standing up, looking disoriented. He probably just woke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, my head hurts&quot; Allen groaned. &quot;Wait Connor is that you. Did you stay with me?<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to look after you. You were completely wasted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry bro. I drank too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Allen, just take some time to relax. I&#39;ll get you some water.<br />
<br />
Connor went down to Yolanda&#39;s kitchen. He had to step over some a couple of guests sleeping in the corridors. From the kitchen, he brought a full mug of water. Once Allen received it, he quickly drank it all. Allen laid back down. Connor stayed with him, looking at the hungover man he loved. After a while of laying down, not speaking a word, Allen said he felt better. The two of them walked to Allen&#39;s home.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can manage now that I am home. Thanks for staying with me bro!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, no problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor left. He had fantasies about taking more care of Allen. Cooking meals to help with his hangover. He could wear just an apron, and Allen would hungrily stare at him. That wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t really happen with Connor being male.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Some days later, Connor walked through the school hallways, getting ready to go home. He saw Josie. They shared a smile, Connor&#39;s smile being somewhat forced. Then he shifted to look in another direction. As Kendall had asked him to do, he was avoiding any incident with Josie or Jenna. The easiest way was to just avoid them outside of polite gestures.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Connor.&quot; Josie had walked right up to him. So much for avoiding her. What did she want with him?<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, hey Josie.&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven&#39;t really talked since we um, changed you back. That&#39;s a while ago now. I just wonder how you&#39;re holding up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am doing fine, really.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s nice to hear.&quot; she smiled. &quot;I&#39;ve observed you a little bit, not observed, looked at you interact with people, and I don&#39;t think you&#39;re actually that bad. Wait, that sounded wrong. I mean, I don&#39;t dislike you now. Jenna still hates you, but her issues with you are more um, personal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. I&#39;m happy we&#39;re settled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you wouldn&#39;t want a girl with a world altering device mad at you.&quot; she joked.<br />
<br />
Josie was here talking to him, and she seemed cordial. Was this his chance? He did want to try some more time as a girl. Could he ask her to change him one more time? Even if she were to refuse, she shouldn&#39;t get angry by him just asking. What did he have to lose?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Josie, is it possible for me to change again?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh. You want that?&quot; She seemed intrigued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Not permanent of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. I&#39;d love to. We owe you one after forcibly changing you, so yeah. Just stay here and wait five minutes and I&#39;ll come back. Do you want the exact change as last time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be the exact. I just want to be a girl again for some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! I&#39;ll do that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josie seemed surprisingly enthusiastic. Still, he got what he wanted. Yet again he was to become a girl. He felt a mix of excitement and fear of what he&#39;d just asked Josie to do. She returned after about ten minutes had passed.<br />
<br />
&quot;There! It&#39;s done.&quot; Josie informed. &quot;Your change will take about two hours. Contact me whenever you&#39;ve had enough! You should go home so you don&#39;t change in public, but I want to hang out with girl-you at least once before you change back. Promise me that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah sure. I promise. See you then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor didn&#39;t particularly care for Josie&#39;s company, but he guess becoming friends with her would come with huge advantages. That would be for a later time. Now he should go home as fast as possible before the changes to his body becomes noticeable to anyone around him.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Connor arrived home. He quickly got undressed to look how much he&#39;d changed so far. He was already looking a little bit feminine. He noted his narrower shoulders, wider hips and his penis, which was noticeably shrunken. One thing that hadn&#39;t changed much, at least compared to the previous time, was his muscles. His muscles were smaller, but they hadn&#39;t shrunk much compared to how his previous change started with his muscles severely diminishing<br />
<br />
Time passed quickly as Connor explored and studied his body, he even masturbated, managing to cum right before his penis shriveled up into his body. As the changes progressed it didn&#39;t look like Connor would be that small or weak. He guessed becoming female wasn&#39;t connected to him being weak or short like he&#39;d been the first time.<br />
<br />
Looking at the time, about two hours had passed since Connor spoke with Josie. The changes should be around complete. Connor looked in the mirror to see the girl she&#39;d had become. She was shorter by a little bit, but still tall for a girl, probably around Kendall&#39;s height. She had a toned body and meaty thighs, looking like a girl who spends a lot of time in the gym. While her previous girl-form looked like somewhat of an opposite of the male Connor, this body was closer to her male self, yet undeniably female. She loved her reflection.<br />
<br />
She was giddy with all the possibilities. She wanted to try out clothes. She remembered back to the pale blue dress she found in her mother&#39;s closet. As a male, She&#39;d tried to wear it, but she hadn&#39;t managed to get it up her body. She rushed to her mother&#39;s wardrobe to grab it. She slid the dress on. It fit perfectly. The neckline showed a tasteful amount of cleavage,  perfectly accommodating her chest. The waistline pinched in and snugly fit around her waist. The dress looked great on her. And her legs, they felt so airy not wearing pants. She did a little twirl. The hem lifted up as she spun. This was so much fun.</p>
