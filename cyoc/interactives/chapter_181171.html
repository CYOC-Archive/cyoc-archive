<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danielle had taken great effort to make her schedule work. She woke up at six every weekday morning and did a two hour workout before her morning class, she’d gone to great lengths to make sure all her classes were before noon. It opened up the afternoon for things she enjoyed like cycling, surfing, and martial arts.<br />
<br />
When she’d been a kid she’d been rather chubby and had gone to great lengths to make her body as hot as it was now. She had gorgeous abs, beautiful muscles, and an athletic physique that made her girlfriend Frankie go totally nuts and turn into a pool of giggling blushing. Danielle was looking forward to an afternoon punching a sandbag in the gym downstairs and an evening on the beach getting some sun on her skin, but first came lunch, and she was looking forward to it.<br />
<br />
She’d gotten into cooking when working on her weight, trying out new recipes to help build muscles and nourish her active lifestyle. By that point in her life she was a damn good chef and the meal she’d cooked last night was all she’d been thinking of all morning.<br />
<br />
She burst into the apartment with her headphones blaring her workout tunes and tossed her bag on the couch, not even registering that much of the furniture in the apartment had changed over the weekend. The plants had changed too, a Venus fly trap growing in size, the flowers growing up and outwards with mushrooms and little blue fireflies floating around them, and various pots appearing filled with root vegetables and other witchy plants. Danielle opened the fridge and frowned upon gazing into the interior.<br />
<br />
Donna had bought a bunch of weird food over the weekend, probably from some health kick she was on. She did that from time to time, getting so into the guy she was sucking off that she’d start to adopt his eating habits. All sorts of white carrots, jars of green jelly, and containers of who knows what occupied nearly half the fridge.<br />
<br />
“KEEP IT TO YOUR SIDE!” Danielle shouted while pulling her headphones out of her ears and starting to dig. “Where is... WHERE IS MY CHICKEN?! Ugh! That bitch ate it didn’t she!”<br />
<br />
She slammed the fridge shut and poured for about five minutes, wishing Donna would exit her room so they could fight. Donna was busy pouring over books or whatever so Danielle just sighed and gave up. If her roommate was going to eat her food, then fine, she was going to return the favour.<br />
<br />
White carrots were chopped revealing their blue streaked innards, a container of ground something or other was emptied, Donna’s spice racks were invaded, and she used her roommates dumb oversized pots to scramble eggs and side them with a garlic weird vegetable medley and chunks of meat that smelled kind of like pork. She couldn’t be sure but it sure tasted like that.<br />
<br />
She ate with a temper, enjoying every bite of her stolen food and glaring at Donna’s bedroom door with a gargantuan scowl. Donna stayed cooped up inside though so Danielle just wandered downstairs to her workout.<br />
<br />
She imagined Donna’s face on that sandbag as she bashed her fists into it, rapid fire strikes and kicks ploughing into the thing from her taped up hands and feet. One rep, two reps, three reps, four. She had boundless fury and energy to spare, and she wasn’t even getting tired.<br />
<br />
She didn’t realize something was up until she punched the sandbag so hard it came off the hinges and burst open. She was left standing there stunned staring at what she’d just done while a rumble filled her stomach.<br />
<br />
“What in the world?” She asked while looking down.<br />
<br />
She started to grow, she’d been about five foot five for a few years but suddenly her entire body was being wracked with growing pains shooting through her arms and legs. She rose in height, crossing six feet and halting around six foot two. Her shoulders then swelled outwards while her arms and legs thickened with muscle. Her waist caved in more than it was already and lined with even more muscles than before.<br />
<br />
“What is happening?” She demanded while her figure turned into a new womanly form. She was so strong looking with all sorts of powerful curves, rock hard abs and a strength below her skin. Her clothing shifted, stretching to accommodate her new size and curvature. She coughed and her voice was suddenly so sexy and deep it made her vagina tingle, turned on by her own deep sensual voice.<br />
<br />
“I feel powerful,” she grinned while her tattoos rearranged on her left arm, changing from simple shapes to power runes, she clenched her left arm and it seemed to pulse with power, a glowing aura surrounding it. “I love it!”<br />
<br />
She then proceeded with her workout and it was so effortless, she did a hundred pushups without breaking a sweat, turned herself on while doing squats in front of the mirror, and tied her longer blonde hair back feeling it shave down along the sides freeing up her ears. Power runes glowed over her body, concentrated on her left arm and if she focused she could spread it through her body making her feet even strong.<br />
<br />
She was a giggling mess when she got upstairs, sliding into the apartment and stomping over to her room. She had to bend down to fit in the door and that made her grin like an idiot.<br />
<br />
Her eyes lit up when she gazed at what her bedroom had become. The floor space was clear with pillows and mats for sitting, there were several books on a low bookshelf that looked important and old with gold binding, she had banners around her walls, a stuffed animal dragon on her soft bedsheets, and looking above it all was a rack of weapons. Swords, shields, spears, knives, and in the center, a set of armour sized for her with beautiful fabrics coloured a pale silver and plates made of interlocked iron. It seemed to glow with power and gave off a faint light as if her room was being lit by moonlight.<br />
<br />
“Is that... mine?” She asked with a gasp before slowly approaching. Her fingers touched the armour and she knew at that moment it was hers. She didn’t waste any time, she pulled it off the wall and slid the fabrics and plates of armour on, it felt right on her skin, and her entire body shuddered and she stood before a full length mirror decorated in that beautiful outfit. She felt whole with it on and grinned from ear to ear feeing beautiful, powerful, and ready for action.</p>
