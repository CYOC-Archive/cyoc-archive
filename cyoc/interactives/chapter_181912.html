<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Earlier that morning....<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Kyle hung up the phone after cursing Jen. He was a giddy as he could be. He knew his curse had worked. He could hear the fear in Jen&#39;s voice. Jen had a grew a 3-foot-long, horse cock and he was the one responsible. Kyle was as hard as diamond. <br />
<br />
Kyle slid into the bathroom.  He was about to start masterbating when his mother called for him. It was time to go to school. Release could wait. Kyle spent the rest of the morning imagining the look on Jen&#39;s face the moment she grew a penis.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Kyle stepped out of his mother&#39;s car onto the school grounds. He was shocked, amazed, and aroused by what he saw. Every woman he saw was sporting a 3-foot dick. This must be Jen&#39;s doing.<br />
<br />
Some girls had tucked their meat tucked between their breasts. Others just let it all hang loose. The girls that did wore special socks and stockings around their penis. Both to protect their decency and to keep out the cold.<br />
<br />
As his mom&#39;s car drove away, Kyle wondered if she had a stick, too. He could not see her as she had left so he could not empirically confirm his hunch. But, his own altered memories gave him his answer.<br />
<br />
As Kyle walked into the school, he was at rapture&#39;s door. He was living out his personal fantasy and Jen was- unintentionally- playing along. His dick was so hard. It felt as big as the women around him. He had to catch a break. But, class was starting soon.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Going to class first was a bad idea. He could barely focus on a word Mr. Thomas said. At least his teacher was male and didn&#39;t have a massive, fifth limb hanging from his crotch to detract him further. But, that didn&#39;t stop his eyes from wondering to the female students around him.<br />
<br />
After Mr. Thomas had finished his morning lecture, Kyle asked if he could be excused to the bathroom. Mr. Thomas complied. Kyle sprang up and flew to the nearest bathroom to relieve himself. <br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Kyle gasped for air. That was the hardest he ever came in his life. He was on cloud nine. He sat in the bathroom stall until the bell rang.<br />
<br />
Then, something changed. He felt... different. Old memories clashed with the new. It was difficult to parse what was real and what was a lie. Kyle looked around himself. Then, he looked down and saw the changes. <br />
<br />
He had boobs. Lots of them. 6 breasts to call his own marched down his chest in pair. Instinctively curious, Kyle gave his new breasts a soft squeeze. But, that wasn&#39;t what shocked Kyle the most. Hanging between his legs was his own, 3-foot-long penis. However, the strangeness didn&#39;t end with just that. Instead of a normal dick-head, his penis ended with another&#39;s, human head. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the-&quot; Kyle&#39;s penis groaned. It could speak! &quot;Why do I feel so tired...? What is happening?!&quot; The shunken head at the end of his penis rotated 180° and stared up at Kyle. Unable to give the head a solid answer, Kyle screamed and his dick did too.<br />
<br />
After taking a moment to calm down, Kyle searched his mind for answers. His dick-head had a name. Its name was Molly. Kyle remembered Molly the way she used to be. She was a geeky gamer. She liked watching anime and was a big Legend of Zelda fan. Kyle had a crush on her. She was one of the only girls at school that was in his league. Now, she was his penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...?&quot; Molly mumbled. The words bearly making it out of her mouth. &quot;Why am I a dick?&quot; Molly asked, tears rolled down her cheeks and onto her shaft. Kyle felt pity on her. Kyle had inadvertently released a reality-altering God upon the world and he was now its victim. <br />
<br />
Kyle gently wrapped his arm around Molly&#39;s shaft-body and pulled her close to his 6-boobed bosom. &quot;Shh-shh. It&#39;s going to be okay,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. But it&#39;s going to be okay.&quot; Kyle half-lied.<br />
<br />
Kyle pondered to himself as he softly brushed Molly&#39;s hair. The only people that were supposed to remember the world as it changed was Jen and himself. That does not explain why Molly remembered her life before she was his dick. Perhaps, she remembers because she is a part of him? That is as good of a theory as any.<br />
<br />
Kyle stood up and dressed himself. He noted the holes in his jeans that his Molly-dick was meant to fit through. He also found a bizarre sleeve that had appeared. It was like the cock-socks that the woman wore to cover their junk. As he slipped it on, Kyle noticed a pouch attached to one end. It was designed to hold Molly&#39;s breast-balls. It even had a cute, little window to show off her breast-ball cleavage.<br />
<br />
Breast-balls. Kyle chuckled to himself. He had hardly even noticed them before. He felt like had always them. But, he didn&#39;t. Kyle gave one a little squeeze. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmph-! Stop that....&quot; Molly moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I&#39;m just trying to figure things out,&quot; Kyle said, pulling his hand away. &quot;Do you feel like your old memories have been mixed with new ones?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s exactly how I feel,&quot; Molly responded. &quot;It&#39;s like I have always been your penis. But, I know I&#39;m not. I feel so... conflicted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do, too,&quot; Kyle agreed. He was feeling conflicted, too. He found it to be hot-as-hell that his crush was now- literally- on his dick. But, it didn&#39;t want it to be like this. <br />
<br />
Kyle brought Molly closer. He lifted up his shirt and tucked Molly between his breasts. Molly grunted and squirmed as she was squished in between Kyle&#39;s 6 boobs. Molly&#39;s weak sounds only aroused Kyle. Thus, erecting Molly&#39;d dick-body, causing her to squirm more, causing Kyle to become more aroused, and completeing a cycle or escalate heat. Eventually, the cycle of arousal leveled off and Kyle was able to refocus. It felt nice. Not just having a yard-long dick, but also having somebody else so close to him.<br />
<br />
Kyle exited the stall. He saw his reflection in the bathroom mirror. Kyle was greeted by a stranger. His face barely resembled his former self. His hair was longer. His cheekbones were softer. Just below Kyle&#39;s rounded chin, sat Molly&#39;s shrunken head. It poked out from underneath his shirt.<br />
<br />
Kyle searched his memories and discovered that males like he had been don&#39;t exist anymore. He wasn&#39;t a &#39;he&#39; and never had been. Kyle was fully female despite the 36-incher under his shirt. &#39;He&#39; has a &#39;she&#39; and SHE was okay with that. Because she always had been.<br />
<br />
Breaking her train of thought, another stall door opened. She turned to see none other than Jennifer Smith. Jen was in the same situation she was: six boobs; a sentient, talking dick-head; and existential dread.<br />
<br />
They stared at each other. Jen and Kyle knew what the other was capable. Potential, leading questions raced through Kyle&#39;s mind. Potential counters raced through Jen&#39;s. It was a Mexican standoff.</p>
