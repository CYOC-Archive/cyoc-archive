<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Douglas left in the morning; Joan noticed he forgot to make himself a lunch or even fix himself a breakfast. So while Darrell was watching television; the were-tigress was busy making a rather large corned beef sandwich with lettuce, onions, tomatoes and Dijon mustard with pickles. Packing the sandwich with a bottle of juice and an piece of fruit; Joan takes the remote she had on the kitchen island and uses it to turn of the television.<br />
“Turn it back on,” Darrell shouting; “I was watching that.”<br />
“Not anymore,” Joan looking at Darrell; “we are going to get your uncle some lunch in him. So get your shoes on kiddo.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper sat in his office; after Frederick Parker left along with his sketchy lawyer, Sheriff Cooper had Daniel Parker led back to his cell. Meanwhile Agent Brooke Reed was busy talking to the men of Parker that were arrested in the past twenty four hours; trying to get them to turn on his boss without revealing that the one fear they had, Chelnik Valdomir was dead. Having to kill the man herself and conferring and agreeing with the sheriff to make it look like the ex Spetsnaz was killed by a rival of Freddie’s; it made trying to flip the men to testify in Frederick Parker’s R.I.C.O case.<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper knew Frederick was planning something; ever since the man came to town with the dozen of lawyers trying to get Daniel Parker out of jail; the sheriff has been at wits end trying to figure it out. While he was a were and could of easily used his acute hearing to listen in on Freddie and his son talking; the fact that their lawyer was present, made it clear that he had to at least follow the law to the letter, despite his superior senses.<br />
“At least I can assign deputies to keep a discreet eye and ear on you Freddie,” Sheriff Cooper sighing as he took an aspirin.<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper looks up as there is a knock on his door. Seeing it open and Joan standing there along with Darrell; Sheriff Cooper smiled as they entered his office.<br />
“Well this is a nice surprise,” Douglas getting up.<br />
“When you didn’t come home for lunch,” Joan speaking; “I decide to bring lunch to you.”<br />
“And Darrell he probably wants to watch more Hanna Barbara,” Sheriff Cooper lifting the kid up effortlessly with one hand; “after lunch you want a tour of the station? See what your uncle does for a living?”<br />
“Yeah,” Darrell happy shouts; “do you have any bad men locked up?”<br />
“I do actually,” Sheriff Cooper putting the young were-mer down; “yet we won’t be visiting that part of the jail. Some of them are a rather nasty lot that committed some serious crimes;” Sheriff Cooper was referring to the men that Frederick Parker lost from trespassing onto Talbot property and the hospital as well as the lone survivor of a failed home invasion at the Knight residence. Lastly was the man that shot Peter Talbot; Daniel Parker who was arrested after crashing the ’66 Mustang while trying to elude the state police.<br />
“Are they the ones that hurt mommy fish,” Darrell referring to his now dead mother Alyssa Cooper.<br />
“No,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “these are men from San Francisco that decide to raise a ruckus in this town. The bad men that took you mother away from us,” Sheriff Cooper sighing; “are by now in a secret prison for weres. Even I don’t know its location.”<br />
“Will they be their forever,” Darrell asking; “will mommy fish’s killers ever get out?”<br />
“No,” Sheriff Cooper looking at his cousin’s son; “murder is a serious crime here in town. Just as serious as committing Statue 1A.”<br />
“What is Statue 1A,” Darrell asking.<br />
“It’s a crime in which a were forcibly turns a normal against their will. A crime that faces a mandatory minimum fifty year sentence upon conviction,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “we are the only town that has such a unique law because of our unique population. There are other were-communities that are out there that have similar laws in place, Sheriff Cooper looking at Darrell; “yet Moon Lake is the largest and the most organized of them all.”<br />
“So this town is like were-capital of the world,” Joan speaking up.<br />
“In a sense yes,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “however our elder council has very limited power or influence outside of the town. Now enough of that,” Sheriff looking at the bag Joan is holding; “let’s see what’s for lunch.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Leon was talking to his pride members after he and Regina arrived back home from the hospital; unable to sit around while their son who was gravely wounded rutted and unknowingly form a loving relationship with his were-rabbit doctor Helen Tompkins, they arrive home to gather everyone around for a meeting. Getting word from his allies and friends; Leon found out that Frederick was kicked out of the lone motel in Moon Lake. Unable to suppress a hearty laugh at what Benton was doing to the man, Leon felt that it gave him the perfect opportunity to attack without damaging Knight property.<br />
‘Last thing I want to do is piss off that surly were-panther,’ Leon thinking to himself.<br />
<br />
“If the men decide to set up camp at one of the many camp grounds currently open,” Leon speaking; “then attack when they have bedded down and have been asleep for at least two hours. Do not scratch or bite any of the men; we don’t want mobsters becoming weres and dealing with another statue 1A trial.”<br />
“Do we kill,” one of Leon’s brothers speaking up.<br />
“Let Frederick live,” Leon answering; “the rest of his men… just make sure you stay quiet until the deed is done. Then wake him up with howls and roars. Let him see his men around him dead.”<br />
“I want that man running for the hills terrified for his life,” Regina growling; “so scared that he will abandon his son to his legal fate.”<br />
“All right you have your orders,” Leon looking at his nephews and brothers; “Regina wants Frederick Parker to hurt and hurt bad. Normally I would abide by Tachibana’s orders; however, Tachibana is not my wife or your queen.”<br />
<br />
Members of Leon’s large family nod and quickly disperse from the household hold. Leon looks at his wife and gives her silent nod. However the only member of his family not to leave was Eugene; Leon’s nephew and state trooper approaches his uncle.<br />
“King Uncle,” Eugene speaking; “normally I wouldn’t speak up in regards to your orders, but in this case I must do so.”<br />
“Is it because you are a state trooper,” Leon responding; looking at his nephew.<br />
“Yeah,” Eugene answering; “you just ordered my uncles, hell my father to commit murder! All because Aunt Regina said so.”<br />
“You don’t need to be involved,” Leon responding; “in fact I was hoping you wouldn’t be here. That you were patrolling the highways.”<br />
“Even I get days off,” Eugene answers; “you know I have to report this to the sheriff. I am required by law despite being off duty”; Eugene assuming a defensive stance as Leon approaches him.<br />
“Leon don’t,” Regina holding her husband back; “Eugene is family.”<br />
“I told you there was going to be blood,” Leon growling; “I did warn you Regina.”<br />
“Not like this,” Regina growling; “you will not harm Eugene. Parker&#39;s men is one thing; but our family...”<br />
“Call it off King Uncle,” Eugene growling; “because I will tell on you.”<br />
<br />
Leon looks at Eugene; seeing his nephew not backing down and his wife looking at him pleadingly, Leon growls as he gets on his phone; yet refusing to yield and show weakness to the pride he calls but only to alter the plan.<br />
“Its me,” Leon speaking; “change of plans. No one dies and no roaring or howling. Instead I want you to abduct Frederick’s men and transport them someplace that will ensure they can’t get back to Moon Lake. Strip them of their clothing as well as their possessions and let them wander about naked as a jay bird. If you can drop them off across the U.S-Canadian border, then do it. Other than that make sure they are in a wooded area and thoroughly lost.<br />
<br />
Leon hangs up the phone and glares that his Nephew; “nature will deal with the men, or do you still intend to betray your king?”<br />
“I won’t tell on you King Uncle,” Eugene looking at his uncle; “but I refuse to be a part of this. I hope for your sake that this will be the last of your feud with the Parkers, because I will not hold back from doing my duty as an officer of the law the next time something happens.”  <br />
“Never threaten me again Eugene,” Leon growling; “now get out of my house.”<br />
“Gladly,” Eugene responding; “give my best to Peter. I hope he makes a speedy recovery.”</p>
