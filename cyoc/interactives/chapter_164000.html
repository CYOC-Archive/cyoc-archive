<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That next morning, Saturday morning, Deion awoke at the party house and noted that it seemed Savannah was already up and out. He didn&#39;t blame her, he&#39;d massively overslept, considering it was like 11:30. He stretched and thought about everything he&#39;d considered the previous night. Safe to say after that he would not mind it if Alec never returned. As challenging as this new life could be, he was still capable of all the same things, and he had a hell of a relationship to go with his new life. Deion got up and dressed himself, noting that his clothes were somewhat tighter than usual. He wondered if there was one more burst of a growing spurt there, and if it was the case, he hoped Savannah got to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
So, he&#39;d won the big game yesterday, he&#39;d won the girl&#39;s love, and he&#39;d set up his course to his future. He was just going to totally acclimate to it, and just go with being Deion from here on out. Much as he had to worry about with this, what with his parents being due in a few weeks, he could handle that issue and still live reasonably comfortably. Set himself up for future successes and even a career in the NFL if this football thing went the way he hoped it would.<br />
<br />
As Deion headed out to go get some food at a local cafe for a late breakfast, the waitress who welcomed him in was remarkably less than shy about checking him out, and even congratulated him on his win. She was cute, not as hot as Savannah, but cute. He said, &quot;Always glad to have a fan around.&quot; He winked and watched her run off with his order: an ice coffee, a chicken sandwich, and salad. He tried for the healthy stuff as usual.<br />
<br />
Once Deion got his ice coffee, he found his phone seemed to be ringing. Checking it to see it was Dave&#39;s number, he wondered what might be bringing this on. He certainly hoped it wasn&#39;t begging for a hook up or something.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, on the other end was a rather shaken Dave, who seemed to be dealing with something, &quot;Dude, you were absolutely right. I-I can&#39;t believe it myself, but I&#39;m...I&#39;m changing. Like, into a fucking black guy. Like you said. I can&#39;t believe---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s cuz...&quot; Deion started, shaking his head a little, &quot;You got all wound up with your hormones and sexual obsessions. You made your bed, man. Now you gotta sleep in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, dude!&quot; Dave asked, &quot;Haven&#39;t you...didn&#39;t you tell me to try and talk to you about this? I&#39;m trying, man! I don&#39;t want this. Isn&#39;t there some way to, to turn me back!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Deion shook his head, thinking back to those books, wondering if any of them were even good for anything. Deion didn&#39;t even know what changed him in the first place, what those street guys did to him. &quot;Well, I&#39;ve got some books on the subject, and I don&#39;t got any use for &#39;em.  If you want em, you can come over tomorrow and get &#39;em. Just...my advice? If you don&#39;t wanna change no more, don&#39;t spank it, don&#39;t hook up, stay at home and keep your clothes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Seriously!?&quot; Deion winced when Dave shouted into the phone, &quot;I-I can&#39;t go without it! Do you know how insane my libido is now? I&#39;d go crazy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you better work something out, man,&quot; Deion responded, and then said, &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow for those books. Bye.&quot; And with that, he ended the call and closed up his phone just in time for the order to get there. He smiled at the waitress and thanked her for the drink and food.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
As day turned into night, Deion got another call, and he hoped it wasn&#39;t yet more hysterics from Dave. Instead however it was a call from Savannah, asking him out on the town to go to an eighteen and under rap dance club called Town Lights. He&#39;d heard of that place, and apparently it was a place for up and coming rap acts to go and try out their material. Surprisingly good ones at that. He quickly said yes, and started to get his outfit ready for the night on the town.<br />
<br />
He headed upstairs and started getting his stuff together, eagerly showering and making sure he was nice and taken care of for the sake of his and Savannah&#39;s night out. He made sure to use his deo and various shampoos in the shower, he didn&#39;t want to smell like sweat and the bed from last night when he went out with his new girlfriend. And he wasn&#39;t exactly surprised he was thinking of her in more near and dear terms to his heart.<br />
<br />
So, by the time nine o&#39;clock came around, Deion was showered, dressed for success in the club, and already thinking about possibly getting some more action that night.<br />
<br />
It was thankfully not a long walk to get there, especially with Deion wearing a tight black dress shirt, leather pants, and his best dancing shoes. He met Savannah out front, and was brought in with his lady friend quickly. The club was a loud and brash, banging atmosphere, mostly black attendees though there were the odd white goers here, most likely trying to convince themselves they were more Eminem than Vanilla Ice.<br />
<br />
Savannah brought him into a kiss as the music turned more active around them, &quot;You liking the place so far? I&#39;ve always wanted to go here with someone. Especially a man like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww,&quot; Deion said with a smirk, &quot;You&#39;re flattering me. I love it, the music&#39;s really good, and I love the atmosphere already.&quot; He went ahead over to the bar, and ordered some drinks. The bartender got a rather odd smile on his face and seemed to take a distinct message from it. Muttering something along the lines of &quot;drinks for the champion and his girl&quot;, he started brewing something together.<br />
<br />
Wait, Deion wondered, is he using alcohol in this stuff?<br />
<br />
Even though Deion liked to consider himself more free than Alec had ever been, he still wasn&#39;t entirely on board with drinking actual alcohol. But by the time the drinks got out there, Savannah didn&#39;t seem affected by her drink, and so Deion decided to go with it. The drink was as bitter as alcohol ever was, but it had a very sweet kick to it that almost knocked him off his feet.<br />
<br />
Still, he handled it better than most people who&#39;d never had such a stiff drink would&#39;ve, in part due to his size.<br />
<br />
Savannah brought him into a lively, thrumming dance floor, and he decided to dance his worries away in the heat of the rap song going on. He was feeling kind of dizzy as the song entered its halfway point, but he just told himself he needed to work it off. No way a man as masculine as Deion was gonna be floored by some drink!<br />
<br />
Before long, Deion&#39;s shirt was pulled open, and his girl was rubbing her hands on his abs and feeling his pecs. He groaned and wavered again on his feet. Even though he was feeling odd and distinctly uneven on his feet, his dick had never been harder. Just her hands on him seemed to be spurring him forward. In fact, it kind of felt in the midst of the floor like everyone was touching him in just the right way. He felt someone get a little frisky with his ass, and as he and Savannah danced, he couldn&#39;t tell if that was her touching his dick or not.<br />
<br />
The images of the people on the dance floor around him all seemed to blur together like a wall of ink, swelling and swirling into a moirass of colors and shapes and gripping, groping hands. He felt people grip him, touch him, shout his name, and he knew he could never let go of the fame of being the winning player Deion Dalton.<br />
<br />
The hours went on and the drinks flowed, and Deion didn&#39;t know which ones were just sodapop and which were flowing with that only barely diluted booze. They could get in serious trouble doing this for him, he realized, but right now he was having way too much fun for this to bother him.<br />
<br />
By the time it was all done, Deion and Savannah headed nearby his place, the black elite athlete feeling uneven on his feet, but capable of walking even still. He was drunk, but he wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly drunk. He was dimly aware of Savannah commenting something like &quot;Damn, living around here? You&#39;re either from money, or you work for it. Nice!&quot; He didn&#39;t even remember when she left to go home herself, just that Deion was heading indoors distinctly sloppy and barely aware from tiredness and his drunken state.<br />
<br />
He looked around his empty house, the lights all off. He was barely able to tell where anything was. He made sure the door was locked - he wasn&#39;t dumb drunk - and he outright stripped naked then and there, chuckling and flexing. &quot;Ohh yeah...look at me, look at all this. I could never let it go...&quot; <br />
<br />
He stumbled around after trying to do a lunge and double bicep, accidentally kicking one of the books he&#39;d ordered on magic and such. He&#39;d never even opened it, not thinking it was anything worth looking into... And then he heard something that started to raise some specter of awareness in him. His eyes caught a glimpse of some sort of green spark in the air. A distant energetic burst...<br />
<br />
...And there it was again. And again! He looked around, trying to find where the only light in the whole damn house at this point was. &quot;Where...what the...?&quot; He looked down and saw it was the book. Crackle, crackle, spark, and then the sound of a great and terrible lightning crash! Deion fell backward on his ass as the book seemed to start flipping through its pages on its own, page after page emitting more and more sparks and strange scientific looking diagrams just as well.<br />
<br />
When he let out a shout of surprise and fright at the sight of this, it seemed to make the displays and blasts of energy more common. As if noise was feeding into it.<br />
<br />
And then it exploded outward from the book, and all Deion was able to see was green light around himself. And from the outside of the house, all the lights inside turned on at once, the huge and generous many story house / mansion lighting up in the dead of night as if it was the midst of the day. And then all the lights, one by one, slowly went out again.<br />
<br />
Inside the house, Deion laid there sprawled out on the middle of the floor, in front of a book full of empty pages. Smoke rose up from the pages in a heady cloud smelling of sweet nectar and arsenic. He stirred a bit, but then fell to sleep then and there on the floor of the living room, none the wiser.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t even see, as he went off to sleep, that his skin, once the hue of deep milk chocolate, had now turned to white, being peachy colored, very lightly tanned, and even across his body. His hair - still in its cornrow look - now bright golden blond again. His lips slim and lighter again, his nose sharper and narrower . Blue eyes clenched tight in sleep. Despite the many changes, his body remained as heavily muscled and enormous as it had become prior. <br />
<br />
By all appearances, Deion had become Alec - even, no, especially since he had gotten so acclimated. And what that meant for him now was anyone&#39;s guess.</p>
