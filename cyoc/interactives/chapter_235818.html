<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It felt good to finally have some privacy. <br />
Jess and your Uncle Jack had taken the evening off, they mysteriously said they had to go do something and wouldn&#39;t be back until sunrise. You weren&#39;t sure what, probably some magic shit, go make a blood sacrifice under the moon or something. <br />
<br />
Seemed like a good time to try and pull off your costumes. You sat in the bathroom; your skin suit down to your ankles. It was just flopped around your feet like an awkward jumpsuit. And you were blushing and... wet... <br />
Try as you might, the more you wiggled your cat tail around, tugging and pulling at it, the more it just felt like a metal plug was rolling around and rubbing the sides of your vagina. Currently you were a layer down, female, maid costume, cat ears, and your male suit was stuck around the Mary Jane style shoes that wouldn&#39;t come off of you. <br />
<br />
You were red in the face and sweaty as if you&#39;d been masturbating but you hadn&#39;t exactly been.. intentionally doing so. Well until now... <br />
Biting your lip you peeked down to your crotch to look at your girl cunt. Musky and wet. You slipped fingers between, getting a feel for it. Finally able to unleash some inhibitions now that you were home alone. Your stomach felt knotted as you did so. <br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t ... right... <br />
Still... it felt like you had a dildo firmly planted in you, but as your fingers went to explore they found nothing in there. Pushing past your urethra to a slippery hole. You throbbed, heart beating hard down there, and you bit your thumb troubled. <br />
Then stood up abruptly and pulled your male suit on insecurely. <br />
<br />
Well. <br />
&quot;Male&quot; suit. <br />
As your eyes readjusted to your skin settling back on, you really looked practically like a girl. Just short hair, some minor make up, and plush lips stained with a magical cerise lipstick. <br />
What had been girlish throbbing in your cunt still thrummed somewhere deep inside, but now was transferred to your micropenis. <br />
You lifted your petticoats to your lacy underwear and could see your dick pushing excitedly against the fabric. <br />
<br />
You pulled your underwear down to look at it in the mirror. Your balls had remained soft full and about the size of plums, unwrinkled but blushed for some reason. <br />
Your dick had significantly shrunk. It looked like a fucking cocktail wiener. <br />
But damn if he wasn&#39;t excited. You could still feel it was all... you could still feel something inside you shifting around with your weight. <br />
Ugh how big was it? Like an inch or so... <br />
You gingerly went to hold it, it feeling so sensitive.<br />
<br />
Oh. <br />
Too!<br />
Sensitive!<br />
You barely squeezed the base when you felt a drop in your stomach and that rush. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; you grabbed the sides of the sink as you came. Trembling. Dick excited as all get out. <br />
Fuck. <br />
You rubbed the base of it, biting your lip, still feeling oh so sensitive. <br />
Had it gotten more sensitive at this size? You weren&#39;t sure. As you grabbed toilet paper to clean up. Flushed and washed your hands. <br />
<br />
Nng. You were still horny. Still, you pulled your satin undies back up trying not to think too hard about how nice the fabric felt on your little guy. <br />
You grabbed a spellbook from the shelf and walked down the costume shop. Leaving the lights off as your cat eyes gave you a minor perk of seeing in the dark. Waltzing into the beaded section. <br />
Tonight you had a plan. <br />
<br />
Looking through the magic sexy section you picked out what you wanted. A nude colored strap on with the words &quot;The Embiggenator&quot; written on the side. <br />
This thing HAD to give you your length back. <br />
It was 3 something AM, and you knew the shoes were going to be allowed to come off soon. Should you wait before or after to try it on?<br />
<br />
You pushed at the edge of your shoes with your other foot and got your answer as it popped off. <br />
Excitedly you stepped out and stumbled into your old height. There was a flutter as your petticoat disappeared, and some bows on your outfit flitted away with magic. <br />
Finally you were free of those damn sissy shoes. <br />
<br />
You leaned down to grab them and set them back on the shelf when you noticed something. <br />
Huh... Your nails. <br />
The shoes had given you an acrylic manicure of French Tips, they should have been removed when the shoes came off but they were ... sticking?<br />
Well maybe you could fix that later. Though it was concerning that you seemed to have residual magic. Maybe it was from the amount of layers you were wearing. <br />
<br />
Curious you went to the back warehouse bathroom and turned on the light. <br />
You still had little bows around your ears. <br />
Concerning. <br />
Trying to untie them you found it pulled at your scalp again as if growing out of your hair. <br />
You bit your lip with a fang. <br />
Definitely residual magic. <br />
<br />
Well. <br />
That could wait. Right now you were excited to get your dick back. <br />
Hopefully your shrinkage hadn&#39;t stuck around. <br />
<br />
Even though you were alone in the building you still turned around and locked the door. The slid against the wall and sat down on the floor, taking a deep breath. <br />
You pulled your underwear down. <br />
<br />
Fuck.<br />
Little cocktail wiener! <br />
You still had a fucking tiny dick.<br />
Maybe it had grown..? <br />
You spotted a retractable measuring tape on top of some dusty cardboard boxes and a toolkit in the backroom&#39;s bathroom. And moved it out. <br />
Two... two inches. Crap. <br />
<br />
You compared to the strap on you had grabbed. The nude dildo wasn&#39;t especially big despite it&#39;s name. Well you weren&#39;t really sure what was big for girls, but pulling the tape out it was only 5.5 inches, not counting the fake silicon balls. <br />
Still that was better than what you were now. <br />
<br />
Throbbing. <br />
Ugh it was like thinking about having a bigger dick was making yours excited, but it didn&#39;t seem to want to grow anymore than it did. <br />
&quot;Please make me bigger...&quot; You whispered as you hoisted the strap on around your legs. <br />
<br />
You had to kick off your underwear first, the strap on itself was like a jockstrap. The main reason you had hope was there was a hole in the middle like it was hollow. You assumed, with that hole and it&#39;s name you were meant to stick it in. <br />
<br />
So you did. Pushing it firmly down around your little ween. <br />
<br />
First you felt silly. You were sitting in the backroom bathroom of your Uncle&#39;s Costume shop with a strap on around your dick, with cat ears, manicured nails and a black frilly dress. <br />
But then the suction started. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; You gasped, it feeling like someone was giving you a super firm blowie. You kicked your legs out as your whole crotch tingled. It was getting stronger and stronger. <br />
&quot;Nng!&quot; You were trying to resist, but you couldn&#39;t help but buck a little, heaving forward to all fours, holding your crotch. It was beginning to get a little painful. It was less like someone was sucking you and more like someone put a vacuum around you. <br />
<br />
But then the heat came. You felt around the belt of the strap on and could feel it actively sinking into your skin. Feeling with your nails, it suddenly disappeared into you, as if your own skin was beginning to cover it. <br />
Slowly. <br />
Slowly. <br />
You felt around, feeling dull plastic that began to gain nerves and senses... <br />
You felt your own balls, then the plastic balls. Crap was it going to give you four balls?<br />
<br />
For a minute it did. And you whimpered, feeling your natural balls, then suddenly a second set? <br />
Both ... so ... sensitive... <br />
You squeezed them together and felt a pop. Whimpering again, you reached around mostly feeling. One set. <br />
Your old set had absorbed the new ones. And... <br />
<br />
Oh was that going to be a problem? What had been more lemons was quickly becoming more of an orange size. <br />
Then... crap.<br />
They were growing. <br />
Holding your balls in your hand, squeezing as if trying to contain them, you felt them swell. And swell. Into firm grapefruit size. Not together, but two separate grapefruits. Oh and they were sensitive. You squeezed and whimpered more. Heat throbbing up your base. <br />
<br />
Oh it was happening. You could feel it. Your tiny dick becoming one with the Embiggenator. <br />
You moved your hand up your shaft, as the plastic became smooth and warm. <br />
<br />
You shuddered at how good it felt, stroking. And stroking. <br />
Before you new it you were jacking off on your hands and knees. <br />
But it felt... good. It felt like your old dick only better. <br />
Stronger. Smoother. Sensitive. <br />
Sweating you reached back to see how your balls were doing. And squeezed. <br />
<br />
You yelped as you came on the ground, eyes crossing. <br />
Huffing and enjoying the post nut glow. <br />
You sat back down and went to admire your new asset. <br />
<br />
Your balls were... definitely big.<br />
Like go get checked for testicular cancer big. Ugh and they felt... like they had a pressure within. You poked them, they felt ...taunt. Too taunt to be regular balls. <br />
<br />
But the star of the show was your new dick. Still brandishing the words &quot;The Embiggenator&quot; on the side like you had gotten a tattoo you were finally back to a reasonable size. <br />
<br />
You grabbed for the measuring tape and checked your length. 6.5 inches. <br />
Huh. Longer than the strap on was outside your body. <br />
But it was seamless. There was no indication that you were wearing something fake. It looked and felt like your own body. <br />
Curious you pulled the stiff tape across your balls. <br />
<br />
6 inches. Ball to ball. <br />
You pushed a finger around to feel the testicle inside, but it felt... firm like a water balloon. <br />
Ugh firm and sensitive. <br />
But you could... probably live with that. <br />
<br />
You leaned back smiling. Finally happy with your size. <br />
<br />
Then felt a pulse. <br />
<br />
It felt like electricity pushing through your balls. <br />
You saw them swell, actively, as if filling up. The tape still on top of them you saw as they pushed into 7 inches across. <br />
Oh maybe... the transformation wasn&#39;t over? Even though... You came. <br />
<br />
You looked a the little area that looked like you&#39;d hocked a loogey on the ground. <br />
Suddenly it felt like ice ran through your dick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; you kicked, it twitched and went off again. <br />
<br />
You jumped as your dick blew, and you felt a second orgasm. No lead up, just sudden surprise. <br />
&quot;Ah... ahhaha what?&quot; you laughed, grabbing it. <br />
You&#39;d gone off straight in the air like a fountain. <br />
<br />
Your stomach turned a little, it was nice but... unexpected. <br />
You began to stand up. <br />
<br />
Then suddenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; you grabbed yourself, and felt yourself shoot another shot into your hands. Your legs were shaking, you stumbled over to the toilet. <br />
Shivering. <br />
Dick. Throbbing. <br />
No, pounding. <br />
Pounding so hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;W-what&#39;s.. AH!&quot; you felt another load, as you squeezed your dick, you felt a pressure in your grip. Your knees knocked and buckled together as you sat back and looked at it. <br />
You were sweating. You were so hot. But it felt. <br />
So. Good. <br />
Just huffing and panting at this point. <br />
<br />
Scared and grabbing for the measuring tape you held it up. Before it had definitely been 7 inches. You remembered. But now... <br />
You felt it pulsing as you pulled the tape out, and out. It was 9... no...<br />
Your eyes widened as you saw it literally grow before your eyes. Pushing to 9.25, 9.5, 9.75... 10! <br />
<br />
You checked the girth, but that was tough because it was round, maybe 2 ish inches... <br />
The tape snapped back into the roll as another wave hit, you dropped it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; you yelped, eyes rolling back. <br />
Oh man. That was. That was so good. But you were panicking a little. <br />
What if it didn&#39;t stop. What if you were found having infinite orgasms back here. <br />
<br />
Then. <br />
Again! <br />
&quot;Ah&quot; you bent over, as it went off again, biting your lip. <br />
Again!<br />
AGAIN!<br />
<br />
You might as well have been foaming at the mouth at this point. <br />
Your dick was on fire. Your balls felt like they were about to burst. <br />
Your hands were barely touching it as it kept going and going. <br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t sure what happened. You may have blacked out.<br />
<br />
You sat up groggily. Holding your head. Feeling thirsty. And... vaguely horny?<br />
Ugh... Your crotch was tingling but you weren&#39;t erect. You sat up in the dim light of the backroom bathroom and rubbed your hair away from your sweaty forehead. The motion activated lights went from resting dim to slightly brighter. <br />
You leaned forward but something felt... off. <br />
It felt the tip of your dick was rubbing... around the ground. <br />
You looked down, impressed and horrified. <br />
<br />
Snaking away from you nearly to your knees was a monster dick. Your mouth dropped open in horror. It was huge! <br />
Like inhumanely huge!<br />
<br />
Soft now with a big of a curve it was solidly nearly the length and thickness of one of your arms. No way could you fuck anyone with that without hurting them. Hell most people couldn&#39;t fit a fist in their mouth how were you supposed to fit something like this. <br />
<br />
It also felt like you were pinching your balls. Spreading your legs, you got more surprises. Between your thighs resting were balls about the size of a cantaloupe<br />
Each.<br />
Melon. Sized. Balls. <br />
<br />
That.. was going to be hard to hide. <br />
Shakily you stood up and the weight was apparent. You could feel your massive trunk swinging below you. Balls sagging with weight between your legs. You could feel the air on them, dangling. It literally felt like someone had shoved two melons under you and glued them to your skin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god...&quot; you whispered seeing them in the mirror. Tentatively you grabbed your underwear and tried to pull it on. But it looked ridiculous. You could barely shove your balls in. It might as well have been underwear JUST for your balls. You left it hanging around your testes awkwardly. Dick still hanging in the breeze. <br />
<br />
Wait your stockings!<br />
You pulled your socks off and slid it around your dick. It slipped in easily. Nearly filling the thing. You wrapped the second stocking around your waist like a belt, and folded your dick into a U shape, trying to tie them together. <br />
After a few minutes struggle you had... something. <br />
<br />
You let your skirt drop.<br />
Well it wasn&#39;t obvious in a dress. <br />
<br />
But you realized you weren&#39;t sure how to get The Embiggenator off. <br />
It had sort of been your Hail Mary effort and now you were a bit of a freak. <br />
What if you got horny? What if you needed to use a public urinal?<br />
<br />
You really didn&#39;t want your family members to try and fix this. Not to mention you were using costume supplies they didn&#39;t even make. <br />
Your stomach turned as you felt nauseous. </p>
