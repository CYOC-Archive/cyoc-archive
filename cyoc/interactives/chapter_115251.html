<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron woke up to the buzzing of his phone.  He picked it up hoping it was the man answering his texts but it was just his alarm.  Disappointed he rolled over and got his gym clothes on.  Aaron went about his day as normal.  He got to the gym and felt a bit nervous waiting for the man to either text.  He was also hoping and dreading that the man would be at the gym and he would run into him.  <br />
Aaron continued through his day with sports and classes until lunch.  At this point Aaron’s anxiety had died down with the distraction of school. Then his phone buzzed in his pocket.  It was an unknown number calling.  He picked it up and answered it. <br />
“Hey, you the kid from the locker room the other day?”  Aaron could hear the man’s voice on the other end.<br />
“Yes,” he replied.<br />
“Want to meet me this afternoon?”  the man inquired.<br />
“Meet for what?”  Aaron asked in return.<br />
“Just meet up,”  the man said curtly.  Aaron paused trying to think of what he had to do this afternoon, what the man wanted to do, what he could do for the man, how he had gotten into the situation.  Aaron’s mind continued to ramble until the man spoke up again.  “So,” The man said in anticipation.<br />
“Ummm, ok I guess I can’t meet after school, but I also have sports and homework,”  Aaron replied in a childish voice.<br />
“That doesn’t matter boy.  You and I both know you want more.  I’ll pick you up in front of your high school.”  He said in a dominant manner.<br />
“How do you know what school I go to?”  Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
“That you don’t need to worry about,” the man replied then he hung up.  Aaron was worried now.  Anxious, he went to the rest of his afternoon classes.  He texted his coach to tell him he wasn’t feeling well so he wouldn’t be to practice.  The bell of seventh period rung and Aaron quickly packed up all of his books and school gear.  He swung his backpack up on his shoulder as he made his way to the front of the school.  Bumping into people and keeping his head down Aaron moved as fast as he could without running.  Finally, Aaron bust through the front doors of the school.  He looked around for any car that looked out of place and he didn’t see anything.  Then he looked for the man and he was nowhere to be found.  Disappointed he sat down on the stairs of the school.<br />
Aaron sat there on the steps until most of the students had gone, nearly an hour.  Finally, a black SUV pulled up and the man yelled from the driver’s seat.  “Get in the back kid,” the man said as he waved his hand.  Aaron couldn’t see in the windows of the car but he had already waited this long and was just glad the man showed up.  Opening the door Aaron took off his backpack first and got in.  Settling into his seat he closed the door then looked up.  When he looked up he looked forward to the man in the front seat.  He had started the car and pulled out.  Then he looked to his left and there was a large Asian man sitting there.  Aaron opened his mouth as if to say something but before he could get a word out the Asian man spoke.<br />
“So, Tony here, says that you’ve been using my wares,” He said, “I’m here to collect payment.”<br />
“I, I don’t know what you mean,” Aaron replied meekly.<br />
“Well as Tony tells me, he gave you an astounding experience in the locker room of your gym the other day, so I’m here to collect payment.”<br />
“Wait, what, but but I didn’t ask it for anything, it just happened and..,” Aaron tried to get out but then he was cut off.<br />
“So one blow job and one load from one of my more earnest studs.,” the man started counting on his fingers, “with the first time discount just for you because you look to be of meager means.  I’d say $750 should cover it,”<br />
“What, wha..,” Aaron could barely get out the words,” But I can’t get that, I’m still in high school.  That’s too much money,”<br />
“Well maybe then you shouldn’t buy if you don’t have the money,” He replied.  Aaron started to sob.  “It’s ok baby,”  The man put one arm around Aaron and brought him in for a hug, I’m sure we can work something out.  Don’t you have any savings or a part time job?”  <br />
“Nnnoonoo,” Aaron as tears started to form and Aaron looked up at the Asian man.  He propped Aaron back up and patted him on the shoulder.<br />
“Now, now no need to cry.  It’s not as if I’m going to have my friends beat you up or kill you.  Then how would I make my money back.” He started to run his hands through Aaron’s hair.  “Tony there says you have a nice cock, is that true?”  <br />
“Umm,.. .nnono…yesss. ummm.” Aaron tried to reply.<br />
The Asian man moved his hand from Aaron’s hair down to his lips.  “Well you do have pretty lips” he said as he moved his thumb across them.  Aaron then looked down and saw that the  man was rubbing his own cock through his trousers.  Then he continued, “well if you have no money, and you don’t know how big your cock is then I have to ask how do you think you are going to repay me.  The man stared at Aaron and Aaron stared back.  Through the tears in Aaron’s eyes he saw the lust of the Asian man.  The Asian man then took one hand and undid his belt buckle, pushed his pants down just far enough for his cock to pop out.  An average tan penis popped out.  It was uncut but smelled clean.  <br />
The Asian man then grabbed Aaron gently by the lip that he was caressing and lead him down to his penis.  Aaron began to resist but by then the man had taken Aaron by the hair.  Aaron then swallowed the Asian man’s cock down to the base. “Not bad, not bad, now let’s help you work off some of that debt.”  The Asian man bucked his hips as Aaron bobbed his head up and down.  He must get off with his men pretty often Aaron thought after what had been forever had passed.  The Asian man could feel that Aaron was getting tired and pulled his head up by his hair.  “Now you didn’t think it was going to be that easy did you?”  The Asian man then snuck his hand down the back of Aaron’s pant.  “Such a nice cute butt you have.  I think this will make a great addition to my collection.”  The man said as he rubbed his middle finger against Aaron’s hole.  “So tight though, you will need some training.  But first let’s see how you handle this.”  The Asian man then snapped his fingers three times and started to moan and groan and huff.  Suddenly he bucked his hips hard and fast into Aaron’s face.  Then, Aaron felt as the man’s penis pulsed cum into his mouth.  Aaron swallowed the first few spurts that he was used to but it just kept coming.  Aaron started to panic, his lips were somehow bound to the base of this man’s cock.  <br />
Aaron tried to pull up or gasp for air but the cum just kept filling his mouth.  Without any other choice, he started to swallow as fast as he could.  Gulp after gulp it felt like he was chugging a gallon of milk.  Finally, the man snapped his fingers three times again.  Aaron felt his lips free as the man’s cock stopped spewing cum.  “Doing that to newbies is always fun,”  The Asian man added.  He propped up a dazed Aaron who was catching his breath and then handing him a napkin to wipe the drips from his face.  <br />
“Now, I’ll give you that was at least a $25 dollar blowjob.  Now I’ll give you the choice on how to pay the rest.”</p>
