<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>As with Sylvia&#39;s wedding, this chapter probably takes place sooner than the current time.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The element of wood can symbolize different things. Naturally, wood can be a symbol of growth, but it can also be a symbol of inflexibility. Muxing was self-conscious to be aware that both of these traits describe rather well, the latter in particular. For a snake, she had been rather rigid and unbending compared to the rest of her sisters. She was the least willing to let loose and enjoy herself after their conversions. She had borne the most emotional scars from their time being used as sex slaves from that cult. The trauma had made her bitter towards anything sexual, which was hard to avoid among Animalians.<br />
<br />
But Muxing had also had a lot of growth. She was slowly able to move on from the pain of the past. Particularly after meeting Li-Wei. Muxing hadn&#39;t thought she&#39;d ever meet a man who would interest her after her experiences. Li-Wei was a different case, in more ways than one. Perhaps the one that mattered most was that Li-Wei had been an uplifted snake rather than a converted human and their world view was a lot simpler and less demanding. Muxing found their presence rather comforting and found herself warming up more than she thought herself capable of. So much so that she was the one who proposed marriage to them.<br />
<br />
Of course, things weren&#39;t quite that simple. Li-Wei may have started as a simple two-headed snake, but both heads had their own personalities and preferences. And while Wei did like Muxing, he didn&#39;t like her the same way Li did. So Wei wanted his own mate before Muxing and Li could marry. Fang was the unexpected answer to their search. Not only did Fang become a tree viper to join their relationship, but shi became a hermaphrodite to express both sides of hir sexuality. As misanthropic as Muxing had been, she hadn&#39;t ever truly considered women in that way. Though Fang proved to be a good compliment to both her and Li-Wei.<br />
<br />
After they won the Year of the Snake competition (well, Muxing and Li-Wei won, Iphis and Ianthe won the herm division), they were ready to be married. Muxing was hoping for a wedding under cherry blossoms, but there were some complications from that. Most of it was that she and Sylvia Rattlerton had promised to be at each other’s weddings. And Sylvia’s future aunt and uncle-in-law had insisted on an unnecessarily lavish wedding. It took a lot more time to talk them down than was anticipated. So long that Muxing and Fang have entered their breeding season and there was good reason to suspect that they were carrying eggs. Fortunately, that was the last straw needed to make Sylvia put her metaphorical foot down and insist on the wedding now.<br />
<br />
Muxing was glad that Sylvia had her wedding, though she was a bit uncomfortable with being in that bridesmaid’s dress. Still, the important part was that Sylvia had her wedding, now Muxing could have hers. Fortunately, her wedding won’t need so much bruhaha, though there wasn’t real time for Sylvia to convert Andrew.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Compared to Shuixing&#39;s wedding, the bureaucratic preparations for the wedding were much simpler. Li-Wei didn&#39;t have as much of a past and didn&#39;t have to be as concerned about dual-citizenship. Fang was given a bit more trouble, seemingly because shi was a herm, but there was reason to suspect it was because shi was Tibetan. However, it wasn&#39;t too hard for all of them to complete their paperwork.<br />
<br />
The ceremony wasn&#39;t too difficult. Buddhist weddings don&#39;t require nearly as much pomp and circumstance as Christian weddings. The main adjustment was this was essentially a double-wedding. Some may say this was also a triple-wedding as Muxing and Fang had gotten rather close to each other. The three (four) serpents did look very nice in their dharka robes of emerald green. But after a brief saying of vows and a kissing of the brides, the ceremony was over.<br />
<br />
Muxing&#39;s sisters soon gathered around her to wish her well. &quot;I&#39;m so glad you found someone to share your life with,&quot; said Shuixing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you have children to keep you happy,&quot; said Tuxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of which, are you and Lenard expecting?&quot; asked Jinxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; said Tuxing, &quot;We want Mikey to grow up a little more before we add to the family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give him a double-dose and you&#39;ll take care of that right away,&quot; said Huoxing jokingly.<br />
<br />
Tuxing gave the red panda a playful swat and said, &quot;Behave yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m just glad that Muxing&#39;s finally hitched. Now it&#39;ll be me and Gang&#39;s turn next. Then maybe Jinxing can have a winter wedding,&quot; said Huoxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s not be hasty about that,&quot; said Jinxing.<br />
<br />
Mizu was glad to see her mentor off on her honeymoon as well. Muxing was a bit more hesitant to pass on the mantle to her protege right now. After all, she and her new family still hadn&#39;t a place of their own yet. And in Muxing&#39;s eyes, Mizu wasn&#39;t quite ready to be part of the Five Elements yet. As a nonvenomous snake, she had less weapons than Muxing and needed to train harder to make up for them. Admittedly, it was unlike Mizu would ever get into a real fight, but Muxing was a little paranoid about that.<br />
<br />
Sylvia wondered if the short ceremony was worth all the fuss, but her own wedding has took too long to deal with. She was just glad she was able to finally be there for her friend&#39;s wedding before they went to their separate honeymoons. &quot;So, where will the world-famous Muxing of the Five Elements go on her honeymoon?&quot; asked Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aiko offered us a quiet time on Ao Guang Island,&quot; said Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet time? On what&#39;s rapidly becoming Animalia&#39;s version of Macao?&quot; asked Sylvia in amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s very quiet in the Silent Grove,&quot; said Muxing, &quot;Practically isolated from the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that would fit your element,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;And where is your millionaire husband taking you to consummate your marriage?&quot; asked Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mieni Atoll,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;During all the commotion for the IAC and that bikini contest?&quot; asked Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You think I couldn&#39;t enter the contest myself?&quot; asked Sylvia jokingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s going to be hard to get any private time to yourselves,&quot; said Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s always Lover&#39;s Lagoon,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope he learns how to swim with a tail quick,&quot; said Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we&#39;re going to go through quite a wardrobe update during our stay,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I hope your eggs will be bountiful,&quot; said Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;re ready for that yet,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;When the time comes, I&#39;m sure there will be bounty,&quot; said Muxing.<br />
<br />
With that, the three (four) tree vipers headed to their honeymoon south to Ao Guang while the rattlesnake took the soon-to-be second rattlesnake to Mieni Atoll in the southeast.</p>
