<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason stirred to the sounds of heavy breathing. His eyes fluttered open to just the barest hint of daylight coming into the room. Dean sat on the edge of the bed, one of his weights in hand doing bicep curls. He wore no shirt and Jason could see his muscles shifting under his skin, the way the veins popped a bit when he flexed. Wait. He was in Dean&#39;s bed? &quot;Oh shit. Did I fall asleep in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean looked over to Jason and grinned. &quot;Yeah, no worries though, I guess you&#39;re still getting used to physical labor all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have kicked me out.&quot; Jason muttered as he shifted into a sitting position. The sheets slipped down exposing his own bare chest. Hadn&#39;t he been wearing a shirt. &quot;Where&#39;d you sleep?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right next to you.&quot; Dean said with a laugh. &quot;Not the first time we shared a bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were kids the last time we did that.&quot; Jason muttered, he moved the sheets aside to get up and realized he was completely nude under the sheets, he quickly grabbed them and covered himself back up. &quot;What the hell?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you&#39;d be more comfortable.&quot; Dean stood up from the side of the bed and Jason saw his cousin wasn&#39;t only shirtless, he was naked as well. &quot;Not like it&#39;s anything I didn&#39;t see in the showers.&quot; He put the weight back on the rack and turned back to Jason, hands on hips in a super hero pose. His large cock stood up hard and proud but there was something wrong with it. It didn&#39;t look human, instead he had a chestnut-furred animal like sheath that went up nearly to his navel, his heavy balls were also covered in the animal-like fur. The cock that stuck out from the sheath was mottled black and pink, with a flat head and a ring shaped bump around the middle. Dean caught him staring a smiled. &quot;Told you I was half horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason sat frozen, mesmerized, as Dean climbed onto the bed, moving in closer. He placed a hand on the back of Jason&#39;s neck and pulled him in close. Their lips met..<br />
<br />
Jason shot awake to his cock twitching between his legs. He reached down under the covers and felt a warm, sticky patch spreading on the front of his shorts. The window showed only night outside though let in an amazing amount of moonlight. He did feel something large and warm pressed up against his back, one arm draped over him. Dean had the slow, deep breaths of someone deep asleep.<br />
<br />
A dream. A wet dream. When was the last time he had one of those, and about his cousin of all people. Jason, carefully moved Dean&#39;s arm, which was surprisingly heavy, off of him, then slipped out from under the sheets, relieved to see he was still completely dressed. He turned to look at Dean, who was shirtless. Cautiously, Jason lifted the covers enough to get a look under and breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Dean was wearing pajama pants, though the front of them was obviously tented.<br />
<br />
His eyes drifted up to Dean&#39;s face, which he could just make out in the darkness. He could still feel those lips on his. The dream seemed so real. He slipped out of the bed and quietly tiptoed to the door. It creaked a little as he opened it but he got out into the hall and closed it without a noise. He turned around and almost screamed.<br />
<br />
Shiloh stood at the top of the stairs, a midnight snack bowl of cereal in his hand. He was chewing away and just staring at Jason, his brown hair a mess and his jaw covered in stubble. There was something oddly familiar to that face, and not just because he looked like Silas. He was shirtless exposing a brown-furred and well muscled chest, though he was smaller than Dean and Rex, he still had a good bulk to him. He looked Jason up and down, blue eyes lingering on the damp patch on the front of his shorts for a long moment. Jason squirmed under the gaze.<br />
<br />
Putting his spoon back in the bowl, he reached out and ruffled Jason&#39;s hair like a fond older brother then continued on to his room, &quot;Don&#39;t stay up too late.&quot; It was the first words he had heard from Shiloh, his voice soft and warm. Jason just stared after the man until his door was closed then quietly made his way into his own bedroom.<br />
<br />
He peeled off his shorts and tossed them into the growing pile of dirty clothes. Sliding out of his underwear he used those to clean himself off. His dick was covered ins sticky, drying cum. He stopped once he felt his balls and stared down. Something was wrong. He flicked on the light and gave a start. He was bigger! If there&#39;s one thing every guy knows its his own package. His cock was about an inch longer and his balls were maybe half again as big as they were supposed to be.<br />
<br />
He sat on the edge of the bed, where he could examine himself easier. It weren&#39;t sore, and it didn&#39;t hurt, but maybe he should ask his uncle to take him to a doctor anyway? His doctor had been assuring him that he might have another growth spurt in him, but they didn&#39;t happen this fast. Did they?<br />
<br />
He lowered his face into his hands. He couldn&#39;t think straight right now. He stood up and grabbed a clean pair of briefs which felt a bit more snug than usual. No, he&#39;d think about it in the morning. He turned off his light and slipped into bed, for a moment missing the presence of Dean right behind him. He growled in annoyance at himself and pulled the covers up, trying to think about something else, someone else, as he drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
Jason woke up for a third time to a knock on his door. He crawled out of bed. &quot;One sec.&quot; He opened it and felt a flutter in his chest to see Dean standing there in just his pajama pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just, uh, wanted to check on you.&quot; Dean said as he ran his hand through bed-mussed blind hair. &quot;You didn&#39;t need to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, um, had to go to the bathroom, just seemed better to come back to my own room.&quot; Jason lied, trying to keep his face straight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Dean muttered. &quot;Breakfast is in a few, you should probably get dressed.&quot; Dean winked and headed towards the bathroom, probably to take a morning shower. Jason slipped back inside his room and stripped out of his night clothes tossing them on the bed. He looked down at himself. His muscles were still swollen from yesterday, and his cock was as it had been when he changed clothes last night so that hadn&#39;t been his imagination. Even his hands and feet looked weirdly big. He grumbled and tried on some clothes. Nothing from his suitcase fit right anymore, so he got dressed in another pair of borrowed overalls. His boots sat a the foot of the bed, cleaned of mud, Silas&#39; work probably. He stomped into those and headed downstairs for breakfast.</p>
