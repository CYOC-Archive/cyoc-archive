<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“This is getting tiresome.” complained Naamah as she along with all but one of the humans stood watching the other human kneeling in the black soil of hell praying loudly to God to save her from this fate. She had wanted to start walking toward the palace to have these human transforms in something like style but one of them was refusing to move. That was to be expected and was common, but it was now pushing two hours and that was nearing a record. <br />
<br />
“Please Lord oh God look down on your humble daughter and save me from this demon and return me and my friends to the light of your glory.” Proclaimed Rebecca Bishop as the evangelical girl prayed over and over again. <br />
<br />
“I don’t mind, this place is so cool.” Answered Riley as she studied the bone white trees with multiple screaming faces in it. “Question, Naamah if these are souls of those who killed themselves what other punishments are there.”<br />
<br />
“Any kind you can imagine, the worse of the worse are taken care by the Devil himself and the court.” Stated Naamah “If you have a grudge against someone you can get on the waiting list, the worse the person the longer the wait. Last I check the list for an hour to punish Hitler was almost 200 years.”<br />
<br />
“Only 200?” inquired Delilah “I thought it would be longer than that.”<br />
<br />
“Well demons and angles aren’t immortal, our life spans are much longer than humans but we all die.” Stated Naamah “I am nearly 400 and that would be about 40 in human terms.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t look a day over 300.” Stated Riley with a grin, it was true this succubus looked like she wasn’t over the age of 35. <br />
<br />
“Oh God…” proclaimed Rebecca again.<br />
<br />
“Will you at least be quiet about it!” snapped Emily as she stood with her arms crossed and an extremely pissed off look across her face.<br />
<br />
“Love, it’s ok, we are together at least.” Confirmed Alyssa as she pulled down her girlfriends’ arms and wrapped her hands around them. “Whatever happens we are together.”<br />
<br />
Delilah felt a rush of pain/want as she looked at the two of them, she wished she had what they had. More of Alyssa then for Emily but she wasn’t the type of person to go after another’s persons partner.<br />
<br />
“So your said our fathers…where actually succubus who took human male form to impregnate our mothers?” inquired Delilah to get her mind off the couple. <br />
<br />
“For the most part, you may have a father, an incubus that is a male succubus in that case your demon mothers would have used sperm from him instead of some random human.” Explained Lady Naamah “I actually don’t know who your parent or parents are, once you transform your true demon line will be shown and your parents identified.”<br />
<br />
“My Father is the father above and his only son!” yelled Rebecca<br />
<br />
“For the shake of hell, shut up!” snapped Naamah “You don’t know the true shape of the cosmos. Your God, the one you pray too died about a 100 years ago. The whole son coming down to Earth was just a sort of tradition when whoever holds the title of God or Devil retires their heir goes to Earth before taking the throne.”<br />
<br />
“Wait…God is dead?” inquired Delilah, as Rebecca and the others looked at Naamah with stunned expressions.<br />
<br />
“No God and the devil are titles, Jesus is now God and sits on the throne of heaven in another two or three thousand years his daughter will go to Earth before she takes up the title of God when Jesus retires.” Stated Naamah “Same goes for the Devil, the current Devil has only been on the throne for a thousand years, he is still pretty new.”<br />
<br />
“Then why doesn’t God smash him!” snapped Rebecca “You are lying.”<br />
<br />
“Heaven and Hell are in…what do you humans call it.” Paused Naamah “A winter war…”<br />
<br />
“Cold War?” inquired Emily as Naamah snapped her fingers.<br />
<br />
“That is it.” Stated Naamah “Neither side wants a war because we don’t know who would win, besides at the moment both sides are getting what they want. We in hell get a lot of souls to punish and after they are punished they go to heaven.”<br />
<br />
“So everyone goes to heaven?” inquired Riley<br />
<br />
“For the most part, the worse of the worse stay forever here, the best of the best go straight to heaven. Most spend a couple of years to a 100 years down here with us before moving on.” Explained Naamah <br />
<br />
“I don’t believe you.” Snapped Rebecca as she jumped to her feet and put her finger in Naamah’s face. Naamah rolled her eyes but didn’t get up from the rock she was sitting on. “I believe in the Lord my God…”<br />
<br />
Before Rebecca could go on, she fell to her knees in pain and gripped her sides. <br />
<br />
“Oh God…it hurts what is happening?” inquired Rebecca <br />
<br />
“My Guess your change, likely it will be something small first.” Stated Naamah as it was now her turn to have eyes widen as Rebecca’s modest blouse ripped apart. Even her bra ripped apart as her breasts became exposed. As they did, Rebecca always the modest type moved her hands to cover herself. Growing out of her shoulder blades was the reason why her clothes had ripped. A pair of wings began to form. <br />
It wasn’t the bat like wings of a demon but something that looked like they would belong to an angle, for a second even Naamah wondered if there was someway that this human’s prayer had been answered and she was going to heaven. Then the wings expanded and when they did, it was clear that they where not covered in feathers or even bat like flesh but instead made out of bones. <br />
<br />
“What is happening.” Cried Rebecca as her skin began to shift color, or better yet the color seamed to be totally disappearing from her flesh. It was almost as if she was becoming an albino, all the colors disappeared from her body. Her blonde hair also began to shift, into something which shouldn’t have been possible a shade of white more white then her flesh. Her blue eyes shifted into an almost glowing red, even as her lips turned impossible black. <br />
<br />
Rebecca began to couch as her teeth feel out, as she raised a hand up to her mouth everyone was able to see that her breasts had grown a bit and her nipples had turned pitch black as well as her finger nails. Then color began to return to her flesh but it wasn’t something anyone really wanted to see, it was if her bones where turning black under her skin so that a sort of dark grey outline of the bones appeared on her flesh. <br />
<br />
For a while nothing happened as Rebecca lied on all fours breathing heavily her new wings sticking out of her back. Her pants where still intact for the most part, but they did slightly rip as the changes seamed to have finished.<br />
<br />
“Looks like you are done.” Said Naamah <br />
<br />
“My God.” said Riley as she looked at her friend, her bone white flesh with dark highlights of her bones, her bone wings and black lips where screaming death itself and for the metal head she was she loved it. “She looks so cool.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I was somewhat wrong.” Said Naamah as she walked toward Rebecca Bishop “You are not a succubus, you are an angel.”<br />
<br />
“An angel…” said Rebecca her voice weak.<br />
<br />
“You will go to earth to help you father, death himself collect souls of those who have died.” Proclaimed Naamah “You are an angel of death, a Grim Reaper as humans would call it.”</p>
