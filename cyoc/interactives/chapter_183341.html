<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Alexis!” A voice shouted from the distance, “Alexis please! Help us!” They yelled once more. Alexis looked around, seeing nothing by darkness. The abyss. He looked down to see nothing but himself. He lifted his hands, seeing them twitch and twist, tainted in a purple colour that couldn’t bled onto his fingers like ink to a paper, glowing. He looked back up to see nothing. No voice, no people, nothing. He just felt-<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Alexis sat up in his bed, grabbing at his chest, feeling his heart pound like a drum. He was breathing rapidly. His dream was nothing like he’d ever felt before, so real yet so far from it. But as with all dreams, it faded. It was starting to blur in his memory as quickly as he remembered it, until it was nothing but the feeling of a memory. It was gone.<br />
<br />
He let out a deep breath of air before pushing himself up, sitting on the edge of his bed. He stretched out his arms and yawned. Alexis stood up and made his way to his bathroom. He walked in, feeling the tiles on his bare feet as he grabbed a toothbrush. After brushing his teeth, he rubbed his eyes and looked in the mirror.<br />
He looked completely normal. He didn’t know why he expected to look any different.<br />
He stepped in his shower after throwing his underwear on the ground, and turned it on. He felt the cold water over his body before it started warming up. He grabbed soap and started cleaning himself. <br />
All seemed routine until he got to his lower regions. He looked down, seeing his penis. He had the urge to just give it a light rub as he showered, but he held back, knowing what could happen. His penis was still long, even while flaccid, but unlike the end of yesterday, his balls had reduced back to a manageable size.<br />
Alexis finished in the shower, turning off the water. He started to dry himself before catching a glimpse of his body in the mirror. He looked at himself.<br />
<br />
After Alexis’ disaster at school, he had been incredibly drained. He hadn’t been able to control his powers since the moment Monica sucked his dick. Attempting to fix the people he had changed only resulted in more chaos, like Emily’s breasts, and letting his emotions take over only resulted in making Brianna becoming an immobile blob. Alexis needed to see if he was able to change things again.<br />
He looked himself in the mirror. He didn’t want to change anything too drastically, so he best option was to give himself a little chest hair. Easy enough.<br />
He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and used his power.<br />
<br />
Alexis opened his eyes, he looked at his bare chest. Nothing. Not even a little fluff had appeared. He couldn’t do it. All hope was lost... until he remembered the feeling. The feeling he got on the morning of his 18th birthday. The feeling that never went away. It was still there. He still had his power. He just needed someone to help him fix it.<br />
<br />
“Alexis?” His father said from inside his room. Alexis immediately panicked, picking up the towel he dropped on the ground and covering his dick,<br />
“Dad!” Alexis shouted, “I’m naked!” He warned,<br />
“Got it,” his father replied, “I spoke with your school and you’re taking a day off. You definitely need it,” he said. Alexis had completely forgotten about school. He started thinking about those kids, his classmates he’d left to suffer in their transformed bodies. Alexis’ mind was racing, what about his friends!? What about the rest of the school!?Alexis rushed out of the bathroom, his dad was standing there, not expecting his son to burst into the room, “whoah!” His father said, startled,<br />
“Dad! What happened to the people in my Math class!? I left them and-”<br />
“Alex!” His father said loudly, but not angrily, “I sorted it out. I shrank them all down and made them all completely forget about everything,”<br />
“E-everything?” Alexis questioned,<br />
“Yes, everything. They just remember having a regular math class and then going back home. None of them will remember anything. Clothes repaired, memories wiped, and bodies reduced. Everything has been sorted out appropriately,”<br />
“Okay,” Alexis said, letting himself breathe normally, “thank you, dad,” he said,<br />
“Don’t worry about it, son,” he responded. He started walking to the door, “now I’ll make you some breakfast and we can talk about everything. Okay?” He said,<br />
“Y-yeah. That sounds good,” Alexis replied. His father smiled to him, Alexis smiled back as he closed the door.<br />
Alexis didn’t want to waste any time. He grabbed some underwear, a shirt, some shorts and finally some socks before walking to his door. He looked at his phone, on the side of his bed, “nah,” he said to himself, closing the door.<br />
<br />
Alexis walked down the hallways to the staircase, noticing his mother with a basket of laundry, “Hi mom,” he said,<br />
“Alexis!” She said happily, she placed her basket down on the floor, “I’m so happy to see you up,” she opened her arms and Alexis hugged her, “I thought you’d be out for another four hours,” she said, she chuckled softly,<br />
“Well, looks like you don’t get that kind of luxury,” he said, making his mother laugh. Alexis pulled away from the hug, “I’ll let you get back to what you’re doing,” he said, moving out of the way for her,<br />
“Aw, thanks Alex,” she reached down and grabbed her basket again, then looked at Alexis again, “I think you might need a haircut,” she said, ruffling his red hair,<br />
“You think?” He asked, grabbing a little bit of his hair,<br />
“Yeah, I think it’s getting a little long. Soon you’ll be looking like me!” She said, shaking her head to show off her own red hair. Her hair had always been about as long as where her chin was. She had soft and straight hair that Alexis had clearly inherited from her, which he wasn’t complaining about. In fact, he had inherited a lot of things from his mother. His freckles that dotted just under his eyes and over his nose, his brown eyes, the shade of his skin. Most of his defining features came from his mother, however his powers clearly didn’t come from her. That reminded him,<br />
“Oh, I’ve gotta get breakfast, mom,” he said,<br />
“Oh yeah. Don’t let me keep you hungry,” she said. Alexis was again reminded of Monica, how his powers made her belly bloat. Alexis didn’t want that to happen, so he quickly went for the stairs, waving his mother goodbye with a partially forced smile. She smiled back to him as she went back to her laundry.<br />
<br />
Alexis got to the bottom of the stairs, looking around for his father,<br />
“Right behind you,” his father said. Alexis, startled, jumped forward before spinning around to see his father with a plate of toast, “just how you like it?” He said,<br />
“Y-yeah...” Alexis said, letting his breathing return to normal. He took the plate and sat down at the table, he took a large bite out of the toast,<br />
“So, let’s talk about you,” his father started. Alexis, unable to respond, nodded. His father looked at him, “as I saw at your school. Your powers got out of control after you orgasmed-” Alexis chocked on his toast, making his father pause. He coughed a couple times before looking at his father,<br />
“J-just keep talking...”<br />
“Yes. So after you orgasmed, your powers took over. Right?” He looked at Alexis, who had just taken another bite of toast. He nodded once more, “and resulted in your classmates changing and expanding in a number of unique ways,” Alexis nodded again. His father leaned back in his chair, “you’ll be surprised, but that’s actually a good thing.” Alexis raised an eyebrow, taking another bite of toast, “it shows that you have a great imagination. Your powers are linked to emotions, but are only limited by what your mind can create,” he explained. Alexis nodded in understanding. He swallowed his bite of toast,<br />
“So the changes I made are what my mind was thinking about?” Alexis asked,<br />
“Not necessarily.” His father responded, “yes, if you did have something on your mind, it would be more likely to happen unconsciously. However, the extent of what your changes will do without your direct input is limited to what you think is possible at that moment,”<br />
“What do you mean? Everything that happened is impossible,” Alexis corrected,<br />
“To an extent,” he explained further, “what you did all makes sense in how you perceive reality. You made a guy more muscular, you made a woman a giant, you made a girl fatter, you made another girl’s breasts huge and lactating milk,”<br />
“Y-yeah...” Alexis said, semi-awkwardly, but still with a question on his mind, “the bo- breasts were unrealistically large! As was that girl with the huge hips, it wasn’t realistic!”<br />
“Yes. It wouldn’t make sense usually, but it does when you...” his father struggled to find a good example with words, “okay, why don’t I just show you instead.” His father said. Alexis looked confused,<br />
“Show me, how?” He asked. His father looked out the window behind him, Alexis turned around to see a young woman jogging around the neighbourhood.<br />
“Quickly, give me a feature of this woman. Just off the top of your head,” his father asked him. Alexis didn’t know how to respond, “okay let’s just go with her belly,” he said, “now watch closely,”<br />
Alexis looked at the woman. She was wearing a tank top and sweatpants. She started to slow down suddenly, grabbing onto the arm of a nearby bench. She arched over, taking a few breaths. But quickly started to move her body as if she gagging. Alexis watched as her belly started growing. It started to press against her tank top, even as she was arched over. With each growth, her body retched forward. Her belly was now starting to become more visible. Her belly button was now poking out. She seemed completely in shock and uncomfortable. Her belly’s expansion started to slow as she stood, panting. It was at a halt now, she was breathing heavily and rapidly before finally trying to push herself up to her feet. Her belly stuck out as if she was at least 7 months pregnant. She looked horrified,<br />
“Y-y-you just made the poor woman pregnant!?” Alexis exclaimed,<br />
“Exactly,” his father said, pointing a finger out the window again. Alexis turned to face her, “the difference is what see see as possible,” she started to gag in some kind of way, again and again, as if she was going to vomit suddenly, “and what I see as possible.”<br />
She was clearly in agony, but Alexis could do nothing to help her. He started to notice that with every retch, she was starting to squat more and more. She stopped suddenly, now in a full squat. Then, she covered her mouth, assuming she would probably vomit, but instead her legs started to spread. She quickly grabbed onto the bench behind her, taking deep breath after deep breath. She had to pull down her sweatpants and underwear, all the way down to her calves,<br />
“I get!” Alexis shouted, “she’s going into labour, you can do that I get-” but was interrupted by a simple,<br />
“Watch,”<br />
Alexis turned back around to see the woman struggling to push something out. She struggled and struggled and struggled until...<br />
Pop!<br />
An egg popped out.<br />
“What the fu-” <br />
And then another came out. Quickly, 3 more eggs were squeezed out of her vagina. Her belly had been flattened out again, and on the ground beneath her laid 5 eggs, all of a strange fleshy colour. She looked completely dumbfounded, having nothing to warn her about what she just had to go through.<br />
<br />
“Do you understand what I’m saying now?” His father asked,<br />
Alexis didn’t know how to respond. He was just... in shock, “b-but... how can a human lay...” he stammered,<br />
“Exactly my point,” his father said, “they can’t. It makes no biological sense. Yet here we are, with a woman and her five unhatched eggs,”<br />
“I...” Alexis understood everything his father was saying now, yet he wasn’t happy. He turned around with an angry expression, “don’t do that again!” Alexis said,<br />
“W-what?” His father said, expression now in confusion,<br />
“Don’t just take some random woman and make her go through all of that,” Alexis said, firmly,<br />
“It was an example, Alex. And what difference is it to what you did to your classmates yesterday?” He asked his son,<br />
“That was an accident!” Alexis said, standing up from his seat,<br />
“Alex... I don’t want an argument out of this. I was just... demonstrating what I meant,”<br />
“But you made this girl suffer,” Alexis said, still a little heated,<br />
“Okay, okay. You have a fair point, I’m not saying you don’t,” his father said, “I’ll fix her. Watch,” he said pointing out the window.<br />
Alexis looked at the woman, she shook her head as if snapping out of a trance. Immediately, she grabbed all her eggs at once. She opened her mouth as wide as possible, but it kept getting wider, it was just wide enough for her to shove one of her eggs into her mouth. Alexis watched as the orange sized egg traveled down her throat whole. He could see it in her neck as it travelled into her stomach. She did another, travelling the same way. Then she took the last three eggs and shoved them all into her mouth, swelling all of them at once. Alexis could see the outline of them in her neck, as she swallowed them. He looked at her belly. It was flat,<br />
“And like that. It’s over,” his father said, crossing his arms with a smirk on his face,<br />
“But... how and- and why!?” Alexis asked, upset,<br />
“She didn’t suffer that time. She was clearly okay with it,” his father said, “plus, it never actually happened,” he said. Confusing Alexis again,<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
“With the power, we have control over everything. Time is one of them. You can rewrite time however you like, son. Like your classroom calamity, it never happened. Only you and I remember it because I decided so, but it was replaced with you going to that class, having a regular lesson, then coming home as normal. And that’s not an implanted memory, that is exactly what happened.” His father finished.<br />
Alexis was amazed, “so anything I do, I can just... delete?”<br />
“It’s...” his father hesitated, “it’s not as simple as that. Rearranging the course of reality is very dangerous. You can decide everything. Like if we said I gave your mother blonde hair, I could decide if everyone thinks she always had blonde hair, or I could decide that she always had blonde hair. In option two, it would result in your hair being blonde, and always being blonde. It’s confusing, I know, but you’ll get the hang of it eventually.”<br />
“Yeah I guess and-” Alexis remembered something, “oh... I meant to tell you when I came downstairs...” Alexis started,<br />
“What’s wrong, son?”<br />
“I... um...” he didn’t know how his father would feel, “I can’t use my powers anymore...” Alexis said, expecting his fathers heart to be immediately broken. He looked up to see him,<br />
“Oh. So that’s why you didn’t do anything about the woman?” His father asked,<br />
“Huh?” <br />
“That makes sense,” his father said,<br />
“You’re not upset?” Alexis asked,<br />
“Why would I be? I used to lose my powers all the time when I was your age. It always after an intense day of changing. All you gotta do is force yourself to change something. Once you’ve done that, it’ll all be working again,” he told Alexis.<br />
“Really?” Alexis said, a weight lifted off his chest,<br />
“Of course. Let’s get it jump-started again, right now,” his father said, standing up. He started walking to the door,<br />
“N-no!” Alexis blurted out, standing up again,<br />
“What’s the problem? We’ll find someone to change. Plus, it’ll give you some good training for changing things in ways you don’t consider,”<br />
“B-but...” Alexis didn’t want to upset his father, but he couldn’t bare the thought, “I don’t want to change anyone if they aren’t consenting to it,” he said. Standing his ground.<br />
His father chuckled, walking back over to Alexis, “you really are your mothers son,” he said, patting him on the shoulder, “but you have a fair point,” he said, “once you get a hang of it again, I’ll teach you to change people without them realising it,”<br />
Alexis wasn’t sure about that idea, but before he could say anything,<br />
“Not to worry,” his father said, “however we do need someone to test on,”<br />
“Wait...” Alexis said to himself.<br />
<br />
“Selena! Can you come down here for us? We need you for something!” Alexis’ father yelled up the stairs,<br />
“Okay!” She yelled back, cheerfully. Alexis could hear his mother walk down the stairs. She appeared in view, “what do you boys need?” She asked,<br />
“We need to use you for testing, is that alright by you?” Alexis’ father asked,<br />
“Oh! I forgot Alexis has your powers!” She said, smiling at Alexis.<br />
“We’ll just be over here, you do your own thing, dear,” his father said to her,<br />
“M-mom...” Alexis said, she turned around,<br />
“Yes, sweetie?”<br />
“Are you... okay with this?” Alexis asked. He father looked confused,<br />
“Didn’t I answer already?” She said, confused,<br />
“N-no. You didn’t answer,” Alexis said, “Are you seriously okay with being changed?” Alexis asked, very seriously,<br />
“I...” she looked to her husband, then back to him, “Alex. The first day I ever met your father was in College, which you already know. But the first day I ever spoke to him, he told me about his powers. And the rest is just history, isn’t it,” she said. Smiling at her husband. Alexis didn’t know that, but still hadn’t gotten a straight answer,<br />
“Mom?” He said, one last time,<br />
“Yes.” She replied, not questioning his comment. Answering it, “yes I am okay with it.” She said.<br />
<br />
“Perfect!” His father chimed in, startling both Alexis and his mother, “now why don’t we get started?”</p>
