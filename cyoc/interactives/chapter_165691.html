<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiden had a thought. Eric might be in control, but maybe he could still get what he wanted in the first place.<br />
<br />
“You don’t even know what I was planning on doing with the Chronivac,” Aiden said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, so it wasn’t purchased to turn yourself into a cock?” Eric laughed at the thought. “You’re rich. What were your grand plans, dear roommate?”<br />
<br />
Aiden mustered up the courage to say it out loud. “I…was going to use it to turn myself into a pet dog.”<br />
<br />
Eric’s eyes went wide. He broke out in laughter.<br />
<br />
Aiden went red with embarrassment. It was bad enough being a eunuch, nude slave, now he had revealed his deep secret to mockery.<br />
<br />
“Why would you want that,” Eric asked, coming down from his high. “And speak clearly, slave.”<br />
<br />
“I mean,” Aiden responded. “I thought it would be fun. I was going to change reality so that you thought I had always been your pet, see how it was. Test it out for a bit. Maybe use it as a vacation. I’ve always wanted to have that kind of carefree life, even if I didn’t have that much free will. I mean, I’d be a dog! What could be better?”<br />
<br />
“Well, that collar I put on you got you a bit closer at least,” Eric replied. “Don’t you think?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to be your slave, Eric,” Aiden said, starting to plead. “This wasn’t how it was supposed to go! It was a mistake, I didn’t want to end up as a cock, I don’t want to be your slave! Let me go!”<br />
<br />
“I’m not going to let you go,” Eric responded. “But, I might give you what you wanted. It would be just as fun for me, I think, having control of the Chronivac while you are my pet. I could play with the device on other people.”<br />
<br />
“You mean,” Aiden said. “You’re going to let me try being a dog?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Eric said. “If I turn you into a dog, you’re going to stay a dog. Forever. No change backs.” He turned to the Chronivac. “We can do that, right?”<br />
<br />
“Make him a puppy permanently?” It responded. “This processing system has done it more times than you think.”<br />
<br />
Eric smirked. “Perfect. Does that sound good to you? You get to be the thing you wanted to be in the first place, and I get to make sure you get kept that way. Instead of being my human slave, you’ll be my bona-fide pet dog. No getting out of it.”<br />
<br />
Aiden thought quickly. He didn’t expect to be put into this ultimatum. Is this the best he could do? Live out life as a slave to his sadistic roommate, or be a canine for the rest of his life?<br />
<br />
“Quickly,” Eric said. “Slave or dog? If you don’t choose, I could switch you back to being a cock…”<br />
<br />
“Okay!” Aiden spoke. “Make me your pet dog. I don’t care. I’ll love it!”<br />
<br />
Eric smiled. “I’m glad we could come to an agreement.” He sat down at the Chronivac and started to click around. “Enjoy your last moments on two feet, boy.”<br />
<br />
Aiden couldn’t believe it. As he stood, he was breathing his last breaths in human shape. He looked over at the screen of the Chronivac, becoming curious as to what Eric was doing. He walked over towards the computer.<br />
<br />
“Nope!” Eric said, stopping him. “You’re going to be a canine soon. Better get used to not having computer privileges.”<br />
<br />
“I just wanna see what you are doing,” Aiden said.<br />
<br />
“Soon, you will be what I am doing,” Eric said, snidely.<br />
<br />
Aiden’s stomach was full of butterflies. What was Eric going to do to him? Was he really about to give up his humanity to avoid being a dickless slave?<br />
<br />
“Okay,” the Chronivac chimed. “It looks like your program is complete! Initializing in three seconds.”<br />
<br />
It looked like Aiden’s time for second guessing was over.<br />
<br />
“It’s time, pup!” Eric said.<br />
<br />
Aiden felt a strange itching all over his skin. He looked at his hands as they shrunk and started to turn to paws. His legs followed along, lengthening and bending. A tail broke loose from his spine as he toppled over onto all fours.<br />
<br />
“Wow, this is working quickly,” Eric exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Aiden’s heart was beating quicker. He tried to talk as he felt his face smoosh into a muzzle. “This…this feels…greeeat. Grrrr!” His vocals were already changed beyond humanity.<br />
<br />
The changes continued as he shrunk down smaller. He looked down to see his genitals were reforming. Gladly he was a boy dog, the way he would have wanted it. His body had grown dark black hair all over, and it was getting longer as he was getting more compact.<br />
<br />
His ears shifted to the top of his head, he lost color vision in his eyes, his nose stretched forward and grew wet. He began to feel vibrant and free, involuntary panting as he changed.<br />
<br />
In under a minute, his change had ended. Even his collar had shrunk to his new size. He looked himself over as the Chronivac spoke.<br />
<br />
“Great, he’s a dog now,” it said. “Do you like him?”<br />
<br />
“He’s perfect,” Eric replied.<br />
<br />
As Aiden looked up at Eric, a sinking feeling set in. This wasn’t what he wanted. Scurrying on his paws, he fell as he started to get his new bearings. He heard Eric…his new master…laugh as he fell. But he kept going, feeling his short…his short legs!<br />
<br />
He finally got to the mirror where his worst fears were confirmed. He wasn’t the dog of his dreams. He was the tiniest of Schnauzers. This wasn’t what he wanted, he always wanted to be a German Shepard, something fast and big. Strong! Not a heel nipper!<br />
<br />
Almost involuntarily, Aiden let out his first doggie whine.<br />
<br />
“Oh, do I hear my new pup, complaining?” Eric shook his head as he stood above his former roommate. “Isn’t this exactly what you wanted?<br />
<br />
There wasn’t any way for Aiden to say that this wasn’t what he wanted! He just started to yip and whine, as that was all he could say.<br />
<br />
“I think I’ll just call you Pup from now on,” Eric said. “It certainly fits you now. I’ve made you a six month old pup so you’ll have a long time to live as my little dog. You’re one of my favorite breeds, perfect for an apartment pet.”<br />
<br />
Eric reached down to pick Pup up. He held him up in his arms and gave his former roommate a little peck.<br />
<br />
“So cute! We will have to go to the store and get you a doggie bowl, a leash, some toys. Hopefully you’ll find those fun, even with your human brain still intact.”<br />
<br />
“You can always change objects you already have into Pup’s new things. Might I suggest the myriad of objects in Aiden’s old bedroom?” The Chronivac piped up, settling into its role as Eric’s sidekick.<br />
<br />
“Aww, but that would deprive him of the experience! We will also need to get him chipped, vaccinated, and…oh dear,” Eric said, lifting Pup up to view his underbelly. “I forgot to take away his balls.”<br />
<br />
It was then that Pup fully realized how deep he was.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you don’t want to just make a few modifications,” the Chronivac asked. “A piece of art is never truly finished.”<br />
<br />
“Eh, no. I’ll pass for now,” Eric said, cuddling Pup. “He wanted to be my pet, and now he has to experience exactly what it is like to be a doggie. I’d hate to deprive him of what he always wanted.”</p>
