<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karen woke up early the next morning next to her wife, still a bit sore from the fucking last night. Nadia was still asleep, all eight of her heads resting in various spots across their hotel bed. Karen genitally removed the head laying on her stomach before she got up and made some coffee for herself. As she enjoyed the freshly brewed cup, she remembered the catalyst for the night of fun she had just experienced: the “aphrodisiacs” that she had received from two of her students. She was a bit surprised to find the conjoined sisters at the beach since it was a good distance outside the city, but the amazing sex as well as the chance to get more of those pills made the chameleon-woman incredibly thankful for their presence.<br />
<br />
	Karen looked over at her dozing wife. She knew it would be at least another hour before the lazy reptile was even awake, let alone willing to leave the warm bed, so Karen decided that she was going to walk around the hotel for a bit and “share&#39;&#39; some of the pills with people she met. She left the hotel room without even bothering to put on clothes, simply turning invisible before opening the door. Nadia often complained about her wife&#39;s refusal to wear anything most of the time, but had long since given up any meaningful attempt to change the exhibitionist&#39;s ways. As a kid, Karen loved using her ability to sneak around and play pranks, but since it couldn&#39;t make her clothes invisible she would often be scolded by adults for her nakedness when she was caught. This innocent love of pranks slowly morphed into an extreme sexual fetish as the woman grew into an adult, with Karen now only wearing clothing when necessary like when at school and while out shopping alone. At all other times she loved the excitement she got from being naked in public, her huge horsecocks constantly at full mast as she walked past unsuspecting strangers. Sometimes she would even press her shafts against people and watch their confused looks as their clothes were stained with her pre. A few times she lost control and came all over people, painting with lust as she ran away before she was caught by the soaked victim of her deviancy.<br />
<br />
	As Karen made her way down the halls, she heard shouting from around the corner. When she went to investigate she found a man and a woman standing beside each other outside an open door, dressed only in their underwear, while another woman, a look of anguish and fury on her face, shouted at them:<br />
<br />
	“YOU CHEATING BASTARD, I FOUND THE TEXT MESSAGES YOU&#39;VE BEEN SENDING TO THIS, THIS SUCCUBUS!”<br />
<br />
	The woman continued shouting while the man tried to make excuses. The other woman looked confused as the couple argued, possibly because she had not known about the man&#39;s other relationship.<br />
<br />
	Karen, hoping to perhaps deescalate the situation snuck over to the group and slipped a pill into each of their mouths, the sex-craved deviant believing anything can be resolved with sex. Convinced that her solution would work, the chameleon-woman stepped back and observed, completely oblivious to the transformations progressing in front of her.<br />
<br />
	The unknowing mistress&#39;s body began to swell, her petite five and a half foot frame stretching upwards as muscles grew larger all over her form. Soon the woman was a nearly seven foot tall giant with toned muscles just visible underneath her skin, which soon began to darken into a deep purple shade. Her breasts, originally a pair of cute B-cups soon became a pair of perky H-cups, with thumb-sized nipples and plate-sized areolas. A pair of upward curling ram-horns spiralled out of the sides of her head and her ears lengthened into points. Her shoulder length brunette hair became pitch black. Three lumps formed on her back, two on her shoulders and one on her tailbone, that then blossomed into a huge pair of bat-like wings and a long spaded tail respectively. Finally, a foot-long cock and a pair of apple-sized balls replaced her vagina.<br />
<br />
	Once her transformation finished her confused and scared look was replaced by a haughty, confident smirk, and she possessively grabbed the, now shorter than her, man around his shoulders as she interrupted the couples argument.<br />
<br />
	“Honey, if you didn&#39;t want to have your husband stolen then maybe you should have kept him on a tighter leash?”<br />
<br />
	At this point the man&#39;s transformation began, he shrunk from five foot nine to an even five feet tall, while his body became more petite and womanly. A pair of tiny A-cup cup breasts grew on his chest that were soon covered by his waist-length dirty-blond hair. Inside his boxers, the man&#39;s cock shrank to a tiny inch and a half, as his balls were pulled back inside him to be turned into a womb and ovaries connected to a tight vagina. While this was happening, the argument had shifted from being between him and his wife to between the two women.<br />
<br />
	“Oh don&#39;t you try to blame me for this, I made the decision to let him work as a secretary while I stayed home with the kids with the explicit orders to not submit to the first cock he set his eyes on.” shouted the wife, her own transformation beginning with a phallic bulge beginning to form underneath her skirt.<br />
<br />
	“I give him all the cock he needs at home, he doesn&#39;t need some demonic whore wearing out his holes!” As she continued her legs began to fuse into a fleshy, oval-shaped tube that started growing down the hallway.<br />
<br />
	“If he was getting enough cock from you then why has he been begging to suck me dry under my desk every day for the past month? Maybe you&#39;re not as fulfilling as you think, hmmmm? The succubus replied. She then reached her left hand into the man&#39;s boxers and pressed two of her fingers, the only two that didn&#39;t end in sharp nails, into his slit.<br />
<br />
	The man&#39;s wife watched her husband mewl under the other woman&#39;s touch, her growing erection tenting her skirt. Her penis wasn&#39;t the only thing growing however, as the tube that had once been her legs was now twice as long as her upper torso with no sign of stopping soon. Meanwhile, her upper body had begun to change as well. Her breasts grew to a generous F-cup while her hair grew to her widening hips, the colour transitioning from a dark brown to a bright red at the halfway point. While her changes continued on, the argument seemed to be changing directions.<br />
<br />
	“He has has he?” the wife asked, leaning forward to look her husband in the eye. Her husband blushed and turned his head away from his wife&#39;s piercing gaze. Taking that as confirmation, the wife ran one of her fingers, all but the middle and pointer on her right hand now capped with long crimson nails, under his chin.<br />
<br />
	“Then maybe my subby hubby is more needy than I thought...”<br />
<br />
	While the wife&#39;s anger cooled, the tube that had replaced her legs stopped growing at nine feet from her waist, and had begun the next step in it&#39;s transformation. Under the woman&#39;s skirt A large black chitinous plate formed around her hips, wrapping around her butt and lower back while leaving the front side of her body exposed, similar plates, each about half a foot long grew down the tube, covering the top half, while the bottom half was covered in thinner plates the same colour as her skin that began from just under her pussy and eight inch cock. These two rows of plates separated her lower body into eighteen sections. From each section, except the first one and the last one, pairs of long, insectoid legs grew, giving her sixteen total legs. From her head grew a pair of long, swept-back antennae while the back of her lower body grew a pair of legs that were parallel with itself. Now fully transformed into a centipede-taur the wife made a proposition with the succubus that she had been shouting at just minutes ago:<br />
<br />
	“If he really is that needy even at work, then I guess we can share him. But we would need to make this official and add you to the marriage, and you would need to help raise the kids, especially since you might have already knocked him up.”<br />
<br />
	It only took the succubus a moment to consider the terms given to her before giving her reply:<br />
<br />
	“That&#39;s acceptable, but if I&#39;m going to be part of your marriage, I think it&#39;s fair that I get to fuck you as well, don&#39;t you think?” As the succubus gave her terms, she used the hand not fingering the other woman&#39;s husband to fondle her erect cock.<br />
<br />
	“I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way”<br />
<br />
	With both parties in agreement, the succubus lifted the tiny man up into her arms, causing him to let out a cute feminine squeak, before returning to her hotel room, the centipede-taur skittering in after her.<br />
<br />
	Karen let out a satisfied sigh as she gave herself a mental pat on the back and wished the pair of doms well now that they had worked out their differences, completely convinced that all the pills had done was make them horny enough to realize that their sub could be shared between them.<br />
<br />
	With plenty of time left before her wife woke up and plenty of pills left, Karen continued down the hallway looking for the next person to use them on.</p>
