<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From what Tiff could tell could tell it looked like there was something a bit different under Katie's shirt. Unsure she decided to stay silent, after all it wasn't like she made a point of checking out her friends' bodies all the time.<br />
<br />
Katie shook violently as the feverish feeling passed, replaced by a sensation of pressure in her chest. Staggering free from Tiff's arms she brushed herself off and pulled at her shirt, &quot;That was weird, but I think I'm alright now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good, but let's take a break for a second any way. You had me scared there and I'm not ready to start looking around again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let's sit down over there,&quot; Katie gestured at a table and chairs as she wiggled her shoulders trying to get rid of the feeling in her chest. At first it had just been a pressure, but now it was like her bra was pressing up against her breasts.<br />
<br />
By the time they got down to the table and sat down Katie's bra was decidedly uncomfortable, &quot;Tiff, I know this sounds crazy, but I think that fruit made my breasts bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Tiff rolled her eyes, &quot;Are your sure your fever isn't back any you're delirious?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, really,&quot; Katie lifted her shirt to reveal that her bra was indeed to small. Both girls gasped and Katie took off her bra with a smile, &quot;How big do you think they are now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure unless you want me to take a closer look.&quot;<br />
<br />
For some reason this struck both of them as being incredibly funny and they laughed.<br />
<br />
Katie was the first to stop when she realized that the pressure wasn't gone from her breasts. In fact, they were starting to brush against her shirt ever so slightly. People were bound to notice such a drastic change and she didn't know how she'd explain it.<br />
<br />
Seeing Katie rubbing at her chest Tiff stopped laughing, &quot;What's wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they're still growing,&quot; not caring about modesty Katie lifted her shirt. Her breasts were a very well shaped B-cup now, closer to a C, and despite their size they hadn't begun to sag without support.<br />
<br />
Tiff hadn't taken too close a look to begin with so she wasn't as sure, &quot;Put your shirt back down. Let's see it that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
By the time Katie had her shirt in place her nipples were pressing out against the fabric, firm and erect even without stimulation. Shrugging her shoulders to make them jiggle Katie smiled slightly, &quot;They feel pretty nice so I guess I like them even if I will need to get all new bras.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not all you'll need,&quot; Tiff pointed to the bottom of Katie's shirt, bringing to her attention that her expanding cleavage had lifted the shirt up, revealing an inch of her stomach.<br />
<br />
Katie stopped wiggling long enough to look down, &quot;Now that you mention it, my shirt is kind of tight across my chest. I thought it might have just been me though, I'm not used to them after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn't just her, Katie realized that her breasts were now pressed tightly against her shirt, to the point where it was nearly uncomfortable for her erect nipples, &quot;Let's see if there's any hint of how big they're going to get or if there's anything we can do to make them a bit smaller.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing up made her breasts jiggle even more, though now it wasn't as pleasant due to the confines of her shirt which had been lifted by her breasts to the point where two inches of her stomach was visible. Still fascinated by having breasts she rubbed at them through her shirt, especially focusing on her nipples since they were so big and plump, just begging to be squeezed and played with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie, they're bigger than a D-cup now, let's get looking,&quot; Tiff rushed over to the refrigerator.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right behind you,&quot; Katie muttered, but didn't move. Her breasts were really pressed hard against her shirt and it didn't feel so good any more. It was a struggle to get it off, but when she did her breasts bounced free, gravity defyingly perky despite their obvious weight. Their movements held Katie enthralled, every breath she took made them heave and jiggle. Grinning she hugged her arms around her chest to feel their wonderful firmness. She could feel them growing as pressed her arms against them and tried to hold on for as long as possible before their growth forced her to loosen her grip. When that happened she went back to playing with her nipples, amazed at how big they were and how good it felt to squeeze them. Best of all was how easy they were to get a grip on, at least half an inch long and delightfully plump.<br />
<br />
Tiff, noticing that Katie hadn't followed her turned and let out a horrified shout.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Katie stopped playing with her nipples long enough to look at her friend before using her arms to push her breasts even further out, not that they needed it, &quot;Aren't they just great?&quot;<br />
<br />
To prove her point Katie flicked her now thumb sized nipples and jumped to make them shake even more, &quot;I had no idea it felt so good to have huge breasts. How much more do you think they'll grow? I just hope they don't stop too soon.&quot;</p>
