<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will shook his head anxiously, how could he have gotten himself into this situation. He waited for the bus to get to the stop, all the while thinking of the only option he had right now, to go home and wait till the morning when the shop would be open. The sound of the brakes from the bus screeching to a halt startled Will. He put his hand to his heart, feeling it beating quickly. Entering the bus slowly as the door opened, he paid the fare and took his seat in the mostly empty bus. Will sighed slightly, he couldn't believe how skittish he was now, his emotions were very strong as they continued to flood his thoughts. <br />
<br />
A few minutes had passed and Will was feeling a slight bit better, he'd reasoned with himself that it was logical to assume that this could be reversed just as easily as it had come about. He'd have the whole night to spend in the body of, lets face it, a hot young woman. He could survive a day without talking to Megan without suspicion of anything, there was no way he wanted to explain this until he knew he could return to normal or vice versa.<br />
<br />
Amongst his angst, the thought of having the body now seemed not so daunting a task. Finally the bus pulled to the last stop of the night, which was just a block down from his house thankfully. He stepped out with the rest of the passengers and immediately began walking toward his house. He felt a slight chill from the cool air as it blew through his loose sweatshirt, he shivered, rubbing his hands up and down his dainty arms. &quot;Why does it have to be so cold...this sucks...oh well, just a little ways to go...&quot; He shivered slightly, he wasn’t used to getting so cold, normally he’d be fine, but he'd never yell at Megan for not bringing an spare coat ever again that’s for sure.<br />
 <br />
Will walked up to his apartment entryway. &quot;Finally...that only felt like forever...&quot; His voice sounded soft and caring even though he'd not meant it to sound that way in the slightest. A smile crossed his face, he was almost hotter than Megan, man would she kill him just for looking at a girl like the one he’d possessed. He reached into the pocket of his pants, he felt nothing...emptiness, and he frantically searched for his apartment keys, there was nothing. &quot;Shit!&quot; His soft voice sounds foolish when swearing. He must've left them on the bus, his panic was growing, and there wasn't any way to get in. &quot;No one's going to let me in...&quot; Who would let in a stranger...<br />
 <br />
The bus station was a few miles away but they'd all be gone when he got there. He couldn't do anything, he kicked the ground angrily, missing the ground completely he kicked off his shoe accidentally, flinging it somewhere into the darkness. &quot;Damnit, could this night get any worse...&quot; He huffed, on the verge of tears, he had no choice but to call someone, he'd be a Popsicle (oddly cold for the season) if he was made to stay out there. He tossed the other shoe into the darkness in frustration, not willing to search for the lost one. &quot;I'll go barefoot then!&quot;<br />
 <br />
Another frustrating move by Will was leaving his cell inside his apartment, he made his way to the nearest payphone he knew of, looking cautiously around. He grabbed the phone, checking for the dial tone, satisfied, he reached into his pocket for some change. He pulled out 50 cents. &quot;Shit, only enough for one call...damnit...who'll believe me more.&quot; It was between his best friend, Jake and his girlfriend Megan. Both he felt confident that he'd convince them of his validity, but each had their down side. Megan while she'd be able to deal with him as a girl, would also see it as an opportunity to teach Will a lesson on respecting the female form more. <br />
<br />
While Jake, his only real issue would be his girlfriend/fianc&eacute;e Debbie, don't take that the wrong way, she was a perfect girlfriend and always nice to Will and Megan both. But, if she felt threatened in any fashion from another woman, her claws came out. But Jake's dad had set him up with a nice 'little' place for their wedding gift, a grand house with a guesthouse to boot. The place had all the amenities, though he'd only heard about it, never having the opportunity to see it. Jake had his spare keys, it was a win-win situation...he'd just have to avoid Debbie, it would be difficult to convince her of anything this outlandish. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jake it is then...&quot; He entered the number slowly from memory, making sure he didn't mess it up somehow. &quot;Please deposit 50 cents for three minutes.&quot; The operator toned out, Will did so and waited a second, hearing the phone ringing. &quot;Fantastic, now I just need to convince him I'm his best bud turned female...that sounds easy.&quot; He waited while the phone rang a few times, he grew nervous that no one would answer, but soon he heard the receiver pick up. &quot;Hello?&quot; Came the familiar voice of his friend. <br />
<br />
Will grew excited slightly, finally a turn of good luck. &quot;Jake!? It's me!&quot; Silence briefly, Jake retorted. &quot;Um...who's this...I don't&quot; Will interrupted. &quot;It's me Will, you gotta help me man, I'm having a rough night!&quot; Jake chuckled slightly on the other end. &quot;This some sort of sorority prank or something?&quot; &quot;Who is it honey?&quot; Jake said, followed by Debbie inquiring in the background, no doubt due to his statement. &quot;NO!&quot; Will yelled sternly into the phone. &quot;It's me, and if you want your little escapades at the strip clubs to remain between you and I, you'll listen!&quot; Will heard silence on the other end, but knew he had Jake's attention now. <br />
&quot;Remember back when we were eight, we were at your cousins house and we sneaked upstairs and into the bathroom while she was taking a shower?&quot; Will spoke softly into the phone, he knew only the two of them knew of it. &quot;Oh shit...Will...hold on.&quot; He heard shuffling and muffled voices as he left the room he was in. &quot;Will? What happened?&quot; Jake asked, having realized that they'd sworn not to mention it to anyone, no matter what, it had to be Will, but what on Earth could make that possible, he wondered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know...I'll explain what I do know, later, I need you to come pick me up, I locked myself out of my place, I'm at a payphone near my apartment. Hurry, please, I'm kinda nervous here, it's really dark.&quot; Will pleaded, he heard Jake laughing a little. &quot;Okay, but I want something in return...after I get a look at you...&quot; Will's face grew annoyed as he was about to retort to his friend when he heard the click. He put the phone on the hook. &quot;Better not be something dirty...&quot; He sighed, crossing his arms under his chest, leaning against the nearby wall, he looked down at his chilling feet. &quot;Hurry up Jake!&quot; <br />
<br />
Having made up an excuse that Will had gotten a flat out on the highway, Debbie lovingly kissed him goodbye and to tell Will she said hi. Jake was smirking the whole way, he couldn't believe his best bud had been turned into a chick. &quot;She sounded pretty attractive...but then again that could mean anything.&quot; He pressed the brake as he slowed down, coming up on Will's street, Jake looked around for the supposed girl, figuring it could just be an elaborate prank. Soon though he saw a gorgeous girl by the side of the street, she was perfect, and thoughts of her in various stages of undress flooded his mind. Certainly he was a one-woman man but this girl was stunning and very tempting. He slowly pulled up to her, rolling the window down. &quot;No way...Will is that really you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Will saw the car pulling up, recognizing Jake's flashy Mercedes immediately, Will made his way over to the curb. He was cold to the bone and had begun shivering, it took Jake a good ten minutes to make it to his apartment. Will pulled on the handle, and immediately got into the car, the seat warmer had been turned on already and he felt it immediately on his soft, chilled rear. He looked Jake as sternly in the eye as he could, he was in no mood for any mischief. &quot;Of course it's me, jerk, you take the scenic route or something?&quot; Will blushed, Jake had been staring with his mouth wide open from the moment he got in. <br />
<br />
Jake was staring into those beautiful blue orbs as they looked directly into his own. She was perfect, petite, and angelic, her beautiful face was mesmerizing, he couldn't look away. She was adorable as she shivered there, Jake realized his gaze and just nodded. &quot;Sorry, lights...&quot; Shaking his head from his daze. &quot;So, wait, how is this possible...I thought this was some kind of joke, but...I'm convinced...&quot; Will reached into his pocket, handing the vial over to Jake. &quot;It's this stuff, I spilled some of it on me, and bam an hour or so later I'm the girl next door. All I know is, I ran into a jogger...&quot; Will made a gesture to himself. &quot;I guess she must've looked similar, but I think it's an enhanced version cuz she didn't look this good...&quot; <br />
<br />
Looking over the vial for a moment, Jake put it into his pocket. &quot;I'll hold onto it, there's some words in a language I don't recognize, going to look it up. I'll get it back to you once I know what they said. I'm sorry this has happened man, but you got me, I'll help you out. You can stay in the guest house till we get the keys tomorrow...&quot; <br />
<br />
Will shot Jake a glare. &quot;What do you mean, get the keys, you should have them!&quot; His voice sounding frustrated. &quot;Well, remember your birthday? I gave Megan the keys cuz she said she'd lost hers and needed the set to set up your party, so we have to get them from her...&quot; Jake said nodding honestly. Will sighed, but nodded understandingly. &quot;Fine! What else could go wrong...I might as well go to the bus stop and see if they got them turned in then.&quot;<br />
 <br />
A smirk crossed Jake's face, he put the car into park. &quot;Well, now it's my turn, I'm helping you out...all I'm asking for is a free glimpse at that nice little body you've got. Otherwise, you can just get out right now and go over to Megan's by yourself, though I doubt she'll be as believing as I am.&quot; Will just looked at Jake, it wasn't unusual for them to dare each other to do outrageous things in public/private, wherever, not surprising Will that some kind of mild humiliation was always involved with Jake's assistance. A personal pride of Will's was he never turned down a dare, though in his new situation he considered forgoing his pride...briefly. &quot;Fine...what is it, just take it easy, please?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Okay...nothing too demeaning, just want you to take off your bra and sweatshirt for three minutes while I record it.&quot; Jake stated pulling out his phone. &quot;C'mon it's not even your body, you'll be back to normal by tomorrow, I'm sure you want to look at 'em as much as I do.&quot; Jake said stroking Will's love of the female body, and it seemed to be having an affect. Certainly if he’d been able to be turned into a girl, he’d be able to return to his male self, so why not take advantage of it. “Fine, but only three minutes, and no touching!” Will said as sternly as is soft voice could muster. Will saw Jake smirk as he put the car in gear. “You got it…babe, first light, you have to be stripped by the first light or I get to see the whole package…” He chuckled seeing Will’s reaction as they pulled away from Will’s apartment.<br />
<br />
Will had work his arms into his shirt, managing with a bit of effort to get his bra off without taking his sweatshirt off. Though he admitted that Megan made it seem so simple in the past. Will’s nipples had become erect from the cool outside air, now they shown poking against the material of his shirt. “Man you’re a real jackass ya know, I should drop some of that stuff on you and see how you like…” Will stated, ending his sentence as he saw the first light. Promptly taking the sweatshirt off in one quick tug, tossing it to the floor in front of him. Feeling the still strange weight on his chest jiggle as his arms slowly went to his side. Will’s eyes slowly looked up to Jake, who had been smiling the whole time, now, however, his mouth was wide open as he openly gawked.<br />
<br />
The girl before Jake was phenomenal, her perky round c-cups hung beautifully. The skin was invitingly soft and despite his earlier promise, he felt the urge to grab them. Deciding that safety was paramount, he continued to record as he drove. “At least pretend like you’re liking this, I can at least get it on a site or two!” Jake whispered, Will sighed hesitantly. “Or I’ll boot your ass out the door as you are!” Will shook his head before he started to smile as though he was into it. They pulled up to a light where a group of guys in a jeep could clearly see into the car. Once one noticed it quickly spread to his buddies, all of them began to cheer. “Oh shit…” Will spoke, seeing the guys behind him, still pretending to be enjoying himself, he waved. They began to chant for more, so Will squeezed his boobs together for them and the camera to see, tweaking his quarter size nipples. “Now get us the hell out of here…this is too much…” Jake was distracted by the show briefly, he shook his head to focus his thoughts. “Fine…fine…” He floored it as soon as it turned green. <br />
<br />
	Three minutes went by quickly and Will was actually laughing when Jake swerved back and forth on the road. “Aw, how cute, someone’s in love…hope Debbie doesn’t find out, she’ll kill us both!” They laughed, knowing that was actually quite close to the truth. Will slipped the sweatshirt back on, for the first time being able to enjoy himself since he’d begun his transformation. “I guess it’s not so bad, the shop was still there, it didn’t magically disappear or anything, I can be myself by noon. Thanks for being so cool with this, I’d be going crazy if it weren’t for you.” Will smiled sweetly, smacking him in the arm. “But we’re even now.”<br />
<br />
	A pleased smile was plaster on Jake’s face. “Ahh…I guess, and no problem…bro…heh. Sorry Will, this is just weird, don’t know what to call you. But you know I’ll always be there for ya, and the fact that you’re a hot chick helped.” He chuckled. “Happy to help a lady in distress.” Jake winked, making sure he knew he was just playing around. “Aw, prince charming…how sweet…cornball!” Will said with a laugh, watching Jake turn the headlights off as they pulled into the drive. He made sure to just coast without hitting the pedal. “We’ll have to keep this as quiet as we can, Debbie still thinks I’m out on the highway with you and there’s no way that’d take twenty minutes. She should be asleep by now though.” Jake spoke to Will, pulling up to the garage.<br />
<br />
	Turning the ignition off, Jake looked to Will. “Alright, we’ll get you settled over there, don’t slam any doors, come around to my side of the car and grab my hand. Can’t turn any lights on and I know this place like the back of my hand.” Will didn’t like the idea of holding Jake’s hand but it beat getting caught by Debbie. “Okay…” They both got out of the car, Will made sure he grabbed everything. Walking around the car, and as soon as he grabbed Jake’s much larger and firmer hand, he felt Jake leading him as they quickly walked to the path leading to the Guest/Pool House behind the main one. The outside pool was shutdown for cleaning, but fortunately for Jake he had a smaller, but still nice, one inside the guesthouse.<br />
<br />
	Will knew full well how wealthy Jake’s family was and to them all this was just a drop in the puddle. It hadn’t always been that way, when they were kids, both their family’s had been middle class, but Jake’s father had invested in the right things and struck it big. They reached the Guesthouse, immediately Jake unlocked the door and walked in, quietly closing the door behind them. Will let go of Jake’s hand now able to see, the pool house was always dimly lit. Walking past the pool, Will shook his head. “This must be nice…not one, but two pools! Though I have to admit, I like this one for the privacy.” Will smirked, knowing Jake’s exploits in that very pool. <br />
<br />
	Jake just laughed. “Yeah yeah, what can I say, use what you got, ya know?” They walked up to the stairs to the bedroom that was a loft above the pool. It gave a perfect view of the whole pool area, it could be blocked off with curtains that hung from the ceiling, but mostly it was very open. A closet was the only recessed area in the loft. “Okay so you know that Eva usually sleeps here every other month, so she keeps a lot of her clothes here. You look around her size, so wear what you like, I don’t think she’ll miss it.” Eva was Debbie’s little sister, she wasn’t the nicest person on the planet, but she was very beautiful, in her early 20’s, great figure. Will sighed, realizing they were very similar now. “You’re not expecting her anytime soon are you?” Will asked, acting as though he feared her.<br />
<br />
	“Nah, you’ll be fine, she’s not supposed to be here for another week, you should be long gone by then.” Jake said confidently. “Okay, restroom and shower are downstairs on the left. Don’t worry that has a four walls with a door that locks, heh. Kitchen is on the right, there’s plenty of food for you.” He pointed to the plasma on the wall. “You know how to use that I’m sure, feel free to take a dip in the pool. You know the game lounge is downstairs straight down the hall, do what you like man, my place is yours.” He stood. “If you need me, the phone’s downstairs, it’s a separate line from the house. So call my cell.”<br />
<br />
	Will just nodded, walking over to the bed, he plopped down, the feeling of his chest bouncing slightly as he did. “Oh this is all just so weird…why does this crazy shit always happen to me?” Will sighed, sitting up, and looking over to Jake who was just watching him. “What?” Jake shrugged slightly. “Well…can I see…all of that body? C’mon man, if I was in your place I’d totally let you…I’ll give you a grand…you don’t even have to do anything…I just want to look.”<br />
<br />
	Thinking for a moment, Will sighed, he definitely needed the money. “Man you’re annoying…but I can’t pass up a grand, fine. But like before, no touching! I know how to take you down no matter how big a man you think you are…” Will stood from the soft plushy bed, his hands grabbed the buttons of Megan’s, now his, jeans. He slinked them down his soft legs, taking off the socks along with them. Standing in just the sweatshirt and panties, Will shook his head once more. “Better pay up…” He pulled the sweatshirt over his head, throwing it to the bed. He placed his hands on his hips as his chest now bare once more, leaving the panties on, he wasn’t quite ready to show him all of that. “I need a bit to get comfortable, I’m not ready…”<br />
<br />
	Jake stood up, towering over his diminished friend. “You’re like 5’5” now…I didn’t notice how short you are…sexy little thing.” The large C-cup stood out pertly, like two grapefruits that wanted to be squeezed. Jake reached his hand out. “I’m just going to point something out on your belly…promise no foul play.” He pointed to Will’s navel where a hole was. “You’ve got a belly piercing…and that’s not all…looks like your right nipple has a hole for one too. Looks like this jogger chick had a thing for it and I gotta say I’m into that.” Will looked down at himself, he hadn’t seen those earlier, his right hand felt the one above his belly button. Not having realized that Jake had said he was 2” shorter than earlier.<br />
<br />
 	While Will was distracted by the new found piercing his body possessed, Jake walked around Will, his butt was pushed out in a very feminine fashion, covered only by the thin layer of cotton. Jake shrugged with a mischievous smirk, wrapping his fingers around the band of Will’s panties, yanking them down in one quick motion, he got a clear view of Will’s round behind. “You took too long, so I thought I’d help…wow, what a great body…and I love tan lines on a girl, very sexy.” Jake’s eyes studied every inch of Will’s nudity, the girl obviously didn’t go o’natural. Will was just standing still, a little embarrassed by his sudden nakedness. Jake came around so they were face to face, looking down at the trimmed strip of hair between his legs. “Wow man, I don’t know, it’s a rare opportunity to be on the other side…well…thanks for the view…I’ll let you enjoy your time as a girl.” He winked one of his sparkling blue eyes at Will. Jake had to adjust his pants when his excitement became uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
	Watching Jake leave, Will just stood there completely naked, Will blushed, he was suddenly very aware that he had been aroused by Jake’s actions, starting with him stripping off the panties. “Oh shit…I hope I don’t like men now…yuck…” Chills ran down his body, he felt grimy still from earlier. Looking down to his dirty feet, he sighed. “I guess I need to take a shower anyway.” Will decided not to grab clothes because it was just down the stairs. He cupped his breasts to keep the jiggling to a minimum as he walked down the stairs. Slowly he peered around, making certain he was the only one there, confirming it he casually walked across the pool room to the bathroom. Closing the door behind him, Will sighed, flicking the light switch. The cool tile sending more chills through his body, he tiptoed over to the shower, it was a stand up with a sliding door. Will quickly slid it open, turning on the water, testing it with his delicate hand before closing the door.<br />
<br />
	Making his way over to the toilet, Will lifted the seat and relaxed, feeling the liquid pour out in a very foreign fashion. He’d held it as long as he could until he had no choice but to go, once finished he wiped himself. “That was weird experience number sixty-seven for today…certainly not the last.” He smiled slightly, it felt kind of good to make light of the situation if only briefly. Stepping into the shower, Will closed the door as he went under the soothing warm water. The sensation of the water hitting his skin felt similar but still different than normal, allowing the warmth to envelop him completely. <br />
<br />
“Finally…” Will was finally able to relax now that things were somewhat taken care of, all he had to do now was ask the old man how to swap back. “I only hope it’s that simple.” He sighed; closing his eyes as the water ran down his soft-featured-face, running a hand through his hair as he, seemingly expertly, smoothed out his wet hair behind him. Looking down at his young feminine body, Will was slightly frightened at the thought of touching anything. Worried more by the thought that he might actually like any feelings they brought forth. “Still, what the hell…I didn’t ask to be trapped in this body, I’m sure as hell going to enjoy it…stupid old man never said anything like this could happen…” He said in a frustrated tone, but once more his attempt at sounding assertive failed.<br />
<br />
Taking his right hand, Will studied his right breast, looking at the small hole through the nipple. “I can’t believe I missed that earlier…well not that I was really looking…” With the one on above his navel, they made for a pretty enticing image, he wouldn’t mind seeing it before giving up the body. His finger’s traced down the thin strip of pubic hair. “This girl knows how to tease a guy, that’s for sure.” Still, he thought about how it would look without the hair, he felt a tingle from between his legs. “Well at least it feels like I like girls still.” His finger tracing further down to his new soft mound, as he massaged the sensitive lips, that alone sent shivers through his spine. “That’s waaayyy to much for right now.” He definitely wasn’t ready for that just yet.<br />
<br />
Looking around the shower, he noticed there was a wide assortment of feminine products, all for Eva and all the best a girl could ever want. “I still got the short end of this friendship.” He smirked, grabbing the body wash, opening the top, he got a whiff of the contents. “Figures…” The product was cucumber melon, it reeked of all that was girly. He quickly washed himself with the loufa, making sure to clean every inch, with his face lastly. Rinsing off the soapiness. He finished off with using the equally feminine shampoo and conditioner, he turned the water off. Will walked to the edge of the shower, opening the door, he looked around for a moment before finding where they hid the towels.<br />
<br />
Again on instinct (or body memory), Will dried himself quickly, wrapping the towel around his still wet hair and another around his chest. “Dang, I’m a little too good at using this body…I’m freaking myself out.” He made his way out of the bathroom, feeling a little chill from the changing temperature, walking back up the stairs. Will took the towel from his head, drying it as best he could before he threw both towels into the hamper in the closet. He looked around for a bit inside the closet, trying to find some suitable sleepwear. Unfortunately it seemed that Eva was a bit of a minx, she had a wide assortment of sexy outfits. There were dozens of mini-skirts, dresses, camisoles, and baby-dolls, you name it. And the least revealing yet modest outfit was a French maid’s uniform. “Self-absorbed much. Doesn’t she wear anything normal ever?” <br />
<br />
Will thought briefly about tying out a few outfits, but he was beyond tired, between the transformation and being locked out of his apartment, he just wanted sleep. He grabbed the discarded sweatshirt, slipping it over his head, it covered down to his mid-thigh, he always thought Megan was sexy when she wore only that to bed.
