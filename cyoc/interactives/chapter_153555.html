<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A gasp escaped her lips and she realized that her voice sounded somewhat deep yet still feminine. Was it because of her neck?<br />
<br />
“Doo dee, doo duh, all do-duh day…” she muttered before coughing. “This is so weird.”<br />
<br />
Nothing else happened, much to her relief. If she wanted to know what the hell was going on with her and what was in these dragon kebabs, she’ll have to look it up. The Internet would do nicely.<br />
<br />
Lian stood up on her feet and walked over to her desk. The claws ripped her carpet floor, and she lamented that she’ll have to hire a carpenter for this. What would she tell them? That she sheltered a stray cat that scratched up the floor?<br />
<br />
She imagined herself walking on her toes barefoot on the pavement as if it either hot or cold. Aside from her heels being longer, she managed to reach her desk without any problem. But she had to be careful with her claws, figuring that she might break something easily. Tentatively, she pressed the power button on her computer with her knuckle. As silly as it was, it worked. She couldn’t help but smile as the computer hummed to life.<br />
<br />
Lian sat down and scooted in her tail so it would hang down behind her chair. As she logged in, she opened her browser and typed in ‘dragon kebab’ gently, only to find the page that came up with millions of results. Holding down the Shift key, she put the words into quotes, narrowing the results.<br />
<br />
“So far, so good,” she said to no one as she scrolled down the page. One headline had caught her attention.<br />
<br />
Mystery meat linked to sudden disappearances<br />
<br />
“Bingo.”<br />
<br />
She could barely get through the first paragraph before her body started to feel odd again. She pushed her chair back, bringing herself back in front of the mirror. There, she caught sight of the scales spreading up to her neck and up past her abdomen. Her belly button was nowhere to be seen. The last of her hair had fallen, leaving her bald with her horns continuing to grow and curve out of her forehead.<br />
<br />
“No. Not now. Please,” she whimpered.<br />
<br />
Her pleas were ignored as the scales spread up her chest and back. Her breasts shrunk, causing her bra to slip down. Her chest barreled outward in a triangular fashion, leaving behind a reminder of her humanity. Soon, the gray scales enveloped her face, and her eyes stung, forcing her to close them. Tears welled up and traveled down her face as she clutched her head together. Opening her eyes again, everything around her was more colorful, vibrant. Was that how lizards see ultraviolet light?<br />
<br />
She blinked several times, adjusting to the new lighting. She looked at the mirror and saw her eyes were entirely blue, her pupils having been shaped into slits.<br />
<br />
But it was not over yet.<br />
<br />
Her mouth and nose pushed forward, forming and merging into a snout. Instinct kicking in, Lian used both of her hands to push against it, hoping that would stop it somehow. Tried as she might, it was to no avail.<br />
<br />
She heard something snapped and landed with a thud. Turning her neck, which grew longer, she stared at her tail as it grew longer and thicker, dragging on the floor behind her. The back of her chair was snapped off and laid on the floor.<br />
<br />
Her eyes shot wide open as her shoulders grew wide, her bra snapping off her chest. No doubt the wings would come next, as two appendages emerged. In no time, they began to form the foundations of the wings, the membranes coming next.<br />
<br />
The rest of her chair collapsed, and she fell with a yelp. Dazed for a second, she wondered what happened, only to have that answered immediately.<br />
<br />
Lian’s heart throbbed wildly as her body twitched and convulsed. She looked as muscles all over her body began to swell. Her lithe body was bulking up as if something was being pumped into her body. At first, it led to a more toned body, the abs on her stomach and the pecs on her chest pushing forward to support her now large wings, her arms and legs growing thicker to support her tail. Everything around her started to look and feel small. It felt like her head was being pulled further away and her belly taut, stretched like putty.<br />
<br />
Lian crawled onto her bed and laid at her side. She thrashed about as she grew larger and thicker, tearing the blankets apart. Through her whimpers, she let out a snarl as her neck grew and thicken like the rest of her body. The bed creaked and moaned under her increasing weight until, eventually, the frame collapsed with a heavy thud.<br />
<br />
Finally, it stopped. Her body relaxed, and she laid on the remains of her bed for several agonizing minutes. Her chest heaved in and out, taking in deep and long breathes.<br />
<br />
There has to be more to it, she thought.<br />
<br />
But there was nothing.<br />
<br />
She sighed and let out a small laugh, her voice even deeper with a slight animalistic growl to it. She stood up, her horns barely just touching the ceiling. Looking at herself in the surprisingly intact mirror, she found herself to be built like a goddamn powerhouse. Arnold Schwarzenegger would be proud of her, to say the least.<br />
<br />
She flexed her arms and their bulges were the size of a basketball. She turned around to see her tail swishing, more than long enough for it to be on the ground. Her legs were large enough for her to crush three watermelons in one go. The ridges on her back were even larger, with spikes having been formed on the tips of her wings and in parallel to the ridges. Looking further down, she noticed a shorter toe on each of her heels.<br />
<br />
“So that’s where my pinky toes went,” she remarked. She cleared her throat, still not used to how deep it was.<br />
<br />
Not only was she incredibly built, but she was also much taller. She even had to lean down to get a good look. Before the transformation, she stood at an average height for a woman of her age. Now Lian stood about seven and a half feet tall, her long neck and horns included. Her wings were quite massive. If she unfolded them, they would have quite the impressive wingspan. She doubted she would in her room without hitting the walls or breaking them, though. Her scales were thick enough to act as her armor. They were also flexible enough to not hinder her mobility, as she had moved her arms and tail around.<br />
<br />
The more Lian thought about it, the harder it was for her to resist smiling, her mouth stretching across her maw. She felt rejuvenated. She felt powerful. If it wasn’t for her looking like a dragon standing on her two digitigrade legs, she wouldn’t mind having the body of a, well, bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
Then it hit her. She hoped she could still type on her computer at this size. Before she knew it, her stomach growled. The last time she ate was that kebab from earlier today.</p>
