<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fido and Michael’s sexy time session was interrupted up by a loud banging on the door. <br />
<br />
“Michael!” the voice yelled. “Open up! What did I tell you about leaving the door closed in you room?”<br />
<br />
“Dad!” Michael yelled back. “I’m busy in here doing my business. I need some privacy.”<br />
<br />
“You can do your business in the bathroom!” his father yelled back. “Now open up!”<br />
<br />
“Oh shit” Michael thought to himself as he got his shirt back on and Fido yipped.<br />
<br />
Michael urged Fido to move under his bed as Michael went to the door to open it. On the other side of the door, Michael’s father looked extremely angry. His face was a bright, bright shade of red. <br />
<br />
“I heard noises in there, Michael! What was going on in there? Achoo!”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father sneezed several times in a row as Michael got nervous as to what his reaction would be. <br />
<br />
“Michael! Is there a dog in your room?!”<br />
<br />
“Uh” Michael quickly tried to decide how to answer the answer. “No.”<br />
<br />
“Let me look in there!”<br />
<br />
“Dad” Michael tried to gently place his hand on his father’s chest before being pushed out of the way. “Maybe you should come back in here later. Your allergies are all acting up…”<br />
<br />
“Achoo!”<br />
<br />
“…and maybe you should let me clean up my room first before you go snooping around.”<br />
<br />
“Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!”<br />
<br />
“Dad?”<br />
<br />
Under the bed, Fido began to shake nervously as his tail wagged back and forth rapidly. Although he had met Michael’s father only a few times before, he knew he could be an angry man and one with a short fuse and a hot temper. It was the Italian in him. Freddy had to admit that, with some guilt, he really thought Michael’s father was extremely sexy. He had a very furry chest and muscles that were built up from his years as a semi-professional wrestler. He was tough as nails and Freddy thought it was alluring and intimidating at the same time. Unfortunately, he didn’t want him to caught in this form and certainly not right now. <br />
<br />
Michael’s father continued to search through his room as he was urged to leave; pleas that were ignored. Finally, Michael’s father got to the bed and went to look under it. <br />
<br />
“Dad?” Michael asked nervously. “Can you please come back later?”<br />
<br />
Before his father could say anything, he spotted Fido, the German Shepherd dog, shaking nervously and looking up at his boyfriend’s father in fear. His tail was wagging and he whimpered repeatedly. <br />
<br />
“Michael!!!!!” his father yelled with a big, booming voice. “Achoo! What did I tell you about having a dog in the house?!”<br />
<br />
“Dad” Michael replied nervously, trying to motion Fido to get up. “I wanted to wait to tell you this until later, but Freddy’s family found this stray dog and they can’t keep him anymore so they asked me to look after him until….”<br />
<br />
“Achoo!”<br />
<br />
Michael’s father sneezed a million times over, as his rage further boiled up to the service. His strong, Italian, chiseled face, covered with a noticeable black scruff, was red as a tomato. <br />
<br />
“Michael! Get this dog out of my house right this second! And if I catch this dog in here again…Achoo! I will ground you for a week!”<br />
<br />
“Dad” Michael said, trying to plead with his father. “Please hear me out.”<br />
<br />
“Achoo! No! Out! Now!!!!!”<br />
<br />
Fido began to growl as Michael smacked him on the snout, causing him to whimper as he began to trot out of the room. Michael’s father chased him and Fido out of the house as his mother came running in from the living room. <br />
<br />
“What’s going on, dear?” his mother asked. <br />
<br />
“Achoo!” his father sneezed again. “Michael brought a dog into the house! Achoo!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, Michael”<br />
<br />
“Mom, Freddy’s parents asked me to watch it and I have no place left to keep him.”<br />
<br />
“Achoo!”<br />
<br />
“Well, try to ask one of your other friends to look after him for a while, dear. You know you can’t have a dog in the house. Your father is deathly allergic.”<br />
<br />
“Achoo!”<br />
<br />
“Mom, please.”<br />
<br />
“Michael!” his father yelled. “Out! Now! And don’t come back until that dog is far away from my house! Achoo!”<br />
<br />
“Michael, listen to your father please.”<br />
<br />
Fido whimpered as Michael motioned him to follow him out of the door. As they left, Michael’s father yelled to them.<br />
<br />
“And remember! Achoo! If I catch that dog in my house again, you’re grounded for a week! Grounded for a week!!!!”<br />
<br />
When the boy and dog left, Michael’s mother confronted her husband. <br />
<br />
“What’s with the hysterics, Ralph?”<br />
<br />
“Achoo! Irene! You know…Achoo! You know that I’m allergic to dogs.”<br />
<br />
“Your allergies don’t trigger your anger like this.”<br />
<br />
“Clean up his room, Irene! I might start breaking out into hives! Achoo!”<br />
<br />
“Fine, Ralph, I’ll clean up, but when I’m done, we need to talk about sending you to anger management classes.”<br />
<br />
“Achoo!”<br />
<br />
As Michael’s mother cleaned up the house and tried to console her husband, Michael walked with Fido a number of blocks away from the house. <br />
<br />
“Oh man” Michael said aloud. “I have no idea where I can go to turn you back into a human now. We’re totally stuck.”<br />
<br />
Fido whimpered as Michael sat down on the sidewalk. In a fit of panic, Fido began licking at Michael’s face hoping to get him to start thinking about a back up plan to their predicament. <br />
<br />
“Calm down, Freddy, and let me think.”<br />
<br />
Michael put his head down to ponder some ideas while Fido sprawled out across his lap and looked up at him. <br />
<br />
“Would you mind giving me space, Freddy?”<br />
<br />
With a whimper, Fido got up and sat next to Michael, rubbing his furry body into his shoulder. <br />
<br />
“I guess that’s fine.”<br />
<br />
Michael ruminated over some ideas. He crossed off a number of things before he narrowed it down to two ideas. One was the dog park. If Michael could get to the dog park, he would hope that the stray female bitch in heat was still there so that Michael could get Fido off enough to cum. If need be, he’d even let him breed her again, as much as he didn’t want to entertain the thought. <br />
<br />
The other idea was heading to an abandoned house about a mile down the road. It was way out of the way, but it was secluded enough that it guaranteed privacy for the two of them and insured that he could masturbate Fido in peace. <br />
<br />
Michael thought for a moment and then decided…</p>
