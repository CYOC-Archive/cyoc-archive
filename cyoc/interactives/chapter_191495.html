<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So in short, our messed up son put me in his ex girlfriend’s body so that she could live as a man and I’d be shit outta luck,” Rico finished explaining to his wife Lydia. He was stuffing his feminine face with bacon, eggs and toast.<br />
<br />
“That’s insane! So you’re my real husband in that twenty year-old girl’s body?? I guess that’s why your original body told me that he’s gay and wants a divorce,” said Lydia, putting the pieces of the puzzle together.<br />
<br />
“That little brat said that to you?? Boy she’s moving fast to take my life. We gotta move faster. If you can distract Anthony for long enough, I think I can sneak in and use whatever machine mumbo jumbo to switch me back into my male body,” planned Rico.<br />
<br />
“You got it sweetie. I can’t live with my husband being a younger, prettier woman than myself, after all,” said Lydia in agreement.<br />
<br />
Lydia and Rico finished their meal at the diner looking more like a mother and daughter than a husband and wife. Lydia called Anthony, telling him that his grandpa was in life threatening danger and that they needed to meet at his grandpa’s house to go to the hospital together. Anthony trusted his mother to some degree and immediately headed to his grandpa’s house. Meanwhile, Rico made his was to Anthony’s house.<br />
<br />
Rico got to Anthony’s house and broke in by picking the lock. He found the machine in the basement responsible for switching his and Andrew’s bodies. He saw that some parts were missing but was able to find them in Anthony’s lame hiding places. He reassembled the machine and targeting his former body and his current body he performed a switch that was set to go off in fifteen minutes. That gave him enough time to get out of the house so that Andrew couldn’t just switch them right back.<br />
<br />
Rico got as far away from Anthony’s house as he could in those fifteen minutes. Suddenly, he found himself back at his old house, in his original body.<br />
<br />
“Thought you could outsmart me,” Rico laughed to himself.<br />
<br />
He was on the couch watching tv in his blue robe and some sort of underwear that was making him uncomfortable. He opened the robe to see his wife’s panties! Not only that, but his package looked even smaller than normal. In fact...it looked nonexistent.<br />
<br />
Rico ran to the bathroom to access his manhood. He lowered the panties that Andrew had dressed him in. Lo and behold, there was a vagina where his two inch penis and balls were supposed to be! Rico recognized it as the one he just had in Andrew’s,(formerly Andrea’s) body. He must’ve messed up with that body swapping machine. Rico was horrified and furious. Here he was supposed to be reclaiming his spot as a man but was lacking what he saw as the most essential part.<br />
<br />
Rico spotted his son Tom walk past the bathroom and shouted, “Hey! Get back here! Did you help put that Andrea girl in my body??”<br />
<br />
Tom came into the bathroom and said, “His name is Andrew, he’s not a girl. And no I had nothing to do with that.” <br />
<br />
Rico looked annoyed to be corrected. Clearly that Andrew had lady parts anyway. Well...now the main lady part was on Rico’s body. Did that make him a woman? The thought made his new vagina squirt out a bit. <br />
<br />
Tom saw the liquid squirt out from his dad and finally noticed that his dad had a vagina. “Holy shit! You have a vagina!! That must be Andrew’s,” said Tom, marveling at his dad’s modified anatomy, “Did you do this on purpose when you switched back?”<br />
<br />
“What?! No!” Said Rico who was further titillated by the accusation that he would’ve given himself this anatomy by choice, his pussy squirting some more.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god dad, you’re practically orgasming just standing there having a vagina. Maybe you wanna see how the other half lives?” Asked Tom, horny to now be the one to fuck his dad’s body.<br />
<br />
Rico closed his robe, trying to hide his new front pussy, saying, “I had plenty of ‘seeing how the other half lives’ when I was trapped in that ‘Andrew’s’ body! Now get your mind out of the gutter, I am still your father!” He desperately wished what Tom said wasn’t true. But it was. Rico wanted to be drilled right there by his youngest son. He wanted to really let go and be fucked like he always imagined women felt. <br />
<br />
Tom snaked his muscular arm into the robe, putting a finger in his dad’s new hole, rubbing his pleasure stick.<br />
<br />
“Come on dad, nobody will ever know. We have a unique opportunity here,” said Tom, wiggling the finger that was in his dad’s vagina.<br />
<br />
“Oh...son that’s...oh my god. That feels good. This is so wrong, you’re my son! Ohhhh fuuuuck,” moaned Rico as his son skillfully fingered him.<br />
<br />
Before long Rico gave up on being a proper dad and let his son have full reign on his mostly masculine body. Tom felt up his dad’s ass for the second time today, but this time it was while being balls deep into his dad’s cunt. Getting saucy, Tom fingered his dad’s ass while fucking him from the front. The stimulation of his prostate and his g-spot made Rico convulse in orgasm. At the same time, Tom came inside of his dad while kissing his fuzzy neck.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you dare tell anyone about this,” said Rico, going to the solitude of his room with his son’s cum drizzling out of his new snatch.</p>
