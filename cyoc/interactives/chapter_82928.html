<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You emerged with the latest mandible-full of dirt for the construction of your nest with a great deal of concern in your mind. Doctor <br />
Benjamin had broken his promise to keep the fact that you were a giant ant queen secret and had sent the security camera footage to his <br />
superiors. He had also asked for someone's military to move in and try and capture you before the drones &quot;rape&quot; you and you began laying <br />
eggs that would hatch into more giant ants. He didn't know that Hank had already become your drone and that you had mated with him and that <br />
you would soon be laying eggs and that you now looked forward to mating with the other drones as well. But regardless of what he knew, <br />
Doctor Benjamin was proving to be a serious threat to you and the colony's future. You never wanted to be poked and prodded by anyone, <br />
getting the colony back to its ancestral home was in the best interest of your freedom. Doctor Benjamin had promised to make you a lab <br />
animal, even if he had &quot;good&quot; intentions.<br />
<br />
You ignored the other ants as they went into the shaft that had been dug to continue building your nest to move toward Hank Pym as your <br />
first drone was feeding on a large beetle that your workers had stung, and that beetle then grew to great size. You could hear as his <br />
mandibles crushed through the enlarged beetle's exoskeleton and his mouth behind them then chewed and ate the softer inside material of the <br />
beetle. It represented some hope that your colony could be allowed to not only live but grow. After all, you did know that invertebrates <br />
all bred in large numbers. You would lay lots of eggs that giant Divine Fire Ants would hatch from, the beetle likely laid or sired many <br />
eggs to replace it, and there were other invertebrates in the Amazon. Your colony would be able to feed without doing damage to the Amazon <br />
rainforest.<br />
<br />
But Doctor Benjamin didn't know of that development, and given that he had already broken his promise, it was doubtful that he would accept <br />
any report that Divine Fire Ant venom, which transformed you and Hank into a Queen and Drone ant respectively, enlarged invertebrates to <br />
massive size. As such, you felt that you had to talk with Hank about some method to defend the colony from whatever threat would surely <br />
come from Doctor Benjamin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hank,&quot; you said to him as you approached him.<br />
<br />
Hank paused in eating and turned his head to you as you reached him. You soon felt his antennae touch yours softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Christine, my Queen,&quot; Hank spoke, sounding with the same undying love that you had heard in the rest of the colony, which made your <br />
love for him grow in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to talk about your partner, Hank,&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
Hank tilted his head in confusion and you decided to try and explain what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I'm sure you've noticed we can now all talk to each other telepathically,&quot; You began to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Hank nodded, &quot;It's something I plan to look into... or at least theorize on... why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I've also been able to get some sense of things through the colony... and not just hearing them talk to me or being close enough <br />
to &quot;overhear&quot; what they say to each other but that I see what they see and hear what they hear,&quot; you replied, &quot;and since you joined us and <br />
the rest of the colony grew... it's grown stronger...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A sort of hive-mind,&quot; Hank said slowly, &quot;I suppose it would fit, since ants are social insects... and since you are the Queen Ant and most <br />
important part of the colony, it would be perfectly understandable that you are the one who can see, hear, and feel all these things and <br />
the colony is linked to you...&quot;<br />
<br />
You weren't quite sure if that was entirely it, since the ants that would be yours and Hank's children were still in the process of <br />
developing into fully formed eggs in your abdomen. The workers that had stung you had done so because the queen that had died had not laid <br />
an egg that was raised to replace the dead queen. However, you weren't that great at science so you weren't going to try and speculate on <br />
Hank's theories.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but the thing is, remember the two ants I left to spy on Doctor Benjamin?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... thanks to the greater strength of the link to the colony I could see and hear what they saw,&quot; you continued, &quot;and Doctor Benjamin <br />
has betrayed me... betrayed us. Contacted the company you worked for and told them of my transformation and sent security camera footage to <br />
prove my existence as a giant ant queen and said that we're going to eat all the animals in the Amazon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank then looked to the beetle he had been eating from.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd figured this guy would prove that that would not be the case,&quot; Hank commented, &quot;It'll mean we'll need to eat bugs for the rest of our <br />
lives... but then hey... insects actually are delicacies in some cultures...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't need to convince me on that,&quot; you cut him off, &quot;I've actually been growing more and more accustomed to the idea... it's like <br />
when I was first stung I became an ant on the outside and now... I'm becoming one on the inside too... and I don't care... I might even <br />
WANT to... but I will tell you what I do not want... I do not want to be some lab animal. I want to be left alone to lay my eggs in peace.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank began to caress your antennae and head with his antennae and you could feel love between the two of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still have my cellphone and the gear that we'll need for going deeper into the secrets of the Divine Fire Ant as a species,&quot; Hank <br />
answered, &quot;I figured that I'd send him an email from it once we're all safely underground.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if that isn't enough?&quot; you asked, &quot;he talked about recruiting some military capture team...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To kill you?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To take me back to America to turn me back,&quot; you answered, &quot;and if I still wanted that to happen... I would not be carrying three thousand <br />
eggs at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three thousand...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give or take a few hundred,&quot; you told him, &quot;and that will surely grow when the other drones add their sperm to yours... and I don't know <br />
how I know... I just... I just know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Instinct,&quot; Hank commented, &quot;For the moment, Doctor Benjamin is not a threat. Even if the US or Brazil mobilize troops, it'll take a day or <br />
two for them to even reach the company camp. By then we will be underground and the nest hidden. We can then send the message that will let <br />
him know that we can feed on insects without fear of starving ourselves or eating everything in sight. Once he knows that, Doctor Benjamin <br />
will calm down a bit... he really isn't a bad guy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And suppose he doesn't believe you? Suppose he wants proof? Can your phone take pictures?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... no,&quot; Hank said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if he wants proof?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank didn't immediately answer, which only added to your nervousness. This surely meant that the answer wouldn't be a good one.<br />
<br />
&quot;We may have to give it to him,&quot; Hank answered, &quot;Leave the carcass of this beetle outside the nest and direct him to it. It'll mean greater <br />
exposure... but to be honest, my Queen... complete secrecy probably went out the door the instant he saw you. We may need to give some of <br />
our daughters to them for experiments or work outside the colony or accept them bringing stuff here and conducting experiments here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If ANYONE does experiments,&quot; you said firmly, &quot;it will be you. I trust you not to do anything to hurt our daughters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank only caressed you with his antennae again. The answer he gave you wasn't good in the sense that you'd get a happy ending and would be <br />
left alone and you guessed that he was feeling your unease radiate off of you, which probably meant that the colony's &quot;hive-mind&quot; didn't <br />
just go to you but went both ways.</p>
