<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Duncan and Alyssa both remained beneath water for about a minute, same as with Fiona, before breaching the surface together. Roxanne‘s eyes widened immediately. Now she was really irked about getting splashed and whether that short-changed her form. Duncan looked absolutely gorgeous!<br />
<br />
He himself had invoked goddesses and what Roxanne could see of her new body definitely looked like a goddess from myth. She had prominent “flotation devices“ to help her out of the water. They jiggled and bounced as she pushed herself above the surface and looked around for Alyssa, who already made it over to the edge of the jetty and offered his hand. <br />
<br />
Duncan took it while twisting, looking down, and flailing in embarrassment and uncertainty. Getting to her feet with Alyssa holding her up, the brand-new Duncan was revealed.<br />
<br />
Her hair didn’t get that much longer but then it was slick against her face and darkly plastered to her neck and shoulders. Her eyes even seemed prettier. She had an ivory-soft complexion not too different than Duncan’s stay-inside pastiness but refined and delicate. Her hips had vastly widened and a thick, rounded style “badonkadonk” (The technical term Roxanne chose) followes her out as she swiveled to check the lake. <br />
<br />
So far as her immense chest, she had Chiara handily beat. The side boob spilling over to the front and overwhelming so much of her chest left the startled, timid new girl unsure where to rest her arms and especially unclear what she looked like beyond the expansive Grand Tetons. <br />
<br />
“Hi…” was the first thing she said with a dainty hand raised and looking for a place to land across her soft, fair flesh. Roxanne found it pleasing that Duncan was actually slightly shorter than her, although the arch of her hair atop her tanned head made the difference appear larger than it was. Her voice sounded high and girly without even trying. <br />
<br />
Alyssa looked like he was made after the mold of Fiona‘s manly form. He loomed large above them all with a broad face dappled in facial hair. His neck in particular seemed like it had done plenty of lifting on its own. His chest was broad, rigid, and ripped with plenty of packs to spare. He should’ve been posing on the beach. There wasn’t quite a kielbasa on display but it wasn’t lacking either. <br />
<br />
It took Duncan just a moment to glance over and see exactly how former girl Alyssa had filled out. Her hand wandered a few places around her leg before she offered up simply, “Oh…“ Roxanne mused that the girl could easily give the guy a full tit job and then some. Alyssa appeared rather at a loss for what to do with her masculine form. He didn’t seem upset or disappointed and his eyes readily noticed Duncan’s figure. <br />
<br />
What’s surprised Roxanne as she turned to make sure that Jake grabbed some blankets for them, was the speed at which Duncan reached her hand out for that fresh sausage meat. The girl squeaked when her hand laid on it, but she didn’t retreat from firmly stroking its length. <br />
<br />
“Oh God!” Alyssa gasped as her manhood rose into the air from Duncan‘s ministrations. Plaintively, Alyssa stammered for words and managed, “It’s… it’s okay… you don’t…”<br />
<br />
Duncan just took this as a sign to go harder and faster. To Roxanne’s surprise, Duncan easily crouched and set her mouth to work. In the back of her head, she recalled something Barry and Duncan once said and wondered if the ravenous new girl was trying to speedrun this. Her sexual ferocity didn’t stop there. As soon she had a clear line of her saliva across that just emerged manhood, she rose up and did just what Roxanne pondered by squeezing that sausage between her big pillows. And it didn’t stop there as she stretched up on her tiptoes, gripped the powerful length, and guided it against her soft thighs. At most, it just straddled her crotch without penetration but Roxanne wondered if that step wasn’t far away.<br />
<br />
She further wondered if maybe there was a downside to full exposure as busty Duncan had gone from shyly stepping out as a girl to practically losing her virginity in minutes. Mercifully, the frantic energy slowed and Duncan returned to squeezing the new dick with her hands before it finally erupted. <br />
<br />
Alyssa sweat in exhausted shock as Duncan brought her cum speckled hand up to her mouth. Unlike when Alyssa did it, the new girl hesitated but breathed in a clear breath before licking it clean. Alyssa managed an exhausted comment of, “Jesus…” Roxanne knew clearly that, despite his soft-spoken nature, Duncan could damn well keep a promise. <br />
<br />
Roxanne raised an eyebrow when Duncan went back to lick her hand for any remaining traces. Did semen really taste that good? Jake showed up with a large towel for Alyssa and a smaller one for Duncan. Roxanne noticed that Duncan flicked her expressive eyes towards Alyssa‘s manhood as it drooped and settled from all that excitement. Down, girl! Don’t break the thing before he’s gotten a feel for it. Roxanne kept this thought to herself but encouraged the two of them to head back onto dry land. <br />
<br />
Duncan wrapped herself up in the towel with the upper folds barely stretching to cloak her jutting bust. Below, it made for little more than a mini skirt with the space between her legs provocatively hinted. Softly, Duncan admitted, as she tested the fit of the towel and brushed her hands through her still-soaked hair, “I wanted this. So bad. Not quite this much, my goodness. But this feels good.” Her confident gaze dwindled into sheepish reservation. <br />
<br />
Roxanne thought she had it figured out. The lake doesn’t really grant your wish. Barry, gullible and shy, given an outgoingly gorgeous body which needed to beware of tricks and charm. Herself, muscular and tough, placed as a skinny girl with a slight presence. Jess, understated and thoughtful lady, bolstered with muscles and toughness she may not know how to use. Fiona,… Well it kind of fell apart there. She seemed like she would be happy with anything. But Duncan apparently wanted to be a girl, a slight one, from what she expressed, and instead was given a form very much out there. And it remained to be seen with Alyssa. <br />
<br />
Despite Duncan’s qualification, she didn’t seem particularly upset. Every few steps, she bounced her knee to give her bust an obvious jiggle against the towel. Roxanne stepped away to let Jake, Brock, and Barry deal with clothes. She tended to the fire instead. It didn’t take long before Duncan had a skirt of her own to flaunt and a silver top. She twirled in place as Roxanne flashed a quick smile.<br />
<br />
Casually, Roxanne inquired, “Trans?”<br />
<br />
Duncan adjusted her top and rocked her hip. ”Never so bold. Daydreams. Fantasies. And quiet sadness. I wanted this so much. Even if every minute after now is a disappointment. Even if I get clobbered by lady troubles and back problems especially. Still worth it to my soul. Which makes me freak out to admit. But it’s good to say and not couch it in any sort of excuse. Are you okay? I assume it’s not the same for you but maybe I shouldn’t assume.”<br />
<br />
Roxanne took a long breath through her nose. “Yeah. Miss Rogers. I’m all right and I’ll be okay. Just still trying to figure out how a man’s man like me didn’t become a woman’s woman.” She saw that Duncan warmly delighted with the “miss” take. Thoughtfully, Duncan squeezed her hands through the sleeves and proposed, “You are always deeply admirable. But then you’ve always been cool. None of that has changed. I’m glad you came, but I’m sorry how things went. If that makes any sense. Also, what do you think of the name… Miranda? Personal fave. But just trying it out.”<br />
<br />
Roxanne nodded to Miranda and concluded the name was “lovely”. Alyssa returned and lingered around for a bit with a tight blue shirt and jeans her just managed to squeeze into. Despite how intimate they had been, the two of them felt like nervous strangers. Between searching for words, Miranda clapped her hands and hustled over to the car. She returned with one of the empty two gallon water jugs. <br />
<br />
“I know we sort of resolved a little bit about how the water works, incidentally. But I want to take a good sample and perhaps get it under a microscope and then I also know some people who might be interested and couldn’t make it. Could you help me?” Roxanne followed her over to the jetty and despite her lessened muscles, worked with her to fill the jug practically to the top. Marveling, Miranda noted, “The water here is so pristine that I can’t tell that it came from a lake like this and not a purified source. Fascinating!”<br />
<br />
With folded arms, Roxanne listened patiently as Miranda hopped around, jiggled, and geeked out over all the little discoveries of the lake. After tucking with a big bottle in the back, she pulled out some water testing supplies from her bag and dipped samples onto the papers. Roxanne considered, in retrospect, that this sort of testing may have been better for them to do prior to all this. Miranda concurred and noted her results on a pad. Alyssa lingered around and Roxanne asked her casually, “ You all right?”<br />
<br />
Alyssa seemed uncertain from the question but didn’t bristle the same way she used to as a woman. “Yeah. I feel fine. Maybe I was expecting something more, but this is a good start. A fresh start on a better life. It’s gonna take inventing a new identity and a bunch of stuff from shady people, but it’ll be all right.” Alyssa had a name picked out as well but with the added detail of a new surname for a clean break from her history. Ross Hanover to replace Alyssa Eckhart. <br />
<br />
The afternoon started to dip as the fresh brand new sheen faded to calm and curiosity for what next. Between analyzing the water, Roxanne managed to ask Miranda about how a certain thing tasted. Timidly, Miranda whispered, “Tangy but sweet and a little like chili for lunch but diluted. Quite the aftertaste and I don’t know…but I wanted Ross to feel sexy about it. I’m probably weird…I’m definitely weird. But that’s how it was for me.”<br />
<br />
Without warning, the quiet was broken by a swoop of birds blackening the edge of the sky and swinging around. Moments later, they could all hear a loud engine roaring on the dirt road as a black van pulled into the clearing. Everyone stopped what they were doing and watched. <br />
<br />
Out of the passenger side stepped a lanky, skinny man, bordering on emaciated, wearing dark sunglasses. He wore a gray suit with a crumpled, white shirt underneath and what looked to be a catcher’s helmet on his head. <br />
<br />
He clapped his gaunt hands together and declared, “All right, you horny kids, get your stuff together, put that out, and follow us in your car. Now!”</p>
