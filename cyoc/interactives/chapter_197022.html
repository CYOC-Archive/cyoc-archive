<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having now told Roger that she was heading to the Omega, Maureen thought she had no choice but to turn left out of the driveway rather than to the right which was the way back to Liz’s house.<br />
<br />
She then figured she couldn’t change again until the morning, so she may as well enjoy her night as Liz. After all she was dressed up and had just told Roger she was going to the Omega. Why not? She had enjoyed herself last night as Lily. She knew she was now quite stunning. What sort of reaction would she get from the men in the room in Liz’s body? She was eager to find out.<br />
……..<br />
With Liz gone Roger was quite keen to get back to where he and Maureen had left off. Unfortunately, Maureen’s mood seemed to have changed thanks to Liz’s visit. She seemed unusually concerned about where Liz had been headed for. “Where is she going? Did she say anything to you?” <br />
<br />
When Roger told her “She said she was off to the Omega”<br />
<br />
Maureen looked quite alarmed “The Omega! That’s a sleazy pick up joint!” <br />
<br />
“Well that’s what she told me. Meeting a friend there”<br />
<br />
“I hope she’s not going to do anything stupid”<br />
<br />
“Why so concerned? Liz is a grown woman”<br />
<br />
“But she doesn’t usually go to sleazy places”<br />
<br />
“It’s none of our business where she goes. You can’t be her keeper. If Liz wants to meet someone at the Omega that’s her choice”<br />
<br />
“Your right. I just ………. don’t want to see her ruin her reputation”<br />
<br />
“Liz is a classy woman. I trust her not to do anything stupid”<br />
<br />
The real Liz didn’t reply. She liked that Roger thought Liz was classy but she did not totally trust Maureen with her body. But she realised she had no choice but to trust Maureen. The situation was out of Liz’s hands.<br />
………..<br />
Meanwhile Maureen couldn’t help but notice Marcus and Tim at a table by the bar as soon as she entered. They were talking to a blonde woman. Maureen sauntered up to the bar close enough to Marcus that he could not fail to see her.<br />
<br />
She got the response she was hoping for. Marcus left the other two and strolled across to stand behind her. When Maureen asked the barman for a Martini, Marcus’s deep voice immediately addressed the bartender. “I’ll pay for the lady’s drink” in his deep seductive voice.<br />
On queue Maureen turned to see Marcus’s deep blue eyes trying to seduce her.<br />
<br />
Soon she was at the table joining Tim and the blonde woman whose name was Kate. Maureen thought better than to use Liz’s name and introduced herself as Cynthia.<br />
<br />
She got the same story as last night about how Tim and Marcus were mortgage brokers from Sydney and were here to celebrate a deal they had made. <br />
<br />
Maureen suspected they were professional skirt chasers and tried to catch them in a lie and quizzed the men “How long are you here for?”<br />
“This is our third night” replied Tim. “We head home tomorrow morning” <br />
<br />
“And when did you make this big deal?” <br />
<br />
“We actually made the deal yesterday but only signed the paperwork today” Marcus replied. <br />
<br />
No matter what Maureen asked their stories were consistent. They even admitted that they had been at the bar the previous night. “We were here last night and found the company very hospitable. We thought we would try our luck a second time”<br />
<br />
Maureen knew they were skirt chasers but they were actually witty and very good company. And Marcus did have eyes to die for. She had been locked up all day with no company other than the quick visit home. She decided she would enjoy her evening but not let herself be seduced. It would not be the right thing to do while she wore Liz’s body.<br />
 <br />
Tim and Kate left to ‘Look at the view from my room’ but this time Maureen declined the invitation to go with them. Marcus stayed with her and before she could object had bought her a second drink. Maureen was determined not to drink it as she needed to drive back to Liz’s house. She had fresh memories of drinking too much the night she had borrowed Kirsty’s body and the consequent inability to return home on time.<br />
<br />
Shortly afterwards Maureen was recognised by another patron. An older brunette gave Maureen a wave. Maureen had no idea who she was but clearly the woman recognised her as Liz. Maureen gave the woman a smile and a limp wave back. Now word would get around town that Liz had been spotted at the bar. <br />
<br />
“A friend of yours? Should we go and say hello?” asked Marcus<br />
<br />
“Not a close friend. I can’t even recall her name. I don’t want to talk to her” Maureen replied with a giggle.<br />
<br />
“So you won’t mind if I whisk you away from here?”<br />
<br />
“I should get going. I didn’t want a late night”<br />
<br />
“Did you drive here?”<br />
<br />
“Yes I drove here”<br />
<br />
“I’ll walk you to your vehicle. It’s not safe for young women on their own after dark”<br />
<br />
Maureen found herself giggling again. It was nice to be thought of as a young woman. “Why thank you Marcus you are a real gentleman”<br />
Indeed, Marcus took her hand and led her out of the bar. Somehow that arm slipped around her waist as they approached the carpark. “I can’t tempt you with the view from my room? It’s even better than the view from Tim’s. I’m on the top floor with views over the city. It’s really spectacular”<br />
<br />
Maureen had seen that view only yesterday. It was spectacular. She was tempted. Her hormones were responding to Marcus’s presence and she felt wet. She could not deny that she was attracted to Marcus. “Sounds great but I should go. I think if I accompanied you to your room I wouldn’t just be looking at the view”<br />
<br />
“You have seen through me. I can’t deny that I am very attracted to you. You are a spectacular woman”<br />
<br />
Maureen blushed and giggled once more. She knew Marcus was not lying. She knew she was very attractive and it was a great feeling. “You’re not too bad yourself” she replied truthfully.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps my appetite for you could be sated with a kiss? Would you mind?”<br />
<br />
Maureen had accepted two drinks from Marcus so she guessed she probably did owe him a kiss. He had been good company and she knew from last night that he was a very good kisser. Right now she was a single unattached woman. What harm could come from a kiss? No one else was in the car park to see them. The real Liz wouldn’t know.<br />
<br />
Marcus read Cynthia’s body language and could see she was not objecting to his suggestion. He wrapped his arms around the gorgeous redhead and bought his lips to hers. He got the response he was hoping for. She returned his kiss with passion. <br />
<br />
Just then fireworks began to go off. For a moment Maureen thought it was just in her mind but Marcus stopped the kiss and said “Oh look at that! It’s fireworks! Is there some festival on in town? Quick let’s go to my room and watch it from there”<br />
<br />
Maureen recalled there were fireworks scheduled tonight. It was as celebration for some cultural festival. The coincidence of the fireworks starting just as she kissed Marcus was too much for her. She let herself be led back into the lobby of the hotel and into the lift with Marcus. <br />
Two minutes later on Marcus’s balcony they resumed the kiss, this time with the fireworks in the background.<br />
 <br />
When the fireworks finished 10 minutes later, Maureen’s resolve to leave had been broken. She let Marcus undress her and lead her to his bed.</p>
