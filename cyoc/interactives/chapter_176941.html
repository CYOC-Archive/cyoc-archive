<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To Paul&#39;s utter shock, Emily Rick and his wife were all themselves once again!<br />
<br />
Olivia was sitting at the edge of one side of the couch, while Emily sat against Rick with his arm wrapped around Emily. The three of them seemed to be chatting away, as if nothing had ever happened! Paul soon realized he couldn&#39;t see the camera anywhere in sight. <br />
&quot;Oh God, don&#39;t tell me they forgot I exist!?&quot; He thought in a panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;MEaaoow!&quot; Paul cried, hopping up onto the table in a hurry.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH! Dear me, Paul you nearly scared me half to death.&quot; Olivia chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrow?&quot; He asked puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, relax Dad we remember you.&quot; Emily guessed what he was asking with a grin.<br />
<br />
Paul lowered his head in relief. He then swirled his head around, searching for the camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paul honey it&#39;s right here.&quot; Olivia laughed, picking up the Camera from underneath the coffee table. &quot;I bet you&#39;re wondering how we managed to turn back right?&quot; She asked, to which Paul nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, after you left, I transformed myself.&quot; Emily started. &quot;I turned into an old lady, which sucked big time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I went next...&quot; Rick mumbled, clearly annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And turned into a lovely vase that really just brought the room together.&quot; Emily teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;After that, we knew that randomly transforming would get us nowhere, so I asked Emily about the extra functions all over the camera. She told me that it used to work but not any more, which is when I decided to take it in for repair.&quot; Olivia added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roaw?!&quot; Paul gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I know don&#39;t sass me.&quot; Olivia rolled her eyes. &quot;I knew the risks, but I was still a beefy male version of myself and was extra cautious with it. We took it to Costco and told them all the strange words on it were because it was for some art piece. Twenty minutes later and they got it all fixed up, told us that the main button was stuck so hard down that the others couldn&#39;t be used, but that now it&#39;d work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily leant forwards with a smile. &quot;Then we came home, selected for a 20 year old white human male and turned Rick back. After that it only took a few to fix us all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We would&#39;ve turned you back to but we didn&#39;t know what would happen to change somebody while they slept.&quot; Rick added.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fantastic right?&quot; Olivia smiled, to which Paul blankly stared at her. &quot;Right right, you just wanna be yourself again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul nodded, then hopped off the table and onto the open floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Paul, I&#39;ll start with species.&quot; Olivia announced, snapping a photo of the cat that was her husband.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
In an instant, Paul found himself shoot up in height. He felt the all too familiar extra hair, dress, and tight shoes. <br />
&quot;What, I&#39;m a little girl again?&quot; Paul complained.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least you&#39;re not naked.&quot; Rick chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, you look about 6... I guess that&#39;s how old you were as a cat.&quot; Emily noticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be good to remember.&quot; Olivia added. Paul was about to ask why it was important but before he could Olivia took another shot.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
Paul suddenly grew tall, tall enough to be an adult again but not back to full height. He still felt the extra hair, but now also felt some... extra weight. He looked down to see two large breasts lying underneath locks of golden hair.<br />
&quot;Great, let me guess... my own age again but a woman? Oh God, I sound like my sister.&quot; Paul said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right on the nose!&quot; Emily said. &quot;You even look like her.&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;One more to go.&quot; Olivia announced, lifting up the camera yet again.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
Finally, Rick felt everything was where it should be. Little hair on his head and face, normal jeans and a shirt, and most happily of all his pride and joy was back.<br />
&quot;Ah, that&#39;s better!&quot; Paul chuckled. &quot;Wait, I thought you said you could select multiple changes at once? Why&#39;d you do one at a time?&quot; He then asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it&#39;s more fun!&quot; Olivia laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, this isn&#39;t exactly a laughing matter.&quot; Paul replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad it&#39;s totally fine!&quot; Emily chuckled. &quot;It was different when it was all random and we had no idea when we&#39;d be ourselves again, but now we have TOTAL control over every change... here watch this.&quot; She said before hopping up and swiping the camera from her mother.<br />
<br />
Paul followed her to the front window, where they lifted up the curtains. Across the street, the neighbor kid Ben was riding his bicycle down the block. He was close to passing their older neighbor Gloria who was shuffling to her car, and a stray cat rested under the car. Emily quickly hit some options and then took another photo.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
Now walking down the front walkway to a newer car were three teenaged girls. One looked latina with curly black hair and an amazing ass, which looked identical to some old photos of Gloria from the 70s. Behind her was a ditzy blonde girl, with larger tits and a slutty outfit which resembled Ben&#39;s mother somewhat. Finally a redhead followed them both, and although Paul had never seen her before, the cat that had been there previously had had orange hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily!&quot; Paul gasped. &quot;Change them back!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Relax Dad, watch.&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
As the three girls leaned close together to take a selfie, presumably for instagram, Emily flashed them once more.<br />
<br />
FLASH<br />
<br />
Just like that, Ben continued biking past the house like nothing had happened, Gloria slowly climbed into her car, and the stay cat went chasing after a squirrel. <br />
<br />
&quot;See? There&#39;s a &#39;revert form&#39; option, so if you take a picture of a changed person with that, they turn back to before any changes were made. But I still say it doesn&#39;t even matter anyway since it changes reality. Those three girls were about to have a fun night and they never would&#39;ve known that they had been different.&quot; Emily said with an eye roll as she placed the camera back on the coffee table.<br />
<br />
Olivia sighed. &quot;Well Paul, welcome to the debate we&#39;ve been having while you were asleep.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Emily believes that we should use the camera for whatever we want. I believe that we should use it but only to either help people or punish people who deserve that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While I&#39;m in the let&#39;s just use it if we absolutely need to camp.&quot; Rick added with his arms crossed, shuttering as he remembered sitting there as nothing but a vase.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; Paul gasped. &quot;No! Absolutely none of those! We should bury that thing so far in the basement or attic that we never see it again!&quot; He announced.<br />
<br />
<br />
The next hour and a half was nothing but a long debate. While it started as a four way debate, it soon merged onto a two way debate. Paul and Rick argued for limited to no use while Emily and Olivia argued for much more usage. Eventually, one of the original points finally hit a few solid points and they all decided to go with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine then, are we clear about what the rules will be?&quot; Paul asked.<br />
<br />
Everyone nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, so...&quot; Paul began.</p>
