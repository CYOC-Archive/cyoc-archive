<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Gentlemen I want to thank you for your understanding but I do apologize anyway. This cream was only suppose to remove body hair, not make it grow so profusely. I’m sure I have something in the store that will remove that….”<br />
The NO screamed by the two young men in the store actually made the glass canister of combs sitting on the counter shake.<br />
“We… sort of like it.” Dewey said reaching up and twirling his finger around his lover Jamie’s nipple. Jamie was sitting in the Barber’s chair without his shirt on. The men had wanted to come in the day after the cream that denuded Dewey’s body of hair also added a rug of thick silky black hair to Jamie, literally, from head to toe. But they’ve been busy in their dorm room getting caught up on lost time for a few days. “We just thought a trim would be enough and…..”<br />
“If I put some on my face, would it grow a beard?” Jamie blurted out.  It was obviously something he had been thinking of but was hesitant to mention.  But the chances of it working were too awesome for him to miss the opportunity.  <br />
“Anything is possible. I don’t think it would hurt. Why don’t we try it out while I tidy some of these split ends.”<br />
The Barber pours a hand of the cream and started applying it to Jamie’s face. It feels cooler on his skin than it did the other night when the two boys played around with the cream for the first time. But that was in a steamy bathroom, not an air-conditioned storefront Barbershop. Under the nose, along the cheeks and down the neck. Leaving a bit just connecting to his chest hair. <br />
Most of the changed due Jamie were done the other night in that shower. He became taller, more muscular, more self-assured and of course, as queer as they come. The Barber’s work on his hair was to bring the last few pieces into place. The back was trimmed down and evened off and the sides too. But when the Barber ran the comb through the top of Jamie’s head, a large number of hairs came out. A few more passes and Jamie was starting to show a bit of a male baldness pattern on top. Nothing too dramatic, just enough to add some maturity without adding age. Men with this much body hair usually sported a smooth top early in life, something about the amount of testosterone needed to grow this much body hair. The head would look better shaved but, the Barber was going to leave that to the boys to take on their own as they continued their discovery of each other and themselves. Jamie was far from being a full bear, but he certainly was on his way to becoming a first class cub. <br />
“Let’s see how this went” The Barber said taking the towel off the counter and beginning to wipe away the cream from Jamie’s face. What was left behind was a full, black beard several inches long. The mustache hung down over the upper lip and was soon trimmed into a shape without losing its thickness. Dewey reached up and began stroking it. Light shined off the hair as if it had been oiled, but the effect came from the rich deep color alone. <br />
“That looks just perfect. Soft, but almost like fishing wire at the same time. So wish I could grow a beard like this.”<br />
“You will if you ever grow up.” Jamie said. His voice was now deeper and included a think Mexican accent.<br />
“I should start calling you Popi.”<br />
“Yes, you should.”<br />
Dewey went in for a kiss as soon as Jamie pulled his shirt back on over is head. It was a long and deep kiss that pushed the large Mexican back into his chair. As they kissed three people walked into the shop. While it was two men and a woman, they were dress fairly similarly, smart business suits, briefcases and dark glasses.  One who’s quick to stereotype would have thought them to be lawyers, and for once their rush to judgment would have been right.  Their talking amongst themselves did nothing to interrupt the two lovers making out in the chair, for a minute or two at least.<br />
“Hey, how come I can taste this morning breakfast in his beard when it just grew?” Dewey said pulling away from Jamie’s lips.<br />
“Because the beard has been there for months. No one can grow body hair or a beard just by applying some topical cream.” <br />
“Oh yea…”<br />
“Guess we’re done.” Jamie said getting out of the chair. “But we’ll be back.”<br />
The two boys weren’t out of the store before the woman approached the Barber. But while she was making every effort to make eye contact, the Barber couldn’t help but notice the reaction of the two men who came in with her to Dewey and Jamie’s affection for each other. Eyes rolled in their heads and the laughed under their breath while taking out clipboards and starting to write.<br />
“Yes, hello,….Hi, yes, I’m looking for the owner of the shop, would you happen to know where I can contact him?”<br />
“I’m the owner, is there something the matter?”<br />
“Now…… are you the ‘Owner’ or the ‘Tenant’?” She asked in a very condescending tone. “ There’s been some confusion with that along the row here. I’m looking for the person or the company that actually ‘owns’ the building we’re standing in.”<br />
“I own the building and the land under it. I have…. My family has owned it for generations. I am the sole owner. Let me save all of us some time, I’ve been through this more times than I can count. I’m not selling.”<br />
“Well, you haven’t even heard our offer.”<br />
“There’s not an offer you can make that I would be interested in.”<br />
The conversation went back and forth for a while, getting increasingly frustrating for the young woman who wasn’t used to such strong opposition. In the meantime the two men who entered the store with her continued to walk around and even start to take measurements. The Barber had to call them off from walking into his back room several times. They too did not seem the type how had ever heard No before. <br />
“I see I’m getting no where. I think what might be best is if you talk to our boss. He can give you a bigger picture of what we have planned for this area. I must have left my cell in the rental….guys, phone.” She said turning to the other two men, but they came up empty too. “Great. Do you have a phone I can use to let our boss know which location to meet us at?”<br />
“I’m sorry, I don’t have a phone.”<br />
“You don’t……”<br />
“No, so many people have cell phones it’s hardly worth getting a regular phone.”<br />
“So you’re store’s business number is your cell phone?”<br />
“Heaven’s no. I don’t have a cell phone,  I don’t believe in them.”<br />
“……….. Jeff, Mike stay here and keep him busy. Get haircuts or something. Try to talk some sense into him while I call Barney.” The woman said heading out the front door in a huff. There was a moment of uncomfortable silence before one of the men spoke.<br />
“You really should consider this offer.” One of the men said. He was in his mid 30, good looking but letting himself go a bit. His partner also in his 30’s seemed to be trying to hold onto his looks some, with a haircut that was too young for him and a few gray spots noticeably touched up.<br />
“And you should consider her suggestion of a hair cut. Take a seat Gentlemen.”<br />
The two men looked at each other, shrugged and got in the chairs.<br />
“Just a trim so we’ll look good in court.”<br />
“My pleasure.  If I my ask though, I couldn’t help but notice your….. reactions to my two previous customers.  Was there something that amused you?”<br />
“We just have this running conversation. Due to all the types of people we run into.  Now don’t get me wrong, I’ve got nothing against gay people, but come on.  Those guys are just flaunting it too much.  No one is ever going to take them seriously.”<br />
“There’s being homosexual, which I understand people can’t help going to, and there’s being queers.  Which is just too much.”<br />
“And those men were queers in your opinion?” the Barber asked placing the cloth around the two men’s necks.<br />
“Not flaming that’s for sure, not that bad.  More gay guys than queer boys, if you know what I mean.  There’s a difference.” The second man said<br />
“Sort of like how some light skinned black people were encouraged to ‘pass’ as white in order to lead happier lives.”  The Barber asked. “You feel perhaps some of the ‘queer boys’ should make more of an effort to pass as straight?”  <br />
“Yea, but instead of holding a paper bag next to their skin to see which is lighter, you can hold a Abercrombie and Fitch catalogue to see if they can keep from jumping for it.” One of the men said but they both laughed at.  <br />
“Those guys weren’t flamers. But to make it in the real world, unless they want to find themselves as waiters or in the fashion world, they’re going to have to butch it up some, act normal.  Keep the closet doors closed for their own good.  As long as they’re not broadcasting it, they should be happy.”<br />
“I see.  Interesting theory.  Let’s put it to the test shall we?” The Barber said going to work on the men. Taking out his electric razor he went to work on the first man.  While the man’s hair was not long, it was almost completely gone by the time the Barber was done working the sides and back.  As the razor cut through the hair it turned from a dark brown to a light blonde with red highlight.  His completion started to change to a lighter tone, the nose pugged out a bit and a sprinkle of freckles accented his checks and nose.  The nose suddenly, and a bit painfully took a sudden turn along the bridge as if it had been broken at one time and not completely set right.  <br />
“Ow.” Was all the man said in a slightly dreamy voice, but a much higher voice than before.<br />
With the sides and back down the Barber went to work on giving the man a classic high and tight flat top. And the clippers worked and the hair continued it change to blonde, he began to get younger, down to around 18 or so.  Under the cloth his muscles swelled and grew incredibly large.  All the while his height shrunk down to around 5’5”.  With the pale skin and shorter build his enlarging pecs almost would have looked like breasts if it wasn’t for their width and hang.  His chest hair changed to just a dusting of hair a bit redder than what was on his head.  As the pubic hair went a deep red. <br />
The Barber removed the cloth to reveal a teen-age hunk that looked like Huckleberry Finn gone gay.  Gym toned body with a few odd scars here and there, perhaps from a rough game of football.  Hands and feet slightly large and a bit callused.  Several silver earrings hung from each ear.  His now bright green eyes stared in complete shock at what had happened to him but he couldn’t move.<br />
The Barber whispered in his ear “You just stay put till we’re done with your buddy. Ok Huck?”<br />
“Sure” the man now more of a boy responded in an even higher voice than before.  <br />
Moving onto the other man the Barber took out the clippers and started removing the man hair completely.  As it did in the past, the shaving on the head brought on a darker skin tone.  Not as dark as the Barber usually liked to take his customers, but nothing wrong with a light chocolate tone on a man.  And he was the one who made the comment about light skinned black people. The work on the hair was much more basic than his partners but the changes no less dramatic.  Taking on the same gym stud body but in African American contours the man also became a teen of around 18, although he looked much younger.  His height went down to 5’6”.  The boys would find it easier to keep their gym build bodies on smaller frames.  When all was done, another teenage muscle stud sat in the chair.  His flat nose also given a slight break and a scar over his left eyebrow.  <br />
What was remarkable about both boys was the size their backs and legs took on.  Back muscles flared out from the spine.  Creating an almost shell like covering to the back.  When their arm raised the lats in back looked almost like bat wings connecting their biceps to their ribcages.  And the legs were minor versions of tree trunks.  Solid mass from years of leg presses with a defined detail only obtainable from miles of running.  Calves almost as big as their upper thighs.  It was going to be hard to find pants with a small enough waist along with legs large enough to contain all that girth.  The boys looked like bizarre versions of full size GI Joes, one black and one white.  <br />
But old or new GI Joes were pretty much sexless below the waist.  Here is where the boys differed.  He might have looked like Huckleberry Finn but his dick would have made a Billy doll feel lacking.  Long and thick cut but still formable.  A deep red that was getting a ruby coloring was it grew even bigger.  His darker friend lived up to expectations too, with his cock being even longer, thinker and darker than his lighter skin tone would normally have given.  His foreskin had not been removed and was pulling back tightly against the shaft as his head inched, literally, out.  <br />
“I have to say you’re both adorable.  In a sort of rough and tumble sort of way.  Why not get up and check it out?”<br />
With that the two men bolted form their chairs and ran to the mirrored wall across from them.  The looked at themselves, then each other, then back at them selves again.<br />
“This is totally insane.” The Huckleberry Finn want to be shouted then grabbed his throat as he heard his voice. “What the fuck is up with this voice!!!”  It was light and airy, high and free.  As stereotypical a gay boy’s voice as he ever thought he had heard.  <br />
“How can I be this totally fine black guy…with a voice that makes Michael Jackson sound like Method Man!!!!”  The other teen yelled.<br />
“And since when to you use phrases like ‘totally fine’?!?!?!  Or know who Method Man is?   How do I know who that is for that matter”<br />
“You have to admit, this will be the best way to test your theory won’t it?  If you lead the rest of your lives as gay men so incredibly proud of themselves that they do nothing to… douse their flame so to speak.  You are not only going to be the type of person you said should be living in the closet, but you’re going to be quite proud of the fact that you’re so open about it.”<br />
“Why turn us into major gym bunnies then also make us complete queers?!?!”<br />
“Variety.”<br />
“But this is insane!”<br />
“No, it’s life.  Not everyone fits society wishes for them.  Not everyone has that choice.  Or feels they need to sacrifice their own true self in order to make other’s happy, or at the least to get others to leave them alone.   There are men out there being beaten and subjected to real cruelty just for being themselves.  And it take much more backbone, much more bravery to continue to live your life as you wish it in spite of all it cost you, rather than acting the role of the straight man. Or an acceptable version of the friendly harmless queer.  The World has enough lawyers, it’s time to make role models out of you.  Your lawyer will be back soon to tell you how your both going to be two of the best known Queer boys in the country soon.”<br />
“You can’t do this!!  You have to change us back.”<br />
“What about our old lives, people will remember.  Linda will be back any minute”<br />
“Yes that’s true.  While once the new patterns have taken over you will be set up in complete and total new lives, that does not erase the old lives completely.  People will remember the old you.  People will notice you’re not around anymore.  Some might even come looking for you.  But the funny thing about people is, people forget.  They’ll come up with a reason all on their own as to why Jeff and Mike aren’t around anymore.  That’s not even my power working, its just human nature.”<br />
“No, no. no.  You have to stop this.  There has to be a way.”<br />
“Well, I guess it would be only fair to tell you, but some people find that coming to a complete sexual arousal, complete with ejaculation will stop the process from continuing”<br />
With that the two boys dropped the gym shorts they were wearing and grabbed their meat.  It felt both natural and different to them at the same time.  Enough precum had already leaked out of their dicks that, along with the sweat, was enough to lube them for action.<br />
“Should we jerk off each other?”<br />
“Shit man, get away form me.  The idea is to become less queer you idiot.”<br />
Their knees bent a little and their hips moved as they pumped them selves up and off.  Biceps strained and more than once they each fond playing with their now huge nipples helped with the process.  Sweat stains soon started appearing on the tight t-shirts they were wearing.  With in minutes Huck began to reach climax.<br />
“Finally, thank god.” He said as his dick shot cum across the floor.  Upon seeing that, knowing it was possible, his black friend began his last seconds till climax.  But he noticed something first.  The other guy wasn’t changing back.   As a matter of fact, a big shit eating grim came over his face.<br />
“Oh Boo, you get that hard on just for me?” He said kneeling down in his own gizz and taking the black boy’s cock first in his hands and then down his throat.  <br />
In a pained, raspy voice he looked the Barber in the eyes.  “I thought you said…. I thought you said we’d stop changing if we..” he was breathing too hard and  too close to cumming to complete the question.<br />
“Yea, sort of lied.  After the change, then comes the arousal and shooting off rids the body of the old self thus cementing the whole process.  It was either cumming or taking a dump on the floor.  I thought this would be more fun and easier to clean up.  You’re buddy’s actually kneeling in a puddle of his old self.  And from the looks of it, he’s about to take a mouth full of what used to make you… you.”<br />
The climax the young man felt was the best in his life, either the current or the previous.  The release went deeper than ever before.  For a moment he felt complete and total panic, but then nothing but pleasure and freedom.  A weight lifted from his soul as the new persona took over completely.<br />
“Make sure you don’t spill a drop girl.” He said rubbing his buddy’s head.  <br />
“Do I ever?”<br />
“Yes you do!  You are the sloppiest cum sucker I’ve ever known.  And I’ve known three or four.”<br />
“Three or four zero zero.”<br />
“I’m glad you liked the hair cuts boys.  Do you still think they’ll help you in court?”<br />
“They can’t hurt.  We look like we’re in the Army already, they should just let us in based on image.  But we just refuse to tone down the flame in order to get in.  No one’s got to ask in our cases cause honey, everyone can tell.”<br />
“If we can get through college, and play on the football team for all four years, considering all we went through and still earned the coach’s and team’s respect, I don’t see how the shit we’d get joining the service is going to be any worse.”<br />
“Very admirable goals boys.  I’m surprised your lawyer isn’t back yet.  Instead of just waiting around, would you like some ice cream?  You’re a bit older than the usual clients who get this certificate, but it’s still valid for a free cone next door.”<br />
“Free Ice Cream!! FUN!!!”<br />
“Ramone, a moment on the lips, a life time on those hips that already need a zip code all their own.”<br />
“You still got some of my seed there on your chin Huck, so don’t you be telling me what should be going down between these lips.”  <br />
“Good point.  Let’s go get ice cream.  Thanks Mister.”<br />
“I’m sure your lawyer will be waiting for you when you get back.”<br />
In fact they held the door open for their former partner as they exited out for their treat.<br />
“Great.  Where are the guys?  Did they leave?”<br />
“Yes, were you able to reach your boss?”<br />
“I sure did and is he angry.  Oh not at you… but at me.” As she sat in the Barber’s chair a tear came to her eye and she covered her face with her hands.  “This is really an important deal for him and if I can’t talk you into at least listening to what we have to offer…..  I’ve had to work so much harder to get where I am to have it all taken away…..” Her sobbing increased and she dropped her purse on the floor.<br />
“Oh my, how horrible.  I feel so sorry for you.”<br />
“Yes, it’s been just a constant….”<br />
“No no, not for that. I feel sorry for you that you think this might have worked.  I mean, it is 2004 not the 1950’s.  Does anyone really fall for that act?  As an actress you make a fairly lousy lawyer.”<br />
The mask of grief disappeared instantly as she returned to her previous cool self.  “It was either this or throwing myself at you, and I figured I’d try this first.”<br />
“Truly pathetic ever for a lawyer.  Lean back please.” The Barber said placing his finger on her forehead and pushing her back into the chair. “We need a better class of lawyer around the shop today.  And I think the neighborhood could use someone to look out for it, instead of trying to sell it out.”<br />
The Barber immediately went to work on the young woman, who quickly started turning into a young man.  Her breasts were not that big to begin with, so their shift into lean solid pecs was surprising only because now they were bigger than before.  It wasn’t just that her skirt became a dress pant, but that her growing cock needed room to expand in the trousers.  It wasn’t as long or as thick as her… well, his clients, but was still more cock than his former female self had even taken in her former cunt.<br />
After washing the hair the Barber pushed his fingers into the strands till they were deeply intertwined and started shaking the hair.  As the hair shoot it expanded, growing out in a fairly large Afro and turning a ginger brown.  With his scissors he started pairing it down some, shaping it into a more manageable length, without taking anything away from the seemingly wildness to the design.  As he clipped her skin darkened to a rich chocolate.  His muscles swelled, not too much, but into that of a man who worked out regularly and ran more than he worked out.  Leg muscles were long and lean, his remained a bit on the big side, but had rough calluses from all the miles they had run.  The ass, which was again fairly small for a woman, arched out and became firm.  A real ass for a runner but losing nothing of it’s heritage of being prime booty material.  Her face lengthened and became more manly and African.  Lips grew a bit and the nose spread and flattened even more than her clients.  <br />
His eyes never blinked, never looked away from the mirror across from him during the changes.  The former dark green eyes locking on the now dark brown eyes.  Long thin fingers reached down and worked his fly open, taking out his growing dick.  With his fingertips he could feel that his pubic hair was gone and he was now naturally smooth below the neck.  The line of skin that would have been under the hair now exposed and showed how much darker his dick was form the rest of him.  The thin fingers worked the shaft as the Barber finished the cut and started in on the facial hair.  As he sat in the chair thin amounts of hair started growing out from under his nose and across his chin.  Thin wirely hairs that were darker than the hair on the top of his head.  Carefully shaving them down the Barber left a thin line mustache that connected to a thin goatee. Which covered the underside of his chin more than the front.  His age had gone down a bit but not as far s the two boys, to around his early 20’s, but well before 25.  <br />
“If that’s hard to keep looking that good, don’t hesitate to come back to the shop for me to touch it up.” The Barber said.  “Speaking of that, don’t hesitate to cum now to.”<br />
As the newly created black man shot his load into the air, the two young men came back into the shop with their ice cream cones.<br />
“What the fuck Andre?” Huck yelled in his highest pitch voice yet. “What kind of role model material that?”<br />
“Always telling us to watch out and here you are shooting your load just like we did 10 minutes… oh crap.”<br />
“Did I hear you right.” The woman, now a man, now called Andre said putting his dick back in his pants and zipping up. “I left you hear to get hair cuts for your court appearances and you jacked off instead.”<br />
“No, no, look we got the hair cuts.  He did a great job.  Just like he did on you…….. And after wards we jacked off.”<br />
“Yes, well you both look fine.  As for my behavior, I have to apologize.  Running around with these two all day, knowing I can’t touch as long as their clients, well…. Things tend to get a bit pent up.”<br />
“As long as we’re clients?  Does that mean as soon as we win our court case and get enlisted you’ll take that crowbar out of your ass and let us throw you a fuck?”<br />
“I’d ask what kind of animals raised you Ramone but I’ve met your parents and I pity them.”<br />
“I think we all do.” Chimed in Huck who popped the last of his ice cream cone into his mouth.<br />
“Shut up Bitch.”<br />
“Gentlemen I want to thank you for coming in today and letting me cut your hair.  Extra added responses to them not withstanding.  I wish you luck with your attempt to serve this country as should be your right at very well bodies citizens.”<br />
“Hey, we’re not going to win but if we can reach some kid in the middle of no where and give him or her the message that they don’t have to conform to what society thinks is best for them, them we’re won half the battle.”<br />
“Do we have to go on Larry King though?  I’d rather do Chris what his name on Hardball and ask him if there’s truth in advertising.”<br />
“Get you ass out of the store now Huck.”<br />
<br />
