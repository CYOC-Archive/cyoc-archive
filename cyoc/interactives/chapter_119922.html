<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frank wa the first on to class for the final period of the day. <br />
<br />
He walked into class and sat down in his normal seat not seeing the note lying on it. He saw it as he was opening his books and decided to read it.<br />
<br />
To my new friend,<br />
<br />
You’re not happy with who you are, are you? Here&#39;s a game to make a change in your life. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.<br />
<br />
“Why not?,&quot; he thought. <br />
<br />
He took a pen out of his pack with some trepidation and started the survey.<br />
<br />
1. If you were a girl, would your handwriting be nice?<br />
<br />
As nice as it can be with how fast I write. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t notice that his handwriting was no longer his unreadable scribble but was still a little sloppy, but distinctly female. <br />
<br />
2. If you were a girl, would you like pink?&quot;<br />
<br />
No, blue is better. <br />
<br />
His pen changed to a nice light blue. <br />
<br />
3. If you were a girl, would your hair be straight or curly?<br />
<br />
I would want it to be long and straight.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t notice his usually very short hair becoming long, soft, and light on his head.<br />
<br />
4. If you were a girl, what would your favorite color be?<br />
<br />
Baby blue, of course. <br />
<br />
Nothing Changed. <br />
<br />
5. If you were a girl, what color would your hair be and how would you wear it?<br />
<br />
My hair would be a medium blonde in a fancy pony tail. <br />
<br />
Quickly the hair that just grew on his head, without him noticing, formed into a pony tail with a small braid going towards his left ear.  <br />
<br />
6. If you were a girl, what color would your eyes be?<br />
<br />
As deep blue as they are now. <br />
<br />
Nothing changed. <br />
<br />
7. If you were a girl, what kind of skin color and what kind of complexion would you have?<br />
<br />
My skin color would be slightly tan and wouldn&#39;t get darker due to my Swedish heritage. <br />
<br />
He shivered as his skin shifted, becoming more feminine and his normally pale self turned to a light shade of tan. <br />
<br />
8. If you were a girl, would you be sporty?&quot;<br />
<br />
Absolutely! Volleyball in the fall and soccer and track in the spring and summer. <br />
<br />
His normally pudgy body slowly shifted into a slim athletic build for a high school girl. <br />
<br />
9. If you were a girl, would you wear dresses and skirts<br />
<br />
Sometime, but almost exclusively for formal occasions. Mostly athletic short shorts or leggings. <br />
<br />
His khaki pants that he wore almost everyday turned into a bright blue pair of athletic shorts that hugged his newformed and toned ass in all the right places. With this his legs became slender, long and hairless, shown all the more off by his new shorts. <br />
<br />
10. If you were a girl, will you wear high heels?<br />
<br />
Yes, but only for formal occasions . Usually I wear trainers or a pair of flip flops.<br />
<br />
Still oblivious to what was happening, his feet shrank and his normal running shoes turned into a bright blue trainers in a girly style. <br />
<br />
11. If you were a girl, will you wear jewelry?<br />
<br />
Yes, I would wear small diamond earnings and a pair of bracelets on my left arm. <br />
<br />
All of the sudden his ears were pierced and he noticed a pair of silver bracelets on his left wrist where his watch would normally be. <br />
<br />
He then realized his lower half was now completely feminine and started to freak out in his mind. <br />
<br />
Then all the note said was &quot;finish or you will be stuck like this, being a girl isn&#39;t a bad thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, shit,&quot; he thought, just noticing the pony tail as he scratched his head. &quot;Not that I want to, but it&#39;s better than being halfway a guy,&quot; <br />
<br />
He continued on as the note changed its tone. <br />
<br />
12. When you are a girl, would you have any other accessories like glasses or hairbands?<br />
<br />
A pair of stylish glasses that I only need for reading and looking cute. <br />
<br />
13. When you are a girl, what size breasts will you have?<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we are getting real,&quot; he thought. <br />
<br />
Between a B and C cup. Big, but not in the way during sports. <br />
<br />
A pair of small C cups formed underneath the t shirt he was wearing. <br />
<br />
14. When you are a girl, what kind of bra will you wear?<br />
<br />
All kinds, but mostly sports bras as i usually have practice every day. <br />
<br />
A blue sports bra appeared around his new boobs that matched his shorts and shoes. <br />
<br />
15. When you are a girl, will you be attracted to guys?<br />
<br />
I dunno, pick for me. <br />
<br />
He was in for a good surprise later as the girls were scrimmaging the boys at soccer practice later. <br />
<br />
16. When you are a girl, what kind of shirt will you be wearing?<br />
I would be wearing a tight white v-neck shirt that slightly shows my bright blue sports bra. <br />
<br />
He looked down to see slight cleavage coming out of his low cut v-neck. The blue bra became visible through the thin fabric. <br />
<br />
17. When you are a girl, will you use tampons or a pad?<br />
<br />
I wear pads on most days but if I&#39;m playing sports I wear a tampon for convenience.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t see it coming on this question, but he felt it as soon as his manhood turned into full womanhood. He was now a she. <br />
<br />
18. When you are a girl, what kind of underwear will you wear?<br />
<br />
Thongs or nothing with leggings and spandex shorts under my shorts. <br />
<br />
A pair of spandex quickly hugged her new bum and vagina. <br />
<br />
19. When you are a girl, what will your intelligence be on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being a ditzy bimbo and 10 driving the class nerd up the wall)?<br />
<br />
7. Not super smart, but intelligent enough to play sports in college. <br />
<br />
20. When you are a girl, will you wear makeup?<br />
<br />
Just enough, but not too much. <br />
<br />
Her face became female and extremely beautiful. <br />
<br />
25. When you are a girl, what is your age, height without shoes and weight without clothes?<br />
<br />
I&#39;m 5&#39;10&quot;, and 125 lbs. I&#39;m 17 years old. <br />
<br />
21. When you are a girl, what sort of libido will you have?<br />
<br />
Average. Have experimented, but am still a virgin. <br />
<br />
“Okay last question.” she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
27. Final question. When you are a girl, what will your name be?<br />
<br />
Kelsey or Kels for short. <br />
<br />
After she wrote her name, “If you want to have a happy life as a girl, pass this on to the next person. Boy or Girl, don&#39;t matter.” Appeared at the bottom of the page.<br />
<br />
She left the note back on the desk as the final bell rang. Not knowing she had been staring at the note all class, Kelsey quickly got up and headed to soccer practice.</p>
