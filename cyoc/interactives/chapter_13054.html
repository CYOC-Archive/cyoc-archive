<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim woke up around 9:30 that morning. He had no school since it was the weekend, and he basically didn’t have anything to do. He rolled out of bed; he brushed his teeth, showered and then got dressed wearing just shorts, t-shirt, and his flip-flops.<br />
<br />
Tim decided that it was fun to hang out with his new friends. He was new in town and he didn’t know anybody except for the boys he had met at school the previous day, including Ty, Peter, and Allen. Peter had allowed Tim to join the swim team, where he got to meet Allen. Allen, of course, already had the ability to change Peter and grow his muscles whenever he wanted to, but now he had a new “victim” and he wanted the ability to change Tim as well, especially since the boy was relatively new on the swim team and he didn’t swim that well during the first practice session at the pool.<br />
<br />
Tim picked up the phone and dialed the number which Peter had written on a piece of paper, and Ty was the one who answered the phone.<br />
<br />
“Hey Tim, how’s going?” Ty said to him. <br />
<br />
“I’m doing alright! What are you guys doing today?” Tim asked Ty.<br />
<br />
“A couple of us are heading to the mall. Would you like to join us?” Ty asked him. “There are several places in the mall which sell video games, and they also have a large game arcade there. Would you like to check it out?”<br />
<br />
“Sure…” Tim replied excitedly. “How do I get there?”<br />
<br />
“Give me your address, and we’ll just meet you at your house…” Ty instructed.<br />
<br />
Tim went ahead and gave Ty his address and Ty was happy to see that they were relatively close to one another. <br />
<br />
About twenty minutes later, Ty and Allen came knocking on Tim’s front door. Tim was already dressed and ready to go, and the three boys walked over to the bus stop where they caught the very next bus to the mall.<br />
<br />
When they arrived, they immediately went to the food court area, where there were about two-dozen small fast-food restaurants, surrounding a large, open area with dozens of tables and chairs.<br />
<br />
Peter was already walking around the mall, and Tim was rather astonished when he saw that he walked up to Ty and he knew exactly where they were to be found, even though he wasn’t carrying a cell phone with him.<br />
<br />
The boys stood in line at a popular hamburger place, where they each bought their favorite order of hamburgers and French fries, along with their favorite soft drinks.<br />
<br />
Peter and Ty ordered the same thing, and they were busy pouring a large quantity of ketchup over their hamburgers and their fries, while Tim and Allen just ordered a hamburger and some ice cream instead of fries.<br />
<br />
When they were finished eating, they wandered around the shopping mall, until Ty and Peter decided that they wanted to go to the large sporting goods store, while Allen and Tim wanted to check out the video game arcade instead.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t we meet you guys in Arcade World after we come out of the shoe store?” Peter suggested to them. Allen and Tim went to the video arcade, and they planned on meeting Ty and Peter later.<br />
<br />
Peter and Ty went to “Goldman’s”, which was a large sports store, located near the center of the large shopping mall. Ty wanted a new pair of flip-flops, while Peter went looking for the newest pair of basketball shoes.<br />
<br />
When they both had their shoes on their feet, they walked around and evaluated whether they wanted to keep them or not.<br />
<br />
“Hey, we both wear the same size shoes, right?” Ty remarked, when he was looking at the side of the box which contained Peter’s new basketball shoes.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, we both have men’s size 11 shoes…” Peter noted.<br />
<br />
“Well, I’ve never seen you wear anything else than basketball shoes!” Ty chuckled. “How about we switch, just to see what it’s like?”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, saw his basketball shoes turn into flip-flops, and Ty’s flip-flops transformed into Peter’s basketball shoes.<br />
<br />
“I can’t play basketball in these!” Peter said, as he walked around the store wearing the flip-flops which Ty had selected.<br />
<br />
“Hey, these shoes are pretty cool!” Ty said, as he tried out Peter’s basketball shoes. “But I wouldn’t want to wear these every day!”<br />
<br />
“Can I have my new shoes back, please?” Peter said to his cousin, who was still admiring Peter’s new shoes.<br />
<br />
“Yes, these are pretty good.” Ty confirmed. “Let’s switch back…”<br />
<br />
The shoes magically switched back, as the flip-flops on Peter’s feet transformed back into his high tops while Peter’s basketball shoes had transformed back into the flip-flops on Ty’s feet.<br />
<br />
Both boys walked over to the cashier, where they ended up paying for their new shoes, while Allen and Tim were already playing games in the video game arcade.<br />
<br />
There was a large group of teens chatting outside the entrance to Arcade World, which was the large video arcade at the shopping mall. Kids were constantly walking in and out of the store, and there was one cash register where kids were lining up with Dollar bills, hoping to exchange their money for those valuable game tokens, which almost seemed more important than money itself.<br />
<br />
Allen and Tim had decided to split about three Dollars worth of quarters and they each netted exactly six tokens. They started playing their video games, and they were both playing different versions of the popular pinball game. Tim was playing one game after the other, while Allen continued to play the same game over and over again, up to the point where he was earning several extra balls, allowing him to extend his game session with almost twice the number of balls that you would normally get when playing the game.<br />
<br />
 Allen was reaching and breaking several of the high scores while playing, while Tim was alternating between three different games. At one point, he had just inserted his token in one game, which was just a few feet away from where the game was that Allen was playing so well at.<br />
<br />
“Holy cow! Check this out, Tim! “I’m about to pass the high score!” Allen cheered, as he was watching his score increase on the display screen.<br />
<br />
“Really? Let me see…” Tim said, as he walked over to where Allen was standing. <br />
<br />
Just as Tim was standing besides Allen, another boy walked up to the pinball machine that Tim was about to play, and the boy started playing the game instead of Tim!<br />
<br />
The boy was a playing on the high school’s football team, and he looked like it, too. He was big and stocky, he looked like he easily could have weighed over 300 pounds, he was about 6’6” tall and he looked like a giant.<br />
<br />
“Hey! You’re playing my game!” Tim shouted, as he saw the big boy play his game, just as Tim had walked over to see Allen play. “I just put my token in there!”<br />
<br />
“Too late, pal” the giant boy replied in a baritone voice. “I’m playing it now!”<br />
<br />
“But, that was my token!” Tim shouted back. “You’re playing my game! You owe me a token!”<br />
<br />
The big boy completely ignored Tim, and continued his game, until he lost his third ball. He then turned around, and started to walk away.<br />
<br />
“Hey, you big lug! You owe me a token!” Tim shouted after him, loud enough so that several people could hear him.<br />
<br />
The giant then stopped and turned around to face Tim. Tim knew right away that he was in trouble, since the 6 foot tall Tim was no match for the giant, who was 6 inches taller and a hundred pounds heavier.<br />
<br />
“And if I don’t, then what are you going to do about it?” the boy growled back at him, as he continued to walk towards Tim.<br />
<br />
Tim started to become scared, as he suddenly found the giant standing right before him.<br />
<br />
“You big bully!” Tim shouted. “Give me my token back, or else!”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah?” the giant boy grunted back. “Or else, what?”<br />
<br />
Allen was still playing his game, but he heard Tim’s voice and he realized that his buddy was in big trouble. Luckily, he was playing his last ball, and he noticed that he had already passed the high score for the game on that pinball machine.<br />
<br />
“Or else… or else…” Tim stuttered, realizing that there really wasn’t much he could do to the kid who was bigger, taller, and stronger than him.<br />
<br />
Allen had just finished playing his game, and he was happy when the machine had registered his score as the new high score on the machine. <br />
<br />
But when he turned to look for Tim, he saw that the big boy had already grabbed Tim by the shirt collar, and he started to pull him towards him in a threatening way.<br />
<br />
“Oh uh… I guess Tim needs my help…” Allen whispered to himself.<br />
<br />
“I wish Tim would grow another foot taller and that he would also gain two-hundred pounds of muscle in the next thirty seconds!” Allen wished out loud.<br />
<br />
“Hey Butch,” another kid said to the big boy, “Just let the little guy go! There’s another game over there that I want you to try…”<br />
<br />
“Hold on…” Butch said to him. ‘I need to take care of some business and I need to make sure this little twerp will stop bugging me about some stupid game token that I DON’T OWE HIM AT ALL!!” <br />
<br />
Before Butch could say another word, Tim started to grow! Tim felt his body change, but he couldn’t look down, because the big bully was still holding on to his shirt.<br />
<br />
Tim felt his legs; his arms and torso expand, as the room seemed to shrink while the floor started to lower as he continued to grow.<br />
<br />
“What the heck?” Butch shouted, as he began to notice that Tim was growing noticeable taller than he was only a few moments before!<br />
<br />
Tim was now the same height as Butch, but the growing didn’t just stop there. <br />
<br />
The expression on Tim’s face changed from one of fear to one of confidence, as he was slowly starting to pass Butch in height!<br />
<br />
Not only that, but Tim felt his muscles suddenly expand as well, as his pectorals started filling up his shirt, making him feel uncomfortable. His calves inflated and so did his biceps, and within seconds, Butch was forced to let go of Tim when he realized that Tim was now bigger, taller and more muscular than him!<br />
<br />
“Hey… How did you suddenly grow so fast?” Butch gasped, as he now found himself looking up to the bigger Tim.<br />
<br />
Allen just chuckled, as he looked on from a distance. He was ready to jump in whenever necessary, but he realized that Tim was doing just fine on his own.<br />
<br />
“Now, Butch…” Tim said, as he placed his hands on his hips. “Let’s talk about my token…”<br />
<br />
Butch took several steps back, before he grabbed a token out of his shirt pocket and threw it right at Tim, who caught it with his giant hands. Butch then turned around, and quickly marched out of the store, without even looking back.<br />
<br />
“I got my token back!” Tim cheered, before he turned around and saw Allen standing there with a wide grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“You did great, big guy!” Allen laughed. “You took care of Butch!”<br />
<br />
Tim just smiled, although he was astonished and amazed by his sudden growth spurt.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know how you were able to make me grow…” Tim smiled. “But it felt great!!”<br />
<br />
Just when Ty and Peter walked into the arcade, they both gasped when they realized how big Tim had become!<br />
<br />
“Allen! What did you do to him?” Ty wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“I allowed him to grow a little bit, so he could take care of a bully!”<br />
<br />
All four boys laughed when Allen told them what he had done to Tim!<br />
<br />
The boys played games as they hung out at the mall, with Tim being the tallest guy in the group for the rest of the afternoon.</p>
