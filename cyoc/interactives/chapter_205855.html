<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just like before, that sudden recklessness rises as he grabs the bracelet out of her hand and slides it on. Another display appearing as the researcher&#39;s phone starts to ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;One moment, wait here.&quot;<br />
<br />
She answers it, leaving the room as Douglas waits with the unconscious Yrk. Idly watching the orcs chest rise and fall... it&#39;s perfect. He could snuggle against it. Be enveloped by the monsters&#39; strong arms and become an orc himself. Start the tribe off right, spread...<br />
<br />
A sudden fatigue washes over the human as the bracelet starts to tighten. Stumbling forward as he tries to rebalance himself. Falling over the table and onto the orc&#39;s hard chest. Drifting off into well-deserved sleep as he snuggles against the brute...<br />
<br />
When he opens his eyes, Douglas is in a completely different room. Naked, and bound to a chair. Metal straps across his arms and legs. Bracelet still tightly attached. His seating having a hole underneath his rear, letting his ass be exposed to the rooms cool air. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s a pure white room otherwise, the ceiling looks to be segmented into tiles, as is the floor. Only a single door leads in and out. White like the rest of this place, with no handle. Automated if he had to guess, and his guess was correct as the door slid opened. The same man in a singlet from earlier stepping into the room, looking around before giving Douglas a cheeky grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You almost got passed me mate. Good work!&quot;<br />
&quot;What gave me away.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just checked the security cameras. Saw an opportunity getting you when Matilda slipped that bracelet on.&quot;<br />
<br />
He grumbles.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, she tricked me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Nah, she had no clue. Had to call her out and take over.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man laughs as he circles around his captive. The only sound heard being his footsteps, the researcher assessing every aspect of his target as he crosses his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could use a bloke like you. Strong, cunning, and with a lot of information we&#39;d kill to have.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ain&#39;t interested.&quot;<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon mate-&quot;<br />
&quot;FUCK OFF!&quot;<br />
<br />
That surge of aggressive hits Douglas again. He tries to keep calm and collected, but these outburts just keep happening. Why can&#39;t he contain it? Has he really been screwed since turning into an orc? Though his irritation leads to further joy from his tormentor. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it. Exactly what I&#39;m wanting to see. You&#39;ll be one of us, a higher up in fact. We just need to make some adjustments... and get some more research notes with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ground underneath his seat disappears. Hiding away as something rising from below. Another creature bound in a seat, an orc, Yrk. The brute tied in the same manner though currently unconscious, sliding underneath Douglas&#39;s seat. Cock perfectly positioned to go through the chairs hole and into his ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yrk, mate. Look who it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
The orcs eyes slowly open, he strains against the bindings for a few moments before spotting Douglas. Like all prior times, having his cock rise up. Though now it starts to poke against his rear end. Threatening to pierce inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU-&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas goes to make a command to the orc, but all that comes out is a grunt of pain. Yrk&#39;s seat suddenly moved further up. Forcing its entry into the human&#39;s wide hole. The two connected in this moment, orcish instincts clouding both men&#39;s minds as the researcher watches and more enter the room. Writing on notepads or devices as bliss overtakes the men.<br />
<br />
&quot;Note every detail. This works and we&#39;ll be repeating it on any promising workers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yrk&#39;s chair goes down and up once more. Pulling out then into the man. Feeling his hole widen for the orcs impressive girth, while Douglas feels each of the orcs pubes grind against his rear end. Both lost as this motion repeats with more intensity. Balls slapping against Douglas&#39;s skin. The human&#39;s own cock barely able to contain the sensation as it sprays itself empty, seed lost in the abyss below the two of them. With his human load emptied his journey to orchood truly begins. Douglas feeling that newfound might once more. The chair expanding with his form. Spreading out to hold his colossal arms and stout neck. readjusting as his mind simplifies and gives in to each and every instinct before him. Though now there is one new thing intruding his mind.<br />
<br />
As he feels himself turning, he looks to the researchers in the room. Purpose finding him, reason that he had always needed. These smart men and women, they were his people. He had to protect them, to use this growing muscle to beat away anyone who would ever harm them! If someone betrayed them, he would make them loyal like he now is!<br />
<br />
Douglas&#39;s groans become deeper as Yrk fully exits his ass. His seat descending further down then before, and then racing back up with incredible speed. Slamming one last time into the changing man, as rivers of cum are pumped into his rear. Absorbed by his very being and finalising the changes. Adding the remaining muscles and final hairs. Removing any lingering restraint to make way for recklessness and confidence. Euphoria hitting both men as they bask in the afterglow. Doug&#39;s mouth agape, as a pump descends from the ceiling and forces itself down his throat.<br />
<br />
The former human almost chokes on the intrusion, though his new body is quick to respond to the situation. Letting the tube tickle his throat as it descends down, pouring a steady flow of liquid as it sets to rest. The taste is familiar to him, the fog caused by sex starting to clear as he involuntarily struggles in his seat. Yrk separated from his lover, forced to watch as the muscle mass he gave shrinks down to a more humanlike build. Still impressive for any human, but far from the obscene bulk he once had. The heavy coating of hairs dying to a thick spreading across his pecs and arms. His squared head taking a more circular shape with tusks barely jutting out of his mouth. His mind once more his own, though a new aggressiveness and confidence washes over him. The pipe exiting the same way it entered, while Doug looks to the crowd. Coughing up the remaining liquid, then staring to them all.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING TO ME!&quot;<br />
&quot;Told you mate, we&#39;re making you one of us. Don&#39;t you want to help our company?&quot;<br />
<br />
While before there was pure disgust, there&#39;s now a foreign willingness. Some strange respect for these researchers, and strange joy in the work they do. His hand forming a fist as he yells back.<br />
<br />
&quot;GO FUCK YOURSELF!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hah, need to work on you a bit more then. Sure you&#39;ll change your tune when you&#39;re a half-orc.&quot;<br />
<br />
The older man looks to ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Repeat the process.&quot;</p>
