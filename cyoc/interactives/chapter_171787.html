<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachael felt herself shifting again, her whole body, not just certain areas. She looked around, she looked at the bull man. He was huge, or at least he used to be huge, now she was around similar eye level as him. She looked around again, everyone, everything was smaller. She was bigger.<br />
<br />
She looked down again to see if she could spot if her feet were noticeably bigger, she struggled to do so with her massive boobs in the way. Massive boobs!?<br />
Rachael watched as everything around her shrunk, she grew, but different from her body, growing at a different rate, her breasts were becoming ginormous, they were already half the size of her head, and still growing.<br />
She didn’t know what to do, she was close to passing out due to sheer panic, but she held on, she wasn’t sure why. Then she began to feel her thighs touching, that wasn’t something that ever happened. She bent over, her increasingly larger boobs in the way, she gazed through her expanding cleavage and saw, her thighs were bigger. She bent her head backwards, turning it to see her butt, her butt was massive. It was growing like her breasts were. She took a quick break from looking at her assets to look at everyone in the room. They were so much smaller. The bull man would’ve been around boob height on her if he was standing up. She looked back at her breasts, they were now the size of her head, growing bigger as she watched. She looked again at her butt, it was sticking out further than most shelves shed seen. She looked again at her breasts, they were almost a third bigger than when she looked at them a second before. She watched as they grew to the size of her head and a half. She looked again at her butt, even bigger. Becoming even rounder than a semicircle.<br />
She looked around, only a couple people were watching. Usually she would hate people watching her do anything anywhere, but she was quite confused as to why people weren’t watching. It’s not like they see a girl turn into a big boobed giant everyday... or maybe they did.<br />
Her clothes were holding on quite well, her skirt was particularly good considering it held together-<br />
Spoke too soon, three individual tears broke through, exposing a portion of her left cheek, her right cheek, and a tiny bit of both in one. She attempted to cover up, but her butt was so big that she couldn’t reach around. She gave up, I mean, she wouldn’t mind a couple of individuals looking at her ass... what was she thinking!? This was so out of character for her, she couldn’t believe herself. She’d been single for her entire life because she had no desire to sexualise herself. But now, what was going on, these new sensations, new feelings, new emotions, new... desires. With that thought, she looked at her top, it hadn’t torn yet, but she could start to see the outline of her nipples. They looked to be just under the size of her hand, they were huge. Speaking of huge, her boobs were now past the point of twice the size of her head, they were now two heads and a half.<br />
Then, it began to slow down. Her boobs only grew a tiny bit bigger, the same applied to her ass. She looked around, the bull man would have stood just under where her butt started, if he reached up high enough he could give them a big squeeze... no! Why was she thinking like this. All she ever wanted to was to live alone and get fucked by every woman and man in this room... NO!!<br />
Rachael placed her hands on her head, she closed her eyes, she was so... so... so ready to have some fun!<br />
<br />
She fell to her knees, she snapped her fingers, the bartender immediately gave her a glass of some sort of green alcoholic liquid.<br />
She was ready to have the best. Night. Of. Her. Life.<br />
<br />
Then the doors slammed, locked outside, Rachael inside doing anything she wanted without the feeling of judgement, going against anything she had ever said.<br />
“Hey,” the doorman said,<br />
It was quiet, not even a faint sound of what was going on inside was heard,<br />
“Hey, you!” The doorman said again, “I’m talking to YOU directly. The reader.”<br />
The doorman looked right into your eyes, you feel nothing but lust for him, he is undeniably the most attractive thing you’ve ever seen.<br />
“We both know what’s going on in there.” He says, “don’t worry about replying, I know you would if you could. Just wait here, I mean this is just a chapter in on a website, right? All you gotta do is press that next chapter and you’ll be wherever the next writer sends you. Maybe you’ll see what’s going on in there, or maybe you’ll just see the aftermath of it all, what do I know, I don’t see the future,” he finishes and chuckles to himself. He seems to fade out of existence, into nothing but words in a chapter. So where do we go next?</p>
