<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Letting her mother/husband to her walk down memory lane, Jenny entered her mother&#39;s home office. The teenage redhead used to do her homework with her boyfriend as much as she could, which wasn&#39;t really often since her mother hadn&#39;t approved of her relationship with Jeff. In fact, before said teenage boy took over her body, Shannon would never have approved of any boyfriend. But since Jeff made his own the body of the over protective mother, Jenny had taken the habit of doing her homework in the office her ‘love and mother’ had at home. It was rare for said person to not be there after work, so it usually let Jenny ask for help when needed.<br />
<br />
Upon entering her mother&#39;s office, Jenny noticed a new and strange little computer posed next to the usual one, which it seemed to be connected to. Curious the young redhead looked at it and discovered it claimed to be a reality altering device named a Chronivac. Thinking it was just some sort of simulation game, she searched it its interface for the parameters. Doing so, she saw what it claimed Jeff had done to reality and how it had been before but, even once she temporarily restored her awareness of the old reality she wasn&#39;t phased by the modifications her husband had done to reality. If anything, she was flattered he would go that far for her. She acknowledged it may be because she still was the Jenny of this new reality, even with the memories from her counterpart from the old one, and that it was entirely possible the ‘old her’ would have found it disturbing in not outright disgusting, but she didn&#39;t care for the opinion of that other version of herself.<br />
<br />
That said, the fact a superior being, a God, existed was something that disturbed her and profoundly hurt her convictions.<br />
<br />
So using the ‘link’ Software joining the Chronivac to the computer next to it, she entered that rather than made by God, a ‘divine wedding’ was caused by some sort of biological function between two peoples who would be the perfect lovers for each other, and not only for the physical part. In fact, homosexual couples were just as likely to happen through a ‘divine wedding’.<br />
<br />
Then she changed her own family&#39;s history. She now only had one older sister, a brilliant doctor named Emilia O&#39;Brian, and had been old enough when her father died to have known him.<br />
<br />
Turning someone into a parasite, like had been done to Jeff, was now a medical procedure done to peoples with a genetic defect that can&#39;t be survived past 20 without taking over someone else body. Normally that procedure it&#39;s not done before 18 and a parasite is always given a body of the same sex, but there was special circumstances. Someone wanted Shannon O&#39;Brian dead to the point of injecting her with an unknown and fast acting poison, and the O&#39;Brian sisters needed somebody they could trust taking over their mother&#39;s body and life, to have any hope of knowing what really happened and have the one responsible brought to justice.<br />
<br />
Once all this was done, she added that there never was any God, regardless of what humanity used to believe, the name ‘divine wedding’ being a remnant of those old beliefs.<br />
<br />
Then Jenny got an idea. She always loved fantasy, wished of a story in a modern-like fantasy setting, and knew it was the same for Jeff. Plus, she could use it to make the dream of most girl to become a reality for herself and turn into a princess.<br />
<br />
First, she made elves and dwarves existed along humans and that all 3 races were genetically compatibles. Then, she changed things so the time of dinosaurs was instead the time of dragons, a species of giant, fire breathing flying reptiles as intelligent as humans, elves and dwarves, who disappeared just the way dinosaurs had in the old reality. Somehow a lone dragon survived, but became immortal in the process.<br />
<br />
Said dragon love the 3 intelligent races that eventually emerged in the new world, endeared by how similarly to his old kind they were thinking. He tried to bring his wisdom and knowledge to all of them, but not everyone accepted. Those that did installed themselves on a rather big archipelago comprised of one big central island half the size of Australia, and lot of small to medium islands around it. (Somehow, changing history so much totally changed the world&#39;s geography.) The Dragon refused to be more than a counselor to his archipelago&#39;s intelligent inhabitants, so he choose someone he could trust to govern the lands since then known as the Draklo empire, his best-friend, a man he trusted so much he made a blood-sharing ritual with him, which had given powers to him and his descendants.<br />
<br />
For generations the family of the first Draklon emperor served the country well, protecting the nation and taking care of its habitant. But the last generations mistreat the population and were only thinking of their own gain, but discretely enough to avoid detection by the dragon. Until a reporter named Shannon O&#39;Brian gathered proofs and was about to publish it. Somehow the imperial family learned of it and poisoned her. Thankfully, her daughter Emilia was able to save her mother by turning her sister&#39;s boyfriend into a parasite and making him took over Shannon&#39;s body and life, making sure her report was published.<br />
<br />
Mad that the descendants of his best-friend betrayed their own peoples, he striped them of the magical powers he had granted their ancestor so long ago. But the inhabitants of Draklo came to equal being their ruler as having dragon blood, and wouldn&#39;t accept anyone that didn&#39;t have any drop of dragon in their veins as their leader. And so the dragon needed someone he could trust to be fair and just to the Draklon peoples to do the blood sharing ritual once more. (It&#39;s more like a magical adoption than actual blood sharing.)<br />
<br />
It the end, he concluded that the entity known as both Shannon O&#39;Brian and Jeffrey Laforet was the ideal candidate, and the former journalist became the new empress. Because of the magical nature of the Blood Sharing, all of Shannon&#39;s children where also affected, gaining the powers that always came with being a member of Draklo&#39;s imperial family, among which was being able to switch between her good old human form and a draconic one.<br />
<br />
Then Jenny added one last thing to her programing of the Chronivac. Not only did she forget its very existence, but Jeff also forget he ever used it after receiving it, and so did the Chronivac itself, its historic now completely empty.</p>
