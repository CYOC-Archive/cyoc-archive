<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Day 6 - and both Neil and Max were sure that something was going on. Past the point where either might be willing to accept a little oddity in the name of furthering their gains. By the time the two went in and waited for Bradley to commence their workout, they could see that there was a tension in the air. A decided difference that seemed to have eaten away at the facade that &quot;nothing was wrong&quot; and &quot;we&#39;re just seeing our results a little faster&quot;. Even as Neil and Max awaited their workout with Bradley, they were able to see the oncoming effects within themselves - and without, in those around them.<br />
<br />
The gym jocks and guys from the football team among others who usually maintained a stoic, ready distance between themselves were it seems sending coded glances at one another, unsure of their positions, and contemplating it seemed some sort of message. A sense of curiosity was rippling through the gym. A sense of curiosity, then, that Neil was now vastly more accustomed to even as he realized that it was both foreign and not exactly his &quot;normal&quot;.<br />
<br />
This was something well beyond the usual thirst for the attention of female gymgoers and others that he experienced. Shifting awkwardly in his seat, Neil had to admit he got the idea. Max was really, really looking pretty good today, and it seemed already like just spending time in here was making that impression even better. Neil could truly feel that sense of strange, queer curiosity toward Max - what would it feel like, then, to kiss Max? To feel his body and pin him against the wall of the gym locker room...?<br />
<br />
To have them feel each other&#39;s muscles, and talk about how hot the women here were in between smashing their lips together...?<br />
<br />
Sweat pooled on the top of Neil&#39;s brow, and dripped down toward his eyes. He gripped his knees in his hands, registering as he did the way his biceps and forearms flexed with muscle during that. He knew there was never anything that was given away for free. You never get something for nothing, Neil, that was what his dad always said. And now he realized how true that was. He still felt his cock give an interested jerk in the direction of thought toward Sandra...<br />
<br />
But now he felt this sort of curiosity that seemed to be shared by others who attended the gym quite so regularly. Neil realized that his body was pushing beyond merely that of a model into the realm of a bodybuilder. He was bigger, he realized, than he had ever thought he&#39;d be. And he still wanted more. He wanted to flex, and have men and women both lust for the body that had attained so much work and due diligence from him. Sure he was an amateur in comparison to some men in here, but fuck he was still really amazingly big.<br />
<br />
Neil&#39;s blond hair seemed thicker, more luscious, like he applied some bit more product to it. His jawline he saw as he looked in the window by the seats...his jawline was so much stronger, broader, and made him look so very handsome. I&#39;d kiss me, Neil realized. Maybe. He was still feeling curious. Wondering what he was going to do with all this. He didn&#39;t know what he wanted, and that was the story of the gym today. Some people went a bit further.<br />
<br />
A pair of jocks Neil remembered from before whom had previously chuckled on about gay guys checking each other out were now helping each other squat heavier off in a corner. The one pressing his body up against the glutes and back of the other to keep him straight. Ironically enough considering that nothing about the erect cocks between the two, or their blush, indicated the slightest bit of one kind of straightness being preserved.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Neil,&quot; Max said - himself at his third day and still not quite as big, though his mix of muscle and fat seemed to get him looking at least rather impressive, &quot;Something seems different today...really different. Do you see it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah I do,&quot; Neil commented, wondering what it might be. He had isolated it down to one commonality factor - the fact they all went to this gym. It had to be the gym rather than any sort of thing with the water, &quot;And I can feel it, honestly. I can&#39;t say what exactly...but I just feel so...weird. It&#39;s like, I feel curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bi-Curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I&#39;m not <i>gay</i> or anything,&quot; Neil said slightly defensively, &quot;But I&#39;m just saying. I feel...curious. It&#39;s like, I see all this tension around here, and I wonder. I wonder how---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How it might feel to smooch a guy.&quot; Max teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Pretty much exactly,&quot; Neil answered, &quot;I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong. I want Sandra, and I still prefer women. But I just...I kinda wanna know what goes on on the other side of the grass. Grass looks greener effect, you know what I&#39;m saying man?&quot; A quick nod from Max and Neil continued, &quot;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m gonna quit going out with women. But I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m straight, you know.&quot; Max said, and Neil breathed - both feeling relieved and feeling kind of disappointed.<br />
<br />
He both knew now that it seemed there was a time component, and yet at the same time he felt let down that Max was precluding any sort of romantic interlude between the two of them. Had he no curiosity himself? It just...it seemed like the perfect time and place to---oh, might be the effects of the place again. Neil shook his head, &quot;Yeah, I kinda figured. Sorry. Just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Max nodded, &quot;We gotta figure out what&#39;s going on here, man---&quot; He trailed off and gaped when he saw Bradley approaching the waiting area, &quot;Holy shit, man.&quot; <br />
<br />
If the prior day Bradley had looked incredible, today he looked even further built up. The same shirt or the same kind of shirt that he had on yesterday was now pulled even tighter, and hugged to every single possible striation and muscle, the separation on his shoulders was...honestly insane, and the way his biceps almost tore his sleeves made Neil almost drool. Though Bradley seemed to be having some trouble with his clothes - his shorts seemed to be hugging tighter still, and he needed to adjust them by pulling at the fringes. His quads were thicker still, thighs larger, and his features seemed if possible more handsome still. It seemed his nipples pressed through the shirt and were visible right there through the fabric, pectoral shelf hanging above a strongly built set of abs that almost pushed outward on their own.<br />
<br />
Neil had never seen a man with such beautiful muscles, such a handsome face, and yet having so much trouble with his clothes. Max nudged Neil, &quot;You think he&#39;s---&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil&#39;s eyes darted and dipped to Bradley&#39;s shorts, seeing the fat crotch, &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Bradley approached them, he crossed his arms under his massive chest and said, &quot;Great to see you guys in here today. I think you guys are some of the most motivated and strong new gymgoers we&#39;ve had in quite a while. You&#39;ve obviously been pushing through it every day since you signed on, and I can really see all the gains coming in...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, we have a good inspiration...&quot; Neil said pointedly toward Bradley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I&#39;m honored guys. I mean, I work day in and day night to look as sexy---as good as I do.&quot; He blushed a little at his &quot;accidental&quot; turn of phrase. &quot;I mean if you guys wanna look as good as I do, that&#39;s great, though I&#39;d be even happier to see you get bigger than me.&quot;<br />
<br />
If that&#39;s possible, Neil contemplated. &quot;Well,&quot; Neil said, &quot;We&#39;re willing to do anything and everything in pursuit of fitness right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that kind of motivation is great to hear. I&#39;ll get you guys&#39; files started right now,&quot; Bradley stated, &quot;So we&#39;re gonna have consecutive workouts for the next five days, wherever and whenever you&#39;re able - this gym is best. Though obviously your schedule impacts this. So as far as fitness goals, I&#39;m just gonna put down bodybuilding, and looking good for the beach...got anyone you wanna impress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Neil didn&#39;t know how far it went. He wanted to say Sandra...but he also right now just as well wanted to say Bradley himself. &quot;There&#39;s...a-a woman. She goes here. Sandra...&quot; Neil bit his lip. He didn&#39;t want to just strike out with Bradley right from the get-go when he didn&#39;t even know if the changes were really going that far with him. And he didn&#39;t know if he was gonna keep on with this gym knowing what he did.<br />
<br />
He had to find out more before he could make that kind of judgement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me personally,&quot; Max said, &quot;I just wanna be looked at. I mean, you know, I&#39;ve gone pretty much invisible for most of my life as far as girls go. I want to be seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get that,&quot; Bradley nodded, &quot;Alright, you guys seem to have a lot of potential, and I&#39;m willing to take you the distance, if you&#39;re willing to put in the work. Does that sound good to you guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nods from both Neil and Max, and Bradley grinned, &quot;Great to hear. Now let&#39;s get the workout moving. We&#39;ll have an hour and five minutes to get this done. Let&#39;s start with your compound lifts and move on from there. You guys good with that?&quot; Neil and Max nodded excitedly and got up, beginning to follow Bradley out on to the workout floor.<br />
<br />
As weird as all of this was, Neil contemplated, at least for now he could concentrate on building up his muscles rather than anything of the strangeness surrounding him. Even as he contemplated trying for some sort of move on Bradley. The guy sure did seem like he was just growing and none too different from the prior day. He didn&#39;t want to just get brushed off...<br />
<br />
But at the same time he did now get a vibe from Bradley that he never quite got before...</p>
