<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>As they snacked at their favorite fast-food place, Jennifer kept thinking about the sex they were going to undoubtedly have tonight. Nathan was almost always in the mood, but Jennifer only agreed if she really felt like it, and tonight was definitely one of those nights.
<P>"You okay?" Nathan asked. "You've been quiet for a while."
<P>Jennifer shook her head to try and throw her lustful thoughts out of her mind. "Yeah, I'm fine."
<P>"Still thinking about what happened in school?"
<P>Jennifer nodded just to appease him.
<P>"Well, don't worry about it. I'll make sure nobody laughs at you in that class again."
<P>Jennifer was sure he meant it.
<P>That night they drove to his house, where his parents were out for the evening. It was the perfect scenario to fool around. Within five minutes of parking her car in the driveway, the lovers were already upstairs in Nathan's bed, completely naked.
<P>"Not so fast," Nathan said as she began thrusting against his hard member. "Let's enjoy this for a while."
<P>Usually Jennifer was a real tease. She'd drag their foreplay out to extremes until Nathan could barely stand it anymore. This time, she just wanted to get to the good part and experience another orgasm like the one she felt that morning.
<P>It came soon enough. Jennifer moaned in obnoxious satisfaction as Nathan came within her, and her own juices responded. It was unlike any other time they had done it together. The pure ecstasy was wonderful. Firecrackers exploded across her body, and her mind was rocked by pure bliss. For one perfect moment, she felt true pleasure.
<P>But it was all downhill from there. Even before Nathan had pulled out, Jennifer felt her happiness sink into a rut. She wanted to go back to that instant of bliss.
<P>Nathan laid down on his back next to her, hugging her tightly.
<P>"Want to go again?" Jennifer whispered. Had Nathan's eyes been open, he would have seen a child-like expectancy in her eyes that was uncharacteristic of Jennifer.
<P>"Mmmm...Not yet." He nuzzled her face with his cheek.
<P>"You sure?"
<P>"Jennifer Smith, you have never once agreed to have sex twice in one night. Now quiet down and make with the snuggling before you kill the afterglow."
<P>Jennifer hugged him and probed his sensitive areas the way she knew he liked it. She at least hoped he would fondle her in return, but he seemed merely content to rest a hand on her breast and stroke her hair. She pouted. Why couldn't he understand her need?
<P>That question only brought up more questions. Why was she so needy in the first place? Sex had never felt like that before, not with Nathan or anyone else. Why had she been anticipating it so much?
<P>She tried to come up with an answer, but the aftermath of their moment of perfect passion was too dominant in her mind. She finally allowed herself to get lost in the pleasant feelings it brought with it. It wasn't as good as the sensations of orgasm, but it would have to do.
<P>* * *
<P>Jennifer awoke to her alarm the next morning. She bolted upright, clutching the covers against her chest. She looked around for Nathan, but saw only her own bed and bedroom. How did she get here?
<P>Someone pounded on her door. The muffled voice of the housekeeper could be heard over the din of her alarm. "Jennifer, are you awake? Turn that thing off!"
<P>Jennifer reached over and shut her alarm off. "I'm awake, I'm awake!" she called back.
<P>"Breakfast will be ready in fifteen minutes," Martha called. Jennifer then heard footsteps that grew fainter as Martha presumably headed downstairs to the kitchen.
<P>She returned her attention to last night. She tried to recall what happened after falling asleep next to Nathan. She must have been really groggy, because sorting the memories in her mind was taking a lot of her concentration. Finally, she recalled that Nathan had woken her up just before his parents got home. She had quickly gotten dressed and run out to her car so that his parents wouldn't catch her at their house so late. She had driven straight home, and then gone straight to bed.
<P>That meant she hadn't showered or even done her homework. In fact, she was still in her cheerleading top. Good thing she didn't have practice today.
<P>"Oh no!" she shouted. She was supposed to go to practice yesterday! How could she have forgotten? She was wearing the damn thing all day. Why hadn't Nathan said anything?
<P>"Stupid boyfriend," she thought as she quickly showered. "He is so dumped." The minute she thought about dumping him, however, she somehow remembered that one ecstatic moment during sex. She wanted to feel it again. The only way to get it, though, was to keep him on board. "One more day," she thought. "Just to see if last night wasn't a one-time fluke."
<P>She had eaten her breakfast and started out for her car when she remembered she had planned to masturbate that morning. There obviously wasn't time for it now. Maybe between classes. She revved up the engine and headed to school.
<P>* * *
<P>"Where were you yesterday?" Liz shouted. She and a couple other cheerleaders were waiting for Jennifer at her locker.
<P>"I'm so sorry," she said. "Something came up."
<P>"Was that something Nathan?" Liz asked. "Claire here saw you take off with him."
<P>Again, at the mention of Nathan, Jennifer's mind jumped right to sex. What was going on with her?
<P>"I'm waiting," Liz said menacingly.
<P>"I'm really very sorry," Jennifer said with as much truth as she could muster. She sort of regretted forgetting, but in her mind, it was worth it for that wild night. "I'll definitely be there tomorrow."
<P>"You'd better be. Or did you also forget there's a big game on Saturday?"
<P>It bothered her to admit it, but somehow in all of the excitement and confusion of the past twelve hours, she <i>had</i> forgotten about that. "I'll. Be. There." Jennifer said. She stared sharply into Liz's eyes.
<P>Liz gave a "Hmph!" and turned around. She and one of the other cheerleaders walked away, but Claire stayed.
<P>"I'm sorry, Jen. I shouldn't have told them I saw you yesterday."
<P>"It's okay. I'm the one at fault. I really should have been there for the team. See you around, all right?"
<P>Claire took off, leaving Jennifer alone with her locker. A locker that again proved hard to open.
<P>Jennifer growled as she spun the lock wildly. "What is that damn last number?!"</p>
