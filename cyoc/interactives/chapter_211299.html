<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Bo wiped himself down trying to clean off all the spilt milk as it were, he looked at himself in the mirror.  He couldn&#39;t believe that he had let that all happen.  He was the grownup for godsakes.  Andy was 18 but he was a kid and they were related.  Nothing he had done had been overtly sexual, except that he knew that it was.  He kept wiping the spots and dribbles of milk off of himself but he felt dirty.  Then, he froze.  <br />
<br />
Andy had completely locked the door to the store.  He had some major editing to do and he&#39;d need time to complete his work.  He felt his hardon stir in his pants.  He had enjoyed that but it was only just the beginning.  He was a little bit haunted by the way his uncle had looked at him after. But he wasn&#39;t going to let that knock him off course.  He knew in his mind and in his heart, he could type out and adjust enough in the Chronivac to make this all work out.  He hit the button to freeze his uncle and got to work.  <br />
<br />
Andy began retroactively editing the effects of Bo&#39;s cowish destiny on the family.  <br />
<br />
He worked for what had felt like hours typing and editing and reworking and then he pressed enter.  <br />
<br />
When Bo had realized that he needed to be milked and his parents had bought him the milking machine, they had been skeptical about whether or not the boy was actually producing real milk.   Bo had convinced them and after a while, the family had stopped buying milk at the store.  It was a quick and easy way to save money. <br />
<br />
The family of four began consuming the homemade product at least twice a day.  For a while, nothing happened but one night around midnight, the whole family had changed.  Maria Inez, Andy&#39;s grandmother had woken up around midnight with a tightness in her chest.  At first she was worried she was having a heart attack but as she stirred from her bed, the pressure moved with her.  Looking down, she had realized that her breasts had expanded going from a nice C cup to a huge H cup over night.  <br />
<br />
She had screamed.  <br />
<br />
Her husband, startled at the sound jumped out<br />
of bed  and turned on the lights.  He saw his wife and then he looked down at himself. His formerly modest penis was now a dark brown monstrosity.  It rested near his knees hugged uncomfortably tight by his white jockey shorts.  <br />
<br />
All the commotion had awoken Tomas and Roberto and they had come running into the room themselves.  Tomas afflicted in the same way as his father had been.  <br />
<br />
The family stood there in various states of undress, Maria&#39;s top completely blown out, Tomas and Javier half exposed and Roberto looking sick to his stomach.  After a while, the family had assessed their situation. Recognizing that none of them were injured, Javier had told his sons to go back to their rooms.  Javier had Maria lay down and lifting up her dress saw that his wife now had the long slit of a cow&#39;s vagina where her normal and familiar pussy had been only a day before.  The strong scent of her sex had pushed him to near instant arousal.  And they found themselves distracted from their mission of self assessment.  Soon Javier was thrusting deeply into her.  His own bull cock fully engorged and pounding.  <br />
<br />
Tomas himself was in his room doing his own examination.  Soon, all Bo could hear was the sounds of arousal and engagement throughout the house.   He had cried to himself that night. Wondering what he had done, feeling guilt, feeling like a monster. <br />
<br />
His father had woken him up that morning.  Breakfast had been made and his mother and brother were seated around the table.  Roberto had noticed that both his older brother and his father were wearing their baggiest sweatpants and his mother was wearing one of her father&#39;s sweatshirts.<br />
<br />
Roberto started a stammering apology but he hadn&#39;t been able to get anything out before his father, Javier had said, &quot;It&#39;s ok. We&#39;re all fine.&quot; The meal proceded as normal and then they began to discuss their plans for shopping and figuring out their new realities.  Clothes had been purchased that week and life went on. The family adapted to the situation almost seamlessly.  After all, they had to be examples to Roberto who had been different all along.  They got some strange looks and into some awkward situations but nothing too bad.  <br />
<br />
Except for Tomas.  The seventeen year old had been going steady with a local girl for about eight months. She and he had gone to the movies and afterward to the park to spend some time together.  Under the cover of darkness, they had started making out.  As Tomas had gotten turned on, she had felt it. The massive organ that was more fit for a barnyard than a back seat.  She had screamed and made him drive her home.  They broke up that night.  For a while he was inconsolable but he eventually found his way past the hurt of rejection.  <br />
<br />
That hurt stung even more when the girl had appeared on the doorstep in the night with a child in her arms.  Without word she had passed the spitting image of Tomas into Maria&#39;s arms. Her family moved that night and they had never been seen again.  <br />
<br />
18 years later Javier and Maria had retired in the suburbs, Tomas was  working some job in the city providing for him and his son, and Bo had started his business and Andy was in the booth of that business on his tablet, the only one aware that time and date had been changed by a few taps and gestures.  <br />
<br />
As Andy pressed enter Bo sprung back into action.</p>
