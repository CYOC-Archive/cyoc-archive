<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Filling the cup proved to be a bit difficult, but Doctor Kathy Tucker was pleased that Jade managed to fill a good portion of the cup and didn&#39;t break any teeth in doing so. It took some twisting of her head to get the venom to flow from the venom glands in her lower jaw, down her teeth and into the cup and let it collect in the bottom, but it ultimately was successful. That was of a good relief to Kathy, as she really didn&#39;t have much in the way of knowledge on the production of anti-venom, or antivenin, venom antiserum and antivenom immunoglobulin. She knew that in general it was produced from the anti-bodies produced by an animal, but she also knew that the production was difficult for certain species. Particularly in the fact that those produced for the Komodo Dragon were extremely rare and more often not might rely on antivenin that was designed for snakes with a similar venom  to that which the Indonesian lizard produced, partially because for years it was assumed that the fatal agent was actually the bacteria in the Komodo Dragon&#39;s mouth, not a poison produced by the lizard. At present the only sites for anti-venom were with zoos that had the lizard as part of their collection and they were often pretty protective of it because of the toxicity of the Komodo Dragon&#39;s bite and because the rarity of someone being bitten by one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kathy spoke to Jade with some private sense of relief at Jade was able to provide a sample.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way, thank you for giving me the chance to provide some help,&quot; Jade said weakly with a weak smile on her muzzle and then gave a sigh, which Kathy couldn&#39;t be sure was the result of Kathy&#39;s mission to try and produce Anti-Venom for the bite that Dymixious had given a Moon Lake police officer or from her present labor, &quot;This whole thing with my husband is complex... I insist that he was a good man and wanted nothing more than to protect our secret from those that would likely wish to do us harm...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade handed the filled cup to Kathy, who was careful to take it with both hands. The pregnant werehorse looked on to Jade as she looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... I do know that there are things that angered my husband... I&#39;ve tried to urge him to be more calm on things, but I suppose I failed with that,&quot; Jade said with a sigh, &quot;and that&#39;s what brought about what happened earlier... And harm was never something that Dymixious would have truly wished on fellow weres. At least this way... I may be able to provide some help and aid... We&#39;ve already been enough trouble. Hopefully this helps the officer... And if you can... tell him I&#39;m sorry for the inconvenience my husband has caused him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy nodded to Jade and then to Frances and made her way out. The donation was important, as it would provide some help for the bitten officer. She knew that officially produced anti-venom was on the way, in theory for research into the production of a better version of it, which would mean that the bitten officer was likely to survive the bite he had sustained, but the present situation had her rushing to try and produce a version on her own in the hopes getting some quicker than what would be likely in the issue of getting through the bureaucratic tape that related what was being delivered from Seattle.<br />
<br />
With that, she was quick to return to the hospital&#39;s laboratory where she found her main assistant, a werecheetah, obviously in her human form, already at work. She looked to Kathy as Kathy entered and gave a small but nervous smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Doctor Tucker... I trust you were successful?&quot; she asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Jade Drake was able to provide for us a venom sample,&quot; Kathy said with a sigh, &quot;what can you tell me on the situation with the bitten officer. How is he responding to the venom in question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got a couple of blood samples,&quot; the lab assistant said slowly, &quot;we can see some signs of his body producing some anti-bodies, typical for a lycanthropic reaction to poisons... but even with what was the likely small amount that was put into the officer&#39;s system... the natural production won&#39;t be enough to assure survival...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;ll need anti-venom,&quot; Kathy finished with a heavy sigh and gave a nod, &quot;with that, we can be sure that he&#39;ll get it. The Seattle Zoo has agreed to provide us with a sample that they keep on hand for &quot;just in case scenarios&quot; regarding their staff and the dragon in their collection... as per a request to perfect the anti-venom... but we have been tasked to produce some on our own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her lab assistant nodded and then commented, &quot;Well... that shouldn&#39;t be too hard... we have the equipment to spread the venom out into vials... and in that we can mix it with water to lower the potency of the venom. We may need to repeat that process a few times if we&#39;re to do this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll still need a volunteer with type O blood and because our sample is from a were, that volunteer will also need to be a were,&quot; Kathy spoke, &quot;and then hope that we don&#39;t overdose the volunteer...&quot;<br />
<br />
The lab assistant nodded, &quot;Which would you like me to handle first, doctor. Getting our equipment prepped or finding a volunteer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll deal with the equipment,&quot; Kathy spoke with a sigh, &quot;from what I know... is that we&#39;ll have to repeat this process several times in order to dilute the strength enough that when we test it we won&#39;t put our volunteer into the ER. Just make sure that we find a member of the safe that is a were with type O blood who is willing to serve as a guinea pig...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy watched as her assistant nodded and headed out quickly, leaving Kathy alone and looking at the plastic container holding the venom sample and sighed heavily. What they would have to do weighed against every moral code she had as a physician and in theory would risk the life of the volunteer, as she wasn&#39;t one hundred percent sure on how much the venom should be diluted before given to the volunteer. If it was too much, it might still trigger the antibody response, but in also destroying tissue at a rate that even a were&#39;s ability to heal wouldn&#39;t keep up, as was being noticed to some degree with the bitten officer. If it was too little, it wouldn&#39;t trigger enough antibodies to be able to help the bitten officer. But at the same time, she didn&#39;t have much choice, and at least they&#39;d have a fall back option in case their efforts failed...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Ryan Conner continued to provide some updates on how things went at the hospital, including updating Police Chief O&#39;Hara that Dymixious did not survive the surgery, that the damage he&#39;d taken in the battle had been too much to repair and heal from, even for a were.  For the moment, he was tasked to keep security on the area, as the FBI&#39;s &quot;team&quot; had arrived in Moon Lake and might well wish to see the body before they leave to confirm that Dymixious was in fact dead. And there, the fact that Dymixious had transformed during the battle was enough present certain troubles. Contrary to what many movies would make of it, if a were died in their were form, they did not automatically resume human form. Moon Lake had found the specific hormones that weres produced that related to transforming between their were and human forms, and had managed to synthesize them over the years for such instances, but they&#39;d also found that with a dead were, it would still take time for that introduced artificial hormone could turn the body BACK to its human form. In this, Ryan Conner was instructed to make sure that if they arrived before Dymixious&#39;s body resumed human form that they didn&#39;t get access to the body.<br />
<br />
The other thing was keep some security while the wounded officers were being treated. Samson Carter proved easily treated and had already gone home, as the results on him was that while he was injured, it wasn&#39;t anything that lycanthropic regeneration couldn&#39;t handle and he&#39;d just need time to recover. Ryan Conner also updated Chief O&#39;Hara on what the hospital suggested with regard to Samson Carter&#39;s duty schedule for the coming week as well. The last one that he&#39;d been assigned to check in on was Officer Frank. He was a weredog, who&#39;s were form was based off the German Shepard, and was presently in the hospital&#39;s ICU where he was recovering from the bite Dymixious delivered during the battle.<br />
<br />
&quot;How have they been treating you?&quot; Ryan asked to Officer Frank as he lay in the medical bed that he&#39;d been put in.<br />
<br />
&quot;About as well as can be managed,&quot; Officer Frank answered somewhat weakly and held up an arm. The wound had been cleaned and wrapped in a bandage, but the tubes that came to Officer Frank&#39;s arms that were connected to IV tubes did clearly represent the medicines being used to treat the symptoms from Dymixious&#39;s venom. &quot;They come down for blood samples every hour or so... and refill the IV bags as needed... I can&#39;t even tell you what the medicine is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t hurt too bad, does it?&quot; Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not with what they put in the IV bags,&quot; Officer Frank managed to chuckle and then coughed before settling back into the bed, &quot;The medicine seems to be helping... and the wound didn&#39;t leave that much venom to make it in...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good, I suppose,&quot; Ryan commented.<br />
<br />
Officer Frank nodded, &quot;they say I&#39;ll still need anti-venom, but that is on its way and I&#39;m managing to fight this off well enough that I should live long enough to get it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan Conner gave a sigh at that. The fact that Officer Frank would survive was a great relief, given that much of what Moon Lake had on venomous weres was purely theoretical as there were no venomous weres presently living in Moon Lake. It would limit the death that had occurred to just Dymixious, though a part of Ryan Conner even felt that his death was one death too many. He eventually leaned forward from the chair he&#39;d moved up beside Officer Frank&#39;s bed and patted the wounded officer&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good,&quot; Ryan Conner spoke, &quot;Chief O&#39;Hara will be glad to hear that. Did they tell you when they&#39;d have anti-venom ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ready now, officer,&quot; came a woman&#39;s voice making Ryan Conner look up.<br />
<br />
He looked up to see Kathy Tucker and Tora Tachibana enter ICU room. Each held a set of syringes and moved to one of the IV bags. Kathy approached it first and lifted up the tubing so that Ryan Conner noticed a small plastic knob where the female doctor inserted the needle she held.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were very fortunate, Officer Frank,&quot; Kathy spoke, &quot;given the description of the wound, I would have figured that you&#39;d gotten much more venom than you actually did. And as such, you don&#39;t need as much anti-venom as one might expect from the sort of wound you received.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, that means I can go home?&quot; Officer Frank asked as Kathy depressed the plunger.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll want you to stay the night,&quot; Tora spoke, &quot;just to make sure you don&#39;t have a negative response to the anti-venom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you can be rest assured, that the anti-venom we have will more than do the job,&quot; Kathy spoke, &quot;tests found it to be good and will handle the affects of the venom and letting lycanthropic regeneration ultimately handle the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt quite lucky that things had ultimately worked out, as her produced sample was about the same taking blood plasma that was laced with the anti-venom antibody, but she had managed to get it going and a brief test on the blood sample that had been taken from Officer Frank had shown that the anti-venom would work and had no negative effect on the normal red blood cells. It was something that Kathy felt fortunate on and something that she hoped would never happen again. Ryan Conner felt a great deal of relief as it would mean that for the Moon Lake PD, the worst of the consequences that relate to the arrest of Dymixious Drake was the death of Dymixious.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you may also know that Jade Drake is sorry for her husband&#39;s actions and wishes things could have been handled better,&quot; Kathy told Officer Frank, who only nodded, feeling relieved at being given the time and ability to heal.</p>
