<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>"All this transforming has worked up an appetite," Samantha said, patting her flat stomach. "Let's get a snack."
<P>"Like what?" Tricia asked. "Fast food? Pizza?"
<P>"I'm in the mood for ice cream, actually."
<P>"Sounds good to me," Trish agreed. She opened the restroom door. "Would you care to lead this time?"
<P>Sam gladly took point and led Trish through the bookstore. On their way past the main desk, Mrs. Finn said "Goodbye, Samantha! Have a nice day."
<P>Sam was a little surprised to be recognized, but she gave Mrs. Finn a polite goodbye and continued out the door.
<P>The sun was just beginning to set outside. "I wonder," Sam thought out loud to Trish as they descended the library steps, "Did the remote change reality so that Mrs. Finn recognized me as a lifetime patron, or did it change reality so that I had a conversation with her before entering the bathroom as an eighteen-year-old skunk, instead of a six-year-old human?"
<P>"No idea," Trish shrugged. "It works in mysterious ways."
<P>"Har har," Sam grumbled.
<P>At the ice cream parlor, Sam ordered a large brownie sundae, while Tricia was content with a small vanilla shake. "There's no way you're going to be able to eat all that," Trish predicted.
<P>"Just watch me," Sam said defiantly. "I'll probably even order seconds. I'm ravenous tonight." As the skunk-girls waited for their orders, Tricia idly thumbed through the remote's menus. One in particular caught her eye based on what Sam just said. The remote apparently had the ability to alter someone's weight, and other various aspects of their body. She grinned as a new plot hatched in her mind.
<P>Once the girls were seated at a table with their frozen treats, Trish pretended to send a text message on her cell phone. She was actually looking a little to the left of her phone, however, at the remote in her lap. She noticed that her scan of Samantha's body earlier in the day showed that she had a rather efficient metabolism. Trish decided she'd slow that down considerably, and then some. Not only would Sam take much longer to process food, but the remote could make it so that every bite she took would trigger an instant increase in weight. In short, for every brownie sundae that Sam were to consume, her body would suddenly gain weight as if she had already digested four or five of them.
<P>Trish finalized the settings and zapped Sam under the table just seconds before she put the first spoonful of ice cream into her mouth.
<P>"Mmm!" Sam said, then swallowed. "That's exactly what I needed right now."
<P>Tricia slowly slurped her milkshake, eying Sam carefully. After several bites, she thought she started to notice something, but she wasn't sure.
<P>"Eating this is weird," Sam spoke. "This new muzzle is longer than a regular mouth. I have to work harder to keep my lips closed as I chew. How are you coming with your milkshake?"
<P>"Sucking through a straw is definitely not the same as chewing," Trish responded as Sam took another generous bite.
<P>"I guess. The weirdest thing is this tail, though. Just being able to feel what it feels and control its movements is a big distraction."
<P>"I know the feeling," Trish said. She was probably adapting to it better than Sam was, after all she had spent the entire morning with a cow tail. "I'm not sure which tail I like better, the cow or the skunk," Trish mused aloud. "The cow tail was neat, but simple. This tail is amazingly fluffy and adorable, but it's unruly."
<P>"Ugh, I know. Just sitting with my back against this booth, I have to make sure I don't sit <i>too</i> far back, or it gets uncomfortable. They're going to have to make proper chairs for us."
<P>Trish could see it now, quite plainly. Sam's shirt was beginning to grow tighter on her chest. Her stomach had lost its inner curve, and in a few more bites it would begin to grow out.
<P>"So what do you have planned after this?" Sam asked, snapping Trish out of her stare.
<P>"I figured we'd call it a day and head home."
<P>"I mean, what's my next transformation. I'm sure you've already thought of something else."
<P>"Ah, right," Trish's mouth betrayed a sly grin. "I'm working on it as we eat...er...speak."
<P>"Heh. I take it that's a good milkshake?"
<P>Luckily, Samantha had caught onto Trish's Freudian slip, but had misinterpreted it. "Yeah, one of the best I've ever had." She continued slurping, her eyes slowly falling upon Sam's stomach once again.
<P>After another couple minutes had passed, Sam was finishing up the sundae, and the change to her body was becoming evident. Her shirt was hugging her body like never before. Her belly, no longer able to contain the fat and food that had developed, was ever so slowly expanding outward. Her shapely hourglass figure was taking a serious blow thanks to the fat that had taken up residence in her sides, and now her pants were starting to appear strained. That wasn't the only area to have changed, however. Her lean arms were beginning to soften as well.
<P>"That's one down, one to go!" Sam triumphantly exclaimed. "I told you I could finish it. I'm not even full yet, though I probably will be when I'm done with number two." She stood up to throw out the empty dish and order a new sundae, and Trish could see that her thighs had also gained a hint of fat.
<P>Tricia began to worry that Sam would start to notice her changes, however. It was getting to be significant...heck, it already was significant. By all means, Sam was still normal-looking, attractive as ever, but to someone who knew her, she was clearly starting to gain weight. And who knew Samantha better than Samantha?
<P>She fiddled with the remote, and tapped the button that would set Samantha's awareness to oblivious-mode, making her think she had been getting fatter for a while instead of all of a sudden, all at once, in this one ice cream parlor. She'd probably pitch a fit if she found out Trish had done this to her, and she'd probably have no qualms about doing it in public this time.
<P>Samantha was trotting back with her new sundae. Her large tail and white hair swished as she walked. She still looked beautiful, even if she had gained a few pounds. What harm could a few more do?
<P>With little time to spare, Trish discretely positioned the remote and...</p>
