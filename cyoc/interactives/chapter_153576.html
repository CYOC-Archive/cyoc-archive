<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dean excitedly walked through the front door of his house, excited to tell his dad about their final victory. All his life, Dean&#39;s dad Frank had been overbearing and at odds with him. Frank was a jock through and through. He played sports all his life and continued to hit the gym and find community leagues to play in in his adult life. Now even in his late 40s he had a body most men would kill for. Frank stood an even 6&#39; tall. He was naturally gifted with wide shoulders, further emphasized by the round delts that capped them. His meaty pecs sat atop a stomach that wasn&#39;t quite as tight as it once was, especially now that Frank was stuck working an office job, but his regular exercise kept him from going completely soft. Years of playing football and other sports gave Frank a strong pair of legs as well.<br />
<br />
While Dean&#39;s dad was loud and boisterous, His mom Judy was more quiet and reserved. She was also more slight in stature. Never really one for sports herself, her naturally petit frame had begun to pad itself out in recent years, much to her dismay. It was clear that pre-contagion Dean had gotten much of his build and body type from his mom.<br />
<br />
When he first heard he was having a boy, Frank was ecstatic. He dreamed of having a boy to share his love of sports with. But as Dean grew up, his dreams were dashed as Dean remained thin and frail, and more interested in sedentary hobbies like books and video games. As a result, He and Dean often found themselves at odds with each other, arguing over the direction of Dean&#39;s life and his goals. Judy tended to stay out of the matter for fear of stirring the pot.<br />
<br />
But ever since Dean had hit is recent &quot;growth spurt&quot; and developed a love for football and working out, he and his dad found themselves growing closer than ever. Strange as the sudden change was, neither of them thought into it too much, grateful to have a better relationship. Dean and Frank began going to the gym together and hanging out together watching sports more often.<br />
<br />
All this close contact allowed the contagion to find Frank as its next host.<br />
<br />
Even though he only worked out to maintain rather than put on size, Frank found his lifts were increasing. He wasn&#39;t trying to go heavier, but he didn&#39;t feel like he was getting a workout otehrwise.<br />
<br />
Two weeks later, Frank was sitting at his office desk and he absentmindedly pulled at the unusually tight collar of his button up shirt. The past few days, all of his clothes were feeling unusually tight. Feeling particularly uncomfortable, Frank leaned back and stretched his arms out to his side but suddenly he heard a pop. Then another, and finally one more. A stray button settled on his desk in front of him. Frank looked down and realized he had actually popped the buttons of his shirt, revealing the cleavage of his pecs. He looked around for the other two buttons and located one on the floor. When he stooped down to pick it up, he heard a rip come from behind him. He twisted around and saw the fabric of his boxers showing through the seat of his ripped pants, no longer able to contain his glutes. He sat back up and tried to pull his shirt closed when he heard another rip come from behind him. He didn&#39;t need to look to know his shirt had ripped down the back.<br />
<br />
Frank ran to his car and headed home as quick as he could to get a change of clothes. Once he got home he grabbed new clothes and headed into the bathroom when he caught himself in the mirror. He looked... good. Real good. He had no idea what was going on because he hadn&#39;t changed his diet or workout plan, but he looked like he&#39;d been seriously bodybuilding for at least a few months. His shoulders had grown wider and his arms had gained at least an inch or two. He felt a larger pec but his eyes bugged out when he saw his abs. He had abs! He hadn&#39;t seen his abs in several years, but there they were. He ran his fingers over each groove. In fact his whole body looked like it had tightened up. New striations and veins visible where they hadn&#39;t been before.<br />
<br />
Frank tried putting on a new shirt and after some struggle, finally managed to get it on, but his success was short lived. As soon as he inhaled, the top two buttons popped off this shirt too. Defeated, turned on, and confused, Frank ended up calling in sick to work and went clothes shopping.<br />
<br />
Another month later, Frank and Dean were working out at the gym. Dean was spotting his dad on the bench who was lifting with an intense ferocity unlike anything Dean had seen from him before. Beofre the last month anyways. After he realized he was inexplicably putting on muscle, Frank decided to go all in and threw himself into the gym, working out harder than ever before, and with some help from the contagion he was making unbelievable progress.<br />
<br />
Despite his age and being well past puberty, Frank had grown 2 inches to 6&#39;2&quot;. But his body was bigger than it had even been before, no matter how much he&#39;d ever worked out. Frank tipped the scales at 264 lbs and not an ounce of it was fat. He was bigger, more defined, more vascular than he had even been in his 20s and 30s. He looked like a competition ready heavyweight bodybuilder, and he&#39;d even been eating dirty in an effort to put on size. Everything he ate got turned into muscle.<br />
<br />
Shortly after he grew out of all of his office clothes, Frank decided to quit his day job to focus on bodybuilding. The night he announced that to the family, Dean was dumbstruck on two accounts. First because he never imagined his dad doing something like that, especially at his age, but second because it was onle of the only times he&#39;d ever seen his mom raise her voice.<br />
<br />
But frank wasn&#39;t deterred, and in fact had arranged for both he and Dean to participate in a competition in another month, which they were both now getting ready for.<br />
<br />
Dean&#39;s growth had slown since his contagion-induced growth spurt, but he still put on a little size. He liked his athletic physique and was hesitant to put on too much size, but had done so to appease his dad. &quot;Some things never change&quot; he sighed and thought to himself between sets.<br />
<br />
After another month, Frank was heading home after the competition. He took the whole competition by surprise and won first place. A complete newcomer at the age of 46 had won first place in his very first competition. Dean had also won first place in the junior division, but at his height and size, he was given a hard time by many of the officials under the suspicion that he wasn&#39;t really 14.<br />
<br />
Over the last month, Frank and the contagion had pushed his body up to 302 lbs of pure muscle. He was ecstatic when he weighed in on the day of the competition at over 300 lbs. When he&#39;d weighed himself the night before he was at 298 and was disappointed he hadn&#39;t passed 300. Frank blamed his scale for being improperly calibrated. the truth was the contagion had added the extra 4 pounds just overnight.<br />
<br />
In the course of the month, Frank noticed other changes, not just to his body. When he looked at his face in the mirror, he noticed he was looking... better. More youthful. The fine lines around his eyes and mouth had faded. The gray hairs he hated had darkened and returned to his natural color. Even his skin looked smoother and more elastic.<br />
<br />
Dean and Frank Headed back home to celebrate their victories, but who had they infected with the contagion over the past few months?</p>
