<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Blake finished writing his notes. Then he asked, &quot;Are you healthy?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;I think so.&quot; I&#39;d been shrunk but I didn&#39;t feel any different.<br />
<br />
Blake asked, &quot;Do you want to grow back now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought quickly. I was making more progress with Blake if I stayed small then I would normally be making. At normal size, he&#39;d go right back to his inventions and ignore me again. I said, &quot;No, you need to make sure I&#39;m healthy. You need to make sure your shrink ray doesn&#39;t have any side effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake smiled and I knew I was getting through to him. He grabbed some books and some equipment and brought them to the desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never examined anyone so I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s done.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;I know you monitor your own health. I&#39;m sure you can figure it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was awkward but he did know what he was doing. He first asked me to check my own pulse because he couldn&#39;t figure out how to check that. He got out a thermometer to check my temperature and I could barely fit it in my mouth. He had to support it&#39;s weight and we weren&#39;t sure how accurate it was but I didn&#39;t feel hot or cold.<br />
<br />
&quot;We might have to get some special equipment. I don&#39;t have a blood pressure cuff that small.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
He did have a small light that he used to look in my ear and up my nose. I giggled at the absurdity. I told him how easily I could see up his nose and he blushed and covered his nose. Then he laughed and stopped covering his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;I apologize if you see anything gross. Do I need to clean?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;No, your fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he started to lift my shirt and I grabbed it and said, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t be grabby.&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;Sorry. Would you take off your shirt so I can check you over.&quot;<br />
<br />
I realized I blew it with my reaction. I took off my shirt.<br />
<br />
Blake did have a stethoscope which he used to listen to my heart. The stethoscope covered my entire chest.<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;You&#39;re healthy as far as I can tell. I need better equipment.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought quickly and said, &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to check my skin for discoloration?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;Oh, I hadn&#39;t thought about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stood there for a moment trying to think of a way to get him to finish undressing me. I went ahead and took off my shoes and socks. Then I unfastened my pants and froze.<br />
<br />
Blake asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
I asked, &quot;Have you ever seen me naked before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;I don&#39;t remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
I understood that answer. Although I think Blake and I had seen each other naked in the locker room, it wasn&#39;t a common occurrence and I couldn&#39;t remember anything about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel shy.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re both male. What&#39;s to be shy about?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
I let my pants fall and stepped out of them. He looked me over and then asked me to raise my arms. Then he asked me to spread my legs so he could see the skin there.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I?&quot; he asked as he took my hand. My entire hand disappeared between his thumb and finger. Then he gently lifted my arm so he could get a close look at my hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing. So tiny and yet so detailed.&quot; Blake continued to touch me as he examined me from head to foot. He gently picked me up which scared me because even being gentle, the muscles of his fingers were bigger than the muscles in my arms.<br />
<br />
Then he turned me around and examined my back. I felt his finger giving me a good massage. Then he pulled my shorts down and I kept my mouth shut. He touched my ass a few times and then spread my ass cheeks and looked at my hole. My cock was now straining at full inflation thinking. He was looking at my hole.<br />
<br />
Then he turned me back around again. I don&#39;t know if he felt my erection against his hand or not but when he saw it, he blushed and nearly dropped me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, sorry. I&#39;m being too grabby again.&quot; He put me down on the desk.<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;It&#39;s alright. You need to examine me thoroughly. For science. I&#39;m just going to have to reconcile myself to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake gave me another smile. Slowly he picked me up again and started examining me. He took my stiffy in his hand and then he felt my balls, pushing them around a bit. I groaned and bit my lip but said nothing.<br />
<br />
Then he put me down again and he got his microscope out. He started examining me again from head to toe under the microscope. My stiffy faded and I felt anticlimactic. But I got to see through a microscope from the other side. It was funny that he had to use the microscope to see me instead of looking at me when I wasn&#39;t shrunk.<br />
<br />
Blake grabbed some sort of prodding tool and a pair of tweezers. He used them to prod me around. Both tools had soft plastic tips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was very thorough examining every inch (or sixth of an inch) of my entire body. He even used the tweezers to pick up my cock and balls being careful not to squeeze too hard. I was sweating buckets.<br />
<br />
He flipped me over again and used the tweezers to pry my asshole open. My cock was pressed against the hot glass of the slide. Then he put the prod inside me and poked around. I shot my load.<br />
<br />
I screamed and went limp. Blake asked, &quot;Are you okay?&quot; and quickly removed me from the microscope laying me on my back on the desk.<br />
<br />
I rolled back over onto my stomach and said, &quot;I left you a semen sample to study.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake quickly went back to the microscope to look at my little swimmers. He said, &quot;Even your semen is tiny.&quot;<br />
<br />
I just lay there spreading my legs and trying to be completely limp. Blake came back to look at me. &quot;Seriously, are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m good.&quot; I said. &quot;I&#39;m here for you Blake. You want to stick another probe up my ass, I&#39;m here for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I guess I got carried away. I raped my only friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
I took on a commanding tone, &quot;Blake, pick me up.&quot; He picked me up. I said, &quot;Now look at me.&quot; I made a point not to hide anything from him as he looked at me. &quot;I am your friend. I&#39;m not your only friend but I am truly your friend. I did not expect the first thing up my ass to be a pair of tweezers so you did surprise me. But were you finished looking inside my ass?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake said, &quot;Well, no.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Then get to it. Put me back under the microscope and finish your examination.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blake smiled at me and put me back under the microscope. I braced myself for the invasion. He put the tweezers back inside me and poked around a while. Instead of pressing myself against the slide to get away from the invasion, I started to rise up into it. When I was on all fours, he used the prod to move my cock and balls around.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he grabbed me from the microscope and put me down on the floor again with the pair of tweezers next to me. I looked back to see what he was doing and he got the shrink ray, fiddled with it and fired at me. I grew back to normal size but the tweezers were now six times larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to compare with the normal size.&quot; He grabbed the tweezers and invaded me again. He said, &quot;For science.&quot; But I knew this had nothing to do with science anymore. I dropped my head to the floor but left my ass in the air for him. With my ass wide open, he played with my cock till I shot another load. Then he excused himself.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, he came back with a more scientific demeanor again, &quot;You&#39;re all sweaty.&quot; I could tell he was sweaty too. &quot;Go take a shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
I rose up and slowly took a shower. I was exhausted but very relaxed.<br />
<br />
After the shower, I went back into his room and he again had his nose buried in a notebook. I reminded him that my clothes were still shrunk on the desk and he restored them for me. I got dressed in silence and wondered if he was ignoring me again. I sat there for a bit. Then I got up to leave.<br />
<br />
Just before I left, he said, &quot;We will probably need to do some more experiments. I hope your willing to volunteer again.&quot; Then he turned back to his notebook.<br />
<br />
I smiled as I left.</p>
