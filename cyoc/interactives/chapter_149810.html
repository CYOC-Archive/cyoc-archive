<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a dream come true for Ann. The goth teen had transformed her step sister Gloria into the infant of twin of their sister Lynne, altering Ann’s life and reality as well. In this new reality it was Ann that had defeated Morgan LeFay, it was Ann that had repaired the relationship between Lisa and her parents. Everything that Gloria had done to make things better for everyone was now due to Ann. As a result the dreary teen found herself going from living in the shadow of everyone to out in front and admired by all.<br />
<br />
Ann at first wasn’t sure how everyone would act around her but quickly discovered very little had changed. Ann’s friends remained unchanged and although Ann was never particularly close with Gloria’s old friends she found that the girls were cordial, even friendly toward her now. Ann had gone from a social outcast to quite popular and all it took was turning Gloria into Ann infant. Still, there were drawbacks.<br />
<br />
As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. Katie was now ever present in her life, always making sure she was okay and having her practice her magic. It annoyed Ann a little but she did enjoy bonding with her sister over magic. Lynne and Gloria though were a different story. Oddly although no one remembered the old Gloria it seemed that Lynne did. The tiny auburn haired infant often glared at Ann whenever she was near. While Lynne had not used her magic against Ann, she could tell that the child did not like her. It didn’t help that the now infant Gloria always looked fearfully at Ann anytime she approached. Ann had been sure that the spell she cast would wipe Gloria’s mind clean. That however did not seem to be the case. Gloria would wimpier whenever Ann approached and although Lisa tried to reassure her that the babies would eventually come to love Ann, she had her doubts.<br />
<br />
Lisa and Jason now decided to take a day trip in order to get some much needed rest. Ann, naturally, was asked to watch the girls. Lisa trusted the girl unconditionally and since reality had been altered saw nothing but good things from the young teen. As Ann looked looked down at her sleeping sisters she hoped she would be able to talk with the two infants, explain her actions, and hopefully make the two understand just how happy she was now. The sound of the doorbell though drew Ann’s attention. Curiously she now approached the door wondering who it could be,<br />
<br />
Jack, Ayami, Sebastian, and Rexie now gazed out at the neighborhood, shocked at how similar yet different things were from their own timeline. “I don’t think I will ever get used to hopping between timelines,” Rexie said quietly. “I mean aside from a few of the houses it looks exactly the same.”<br />
<br />
“From what I’ve heard this is what Katie’s timeline looks like,” Jack stated. “The only difference between this world and that is Ann.”<br />
<br />
Almost as if on que, Ann now opened the door smiling happily at her teenage father. “Daddy,” she exclaimed as she hugged him tightly. “So great to see you.” Jack smirked as he now returned his daughters embrace. “Hey Annie how have you been.”<br />
<br />
“Great,” she said happily. “Things have been going great lately. Come on in. Lisa and Jason went away for the day so I’m just watching the babies.”<br />
<br />
“Your watching Morgan,” Rexie said, raising an eyebrow. Ann giggled, shaking her head. “No silly Gloria and Lynne.”<br />
<br />
Jack paused, taking a firm hold of Ann’s arm as he gazed curiously at his daughter. “What do you mean Gloria,” he asked. “Gloria’s your age Ann.”<br />
<br />
“No don’t be silly daddy,” Ann said nervously. “Gloria is Lynne’s twin. She’s always been Lynne’s twin,”<br />
<br />
Jack raised an eyebrow as he gazed curiously at Ann. That wasn’t right, he knew that the only difference in this timeline was Ann being his teenage daughter and not the middle sister of Kellie. “Show me where she is.”<br />
<br />
Ann gulped, nodding quickly as she turned towards where the infants slept. How could her father possibly remember that Gloria was supposed to be a teen? Ann was in possession of two Rings of Age. Ann had altered reality to such an extent that not even Merlin batted an eye. Everyone believed that the reality she had created was how things were supposed to be. That her own father seemed to have knowledge of the timeline before she changed now made her break into a cold sweat. “See there she is daddy,” she said nervously.<br />
<br />
Jacks eyes went wide as he gazed down at the two infants. Gloria stared up at him fearfully, while Lynne gave him a sour look. Being this close to the two infants Jack could sense the incredible amount of magic that had been used to turn Gloria into this child. Shocked, yet impressed, Jack could only give a short laugh before turning towards his daughter. Before she could say anything Ayami approached from behind. “I thought you said the only difference in this timeline was Ann,” she said curiously. “Why is Gloria a baby?”<br />
<br />
“It appears Ann here altered reality,” Jack said with a smile. “She seems to have transformed Gloria into this.”<br />
<br />
Ayami and the others gasped as they leaned towards the two infants. “No I didn’t,” Ann said quickly. Jack turned towards his daughter a small frown upon his face. “Cmon Ann,” he sighed. “I can sense the magic and I see the second ring on your hand. Care to explain yourself?”<br />
<br />
Ann could feel the color drain from her face as she now tried to form words to explain her actions. “I...I..” Ann could only stammer a response. Finally the girl lowered her head, her shoulders slumping as she gazed at the floor in defeat. “I’m sorry daddy,” she groaned. “I was...just so tried of living in her shadow. It’s always about her. I changed her a few days ago. And it’s been the best few days of my life. I have everything I always wanted, but it was wrong. I’m, I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
Jack could see the young teens eyes begin to water as she stared at the floor. If Kellie had been here she would of comforted the girl before trying to convince her to change Gloria back, Jack though was not Kellie. He was impressed. Ann had altered reality to suit her selfish needs, a move that pushed the young teen towards a path of darkness. Jack being the heir apparent to Morgan LeFay was more than happy to see his daughter following in her footsteps.<br />
<br />
“Hey Ann,” he said softly. “Look, it’s okay. Yes it’s a shock but I understand.”<br />
<br />
“You do,” Ann asked, shocked by the answer. Jack nodded as he placed his hand on Ann’s shoulders. “Yes I do,” he said. “Ann we have a great gift and while we do use that gift to help others I don’t see the problem with helping ourselves once in awhile.”<br />
<br />
“I thought you would be mad,” Ann whispered. “I mean I can’t believe you actually noticed. No one has.”<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t surprise me,” Jack shrugged. “You performed some very powerful magic.”<br />
<br />
“Do you think mom will be mad?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll worry about your mother,” Jack said. “Just, don’t tell her okay?” Ann nodded, causing Jack to smile. <br />
<br />
“This is perfect,” Ayami smirked. “Gloria is one of the most powerful wizards in the other timeline. Now reduced to infancy we can take her for our own.” Ann’s eyes went wide in horror as the succubus slowly approached the bassinet where the two infants lay. “Wait don’t hurt them,” she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think you need to worry,” Jack said softly as he watched to two infants. “I’m pretty sure Ayami is about to discover your sisters are far from helpless.”<br />
<br />
Ayami grinned, her fangs bared as she gazed at the two young infants. Gloria’s small eyes went wide with fear as the succubus approached, Lynne However seems to glare angrily at the demon. “Eliminate Gloria and Lynne in one fell swoop,” Ayami thought. “Destroying these two will make the darkness stronger than ever.”  <br />
<br />
Ayami was unaware of the spell the young Lynne now used to defend herself and her twin. As the demons clawed hand approached the infants watched as it began to grow smaller. Ayami paused as she looked herself over, surprised to see her usually tight clothing slowly begging to grow baggy on her frame.<br />
<br />
“Hey what’s going on,” Ayami asked, unaware of the higher octave of her voice.<br />
<br />
Jack smirked as the succubus now began to shrink. Already she was at least a half a foot shorter and still shrinking. The stunned demon turned towards her allies in shock, watching as they seemed to grow larger before her. Ayami gazed down at her body, shocked to see she was rapidly growing smaller. “What’s the deal,” Ayami squeaked as she shrank down to 4 feet tall.<br />
<br />
“Ayami,” Jack sighed. “Did youbreally think it would be so easy to take out both Lynne and Gloria.”<br />
<br />
Ayami frowned as she clutched her rapidly growing clothes around her shrinking form. “I didn’t know they had this much magic,” she whined as her top slipped off her rapidly shrinking shoulders. “Then you didn’t do your homework,” Jack countered.<br />
<br />
Ayami growled as she continued to shrink. The succubus continued to dwindle as she shrank down to 3 feet, then 2. Finally the succubus finished shrinking, leaving her at only 18 inches tall. The tiny demon strained her neck upwards as she clutched her clothing to her small frame. “Is this permanent,” she yelled, her voice barely loud enough to hear.<br />
<br />
“Doubtful,” Jack answered as he now picked up the succubus, wrapping her in her discarded clothes. The demon frowned as she sat in the palm of Jacks hand. Despite the succubus usual penchant for showing of her body, she felt embarrassed to be reduced to doll size and now clutched her clothes tightly to her body.<br />
<br />
“Well Ann,” Jack said. “It was great to see you again. Make sure you take care of your sisters. We always protect those closest to us, remember that.” Ann nodded as he Jack now turned to leave. “Oh and one more thing,” he said with a smirk. “Don’t tell your mom I came to visit Okay?” Ann could only nod as her father now exited her home. Turning towards her infant sisters Ann could see the girls fearfully looking up at her. Ann would protect them, she just wasn’t sure if she should reverse what she had done.</p>
