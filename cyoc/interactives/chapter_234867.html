<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marissa, still puzzled by the mysterious device, bounded up the stairs to her room. As she reached the top step, she felt a strange warmth spreading from her stomach. She looked down and gasped in shock. Her once flat belly was now noticeably rounded, pushing against the fabric of her pajama top. The material stretched taut, threatening to tear under the sudden pressure. W-What&#39;s happening? Marissa stammered, her heart pounding in her chest. She looked down at her legs, only to find them thickening, muscles growing and toning in a matter of seconds. Her feet, once small and dainty, were now larger, her toes spreading wider to accommodate the change. Her pajama bottoms were no match for the sudden growth spurt. The seams groaned in protest, ripping apart like tissue paper under the stress. Marissa watched in horror as her thighs rubbed together, the friction causing her pants to shred further until they hung off her hips in tattered remnants. She quickly undid her top button, only for it to pop off and fly across the room as her breasts swelled, straining against the fabric. The once loose-fitting pajamas were now a tight, revealing outfit, barely containing her rapidly changing body. Marissa&#39;s hair, once a simple mess of dark waves, now cascaded down her back in thick, glossy curls. Her eyes widened as she felt her face change shape, her jawline softening, and her cheeks plumping up. She rushed to the mirror, only to find a stranger staring back at her. Her once sharp features were now round and soft, her eyes larger and doe-like. She turned around, trying to see the extent of the changes in her body. Her back was now a symphony of curves, her ass full and round, straining against the remnants of her pajama bottoms. She looked like she had gained at least fifty pounds in a matter of minutes, and yet, she felt no discomfort, no strain. Instead, she felt... alive. Marissa took a deep breath, trying to process the sudden transformation. She picked up the device from the box she had left on her bed, turning it over in her hands. She pressed the button again, curiosity getting the better of her. A beam shot out, hitting her reflection in the mirror. In an instant, her reflection changed. Her hair turned a vibrant shade of red, her eyes shifted to a piercing green, and her skin took on a warm, golden hue. She looked like a completely different person. Marissa dropped the device, her heart racing. What had she just done? Marissa hummed to herself as she walked back upstairs, the strange device forgotten for the moment. She entered her bathroom, turning on the lights and looking at herself in the mirror. She smiled, her eyes sparkling with excitement for the night ahead. As she turned to grab her makeup, something caught her eye. Her reflection seemed... off. She turned back to look, tilting her head in confusion. Her hair, once a dark brown, now shimmered like gold under the harsh bathroom lights. Her eyes, usually a warm hazel, were now a piercing emerald green. And her skin... it was as if she had been kissed by the sun, a warm golden hue replacing her usual pale complexion. Marissa gasped, touching her face in shock. What the...? she muttered, her heart pounding in her chest. She rushed back downstairs, grabbing the device from the box on the couch. She pressed the button, pointing it at herself. A beam shot out, hitting her square in the chest. She felt a wave of heat wash over her, and then... nothing. She looked down at herself, expecting to see some change, but she was still the same Marissa she had always been. She sighed, disappointed. Guess it&#39;s just a fancy flashlight, she grumbled, setting it back down. Just as she was about to turn away, she felt a strange sensation in her stomach. It was a warmth, a pressure, building and building until she thought she might burst. She looked down, her eyes widening in shock as she watched her belly swell, growing round and firm. Her pajama top was obliterated into a belly blouse against the sudden growth, the seams groaning in protest. She stumbled back, her hands going to her now massive gut, feeling the soft flesh jiggle beneath her touch. Marissa looked up at herself in the mirror across the room, her reflection now that of a giantess. She stood at least eight feet tall, her body thick and curvy in all the right places. Her breasts were enormous, straining against her top, her nipples hard and visible through the thin fabric. Her thighs were thick, her ass round and full. And her stomach... it was a mountain of flesh, hanging low and heavy, her belly button peeking out from the center of her gut. She prodded at her newfound fat, poking at her fupa with sausage-like fingers. She laughed, a deep, throaty sound that filled the room. <br />
“I&#39;m a goddess” she declared, a twisted smug grin spreading across her face. <br />
“A golden goddess.”<br />
<br />
Marissa turned to look out the window, spotting a very fat middle-aged woman jogging past. An idea sparked in her mind, a wicked gleam in her new emerald eyes. She picked up the device, pressing the button and pointing it at the woman outside. The beam hit the woman square in the back and watched with amusement as the middle-aged woman outside began to change. The jogger stopped in her tracks, looking around in confusion as her body started to shrink. Her once plump frame began to dwindle, her clothes becoming loose and baggy as her flesh melted away.<br />
<br />
 She looked down at herself in shock, her hands going to her now non-existent belly, feeling only skin and bone. <br />
“What&#39;s happening to me?”<br />
 she cried out, her voice shrill with panic. Marissa could hear her clearly, despite the distance between them. She smirked, enjoying the woman&#39;s distress. The jogger&#39;s face was a mask of horror as she watched her arms thin out, her muscles disappearing until only skin and bone remained. Her breasts shrank, becoming mere shadows of their former selves, and her ass flattened out. Her thighs grew smaller, her calves disappearing until she was left standing on two sticks, her feet barely more than bones wrapped in skin. Marissa pridefully prodded at her own fupa, feeling the soft flesh jiggle as she watched the woman&#39;s body continue to dwindle. The jogger&#39;s hair thinned out, her once lustrous locks falling out in clumps until she was left with nothing but a few wisps of hair on her scalp. Her eyes, once bright and full of life, were now sunken into her skull, her cheeks hollow and gaunt. The woman reached up to touch her face, her fingers brushing against her now prominent cheekbones. She let out a wail of terror as she realized what was happening to her. Marissa laughed, a deep, throaty sound that echoed through the night.<br />
“ Please!”<br />
 the jogger begged, tears streaming down her face. <br />
“Please, stop this”. Marissa just smiled, her emerald eyes gleaming with malice. <br />
“Why should I?”<br />
 she asked, her voice a low purr. <br />
“You&#39;re just a little snack for my new diet.”<br />
The jogger&#39;s eyes widened in horror as Marissa raised the device, pointing it at her again. The beam hit her square in the chest, and she let out a scream that was cut off abruptly as her body began to disintegrate. Her skin turned to dust, her bones crumbling to nothingness until there was nothing left of her but a pile of clothes on the ground. Marissa licked her lips, feeling a strange ethereal corrupted hunger gnawing at her insides. She looked out into the night, a wicked grin spreading across her face. <br />
“Time for dessert!”<br />
 she declared, stepping out into the night, her massive form casting a long shadow over the quiet suburban neighborhood.</p>
