<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wayne walked under the decrepit doorway of Matt’s second-floor apartment, throwing his denim jacket off and away. It clung desperately to the rim of a dining room chair before slipping to the floor. He collapsed into the couch, on top of where Matt was laying down and watching television. <br />
<br />
“Got something new up your sleeve? You won’t get it past me. I can tell when you’re up to something...” <br />
<br />
Matt blinked doubly at his boyfriend. Could he possibly remember--<br />
<br />
Wayne rolled his eyes. “That’s what he said to me today! Right in front of Domas. He’s a total bitch.” Domas was Wayne’s (straight) coworker friend. <br />
<br />
Matt exhaled. “... I was going to ask how work was, but--”<br />
<br />
“Oh, you know... same old shit. The devs not knowing anything. Not enough staff. Stupid money decisions... ”<br />
<br />
Wayne shrugged it off. “But I guess I’m here.” He turned over to Matt, and they shared a kiss.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, hun. You didn’t invite me over to hear me complain about work.” He smiled lovingly at Matt as he put down his cellphone on the coffee table, closed his eyes, and let his head fall back into the cushions.<br />
<br />
“So, um…” Matt started procedurally, hesitating over the question he had in his mind. “...Did you notice anything different about yourself last night or today?”<br />
<br />
Wayne opened his eyes. He had a quizzical look on his face. “Anything <i>different?</i> As in...”<br />
<br />
Matt just stared. <br />
<br />
“...Your body.”<br />
<br />
Wayne turned and blinked. <br />
<br />
“No?” <br />
<br />
Matt diverted his attention to the desk where the Chronivac box package sat next to the device. A little red dot on the scanner blinked, as if it were listening to the conversation with delight.<br />
<br />
“Should… I know about something? What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
Matt violently shook his head. “No! Nothing’s wrong. I was… uh, just hoping that we were… all good from last night.”<br />
<br />
Wayne furrowed his eyebrows, and smirked, turning to look Matt in the eyes. “You’ve <i>got</i> me, love. Don’t worry about losing me... if you think I was pissed about last night, I wasn’t. I had to leave stupidly early for work. Like I said, they’ve been ultra-bitchy lately and--”<br />
<br />
“Okay awesome cool so if you’re up for it there&#39;s something I want to, uh, try?” Matt wrung his hands. That sentence came out a lot faster than he had expected! He was going to chicken out, wasn’t he... This nervousness was eating him up inside. <br />
<br />
“I mean, you were <i>on fire.</i> After last night, you could read me the dictionary and I’d want to listen.”<br />
<br />
“Oh… well, okay.” Matt sat up on the couch, nudging his head toward the computer screen. “Just stay here… I’ve got to look at something first.”<br />
	<br />
“... Oka--” <br />
“--BUT if you notice anything weird, you gotta let me know, okay?!”<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
“Can I get something to eat?” Wayne asked innocently.<br />
<br />
“I guess...”<br />
<br />
Wayne was about to get up himself, but then he smirked that smirk he smirks when a smirk-worthy moment becomes smirk-worthy. Matt was doing something for him. <br />
<br />
“Wait… Are you looking up something… <i>sexy?</i>” <br />
<br />
Matt absentmindedly nodded. “You could say that.”<br />
<br />
Wayne giggled. “Quick to the punch, aren’t ya? You’re such a cutie-pie sometimes. How ‘bout I make some roasted potatoes for dinner? Then… we can see what it is you&#39;re looking up while they cook.”<br />
<br />
Matt fidgeted more with his hands. At the computer desk, he had a clear view of Wayne. He began fussing with a knife in the kitchen. Matt shook the mouse to wake the computer up from its asleep, opened the Chronivac application, and turned on the device to scan the room. Within range, he easily obtained Wayne’s details. <br />
<br />
It worked so flawlessly. It didn’t even make any noise. <br />
<br />
The choice had been made already. He had prepared something before Wayne got there, something he really wanted to do, a dream transformation he had fantasized often that would be perfect for his boyfriend: a satyr.<br />
<br />
The built-in package provided painstakingly lovely details about the mythological creature of passion, as they were interpreted by the Romans and how influential they were in media and culture today. By default, the package was designed around the idea of the creature being half-human and half-goat. But, just like the Horse package, there was a long list of parameters available that allowed nearly endless ideas for customization. There were several different interpretations out there as to what a satyr was (percentage of goat), hundreds of other species to choose from, and a plethora of possible sub-options. <br />
<br />
Most importantly, there was the ability to redefine reality, which - if Matt’s hypothesis about last night was correct - meant Wayne wouldn’t notice.<br />
<br />
The customizations didn’t matter so much to Matt. He needed to find out whether or not Wayne’s sense of things would adjust to the change accordingly, as it happened. He did pick a beautiful variation of the default values, but kept things to the traditional satyr. He set the Reality Modification rating to 50%, just like before, and kept the Transformation Period set to two minutes. <br />
<br />
If this all worked... he’d extend the morph period time until he was inspired to try the next thing.<br />
<br />
With stifled breath, he gave a quick glance at Wayne, then giggled the last of the nerves away. Just the thought of having a satyr boyfriend… his heart throbbed with eagerness!<br />
<br />
Matt clicked the Next button to begin the process. The screen flipped to a progress bar... and the computer unexpectedly beeped. <i>Loudly.</i><br />
<br />
Wayne’s chopping stopped. “What was that…?” he asked in an accusatory tone, looking directly at Matt, stuck in mid-chop of another potato.<br />
<br />
“N-nothing…”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, right!” Wayne laughed. “Work ran me ragged today, man… I don’t need any more surprises or… randomly beeping machines.”<br />
<br />
In those first ten seconds, not much of anything happened. Matt’s anxiety must’ve been apparent; was it working? When he had transformed his cock, he felt the changes immediately. But this was someone else, obviously. And if Wayne didn’t think anything of it…<br />
<br />
“Potatoes are such a great vegetable. So filling and… they always smell great.”<br />
<br />
“I thought they weren’t actually veg--”<br />
<br />
Matt lost connection with Wayne’s anecdote… he saw it. Them, actually. Two little nubs. They were breaking through the skin of the temples on his forehead, just below his hairline. Was it the lighting in the kitchen playing tricks on him?<br />
<br />
No. They were his satyr horns. No doubt. It was confirmed with each passing second by how rapidly they were growing out. <br />
<br />
Yet Wayne continued to talk about potatoes and prepare dinner. Probably for the best, too. It wasn’t a cursory glance that Matt made at Wayne; he was full-on staring him down at this point. He unconsciously watched the horns grow, centimeter by centimeter, but slowly realized in his mind what was actually happening. So far, Wayne hadn’t noticed.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know… even if they were apples, who cares?”<br />
<br />
Right then and there, Wayne’s pants split open on the fronts of his thighs, abruptly at first but slowly over time. The tears in the fabric revealed his well-toned runner muscles. However, the skin looked different. There was a faint but vibrant shade of silvery-brown hair. <br />
<br />
Wayne dropped the last potato on the cutting board. “Oh shit, my pants! Matt, I… I’m sorry but… hhh…” <br />
<br />
He stopped chopping with the knife, his mind perplexed. He scratched at some fuzz on his chin.<br />
<br />
“... I don’t need… can…”<br />
<br />
Then Matt’s eyes went wide as Wayne abruptly and unconsciously tore off the remaining shreds of black trouser fabric with his hands. It was so random. And now he was nearly naked from the waist down, save for his boxer briefs. <br />
<br />
Then he kicked off his work shoes, which had begun to look like they were being pulled at the ends. They would’ve ripped apart like his trousers if left on his presumably elongating feet. From Matt’s point of view, Wayne’s legs were unshaven, disheveled, and misshapen. His feet were discolored, especially his toenails. But, as the seconds ticked by, Wayne’s stance changed to be like the haunched way a goat stood on hind legs. Then, with one final rip, his boxers ripped across the powerful thigh muscles, revealing the most precious parts of his maleness. They weren’t yet fully covered with hair, er, fur… so ... he was fully exposed.<br />
<br />
“Can you get this stuff out of the kitchen?”<br />
<br />
Matt silently got up from his chair. Wayne’s feet continued growing longer. Each toe was covered completely by what were his toenails, and were dark brown in color; a solid contrast from his human skin, but a destitute match to his… fur. They no longer looked human, but that didn’t bother Wayne. He absentmindedly shifted his stance again, onto the ends of his toes. His left foot, changing a bit faster than the right, started melding where the toenails wrapped around his toes, trailed by a shade of deep grey hairs. Then his right foot: much of the same. With this sense of unusual and temporary imbalance, Wayne used the kitchen counter to prevent himself from falling over.<br />
<br />
“I must be more tired than I thought...”<br />
<br />
Roughly a minute had passed. The horns on his head continued to grow out - they now accentuated the shape of his head by curving away and back over his messy blonde hair. Viewing Wayne from his side, Matt could see the shape of Wayne’s face protruding ever so slightly; that was part of a variation of the default package. His rather mundane ears were becoming more pointed, shifting higher up the sides of his head, pulling unshaven skin along with them. Generally speaking, he was still looking like “Wayne”, but he was enhanced with new features. It was an improvement with each blink of the eye.<br />
<br />
“C’mon, please pick these up or I’ll trip over ‘em. You shouldn’t leave your shoes lying around the apartment…”<br />
<br />
Wayne was always beautiful, but he was becoming an absolute dreamboat with each passing second. So beautiful, in fact, that he felt the need to obey his command, no questions asked. The shoes were Wayne’s, not his - but if he didn’t need them… did reality change that? <br />
<br />
Matt stumbled a bit as he picked up the pants and shoes next to Wayne&#39;s now goat-like feet. <br />
<br />
“Thanks, love. So… This thing you wanna try…” <br />
<br />
Nerves got the best of him and he began back-pedalling to the computer desk.  “I…. I’m --”<br />
<br />
“Is it something new? Is it… risqué?”<br />
<br />
Wayne’s legs were full of umber-colored fur that completely covered his thighs, and it flowed down to his caprine ankles, now officially hocked and inhuman. On each foot were two large “toes”, and he was struggling less to support his weight on them. A couple of moments passed by, and he fully stiffened his stance. His toes had become cloven hooves. Higher up his legs, Matt was pleasantly aware of Wayne’s complementary ‘package’. And above his rear, a nubby little tail covered in brown and white fur popped out. The cute thing wiggled about beneath the coattails of his dress shirt, as if to say “Hello!”. Wayne tugged the shirt around it to hide, undoubtedly, some pristine and accentuated ab muscles. <br />
<br />
“Okay... did you hear me? I’m feeling better... Must’ve been hoof-lock or something.”<br />
<br />
“H-h-h…uhh...”<br />
<br />
“Yeah...” Wayne began, kicking up his hooves one at a time. Like a goat. <br />
<br />
Matt covered his mouth to stop making spastic noises. He had to get it together! The machine was supposed to work, there is nothing about this that should be shocking… but oh my god… the Chronivac really *did* burst the proverbial door wide open! Whatever his heart desired… he could have it.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know what you’d call it. For humans, I mean. You know… pasterns get sore sometimes, especially when I have to stand all day.” He turned to Matt briefly and smiled. “My hooves were trimmed last week… they did a good job… but today sucked balls.”<br />
<br />
Wayne’s caprine facial features were nearly realized. He looked so rustic and wild, a combination of so many things he liked in his men. Still human, to a fault, but his masculinities were accentuated. His nose was wider, from the bridge all the way down to the tips of his nostrils, which flared a bit at the corners. If he didn’t know any better, his eyes were a bit more goat-like, too. You know, with horizontally angled pupils. He still looked like Wayne, <i>his</i> Wayne. But there was a testosterone-driven animalistic fervor to this version of Wayne that would make a man fall lustfully to his knees. Matt was seething with envy; he felt his own vanity grieving with jealousy. He loved him even more this way, but God did he want to know how Wayne felt… in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
“<i>Now</i> you’re quiet... What did you find? I can smell you getting hard!”<br />
<br />
That last little quip broke the bewilderment that Matt was feeling. He could smell his hardon? Suddenly he realized how hard he <i>was</i> getting, and it was proudly pushing against the zipper of his jeans.<br />
<br />
“Okay...” Wayne said, putting the knife down on the chopping board and turning directly to him. “Something caught your imagination.”<br />
<br />
“N-no…”<br />
<br />
Right then, the Chronivac rang out. The two minutes were up. Matt found himself staring down a true-blooded satyr in his apartment kitchen. More to the point, that satyr was his boyfriend Wayne. He had turned Wayne into a satyr, and he was the most gorgeous satyr possible.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see it, <i>now...</i>” Wayne said to Matt as he walked over, his cloven hooves audibly clopping on the synthetic tile. Was Wayne getting hard too? <br />
<br />
“Once you get going, this satyr’s job begins...”<br />
<br />
Matt quivered nervously, his excitement showing in the colors of his face. He unleashed himself from the desk chair into Wayne’s arms, and wrapped an arm around his back. Wayne pulled him in against his chest. He smelled like pine trees… like a bonfire. Pure masculine essence.<br />
<br />
“W-Wayne… I… love you so much, I--”<br />
<br />
Wayne put a finger on Matt’s lips. “That’s all I need to hear.”<br />
<br />
It was like a movie scene. With one hand, Wayne rubbed Matt’s crotch with help from the fabric of his jeans, and Matt responded with a pleasurable moan. Wayne knew how sensitive he was to certain textures. It was the beginning of what was increasingly inevitable: Matt felt Wayne ushering him backward against his bedroom door, and when they got inside the room he let himself drop onto the bed sheets.<br />
<br />
Then Wayne draped himself like a sheet over him. Matt let his mind run free. He ran his fingers through the fur on Wayne’s leg while Wayne’s lips worked their magic. It was overwhelming; otherworldly; heavenly. Matt latched on to the coattails of Wayne’s shirt and pulled it up and over his horns. Off it came, finally exposing Wayne’s cultured, hairy, and well-toned chest.<br />
<br />
Time slipped by quickly after that. The room got hot and heavy. There was sweat covering both of them that soaked the linens. Matt let himself go, but he couldn’t hold on like this forever. The sexual fantasy was so unbelievable, he gave release the moment he felt Wayne’s tongue on the tip of his cock. <br />
<br />
“Oh!” Wayne said, unlocking his tongue to emphasize astonishment.  “Hung like a horse but made like a man, eh?”<br />
<br />
The quickie was over before it had begun. Wayne’s alpha dominance and brutal confidence were very new to him. Wayne acted like he lived for unplanned sex, as if his entire purpose for existing was to teach Matt the art of love. He embodied the Roman myth in virtually every way physically, and Matt was trying to recover from learning what that meant emotionally. He was painfully hard, and it wouldn’t go down.<br />
<br />
He was a happy mess, completely engulfed by this pure feeling of adoration. Wayne was the same guy he had fallen in love with, but this aura about him that he created for the sex was something that he couldn’t explain. <br />
<br />
It dawned on Matt how pleasuresome this new reality was. They cuddled together on the bed for a few minutes, savoring the warmth and comfort of each other’s bodies. Matt explored the contours of Wayne’s body with his left hand, and played around with Wayne’s balls with his right. He let Matt fondle the hairs on his chest, and Wayne gave him soft kisses. Matt breathed in the heated, musky air, and smiled. <br />
<br />
Some time later, in the other room… the computer beeped. Matt heard it. <br />
<br />
He didn’t want to get up. He was so deeply in love with Wayne. But then he started feeling a smoothness to Wayne’s legs returning. It took a couple moments for him to remember the detail, but he realized that the transformation hadn’t been saved within an hour. Wayne was reverting. <br />
<br />
Without a word, he bounced out of bed and sprinted to his computer. <br />
<br />
“Woah!?” Wayne yipped, caught off-guard.<br />
<br />
Matt collapsed into his desk chair. As suspected, the screen was counting backwards from two minutes.<br />
<br />
“Did that noise come from your computer?”<br />
<br />
“Uhh, yeah… Just an email, I think!”<br />
<br />
He had to save the change within an hour or it would revert by default, and he had no idea how long it had been. He lost track of time. He tried to click the Save button on the screen, but it couldn’t be clicked. Then he tried Cancel.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He tried entering two days, pressing Save again, furiously cancelling the procedures...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Matt sighed, half-depressed. He had been once again defeated by the arbitrarian rules of the Chronivac. Such as life; all good things have to come to an end. Or do they? <br />
<br />
He was about to restart the process when he turned to his left… Wayne was standing in the doorway. He had lost most of his caprine definitions, the reality of his humanity slowly returning. In some ways it was relieving because it meant Wayne wasn’t involuntarily stuck, but there was a sense of unsettled distress in the room.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… you didn’t have to get up--”<br />
<br />
“Okay. For real. What are you doing? I want to know.”<br />
<br />
He waved dismissively. “It’s nothing, don’t worry... In fact, I’m done.”<br />
<br />
“Done with…” Wayne hesitated. He looked around the apartment for clues, but everything looked relatively normal. So it was something on the computer. He sighed. <br />
<br />
“Never mind then. Guess I&#39;ll finish cook -- oh, uh, grab my PJs from the bathroom for me? I think I ripped my work clothes...”</p>
