<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Matt was in Jake&#39;s room posing in the speedo, Jake was getting out of the shower and drying off with a towel when the change began. It started slowly and subtly with his spine stretching, making him taller and bringing him to a height of 6,2 and some strips of his hair began to shorten and turn blond the same as Matt. Jake looked in the mirror and noticed the changes that were happening to his body, &quot;What the fu-&quot; he began to say but was cut off as a shock went through his body and he fell on the floor. It was from this point on that the changes began to speed up. To match his height Jake aged to 25 in his prime and started to gain muscle, it started with his chest with his pecs beefing up and defining into two strong slabs of muscle then it moved to his abs, creating a tight defined six pack where it was smooth before expanding to his arms and legs inflating his biceps and triceps then making thighs and calves strong as diamonds. The tingle promptly spread to his feet turning his previous size 9&#39;s to a whopping size 13! It didn&#39;t stop there though it did to his hands what it did to his feet sizing them up with the rest of his body inflating them to huge paddles &quot;perfect for swimming in the water&quot; Jake thought. it was here that Jake&#39;s changes entered the final lap inflating his package turning his measly previous 4&#39; dick into a 6&#39; cock (10&#39; at full erection.) As the hair on his body finished turning his brother&#39;s shade of blond his pubes grew giving him a sexy treasure trail up to his navel, his armpit hair grew in and then was promptly shaven back as was all the other hair on his body excluding his head hair and the treasure trail, his hair shortened and styled into a swimmer cut while his face lost all the remaining baby fat turning more angular and sharp with a clean shave and piercing green eyes while a prominent Adams Apple formed on his neck. <br />
<br />
It was at this point when Jake got up off the Bathroom floor and groaned into a sexy Baritone voice &quot;What happened to me?&quot; Jake then realized what his voice sounded like &quot; what the hell is wrong with my voice?&quot; Jake questioned to the mirror &quot;and why do I look almost identical to Matt?!&quot; (his body has plenty of muscle but he was still lean without being too much) It was this trigger that sparked the final change in his mind. Jake clutched his head in agony as his mind reworked itself, memories shifting, mind changing... Jake then remembered that he was Matt&#39;s identical twin brother and that they had come home to visit their parents before they graduated College. He and his brother were famous for their mastery in the pool and the ocean with aquatic sports, swimming, rowing surfing you name it Matt and Jake were in charge of all of them as co-captains and the most valuable people of the teams because of their perfection at all of them and in class they were just as good being some of the smartest people being &quot;irreplaceable&quot; as their coach&#39;s has said. They were called &quot;The Twin Sharks&quot; and they were going to university soon after receiving scholarships for their athletic and academic prowess. As Jake was taking the information from &quot;his&quot; memories he looked down at his shoulder and saw a tattoo of a Japanese character &quot;W-what&#39;s that?&quot; he asked before a tingle in his brain reminded him that he and his brother had gotten tattoos to strengthen their bond and so people could tell them apart. The character was &quot;Shark&quot; and Jake had it on his left shoulder because he was left handed and Matt&#39;s was on his right shoulder for the same reason. Jake then went down to what used to be his room, now an empty storage space, to greet his twin. Though Jake was mainly the one changed Matt had some minor alterations too like his hair had changed to a swimmer cut he got more of an aquatic build and of course the tattoo. &quot;Here bro put some clothes on&quot; Matt said tossing him a pale blue t-shirt and some baggy jeans &quot;I already packed our stuff have you said goodbye to mom and dad?&quot; he asked. &quot;Yeah I have&quot; Jake responded let&#39;s go.&quot; They dragged their stuff downstairs to the car they both saved up to buy, dumped everything in the trunk then drove off back to college for graduation and University.</p>
