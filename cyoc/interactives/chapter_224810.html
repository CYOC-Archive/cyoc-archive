<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David Erinson groaned again. His 7-inch dick was not wanting to be ignored. His pussy ached with need, even though it felt like he had already been filled up today. He usually took care of things at home with his largest dildos before coming to work. He wouldn&#39;t be able to concentrate otherwise. But this feeling felt different. He felt like he was ready for a second round of fucking, not for another round on his dildo or vibrator. But he hadn&#39;t been fucked for a while now. At 43 years old, he wasn&#39;t the dick and pussy hound he used to be. Lately, he had been trying to date women who could please both his 9-inch dick and his vag at the same time, but that venture had been unsuccessful. He honestly couldn&#39;t remember the last time he got railed good and properly by a big, thick, throbbing...<br />
<br />
His office phone rang, jarring David out of his daydream. He hadn&#39;t realized he had been massaging his crotch and grinding into his chair. His eyes moved away from the banner of Rocky the Wolf, an anthropomorphized version of the school mascot. The phone continued ringing, and David calmed his breathing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coach Erinson speaking,&quot; he said. &quot;Who am I speaking to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, you forget to look at Caller ID or something, Coach?&quot; a familiar voice spoke on the other end. &quot;It&#39;s a new invention, you may not have heard of it.&quot; It was Coach Luke Darner, David&#39;s 28-year-old offensive coordinator. He was okay enough at his job. But he got easily stuck in his own head and would forget some important details. He also had a tendency to poke fun at David frequently, but he never did it in front of the players, so David couldn&#39;t bring himself to complain about it. Much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, just because your eyes can read these damn monochrome school Caller IDs doesn&#39;t mean my dog eyes can,&quot; David grumbled. &quot;What do you want, or did you just call to waste my time? I&#39;ve got a lot of paperwork to get done before today&#39;s practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheesh, I was only playin&#39;, Coach,&quot; Luke replied. &quot;No harm no foul.&quot; He heard a bark on the other end of the line. David instinctually sat up. &quot;Easy, boy, we&#39;re almost there.&quot; David heard Luke say. &quot;Sorry, Rocky hates riding in my puny ass car. But he&#39;s why I&#39;m calling. Laurena said that she had appointments and errands to run all day today and couldn&#39;t find a dog sitter in time. She was hoping that it would be okay to have him stay in your office until I can take him back after practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes, ahem, yes, that&#39;s fine,&quot; David said. Rocky was the school mascot. He wasn&#39;t actually a wolf, just a really handsome husky. Handsome? Why did David think that? A part of him seemed strangely eager to have Rocky spending the rest of the day with him. His pussy, just as strangely, agreed. &quot;You can leave him with me. He&#39;ll, I mean, <i>I&#39;ll</i> take good care of him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, seriously? Coach, you rock!&quot; Luke said, oblivious to David&#39;s stammering. &quot;I&#39;ll drop him off with you, and I&#39;ll tidy up the locker room for you in return. Does that work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds fine,&quot; David said, squeezing his thighs against his 11-inch dick. He could feel the heat radiating off of it through his pants. He cleared his throat. &quot;W-when will he be here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m about five minutes away, tops,&quot; Luke answered. &quot;Thanks again, Coach.&quot; He hung up.<br />
<br />
David dropped the phone and began to rub his dick more fervently. Something about that conversation really amped up his horniness to the max. He couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something was wrong, that nothing should be making him this horny in the first place. His pussy felt damp. David had the strangest feeling that he needed to tidy himself up. He needed to be able to... look good? That didn&#39;t seem to fit exactly what he was feeling. But he couldn&#39;t be too bothered by it. He stood up and went into his office&#39;s private bathroom to get cleaned up.<br />
<br />
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jake finally returned to class with Sparky in tow. Sparky seemed tired but eager to be around Jake. Jake couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something happened with the golden retriever. The way his pussy fluttered at the faintest touch of that inaccessible memory made Jake think that, whatever it was, it was <i>special</i>. His cock in his sheath began to stir. Jake breathed deeply, hoping to not have to readjust himself again so soon after jacking off in the toilet earlier. Though for some reason, that felt like a year ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, you&#39;re back?&quot; Mr. Howens said when he heard the clacking of Sparky&#39;s nails on the tile floor. &quot;Everything okay? You were gone a while. The period is almost over, if my timing is correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; came the chorused response of the class almost on cue. Seconds later, the bell rang to mark the end of the period.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Mr. Howens,&quot; Jake replied, handing the leash off. &quot;Sparky, uh, really had to go... a-a lot. He sure seems like a strong healthy dog or at least eating that way, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aha, thank you, Jake, but I did not need that much detail,&quot; Mr. Howens replied. &quot;Now run along to your next class. You don&#39;t want to be late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Jake said. He smiled at Sparky. &quot;See ya, boy.&quot; Sparky wagged his tail but remained silent. He was in work-mode after all now. Jake got the oddest sense that Sparky was really proud of something just in simply the look he gave Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, here&#39;s your stuff,&quot; Marcus said. He gave Jake an odd look, or rather, more specifically, his chest. They left the classroom.</p>
