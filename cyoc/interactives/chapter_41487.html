<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After dinner in which your uncle had meatloaf and you had a green grape your uncle cast the discovery spell. This involved you standing in a circle while your uncle chanted in a strange language for a couple of minutes. When he was finished you knew that your new name was Janetta, or Jan for short. You even know that you're just 3.18% your normal height. This made you 2.0034 inches but who was really counting that .0034 inch. Once that was done you explored some of the nook and crannies in your uncle's house. Once it was time for bed you had your uncle close the bathroom door so you could return to being human to use the toilet. You had almost tried to pee standing up which would have been embarrassing and messy. You also had your uncle close your bedroom door so you could sleep comfortably. You didn't think you would be very comfortable trying to sleep with wings.<br />
<br />
Your uncle woke you up in the morning and after breakfast went down to the shop. There was a lady already there and your uncle said &quot;Good morning Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Jack&quot; Janice said. She had sandy brown hair, dark green eyes, and she stood about five foot four. She looked to be about eighteen years old and she was wearing a sleeveless t-shirt that showed a bit of cleavage, a denim mini skirt, and a pair of sandals.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to meet my new niece&quot; your uncle said. &quot;Janice, this is Janetta. Janetta, this is Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your nephew put on a fairy costume huh&quot; Janice said. &quot;Let me guess, you need me to measure her and take her shopping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Apparently Janice was the one who took care of the male to female transformations. Your uncle nodded and said &quot;At least she's a fairy and you can have some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we'll have fun alright&quot; Janice said. &quot;Something tells me that she'll prefer to be called Jan. Am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah&quot; you said blushing a bit. &quot;Janetta is a bit long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I prefer to be called Janice&quot; Janice said. &quot;I don't like my name shortened to Jan. Well we should get you measured. Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You followed Janice to a room off to the side of the changing rooms. You hadn't noticed it before. Maybe that was because the door looked like it was part of the wall. Once inside Janice picked up a cloth measuring tape and said &quot;I can't measure you unless you're human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'll be naked&quot; you said embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't do anything to you&quot; Janice said kindly. &quot;I'll try not to touch you in a way that makes you uncomfortable. Though we do need to get your measurements.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not worried about that&quot; you said. &quot;It's just that I won't have any clothes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see&quot; Janice said. &quot;So you're feeling uncomfortable about being nude in front of someone else. I can understand that. You've been stripped of your male body and now find yourself in a female body. I've seen this before. Nearly every male to female feels like that at first. They've been in their male body for so long that they can hardly believe that their dream has come true. I went through the same thing three years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you wanted to be a girl?&quot; you asked shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Janice said. &quot;That's why we put on female costumes from your uncle's shop after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I put this on as a joke&quot; you said miserably. &quot;I didn't think that my uncle was a wizard. I never would have tried this costume on otherwise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't want to be a girl?&quot; Janice asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; you said hanging your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you poor thing&quot; Janice said. &quot;Costume change.&quot; You watch as Janice begins to shrink. As she shrunk her clothes changed. Her shirt and skirt fused together to form a dress and changed to a light blue that you thought was called ice blue. The dress lengthened until the hem was down to just past her knees. Her sandals disappeared completely. As she was approaching her final height as a fairy two ice blue wings grew from her back. Once she was done transforming she flew up to you and hugged you. &quot;I'm sorry&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I just assumed that you had wanted to be a girl. I didn't think anyone would put on a costume as a joke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok&quot; you said comforted. &quot;I shouldn't have put it on in the first place. I know that I need some new clothes. I'll become human again so you can measure me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You both landed on the floor and said &quot;Costume revert&quot; at the same time. Janice's changes reversed themselves from what you had witnessed. Your transformation was the same except that your dress and panties faded away as you grew.<br />
<br />
Once you were both human again you asked &quot;How tall are you as a fairy? You were a little taller than I was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my exact height is 2.0352 inches as a fairy&quot; Janice said. &quot;Though I usually just say that I'm two inches. Nobody really cares about three hundreths of an inch. Now to measure you.&quot; She took the cloth tape measure and started measuring you. When she was done she said &quot;Well we're done here. Turn back into a fairy and we'll go to the mall.&quot;<br />
<br />
You returned to being a fairy and followed Janice back out into the shop. Your uncle stopped her and said &quot;Here's money for her clothes.&quot; He handed Janice what appeared to be a thousand dollars. &quot;Treat her to a day at the spa too&quot; he said with a sour smile. &quot;She deserves to be pampered a bit today. Don't worry about working today. I've called Marla in to help me. You two go have some fun shopping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a sweet boss Jack&quot; Janice said giving him a kiss on the cheek. She grabbed a purse from behind the counter and put the money in it. She walked out the dorr holding it for you to fly threw before letting it shut. &quot;I hope you're ready for a nice flight&quot; she said. &quot;We'll have to stop between here and the mall in order to eat. Fortunately I know the fastest way from here. We'll be flying over the tops of the buildings. Just watch out for birds. They usually don't try eating fairies. If one does eat you though flap your wings furiously and dislodge fairy dust. It will make the bird sick and it will regurgitate you.&quot; She became a fairy and she took off.<br />
<br />
You followed her and you were amazed by how fast you were going. Despite how far away the mall was you reached it in an hour stopping for five minutes to eat some berries from a bush. Once at the mall Janice resumed human form and lead you inside.<br />
<br />
Janice headed straight for a teen girl clothing store. Inside you were astounded by all the clothes available. As you flew past some dresses you noticed one that looked ok. Janice had been walking right behind you and noticing you looking at it picked it up to show you. &quot;Do you like this sun dress?&quot; she asked. It was a light blue with no sleeves and looked like it would be pretty comfortable.<br />
<br />
You nod and say &quot;It looks comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sun dresses usually are pretty comfortable&quot; Janice said. &quot;We'll get you some underwear, a strapless bra, and some sandals so you can wear something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Janice&quot; a sales woman said coming up to her. &quot;Shopping for anoth male to female I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An accidental one I'm afraid&quot; Janice said. &quot;She tried on a fairy coustume in her uncles shop as a joke not realizing that it was enchanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear&quot; the sales lady said putting her hand on her chest. &quot;The poor thing. She must be freaked out about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would say&quot; Janice said. &quot;I'll introduce you to her.&quot; She pointed to you and said &quot;Jan, this is Marge. Marge, this is Jan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleasure to meet you&quot; Marge said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yeah... hi&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you need help with anything just let me know&quot; Marge said. &quot;I hope that you find some joy in being female Jan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I love the flying part&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that is a bright spot&quot; Marge said smiling and walked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;So let's go get you some underwear&quot; Janice suggested.<br />
<br />
You ended up picking out a pack of light colored panties, brown leather sandals, and a strapless bra that Janice said was light enough to go with the sun dress. She took all of these things to a changing room. Once you were in she closed the door but didn't leave. &quot;Why are you still in here?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you'll need some help putting that stuff on&quot; Janice replied. &quot;Unless you want to try to figure it out yourself you'll want my help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Knowing that she was right you sighed and said &quot;I guess I do need help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice opened the package of panties while you returned to being human and handed you a pair of light blue panties. Next she showed you how to put on the bra, placing it and reaching behind to clasp it. You still needed to adjust it as it was a strapless bra. After she took the tag off the bra she had you put on the sun dress. She took the tags off of that too and finally had you put on the sandals after separating them. She turned you to the mirror in the changing room and said &quot;You look great!&quot;<br />
<br />
You could see what she meant. The light blue sun dress went well with your platinum blond hair and electric blue eyes. You knew that if you had still been male you would have been sporting a boner to see such a beauty. Now you were just stunned at how you looked. You were starting to think that maybe being a girl wouldn't be so bad.<br />
<br />
You left the changing room and continued shopping. When you were done you had four other dresses, two bikinis, three pairs of sandals, five denim mini skirts, five pairs of shorts, ten different bras, two more packs of panties, and twenty shirts, half with short sleeves and the other half with no sleeves. After everything was paid for Janice said &quot;Now it's time for you to be pampered. You'll love the spa.&quot;<br />
<br />
You thought that she was going to be right about that.</p>
