<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Dude, sorry about the delays on this one again, had personal business that needed taking <br />
care of.) <br />
<br />
The damaged tabby cat boiled over from his spot in Madam Serenity's arms and snapped <br />
back at last, &quot;I gave Mary the word for my curse for HER, not because I think being stuck <br />
as a cat is -better!-  And she gets thumbs, bipedal legs, and a human life span -and- <br />
people are gonna treat her as a person. Give me those and I wouldn't be moaning as <br />
much. I don't have a choice about being stuck like this, I gave Mary what I DIDN'T get! A <br />
choice! Jennifer hasn't given anyone a choice! So don't go dumping ME in the same basket <br />
as -him!-  &quot; <br />
<br />
Serenity wanted to physically scold Trevor on his actions but she didn't want to break him <br />
further than his body had been already. &quot;Trevor, be polite. Gill's been enduring things <br />
longer than you have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's no reason to dump me in the same boat as the enemy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's cause-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gill! PLEASE! Don't... just don't... if we do, we're going to end up divided, which is the last <br />
thing we need and is the one thing the wolves would love more than anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill for that virtue alone chose not tell the mangy cat what he thought. <br />
<br />
Madam Serenity asked, &quot;Do you still have that 'special spot' set aside for me in the lab?&quot; <br />
<br />
Gill sighed, &quot;Yes, your key will still work too, just don't ask me what possessed me to keep <br />
that garbage. That stuff's as awful as the curse if you ask me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get to work in the alchemy lab then, I should have enough cure wiped up for a two <br />
dozen wolves soon on top of what I've already made.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gill pointed out, &quot;That's not enough for seventy two victims. Not to mention... my 'men.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust you can send someone to pick up a few things from the chemist. Paul, you look <br />
after Trevor and hand out the cure I brought with me to the lionesses, write down the <br />
instructions on how they're to use them on the wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul nodded as Serenity handed off the tom tabby to the orange great ape. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't suppose you could do some fortune telling to figure out where the wolves' island <br />
is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity sighed, &quot;It's going to be more than a little hard to locate it if I don't know <br />
precisely what I'm looking for. Island full of wolves people? Sounds simple and straight <br />
foreword right? Except I need a -name- to work with, otherwise I could end up pointing <br />
us at a nature reserve.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then get to work on the cure first, we'll work on your using your hocus pocus if we find <br />
an empty manor Unc'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry I was going to.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;What about that one?&quot; Yomato pointed at the one that the lioness had seemed to <br />
intentionally place herself between the wolves and it.   It was a solid gold statue of a <br />
woman looking almost lolicon in her figure in a 'come and I shall please you' pose.  Not <br />
that any of the wolves there knew the different between solid gold and gold plated. <br />
<br />
&quot;... it's just a statue. It's dead. Nothing but solid gold. It's nothing to us. Ignore it.&quot; Amy <br />
said lying through her fangs. It seemed only she could feel when one of the statues around <br />
them had a soul, not even Zelipe could (which was odd consider the same Transform had <br />
been used to reincarnate them both). Thus no one questioned her words, and of course, <br />
who in the pack would even remotely consider the possibility that they had lied to each <br />
other? In particular a cute little thing like Amy? Thus no would question her call that the <br />
statues she pointed out as just statues were nothing but, &quot;These are all likely camouflage <br />
or someone using the 'superstition' of the game to cover up a kidnapping or murder, <br />
which no one could tell from a statufication since it's not like anyone could ask the statues <br />
if they used to be human anyway...&quot; <br />
<br />
All the wolves present nodded completely believing everything Amy said and seeing no <br />
reason to even bring it up if asked about it later. <br />
<br />
Amy knew what she saw, she did not know how she saw what she saw (and again she was <br />
quite sure her brother (wife in their previous incarnation) didn't see it either), and she saw <br />
a red thread as thin as spider silk connecting with the pink of the fallen lioness and the <br />
thumb of the statue she had been perhaps defending. Amy also noticed threads <br />
connecting to that statue and the lioness as well.  If Amy had known, she would have been <br />
perhaps enlightened to see that every statue connected by these red threads had once <br />
been a cop. <br />
<br />
Amy was somewhat confused when she realized she could see the similar thin red threads <br />
connecting the four oriental she-wolves to Yomato.  Everything in her screamed the same <br />
thing, these connected statues, were NOT meant to join the pack. <br />
<br />
All the same, this again left Amy confused and bewildered about herself, 'WHAT am I? I <br />
should be just like Zelipe... but there is something different about me...' <br />
<br />
&quot;You're a little bad wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy turned and saw Zelipe touching the lioness. They waited a few moments, nothing <br />
happened. 'So... their forms are locked too... just like ours. They left the human race <br />
behind. Just like us. And... is she willing to die to protect those dear to her? ... Just like us?' <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing?&quot; Zelipe asked confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess their forms are sealed too.&quot; Umeko calmly observed, seeing past the mountain of <br />
flesh connected to her chest like the other oriental she wolves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... it would seem so.&quot; Amy commented calmly. <br />
<br />
The small army of twelve wolves presents were disappointed at this, but of course there <br />
were more important matters to attend to.  Amy and Zelipe began their work, Amy <br />
carefully and sublimely leading her brother away from any of the statues with the <br />
connecting red threads that apparently only she could see. <br />
<br />
The unconscious lioness was left bleeding on the floor. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Penny dreamed, she dreamed in was in the armor of a Valkyrie wielding a sword with a <br />
glowing white blade underneath a clouded crimson sky with a flood of darkness around <br />
her with countless glowing yellow eyes set within wolf heads that rose and sunk within the <br />
blackness claws stretching out from it. <br />
<br />
Behind her was a draw bridge, which connected to a castle floating above a bottomless pit. <br />
<br />
&quot;None of you are getting near her... you got that-?!&quot; Penny vowed. The darkness swarmed <br />
at the lioness in armor, who swung her sword slicing through the black masses cutting <br />
them in two.  &quot;I won't give up! Not now! NOT EVER!&quot; <br />
<br />
There was no end to them, but there was also no end to her endurance, she continued to <br />
cut stab and slash at them, never stopping for breath, never tiring and the dark horde, <br />
made not one inch of ground. <br />
<br />
'Give in... give up... surrender... become part o the darkness... then she shall become part <br />
of the darkness... then you shall be together forever... so says  three witches of beautiful <br />
anarchy: Golgatha, Gomorrah, and Gaal. Let it all go. You've already set one foot to <br />
become part of it all... take the second step... let it all go... so says Golgatha, Gomorrah, <br />
and Gaal.' <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't... I DIDN'T BECOME PENNY TO LET GO OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN! I <br />
became this way to save Katie and to make sure what happened to her doesn't have to <br />
happen to anyone ever ever ever EVER AGAIN!&quot; <br />
<br />
Penny did a horizontal slash with her sword, cutting the attack blob of darkness in two, <br />
forcing it into a retreat. <br />
<br />
According to the opinions of many who experience it, love is not a singular feeling or <br />
emotion, and comes in many different shades and dimensions.  there is love between <br />
friends and teammates, love between family, romantic love, and love for one's God and <br />
one's people, and each of these has as much right to be called 'love' as the other three. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
While the other she-wolves had been given womanhood of various sizes playing to both <br />
Kaylee and Jensen's perverted sides, the bust lines of the statues had been, and in fact had <br />
been intended to be nothing short of silly even when compared to the bouncy Amethyst!! <br />
<br />
Kaylee had said the term in pop culture was 'gag boobs' used as a satire on absurd bust <br />
sizes used in other popular works. <br />
<br />
Julie had commented and her sisters had of course nodded thinking her logic as they had <br />
been made to think the same, &quot;I think we're going to have to eventually place the four <br />
orientals over the knife for breast reduction. Things that size are going to get in the way <br />
nearly any ordinary house hold duty. I'm surprised really, oriental people weren't known <br />
for such absurd sizes...&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee had said before they had left, &quot;That has to do totally with the wording of the <br />
Transform used.&quot; <br />
<br />
The new japanese wolves had heard none of this as the triplets had whispered carefully to <br />
their Alpha Female to the rear before proceeding. <br />
<br />
Now Julie would see the moment of truth to see if these new wolves created by Amy and <br />
Zelipe would be reborn into the pack with similar oversized disabling breasts the size of <br />
beach balls.  How they were managing to stand up at all and move as quickly as they did <br />
was a medical mystery to Julie. <br />
<br />
It also took her mind off the strange feeling of guilt and shame she felt... she had hurt a <br />
cop, naw, a teammate. She felt a nagging feeling of guilt and shame for Darla and Fran felt <br />
a persistence of those emotions.  While Darla and Fran had turned in their badges as Frank <br />
and Daryl, the bound between them and their fellow cops remained. And now they had <br />
broken a sacred pact, it almost felt like they had attacked a PACKMATE almost! <br />
<br />
All triplets thought the same thought, 'As soon as we're done here and gone from this <br />
room the better.' <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
'I am a statue. Just a pretty statue. that's all I am. That's all I shall ever be, that's all I have <br />
ever been. Eternal art. Eternal beauty. I am pretty, I am beautiful. I am art. All humans <br />
shall age and die, but I shall be eternal and beautiful and loved by all and remembered by <br />
all, all through the ages... '<br />
<br />
'Katie... I love you...'<br />
<br />
'Katie? Whose that? I'm 'Woman Laying Back Waiting' that is my title, that is my name, that <br />
is who I am, that is what I am, that is all I am, all I have ever been, all I shall ever be. Katie <br />
is.... Katie is... someone who... somehow... someway... somewhere... she is... walking <br />
down a park with a lanky young man talking about becoming a 'martial arts guy, like in <br />
Karate Kid?'  Huh?  An ordinary looking man asks her an odd question? She answers. He <br />
tells me to ask him a simplistic question after posing a certain way and smiling? ... She <br />
hears the man she was with screaming? She is... she... she does... she can... she... loves <br />
him too?' <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes later, Penny faintly heard someone tearing the expensive curtain down <br />
from the room's barred window... she felt someone warp them around the ruined knee, <br />
she felt them finally stop the bleeding.. damn why did it have to be so cold? <br />
<br />
She heard something, a deep gruff voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;The rest of you spread out and see if you can find anyone else who got left behind... I <br />
doubt it but it's worth a try... I'll call the police and get some help for her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right Kirk!&quot; She heard a number of female voices replying, something of their tone <br />
sounding familiar, but knowning she hadn't heard them back at the station with her pride <br />
but... she smiled lions, like her, one was male, and others were female. <br />
<br />
&quot;Penny! PENNY! Can you hear me! It's me! Please hold on! Just hold on! I promise you'll get <br />
help soon! I promise!&quot; <br />
<br />
Penny stirred awake, that voice, she had never heard it before, but why.. why was it <br />
familiar? She didn't smell the wolves anymore who had handed her butt to her but... this <br />
new smell, it made her relaxed, at peace, safe... she knew she could trust who was <br />
speaking, help would be here soon. <br />
<br />
She struggled her eyes open... she saw large pale beige shape with a gold mane <br />
shadowing over her. &quot;K-kat-tieeee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not.. not quite... I'm here Penny... I promise... we aren't separating again...&quot; She felt two <br />
big strong arms embrace her and.. it felt so.. it felt so RIGHT to be in those arms... <br />
<br />
&quot;KIRK! We can't find any of the others... I think the curator either moved them, or the <br />
wolves got them.&quot; Said another the female voices. <br />
<br />
&quot;I should have known... Arael, find the curator, make sure he's okay, he took very good <br />
care of us and spoke to us, we owe him. Armisael, call the police. Gabriel, cover up or <br />
smash every damn mirror you can find. Mal'akh... help me keep Penny awake.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Four female voices responded.</p>
