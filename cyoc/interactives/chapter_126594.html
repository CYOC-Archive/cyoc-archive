<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Beta pulled his new massive frame off of Alpha&#39;s dick. He glanced back and smiled as his tail wagged back at him. He sighed, smiled, and looked around the room with satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Kevin&#39;s sense of self came rushing back and hit him like a freight train. He stared in shocked amazement of the scene that lay before him. The former dog Reginald was now a massive muscular and beefy hunk of a man that went by the name Alpha. He sat up and stared with a smile at Kevin. Kevin couldn&#39;t help but blush. It was then that he noticed Alpha&#39;s wagging tail behind him. He glanced down at his own body and saw that it was extremely similar to Alpha&#39;s or Reginald&#39;s, who knows anymore? Bitch, no, Mitch was a whimpering mess. His clothes had been torn. Gone was his muscular stature. His body was now that of a lithe anthropomorphic dog. Tom and Drew had no physical changes. But for some reason, they kept leaping up onto their legs before falling back down to the floor.<br />
<br />
Noticing the questioning look, Tom exclaimed, &quot;We&#39;re trying to stand up! But we can&#39;t do it! It&#39;s like something is preventing us from doing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woof!&quot; Drew barked. That surprised Kevin. &quot;Woof! Woof!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t he talk?&quot; Kevin asked, his voice was deeper but not a deep rumble like...the man&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably the same reason why we both can&#39;t stand?&quot; Tom suggested. &quot;It&#39;s like I want to do it, but a voice inside of me is telling me that I shouldn&#39;t, that I&#39;m not allowed to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may stand and speak,&quot; came Reginald&#39;s deep voice. Kevin shook his head to shake the shivers that traveled up and down his spine and straight to his dick. Tom looked at Reginald for a moment before trying to stand again. This time he was successful and didn&#39;t fall over. They all looked at Drew in expectation. Drew was likewise successful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; he said tentatively. He was elated and then got cross. &quot;What the FUCK was all of that?&quot; He looked at Mitch. &quot;Jesus, Mitch. Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mitch looked up at Drew. &quot;Am I okay? AM I OKAY? I&#39;M HALF-HUMAN HALF-DOG FOR GOD&#39;S SAKE! I wanted Reginald to FUCK me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We all did,&quot; Tom said. He looked over to the former dog turned human. &quot;Reginald, what did you do to us and why is it that when you said to stand, Drew and I suddenly could?&quot;<br />
<br />
Reginald scratched his head with his hand and replied, &quot;I don&#39;t know how this happened. And call me Reg for now. I&#39;m still trying to make sense of suddenly becoming human. As for your actions, well, I think they can be easily explained.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt that,&quot; Tom said. &quot;I doubt all of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reg frowned. &quot;You&#39;re certainly allowed to do that. But perhaps I should show you the last bit.&quot; He paused, waiting for a response. When none came, Reg continued, &quot;Tom, give me your shirt.&quot; Without hesitation, Tom handed the shirt to Reg. &quot;How did that make you feel, doing what I asked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...good, actually,&quot; Tom said. &quot;It made me feel good. But what do you need my shirt for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t need it,&quot; Reg said, dropping the shirt. &quot;Tom, I&#39;ve got some of Kevin&#39;s cum on me. Lick me clean.&quot; To everyone&#39;s surprise, Tom crossed the short distance to Reg, knelt down next to him, and began using his tongue to clean Reg&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Kevin asked. &quot;Why is Tom doing that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom, knock it off!&quot; Drew said. But Tom ignored what Drew said. It was almost as if he didn&#39;t hear Drew at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reg, please, tell him to stop,&quot; Kevin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re starting to figure it out,&quot; Reg said with a smile. The praise felt good coming from Reg for Kevin. &quot;Now, Kevin, you try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin felt an overwhelming urge to do as Reg said. He looked at Drew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kevin, please don&#39;t.&quot; Drew said nervously. &quot;I won&#39;t do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately that gave Kevin an idea and he had to try it. Kevin told Drew, &quot;Drew, lick up all of the cum off the floor...and enjoy it.&quot; He added the last part out of curiosity. Sure enough, Drew stooped down and started licking up the cum that he, Mitch, and Tom had spewed across the wooden floorboards. Invigorated by this newfound power of control, he turned to Mitch. &quot;Mitch, break up with your girlfriend over the phone.&quot; The look of horror in Mitch&#39;s eyes faded out immediately. He stood up and walked awkwardly upstairs to find his cellphone. The swishing tail behind him left Kevin with an uneasy feeling of arousal. He looked to Tom. &quot;Tom, stop licking Reg.&quot; But Tom ignored Kevin. Kevin was confused. Why hadn&#39;t it worked? And why were the other two following his orders to the letter?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the alpha,&quot; Reg said, answering Kevin&#39;s unasked question. &quot;You are the beta. With this pack, what I say trumps what you say. You can order them all around so long as they aren&#39;t disobeying my orders. And you obey my commands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pack?&quot; Kevin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would seem that whatever has caused all of these changes has bound us together as a pack, with me as the alpha and you as the beta. Why it was you, I have no idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For someone who was just a dog, you seem to be really intelligent,&quot; Kevin pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not complaining,&quot; Reg said. &quot;Whatever kind of weird magic this is gifted me with heightened intelligence.&quot; Mitch came back downstairs at the same time Drew and Tom stopped lapping up the cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you make me do that?&quot; Tom asked Reg with a frown. He backed away quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you make me break up with my girlfriend?&quot; Mitch asked. &quot;She&#39;s now bawling her eyes out. And I hung up on her. She&#39;s going to be here soon, knowing her. How do I explain this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, calm down,&quot; Kevin said. He glanced at Drew. &quot;You seem alright with what you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You told me to enjoy it, so I did,&quot; Drew replied. &quot;I enjoyed licking cum off of the floor. I hate the taste of it, and I think doing it anywhere else is nasty. But I really liked doing it off of the floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus,&quot; Tom said. &quot;And why is it that Kevin is the beta?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because he&#39;s the second hottest guy here,&quot; Mitch grunted, unable to help himself. Everyone looked at him. &quot;I&#39;m still horny, alright? I&#39;m a bitch in heat right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess that explains why we&#39;re all still hard as a rock,&quot; Kevin thought to himself. He did notice, though, that Reg was eyeing Mitch with increasing interest. The heat in the room was starting to rise again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, we all want to get fucked by Reg right now,&quot; Tom pointed out. &quot;But why am I also feeling like that towards Kevin?&quot; That question seemed to send an electric charge straight to Kevin&#39;s dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to fuck you, Tom?&quot; Kevin asked. &quot;Answer me truthfully.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god,&quot; Tom moaned. &quot;Honestly, yes I do. But I want to get to the bottom of this before then, okay? Please?&quot;</p>
