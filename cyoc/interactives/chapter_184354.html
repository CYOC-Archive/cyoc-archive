<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Queen lay on her side, her young prince&#39;s mouth wrapped tightly around her dark nipple as milk flowed into his hungry belly, the queen sighed and cupped the back of his head, running her thumb through his thin line of hair.<br />
<br />
She felt as if the void of finding a purpose had been filled, she had her son now, and he needed her, with her Prince she would concour not only the fey world, but the world of man as well she thought with a light chuckle.<br />
<br />
Then a blinding pain hit her skull, like a hot iron had just been slamed into her head, the queen held her son close to her chest and looked around the room, no one was there.<br />
<br />
Then it hit again, and the queen&#39;s arm began of its own accord mutch to the queen&#39;s fear and confusion, before she gazed into a nearby mirror,  to see her hair had turned a fire like red with bright green eyes, but upon checking her hair it was still as black as the midnight sky.<br />
<br />
Then the reflection spoke, well not spoke directly, more like it mouthed the words and its voice flooded the queen&#39;s mind &quot;you would turn on your own my queen?, do you have no shame?, I was to be the one to rase that child!&quot; Came Linda&#39;s voice, but the queen only chuckled, holding her Prince gently to her breast.<br />
<br />
&quot;your a resilient one, even without a physical form you find a way to torment and anoy me Linda, but you are mistaken, you see I am this young boys mother now, and with his help, I will become the ruler of this land and any other land I see fit&quot; said the Queen, gazing at the baby in her arms with admiration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well see about that&quot; said Linda before once again taking controll of the queen&#39;s arm and scooping up the baby, and then taking controll of the queen&#39;s entire body.<br />
<br />
Well almost, only the queen&#39;s head was out of her control, but it didn&#39;t matter, even if this took everything she had left, she would find a way to reduce her baby&#39;s magic as much as she could, unfortunately she could only see one way, as Linda used all her remaining power to cast her spell with the queen&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you will never use him, you will be forced to carry him for all time, never getting older, I curse you queen of the fey folke, I curse you&quot; said Linda as her voice faded out, the queen though nothing of it, a weak witch like Linda?, cursing someone as powerful as her?, it was probably a last ditch effort to scare her though the queen with a chuckle as she looked down to see her Prince.<br />
<br />
Only there was no Prince in her arms, her arms were empty, she frantically looked around the bed for him, but then a tightness in her abdomen caused her to buckle over and groan in pain, her heartbeat accelerated and her stomach had a new weight to it.<br />
<br />
Fearing what Linda had done to her, the queen lay on her back gazing at her tightening stomach past the peaks of her enormous milk jugs, only to see a small bulge resting in her pelvis, curious, the queen placed her hand atop the small bump, to find it solid, and warm.<br />
<br />
As her bump suddenly lurched forward into a slight curve, it slowly began to click with the queen what had happened, where her Prince had gone, and what Linda had cursed her with.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...nonono....NO!, my Prince what has she done to us, oh my baby...why did she have to do this to you&quot; sobbed the queen as she places her hands on her swelling belly, now sitting cross-legged with her growing belly now resting in her lap, sobbing as she held her maternal swell.<br />
<br />
Yes, she was now pregnant, pregnant with her Prince, pregnant forever, her Prince would never get to see his mother, she would never again be able to feed him, she would never see him walk, or say his first words, but what she feared the most... was that she would never give birth to him!.<br />
<br />
Theis thoughts flew through her mind as her belly continued to swell, now looking six months along, her skin around her growing womb was tight as a drum, her belly button begging to pop with the pressure within, then her Prince began kicking, his feet visible across her skin.<br />
<br />
The Queen moaned loudly her legs now forced apart by her belly, leaving her now sensitive folds open and vulnerable as the Queen gripped her swelling womb, feeling her Prince kicks and move within, a sense of heat in her nethers causing her cheeks to flush red, and her breathing became laboured and hot as she rubbed over her belly, now feeling immense plesure from each of her sons kicks.<br />
<br />
By the time she had reached the nine month mark she was a hot mess, her tongue hung out to the side and her eyes were rolled back, one hand cupped her large gravid swell and the other clutched the top &quot;there you go baby....nice and big, and round for mommy, good boy&quot; cooed the queen as she sat up and attempted to compose herself, feeling her son lazily roll over, sending her belly slightly lopsided.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well get comfortable baby...because we&#39;re going to be like this..nghh until the end of time&quot; sighed the queen as she heaved herself up, looking at her new figure in the full length mirror, turning to her side and tracing her finger from the top to the underside of her swolen womb.<br />
<br />
Blushing at how she looked, she looked like a pregnant concubine, rather than an expecting queen, and to be honest she didn&#39;t really care, after all, the council had waited long enough for her to create their portals home &quot;well baby, let&#39;s give them a send-off they will never forget&quot;</p>
