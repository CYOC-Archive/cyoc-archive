<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Promise you won’t use this on me again without asking.&quot; Tim said as he watches Jacob changed his sister’s room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Deal and the same to you.&quot; Jacob said smiling as he finished his last change. <br />
<br />
&quot;What now?&quot; Tim asked wondering if he could a chance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ourselves.&quot; Jacob said with a grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you got in mind?&quot; Tim asked a little worried. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sleep-over.&quot; Jacob said a bigger grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;How old?&quot; Tim asked <br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t know. Ten sound good.&quot; Jacob wondering if 10-year old boys have sleep-over. <br />
<br />
&quot;Little old. How about seven.&quot; Tim said as he thought about an old sleep-over he had over here once. <br />
<br />
&quot;OK. As long we are older than my sister. She uses to play with dolls a lot when she was younger. I think if we were too young she have us in doll’s clothes.&quot; Jacob said as he remembers the time his sisters force him into toddler’s pj when he was a kid. <br />
<br />
Making sure he hit the aware option. Jacob selected himself and then Tim. <br />
<br />
It was funny thing to be eye level with the computer’s monitor then being eye level with keyboard in under a second. His hands were moved now sticking almost straight out and up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool.&quot; A 7-year-old Timmy said as he watches his friend Jake becomes the same age as him in a quick blink of an eye. <br />
<br />
&quot;Better save it.&quot; Timmy said before Jake jumps down from his seat. <br />
<br />
&quot;OK.&quot; Jake said in higher pitch voice he was not use too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, look at your closet!&quot; Timmy said as he looks around still getting use to his body. <br />
<br />
In the closet were now clothes and toys for 7-years-old boys and their bags had changed also. <br />
<br />
&quot;Game does not have any options for the closet, just a box that says ‘Closet.'&quot; Jake as he looks from the closet to the computer screen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Better save it and shut off the computer. You still need to ask your mom.&quot; Timmy said little worry. Tim was little smaller than he remembers. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right.&quot; Jake said then saving it and shutting the computer off. <br />
<br />
Pressing the lever under his chair it went down slowly till his feet could touch the floor again. <br />
<br />
They both left the room and went to kitchen to find Jake’s mother. Jake was a little nervous as he went up to his mother. She was a lot bigger in size now. He felt smaller than ever as he spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy, Can Timmy spend the night?&quot; Jake said trying to sound like a little boy would. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, if his parents say yes. I give them call.&quot; His mother said then going from the stove to the phone. <br />
<br />
A short conversation and she hung up. <br />
<br />
&quot;They said yes.&quot; She said then went back to stove. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dinner is almost ready. Go wash up.&quot; She orders as she stirred the chicken dumplings. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, mommy.&quot; Jake said making sure to sound polite. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on&quot; he said to Timmy who was waiting for him in the doorway. After a quick wash that was difficult due to their height they managed to wash each of hands' one at a time. Then drying them on a nearby towel. <br />
<br />
As they let they pass Jake’s sister Mandy as she enters the bathroom. To their surprise she pulled out a plastic step from closet then washed her hands. <br />
<br />
Dinner was fast. None of children spoke much as they ate. They only talked to reply to their parent’s question about school and friends. <br />
<br />
Timmy and Jake did not eat as much they would have. Smaller stomachs and excitement combine they ate small portions of their food. <br />
<br />
After they ate and put away their dishes in the sink. Everyone went into the living to watch TV. They watched a few shows on cable channels. Mostly cartoons for the children to watch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bath Time.&quot; Jake‘s mother said after two hours passed. <br />
<br />
Looking at all the children. They followed her up the stairs into the bathroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;don't mind if you take a bath with Jake and Mandy?&quot; Jake’s mothers ask Timmy as they enter. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Timmy said not very sure of himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. You all can go play sooner, if you all get your bath at the same time.&quot; She explains. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead get undress.&quot; She said she started to strip off the clothes on Mandy. <br />
<br />
Jake was too busy taking off his clothes to notice how slowly Tim was taken his clothes off. Both boys were hesitate to take off their underwear, but did it anyway. Mandy was already setting the tub and water was halfway up now. Providing her cover for her lower body. <br />
<br />
Jake and Tim got in too so they get the same cover. They spent the next 30 minutes acting as little boys as they play with Mandy and pretend to play with toy boats Jake’s mother had gotten out of the closet for them. <br />
<br />
Jake notices that Mandy would stare at Tim from time to time with a funny look in her eyes. Then it dawns on him that she had a crush on Tim. When their hands and feet were wrinkle. Jake’s mothers announce it was time for them to get out. <br />
<br />
Mandy got out first as her mother lifted her out with a towel then wrapping it around her body. She then handed a towel to each boy as they got out of the tub. Each of them wraps the towels around their waist quickly to hide themselves. <br />
<br />
Mother went with Mandy into her room to help her dress as the boys went to Jake’s room to get ready for bed. They dress quickly not wanting to the be embarrass any further. Timmy borrows few clothes from Jake for this Friday’s night sleep-over. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on down stairs when you finish dressing.&quot; Jake heard his Mother just outside the door. She was now the boss and neither boys dare to disobey her. She was so much bigger than stronger than they were. <br />
<br />
Both boys obeyed and went down the stairs then into the living room to find two sleeping bags for them on the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;You all can stay up for one more hour before you must go to sleep.&quot; She said nicely then left up the stairs. <br />
<br />
The boys watched two more cartoon shows that were more to what they liked then before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nearly 10:00 o’clock. We better to the bed.&quot; Timmy said just as the credits were ending on their last cartoon. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I don’t want to be spank.&quot; Jake said looking toward the stairs. <br />
<br />
Boys spent another twenty minute lying the darkness lightly chatting to each other before they drifted off to sleep.</p>
