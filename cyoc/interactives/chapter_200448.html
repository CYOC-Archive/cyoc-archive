<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arthur and Drew spent the morning making moulds of their temporary genitals with the dildo kits while they waited for the Wishing Games to start. Arthur was not-so-secretly excited to eventually have a dildo copy of his dad’s and uncle’s penises. They would definitely be fun after the boys transformed back. <br />
<br />
The Wishing Games were a series of short 1 v 1 competitions which allowed any winner to make one wish which would transform their temporary vacation bodies. One’s wish could even incorporate another person, as long as it didn’t involve the wisher’s original body.<br />
<br />
Arthur wanted to win at least one game to transform his uncle Frank body in a way that would cause Frank further embarrassment/emasculation. He could always give himself a vagina. With a cunt on his front he could hoax more male family members/guests to fuck him, and his uncle would certainly be mortified. The thing was, Arthur didn’t really want a vagina. Sure, he could probably close his eyes and let the men have at it, but he liked having a penis and the fact that he ended up in a male body this year.<br />
<br />
He could always get rid of his uncle’s manly body hair, shorten his penis length, or maybe reduce his muscle down to a small amount. He was still mulling over his options, but it was time for the games to start. He and Drew mailed out the dildo moulds and moved to the conference room.<br />
<br />
Since different bodies and minds had advantages and disadvantages, the types of contests and their participants were decided at random. There were arm wrestling, trivia quizlet, archery, and many many more contests.<br />
<br />
Arthur lucked out by getting a contest that played to his uncle’s body advance. A tug of war would be a walk in the park with his large muscles. To make matters easier, his opponent ended up being some guy in an old woman’s body. He made quick work of the contest and headed to one of the wishing booths linked to the wishing crystal.<br />
<br />
“Here goes nothing,” said Arthur. Finally he was sure about what transformation to go with. All he had to do was close his eyes and focus on what he wanted.<br />
<br />
When he opened his eyes his bizarre wish had come true. His body no longer had limbs, except the most fun one of course. Just the thought that men could touch him and fuck him as they pleased while he had no limbs to stop them was arousing. His dick stirred and leaked in the nylon rainbow thong that was the only thing he wore to the Wishing Games. Though it wasn’t unusual to wear only underwear at this event.<br />
<br />
“Uh, a little help here!” Arthur shouted from in the booth. Some volunteer staff carried him out and put him in a wheelchair, but they had to get back to work, leaving him in a chair which he had no arms to man.<br />
<br />
Arthur kept looking out for Drew. Little did he know, Drew had already won his own match, and was in a booth spending his wish on Arthur. He knew that Arthur wanted to get fucked by lots more men on this vacation, so he wished that Arthur’s body would produce a magical pheromone which would make men go wild for him.<br />
<br />
One of the volunteers turned his head towards Arthur and started looking at him differently than he had before. He seemed to be no older than 18, but he probably had the consciousness of an older man in that slender body. He was sizing up Arthur’s limbless body which now smelled impossibly good to him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the man came up behind the wheelchair and started wheeling Arthur out of the conference room.<br />
<br />
“Um, hi? Where are we going?” Asked Arthur reasonably. He would’ve freaked out, but this guy’s vacation body was kinda cute. It was a young blond guy with little fat and a slight build. He had a little peach fuzz beard and mustache that looked simultaneously goofy and hot.<br />
<br />
“Uhh..someone wanted to meet with you in the men’s lobby,” said the man sweating. It felt like a lie.<br />
<br />
“You mean my boyfriend Drew?” Asked Arthur.<br />
<br />
“Yeah yeah, that’s the one,” said the man, adjusting a boner in his pants as he continued to wheel Arthur. Other men were turning their heads to check out Arthur, which he just attributed to being limbless.<br />
<br />
The man in the young body wheeled him into a room suite and said, “I’m so sorry, I don’t know why but I can’t help myself.”<br />
<br />
“Uh this isn’t the men’s lobby,” said Arthur, but then he realized what this man was up to when he started rubbing his hands up and down Arthur’s limbless body.<br />
<br />
The mystery man lifted Arthur onto the bed in the suite and said, “I know. I’m Paul and I know this is gonna sound crazy but I NEED to breed you. This is so wrong, I’m straight, I’ve never been attracted to a man in my life. But it’s the way you smell or something, it’s making your body more attractive to me. Impossibly attractive. And when I saw that you had no arms or legs, I knew that I could overpower you even in this string bean body.”<br />
<br />
Paul stripped down to his tighty whities and then removed Arthur’s thong with ease. Paul’s borrowed body was so smooth and had cute pink little nipples. He was entranced with Arthur’s penis, he’d never seen someone’s manhood this upclose and personal. And he’d certainly never wanted to touch one...or suck one, until now. <br />
<br />
Paul began to suck the cock before him clumsily and put his hands down his own briefs, feeling his new 18 year old body’s small dick for the first time. He had looked at his vacation body in the mirror naked once when he first swapped, but thought there was no way he was going to land a lady while in this body due to the small dick and skinny body, so he had given up on exploring this body sexually. Now Paul had someone to receive his small member whether that person wanted to or not.<br />
<br />
“Jeez, I don’t know whether to fuck your ass or put this thing inside me,” said Paul about the cock he just pulled out of his mouth. Arthur hadn’t even considered that this man might forcibly bottom on him. That thought was equally enticing as getting fucked.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna have to go with your ass because it’s gonna be hard enough to sleep tonight after having sex with a man. I can’t believe I’m actually gonna get a chance to use this little thing though. I swear this kid was too young and lied in order to be in the adult swap category or something” said Paul, giving Arthur’s five inch erection a few slaps with his own four incher. Arthur moaned and his dick spasmed.<br />
<br />
Arthur suddenly felt cold lube on his hairy butthole. Soon, the possibly 18 year old cock was buried all four inches deep. It wasn’t a lot, but it was enough to hit Arthur’s prostate, and being taken without permission was making it even hotter. Paul jackrabbited Arthur’s hole while teasing his nipples on his hairy pecs. He bent over and started sucking those nipples too.<br />
<br />
After an hour of being pumped, Arthur started cumming hands free. Of course, he had no hands now. Seeing his handiwork made Paul lose his load into Arthur’s ass as well, while he moaned like the virgin his new body was.</p>
