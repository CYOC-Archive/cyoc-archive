<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah paced back and forth in the police station&#39;s lobby with worry. When her mom last saw her, she was a normal 14 year old girl. Now she was going to see her as an anthro Husky with an adult and muscular build. Would she even recognize her? Would she think Sarah was a reckless delinquent who threw away both her humanity and her childhood? Would she outright call her a freak and disown her?<br />
<br />
Malice put a hand on her adopted sister&#39;s shoulder and said, &quot;It&#39;ll be alright. Mom won&#39;t hate us. If nothing else, you&#39;ll always have me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah smiled and said, &quot;Thanks, I hope you&#39;re right.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them waited for what seemed like a very long time before the front doors opened. A very worried Mrs. Wesley walked in with Farmer Brown and his wife right behind her. Julia looked around in worry and confusion, seeming to not notice the sisters at first before she focused on them. Mrs. Wesley stared in confusion for a few moments. The call she got said that Sarah had got infected by Mary Alice, but instead of two Husky girls in teenagers&#39; clothes, she saw a pair of Husky women wearing police uniforms. Both of them were taller than her and were well-built in both muscles and curves. She looked between the two of them, not sure how to tell them apart at first. But then she noticed that one of the Husky women had long black hair on her head like a human&#39;s and instead of having icy blue eyes like the other, her eyes were brown. She had seen those eyes for over 14 years. &quot;S-Sarah?&quot; she asked, not sure if she wanted to believe it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mom,&quot; said the brown-eyed Husky. Her voice was a little deeper, but there was no doubt it was Sarah&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...what...how did this happen?&quot; asked Mrs. Wesley, &quot;You should be so...big. Neither of you should be!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as you may recall, I did say that Mary Alice did have a secondary exposure to the virus,&quot; said Shelly.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Wesley stared at Shelly. &quot;You&#39;re a wolf...&quot; she said numbly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I was born a wolf until I got exposed myself,&quot; said Shelly patiently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is a policewoman a wolf?&quot; asked Mrs. Wesley in the same numb voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we&#39;re the most suited to act as police force here,&quot; said Shelly, &quot;Our pack instinct of protection and discipline makes us rather effective. Not that there&#39;s been much reason to have a police force so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Wesley blinked and said, &quot;But what does Mary Alice&#39;s second exposure have to do with anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because the original virus was supposed to promote fertility,&quot; said Farmer Brown, &quot;Usually, an animal or human will just become a fit anthro version of themselves. But if they get a second exposure, usually from someone in a different age group from them, they&#39;ll mature or youthen until they&#39;re in their prime. That&#39;s what happened to Abigail when she and Samson-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; snapped Mrs. Wesley before turning to Sarah and Malice, &quot;You two didn&#39;t have sex, did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, Mom, how could you even think that!&quot; yelped Sarah, feeling her face heat up at the accusation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing like that happened,&quot; protested Malice, &quot;I just drank some milk from some uplifted cows. From the canisters they put it in, not directly from the cows themselves. I didn&#39;t know it would make me bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then Malice found me while I saw talking with Abby and Sam while we were talking about me joining Animalia,&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you did this on purpose?&quot; asked Mrs. Wesley in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it was an actual accident,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;Malice was willing, but she wouldn&#39;t have done it without my permission. She was just happy enough to call me her sister. I was touched and I walked over to hug her when I tripped and kinda fell...onto her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Onto these, more precisely,&quot; said Malice as she hefted up her breasts, which were easily outline even in the blue shirt she was wearing.<br />
<br />
Sarah elbowed her and hissed, &quot;Not now.&quot; She turned back to her mom and said, &quot;Well, I kinda got a little taste of her milk and it was so tasty that I could help but drink it. I didn&#39;t even try to stop after I fully change into a Husky and I, well, grew up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Wesley looked like she was about to fall over from the shock. &quot;There, there, it&#39;s not as bad as it seems,&quot; said Mrs. Brown as she guided Mrs. Wesley to a chair, &quot;They&#39;re both perfectly find if a bit altered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit altered?&quot; asked Mrs. Wesley, &quot;My daughter&#39;s a full grown dog-woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There could be worse ways she could have been changed and worse things to be changed into,&quot; said Farmer Brown, &quot;But the face is, Julia, that it&#39;s happened and she&#39;s likely to be that way for the rest of her life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Wesley stared numbly at him and Sarah gave a whine of worry. &quot;Mom, please don&#39;t be mad at me or Malice. It was a real accident. I&#39;m still the same me inside. Please don&#39;t leave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Wesley looked at Sarah and said, &quot;I couldn&#39;t leave you. You&#39;re my daughter, even if you are...changed. But all this... I&#39;m not even sure what to think. What am I going to tell your father?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell him the truth,&quot; said Mrs. Brown simply, &quot;There&#39;s no point in keeping it secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Mom, don&#39;t break up the family,&quot; pleased Malice.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Wesley stared at her and said, &quot;You called me &#39;mom&#39;.&quot; She turned to Sarah and said, &quot;And you called her &#39;Malice&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, &#39;Mary Alice&#39; is such a mouthful,&quot; said Malice, &quot;I just like &#39;Malice&#39; more, but you can still call me &#39;Mary Alice&#39; if you want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I do...&quot; said Mrs. Wesley distantly before sighing and saying, &quot;Look, I&#39;m not about to abandon either of you, but this is too much to take in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be fine,&quot; said Mrs. Brown, &quot;Just give it time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope it will,&quot; said Mrs. Wesley. Sarah just gave a sigh. Her mom wasn&#39;t giddy about this (which would be really weird if she was), but she wasn&#39;t about to disown either her or Malice. Hopefully when the shock wears off, she&#39;ll be a lot more accepting of the situation.</p>
