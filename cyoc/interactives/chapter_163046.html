<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You have always acknowledged that you find men more appealing, but there was something about being in a female that allured you. Perhaps it was the new sensation of arousal or the boosted self-esteem despite being just as thin and smooth-textured. Either way, you felt that you haven&#39;t gotten the whole female experience just yet. Closing your eyes and recalling all those sensations in Eliza&#39;s body, you pray that this attempt would work.<br />
<br />
When you opened your eyes, you saw that...you were still in a bathroom. However, you quickly realized that it wasn&#39;t the one you were in before. It smelled..more fragrant. You looked down at yourself to see that you were adorned in same blue blazer you were in before, along with those noticeable protrusions on your chest. Your body was slightly bent down towards the toilet seat as you saw your right hand holding a wad of toilet paper. Looking further down, you discovered that your lower half was partially undressed with a cool feeling as you noticed a significant wet spot in the pink panties. You blushed as you realized that you probably went in Eliza&#39;s body just as she was cleaning up. Dabbing the last bit of drops in your crotch, you threw the toilet paper in the bowl when you&#39;re done. Your crotch felt very sensitive, but you resisted the urge to explore at the moment, remembering your past mistake. In an effort to divert your attention, you pulled up the panties and pantyhose, noticing that they were soaked quite a bit. Despite the unsavory nature, the cool, wet touch felt great as it lined your current folds. &quot;No, can&#39;t be distracted now. Stay strong, Mark. You wanted to look at the aspects of a mature life,&quot; you thought as you quickly pulled down the black skirt sitting at your waist. Sadly, the skirt only went mid-thigh, so you still felt significant air drafts wafting between your legs. <br />
<br />
Stepping out into the stall, you saw your new appearance for the first time in a mirror. Provided, it wasn&#39;t your first time seeing Eliza, but you stood astounded nonetheless, knowing that this was now your appearance. Your hair was tied up in a ponytail, your eyes presented a hazel flare, your face own a familiar smooth texture. Similar to your own body, your current body was slim, but it also had pronounced curves and those chest bumps. Surprisingly, the boobs don&#39;t stand out in the mirror as much as they feel. Despite inhabiting Eliza&#39;s body a second time, you still couldn&#39;t believe you had her form, as you contorted Eliza&#39;s expressions under your command, from a cheeky smile to a sad frown and even a silly face. The same smooth and thin texture that you had before, and yet you felt less ashamed and more comfortable about it. <br />
<br />
A female student entered the restroom, and judging by her looks, she was most likely a freshman. Realizing it wasn&#39;t someone you know, you quickly washed your hands. As you headed out, you thought you heard the girl whisper if you had an accident, noticing that she was probably referring to your wet stain in the back of your skirt. As much as you wanted to deny vocally, you knew that it would be mature to just ignore it at the moment, as you try to act the part. <br />
<br />
Looking around the hallway to understand your location, you then turned toward Eliza&#39;s classroom. When you entered, you breathed a sigh of relief that the room was empty, meaning you didn&#39;t have to deal with any issues or potential embarrassments at the moment. However, you did notice a small puddle laying at the foot of the teacher&#39;s chair, and you had a hunch of what it was. Grabbing some tissue, you crouched down to wipe away the puddle. Just as you finish, you heard the door open, and you saw one of your previous teachers, Mrs. Jones, enter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eliza, how was your first month as a teacher been so far?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Jumping in surprise, you quickly turned around to block her view of any signs of your accident and replied hastily, &quot;Yea. It&#39;s going fine so far. The students are very diligent in their work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great to hear! I&#39;m glad you are slowly getting comfortable ever since you joined our staff. You look very different than before, when you were very nervous. I was surprised that you didn&#39;t really ask us facility for any help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, I see that Eliza takes her job with a lot of pride,&quot; you thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it was hard at first, but I thought I could get over it myself,&quot; you responded with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great! I&#39;m sure you will be fine with the parent-teacher conferences next week! I have to head back to wrap up grading for today. Talk to you later!&quot; Mrs. Jones said as she waved goodbye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, see you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dropping off the tissue in the garbage bin, you took a sigh of relief that you carried out the conversation with Mrs. Jones. You had her as your English teacher your sophomore year, and while you heard that she was a kind old lady at heart, she tended to be strict in class, as you remembered having much difficulty in her assignments. She would reprimand you whenever you failed her assignment. Therefore, you were apprehensive when talking to her just now. But you supposed that Mrs. Jones displayed more of her kindness towards other faculty. It was certainly one of the perks of being a teacher: seeing other sides of other teachers.<br />
<br />
After wiping up the stains on the chair as well, you packed Eliza&#39;s stuff to head back to her office, figuring that she was done for the day. (After all, she spent most of her time grading.) Returning to the office, you greeted the few teachers working at their desks, making sure you never turned your back to them. Finally reaching her desk, you search for any spare clothes around her belongings, as the wetness was getting somewhat distracting for you, especially when you sit down or when you greet someone.</p>
