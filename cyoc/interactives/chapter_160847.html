<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris continued to lie on the bed, struggling to get himself back up again. He was exhausted from the previous night’s action and wished that Michael had just gone back to bed with him. He was also upset, wondering if he had made a big mistake in fucking his boss’ husband in the ass, the way he did just a few minutes before.<br />
<br />
“I have a feeling that the full impact of what I’ve done hasn’t even been felt yet” Chris thought to himself, as he got in a few extra winks.<br />
<br />
Buddy had decided to take a quick nap as well, after playing around with Chris for a while. He tried to cheer his bodyguard up, but knew that the tension remained in the air. <br />
<br />
“I probably shouldn’t have been so eager to prompt them to fuck” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy kept his eyes closed. “I think I was letting my red rocket do the talking for me. The worst part is I didn’t even get a chance to cum, to see if it would turn me back. All that damage to my marriage for nothing. I just hope Michael and I can find a way to work whatever issues arise out. It wasn’t worth it to risk losing him because of Chris’ sexy body.”<br />
<br />
When Michael was done in the shower, he stepped out, covering his waist with a towel. He could see his husband as Buddy and Chris continuing to get some sleep. He thought to wake them, but decided against it. He was still fuming and wanted to stew in his anger privately. Getting dressed, Michael went down to the kitchen to make himself some breakfast.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, the smell of eggs wafted into Buddy’s sensitive nose. Sniffing at it, he whimpered, as he got up and trotted out of the bedroom. Making his way downstairs, Buddy looked up to see Michael scrambling eggs in a pan.<br />
<br />
“I’m making some scrambled eggs” Michael said, as he continued to look at the pan. “It’s ok for dogs to eat these if you’re hungry.”<br />
<br />
Buddy barked once, as he laid down on the floor. Michael finished cooking, before grabbing a plate from the cabinet. He laid the plate in front of Buddy, who happily ate it up with his tongue. Michael cracked more eggs and made a second serving for himself. While he cooked, Buddy made a whimpering noise.<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter?” Michael asked, as he turned to look down at Buddy.<br />
<br />
Buddy motioned his head to the backyard door. He needed to take care of his business right that second, lest he leave some droppings on the floor of their house. He hadn’t gone to the bathroom as a dog since the ring first came back into town. He had only been a dog for an hour, two hours tops, before this recent transformation. Now, having been a dog for close to twelve hours, his natural canine urges began to take over. <br />
<br />
“Can it wait until I’m done?” Michael asked, as he continued to cook. “I’m almost done here.”<br />
<br />
Buddy reluctantly nodded, as Michael finished cooking his meal. When it was done, Michael served himself the scrambled eggs on a plate and sat down at the table to eat them. Buddy whined, as he got up from the floor and nudged himself into Michael’s lap.<br />
<br />
“Hold on a minute” Michael said with an annoyed tone in his voice, as he scarfed down his food. “I don’t want you shitting in the house.”<br />
<br />
Michael wiped his mouth with a napkin and then got up from the chair. He made his way to the backyard door and opened it, watching Buddy trotting outside. <br />
<br />
“You won’t run off if I let you take care of your business privately, will you?” Michael asked. <br />
<br />
Buddy shook his head. <br />
<br />
“Ok. I’ll leave you out here for five minutes or so and then check back on you after that. Sounds good?”<br />
<br />
Buddy nodded his head, as Michael closed the door. Taking in the sights and sounds of the almost early afternoon, Buddy sniffed at the air and smelled his surroundings. The trees smelled refreshing, the faint whiff of a fall barbecue smelled delicious and the scent of their neighbor’s perfume was…blech. He could hear birds chirping and the quiet breeze in the air. He enjoyed this for a moment, before he took care of his business. <br />
<br />
Buddy looked for a spot in the yard to quietly take a dump. He spotted a bush that served his needs. He knew that Michael was meticulous about the garden, but times were urgent. Making a little rattle in the bushes as he plopped himself over there, Buddy pushed out a large shit and then wiped his ass on the grass below him. <br />
<br />
“Shit is still on my ass” Freddy thought to himself when he finished, looking down at his hole to inspect it with his nose. “However, I’m not licking it off, as uncomfortable as it is for it to be stuck on there. Perhaps Michael will clean it off for me later.”<br />
<br />
Feeling the need to pee, Buddy lifted his leg and peed onto the bush. When he was finished, he took one last look at his surroundings, before trotting his way over to the backyard door. Banging at it with his paws, he could hear Michael call out to him clearly from the other side of the door. <br />
<br />
“Finished?” Michael asked.<br />
<br />
Buddy barked once in reply.<br />
<br />
“Coming.”<br />
<br />
Michael opened the door, allowing Buddy to trot back inside. As Michael closed the door behind him, Buddy noticed a bowl of water on the floor. <br />
<br />
“Figured you might be thirsty” Michael noted. <br />
<br />
Buddy nodded, as he bent down and lapped up the water from the bowl. It was refreshing on his tongue and satisfied his thirst. When he was done, Michael bent down and took the plate and bowl and placed it into the sink.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to need to disinfect these now” Michael said with a chuckle. “Don’t want any dog germs on them.”<br />
<br />
Buddy whined, as Michael bent down to scratch him behind the ears. <br />
<br />
“It’s ok, Freddy. We’re going to get ourselves through this. For now, let’s wait for Sofya to get here. Maybe she can be of assistance.”<br />
<br />
Michael got up and went to sit down on the couch in the living room. Buddy joined him soon after and put his head in his lap. A few minutes later, Michael could see Chris coming down the stairs. He was fully cleaned off and dressed in a casual outfit, uncharacteristic when compared to his usual business attire. <br />
<br />
“Mind if I sit with you?” Chris asked reluctantly. <br />
<br />
Michael shrugged, as Chris sat down on the other end of the couch.<br />
<br />
“Can we talk about this?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“No” Michael replied coldly. <br />
<br />
Buddy quietly growled.<br />
<br />
“I really think we should talk about this.”<br />
<br />
“I really think we should focus on the task at hand. Let’s wait for Sofya to get here and see if she can help us break the curse without getting the ring.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you think we should take the opportunity to take it from the mayor now?”<br />
<br />
“The mayor isn’t going to just hand it over to us over. Even if he still has forgotten my husband, like most of the town probably has, he’s not handing it over to us.”<br />
<br />
“We could just take it from him, then.”<br />
<br />
“And get ourselves arrested for theft? No thank you, Chris. It’s bad enough that your dick made a bad decision this morning. I didn’t think your bad judgment extended further than that.”<br />
<br />
“Look, Mr.—“<br />
<br />
“Save it.”<br />
<br />
An awkward silence fell over the room. Chris looked at Michael pleadingly. Michael ignored these glances. He stared into his lap, feeling a sense of anger and sadness wash over him.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, Mr. Scavolini.”<br />
<br />
“What are you sorry for?”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry I pushed myself onto you. Your biggest fear was your husband cheating on you with me and now I went and made you cheat on your husband with me. It was a big mistake and I should have restrained myself. This was totally unprofessional and now it’s making our working relationship harder to maintain.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t wish to dwell over this now, Chris. Let’s just wait for Sofya to get here so we can plan our next line of attack.”<br />
<br />
Chris nodded, as Michael continued to look at his lap. Chris wanted to say or do something in that moment to try to ease the tension, but decided that his best way of helping was to stay silent. He wanted Michael to make the next move. After a time, Buddy got impatient with sitting around and waiting for Sofya. He got up and ran over to the front door, barking as he did so.<br />
<br />
“Is she here?” Michael asked, as he walked over to the front door to look outside. “She’s not here, Freddy. What the hell was that all about?”<br />
<br />
Buddy whimpered, as he motioned his head to the door. <br />
<br />
“What do you want? To go outside?”<br />
<br />
Buddy nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“I don’t think that’s such a good idea, boss” Chris said, as he got up from the couch.<br />
<br />
“He happens to be right about that, Freddy” Michael added with a sigh. “In our home, we have control over you at all times. Once you’re out there, who knows what could happen to you. I really think we should keep you in here until Sofya comes over.”<br />
<br />
Buddy growled, as he jumped on the front door and pawed at it.<br />
<br />
“Down!” Michael ordered, as he struggled to get Buddy to go back onto the floor. <br />
<br />
Buddy growled in his face, which caused Michael to recoil. Whimpering, the dog got back down briefly, before hopping up onto Michael and licking his face. <br />
<br />
“Stop that, Freddy” Michael said, as he squirmed in discomfort. “You know I don’t like it when you do that to me.”<br />
<br />
Buddy hopped down and then went back over to the door.<br />
<br />
“Argh” Michael groaned. “Fine. I’ll let you out for a little walk, but five minutes only and that’s it. We walk once around the block and then we come right back inside. Understand me?”<br />
<br />
Buddy nodded his head.<br />
<br />
“I should probably come with you” Chris insisted.<br />
<br />
“No!”<br />
<br />
Chris recoiled at Michael’s snap. Michael calmed down and composed himself. <br />
<br />
“Sorry” Michael apologized “but someone has to be here in case Sofya stops by. We don’t want her thinking she’s at the wrong address if no one is home to receive her.”<br />
<br />
Chris nodded, as Michael opened the front door. <br />
<br />
“Come on, Freddy” Michael said, as Buddy trotted outside. “One walk around the block and then you’re back inside.”<br />
<br />
Chris closed the door behind them, worried as he did so.<br />
<br />
“I think this is a bad idea” he thought to himself, as he went to sit back on the couch. <br />
<br />
Walking around the block, Buddy happily trotted, making sure he didn’t get too far ahead of Michael. It was great to exercise, seeing as he had so much pent up energy and stress. It was an endorphin release, one that was long overdue. He would have preferred to go to the dog park to run, but knew it would be a bad idea. Keeping a steady pace, he continued his lap around the block.<br />
<br />
They didn’t get too far, before they ran into the worst person, besides the mayor, that they could have seen in that moment. Quietly muttering to himself, Tom stomped down the block in their direction.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck!” Michael shrieked, as he tried to turn around. <br />
<br />
Before he could do so, Tom spotted them and called out to them loudly.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Tom yelled, as he ran towards Michael. “You found my dog, Buddy!”<br />
<br />
“Oh no” Freddy thought to himself, as Michael turned back around to look at Tom.<br />
<br />
“Tom” Michael responded nervously. “Hi.”<br />
<br />
“I’m so glad you found my dog again” Tom said happily, as he bent down to rub Buddy all over his body. “I never thought I’d see you again, boy. Where did you run off to for so many months?”<br />
<br />
“Uh….”<br />
<br />
“Well, regardless, I want to thank you for helping me find my dog.”<br />
<br />
Tom pulled a collar he was holding and placed it around Buddy’s neck. He took out a leash and attached it to the collar. <br />
<br />
“Tom” Michael said nervously. <br />
<br />
“I would pay you for helping me find my dog, but I’m kind of short on cash at the moment. If there’s something I can help you with, I’ll be more than happy to do so.”<br />
<br />
“Uh…”<br />
<br />
“What are you doing, Michael?” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy whimpered at Tom’s aggressive tugs on his leash. “Don’t just stand there. Do something. Get Tom to give me back to you.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think—“<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to say anything, Michael. I really appreciate you helping me out here. You know, for the longest time, I thought you were just a crazy fucking stalker who kept stealing my dog. It turns out that I badly misjudged you. You’re a good guy after all. Thanks for the help. Come on, boy. Let’s get you home.”<br />
<br />
Buddy stood in place, as he looked up at Michael nervously.<br />
<br />
“Do something, you idiot!” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy whined loudly.<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter, boy?” Tom asked, as he bent down the scratch Buddy. <br />
<br />
Buddy ignored Tom&#39;s touch, as he continued to look up at Michael pleadingly. Michael was lost in his thoughts, rapidly trying to figure out a course of action in that moment. On the one hand, he didn’t trust Tom to have Freddy in his possession. The mayor could easily come after them and there’d be no way to protect them. Tom could abuse Freddy, which would be his fault if he allowed it to occur. Tom was also about to move out of the neighborhood. If he didn’t get Buddy back soon, he might be taken away from him forever. That thought alone caused him a lot of hurt.<br />
<br />
However, Michael didn’t think Tom would listen to his reasoning that Freddy was not his dog, Buddy. He also knew that trying to take the dog back now would cause more problems than it was worth. He knew they should have just stayed in the house, but once again, Freddy’s insistence on something caused another big mess. He figured that Sofya would be over soon and she could help get him back, if need be.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Michael made his decision, as he looked at Tom nervously.<br />
<br />
“I’ll see you around, Tom” he said quietly, turning around to head back to the house.<br />
<br />
“What?” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy barked loudly. <br />
<br />
Buddy let out a loud series of barks, not wanting to see Michael leave him with Tom.<br />
<br />
“No!” Freddy thought to himself, as Tom tugged Buddy on his leash. “Don’t leave me with Tom! Please Michael! Please come back!”<br />
<br />
“Let’s get you back home, boy” Tom said, as he struggled to drag Buddy back to his house. <br />
<br />
Buddy tried to run off in Michael’s direction, but Tom held him back. As Michael disappeared down the block, Tom successfully dragged Buddy by the leash. Soon enough, he was able to move him in the direction of his house.<br />
<br />
“Why did Michael leave me with this guy? Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy let out a tear from his eye. “He just left me with this man and didn’t even try to get me back from him. He just abandoned me. Is he mad at me? Mad about me pushing him to be fucked by Chris? I don’t want him to be mad at me. I just want to tell him that I love him.”<br />
<br />
Buddy was filled with tears in his eyes, as he let Tom walk him back to his house.<br />
<br />
“I hope Michael knows what he’s doing” Freddy thought to himself, as Buddy begrudgingly walked with Tom. “If he’s leaving me exposed like this, then he better have some sort of plan in mind.”<br />
<br />
At Tom’s house…..</p>
