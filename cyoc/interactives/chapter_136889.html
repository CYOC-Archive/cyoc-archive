<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff tried to focus on an image of a fantasy creature as his pet. A blue scaled dragon about his size wearing a collar... However he ended up realizing how intelligent a dragon might be, and how a dragon that was okay with being a pet would likely be sexually kinky... The image in his mind presenting itself to him in his mind&#39;s eye, as quadrupedal as it was a bit of sexual appeal to him slipped in in the form of some modest breasts, and even some lingerie, accentuating a less than animalistic sex, and even some short dark hair to make her cuter.<br />
<br />
When he opened his eyes to see his creation finish materializing, he was stunned by how cute she&#39;d come out, even as he didn&#39;t intend her to be so... Sexy... But she didn&#39;t seem entirely comfortable, and almost a little surprised at her form, and then she spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no... I didn&#39;t give her a personality or memories of her own, so it had to copy...&quot; she trailed off, looking at Jeff. &quot;...Me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked. &quot;Wait, I just made a kinky dragon version of myself?&quot;<br />
<br />
The small dragon tried to give her own breasts a grope with her foreleg&#39;s claw, only to find it didn&#39;t bend that way. She gave a little whimper. &quot;You&#39;re right... I&#39;m... Just a pet now... Your pet, master...&quot; She said, blushing as her tail thrashed.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat down beside her on the bed, and rubbed her back. &quot;You don&#39;t have to do anything you&#39;re not comfortable with... Its not like I intended you to be so sexual... It just sort of...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know master,&quot; the dragoness said, &quot;... But... Its a desire that&#39;s part of me now, I want to serve you. This kink you gave me... Its part of me now... I need you to... Do it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff saw her shut her eyes as she raised her tail, but instead Jeff stroked her hair, eliciting a cute little whine of pleasure as he scratched the base of her horns. &quot;I think you need foreplay… You might want it, but you&#39;re not relaxed enough for it... You&#39;re still embarrassed at the idea... Let&#39;s take it slow,&quot; Jeff said, &quot;besides, you&#39;re my pet now, not a slave, and not a whore... Its just as much my job to keep you happy as it is yours to make me happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragoness Jeff wagged her tail. &quot;If... If you&#39;re okay with that master... I... Ooooh… That is... Nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff gave a little chuckle. &quot;Hmm... If you&#39;re a girl, and you&#39;re a copy of me... Maybe I should name you Jessie.&quot;<br />
<br />
The newly dubbed Jessie purred. &quot;That&#39;s a nice name... Can you scratch under this collar, that would be- ooooh yes.&quot; She moaned as Jeff obliged.<br />
<br />
Jeff was starting to get a little frisky himself, and started kicking off his pants, moving one hand down to one of Jessie&#39;s breasts, eliciting a sharp gasp before loosening up. Jessie turned her head around to kiss Jeff, sticking her tongue in his and lapping under his tongue; Jeff taking this as a cue to move his other hand to her other breast, gently caressing them under what seemed to be a silky pink bra that contrasted with her blue scales, lighter as they were on her underside.<br />
<br />
With a surprising amount of strength for her size, Jessie flipped Jeff off her back with her wings, leaving him lying on his own back, while Jessie padded over to pull Jeff&#39;s dick out of the fly in his underwear, straddling herself on Jeff with her pussy right against his face. Taking this cue, Jeff pulled aside Jessie&#39;s soft panties, exposing her lips to him, rubbing his fingers over the surface as Jessie squeezed her thighs against his face, rubbing her stockings against him.<br />
<br />
With both ready, Jessie wrapped her tongue around Jeff&#39;s Penis, the sensation of it around him almost made Jeff cum there and then, only for Jessie to slow down; leaving Jeff to run his tongue around the lips of her vagina a couple of times, tracing a figure eight across her folds; and as Jessie took Jeff&#39;s member into her maw, Jeff slipped his tongue inside her folds, making her make a sharp whimper around his dick with resonated into him, only for her to let go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough foreplay, if we keep doing this you&#39;ll waste it before you&#39;ve filled me master,&quot; Jessie said.<br />
<br />
<br />
She pulled herself forward, angling her hips to spear herself on him, only for Jeff to lean forward and grope at her breasts, her yelp of surprise sending them both onto the floor with Jessie on all fours and Jeff on top of her. Jeff continued caressing her breasts even as Jessie wrapped her tail around his waist to pull him closer to her snatch, a couple of awkward jabs quickly leading to her letting out a little yowl as he found his way inside her. With a quick thrust, he thrust as far as he could into her, Jessie&#39;s tongue hanging out as it hit its mark inside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as much grip as your tongue,&quot; Jeff taunted, only for Jessie to lick up the side of his face.<br />
<br />
Jeff nibbled one of Jessie&#39;s head fins, and she gasped, feeling as Jeff made shorter quicker trusts. She was so close, she could almost feel it, then Jeff squeezed her tight against him, pressing her breasts together as he did, and she felt all the blood drain to her loins as her pussy milked at his dick, the pulsing of his against hers feeling amazing even as she felt the cool soothing feel of semen rushing into her depths.<br />
<br />
The two lay like that together, exhausted, and soon the climax faded, leaving only afterglow.<br />
<br />
They suddenly heard a hard knocking on their door, followed by Rossie&#39;s voice. &quot;Jeff, we can all hear you screwing your pet dragon; can&#39;t you just take her for a walk like a normal person?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One does not simply take me for a walk Rossie,&quot; Jessie yelled back. On hearing Rossie storm off, the two of them giggled, with Jessie turning over to embrace Jeff with her wings, and all four of her legs, while Jeff held her just as tight in his arms.</p>
