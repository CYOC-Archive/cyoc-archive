<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It looks good,&quot; Ella commented as she and Simone came up on the large rectangular building that had been built on the east side of Lyre.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t quite the same as some of the dance clubs that the two remembered from the past, but it was a fairly impressive structure, at least in the sense that it could accommodate both Humans and Animalians, and according to the floor plan would have a large enough open space that would allow for people to dance the night away. For Ella it was very much something that she figured would be great, bring Disco back as it were, and if not Disco than at least a place where people could go to dance and have fun that wouldn&#39;t be a High School gym or a park the way most dances seemed to be arranged. Some places still had some dance halls, but so far as Ella and Simone knew, most of them were in the major cities on the coasts and were often either for ballroom dancing or ballet.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re sure this will work?&quot; Simone asked to her partner and bond-mate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it will,&quot; Ella said optimistically, &quot;with so many people gettin&#39; young again, they&#39;ll want to get back into things. And everyone can dance the night away.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was largely a reference how the Animalia Virus could either age some one up into the prime of their life or age them back into the prime of their lives, depending on how old they were when they first encountered the Animalia Virus. In Ella and Simone&#39;s case, it was the latter, as becoming Animalians had brought them back into the prime of their youth and both enjoyed it, though missing things that were popular when they were in their twenties soon came along with it. That was the primary reason that Ella had often pushed the idea for a club. And now the club was here.<br />
<br />
It was built a bit faster than had been expected, especially with some of the rainy days that came through, but neither Ella nor Simone could complain. The outside of the structure looked like it had been built with some of the pre-made pieces of siding that were often used in suburban home construction, though the colors seemed to alternate in black and gold. There was one large window on the front that they could see through and see that it lead into a modest area that Ella and Simone had figured could serve as a place to chat and talk and perhaps get a snack or two before going back to dance. Across the upper front of the building was a wooden sign with the name Kat&#39;s Klub written across it in carved wooden letters. Kat was in black while Klub was in gold. The background of the sign was white and there were two cartoonish heads of a panther and a lion on the ends of the sign.<br />
<br />
&quot;And with something as good as this... it&#39;ll be bound to attract customers, beyond some of the riffraff that end up at the Meat Market,&quot; Ella commented, &quot;I mean... it&#39;s fun there, and all... but just about everyone knows that the people that go there, Human or Animalian are looking to see skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or fur,&quot; Simone corrected, given that all of the Meat Market&#39;s dancers were Animalians and most of them were mammal based Animalians.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or fur...&quot; Ella agreed, &quot;but this... this could be good for everyone. Everyone can have a good time to dance and have fun. And hopefully it&#39;ll have a place where we can have a band play jazz, swing, rock, disco, even...&quot; Ella paused to shudder for a moment. &quot;country music. Stuff everyone can dance to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... hopefully the electrical system will work,&quot; Simone commented, &quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be able to pay for a big time band to come in and play in the first year... not to mention that finding bands that can play swing and jazz music right today is difficult.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ella nodded. Some discussions with Annie and Simone had reflected that, and for the most part it was intended that the Kat&#39;s Klub would have a good speaker system on which they could play CDs that would cover the sorts of music that people would want to dance to. That was all to be expected. They system they&#39;d gotten for it was also supposed to be top of the line and would help the club get through the club&#39;s early days until they could afford to hire or attract real bands. It&#39;d hopefully work well, and would go along with some of the other operations that the club would have as part of the business, such as dance lessons for tap, ballet, ballroom, and even disco. Some of the sign ups for the lesson aspects of the club seemed quite good already, which made Ella feel optimistic while they waited for the one of the construction crew to arrive and go over the ins and outs of the building.<br />
<br />
They waited a little while before a larger car pulled up. Both Ella and Simone turned to see a male Beaver Animalian and a more towering Maiasaura Dinotopian emerge from it. The two approached them with some confidence and a polite smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two are early,&quot; the Beaver Animalian spoke, &quot;I must admit... I hadn&#39;t expected that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Simone gave her bond mate a small smirk, &quot;someone was excited.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s perfectly fine,&quot; the Beaver Animalian answered with a smile of his own and then gestured to the Maiasaura Dinotopian with him, &quot;this is Ralph Johnson. He did a lot of the work to help get things built up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t too bad, was it?&quot; Ella wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The hardest thing was getting all the plumbing and wiring set up, but Lyre&#39;s workers were quite agreeable,&quot; the Beaver Animalian answered, &quot;and much of the heavy lifting, Ralph handled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Simone said off hand as her eyes drifted across the Dinotopian&#39;s broad chest and imagining what was between his legs.<br />
<br />
Ralph backed away, catching some of the tone in Simone&#39;s voice and knew that his Annie wouldn&#39;t approve. He&#39;d heard about Ella and Simone&#39;s success at the Meat Market and the friendship they&#39;d struck up with woman named Annie, who&#39;d become a Zebra Animalian. He could respect and tolerate their happiness and their friendship, but his love was only for his Annie. Annie Johnson, who had been the deciding factor in their family becoming Maiasaura to care for Jake when he was born with MS, and the mother of his children. The awkward silence, however didn&#39;t last very long as the Beaver Animalian came forward to lead the group toward the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway... if you come with me, Ralph and I will show you what we have here,&quot; the Beaver Animalian spoke as he lead the way. Ella and Simone were soon to follow.<br />
<br />
They made their way into the building with the Beaver Animalian operated a fairly standard looking key which he then handed to Ella. As they came in, they found that the initial floor in the welcome area was carpeted. It wasn&#39;t super thick, but it was enough to be noticeable to the feet of the four Animalians as they entered. Before them was a small wooden podium, similar to those that one might find in a nice restaurant. To the left was the gathering area that Ella and Simone could see through the window outside. It had a small handful of chairs and one or two small wooden tables.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we have our entry area here, where people can come in, wipe their feet, pay their admittance fee, or say that they&#39;re with a group event or party, and so on,&quot; the Beaver Animalian spoke, &quot;Either of you can handle that immediate welcoming duties from here. To the left is one of the smaller areas where people can rest and socialize for a moment, maybe get a bite to eat or drink, that&#39;s up to your policy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d agreed to offer a few snack foods and non-alcoholic drinks,&quot; Simone spoke, &quot;we want people to be able to have fun, but not get hammered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is enough of that at the Meat Market already,&quot; Ralph grumbled, remembering a scene in which he&#39;d seen one of the Syntixisaurus Rex Dinotopians just totally plastered, though he couldn&#39;t be fully sure if it was Tyra or Heather. It was something that came as sort of a thing that was expected. In Delaware he&#39;d done a lot of construction work as needed, and often traveled from job to job. It&#39;d meant that Annie was the real breadwinner in the family with her job as a nurse. Becoming Maiasaura Animalians meant moving to Lyre/Animalia, where there was more infrastructure that could handle their size better than what Delaware could. And while Ralph had found that there was still construction work to do, it wasn&#39;t quite as frequent, and had meant that he couldn&#39;t contribute as much. <br />
<br />
However, he&#39;d also found that his Annie wasn&#39;t the only woman that had had an interest in him after his transformation. For some Animalians, he could understand that, as a lot of the news reports had stated that Animalians had much higher hormone levels leading to a much higher libido, but the fact that many Human women had also seemed interested in him was surprising. Ralph&#39;s shows were rarer and weren&#39;t quite as exotic as some of the others, mostly because of his loyalty to his Annie, but it did well enough that Ralph felt he was putting bread on the table to help feed Jake and his other hatchlings. It had also meant that he&#39;d seen a fair amount of the inner workings and happenings that went on at the Meat Market. They hadn&#39;t had an incident with an Animalian getting too hammered and either hurting or sexually assaulting someone, but there was the odd occasion where a Human got drunk or got a bit too fresh, and the most shocking thing was often that it was more often Lyre natives than those from outside Lyre/Animalia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully though the Meat Market&#39;s staff can remove rowdy guests who&#39;ve had a bit too much to drink and have the Lyre Police on speed dial if they need to send someone to the drunk tank,&quot; Ella commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;re trying to go for something a bit more classy and even family friendly,&quot; Simone added.<br />
<br />
The Beaver Animalian nodded and motioned over to the right, &quot;and to the right, you&#39;ll have your office area and access to your small snack bar and so on. The door to it will be around the corner here and it will be secure enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; Simone spoke calmly as she looked to the wall to their right. It ran from the door and went about ten feet into the building, and she knew that from the outside of the building there had to be about another twenty feet before the outer wall would be reached, so that had to be the office area.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the music?&quot; Ella asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of the wiring for the speakers was a bit difficult to get in, especially with some of the lights, but that all came out well,&quot; the Beaver Animalian nodded, &quot;and the control for it is from the office area. And if you get an actual band, there is plenty of space along the sides where they could set up to play.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ella and Simone then looked around the main open area. The main dance floor area was a bit lower than where they were, and the floor looked like it was either hardwood or tile of some kind, which would make since if the club would also have space and times reserved for things like tap dancing lessons. Around the edges there were two levels that formed two carpeted steps down to the main dance floor. It looked good. Simone took a step or two to move down onto the dance floor and looked to the lights, by the rectangular plastic covers, she could guess that the lights were fluorescent, but that wasn&#39;t an issue. She could also see multiple air vents, which would be good come the summer and people wanted to get out of the heat.<br />
<br />
&quot;And restrooms?&quot; Simone asked as she looked back to the Beaver Animalian as he and Ralph came out onto the dance floor with Ella looking around at the lights for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the back, we did get the signs up,&quot; the Beaver Animalian nodded and pointed to the back left and right corners where there were doors marked &quot;men&#39;s&quot; and &quot;women&#39;s.&quot; Between those two doors was a third door with the label &quot;custodial/boilor: staff only.&quot; Simone and Ella both looked to the Beaver Animalian. He then answered the unasked questions, &quot;because the only land available to build your club on was here on the Lyre side of the Lyre/Animalia boundary lines and that we&#39;re closer to some of the residential neighborhoods there were some concerns that the Lyre City Council gave when we submitted the designs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They haven&#39;t had a problem with the Meat Market having a unisex locker room... or the Claw Coliseum,&quot; Ella commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Meat Market is closer to the business/industrial part of town, not residential,&quot; the Beaver Animalia answered, &quot;not to mention that they do have separate bathrooms for those who just need to go... So, it&#39;s likely they figure the locker rooms there are there more for the Meat Market&#39;s dancers than anything else. And the Claw Coliseum is in Animalia itself. And since you said you were going for a more &quot;family friendly&quot; club, I didn&#39;t think picking a fight over unisex bathrooms was that necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re probably right there,&quot; Simone said with a nod, &quot;and things look good... you did an excellent job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any activities set?&quot; the Beaver Animalian asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve gotten some calls about WSA wanting to have their Prom&#39;s after-party here,&quot; Ella answered, &quot;Which could be fun...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t prom already a celebration where teenagers go to dance?&quot; the Beaver Animalian asked, sounding puzzled. Ella, Simone, and Ralph all nodded in the affirmative, &quot;So why go from one dance to another?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tradition,&quot; Ralph said simply.</p>
