<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hugo had just finished putting on the right phone calls for his new plan that his doorbell rang. He could have ignored it, but he had to maintain somewhat of a social life as a &#39;human&#39;. <br />
<br />
Hugo put away his testing material, entered the hiding codes that camouflaged the extraterrestrial technology from earthlings. The lab and the dicks themselves did not move. The dildo manufacturing excuse had worked so far. And he had ways to silence intruders anyway. <br />
<br />
The door to his living room opened on a duo of men in light blue uniforms. Great. At least, both men had a certain charm. One was a little past his prime, with grey peppering what had been midnight black before, and a hint of fat over abs from a lifetime of exercise. He gave off an impression of the old guard ready to pass on the torch to someone worthy. The other was the opposite in every way. Lightly tan instead of pale, with shoulder-length silky black hair and tights that could crush someone&#39;s head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Officers John Prickster and Clay Morrison,&quot; the younger man declared. &quot;We are here to investigate your possible involvement in a missing person case. We ask that you cooperate and let us in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo paused only briefly. His systems were too advanced to be understood by mere humans. The officers would see nothing that he did not intend them to. But they might misinterpret some things. Would dicking them right away save him the trouble? <br />
<br />
No, probably not. There might be officers swarming down his place if two of their own disappeared trying to investigate him, <br />
<br />
Mint&#39;s subliminal messages would have to be optimized to prevent this from repeating itself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well. I have nothing to hide from the police.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Morrisson smiled condescendingly, his perfectly straight white teeth almost glowing under the ceiling&#39;s light. &quot;That is for us to decide, sir. Your name is the most consistent element in every story we were told so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmph, annoying. He had moved a bit too fast. A single party was an incident, noteworthy but down a list of priorities, the rumors flying on campus did not mean that no one from the outside heard of them. A parent must have tried to contact one of their dicks - pardon, children, and gotten no answer. Hugo absentmindedly wondered which penis had caused this. <br />
<br />
Not that he would take it out on one of his test subjects. He was too professional for that. But he had been meaning to perfect the Perry method for weeks now... <br />
<br />
The two officer entered, the older one, his stride a hint slower. <br />
<br />
&quot;John, you keep an eye on him,&quot; Officer Morrison said, oblivious to his colleague gritting his teeth, &quot;I will search the rest of the apartment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo took note of the bulky man&#39;s lust filled eyes trailing after the twunk-like officer. So not only frustration but attraction too. Interesting. He was only starting to get better at reading human expression off their faces. Hugo had far more expertise in deciphering the most minute changes on a cock. But it wouldn&#39;t take an expert to note the beginning of a tent in the front of the officer&#39;s pants, or the hints of a blush on his cheeks. <br />
<br />
Hugo suddenly knew how to play this off. <br />
<br />
Officer Prickster turned to him, sighing. He remained standing even after Hugo casually sat down on one of the couches. <br />
<br />
Hugo picked up a magazine to read, absolutely unbothered by this turn of event. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you could be put away for a long time if my partner finds incriminating evidence...&quot;<br />
<br />
It was said casually. Perhaps even with some friendliness. Eager advice, from a figure of authority and, typically, protection. Had Hugo been more naive, he might have believed the words to be a mere warning. No, they had a much deeper meaning. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d hate that,&quot; Hugo said, as if he were talking about the weather. &quot;I heard terrible things about jail. From what I heard, I wouldn&#39;t last a day.&quot; <br />
<br />
Officer Prickster took the bait. &quot;Rumor on campus has it that you have created a sort of weird sci-fi machine that reduce men into their cocks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a strange rumor,&quot; Hugo replied, pretending to be mildly surprised. He would have used his tablet to compound the disinterest further, but procedures. He wasn&#39;t allowed anything that might be contact with outsiders. <br />
<br />
Officer John paced about the room slowly, pensive. He rubbed the scruff of his unshaven cheeks looking like he might explode from keeping some terrible secret inside. The clock kept on ticking. John&#39;s eyes nervously observed the glass doors leading to the lab. <br />
<br />
He licked his lips. &quot;It&#39;s true, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If there is any truth to this, I&#39;m sure your vigorous leader will find all he needs,&quot; -- There! Just mentioning Clay Morrison and &#39;leader&#39; together had brought a snarl to John&#39;s face. -- &quot;Don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
John bit the inside of his cheeks. &quot;He&#39;s... he&#39;s a good officer. With a whole tree up his ass, but, you know, good. He really should learn to loosen up though. You look like a good lad too. I figured, maybe... I could help you avoid getting caught.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; And what of your partner? Hugo thought.  <br />
<br />
Said young man burst into the living room, livid. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is this, sir?!&quot; Officer Morrison demanded, brandishing poor Matthew like a twisted trophy. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is what we call a penis, officer,&quot; Hugo deadpanned. &quot;I do apologize if you were unaware. I would not presume...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t play games with us, Hugo!&quot; Clay spat, waving Matthew in a decisive arc. The poor dick swung heavily, nearly slipping from Clay&#39;s grasp. &quot;The fuck kind of freak are you? There&#39;s dildos lying everywhere in that lab. Or should I try to look up their names on your tablet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, you *can* do it,&quot; John said under his breath. He was quiet enough that Clay missed it, hurtling more insults at Hugo.  <br />
<br />
John glanced at Hugo from behind Clay&#39;s back. The slightest of nods followed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, we&#39;ve seen enough. John, cuff the bastard. We&#39;ve found our culprit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Computer,&quot; Hugo said, and the hidden tech in the room whirred back to life. Mechanical arms extended from glory holes in the walls and lenses on the tip of metallic cables stretched out of the ceiling to surround Clay. <br />
<br />
&quot;John, for fuck&#39;s sake, do something, you useless-&quot;<br />
<br />
The flash cut him short. <br />
<br />
The ensuing silence was immediately broken off by the dull thud of flesh and clothes against the carpeted floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Clay Morrison,&quot; said the computer with an even tenor voice, &quot;ten and a half inches long, six inches of girth, highly productive balls, structurally straightforward, neither leaning left or right, intact foreskin, short refractory period. Model falls above graph curves for penis quality.&quot;<br />
<br />
The computer&#39;s declaration shocked John out of his horny stupor. He knelt next to fallen uniform and poked Clay&#39;s new form at the base of his shaft. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t mind if I took this off your hands, would you?&quot; John said with a smirk. &quot;After all, I did come in with it, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do much better than that.&quot; Oh yes, this one was an obvious choice. <br />
<br />
Without waiting for consent, Hugo grabbed John&#39;s belt and unzipped his pants. The tented boxers had a wet spot near the top, the smell suddenly tantalizing to Hugo. Some effort was needed to remain on track, especially when he pulled down the elastic and freed the middle-aged man&#39;s cock. It sprung free, spurting pre in an arc. Seven inches, left leaning, and resting atop a heavy set of hairy balls. Not bad, not bad at all. It would be a shame, if Clay was not superior in both length and width. Hugo pressed them together. Hard. <br />
<br />
John&#39;s eyes widened as he felt Clay replaced his old dick with his freshly transformed body. He gasped when he felt Hugo add the virtual stitches to keep Clay solidly stuck to his crotch. <br />
<br />
&quot;There. Now your former partner is your current penis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clay&#39;s dickhead reddened and swelled angrily. The few bobs up and down almost smacked Hugo right in the face. A surprising amount of self-control. The length did allow a wider range of movement. Hugo might have been impressed by Clay&#39;s determination and resourcefulness. <br />
<br />
Of course, that was if one did not consider what a jolting dick might feel like for its owner. <br />
<br />
John&#39;s rough hands took hold of Clay&#39;s shaft-body and squeezed. &quot;Fucking perfect in every way, huh, you prideful prick? Well, not this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
As if forgetting Hugo entirely, John stood up and started pumping his new dick as if his life depended on it. His eyes quickly clouded over with rage-like lust. <br />
<br />
&quot;You love it, don&#39;t you, you stupid slut?&quot; John growled at his new cock, jerking hard and rough. &quot;Not looking down on me anymore, are you? Huh? No more Mister-Perfect-Clay-Morrison, next in line commissionner, first to get promoted. Only my dumb fat dick!&quot;<br />
<br />
John came out with a startlingly loud moan. Cum rocketed out of Clay&#39;s mouth and flew just past Hugo&#39;s ear. <br />
<br />
For a moment, John couldn&#39;t move, his knees trembling, his eyes shut close. Clay remained stiff, even with cum dripping from his underside. Grunts rose when John forcibly tucked him back into his underwear. The elastic snapped back with a twang. Even then, Clay&#39;s shape could easily be discerned through the bump in the fabric. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, everything in order, Officer Prickster?&quot; Hugo asked, smirking. <br />
<br />
John finally took his hands off Clay for a few seconds, barely enough to just glance around the living room and grin. &quot;Oh, yes, nothing to see here. Shame my partner called in sick today. I suppose that means you are a model citizen.&quot;</p>
