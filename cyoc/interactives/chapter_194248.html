<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;A Cerberus, for the three of you?&quot; Vari asked shortly after returning to the cash register.<br />
<br />
The young woman, Rebecca Charmer, smiled at Vari who was standing behind the counter at the front checkout.  &quot;We made you a list,&quot; she said as she slid forward her unlocked phone along with her drivers license.  Vari checked the ID, then handed it back to her.  As the orange and purple Nekomata lifted up the phone to look at the Notes app, Beck went on: &quot;I dunno if that&#39;s helpful, but, like, we tried to follow the instructions and a whole lot of the Additions were basically free.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenese D&#299;ng grinned, slapping his State ID on the counter. &quot;It&#39;s just cosmetic!&quot; he called out, chuckling as he referenced his favorite YouTuber.  Vari&#39;s cat ears flicked towards D&#299;ng, but kept her eyes on the idea.  Ken just glanced away, getting the impression Vari didn&#39;t even watch YouTube.<br />
<br />
Vari smiled a grin with one single cat-fang over the front of her lips.  &quot;Let&#39;s see.  Gender Neutral means the center figure will be the one determining the sex,&quot; she verified, motioning to Rebecca herself.  &quot;I see you&#39;ve chosen &#39;Greater&#39; as a modifier.  That <i>does</i> mean a bit more than cosmetic,&quot; Vari remarked, motioning behind her to one of the rule plaques on the back with a big Nekomata thumb.  &quot;It means that you&#39;ll show demon enough for demonic detection and you&#39;ll be viewed as desirable breeding material by denizens of your underwood.&quot;  Vari spoke politely if nonchalantly: &quot;Like all Cerberi, guardians of the gates of hell, you&#39;ll still be totally immune to fire but as a Greater Cerberus, you&#39;ll also be resistant to hell-fire&#39;s mutation aspects.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal Stanford blinked at that response, holding his drivers license to Vari as well.  &quot;We&#39;re gunna be an actual demon?&quot; he asked, not sure he liked the sound of that.<br />
<br />
Vari shrugged, checking the identification of the two men before sliding them back to them.  She then returned to looking over the list on Rebecca&#39;s phone.  &quot;As much as anyone else is an &#39;actual&#39; thing with these costumes.&quot;  Vari glanced up.  &quot;It&#39;s possible you&#39;ll notice enhanced baser urges, but because of the I3C you three&#39;ll keep being yourselves.  The costume won&#39;t change any of that... just be mindful if you find yourself in a dark ally with a demon hunter, your best course of action will most definitely to be the take the suit off and explain the situation,&quot; Vari advised.  &quot;The won&#39;t like it, but killing a human masquerading as demon is their version of a &#39;legal kill&#39; whereas an undisputed human is no-go.&quot;  Their tone was jovial, but their cat eyes were serious as they glanced between the three of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Legal kill, huh?&quot; asked Jamal, the darkest skin of any of the three.  Vari gave the man a knowing look, sighed, and just nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dually noted,&quot; Rebecca confirmed, putting a hand on Jay&#39;s shoulder as she did so... then dropped it down and pressed forward the the purchase.  &quot;All the horns and eyes look right?&quot; she asked.  Vari glanced up at the three of them individually.  &quot;I&#39;d hate to have gotten the wrong sides.  We figured since Jay&#39;s right handed and Ken&#39;s left that Jamie&#39;ll be on my right, Kendra on the left.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vari glanced between the trio and nodded, checking the other options on the list.  &quot;Similar female names, pretty common,&quot; she said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine should be Kenzie,&quot; remarked Kenese.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you don&#39;t have the Forced Names tag, so you can call yourselves whatever you want,&quot; offered Vari as she kept reading the list while making the occasional finger motion over the product.  &quot;I see the additions of Minor Feminine voice alterations; Big Size, that&#39;ll make you just over seven foot tall; Omniped, allowing you to move equally well on two legs or four.  Double-length whip-like tail with spade at the end...&quot; Vari motioned a hand over to the side of the costume.  &quot;Let me just... wave a variable there,&quot; she said.  &quot;You seem like good people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay blinked, watching Vari modify the spell of the costume.  &quot;Something wrong with the tail?  Becca and D&#299;ng rock-paper-scissored for whip versus fluffy... I just didn&#39;t think we should be carrying around a big snake at our rear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vari glanced up at Jamal, then back at the costume.  &quot;Was that the default?&quot;  The man nodded.  &quot;Huh.  Well, if you feel up to trying this again, maybe you could bring a fourth friend along for a Tail-Maw,&quot; Vari chuckled.  Jamal look confused, but Ken leaned in and said they&#39;d explain later.  &quot;Minor Infertility is a good call...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The guys were like &#39;if we&#39;re a girl, guys are going to be a problem&#39;,&quot; Rebecca smirked, putting her hands around each of their shoulders as she leaned forward to Vari.  &quot;Imagine!  Guys mansplaining &#39;women need to be careful around guys at a party with alcohol&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vari smirked.  &quot;Well, since this is a party situation, you should be on the lookout for more than simple, mundane problems.  As a Greater Cerberus you&#39;ll be able to sense purity of spirit, but, also, corruption comes easier to you so keep your eyes open,&quot; she said, but her eyes lingered on Jamal since he was the only of the three humans with a slight sense for magic.  &quot;A Minor Infertility is Minor for a reason... it will protect you while you wear the suit from impregnation, no question... but any minor spell can always be topped by a conflicting spell of a stronger teir.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young man with the slanted eyes looked over the wall.  &quot;You don&#39;t even have a Major Infertility as far as I can see.&quot;  He looked to Vari.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly,&quot; the Nekomata began, &quot;It would be stronger than the magics of the suit to the point where it would be a permanent effect.&quot;  The two men exchanged look that said they definitely didn&#39;t want that.  &quot;As permanent as any effect is, anyway.&quot;  Vari took a breath, and the whiskers at the side of her nose twitched.  &quot;Basically, at the point at which someone at the party used such a spell, you&#39;re probably involving magical and non-magical law enforcement concerning nonconsensual activities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca blinked her blue eyes at Vari.  &quot;That&#39;s a wild euphemism for ra—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please!&quot; Vari interrupted, but as a whisper.  The glanced to their side at the Bernese Mountain Dog that was waiting at the countertop for them to finish their interaction with the three.  Their eyes slid back to Becca.  &quot;We try not to draw attention to having to be placed in the adult district of town as it is...&quot;  She sighed.  &quot;We both know what I said.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young blonde-haired girl dropped the issue.  She knew what Vari was getting at and just because she&#39;d been ever vigilant thus far at college that didn&#39;t mean she was forever safe.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; she admitted.  &quot;We both do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raising a dark-skinned finger, Jamal realized something.  &quot;Wait, so what was the thing about the tail?  Why did you have to change the spell?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vari looked at the tail, then at the three of them.  &quot;Employee judgement to approve something borderline,&quot; Vari explained.  &quot;A spade-like tail at this size, on a tail this long, with the muscles you want in the form are <i>potentially</i> a deadly weapon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken frowned.  &quot;See, I was trying to avoid that by not having the snake-head or scorpion tails.&quot;  He glanced between his friends.  &quot;Is it too late for giant fluffy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rebecca and Jamal said at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;Middle breast?&quot; Vari asked.  &quot;Just confirming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Becky motioned to Jay and Kenny, but it was Kenese who spoke: &quot;Apparently she&#39;s never seen Total Recall.&quot;  Vari chuckled.  &quot;But, yeah, we said if we were gunna have breasts we should each get one.&quot;  The mirth couldn&#39;t be hidden from Vari&#39;s eyes at that.<br />
<br />
With that, Vari moved to looked over the clothing they had.  &quot;Torn denim shorts, loose black torn-up midriff shirt, no underwear, and nail-caps,&quot; said the employee as they were finalizing ringing up the total.  &quot;I think the yellow caps&#39;ll look good on you,&quot; Vari said.  &quot;But if you&#39;re planning to go quadruped, you&#39;ll almost defiantly want a sports bra,&quot; Vari said, and the three looked at each other.  It was the only suggestion Vari had made at checkout and they trusted her opinion at this point.<br />
<br />
Charmer nodded.  &quot;Probably right,&quot; she said.  Then she realized her two friends were staring at her.  &quot;What?&quot;  They both put their hands up on their chest to say &#39;neither of us wear a bra, this one&#39;s on you&#39;.  Grumbling, she hurried aside to the nearby clothing isle and returned with a two Fits All Sizes black sports bra and basic black panties.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vari took them up and added the singular items to the list.  &quot;Well, I think you&#39;re all set.  You changing here or there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did we decide?&quot; Becca asked, looking back at her two companions.<br />
<br />
Kenese D&#299;ng spoke up first: &quot;Real Talk: I wanna run on all fours... and I think if we loped up to the front gates of Marshall Manner like a real demon that&#39;d be pretty epic.  Saves on gas and gives us time to get use to our new big, heavy body.&quot;  Becca looked at Jamal and he just shrugged, mostly indifferent.  D&#299;ng was the smallest of the three, so they deferred to him on that one.  &quot;Might give us a chance to see how powerful &#39;Sexy&#39; is as a tag while we&#39;re at it,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;If someone can be attracted to you, they generally are,&quot; Vari explained, though it was a line she often used so there wasn&#39;t much force behind it.  &quot;Though, since you&#39;re going with the Cispecific, you two understand the body&#39;s going to base itself mostly on your friend here?&quot; she put a hand palm-up towards Rebecca.  Vari wanted to make sure they understood they&#39;d be comfortable as women because Becca was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, mam.  It&#39;s a great body,&quot; Mal chuckled, motioning his hand at Rebecca like he was showing her off.  &quot;Anyway, I&#39;m bi,&quot; Jamal revealed.  &quot;He&#39;s... uh.. bi-curious?&quot;  Jay looked at Ken who just shrugged.  &quot;But, yeah, we get the idea.  We plan to have fun tonight with whatever we finalize into.&quot;  He smirked, putting both hands on the counter.  Becky was pulling out the five one hundred dollar bills to pay for the suit.<br />
<br />
Vari motioned to their immediate left.  &quot;Big slash Huge rooms are right there.&quot;  They thanked her and began to move away from the counter to where Vari motioned.  She bounced on her toes, her breasts shaking, happy to have made so many sales today.  Then, she turned towards the dog near to her and said, &quot;OK, kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the trio walked up to the changing room.  Jamal and Kenese flanking to Rebecca&#39;s sides naturally.  Jay reached forward and pulled the curtain to the side, opening it for the other two.  As Becca stepped inside, a bald man with a big beard gave them a look.  &quot;It&#39;s a three-in-one,&quot; the darker-skinned young man said as his two lighter friends stepped into the room before him.  The bald guy just kept staring.<br />
<br />
Kenesse&#39;s slanted eyes looked over at the older guy staring at them, then back at his tall, basketball player friend.  &quot;I think he thinks we&#39;re gunna whoo-hoo like in The Sims.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay frowned, then followed the two in while closing the right door to the room.  He grumbled.  &quot;Or the thumb just thinks I&#39;m about to do naughties with a blonde chick that could be his daughter while the asian kid watches.&quot;  Kenny&#39;s non-verbal reply was to shrug as if to say &#39;that&#39;s what I said&#39;.<br />
<br />
Becca looked up.  &quot;What&#39;re we talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shrugging, Jamal simply said: &quot;Some cop-looking dude gave me a dirty look as we came in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Phrasing,&quot; D&#299;ng said as he faced the big double doors.  Charmer and Stanford just shook their heads.  &quot;You guys ever seen double-doors for a changing room?&quot;  He looked around the space.  &quot;Man, I bet this would comfortably fit someone fifteen foot tall,&quot; he considered, looking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright boys!&quot; Rebecca called towards the double-doors and the man outside, putting both her hands to the side of her mouth.  &quot;Strip!&quot;  The two started to laugh hard, and Ken made sure that the doors were locked and &#39;occupied&#39;.  Turning around he removed his shirt revealing lack of muscle definition and average body weight.<br />
<br />
Rebecca, for her part, seemed to take no issue with undressing in front of her friends.  Soon enough she was standing in bra and panties alone, also of average weight, though a bit more muscled from spending one day a week working out with Jay.  She started to pull the contents of the shopping bag up and out of the container, leaving the costume on the bench against the wall.<br />
<br />
As Jamal removed his jersey and jeans, she collected them and slid them into the bag.  A moment later, she did the same for Kenese&#39;s khaki pants and GDQ shirt.  Jamal was, by far, in the best shape... but his build was athletic and lithe, not overly muscular.  Still, for a moment there, the three were just smirking, standing in their underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moment of truth,&quot; Rebecca said as she pulled the costume onto the floor and stepped into the big long john-style legs that might have been wide enough for elephant feet.  &quot;Up behind me,&quot; she said to the other two.  Kenese stepped in just to her rear, placing his feet to the inside of her legs.  Jamal stood behind his shorter friend, but put his legs a bit to the outer side of their legs.  All three then pulled the suit up to their waist.<br />
<br />
Over the next minute or so, D&#299;ng leaned to Becca&#39;s left and pulled up the left arm, sliding his hand down into it, holding the sleeve open with his right hand so she could lean in and do the same.  They pulled the suit tight on the left side.  Following identical steps for the right side, Jay and Bee shared the effort there.  Soon enough, Rebecca was zipping up the front of the suit up to their shared neck-hole.<br />
<br />
Speaking with the warmth of his breath against Becky&#39;s back, Kenese laughed.  &quot;I&#39;m in darkness with man at my back...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely bi-curious,&quot; remarked Mal.  The three laughed again.  &quot;Can you imagine if this was all a big joke and magic wasn&#39;t real?  The YouTube video just zooms in on us, waiting for our faces to reflect how we&#39;d been punked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenny fixed his glasses.  &quot;What do I do if my head doesn&#39;t reach your shoulders?&quot; the shorter man asked.  &quot;Hand me my head?&quot;  He leaned around Becca&#39;s left side and pulled the neck line down with his right hand so he could see.  The head with the &#39;L&#39; behind the eyes came into his view, handed over by Jay.  Both Rebecca and Ken lifted it up and dropped it onto his head.  &quot;I hope this doesn&#39;t warp my glasses... but the instruction said—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;—if you don&#39;t keep them on, your eyesight won&#39;t be corrected,&quot; Rebecca finished the though, taking the head marked with a &#39;C&#39; on the inside from Jamal as he picked up the &#39;R&#39; one for himself.  The trio all felt a little silly, and nothing happened right away.  Jamal squirmed, wiggling the three foot tube out behind them as he did so.  &quot;Oh, Jay.  You&#39;re closest to the bag.  There should be big paws like bear-feet slippers...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One sec.  They gotta be under our cloths,&quot; he said, leaning far to their right.  Digging through the back, he found the two big fluffy feet at the bottom.  Tossing them onto the floor, they landed paws-pads down in front of the three of them.  &quot;OK, guys... we just gotta step in like it&#39;s track and field day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenese shook his head.  &quot;Oh noes... anything but that.&quot;  Beck looked down at the floor and Ken sensed her movement.  &quot;OK, Bee.  You&#39;re the leader on this... you lift a foot, direct us like Top Gun on NES.&quot;  He paused.  &quot;Wait, never-mind.  Let&#39;s not invert the controls.&quot;<br />
<br />
She giggled, which wasn&#39;t that common for her... she felt silly.  &quot;OK, guys.  Right foot up,&quot; she said and they all lifted their right foot.  &quot;Forward a bit.  OK.  Stop.  Stop!&quot; she called out as one of them—maybe even her—was still drifting.  There was a knock on the door.  &quot;Down,&quot; she said to the guys, but to the door she called: &quot;Occupied!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a grumble on the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
Jamal smirked.  &quot;Bet it was the thumb.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway... Left foot,&quot; she said, directing them the same way.  &quot;And the moment of truth... down we go and I wonder whaaaaaaaat—&quot; she felt the energy before something happened... but what happened was near-instant.  Who was yelling &#39;aaa!&#39; in shock?  It seemed like all of them at once.  They made only the one vowel noise, but it wasn&#39;t forever... just a reaction as if they&#39;d all been snapped by the same rubber-band at once from toe to head.<br />
<br />
That rubber-band was mystical in this sense, and it started from the left foot the instant they completed the costume.  Their left legs snapped together, keeping the mass from each, first at the toes, then heels, then knees... at which point, the right legs caught up and did the same.  Bone-snapping noises—no, actually... Bone-crushing... Melding!  The three were standing on only two legs now the next snap was at the waist.<br />
<br />
Binding together, Kenese was now taller since him and his friends had the same length of legs... and when the waistline snapped into one, the two men knew right away that their own genitals were gone and the only set was Rebecca&#39;s at the very front.  The cylindrical tube of costume tail puffed up and thickened, seemingly something meaty that they could all feel... but the main body wasn&#39;t done, and the feeling continued upwards.<br />
<br />
Kenny felt stretched as the tummy snapped the three of them together and he squeezed upwards like meat from a toothpaste tube.  Half their ribs were shared, then another crunch and it was all of them.  Jamal and Kenese were pushed out the sides as the main torso snapped into place across the chest with Ken at the left and Jay at the right.  Quickly the motion cascaded down their left and right arms—shoulder, elbow, wrist, then the snap-snap-snap of each joint on their fingers in quick succession.<br />
<br />
They were a single, three-headed person wearing a body-tight black outfit with woven cloth fur hanging off of them.  Their left hand came up in front of their faces, and Kenese turned his head to the side to look at his friends.  Becky&#39;s head was suddenly crushed by the mask, her piercing blue eyes &#39;popping&#39; into place flush with the eye sockets of the canine skull.  In the next moment, Jay and Ken went at the same time... and Ken could feel wet on his eyeballs as the glass of his glasses melting over them in a fraction of a second as the three of them shared looks, their muzzles open in &#39;aaa!&#39; still.<br />
<br />
The entire body&#39;s mass began to change shape as the muscles that Jamal had wanted to keep from the minotaur costume filled them out like a muscle suit.  Their heels shifted upwards as their feet plumped outwards and the soft paw-pads chunked upwards into beefy toes and textured pads.  Claws gripped into the carpeted floor as they all tried to hold themselves upright while their body changed shape.<br />
<br />
Their chest began to balloon outwards, filling up with mass at the same time that their tail began to fill out behind them.  It quickly felt more natural for their body to have a lean forward to it as their digitigrade feet wanted that tail to help balance.  The tail lashed out, smacking one of the mirrors but not breaking it, extending thick from the base all the way out ten feet to the end.  As the shovel-shaped spade flexed outwards at the end, the breasts at their front expanded upwards into porn-stat range, a concession brought over from the Succubus outfit that Rebecca had originally desired.<br />
<br />
Leaning forward, Kenese could feel the rightness of their left hand on the floor, tail arching upwards, and breasts dangling forward.  The thicker fur, canine appearance, and—most importantly—the four-legged stature were the main things he had gotten to keep from the Hellhound he&#39;d picked for himself earlier.<br />
<br />
The hairs near the end of their tail stood up, a stream of spiked ridges made &#39;pluk&#39; noises as they broke through mountain of muscle and black fur, one after the other, up the tail eventually reaching the waist... there the spikes continued up the back as the shoulder muscles defined themselves.  Most of the way up their back, the spikes split off into three trails that lead up towards the center of each of their necks.<br />
<br />
Those black spikes brought with them fur as they rushed up their necks, adding with them a few more inches as they pushed the heads upwards.  Each of the three teens could feel the spikes come up over their skulls, shrinking between their eyes, and shortening to less than a centimeter tall down their muzzles before flatting out behind their newly wet noses.<br />
<br />
The &#39;aaa!&#39; had only been going for a second or two the near-instant taking far longer to describe than for the characters to experience it.  The heads of each of the three transformed all at once, but this was were their individual natures lie... at the top part of the body where their minds were still mostly themselves.<br />
<br />
Rebecca&#39;s hair flowed out behind her down to the center of their back... a yellow scrunchie popping into place, pulling the cascade of blonde hair tight into a ponytail like the one she&#39;d had previously.  Her eyes were still deep blue, piercing, though somewhere between wolf and human as they glanced between her friends.  Pointed ears popped out the earrings she&#39;d been wearing as if a bullet being pushed up from within a werewolf&#39;s body.  Thick bone horns jutted up and back just above her forehead, spiking outwards like a cross between a ram and a stag as they curved downward behind her triangular ears, circling forward to end in sharp points just to the side of her cheeks...<br />
<br />
Jamal&#39;s dreads jumped up and outwards from his skull like pool-noodles breaking the surface of the water, falling and spilling all around his head, excluding around his eyes.  Their red color gave them contrast to his black fur and deep green eyes as he looked to his left at his two friends.  The single metal loop through his right eyebrow popped out around the same time as Becca&#39;s earrings.  Meanwhile the black bone horns came just when her&#39;s did as well, though his pushed forward from the sides of his forehead.  Curving slightly down from their thick basses, the then jutted upwards like the horns of a giant steer, mimicking the same ones he&#39;d had on his minotaur outfit...<br />
<br />
Kenese&#39;s canine skull progressed at the same moment, the black hair he had jutting backwards into triangular spikes to just above their shoulders.  He had no piercings like his friends, but what he lacked in metal he made up for in direwolf-like teeth.  Long, thick, deadly canines spread his teeth back away from them as their oversized nature pushed upwards and curved over his jaw.  The lower ones stopped just to the side of his canine nose, and the upper ones grew down so that they curved slightly under his jaw.  His dark brown eyes bled into black with only the white of his sclera giving the blackness of his irises any contrast...<br />
<br />
A little sign next to the lock of the changing room blinked on with the words &#39;Sound Suppression&#39; lighting up.  The three friends all saw this as their &#39;aaa!&#39; of surprise had ended, their voices now all feminine.  Each of the three heads looked first in different directions to the nearest mirror, their tail wagging in approval as they each saw themselves from their new perspective.<br />
<br />
As the final movement of muscles, fur, and growth all ceased, the three friends each shared an understanding glance.  Their butt rounded back, sitting atop muscular thighs and beneath the base of their strong tail.  Clawed hands left the floor, flexing their new arm muscles and sharp claws as they leaned back upwards into a bipedal stance.  Those three canine heads shifted backwards raising muzzles to face the much closer ceiling at their new seven and a half foot height.<br />
<br />
Without the need for consultation, the trio didn&#39;t honestly care if the room had been sound suppressed or not.  Those muzzles each opened up and let loose a long-winded, commanding, joyful, demonic howl...<br />
<br />
That near-instant transformation was a rush, and they all felt it as one.  Stepping around the room on new legs, the three eventually finished their howl, each once again looking at different mirrors before Rebecca directed their body up to the mirror in front of them.  &quot;Unholy goddamned fuck, we are <i>fucking awesome!</i>&quot; she roared at their image.<br />
<br />
Kenese motioned with their left hand.  &quot;No shit!&quot; was all he could think to say at first.  &quot;Oh, man, look at us... we are one sexy beast.  I would absolutely fuck us!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal grinned a wicked smile.  &quot;Fuck us?  Oh man, fuck,&quot; he chuckled, feeling a new wetness between their legs... well, new to him anyway.  Realizing he was feeling arousal moisten their neatherlips, his green eyes went a little wide.  &quot;Are we &#39;Sexy&#39;—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;—to ourselves?&quot; finished Ken.  &quot;Fuck dude, I think we are!&quot;  They both laughed, and Becca joined in.  &quot;Uh, also... are we slightly drunk?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay tilted his head, the neck&#39;s new length given him just enough to lean forward and look directly over at Ken as Becca&#39;s head had enough room to lean back so they could more easily see each other.  &quot;Dude?&quot; he wondered what was meant, then put a hand on his breast.  &quot;Oh, dude.  She was drunk, remember!?&quot; Jamal asked, pointing at Becky&#39;s face with their right hand.<br />
<br />
She giggled.  &quot;Dudes, I&#39;m a <i>lot</i> less drunk <i>now</i>,&quot; she offered as a thought before whipping their tail around to their front and grabbing it with their left arm.  &quot;We&#39;re definitely ambidextrous now...&quot; she considered as she rand a hand over some of the spikes of their tail.  Bending forward slightly, she looked down at her mostly canine vulva and it&#39;s mildly wet black tri-lipped surface.  &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; she nodded, putting a hand down to their crotch.<br />
<br />
D&#299;ng blinked, looking over Charmer&#39;s head to Stanford.  &quot;Are we about to masturbate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca shook her head.  &quot;Not with these talons,&quot; she said, moving their left hand up in front of of Kenny&#39;s muzzle.  He redirected it to get a better look at their paw-pads.  &quot;Hm.  Never done this as a canine, but the beans may be the answer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Their body shifted in the room so that their right hand could reach into the shopping bag again.  This was mostly directed by Jamal who retrieved the small packets of yellow nail-caps and showed them to the other two.  The three of them worked together to slide the little blunt-tipped, silicon, claw-caps onto their large talons on their hands.  Running the left index finger&#39;s claw over the right hand&#39;s main pad, they all collectively felt safer with themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;We gotta ask,&quot; Jamal said, looking at Becca.  &quot;And this isn&#39;t two to one... we&#39;re all friends here.  Do you—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys,&quot; Rebecca chuckled.  &quot;We&#39;re in a public place,&quot; she said and the two men were ready to quickly dropped the subject.  &quot;So we gotta be fast,&quot; she added with a wicked grin to her muzzle.  Jay and Ken glanced at each other, with D&#299;ng moving their left hand up to the left breast.  &quot;We could only afford the base two hands, so... you two start and I&#39;ll direct.  I&#39;ll be our woman as response,&quot; she giggled, feeling a little silly, but... also... damn they were sexy.<br />
<br />
Jay reached down between their legs and carefully rubbed the silicone nail-caps of their index and middle finger on their right hand to either side of that canine/human hybrid clit.  Being careful with their new strength, he carefully moved their fingers to tease along their lips... slowly adding another finger carefully passed their labia.<br />
<br />
While Jamal worked his magic, Rebecca envisioned a boy she dated back in high school... her first time.  He was the reason she thought &#39;big black cock&#39; was just a fact for a while.  Smirking, she could feel everything Jamal was doing with their right hand, and she joined him in control and redirected his motions right to where they needed to go.<br />
<br />
Their left side, where Kenese resided, was focused on trying to find just where and how to circled and or kneed that left side breast.  Closing his black iris&#39;d eyes, he imagined the licking fires of hell all around them, a crowd of hellhounds ready and waiting for the direction of their mistress.  Without thinking about the implications, Ken&#39;s mind found this super-hot, and the Cerberus that they were had a trio of visions in their different heads all heightening their arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, we are so hot right now...&quot; moaned Becca.  &quot;We should... we should... we should stop by the adult store,&quot; she said without a second thought for how this story might sound retold later when they became three people again.  She and Jamal slowly inserted another finger while D&#299;ng pulled up their leftmost breast to his lips and licked his foot-long tongue around the areola.  Jay and Bee both caught sight of it before each slowly extending their canine tongues in panting to see and confirm their tongue length and bifurcation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet... there&#39;ll be sexy werewolves at the party,&quot; the head with the slightly slanted eyes spoke.  A moment later, Ken used his tongue to pull the nipple into his muzzle, encompassing it with his black lips.  Sucking in time with their motions, they moved their left hand to focus now on the middle breast.  Rebecca leaned forwards and licked her tongue around its areola just as Kenese had as she left the thrusting in their snatch to Jamal.<br />
<br />
Stanford&#39;s motions kept their right hand moving, but briefly hesitated.  &quot;I think we&#39;re going to—&quot; and all three heads finished the sentence at the same moment: &quot;-cum,&quot; they concluded in unison.  Their legs shook, their tail wrapped around their right leg, and all together the three heads opened their maws and silently lifted heads back.  As their body shook from the resulting orgasm, all three sets of eyes looked down as something came out from them.  Wet, clear liquid shot from their crotch and stuck the lower part of the mirror in front of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re a squirter,&quot; Jamal and Rebecca said at the same time, both as equally surprised and impressed.<br />
<br />
Their body shuttered, and Ken managed to moan: &quot;That&#39;s a thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca nodded her canine head.  &quot;Not for me, but... maybe Sexy with succubus leanings?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay shrugged their shoulders.  &quot;Or it could just be this body...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This body is awesome,&quot; both Becca and Kenny said at the same time.<br />
<br />
The &#39;Sound Suppression&#39; light had faded and there was now banging on the door.  A man&#39;s voice was yelling, and the three collectively realized how much the triangular ears on their heads could pick up.  His heartbeat was accelerated, and they each realized for themselves they liked the fear and anger that it meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prey,&quot; the each softly said.  Then their eyes opened wide as if each person couldn&#39;t figure out why the two others had said that.  &quot;Wait... what?&quot; all three asked.  &quot;We... we seem be... syncing more,&quot; they said.  &quot;Whoa... cool.  Also... sobering,&quot; they chuckled, leaning back against the mirror behind them where their bag was.  &quot;Who&#39;s prey?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal smirked.  &quot;Bet it&#39;s the thumb.&quot;  The two others looked at him.  &quot;What?  Dude looks like a thumb,&quot; he chuckled as their body went through the clothing bag. They stepped into the black panties easily.  Taking the sports bra, they pulled the straps so they were to either side of Becky&#39;s head.  Snugging their breasts up, Jamal called to the man at the door.  &quot;We can&#39;t make out what you&#39;re saying!&quot; he lied and only just noticed his feminine voice.  &quot;We&#39;ll be out in a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pulling up the big denim shorts whose leg holes were folded upwards at the bottom, they pulled down a big black shirt that said &#39;More Than Masks&#39; on it in silvered letters.  They put the remaining yellow nail-caps on their toe-talons.  One of them used Rebecca&#39;s shirt to clean up the mirror, and then they moved over to the door with their shopping bag slung over their shoulder by their right hand.  A moment later, they took their prehensile tail and took the bag from their hand, holding it up behind them, wrapped with the spade as the end of the knot.<br />
<br />
The trio pushed open the double doors and stepped out, a mass of black fur and muscle, seven and a half foot tall.  There was a confidence in their sexy swagger and all the nearby occupants of the store took in their appearance.  That Sexy tag to their costume doing work as everyone that could be attracted to them, was... including the bald man with the big beard who backed up out of their way.<br />
<br />
The Cerberus leaned forwards so their three heads were closer to the man&#39;s face.  &quot;Unless that&#39;s silver, in that gun—&quot; the Jamal head said, eyes looking to the holstered weapon the man hat his hand at, &quot;—we think you should reconsider,&quot; finished Rebecca.  Kenese chuckled, smiling at the man.<br />
<br />
As the Cerberus sauntered away from him and towards the front of the store, the left head, Kenese D&#299;ng whispered, leaning over to the other two: &quot;Why did we do that?&quot;  He paused.  &quot;Also, does silver hurt us?  I thought that was werewolves?&quot;<br />
<br />
Their shoulders shrugged a response, but it was hard to tell who did the motion.<br />
<br />
Rebecca Charmer, the center head, just smiled a white canine grin, talking through her teeth: &quot;I think we&#39;re really really a Greater Demon, guys.  I think we&#39;re doing demon <i>things</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their right hand waved to those staring up at their sexy body, then also to Vari who was ringing up the man who&#39;d pulled her away to ask about centaurs.  Jamal Sanford, the right head, also spoke through smiling teeth: &quot;Should we worry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; Rebecca said as they stepped out the front door and passed a woman yelling at the dog they&#39;d seen at the cash register earlier.  &quot;I don&#39;t think we have to worry about things that small,&quot; she said.  Rather than disputing her wording, the two men just nodded their heads.  &quot;So,&quot; she went on, &quot;Where to?&quot;</p>
