<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Candlewick and Pinocchio walked calmly along the streets of the amusement park on Pleasure Island. They had just gotten off the roller coaster and now were in search of what to do next. <br />
<br />
&quot;Say Pinoke,&quot; Candlewick started to say to his wooden friend. &quot;How&#39;s about we go play a game of billiards at the pool hall next?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pool hall? I haven&#39;t see one.&quot; Pinocchio replied. Candlewick then pointed to a building a few steps to their left that was shaped like a giant 8-Ball and had a giant pool cue next to it. <br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s the pool hall,&quot; Candlewick said. &quot;Can&#39;t exactly miss it. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll have some more beer for us to drink and plenty of cigars.&quot; <br />
<br />
Pinocchio thought for a minute before replying &quot;Okay, Candlewick&quot;. As they walked towards the building, Pinocchio began to note how quiet everything had gotten all of a sudden. Earlier the streets had been crowded and noisy and now they had become barren and quiet. <br />
<br />
Where were all the other kids?<br />
<br />
Both Pinocchio and Candlewick had intended to catch the show at the circus tent earlier, but when they got there they found that the doors were shut and locked tight. So they decided to ride some rides, which ended up being a good decision as there were practically no lines to wait in.<br />
<br />
Candlewick pushed up the saloon styled doors of the pool hall and stepped right in with Pinocchio only two steps behind him. <br />
<br />
Inside were pool tables -- poker tables -- and a fully stocked bar with kegs of fresh beer to drink. And best of all, it looked like they would have the place all to themselves. Candlewick and Pinocchio both picked up a beer mug from the bar and poured themselves a glass of beer from the nearby kegs. <br />
<br />
The pool table was already set up for play and all they needed was to get a pool cue to start. &quot;Okay, Pinoke,&quot; Candlewick said as he selected his cue from a nearby rack. &quot;I&#39;ll start and then it&#39;ll be your turn.&quot; <br />
<br />
Pinocchio nodded his head and took a seat in a nearby wooden chair that featured the head of a donkey carved into it. &quot;This place sure likes donkeys.&quot; Pinocchio thought to himself as he took a swig of his beer and a puff of his cigar. <br />
<br />
After selecting his cue, Candlewick turned his attention to the game at hand and took his shot, whistling that catchy tune Honest John had sung when he recruited him to go on the coach to Pleasure Island. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you suppose all the kids went to, Candlewick?&quot; Pinocchio asked as he continued to relax in his chair. &quot;They’re around here, somewhere&#39;s.&quot; Candlewick replied as he line up for his next shot. &quot;What do you care?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candlewick then executed a masterful trick shot that landed the 3-Ball in the right hand corner pocket. &quot;You’re havin’ a good time, ain’t ya?&quot; Candlewick asked as he took another puff of his cigar. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh, I sure am.&quot; Pinocchio said happily as he watched on in awe of his friend&#39;s skills. Finishing his cigar, Candlewick put it and out and remarked: &quot;Oh boy! This is life, huh, Pinoky?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! It sure is!&quot; Pinocchio exclaimed as he took several more puffs on his cigar. &quot;Ah, you smoke like me grandmother!&quot; Candlewick said sarcastically. &quot;Come on, take a big drag, like this!&quot; Candlewick then lit another cigar and inhaled it deeply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Candlewick&quot; Pinocchio said as he tried to imitate his friend&#39;s actions. He took a very big drag on his cigar, only for it to cause his face to turn red and his eyes to water.<br />
<br />
Candlewick took another whiff of his cigar. &quot;Hey, some fun, huh, kid?&quot; Pinocchio nodded, albeit nauseously. &quot;Okay, slats, your shot.&quot; <br />
<br />
Pinocchio got up and climbed atop the pool table unsteadily. He tried to line up his cue with the 8-ball, but he just couldn&#39;t steady himself. &quot;What’s the matter, slats? Losing your grip?&quot; asked Candlewick, amused by his friend&#39;s reaction. Undeterred, Pinocchio concentrated and moved to take his shot when suddenly a he heard a voice cry out:<br />
<br />
&quot;PINOCCHIO!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pinocchio and Candlewick both turned to see Jiminy Cricket enter the pool hall and leap up onto the table. He pointed his umbrella towards the boys and began to berate them for their bad behavior. <br />
<br />
&quot;So this is where I find you!&quot; Jiminy said angrily. &quot;How do you ever expect to be a real boy?! Look at yourself… smoking, playing pool!&quot; Jiminy raised his leg and kicked the 8-ball, but instead of moving it, all he got was pain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oww!&quot; Jiminy yelled as he hopped up and down on one foot. <br />
<br />
&quot;You’re comin’ right home with me, this minute!&quot; Jiminy continued. &quot;Your father must be worried sick about you.&quot; Candlewick leaned in closer, amused by Jiminy&#39;s presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... who’s the beetle?&quot; he asked as he picked up Jiminy and lifted him high into the air. &quot;Let go! Put me down!&quot; Jiminy commanded as he struggled to free himself from Candlewick&#39;s grip. <br />
  <br />
&quot;He’s my conscience!&quot; Pinocchio explained with a smile. &quot;He tells me what’s right and wrong.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Candlewick shot back in disbelief, dropping Jiminy back down to the table in the process. &quot;You mean to tell me you take orders from a grasshopper?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Grasshopper?!&quot; Jiminy replied in equal disbelief at what Candlewick had called him. &quot;Look here, you impudent young pup! It wouldn’t hurt you to take orders from your grasshop--- your conscience, if you have one.&quot; Jiminy then proceeded to climb atop the 8-ball. <br />
<br />
Candlewick closed his eyes and shook his head. &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.&quot; he said, clearly uninterested in what Jiminy had to say to him. &quot;Screwball in the corner pocket.&quot; Candlewick then took his next shot with his cue, sending both the 8-ball and Jiminy down the corner pocket. <br />
<br />
Jiminy barely had any time to react and narrowly avoided being crushed by several pool balls that fell down the pocket after him. Jiminy once more climbed back up onto the pool table to confront the boys. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why, why--- ya young hoodlum! I’ll knock your block off!&quot; he said angrily as he took off his jacket and put up his fists as if he was going to fight Candlewick. Candlewick however found Jiminy no threat and just laughed. <br />
<br />
Pinocchio tried to mediate with both of his friends. &quot;Oh don’t hurt him, Jiminy. Candlewick&#39;s my best friend.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your best friend?!&quot; Jiminy exclaimed. &quot;And what am I? Just your conscience! Okay. That settles it!&quot; Jiminy picked up his Jacket up off the table and hopped down onto the floor. &quot;You buttered your bread, now sleep in it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Candlewick continued to laugh at Jiminy. &quot;Go on, laugh. Make a jackass outta yourselves.&quot; Jiminy said as he headed to the door. &quot;I tried, Pinoke. I’m through! This is the end! Goodbye.&quot; <br />
<br />
And with that Jiminy left in a huff. <br />
<br />
Pinocchio started to call after him, but Candlewick shook his head and waved him off. &quot;You don&#39;t need that grasshopper telling you what you can and can&#39;t do, Pinoky,&quot; Candlewick said as he poured himself another mug of beer. &quot;A guy only lives once. Live it up a little and let him go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pinocchio nodded his head sadly as Candlewick moved to continue their game of billiards.</p>
