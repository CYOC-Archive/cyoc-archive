<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec woke up on the floor. The not quite white ceiling of his hotel room greeted him.<br />
He shot up and looked around. &quot;Amber?!&quot; He heard his voice. The spell was gone.<br />
He looked around the room and apparently so was she.<br />
His body ached. He slowly got up and sat on the bed. He looked outside at the clock tower. He&#39;d been asleep for over an hour.<br />
He looked at his arms and body. Other than the new bruises, nothing looked out of the ordinary. What did she do? Did she even do anything?<br />
Maybe she just left him with some bruises. Her cold eyes flashed in his mind and he shivered, he needed to check his body out.<br />
<br />
He limped to the bathroom. Subconsciously he held his breath as he slowly moved before the mirror. He felt himself deflate, looking back at him was his own familiar face. So she didn&#39;t do anything there either. Could she even change him? Her specialty was infiltration or espionage or something, which was logical with her minor morph self skill. But as the name said, it wouldn&#39;t work on another.<br />
Still, he pulled his shirt off and winced at the bruises on his torso. But nothing out of the ordinary.<br />
Maybe she had been content to just beat him up. He tenderly touched the bruise near his ribs and recoiled. God knows she did an ace job there.<br />
<br />
He sat down on the toilet lid, which somehow felt different. He shot up and looked at his ass. Did it look bigger! He turned and looked at his profile in the mirror. No, this was his mind playing tricks on him. Maybe that was her endgame. Psyche him out, while doing nothing. <br />
But that wasn&#39;t going to work on him. He was too smart for that. He glanced at his feet, they looked the same. As expected, obviously. <br />
He inspected the toilet. &quot;Wait, why am I checking the toilet?&quot;<br />
Was he losing his mind? Why would she even cast spells on the toilet, what was it going to do? Bite his ass? Eat his junk? Get clogged and have pay the hotels plumbers bill?<br />
<br />
He sat silently for a while, listening. Waiting. Nothing. Well at least he learned more about his own powers. <br />
He&#39;d had enough of this. Nothing was happening. He got up and stretched. He immediately regretted that as he felt the pain in his ribs. <br />
Now that he was better acquainted with his power, he needed to do some shopping and prepare for a next mission. That is, if he wanted to make something of his life here.<br />
Maybe they sold some of those HP regenerating potions in this world so he could fix up his bruises. He needed to take a leak first though.<br />
He lifted the lid, unzipped the top of his pants and grabbed nothing. He felt the blood rushing from his head, he must&#39;ve been whiter than the ceiling he woke up under. This couldn&#39;t be.<br />
He didn&#39;t want to look, yet slowly he looked down. His boxers appeared empty. &quot;No!&quot; He fumbled as he tried to pulled his pants down in a panic and stared. <br />
<br />
Gone was his penis. &quot;NO!&quot; Nestled between his legs instead were two smooth mounds, split with a line between them. &quot;NO!&quot; A small nubbin, his clitoris, peaked out from between mounds. &quot;NO!&quot; He had a vulva. &quot;no...&quot;<br />
A million thoughts were rushing through his head. Pregnancy, menstruation, peeing sitting down, being a man. Was he still a man? He looked in the mirror behind. He still looked like himself. That bitch had turned him into a cuntboy.<br />
He let himself fall down on the tiled floor of the bathroom and stared between his legs. Was this real, he gently touched it. Having had the body of a girl not too long ago, he recognized the feeling. He felt a finger brushing his labia. &quot;no...&quot;<br />
She&#39;d not just given him a vagina, she&#39;d given him a vagina with a much larger than average clitoris. He gently touched the clit peeking from between the labia. And recoiled in horror, it felt slightly more sensitive than his dick. More sensitive than when he was Amber even. And it was his. <br />
&quot;How dare she!&quot; His mind was racing again. Having sex, going on adventures...what if he was stuck like this?<br />
He took a deep breath. &quot;Okayokayokay, calm down.&quot; He told himself. He took another deep breath and held it in a few moments before slowly deflating. <br />
<br />
&quot;This needs to be fixed. I need to find her!&quot; He pulled up his pants and dashed out of his room into the hallway. He ran to Amber&#39;s room and pounded the door with all his might. &quot;Open up Amber!&quot;<br />
No response came. &quot;Oh crap, what if she left?&quot; <br />
He&#39;d been out for an hour. He dropped to the floor and tried to get a peek underneath the door, but the seam between the door and the ground was much to narrow.<br />
He jumped back up and bolted downstairs to the empty reception. This was like a nightmare. He slammed the bell multiple times.<br />
An impeccably dressed young man, with hair that seemed perfectly glued in place hurried in from the door behind the reception desk. &quot;Take it easy on that bell sir or was someone murdered?&quot; He said with a friendly smile.<br />
Not yet, he thought. &quot;Is the blue haired woman in room 101 still in this hotel?&quot; he asked instead.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not really something that I should share with everyone. Was something stolen?&quot;<br />
&quot;YES! Something very valuable was stolen! I need to speak with her! NOW!&quot; <br />
The man was shocked at the outburst. &quot;If something was stolen, please also report it to the local authorities. This hotel takes no responsibili...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes yes, it&#39;s not your fault. Blahblahblah! Just tell me please!&quot; His please sounded much more desperate than he wanted. But he needed to find her fast.<br />
The young man looked taken aback, but hurriedly summoned a screen and started typing away.<br />
C&#39;mon, c&#39;mon, c&#39;mon! He was tapping the ground impatiently.<br />
&quot;Just as a last check, can you tell me her name?&quot;<br />
&quot;Amber!&quot; He blurted out.<br />
&quot;Well, she wasn&#39;t blue haired when she left. But I can confirm that the woman who was in room 101 left about an hour ago.&quot;<br />
&quot;FUCK! Which way!&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know sir. You know, as I said earlier if something was stolen...&quot; the man trailed off in his sentence as Alec glared at him.<br />
<br />
Alec ran outside and looked around. &quot;FUCK!&quot; The square was filled with people. Why were there so many people! Even if it wasn&#39;t an hour ago, finding her would&#39;ve been difficult. If not impossible. Especially since she could change her looks at a moments notice.<br />
&quot;NO NO NO!&quot; He ran out into the square up to the fountain. And looked around again. This was hopeless. <br />
He dropped himself on the edge of the fountain and became acutely aware of his predicament. He now knew why sitting down felt different. His pants were empty.<br />
He held his head as his thoughts raced through his mind again. People walking by stared at him or hurried along trying not to see him.<br />
&quot;Okay. Take it easy.&quot; He took a deep breath again. So a mage cursed him and he couldn&#39;t find her to undo it. What were his options.<br />
&quot;If she cursed me, I can be uncursed! He&#39;d seen her card, she wasn&#39;t a top class mage or anything. All I need is another mage!&quot; He felt hope again. &quot;I need to go to the wizards guild!&quot;</p>
