<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake very quickly pulled on a pair of boxers he found sticking out of a drawer - he supposed his taste in underwear had changed now in as much as the rest of his life. It seemed the new him was really very much into the athletic lifestyle, whereas before Jake had been not exactly the most built young boy. But now? Now Jake could just feel how strong he was. Standing there with his strong if slightly heftier build in a pair of tight boxers. They really did flatter him pretty well---<br />
<br />
But Jake&#39;s increasingly indulgent thoughts - which might be down to his originally weak body in contrast to the new stronger one - were interrupted by the door getting a knock. And when the door opened, Jake instinctively covered the front of his boxers with his hand as his dad came in. Reality might have changed but Jake still definitely did not want his dad seeing him in any way shape or form like...like that. Except now there was a different sense of why he was covering up.<br />
<br />
Not exactly a son covering up in front of his father, but more of a grown brother not wanting to be seen in an embarrassing position---<br />
<br />
Had their relationship shifted at some point along the line?<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s dad winced as he walked in, and turned, &quot;Oh! Sorry, did I come up at a bad time? I just thought we were going to be heading out to the park today for that jog and uh, workout after. Just thought you were taking a bit getting dressed! I&#39;ll uh, see myself out.&quot; Jake&#39;s dad Zeke was a tall, seemingly mousy man with a mop of unkempt dark brown hair on his head, gray eyes, and blocky glasses, a dress shirt, and heavy pants furthering the vibe that Jake&#39;s dad, like Jake, was a complete and total nerd...<br />
<br />
...And despite this, it could best be described as a facade. Zeke didn&#39;t exactly show it often, enough that Jake had honestly never really assigned much importance often...but underneath his heavy and obstructive clothes, Zeke was built like a tank. Like a certain mild-mannered reporter, despite the unassuming guise he assumed, he had an astonishingly ripped, muscular physique under there. One he just seemed far, far too shy to show off regularly.<br />
<br />
Jake had if not barely considered it felt inadequate whenever Zeke did however accidentally show what he had going on. Now that he had a somewhat more mature eye, Jake almost wondered if his shy and bookish dad didn&#39;t cover up to avoid making the less than athletic Jake feel bad via comparison, as many young people these days were wont to do.<br />
<br />
Jake shrugged and figured now he could keep up with his dad in the field and in the gym. He got dressed in a tank top, shorts, and a pair of running sneakers, and headed out shortly after. Deciding he could enjoy himself later. When he got out he saw his dad---brother---whatever was standing by the staircase, waiting to go. The one year older man was of all things wearing a long sleeved, billowing shirt, track pants, and of course his glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;You still not gonna wear a tank?&quot; Jake found himself ribbing at Zeke.<br />
<br />
Zeke answered, blushing, &quot;You know how I feel about that. You like showing off your body, that&#39;s fine. I just...well, I don&#39;t. The world has more than enough dudes flaunting their six pack abs. I don&#39;t need to add to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake shrugged, figuring his brother had always---wow, the memories really were filling in pretty nicely for him right now. He remembered it seemed that he and Zeke had been nearly the opposite of each other back in high school. He&#39;d been the popular guy, Zeke had been the wallflower nerdy type that never really socially blossomed. Except when Zeke got to sophomore year, he supposedly &quot;read that lifting weights improves general health and mental wellbeing&quot;, and so he started lifting. And he kept on lifting. Day in, day out, and he took it vastly more seriously than any of the other guys.<br />
<br />
Few people back in high school knew Zeke was bodybuilder-level ripped by the time he finished senior year, with how seriously he dieted and took care of himself. He even then dressed entirely in very concealing clothes. The one time he had to wear a tank top, the thin white undershirt being the only one he had, on literally the hottest day in the year, everybody - everybody - was just astounded by what nervously walked into school that day.<br />
<br />
Jake chuckled at the memory. He took his fitness...almost as seriously. He loved partying and drinking too much to really be as serious as Zeke. Not like Zeke carried himself in a particularly intimidating way the way the stereotype might suggest. Jake remembered lifting with Zeke a few times, and even in the gym, he was timid and nerdy - trying not to grunt or shout loudly.<br />
<br />
Before long as the two of them headed out for their jog, Jake noticed that today...it was pretty hot out.<br />
<br />
Zeke wiped his forehead and groaned, &quot;Oh boy...&quot;</p>
