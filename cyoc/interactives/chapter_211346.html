<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What the fuck was that?!&quot; Greg shouted. It&#39;d taken him a little bit to get up off his back, but once he did he went over to scold Jeff. However, the large bear didn&#39;t seem to mind in the slightest. He continued to lay happily on his back, running his claws thick his thick belly fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;All part of the game,&quot; Jeff chuckled in his sleep. &quot;Looks like you had a bit of fun too.&quot; His finger pointed at the still mostly erect dick attached to the lion.<br />
<br />
Greg instantly tried to cover himself up, but the loin cloth did nearly nothing to cover the large amount of meat between his legs. He felt his face burn as now both of them knew exactly what his cock looked like. &quot;Whatever,&quot; he scratched his face absentmindedly as he looked at anything other than Jeff or Charlie. <br />
<br />
In the distance dark clouds were starting to form. A rumble of thunder rolled over the empty field. &quot;Guys...&quot; Charlie said. &quot;I think we need to find somewhere pretty fast or we&#39;re going to be covered in wet fur...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Greg sheathed his great axes on his back. &quot;C&#39;mon big guy,&quot; he pat the bear in the belly. &quot;Time to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t wanna...&quot; Jeff rolled to the side. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got to be shitting me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Guys,&quot; Charlie said running a bit ahead of them. &quot;I think we&#39;d better get going. Now.&quot; His voice was urgent as the sound of rain was getting louder. A wall of water could be seen coming down just over the hill. <br />
<br />
Greg growled at the notion of getting wet. &quot;You&#39;ll owe me later,&quot; he told Jeff. Then squatted down and rolled the big bear onto his shoulder. With his impressive strength score and barely any items on him, even the big burly bear felt like almost nothing. To Greg, it was more surprising just how easy his body listened to him. He just thought about lifting Jeff and then his body did it in the most efficient way possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Over here!&quot; Charlie called out to Greg. It took him a second before he saw the wolf peeking out of an abandoned shack. Even if the roof wasn&#39;t fully on there, there would at least be a chance of them staying dry. Greg did his best to rush but felt like he could only make it 30 feet per six seconds. The bear was heavy and really slowing him down. The rain was growing louder, but he was able to make it just in time. <br />
<br />
The rain pounded on the roof, just barely missing them. &quot;Shit...&quot; Greg grumbled as he dropped Jeff onto the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey~~&quot; Jeff whined as he rubbed his head. &quot;I still have some hit points to lose. I only lost about half mine from that encounter... I don&#39;t want to actually go down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie rolled his eyes, but Greg was not about to let that stand. &quot;ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!? What the fucks even going on! Why am I a lion!? Why&#39;s Charlie a wolf!? Why did we just get sexually assaulted by slimes!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... You could have tried to enjoy it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg grabbed his axe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah! Woah! Woah!&quot; Charlie jumped between the two of them. He gently pressed against Greg&#39;s arms to stop him from swinging. &quot;We still don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. And Jeff seems to have at least some idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph!&quot; Greg glared with all his might but lowered his weapon. He took a step back and took another heavy breath. &quot;Well?&quot; he demanded.<br />
<br />
Jeff continued to lie there in and out of his happy dreams. Soft snores would occasionally come out of him as he rubbed his belly and bloated pecs. His small cock would jump with joy as whatever he was thinking about would run through his mind followed by happy giggles as though he was dreaming.<br />
<br />
Greg gave Charlie another huff. &quot;Jeff,&quot; Charlie tried to maintain the peace and poked him awake. &quot;I think you need to tell us what&#39;s going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? What&#39;s there to say? We&#39;re playing DnD but a fun version. Maybe I should have been a bard... Oh well,&quot; Jeff shrugged at the thought as he rolled back over. Charlie was quick to roll him back. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I get that. Sort of. Don&#39;t fully understand it, but how do we get out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. The plot? I don&#39;t know. I know I said I worked on it with Finn, but I told him to erase my memory of it, so it&#39;d be more fun that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
That only drew more confusion out of the two. &quot;What do you mean, &#39;erased your memory?&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? Oh... I don&#39;t know. I think part of that must have gotten erased too. Maybe we phrased it wrong. But anyways, if you guys are really such kill joys there&#39;s supposed to be some device somewhere that you&#39;ll be able to change anything about the world that you desire. But I&#39;m not really interested in it. Really, I just hope there&#39;s more slimes...&quot; A smile filled his face as he drifted back off into sleep, gently snoring as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess he&#39;s really tuckered out...&quot; Charlie said.<br />
<br />
Greg continued to glare. The pouring of rain on the old roof kept his silence from being too awkward. &quot;Whatever,&quot; he finally said before taking his corner of the room that wasn&#39;t dripping and turned over to face the wall.</p>
