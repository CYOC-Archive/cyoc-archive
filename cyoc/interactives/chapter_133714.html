<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Blake covered in as much clothes as possible rang an apartments in New York. A woman&#39;s voice came from an intercom asking &quot;Who is it?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake said through his mask &quot;It&#39;s the guy who&#39;ll help you with your baby problem. Mr. Pregnancy&quot; He was rung in and a short elevator ride later was at the door of his client. <br />
<br />
Knocking on the door a man answered and asked &quot;Who are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake said &quot;Mr. Pregnancy. You guys called me here, Saw that you agreed to my online waver. Are you ready?&quot; The man let him in. In the living room was a woman laying on the couch. <br />
<br />
The man asked &quot;So why are you so bundled up? It&#39;s the summer.&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake said &quot;A single bump or tap, skin to skin, with any human female and they become pregnant with my children. Why should I have any skin open with a curse like that?&quot; He looked to the  woman and back to the guy and asked &quot;Do the two of you have any questions?&quot; <br />
<br />
The man asked &quot;So your saying you can make an infertile woman pregnant?.. and there&#39;s no way it could be mine?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake shook his head and said &quot;No, the way my curse works the baby can only be mine... and yes, as long as someone has a womb my curse will find a way.&quot; <br />
<br />
The woman asked &quot;Why do you call it a curse anyways?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake looked to the woman and said &quot;Well when it first showed up I got my sister, mother, and once close friend pregnant... That friend wasn&#39;t allowed to see me since then, and let&#39;s just say family matters were complicated... Let&#39;s say less about the pre-schooler who bumped into my leg  once. Can&#39;t get rid of it, but figure I could do what I could. So what no questions about the process or billing?&quot; <br />
<br />
The man asked &quot;So yeah. How does this work?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake said &quot;At the minimum I tap her with my finger for less than a second and she&#39;ll be pregnant. You&#39;ll be free to pay me when signs of pregnancy show up so you know this wasn&#39;t a scam... At most I could hold my grip on her and within the session she&#39;ll have given birth and be lactating the sustenance for the baby... or we could stop it anywhere in the middle. Any requests?&quot; <br />
<br />
The woman said &quot;Not the end. Definitely not the end! We aren&#39;t ready for that at all!&quot; <br />
<br />
The man shrugged and said &quot;Well how about we start with a lump forming? Then we could just get the money out of the way and have plenty of time.&quot; The woman nodded <br />
<br />
Blake took off one of his gloves and asked &quot;Would it be fine if I touched your belly? It can be anywhere, but if you want me to be precise it would be wise to leave your stomach womb area exposed. I think you know why.&quot; The session ended like normal. A couple was now expecting, and Blake got his paycheck. A few sessions a week and Blake didn&#39;t have to worry too much about money. Bundled in the summer heat Blake got a few groceries, and he got back to his apartment. He sighed, same ole same ole. Cooking for one, playing a game or two online, absolutely no probabilities of having any intimate relationships. The doorbell rang, well not so much cooking for one right now, Blake answered the door and saw two thirteen year old boys with a strong family resemblance come back. Blake said &quot;Cody, John, nice to see you two... You guys are thirteen then right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Cody said &quot;Yes we are thirteen, Yes we  got any girls we touched tested...&quot; <br />
<br />
John said &quot;WE&#39;RE CURSE FREE!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake starting to cook something for dinner said &quot;Well hope this custody thing will go well, Although i&#39;d still be careful. Who knows maybe the curse will come later on.&quot; The basically twins were rather closer, Cody was quieter and his mother was Blake&#39;s mother as well, and John was born from Blake&#39;s sister. His more conservative mother, and more outgoing sister probably having some influence. <br />
<br />
Doing some finishing touches Blake put a handmade pizza in his Oven and then said &quot;Well then, anyone want to play a game or watch T.V?&quot; Then someone rang his doorbell. <br />
<br />
John asked &quot;Expecting someone dad? Got a date?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake shook his head and saw a 13 year old girl outside with some bags who seemed kind of familiar. He quickly bundled up and Cody asked &quot;So it&#39;s a girl?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake said &quot;Yes, and I don&#39;t know who she is... I think. Better safe than sorry.&quot; then after mostly covered up he answered the door and said &quot;Sorry for the wait, but who are you and why are you here?&quot; <br />
<br />
The girl said &quot;Are you Blake?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake said &quot;Yes?&quot; <br />
<br />
The girl said &quot;You have a power to make girls pregnant?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake repeated &quot;Yes? What&#39;s the point.&quot; <br />
<br />
The girl said &quot;I came here, because my mother was Courtney!&quot; Blake saw the resemblance. <br />
<br />
He said &quot;I see. Thought you looked familiar in some way. So is there something I can help you with?&quot; <br />
<br />
The girl said &quot;I came for advice, and maybe a place to sleep.&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake said &quot;It&#39;ll be a little tight. I have some of my other children with me right now. Although I can find some room if your fine with being in the same apartment as me and two other guys about your age.&quot; <br />
<br />
The girl said &quot;Some more bastards from your power?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake said &quot;I guess your all bastards... by definition really, but they were from my mother and sister. They weren&#39;t from irresponsibility considering one would make contact with their family daily right?&quot; <br />
<br />
The girl nodded and bringing in some of her bags John said &quot;Hi there miss! I&#39;m John, brother here&#39;s Cody, who are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
The girl said &quot;I&#39;m Cynthia, your half sister.&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake checked on the pizza and said &quot;Well I always make enough for some leftovers... So food shouldn&#39;t be a problem right now...&quot; he rose up and asked &quot;So then Cynthia, what do you need help with?&quot; <br />
<br />
Cynthia said &quot;I&#39;m pregnant.&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake said &quot;So you only ever held hands with guys at most?&quot; <br />
<br />
Cynthia said &quot;Yes... after a few days after my thirteenth birthday my period had been late and... We tested and i&#39;m going to have a child... Only problem is that I have no idea who the father is and... Having this curse is just going to be too hard to live with.&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake sighed and said &quot;Well with my particular curse I either bundle up or stay far away from girls. With you in particular i&#39;m not going to risk anything as who knows how our curses will interact. Heck my curse is how I make a living. Allowing the infertile to have kids at the fraction of the cost science takes currently... but I can tell your curse is a lot more of a hindrance. If a baby comes out a boy you can&#39;t breastfeed him or you&#39;ll get pregnant and... Thinking about it, this would limit all honest lives you can really hold. Relationships with men couldn&#39;t be that intimate... I&#39;d say get a good collection of girl friends together and live with them and do online work. Your free to stay here for now, but be careful...&quot; he turned to his boys and said &quot;And you two don&#39;t even think about skin to skin contact with her.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cynthia seemed rather sad after hearing everything and muttered &quot;My life was a mistake wasn&#39;t it?&quot; <br />
<br />
John heard laughing and said &quot;All us Bastards were definitely mistakes! If you heard the story then there&#39;s no other interpretation!&quot; Blake was about to say something but Cody help up one finger. John said &quot;Heck heard enough from GrandmaMa and SisAunt that we made our family situation really weird and strained... Me and my brother here had to be really careful around the opposite sex for awhile and still are in case that curse comes up, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it does. Besides though whether we originally were mistakes or not we can still make our lives worth living no?&quot; <br />
<br />
Cynthia then...</p>
