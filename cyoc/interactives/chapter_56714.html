<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick was a regular guy living a regular life. He was thirty-six with short brown hair, <br />
hazel eyes, and a little bit of a gut. He was relatively happy with his life even though <br />
he wasn't married and didn't have a girlfriend. He had a pretty good job which allowed <br />
him to have a small apartment. Like a lot of kids he was bullied in school but unlike <br />
most other kids he stood up for himself. His grandparents had passed away when he <br />
was in high school which upset him a bit but he didn't feel as sad as people thought he <br />
should since he believed their spirits lived on. He had led a pretty typical life until one <br />
day when it all changed.<br />
<br />
On this day Rick couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching him. No matter <br />
where he went he felt it but he wasn't able to catch anyone watching him. A couple <br />
times he thought he saw the same person but he couldn't be sure if it was or not. <br />
Once he got home he shook his head and muttered, &quot;I must be imagining things.&quot; He <br />
went about the rest of the evening still feeling like someone was watching him. He <br />
thought he was being ridiculous but he just couldn't shake the feeling of being <br />
watched. He considered that there might be hidden cameras but with today's <br />
technology he doubted he would be able to find them if there were any. It was with this <br />
uneasy thought that he went to bed.<br />
<br />
Rick felt someone shaking him and heard a girl's voice say, &quot;Come on Lynette get up <br />
or you'll be late for school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick opened his eyes to see a girl standing right over him and shaking him. He sat up <br />
fast and asked, &quot;Who are you? How did you get into my apartment?&quot; He didn't notice <br />
that his voice had changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know me Lynette,&quot; the girl said. &quot;I'm your sister Yvette.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have a sister,&quot; Rick said shaking his head, &quot;and my name's not Lynette. My <br />
name is Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd better go get Mom,&quot; Yvette said. Before he could say anything she turned around <br />
and ran right through a closed door.<br />
<br />
Rick sat there stunned at what he had just seen. He got up out of the bed and went <br />
over to it. That's when he noticed that it wasn't a door but a poster of a door. He put <br />
his hand against it and felt the paper and the wall behind it. That's when he noticed <br />
his hand looked different. It looked smaller and slimmer. Looking at his wrist he <br />
noticed that he was wearing something when all he wore to bed was briefs. The sleeve <br />
had hearts and snowflakes in red, pink, and what looked like a green color. He looked <br />
down to see that what he was wearing went down almost to his knees and it was <br />
ruffled at the hem. He didn't pay too much attention to it though as he saw the chest of <br />
it sticking out a bit. He slowly raised one hand and pressed the bulge in the chest area <br />
and found that the bulge was his chest. As he was staring at what was obviously his <br />
breasts some black hair fell into his vision and he just knew that it had to be his. He <br />
needed to see what was downstairs so he lifted the hem of the gown and saw that he <br />
was wearing pink bikini style panties. He gulped and pulled the front of the panties out <br />
to find that he no longer had a dick and no pubic hair. He was so startled by this that <br />
he sat back down on the bed without any conscious thought and muttered, &quot;This can't <br />
be real. I'm a guy not a girl,&quot; over and over.<br />
<br />
Soon Yvonne came back with a woman who had to be her mom. The woman came up <br />
to Rick and said, &quot;Your sister told me that you said your name is Rick and that you <br />
didn't have a sister. Is this true?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick looked up at her and said, &quot;My name is Rick and I'm a guy not a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman sighed and asked, &quot;You don't remember anything before waking up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do remember that I was a guy before I woke up,&quot; Rick said shaking his head. &quot;I <br />
remember the past thirty years as a male.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman sat on the bed and put an arm around Rick hugging him to her and said, <br />
&quot;I need you to listen to me. A few days ago a hunter tried capturing you with a <br />
poisoned arrow. Your sister dealt with him and brought you back. Dr. Roberts was able <br />
to administer an antidote but you developed a high fever which broke last night. Dr. <br />
Roberts said that you could go to school today but she warned me that due to your <br />
high fever that you may not remember much. We heard you talking in your sleep and <br />
you were saying your name was Rick. Now I'm not a doctor but I think your dreams <br />
may have buried your memories of your life for now. I'll have to ask Dr. Roberts about <br />
it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick looked up at the woman and asked, &quot;You mean my life was just a dream?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman nodded and said, &quot;The life you remember was just a dream. Now your <br />
last name is Alvey and my first name is Annette. I'm your mother and Yvonne is your <br />
identical twin sister. You're eleven years old and by a strange twist of fate you were <br />
born on October thirty-first and your sister was born on November first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick looked down at his body and thought about his life. Was his life just a dream or <br />
was this the dream? He figured that the answer would become clear in time so he <br />
should just go with it. He looked back up at Annette and asked, &quot;Why did a hunter try <br />
to capture me and how did Yvonne deal with him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Annette looked a little angry and said, &quot;The hunters hunt us because of our power. We <br />
can transform people into anything we want. Your sister transformed the hunter who <br />
poisoned you into a doll which you have been sleeping with. Understand one thing <br />
about our power. The only people who we transform against their will are those that <br />
deserve it like bullies and criminals. If someone wants to be transformed willingly we <br />
may transform them if we choose to. In order to transform someone we have to <br />
physically touch them and will them to transform in to what we want them to transform <br />
into. There is on limitation to our power. We can't do any mental transformations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what does that mean to someone who's a doll?&quot; Lynette asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they remember that they were human and are aware of being a doll,&quot; Annette <br />
said with a smile. &quot;This is why we only do transform those that deserve it against their <br />
will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we change them back?&quot; Lynette asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can though you can only restore someone who you transformed,&quot; Annette said <br />
picking up a doll off the bed. &quot;For instance no matter how much you will it this doll will <br />
remain a doll since your sister was the one to transform him. If she chooses to she <br />
can transform him, or I should say her, into a human again or anything else. If she did <br />
reverse the transformation then you could transform the hunter. However only she can <br />
transform her until such time as she reverses all the transformations done on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Lynette said nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd better get ready,&quot; Annette said giving Lynette a little squeeze. &quot;Your sister will <br />
help you to get ready. Breakfast will be ready in a few minutes so don't take too long.&quot; <br />
With that she got up and left the room.<br />
<br />
Yvette came over and said, &quot;Come on sis let's get you ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynette noticed that Yvette had black hair and blue eyes and figured that she did too. <br />
She took off her gown and panties and just stared at her crotch for a minute or two <br />
before Yvette threw a pair of white bikini style panties at her saying, &quot;Come on sis <br />
don't let your mind wander.&quot; Lynette blushed and put the panties on. Yvette handed <br />
her a navy polo dress and once she put it on discovered that it just about went down <br />
to he knees. Next were the white tights and the black Mary Janes. Finally Yvette <br />
picked up a heart shaped necklace with some type of pink stone in it. &quot;This necklace is <br />
what enables us to pass through the doors in our home,&quot; Yvette said. &quot;The stone in <br />
your's is called Rose Zircon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynette suddenly felt like she had to pee so she asked, &quot;Where's the bathroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just follow me,&quot; Yvette said and went through the door.<br />
<br />
Lynette put on her necklace and went over to the door thinking that it wouldn't work. <br />
She reached out a hand and pressed it against the door. To her surprise her hand <br />
sank into it. It felt like she had just put her hand in a tub of water. She took a deep <br />
breath and walked through the door. What she saw amazed her. She did seem to be <br />
underwater and there were fish swimming around. A school swam through her causing <br />
a tingling sensation which caused her to laugh. Once she was done laughing she took <br />
a deep breath then realized that she was able to breathe. This surprised her since she <br />
had thought she was underwater. She saw Yvonne on the other side of a doorway <br />
and went to her. Walking through that doorway was like breaking the surface of the <br />
water except she wasn't wet. Yvette pointed to a picture of a bathtub and said, &quot;When <br />
you get inside put your necklace on the door to lock it. If you take your necklace off <br />
before going through Don't let go of it in-between or you'll drown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; Lynette said slowly and nodding. She took off her necklace and wrapped the <br />
chain around her hand so she wouldn't drop it and went through the door. Once on <br />
the other side she turned around and placed her necklace against the door. Her <br />
bladder gave an urgent signal and she let go of her necklace and raced to the toilet. <br />
She just barely sat down when her bladder released. It felt strange peeing from <br />
between her legs instead of from a dick like she remembered. She again questioned <br />
which one was the dream but didn't have an answer. She shrugged and finished up <br />
then headed to the door. She was shocked to find that her necklace was still on the <br />
door and not on the floor. She figured that when a necklace was on the door that it <br />
was locked and no one could come through. She had to wonder how someone would <br />
come in if there was some type of emergency. She would have to ask about that. She <br />
grabbed her necklace and put it back on while she walked through the door. On the <br />
other side Yvette asked, &quot;Did you wipe and wash your hands? Mom will be mad if you <br />
didn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; Lynette said sighing. She did know to do that even if she didn't remember being <br />
a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well breakfast should be done by now,&quot; Yvette said with a smile. &quot;The door is a <br />
picture of a table in a kitchen down this way. I'll race you there.&quot; At that she took off <br />
running and laughing. Lynette smiled and ran after her.</p>
