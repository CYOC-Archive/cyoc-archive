<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait!&quot; Jennifer said, making Hanna a bit startled. &quot;Before we do anything... I want to try something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Hanna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This might probably sound stupid and I don't know if it works but I'll try it anyway...&quot; Jennifer said before uttering the words &quot;transform or dare!&quot; Well, at least she could say the curse!<br />
<br />
Hanna didn't know what to say. She was certain that this wasn't going to work. In fact, it pained her to see her friend still trying to get out of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please say transform!&quot; Jennifer asked.<br />
<br />
Hanna sighed before she said &quot;Alright, transform, but Jenny, why do you think this will work? I mean, you've tried it already, didn't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer, recovering from a fierce orgasm once more, then said &quot;Actually, I was too busy with getting touched and punished for being clothed today that I completely forgot to try it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Hanna had to giggle at this. It was so typical for this to happen to Jennifer. She always forgets to do that which is most important and focuses on the small things instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, you chose transform so... we'll now see whether this works!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Even if you can pass on the curse, I made it so that Kyle can't change me in any way, even through other people!&quot; Hanna interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;While that is true, I'm not doing this for Kyle, remember?&quot; Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
Hanna had to admit, she hadn't thought about that! Both girls got very hopeful as Jennifer started to say the transformations that would happen to Hanna.<br />
<br />
&quot;For your transformation, you will transform into a regular girl without a penis. Also, clothes won't harm your immune system anymore and from now on, you will find clothes very comfortable again. Finally, everyone except for you, me and Kyle will remember you this way as if you've been like this all along.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls shut their eyes, hoping that when opened them, Hanna's dick would be gone which would be an indication that the plan had worked. However, they were saddened to find Hanna, still naked, in the possession of a dick.<br />
<br />
Jennifer sighed &quot;It didn't work... but that's okay... I mean, we still have each-other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hanna looked at her friend. She had dreaded that this would happen. &quot;Oh Jennifer... I'm so so- AAAAH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer, after panting once more, was shocked to find her friend suddenly screaming. &quot;Hanna! What's wrong?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-it's gone... it's really gone!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What i-... OH MY GOD! It's gone!&quot; Jennifer joined in on Hanna's joy. soon, both girls were dancing around the room, knowing that from now on, everything was going to be better again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After Jenny sneakily crept downstairs like a ninja to get Hanna's clothes, Hanna tried them on to find them, for the first time in years, feel very comfortable again! For the first time in her life, she felt comfortable wearing female clothing and it made her happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear, I don't know what to say... thank you so much!&quot; Hanna said, after which she embraced Jennifer in a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're very welcome! But now it's my turn&quot; Jennifer said with joy, looking forward to wearing clothes properly again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, but we have to think of this one since your curse was quite a powerful one. Can you tell me the exact lines of Kyle's curse?&quot; Hanna asked.<br />
<br />
Jennifer nodded and told her everything about the curse that she'd gotten.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, here goes nothing! Jennifer, transform or dare!&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was panting again but knew that other than this, she had to stay quiet in order for it to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, it's been a minute now. For your dare, from now on, you will be able to wear clothes again. Also, you will not have an orgasm anymore when people call you by your name. You will be able to eat and drink again and you can use the toilet normally once more. You will again be able to make people stop if they try to do anything to or with you. For your transformation, you will return into the regular old Jennifer again that we remember as you were a week ago. Everyone, except for you, me and Kyle, will remember you that way again and they will forget that the curse that Kyle gave you ever happened and reality will again chance accordingly. Finally, from now on, you will be bisexual, just like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was a bit shocked to hear about that last bit of her transform but she also found that she kind of liked the idea! &quot;Wow! That's a mouth full!&quot; Jennifer giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes it is. now, let's see if it worked!&quot; Hanna answered.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, stupid socks, they're always gone when you need 'em!&quot; Kyle said, rummaging through his stuff. He was about to go look into the laundry when his phone rang. &quot;Yes, who is this?&quot; He asked through the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, is this Kyle Perkins?&quot; A familiar-sounding female voice came through the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, yes? Who is this?&quot; Kyle asked. He was sure he'd heard this voice before somewhere. Only too late, he realized that it was none other than...<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer Smith...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle remembered it now. His ex-girlfriend Jennifer Smith who he'd cursed a few months ago! He had to smile, thinking about Jennifer walking around naked all this time.<br />
&quot;Jenny! Who's it been?&quot; Kyle asked amused, expecting to hear loud moans from the other side of the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite good actually... oh, I'm sorry, I mean ooooh, aaaaaaah, ooooh so goooooooood&quot; Jennifer said, while another female voice in the background started laughing.<br />
<br />
On the other end of the line, Kyle came to realize that Jennifer was normal again. How could that be?!? Suddenly, Kyle was scared. If she was normal again, that meant she had the curse!<br />
&quot;H-h-how did you...&quot; He stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;There was one flaw in your curse, Kyle. A curse as powerful as this one has to be passed on. A simple dare cannot undo this.&quot; Jennifer replied, feeling incredibly good about making Kyle scared like that.<br />
<br />
Kyle nearly shat himself. He knew that we was going to end up like the new slut-Jennifer times 10 or something!<br />
<br />
&quot;And I'm sure you know what I will say to you now, right?&quot; Jennifer giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please! Don't do it! I'll do anything!&quot; Kyle begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't want me to say goodbye to you then?&quot; Jennifer asked innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! Wait, goodbye?&quot; Kyle asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, goodbye. I'm not going to curse you Kyle. Whatever made you think I would do so.&quot; Jennifer said while Hanna was heard laughing even more in the background.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... but... why?&quot; Kyle stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;For one, do you seriously think that I'd give the curse back to you? My dear Kyle, I thought you were smarter than that.&quot; Jennifer answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... why did you call me then?&quot; Kyle asked, feeling somewhat relaxed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to inform you that I'm back to normal again. I have been since the same day you cursed me and, my ex-boyfriend, you should know that I might change my mind about this curse. Maybe I will think of a good one after all. If so, I'll call you right away to let you know!&quot; Jennifer said excitedly.<br />
<br />
Kyle didn't take too long to realize how she was turned normal again: Hanna! It was her that had changed Jennifer back to normal! That bitch!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that's about it. And don't bother trying to change phone-numbers. My dad can easily discover it again. Goodbye Kyle&quot; Jennifer finished off before hanging up the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny, you passed on the curse weeks ago to Susan to help her get rid of her stage-fright&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but Kyle doesn't know that&quot; Jennifer said with a wink.<br />
<br />
Both girls started laughing again before embracing each-other in a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I'm starting to thank that boy for transforming me. If it weren't for him, things wouldn't have let to this.&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said it!&quot; Jennifer replied, thinking of the terror-struck Kyle one last time before kissing her girlfriend.</p>
