<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With cat-like stealth, you decide to sneak a peek around the place. There were more magic type objects and curio type things mixed into a normal living space. You don&#39;t even need to turn on the lights for your cat eyes to be able to read all the books on your Uncle&#39;s bookcase. Mostly normal things you would expect in a home, dictionary, business books, popular novels, what maybe was a section for your cousin, and ...spellbooks. You slipped one out to read, before peeking in on the costume shop. <br />
You bite your lip realizing how easy it would be to slink down there and try something on, but you decide against it. Not wanting to make your situation any worse. <br />
Getting into your pajamas you go to your bed on the couch and thumb through the magic book. But it was all indecipherable, too much magic jargon for you to understand.  Besides, you weren&#39;t sure how magic worked. Did you have to be a wizard by birth?<br />
<br />
You glance over at your cousin and Uncle&#39;s closed bedrooms, then decide to go to sleep. Tired from traveling here to begin with. <br />
----<br />
<br />
You woke up to the smell and sound of someone cooking breakfast. The kitchen was attached to the living room so it wasn&#39;t far from where you slept. Something was annoying you though, a pain in your spine caused by how you were twisted. <br />
You reach around to fix it and feel... something furry.... following it with your fingers all the way up to where your new cat tail sprouted from your back. <br />
<br />
You lurch up and fall off the couch. Remembering. <br />
You hold your head, so it wasn&#39;t a dream... <br />
With bleary eyes you stumble into the kitchen to sit at the table as your uncle served you and your cousin waffles and eggs. <br />
Your cousin was stifling a giggle perhaps remembering what she did to you last night. <br />
You squint your slitted eyes at her in annoyance, ears pressed down. <br />
<br />
&quot;So.&quot; you announce &quot;Magic is real?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yup&quot; Your uncle and cousin reply in unison. <br />
You chewed on your breakfast additionally chewing over these new facts. But you had questions. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why wasn&#39;t I told about this?&quot;<br />
&quot;We weren&#39;t allowed&quot; Your uncle said &quot;If too many people know about magic it could upset the world order.&quot;<br />
You pause thinking about it, that made sense. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok well... why don&#39;t I have magic? We&#39;re related.&quot; Your mind had gone back to the spellbook you&#39;d found. Remembering last night in better detail. French maid costume, getting boobs, becoming a cat girl, becoming a cat boy... and that ... feeling of heaviness in your balls resting on the chair as you sat. As if you had clinking weights inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh.&quot; your Uncle sat down &quot;We can&#39;t tell you that either. For all intents and purposes, you have a wizard uncle and a witch cousin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Jess by the way.&quot; Your cousin added, &quot;I look forward to having you here all month.&quot; she smiled as if she was up to something. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m John... but you probably already knew that.&quot; you looked hopefully at your Uncle &quot;So um. If magic is real and you&#39;re a wizard. You&#39;re gonna change me back now right? Didn&#39;t you say you could figure it out in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um yeah.&quot; Your Uncle replied looking thoughtful, but wasn&#39;t making any motions to get started on that cure he&#39;d promised. &quot;I&#39;ll definitely work on it today...&quot; he said vaguely. <br />
Then got up and put a mason jar on the table, it was full of softly glowing blue marbles. <br />
&quot;Jess.&quot; he said &quot;Eat your vitamin&quot; <br />
<br />
She pulled one out and ate it. <br />
You cocked your head<br />
&quot;Weird shaped vitamins...&quot; you half asked. <br />
&quot;We&#39;ll explain in due time.&quot; Your Uncle responded. <br />
<br />
Your cousin pointed a fork at you.<br />
&quot;So John. Did you pack a nightie or did you find that in the shop?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; You squinted, then looked down. What had been a plaid set of ill-fitting pajama&#39;s from the night prior, was now a nightie of the same color. You must not have noticed since you were still waking up, and had the blanket from your bedding half wrapped around you. <br />
Your ears shot up as you immediately stood up, chair squeaking across the floor, examining the fabric. It even had a little silk bow at the top, lined around the arms and bottom with lace. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t put this on!&quot; you shouted, face feeling hot in embarrassment. <br />
&quot;Interesting.&quot; said your Uncle rubbing his beard &quot;Go put something else on John.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yeah! Duh!&quot; you snapped back, digging in your suitcase for clothes for the day. You picked out a red jersey, crew socks, and white shorts. The most masculine things you could think of to cover up all of this. Rushing to the bathroom to change. <br />
You kind of looked like you&#39;d stolen your dad&#39;s clothes, the jersey was so much bigger than you remembered, the shorts maybe needed a belt, but your femme hips seemed to keep it upright. You were definitely smaller, but you weren&#39;t sure by how much. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; you stated emerging from the bathroom &quot;This is better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your cousin started laughing, your uncle just seemed fascinated. And no wonder. You were able to look down and see the change take place before your eyes. It started with your feet, your socks lengthening and thinning as they crawled up to your knees and popped lace up magically. Your shorts were shrinking and losing the border between the legs, turning it into a white skirt in a similar style and length of the shorts. Your jersey shrank into a fitted tank top, a little bit short but not quite a crop top, still showing about an inch of skin on your waist. <br />
&quot;What the hell!&quot; You shouted, tail puffing up. And you felt something else. The loose boxers you had put on, something was ... shifting. <br />
You peeked in subtley, pulling the hip of your skirt to the side, not wanting to show anything to family, and saw the finishing touches of what had been black boxers turning into lacy black panties. Your smallish dick snugly hanging inside. <br />
Your face was red. <br />
<br />
&quot;O-Ok!&quot; you pointed demandingly at your extended family &quot;Witch! Wizard! Fix this! Me-ow!&quot; <br />
You hadn&#39;t meant to say meow, you had meant to say now, but you decided to act like you had said the word correctly. <br />
Your cousin was still laughing, but it seemed like your Uncle maybe didn&#39;t want to upset you anymore than you already were. <br />
<br />
Your cousin cracked her knuckles <br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry cuz, I got you&quot; she pointed with a glowing blue nail, the same color as the marbles on the table &quot;Augere muliebris indumentum!&quot; <br />
A beam shot out from her finger and hit your clothes. <br />
Your uncle sighed <br />
&quot;Wrong&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; your cousin sputtered, genuinely seeming to have had confidence a minute ago &quot;What was wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well you soon found out. Your socks went from knee length to thigh length, your skirt fluttered into layers of lace and got much shorter, barely covering your ass. And your red tank top, proudly claiming the #02 became a v-neck crop top. Well nearly like a girly sports bra. <br />
Your face was red with embarrassment. Face hot. You felt something of a wedgie, crap did you have a thong? <br />
You had to hide your expression as you felt your underwear hold you tighter, almost as if it was tailored for you. However you had a feeling if you had to start running you might slip out. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; you shouted, tossing your new &#39;nightie&#39; into your suitcase. It hadn&#39;t changed back into pajamas &quot;I cannot stay here a month. I&#39;ll figure something out...!&quot; You sputtered. Beginning to dig in your suitcase for something that maybe wouldn&#39;t change into a femboy&#39;s dream fit. You were going to bend over, but you felt the air on your thighs. You don&#39;t think you&#39;d ever worn something this short before... <br />
Keeping your back straight so as not to show off you squatted, trying to rearrange and repack your clothes. <br />
<br />
Your uncle stood up.<br />
&quot;Hey John. It&#39;s ok. We can work on the clothes thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your ears were flat<br />
&quot;No! I didn&#39;t come here to be humiliated. I&#39;m already missing Halloween with my friends by being here. I&#39;m not sticking around the whole month just to have my stupid cousin embarrass me like this!&quot; You huffed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah exactly Halloween. I need the extra hands this month. October is a busy season for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why don&#39;t you just give that to someone on the street&quot; you spat back pointing angrily at the feather duster that had seemed to make you obedient the night prior. While the French Maid outfit had seemed to mess with your head, it hadn&#39;t been until you had picked up that feather duster it seemed- that you had desired a master and begun cleaning. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well we can&#39;t really have the police investigating...&quot; Your Uncle Jack started <br />
&quot;Again&quot; Your cousin added. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m sorry but you&#39;re just going to have to figure it out&quot; You continued to rifle through some clothes, debating on a button up to be your new outfit of the day. &quot;Because there is no way I&#39;m going to go work in public there like this.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your Uncle Jack sighed coming closer and picking up the feather duster with some tongs. <br />
&quot;Sorry John&quot; He said tossing it your way.</p>
