<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She couldn't believe her eyes when the box was opened and she saw that her new owner was Kyle.<br />
&quot;Welcome, my little pet, did you enjoy your trip here?&quot; he said with a mocking smile on his lips.<br />
If Jen had been her normal self, she would have kicked him in the balls right there, or scratched his eyes out with her new paws. But with her personality changed, she didn't have the guts to do it.<br />
<br />
Still smirking at her, Kyle started to explain his plan:<br />
&quot;You may wonder why I went through such trouble to change the whole world, when I could just have transformed you right away with the curse. Well, you haven't seen much of this new world so you haven't noticed that it's basically the same as the old one. We are still near our hometown, our school and everything else still exists. This is basically the world you grew up in, only I am now a wealthy and influential man and I have a mansion just outside of town away from any neighbours, so we can have our fun together without anyone noticing. In theory, you could try to run and tell the police, but they'd probably just put you in a lab somewhere. And anyway, I have taken some precautions to prevent that. And be warned, the people that changed you have given me a couple of custom syringes, so I can change you further if I feel the need to punish you. Oh, speaking off- Now that you are at your new home, there's no need for you to be so formally dressed anymore. Rob, go ahead and inject the first of the special syringes please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bu-&quot; before Jen could protest, one of the guards that had carried her there pulled her by her arm. She felt the sting before she even saw the syringe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll let you find out on your own about the effects. For now you can go to your chambers and get acquainted to your new body. Rob an Edward will escort you there.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two men dragged the unwilling Jen down the stairs of the mansion into the cellar, where they put her in a big room with a heavy wooden door and electrical light, but without windows. The room was big and looked comfortable - for a prison cell. In one corner of the chamber was a full length mirror and Jen, who hadn't gotten a good look at herself since her change, approached it with hesitance.<br />
<br />
The first thing she noticed, now that she was alone, was the clicking of her changed feet on the tiled marble floor. Her feet hadn't changed that much. There was no fur on them like on the rest of her body and if anything, they had gotten a bit smaller and daintier. They looked very feminine and Jen would have even called them cute, if her new tiny toes weren't topped with sharp little claws that made the clicking sound on the ground. She realized that even though she was in a cellar and the floor was tiled, she didn't feel cold on her feet. When she took a look at the bottom of her feet, she saw that this was because they now had soft padding underneath them, like that of a cat. <br />
<br />
The second thing she noticed, was that her skin had started to itch where she had clothing on. It became so intense, she couldn't help but take her bra and panties of, even though she was now naked. As soon as she did, the itching stopped. And when she tried to put them on again, it started again. It was as if she was allergic to clothing now. That must have been what Kyle had her injected with. Jen felt like crying and started to sob, but first she took all her courage and decided to face the beast she had become.<br />
<br />
Jen took a look in the mirror and was shocked. The creature looking at her with green slitted eyes was a stranger to her. She was covered from her head to her ankle in light brown fur. Her nipples, hardened from the cold air in the room, where clearly poking through the fur around her enlarged breasts. Her hair was gone, replaced with soft, short fur, but she only had the hint of a muzzle, even though her teeth were very pronounced. Her nose was slightly upturned and she had whiskers on the side of her slightly puffy lips. She did look like a cat, but overall, she had to admit there was a certain beauty to what she had become. Where the change didn't add features of a cat, it had made her more feminine. Her dainty and delicate feet went up into long legs, shapelier than ever. Those legs tapered into a beautiful heart shaped ass with a long swishing tail in the small of her back. Her back seemed to be stuck in a slightly arched position now, as if she was sticking her but out all the time. Her waist was slim and her arms had an elegant grace to them, despite being furry. Her paws, that had looked to her so much bigger at first, were actually still quite slender, and like her feet, adorned with new claws and padding. Her breasts were larger and firmer, but not so much that they looked out of place on her slender frame...<br />
In an instant, Jen snapped out of it.<br />
&quot;What am I doing? Kyle has turned me into a freak and I admire his handywork. I need to get out of here!&quot;<br />
If she acted fast, maybe they wouldn't expect it, Jen thought, and made up a plan in her mind.<br />
She tried once more to get some clothes on, to no avail. Being able to wear clothes was something she could worry about after her escape. Confrontation was not something she considered now that she was forced to act so shy, but running she could try.<br />
<br />
<br />
She ducked behind the heavy wooden door and cried out:<br />
&quot;Guard! Uhm, Rob, is it? I don't feel so good, I think I need help&quot;<br />
<br />
The door opened: &quot;What do you-&quot;<br />
Before Rob had time to think, Jen with her new feline grace was out the door and halfway up the stairs, quickly sprinting towards the front door. <br />
<br />
In her head, Jen thought &quot;Please don't be locked, please don't be locked...!&quot;<br />
And the door opened. With a sigh of relief , Jen sprinted on with her feline speed down the driveway towards the big metal gate. Nobody seemed to follow her. &quot;Now If I can only get over that gate.&quot; She took all her new animal strength and jumped, already halfway up the gate and started to climb. Then she heard a quiet &quot;Thk&quot;-sound, felt a small stinging in her back, and the world went black.</p>
