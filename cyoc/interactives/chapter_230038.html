<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BAD END:<br />
You&#39;ve become a pregnant and fertile breeder. You have the body of a gray wolf, the breeding has left you mostly stuck on all fours. Although you can get up for up to 5 minutes and stand up fine, eventually the weight of your chest brings you down.<br />
Having been impregnated, your 8 previously flat nipples are now filling up with milk. Various hybrids are now linked via umbilical cord to your womb. Unfamilar with your new body, you sit, feeling them grow inside of your new body without any knowledge of what to do.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, your mates, wild or not, seem to take care of you, fetching you kills to eat. It&#39;s raw meat as you feel your stomach rumble, and some dandelion leaves and lettuce from a stag and deer met later. But your canine teeth snap through it, surprisingly strong and adapted to raw meat as you dine on the available vension, rabbit, and small game. <br />
<br />
Despite your previous human concerns, you find a sense of pride and belonging in your new life. Your wolf-pups grow within you, and with each movement, you feel a surge of love and protectiveness. You&#39;ve become a mother, a part of a pack, and your world has shifted to revolve around your family.<br />
The time comes for the young to be born. Your mates gather around you, guarding you and providing support as your body goes through the labor. The first pup is born, its cries echoing through the woods. One by one, the others follow, and soon, you have a litter of healthy, howling young. Howling wolf cubs, lounging lynxes, snarling lions, and a sweet little mountain lion baby. It&#39;s spotted pattern oddly cute as they look back you, golden and blue eyes gazing back.<br />
Your pack celebrates, their joy mingling with yours. You&#39;re no longer a human, but a transformed wolf, a mother, and a valued member of your pack. As you nurse your pups, their little mouths suckling at your now full breasts, you&#39;re caught up in alternations of embarrassment, flushed shame, warming pride. And then strange feelings as a cocktail of emotions swirl through you. <br />
You know you weren&#39;t supposed to end up like this. That it was a spur of bad luck, ill fate. Yet as the hormones flow through you, you smile, feeling contently and nuzzling your new pack. Maybe this wasn&#39;t how it was meant to be. But your pack would never let you go back now.<br />
<br />
As the pups grow stronger, the mating season returns with a vengeance. Your body, still tender from birthing, is once again the center of attention. The males, their needs unfulfilled for far too long, are eager to claim you once more.<br />
The lion, the largest and most dominant of the pack, moves first. His powerful body presses against yours, his hot breath on your neck as he nuzzles you. His cock, already throbbing and hard, brushes against your wolf-pussy. You feel a strange mix of fear and desire. The fear of what&#39;s to come, the desire to satisfy their needs and, perhaps, your own.<br />
He pushes inside you, the stretch of his large cock sending shivers down your spine. You whine softly, the pleasure and pain of his invasion a heady mix. The lion begins to thrust, his powerful strokes filling you completely.<br />
The lynx, unable to resist the scent of sex, moves to join in. His smaller, more agile body allows him to slip between the lion and you, his cock finding your swollen, red clit. He begins to lick and nip at it, the sensation sending jolts of electricity through your body.<br />
The wolves, a pair of them, join in, their tongues lapping at your breasts, their teeth gently tugging at your hardened nipples. You moan, the sensations overwhelming, as the lion&#39;s thrusts grow harder and faster.<br />
The cougar, the smallest of the males, positions himself behind you, his cock sliding into your now slick, wet snatch. You cry out, the feeling of being filled from both ends unlike anything you&#39;ve ever experienced.<br />
<br />
The mating lasts for hours, each male taking their turn, their cocks filling you and emptying themselves into your wolf-pussy. Your body shudders with each orgasm, your howls echoing through the woods. When the mating is finally over, you collapse, exhausted and satisfied, your body marked by their love, your pups nearby, watching with curious eyes.<br />
<br />
This is your new life. Bred over and over, breeding all the creatures that soon begin to assault and help conquer the land and other adventurers.. At times, you even are lucky enough to have one brought to you. Your former goal to help the land abandoned. As a adventurer you were a victim, but as a broodmother, you&#39;re able to control the changes of those your kin bring to you. Whether corrupting them into a willing or unwilling sire to suit your needs. <br />
<br />
Or unbirthing them and taking them within your pussy to rebirth them as a new child, connecting them into your womb and umbillical cord to convert them naturally into your gray wolf body.  Or having another &quot;suitor&quot; come to cum into you, and help &quot;overwrite&quot; their dna.<br />
<br />
When unbirthing, they trend to stay a larger size and are full size as they enter, but you can leech or even make them gain the ability to grow bigger if you want.. Set it so their former adult size, now becomes a 5-6 ft -> 7-20 foot high behemoth or king alpha size.<br />
<br />
You can control if they become feral or anthro or not, simply by subconsciously wishing for it. <br />
<br />
Due to the cursed nature of the rune. All your children are forced to bear heat or rut and instinctually breed with a suitable mate once of mature adulthood. The cursedly higher sex drives cause you to constantly seek to convert others, even in willing scenarios to match your cycles. and to match your heat..<br />
<br />
==== ENDING ====<br />
o You started off as a former human adventurer, but now have become a corrupted, fallen Andromorph (masculine body, pussy) Broodlord wolf. <br />
<br />
You due to your changes, have a Andromorph / Cunt Male&#39;s anatomy. Meaning when out of pregnancy. You revert into a powerful, lithe, animalistic cunning wolf, with slender body, yet thick, well toned muscle. Although spouting a dripping needy pussy, you find it easy to sprint and keep up with any prey. And due to your more muscled nature.. Can have a much easier tendency shoving in to unbirth / pressure or overpower physically weaker males.. <br />
<br />
Your hormones can also brainwash influence even previously dominant or submissive males to pant, lust drunk, victims to your subconscious desires to be dominated or be dominant. When your body is lust drunk and craves dominaton, it will pump in hormones to make them dominate you.. All your minds are often clouded, muddied with thoughts of escape fogging away.. As the desires to sate the instinctual cocktails flowing through you dominate.  <br />
<br />
The land itself, soon succumbs to a not so minor population of explosive population growth. The high litter rates and constant breeding makes it a struggle to avoid overpopulating despite the occasional slayer. A few escapees and stronger refugees avoid the infection.. But the weaker generation falls, as your kin and endless womb eventually helps infect or corrupt the land.. <br />
<br />
Your thoughts on who even cursed you forgotten as you enjoy your new position. As the Broodlord of the Wolf Woods.. <br />
<br />
As you hear your children howl into the sunset.. You smile, Knowing even under the visage of your &#39;12&#39; alpha sons and daughters.. All obey and follow your beck and call. The grown up children now even stronger than the 2 initial common wolves who had brought your infected corruption and downfall. <br />
<br />
Lust still gets the better of you however and from time to time, you birth a werelion alpha or werewolf from your muddied genes. While yours infections tend to be sexually inflicted or controlled bites and scratches. <br />
<br />
They still tend to be lust corrupted, breeding endlessly, without thought, and turning anyone infected into a mindless, eternally erect, savage, snarling, ever breeding mindless animal.. Oddly. Even with things much changed, you remain one of the only 2 people in the land who can seem to control them..</p>
