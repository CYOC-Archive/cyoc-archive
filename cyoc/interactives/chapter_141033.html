<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie smiled as she gazed at the two groups. Despite their obvious differences they seemed to be getting along rather well. The Samantha’s seemed to be talking about college Samantha’s pregnancy while the Claudia’s traded notes on their relationships with Mika. Even Mary Elise was getting along with the others, despite a firm lecture from Mika on transforming her fiance to stone. As Kellie now looked at her daughter she paused, Katie was waiting with Jennifer, Ashley, and Shiro.<br />
<br />
Kellie remembered the former enemies from before her fateful wish splintered reality. Jennifer and Ashley had unmercifully tormented her and Katie for their relationship while Shiro was utterly repulsed by Kellies lifestyle. Kellie clearly remembered how Shiro had spoken to her. At the time she was devastated, it wasn’t helped when Katie had transformed him into An elderly man before going a little power crazy. That had led to the girls fighting and Kellie eventually wishing Lisa and Katie out of existence. Kellie tried to shake those thoughts from her head, in Katie’s timeline she never did that. She shouldn’t hold a grudge against these three because of her actions, she needed to have an open mind.<br />
<br />
“Ms. O’Toole,” Shiro said tentatively. “It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Mitsuhiro Tozawa but everyone just calls me Shiro.”  Kellie looked tentatively at the young mans hand before shaking it. It seemed almost surreal that the angry and hateful young man she had meet briefly now seemed to have completely changed his ways. Unfortunately for Kellie her hesitant actions were immediately noticed by both Jen and Ashley.<br />
<br />
“Guessing Katie told you stories about us,” Ashley sighed turning towards Katie. “Geez Kat how many times do we have to apologize. We already know we were assholes in high school.”<br />
<br />
“No,” Kellie said quietly. “It’s..it’s not Katie’s fault. I’m, I’m just surprised that’s all. I have heard the stories true but you three seem, much different than what I thought.”<br />
<br />
“Well we kind of had a change of heart over time,” Jennifer said, squeezing Shiros hand tightly. “Yeah we weren’t the greatest people in high school but Katie kind of helped change our ways.”<br />
<br />
“Actually Jen you were the one that kind of changed me,” Shiro smiled. Jennifer blushed as she smiled shyly at her long time boyfriend. <br />
<br />
Kellie could only marvel at the group in front of her, the people she remembered seemed to have completely changed their ways. Looking at Katie she felt a bit of pride in knowing her daughter had such a positive affect on them.<br />
<br />
“So,” Ashley said. “How is this even possible? I mean Katie told us how but it just seems unreal.”<br />
<br />
“That and why did it take so long for you two to reconnect,” Jennifer added. “I mean didn’t you miss Katie?”<br />
<br />
“Oh I always missed Katie,” Kellie said. “But the thing is neither one of us even knew of the others existence until recently. I always assumed that we would never get the chance to reunite, that is until she happened to appear in my living room.”<br />
<br />
“So is it true then what Katie said,” Shiro asked. “That you exist in an alternate reality. One similar to ours but with a few changes.”<br />
<br />
“And one where your dad is is a legendary wizard,” Ashley added.<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled and nodded at the groups questions. “Yeah it’s true. As you can see in my world Katie’s friends are 16, like me. Theirs also versions of you three as well. In that reality Shiro is a junior and captain of the swim team.” Jennifer giggled as she looked at her boyfriend. “What,” Shiro said, frowning at his girlfriend. Jennifer now tried to suppress her laughter as she looked at her boyfriend. “Well it’s just, you can’t swim here hon,” she smirked. “I just find it funny that someone who can only dog paddle here is a champion swimmer in another reality.”<br />
<br />
Shiro frowned causing The group to giggle at his discomfort. “Well if it helps Shiro,” Kellie said quickly. “The guy I know is one of the most popular and likable guys at my school.” Shiro smiled as he turNed back to Jen, going his girlfriend a smug smile at how his alternate self was one of the Popular guys at school. As Kellie watched them she noticed Katie beckon her to the side. Excusing herself she now wondered what her daughter was going to ask her.<br />
<br />
“Everything okay their Kellie,” she asked.<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded looking back at the three before turning towards Katie once more. “Yeah,” she said quietly. “It’s just that...the three that I knew before....well...you know. They were just so, mean, vindictive. I never would of fathomed they would become friends of yours.”<br />
<br />
Katie smiled kindly as she placed a hand on Kellies shoulder. “True mom we had a bit of a rough start with those three,” she said. “But as time has gone by they’ve really changed. Even though they don’t have magical items of their own yet I can easily say they are some of the best people I know. I trust them as much as anyone of my friends. They changed a lot since high school and I know they care about us as much as we care about them.”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded as she now gazed at the group and smiled. Although things were much different than before she could say that things had turned out quite well for Katie. Hopefully over time Kellie and her friends would grow to be as close as Katie was with hers.</p>
