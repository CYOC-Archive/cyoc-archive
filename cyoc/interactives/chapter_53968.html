<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I'm not sure this will work,&quot; I said going over what General Hill had told me to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will work if you stick to the plan and don't slip up or double cross us,&quot; General Hill said. &quot;Remember that we'll make you a girl if you pull this off. Do you remember your story?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was shot while on patrol and I woke up as a prisoner here,&quot; I said thinking that they'd never buy it. &quot;Private Poore helped me to escape and she's my link to the inside of Venus base. They're not going to buy it. They believe that you don't take prisoners without changing them like they don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll just have to convince them that you escaped before we were able to change you,&quot; General Hill said.<br />
<br />
Just then a private came in saluting and said, &quot;We have a situation sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the situation Private King?&quot; General Hill asked returning the salute.<br />
<br />
&quot;A signal has been detected coming from this room,&quot; Private King said.<br />
<br />
General Hill looked right at me and asked, &quot;You did tell us about all of the tracking devices didn't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the ones that I knew about,&quot; I said running through all the ones I knew about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is the signal leaving the base?&quot; General Hill asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It appears to be,&quot; Private King said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why aren't the countermeasures taking care of it?&quot; General Hill asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's only transmitting in short bursts at irregular intervals and it looks like background static,&quot; Private King said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've heard rumors of a tracker like that,&quot; I said frowning. &quot;I didn't think it actually existed though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently it does,&quot; General Hill said. &quot;This calls for a change of plan. You'll be taken to a cell and hopefully they won't know that you weren't always in there.&quot; At that moment a klaxon sounded throughout the base. &quot;Sounds like that plan is scratched now,&quot; General Hill sighed. &quot;We can't get you to the cells without exposing you and having the plan work if you were serious about joining us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am serious about becoming a female,&quot; I said wondering if I'd be able to become a female now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you may have to fight then,&quot; General Hill said. &quot;Private King will take you to the line. Remember to use the stun rounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; I said saluting then followed Private King.<br />
<br />
We had just joined the line when Private King was hit. She instantly shrank and I cursed. They were using baby boy rounds. I took aim with the rifle I was supplied and squeezed off a few rounds. It looked like we were winning and then I was hit by a tracking round. As I regressed in age to a baby I was thinking how I now knew where the tracker was in me.<br />
<br />
The battle continued on around me for awhile. Finally it was over and the klaxon cut off. All around me I heard the females cheer in victory. One in the uniform for the Sisterhood picked me up and took me to the infirmary. I was placed in a growth chamber designed to slowly age me and change me into a female. The Brotherhood had the same thing for those changed into baby girls. It was done slowly so the body wouldn't be stressed any more than necessary.<br />
<br />
Over the course of about three hours my male genitals transformed into female genitals and I aged to six years old. Once I was able to move and talk I tried to get someone's attention but most were too busy with setting up for an evacuation since the base's location was compromised. Finally General Hill came in and I managed to get her attention. &quot;General Hill I know where the tracker is,&quot; I said. &quot;It's at the base of my neck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Private Plunkett?&quot; General Hill asked. I nodded my head and she turned to one of the doctors saying, &quot;I want her out of the growth chamber now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we take her out now she'll have to grow up the old fashioned way again,&quot; the doctor said. &quot;It would be too much stress on her body to stop the artificial growth and then resume it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She needs to have a little surgery done to remove a tracker,&quot; General Hill said. &quot;If it isn't removed before we move to the new base we'll have more males coming to transform us. Do I make myself clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfectly,&quot; the doctor said. &quot;I'll have to stop the artificial aging slowly to minimize the potential drama to her body. She'll be seven by the time she comes out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When she comes out make sure you get a 3-D x-ray of her whole body,&quot; General Hill said. &quot;I want to make sure that all possible trackers are removed from her body. Also we'll need to do the same with the prisoners.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't possibly x-ray them all and evacuate in the remaining time we have,&quot; the doctor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then do her first and start on the prisoners who were turned female during the fight,&quot; General Hill said. &quot;For the ones that you don't get to we'll just have to let them go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's ready to come out now,&quot; the doctor said. &quot;When any trackers are removed where do you want me to take her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring her to me,&quot; General Hill said. &quot;I'll find someplace for her after we get to the new base.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor nodded and after helping me out of the growth chamber led me to another room. In the center of the room was a table with a ring around it. I was told to lie on the table and the ring rotated around me. I was then led to a surgical room and I was put under.<br />
<br />
I woke up in some type of a vehicle with General Hill beside me. &quot;I see that you’re awake now Rachael,” she said with a frown. &quot;You had more trackers in you than the one we missed. We also found a small capsule which we believe contained a transforming agent. Our scientists think that it was designed to emit a gas through your pores that would transform us into baby boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why didn't they use it when they knew I was in your base?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The receiver was damaged,&quot; General Hill said. &quot;We don't know how it was damaged but we're lucky that it was. After it was removed from you I decided that there was a high probability that the prisoners had the same thing in them and the receivers probably weren't damaged so we sped up the evacuation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the prisoners?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had to leave them though don't worry about their well-being,&quot; General Hill said. &quot;We made sure that they would be able to make it back to their base so they'll be fine. Now lay back down until we get to the new base. I'll decide where to put you once we're there.&quot;<br />
<br />
I laid back down wondering if I was going to be put with someone or if I was going to be in a cell.</p>
