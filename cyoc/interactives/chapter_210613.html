<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now, donkeys don&#39;t typically sleep much more than 3 hours at a time. But Jeff slept standing up outside in some random farm field most of his first night. He was exhausted and as a result, slept well. Jeff also had the brain of a human, not a donkey. Well, it was partially a donkey&#39;s brain too, as it has built-in instincts. So he would need more sleep than is normal for donkeys and less than what is needed for humans. He would sleep about 4-5 hours a night. But this first night, he slept all the way through, he was so mentally exhausted.<br />
<br />
At the very early crack of dawn, just before the sun started rising, Jeff began to arouse from his slumber. He tried to stay asleep, for this was one crazy wild dream he was having. But slowly, he was waking up. <br />
<br />
Taking a yawn with a long &quot;hhhhaaaawwww!!,&quot; which he thought sounded wierd, he began to stretch his legs while standing up. Unknowingly doing so in a natural instinctual way. He thought he was in his bed and stretching his arms and legs. He thought he was stretching his hands and fingers. But of course, he wasn&#39;t. He was still equipped with hooves.<br />
<br />
He began to blearily open his eyes, as he wondered out loud about the time: &quot;haaaww heee hhaaww....&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; he thought. &quot;Haaaww!&quot; <br />
<br />
He tried opening his eyes some more, but they were awefully bleary. He wanted to rub them, but found he couldn&#39;t move his arms in that direction. Speaking of which....he was standing on....his.....legs....,!? His....FOUR legs...!!??<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww hhee..&quot; he tried saying &quot;what the fuck?&quot; But caught the strange noise he was making instead of words for the third time already.<br />
<br />
His dream! Of being stuck as a donkey! It came flying to his mind! Blinking his huge brown eyes several times as he couldn&#39;t seem to reach up to wipe them with his fingers, the world started coming into focus. He had a sort of a weird confusing vertigo. He thought he was lying down in bed. What he was seeing, did NOT match up with what his mind was thinking and feeling. His voice did NOT match up with the words he was trying to utter outloud to himself. <br />
<br />
Slowly, the world began to orient itself in his brain. He was in a field. What was he doing in a field....?<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. Oh...&quot; He thought next, as he saw clearly the flank, sides, and four legs with hooves extending behind him....<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww!&quot; He brayed one more time, as his body instinctuslly stretched itself for the second time. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a donkey!&quot; He thought to himself next as the events from the day before started playing out in his mind. &quot;I can&#39;t be! I can&#39;t still be a fucking donkey!&quot; <br />
<br />
But he was. <br />
<br />
The thing about a fetish, is that when your session of &quot;fun body-horror&quot; comes to an end, it comes to an end. You get to pick yourself up. Wash yourself off. And proceed with the rest of your day like a normal person. The dark thoughts pretty much disappear as you go about your daily life and only come at you in the dark of night or early morning as you rise.<br />
<br />
But not this time! Not for Jeff! He was STUCK in this dark fantasy! There was no &quot;walking away&quot; from himself! There wasn&#39;t even any cleaning himself up! He had slept in his own filth, or rather the filth of a disgusting dirty old donkey that had existed and ate god knows what before he had switched bodies with it.<br />
<br />
Hell, he could use his enhanced sense of smell on his overly large nasty muzzle and SMELL the drying donkey jizz all over his underside! He could see the gigantic donkey dick below him swaying with every movement! He could feel the giant black wobbly balls hanging just below his puckered black ass. He could see and feel the tail whipping around back there that wasn&#39;t quite adequate cover to hide his giant sagging black nuts! <br />
<br />
The view was making him ill at what he had become. &quot;No, no, no,<br />
nonononononoonooonooonooooooo!!&quot; as full realization set in. He wanted a shower, but was never going to get one. Not ever. He wanted to sit down for a good breakfast. All he has, is grass. He wanted to then play an hour or two on his computer. He would never touch one ever again!<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when it hit him. Some kind of robotic voice came suddenly inside his head:<br />
<br />
&quot;WARNING! Profile Jeff to be deleted. Profile Jeff has been swapped with a donkey. Deletion is irreversible. Do you wish to proceed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s heart skipped a beat as he stood there frozen. <br />
<br />
&quot;No-&quot; &quot;haaww-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! I can&#39;t fucking talk! No, don&#39;t delete that!&quot; He thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Profile Jeff has been deleted. Have a nice life, and thank you for using Chronivac 4.0. Goodbye!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooooooo!!!&quot; Jeff began to panic....<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeee hhaaww hhee hhaaww hhee hhaaww heee hhaaww...&quot; <br />
<br />
So there WAS a door cracked open, metaphorically speaking. He thought he was stuck permanantly as a donkey all along. As long as his profile was on that chronivac, someone could have used it to reverse the swap.....<br />
<br />
But now...now he was deleted! It was like the final closing of a door he didn&#39;t know was cracked open for his escape. Now the thought of his future stuck like this seems so much more real and much worse than it was before that voice told him what had happened! <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t....I don&#39;t want to be a donkey anymore...!&quot; He thought. He wanted to see his old body again. His hands. But he couldn&#39;t. Everywhere he looked with his eyes open, he could see at least some parts of a donkey&#39;s body that wasn&#39;t his. Usually most of it, through his wide binocular peripheral vision out of both of his big brown eyeballs. A view he would forever be stuck with. He could also feel the terrible stench of the grime wafting off this body that was now his. A smell and feeling he was also forever stuck with. A feeling of being and remaining forever filthy. His mouth tasted sour. The worst morning breath he&#39;s ever experienced. Jeff had no way of ever being able to brush those teeth. <br />
<br />
He began pawing at the ground with one of his big wide heavy blocks of a hoof. He was beginning his first full day as a donkey, thinking of being helplessly trapped in this state. Nobody ever knowing the identity of the human mind behind his large donkey eyes. As he began to paw at the ground, &quot;feeling&quot; the hard earth through his equally hard hooves, began to bray at it. Purposely trying to speak a word and while understanding he would never be able to feel anything with his hooves in the same way he did when he had hands. He could never even pick up a rock again.  <br />
<br />
Between his growing realization of what being actually stuck as a donkey on all four legs full-time meant and the finality of the voiceover inside his head, he started growing hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;God dammit!&quot; He thought to himself. &quot;This is exactly what got me into this situation to begin with!&quot; But try as he might, he couldn&#39;t ignore the intense sexual needs of a large virile male donkey. The more he tried to ignore that thing, the harder it got. The harder it got, the more he purposely began to act like the donkey he was. His dark fantasy was coming to light in his brain. Only now, he didn&#39;t have to pretend and imagine what it would be like to be a donkey. He actually WAS a donkey! <br />
<br />
&quot;Hee haw hee hhaaww hee hhaaww,&quot; he was braying.<br />
<br />
It keeps having to be said: he can&#39;t speak a single word, no matter how much or how hard he tries! All words are replaced with the hugely annoying, irritating donkey brays! The noise irritating even to his own big tall donkey ears. Even more so to him, as it denotes his complete inability to ever communicate with humans.<br />
<br />
This is also a driver for his sexuality. He &quot;liked&quot; the restrictions placed on him, even as it terrified him. The terror comes from his portending future due to his current inability to talk. The braying a prominent mark of the beast he had become and will have to live with for the rest of his life! Even after his sexual encounters. <br />
<br />
Every hour, every minute, every second of his life, he will have to live with this body. So while you&#39;re getting up to go to work, or to school, or to hang out with a friend&#39;s; living your daily life as a human, Jeff is completely stuck on all fours legs, trapped as a donkey. You may go about your life like normal, not even thinking about Jeff throughout your day. Everyday. But regardless, there he is. A donkey! <br />
<br />
Jeff had also thought about that as well. His total disconnection from the human world. Everyone going about their daily lives, as he will forever be stuck like this!<br />
<br />
It makes him hard. Really hard. He instinctually keeps wanting to use hands he doesn&#39;t have. He can only briefly bat at it with a clumsy hoof, before he has to catch himself with the leg so as not to fall over. Jeff brays put in frustration again, this time over being stuck to four legs with no hands. <br />
<br />
The site of his own body with his wide-set eyes is also inescapable. He can clearly see the malformed black hunk of smelly male meat attached to him, and that also constantly takes him by surprise. Everything about being stuck as a donkey is either merely an annoyance, gut-wrenching disgusting (like the big blocky plaque-filled teeth, donkey tongue and thick saliva, incontinence, and his gigantic shlong that he inherited from a real donkey) or outright terrifying (hooves instead of hands, being stuck to all fours, inability to ever speak again, and the giant gray-furred loaf shaped of his body.) His brays, apparently homosexuality (worse, being the &quot;bottom&quot; in homosexual encounters,) and HUGE ears crowning his thick skull, were humiliating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaaww heee hhaaww heee hhaaww,&quot; he continues braying, getting harder. What he&#39;s trying to say, is unknowable. All he can do is express his sheer frustration, disgust, and terror. &quot;Heee hhaaww heee hhaaww heee hhaaww!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff attracts the bigger male that had already raped him once. Jeff sees it coming, its own even larger black male monster bobbing up and down and wobbling around in a sinister way. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no,&quot; Jeff thinks. He wants to run away, but realizes he has lost control of his body! Did he lose control, or was he so mesmerized and enamored by the animal that had come sniffing up under him!? Either way, Jeff felt his tail rise in acceptance! <br />
<br />
A big dark cloud rose over Jeff both figurative and literally. The bigger jack, at close to 900 lbs vs. Jeff&#39;s own heft 750 lb frame, reared up.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no!&quot; he thought, trying to deny that he actually desired this. He could already feel his big round black hole (with a disgusting-lookimg prolapse!) tingling in anticipation. Down came the jack on Jeff&#39;s back. His sturdy frame able to hold up most of that 900 lb animal. <br />
<br />
His mate wrapped his forelegs around Jeff&#39;s middle, as he used his hind legs to scooth himself forward. Jeff was screaming in his own mind, but being greeted with brays instead. &quot;heee haaww hhee hhaaww hee hhaaww!&quot; He was braying over and over again in heavy anticipation. <br />
<br />
Finally, the huge black meat plunged into Jeff&#39;s waiting hole! Jeff wanted fervently to deny he wanted this, but did anyway! He wanted to run away at the same time that he wanted to push his rear end hard up against the incoming missile. His body opted to stiffen it&#39;s front legs, and push backwards against his mate! <br />
<br />
If Jeff were still human, tears would be coming to his eyes. Further and further, deep inside his poop shoot that big donkey dick plunged. It finally hit his prostrate, and it was electric! <br />
<br />
Both donkeys began braying in unison. One on top of the other. Jeff&#39;s human mind became completely lost in an explosion of colors and sensations. Again. But this time, his tingling body completely took over as it rammed backwards as his mate rammed forward, as a highly experienced homosexual bottom who knows how to have his prostrate poked imto. The combination of the two going back and forth, brought both donkeys into an explosion of pure ecstacy at the exact same time! <br />
<br />
Ropes of donkey cum exploded out of &quot;Jeff&#39;s&quot; inherited dick, while his anus was being filled with hot donkey cum that began to leak out of his torn ass. Jeff was unaware, except for a sort of pain emanating from his anus that was pulsing deep into his bowls, just how much more damage his inherited prolapsed anus was taking on. If Jeff thought his body stunk before, he&#39;ll be in for a ride awakening as the anus prolapsed even further and will now be stuck with a smelly slimy discharge and bloody stool. <br />
<br />
That doesn&#39;t matter in this very moment. He had reached absolute climax, and it lasted far longer and far more.powerful than anything he&#39;s ever experienced before! It last so long, and was so powerful, that for a moment Jeff&#39;s mind began to sort of worry. He didn&#39;t k ow what was wrong with him! But the intense trembling from his mate began to finally subside, just as Jeff&#39;s dick was beginning to do. His mate finally painfully slid out of Jeff, as Jeff &quot;Hawwwed!&quot; in both discomfort and satisfaction. His mate then just wandered away, and immediately forgot about the mate that was Jeff that he just creamed. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jeff was in an intense afterglow that left him reeling and exhausted. His human brain just used up a huge punt of energy, like an exploding atomic bomb, that he just basically passed out on all fours in the middle of that field. He fell so hard asleep, that drool was leaking from his mouth, even as his anus continued leaking the cum from his mate, and post-cum continued leaking from his incredibly sensitive tip that was the size of a beer can.....</p>
