<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin felt he had regained the upper hand. And he had, which infuriated Ty to no end! Ty has magic powers and still Dustin wins and gets away with being a jerk? No.<br />
<br />
With a silent wish that was more emotion than coherent thought, the scene that played out next was literally reality trying to come into alignment with Ty&#39;s will. Trying to put it into words to make it come to pass would have simply taken too long as this took all of roughly 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
Cody said, &quot;That was really mean dude, and uncalled for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie added, &quot;Yeah, it makes me feel really asham....ughed&quot;, it was at this precise second that whatever emotions he was feeling became too much for him. Seemingly in slow motion, a stream of cum rose up and delicately arched its way toward Dustin.<br />
<br />
Dustin saw this and his face twisted in horror and disgust, instinctively lurching backward and tripping on his football gear which he haphazardly threw on the floor. Falling backwards, he alarmed Cody and Jake, who stepped forward, but weren&#39;t fast enough to catch him, but the extra excitement made them go off like Charlie.<br />
<br />
Dustin fell backwards onto his bed and streams of cum arched their way onto his face and chest, each boy releasing 3 - 4 stream that just happened to hit Dustin without hitting anything else, their penises didn&#39;t even have dribble in the shaft.<br />
<br />
Dustin just laid on his bed with his eyes closed for a long number of seconds. His face slowly turned red, and his arms began trembling as he hadn&#39;t released his muscles yet. He was obviously filled with shock and disgust, maybe rage, probably embarrassment.<br />
<br />
With one eye, as the other was filled with cum, Dustin maneuvered himself off the bed, went to the door. opened it with a clawed hand (because moving his hand normally would engage his chest muscles and make the cum soaked shirt rub his chest more) and carefully walked to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Ty wished he could hear Dustin&#39;s thoughts and he could. &quot;Fucking kids, can&#39;t hold their God Damned Liquor, I&#39;m not their babysitter, I&#39;m not their father. Why the fuck do I have to take care of them. I should send them home.&quot; Ty wished to not hear Dustin&#39;s thoughts as he began contemplating a new punishment to unfold upon his brother...<br />
<br />
Ty made a few quick wishes, over the course of Dustin&#39;s shower, his age will double to 32, and the others will regress to 6, 3, and 1. Nobody but Ty will notice anything out of place. Dustin will think of himself as the father, Ty himself will regress to 10, and he will be the oldest brother.<br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s room became the master bedroom while his former room became the playroom and the middle children&#39;s bedroom, Ty kept his bedroom, the shower turned on and slowly things began to shift.<br />
<br />
Cody was chosen at random to become the 1 year old and after about 2 minutes he had already begun to shrink, becoming almost 2 years younger. In the shower Dustin had just reached 18 and the wallet in his jeans became 3 20 dollar bills, a debit and a credit card thicker. The other boys regressed a year.<br />
<br />
Another few minutes passed and Ty was changing the least was still around 14 and Jake was 12, on his way to 6. Charlie who was becoming three had already regressed to 10. All the boys were now prepubescent and shrinking in spurts like a slow reverse time lapse. Dustin on the other hand had teleported to the master bathroom and was continuing his shower vigorously cleansing himself, though he no longer recalled why he felt so thoroughly disgusting. Dustin had reached 21 and his physique had reached its prime, he was muscular and handsome, lean and full of energy.<br />
<br />
Another 5 minutes had passed, Cody was now 5, charlie was 8,  Jake was 10 and Ty was 12. In the bathroom Dustin had just had a baby when he was 22 and a year ago when he was 26, the restless nights had taken their toll and his eating habits were not the best with two little ones being his first priority.<br />
<br />
Ty was now the oldest and he wished himself visible while watching his younger brothers play together. Dustin&#39;s computer system devolved into a leap frog tablet, his computer chair became a house play set, his bed became a bunk bed and countless other things had changed and were still changing to accommodate 4 young boys. Posters of cheerleaders became Iron Man, the bean bag split into two child sized bags, his music collection became Kidz Bop music, and his monitor became a TV with a lil baby bum playlist streaming from youtube captivating Cody and Charlie.<br />
<br />
Although Ty was aware that this is not normal, it didn&#39;t stop the same mental changes from occurring in him same as the other boys and Dustin. It was impossible for Dustin to manage all of them 24/7. Ty was second in command.<br />
<br />
With only a few minutes at most Ty looked to Jake and told him to keep an eye on Charlie and Cody, as he bolted from the room. Ty raced downstairs and prepared a bottle of formula knowing that it was almost Cody, Charlie, and Jake&#39;s bedtimes and preparations need to be made. Ty went through the procedure to make a bottle of formula knowing it will be needed to put Cody down.<br />
<br />
Ty heard the shower stop as the microwave went off saying the bottle should be warm enough. He mixed the formula and raced up the stairs coming back to his brothers&#39; room. They haven&#39;t lit anything on fire... good.<br />
<br />
Ty grabbed Cody and began feeding him like his dad had showed him, within a few minutes, dad appeared at the door. looking exhausted from a long day of work, followed by dinner, and engaging with &quot;The Monsters&quot; as he lovingly called us.<br />
<br />
Ty marveled at how different Dustin looked, having two sets of memories. Years of fast food on the way home so he got to eat a meal for himself showed up as a de-toning layer of fat around his whole body. His face, neck, arms and especially his midsection. His questionable diet compounded the slowing of his metabolism from being over 30 and the rare nights out he got with is friends which probably contributed to the decent gut.<br />
<br />
Dustin stood in the doorway for a moment and just smiled as he watched his children being children. The youngest being taken care of by his oldest, the middle ones playing together nicely... a rare sight. <br />
<br />
He went through the routine of getting the little one down, then went to Charlie, then to Jake. Dustin had a little time with Ty at the end of the night and thanked him for always being such a big help with Cody and the other boys. Dustin said, &quot;Even though he wasn&#39;t ready to be a father when I had you, I wouldn&#39;t trade you for the world. You amaze me every day and I&#39;m so proud I get to be your dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s 10 year old brain took this in stride, he had always heard it and didn&#39;t yet realize what it meant to be a 22 year old with a kid. Ty&#39;s 15 year old brain had a complete meltdown as his existence was validated for the first time ever.</p>
