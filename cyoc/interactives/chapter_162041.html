<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the second round, John was determined to catch up to his brother. He was already years behind at this point, but there was plenty of time for things to change. He gathered up the dice, needing both hands to hold them, and dropped them on the table. He proceeded up the board, having to stand on his tip toes to reach across the board. As he landed on a plus space, John screeched with happiness. &quot;Yes! Making a comeback!&quot; he cried as +10 glowed inside of the black circle. <br />
<br />
Almost immediately, he encountered a large growth spurt that made him fall off his chair. As he lay on the floor, his body rapidly inflated into an awkward mix of gangly limbs and chubby body. His face was covered with grease and acne. To top it all off, a wispy moustache graced his upper lip. Sensing things were over, John clamoured back into his seat, his face flushed with embarrassment. Not from falling off his chair but from the raging boner he had as his teen hormones went into overdrive. Being 15 years old was a confusing time of life. It wasn&#39;t a graceful comeback, but John appreciated it all the same. &quot;At least I&#39;m not a toddler any more...&quot; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Next up was Paul, who frowned as he landed on a minus space. Luckily for him, the circle declared -3. Unluckily for him, he lost a significant amount of muscle mass, slimming down to a twink-like physique. Not only that, he lost all of his chest hair, plus the scruff that previously covered his face. With his geeky, round glasses and lack of any significant body hair, he looked younger than the 18 years old he&#39;d become, especially compared to Ellis. Paul pouted and slumped his elbows onto the table, chin resting in his hands. Now that he&#39;d had a taste of being a suave beefcake, he didn&#39;t appreciate losing it.<br />
<br />
Ellis was on a roll. He proceeded further up the board, and landed on another plus space. The symbol +7 came into existence. He grinned as he became the current oldest member of the gang at 25 years old. He had a final minor growth spurt, adding half an inch to his height, followed by a major weight gain as all his muscle groups pumped up. While his stomach stayed flat, his waistline still thickened as his core muscles expanded. His body hair increased tenfold, covering him with a dark rug of curls all over his torso. It crept up towards his shoulders, while stray hairs scattered across his upper back. His facial hair also grew denser, sprouting into a short, trimmed beard that hid any skin from view. The bulge in his jeans only seemed to get larger, giving him an aching need to relieve its pressure. His mind wandered to when his cousin taught him to jack off a few months ago when he caught him watching porn. Knowing he was nearly twice as old as his cousin almost made him cream his pants there and then. <br />
<br />
Managing some self-control, Ellis leaned back in his seat with his hands behind his head to expose his sweaty, furry armpits to the world. All that growth and body hair had left him with a manly odour that made the others gag. He smirked at their discomfort, sighing &quot;Ahhh, that&#39;s the smell of a real man...&quot;<br />
<br />
John chucked Ellis&#39; discarded shirt into his smug face and growled &quot;Do us all a favor and put it on!&quot; Paul picked up his own shirt and slipped it back on, not wanting to face his brother&#39;s wrath. It was significantly baggier on his slimmer body. Ellis, however glared at John and defiantly dropped his shirt to the side. What was he gonna do about it? Ellis had double the size and weight on the runt now.<br />
<br />
While John and Ellis silently fumed, Bob wasn&#39;t taken in by their show of masculinity. He held his breath as he rolled, fingers crossed that he wouldn&#39;t land on anything bad. He kept his breath held when he landed on a minus space, finally sighing as &quot;-4&quot; appeared in the circle. He lost all his gains from the previous round, reverting back to pre-puberty and a year younger than he used to be, now 9 years old. But that was a relief for Bob. So far the game had been kind to him. Maybe it could sense his unwillingness to change and was adapting for it.<br />
<br />
Finally, it was time for Jack&#39;s turn. He blew into his hand, shook the dice, and dropped them on the table. He fist-pumped the air at the high throw, pushing his piece straight into first place. However, he landed on a ? space. The mystery space. Anything could happen now.</p>
