<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door opened, and in came a man and a woman, &quot;We're home Kyle! I got off work early <br />
so I picked up your mother and--what the-&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle's father stared and Kyle's mother gasped as they saw the two large, tall, naked and <br />
furry wolfens standing in their living room and the slight hint of musk that filled the <br />
house. <br />
<br />
Jensen turned and took a step foreword. Kaylee on the other hand, moving faster than <br />
lightning ran up to her parents, leapt behind them -she was taller than both-, and without <br />
hesitation or wavering banged their head together, knocking both out cold.  she caught <br />
them both as they fell over unconscious.  <br />
<br />
She grinned at Jensen. <br />
<br />
&quot;That... was rather anti-climatic.&quot; Jensen noted. <br />
<br />
&quot;You were worried Master that a fight might get too many people's attention, and you <br />
implied that you might want them for our pack, so I couldn't exactly kill them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen himself, having created Kaylee out of Kyle, was still amazed at the eager yet calm <br />
way that Kaylee said the last part. He had said most of what he said before to Kyle about <br />
his parents mostly to scare him in his final moments as himself.   Jensen also realized, <br />
deep down, having been remade as one of the most classic villains of fairy tales, that he <br />
approved of her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you love your parents?&quot; Jensen asked carefully. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not nearly as much as I love you Master.&quot; Kaylee said carrying her parents to the coach, <br />
&quot;And if they happen to get in your way,&quot; She thought for a moment, &quot;Well if they do, then <br />
that's just too bad for them.&quot; She said with a ghost of human sympathy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Find something to tie them up and gag them.&quot; Jensen ordered, &quot;Then do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course my Master.&quot; Kaylee bowed happy to be of help to the Big Bad Wolf. Kaylee <br />
skipped into the kitchen's storage closet, and brought out a roll of industrial strength tape <br />
her father used when they couldn't afford a plumper.  Without a second thought she <br />
calmly tied up her still unconscious parents with it and then gagged them with a pair of <br />
napkins. <br />
<br />
Jensen looked at Kaylee's unconscious parents. 'Seems Kaylee's impulsiveness can -<br />
useful- sometimes.' Still he wished he had taken the time to remove some of Kyle's mental <br />
short coming when creating her. 'Could have, should have, didnd't.' At least she was loyal, <br />
effective, clever enough, and great fun to mate with. Also if his pack grew it meant he <br />
wouldn't have to rely on her for everything. <br />
<br />
A short while past as the two big bad wolves closed the drabs and locked most of the <br />
other doors. Jensen remembered how people hadn't treated him like he was anything <br />
THAT alien when he had strolled down the street (and no one had called the police about <br />
public nudity). But he didn't know how far the curse went, and didn't want to take chances.  <br />
Kaylee recounted how the police hadn't recognized her as a member of the house hold, so <br />
Jensen knew that the curse wasn't perfect in such regards. <br />
<br />
Kyle's parents still unconscious, the two wolves heard another car drive up. Both wolves <br />
looked outside. An old Ford Bronco drove up next to the car of Kyle's parents. The two <br />
front doors opened at the same time, and two figures semi-crawled out of the doors <br />
together. They had to lay on their stomaches and get the two back seats down in order the <br />
continue to drive after their transformation was complete (otherwise they'd hit the roof of <br />
the car), Fran had to drive on her elbows to give her large globes of maternal material <br />
space to breath. <br />
<br />
The two large she-wolfens that emerged were both dirty blond furred with blue eyes and <br />
had long hair to boot. Their large breasts pushing against each other as they strutted <br />
towards the house with soft slightly nervous smiles on their faces.  Anything either of them <br />
had been wearing was back in the Ford torn and discarded and forgotten. <br />
<br />
The two completely identical she wolves moved moved perfectly in sync, the wave of their <br />
arms, the pace of their steps and swish of their tails all mimicking the other flawlessly. The <br />
way they moved gave no hints they had ever been male. <br />
<br />
Jensen turned to Kaylee, looking very upset. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee!&quot; Jensen barked, startling the she-wolf, &quot;If you were going to create new pack <br />
members, I wanted to be able to -enjoy- it! If I couldn't see their bodies change I wanted <br />
to least observe their minds change like I watched yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee was caught off guard by her Master's unhappy attitude, &quot;I'm terribly sorry Master <br />
Jensen.&quot;Kaylee bowed lowly to the Big Bad Wolf, &quot;I'll do my best to make sure it doesn't <br />
happen again!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen thought about it. As Jennifer she had never once been attracted to girls, but now <br />
the idea of being with a man disgusted the Big Bad Wolf to no end. Maybe the original <br />
fictional Big Bad Wolf had liked lady wolves? It made sense.  <br />
<br />
Also the Big Bad Wolf realized, that while he'd have no problem with the Transform or <br />
Dare turning Kyle's parents into more loyal and devoted she-wolves, the idea of doing the <br />
same with his parents felt strangely and sickly wrong.  Oh not that he wasn't going to use <br />
the game to transform them and Martha, but having them as part of his pack as his mates <br />
just didn't feel right. Big Bad Wolf remembered all the times Jennifer's parents had treated <br />
her like a little kid, like she was still just a child on her first day of grade school... yes... <br />
that would be perfect, her parents would make a fine couple of werewolf cubs. He was <br />
already thinking of ways he could do this while letting them keep their smarts enough to <br />
have them take care of certain important legal and financial matters, Jensen giggled as he <br />
thought of the headlines, 'World's smartest pair of wolfen prodigy.' <br />
<br />
There was a ring at the door bell, and Jensen watching her from behind Kaylee opened the <br />
front door. <br />
<br />
The two tall blond wolf twins took one look at Kaylee, then took a look at Jensen. Then <br />
they took a ballerina bow with one arm up and the other down, their gesture reflecting <br />
each other like two sides of a mirror. <br />
<br />
They said together in identical echoing voices, &quot;Alpha female, we have returned as you <br />
have commanded. We present ourselves to the Master, we only hope that we meet with his <br />
approval.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alpha Female?&quot; Jensen growled lowly. <br />
<br />
The twins stay quiet and still getting out of the bow and standing at attention not <br />
interrupting the discussion between the alphas.  <br />
<br />
Kaylee looked worried and raised her hands, &quot;Master Jensen I'm sorry. I figured it would be <br />
much more practical than them constantly coming to you for every tiny little thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen sighed, admitting to her logic silently but not verbally, &quot;Kaylee, I just really really <br />
wish you had gotten my approval before you did this. You could have messed it up only a <br />
hundred ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee made a nervous laughed, &quot;But I didn't right my Master? And no harm no foul right?&quot; <br />
She then waltzed up to him and began to massage him between the legs. <br />
<br />
Jensen grinned with his muzzle, &quot;Heheheh, that's good dear, that's very good. But That'll <br />
have to wait until later. We don't want to get -more- people's attention. My family's estate <br />
is large enough that we can enjoy ourselves all we want and nobody will hear a thing. We'll <br />
have to wait until then.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Awwww.&quot; Kaylee said playfully clearly disappointed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry dear, I'll be able to enjoy you and your gifts soon enough.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Master.&quot; Kaylee nodded and bowed at the larger wolfen.  <br />
<br />
Jensen then looked at the twins. &quot;Come inside before someone sees you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; They said together and stepped inside and closed the door behind them. <br />
<br />
The twins stood perfectly still as Jensen looked them up and down, both twins twitched <br />
nervously, even this mirror each other. Each twin had the identical thought, 'I hope he likes <br />
this new me.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you scared?&quot; Jensen asked picking up their body language. <br />
<br />
&quot;A little Master.&quot; They said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
They bowed their heads slightly, &quot;I'm worried weather or not I meet with your approval.&quot; <br />
They echoed. <br />
<br />
Jensen laughed, then embraced the twins feeling their breasts against his chest, &quot;I totally <br />
approve of you, you are both very very lovely and I know you'll both be very useful to our <br />
pack!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Master.&quot; They said. <br />
<br />
Jensen pointed at himself, &quot;My name is Jensen by the way, entitled The Big Bad Wolf, I don't <br />
know if you knew about the game or not, but as you might have guessed, myself and my <br />
mate have used it to improve ourselves quite a bit, like you two have been obviously <br />
greatly improved.&quot;<br />
<br />
The twin clasped their hands in each other's grasp and made a tiny leap in the air, &quot;Oh <br />
thank you Master Jensen!&quot; They said. <br />
<br />
Jensen then asked logically, &quot;What are your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
They gestured at each other in turn, &quot;I'm/she's Darla, and I'm/she's Fran.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen admitted that their clone actions and voices was kinda weird, but on the OTHER <br />
hand, it filled him with such excitement and glee at the sense of DOMINANCE it gave him, <br />
something The Big Bad Wolf knew that as Jennifer she'd also have lapped up. Yes, this felt <br />
good. <br />
<br />
&quot;Darla come here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; Darla bowed speaking by herself and stepping close to her master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee wake up your parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At once master!&quot; Kaylee bowed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents?&quot; The twins echoed noticing the tied up humans for the first time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh they were likely going to cause some trouble so we took precautions.&quot; <br />
<br />
The twins perfectly and calmly accepted this.  The Big Bad Wolf then whispered in Darla's <br />
pointy ear. Fran tilted her head wondering what master was saying to her twin, this was <br />
actually just in case Kaylee's parents were faking being unconscious, her larger wolf ears <br />
barely able to pick up what was being said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now Darla, I want you to use the game of Transform or Dare on Kaylee's parents, once <br />
you do the game will transfer to them and it'll no longer be with you so you only get one <br />
shot, and this is this what I want you to say-&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee came back with a bucket of hot water and splashed it on her parents waking them <br />
up very very fast. Their eyes bulged as they tried to move and tried to scream and yell <br />
through the gags. their living room was full of humanoid wolf monsters. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi mom, hi dad.&quot; Said Kaylee coyly, &quot;I don't think I'll be finishing high school, seeing as <br />
I've gotten what's gonna be a lifetime position. One of my new friends however had a very <br />
important question to ask you.&quot; She leaned in close and said equally cheerfully, &quot;And don't <br />
you dare scream, or I'll break your arms and legs.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we should leave the gags on.&quot; Jensen said. <br />
<br />
Kaylee said, &quot;I'm not sure the game works if the person can't speak at all, I think there's a <br />
rule in the game that says that the game only works if the person is -able- to reply. I <br />
don't know if it's true, but until we have a large enough pack Master and a controlled <br />
environment we shouldn't risk breaking the rules of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How'd you learn that?&quot; Jensen asked. <br />
<br />
Kaylee smiled, &quot;I looked it up on the town official website, it was on this tinny little page <br />
buried underneath most of the site that seemed to be added as an afterthought.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen made a note to -look- at that web page. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now be good you two.&quot; Kaylee said taking off the gags. <br />
<br />
Darla came up to the parents and asked, &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unlike Frank and Daryl, Kyle's parents were both born and bred in Glendale, and being <br />
surrounded by monsters clearly victims of the curse they said together, &quot;Dare! Dare!&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla however, didn't miss a beat and repeated her master's instructions, &quot;You will both <br />
make whatever efficient and effective measures you can without leaving the house to get <br />
your finical and legal affairs in order in a realistic short amount of time. After which you'll <br />
call your employment and clubs and whatever and say that you're going to be taking a <br />
long long leave of absence and have no clue if ever you'll be back and do the same with <br />
any other family you might have. You will not leave the house unless our master Jensen <br />
gives direct and express approval first.  The master gives his direct and express approval <br />
that you'll then drive with us or for us to Master Jensen's family estate. You will drive <br />
carefully so as not to cause an accident, nor shall you do anything that'll rise suspicion in <br />
any shape or form. You shall also not reveal about the pack or the game. Once there, <br />
unless given new instruction by one of us to use the game on someone else, you will use <br />
the game of transform or dare on the parents of master Jansen's human self, Jennifer.&quot;<br />
<br />
'This beast was the girl who had laughed off at my son?' Kyle's mother thought, she <br />
wanted to ask... but felt Kayle's deceptively gentle feeling hands along her shoulder bones. <br />
<br />
Darla wasn't gone speaking, &quot;If they chose transform, you shall tell them they shall <br />
transform into nine year olds (human biological years) big bad wolf cubs of their respective <br />
genders. They will have hearts and minds of children but be cub prodigy smart enough to <br />
play the stock market and keep the estate and it's other holdings running and stable <br />
without being seen by the public and will do so with zeal and loving devotion to master <br />
Jensen and the rest of the pack and will use the game only to further the pack unless <br />
given permission by master Jensen.  It'll happen slow enough that master will be able to <br />
observe and enjoy their body changes and mind changes, but they will not be able to <br />
cause any trouble until their bodies and minds have finished changing. If they chose dare <br />
you will dare them to chose transform when next they play the game and to dare -you- to <br />
ask them transform or dare again, at which point you will use the above transformation. If <br />
they don't say anything and chose both, you order the above transformation, but also dare <br />
them to put their legal and economic affairs in order in a realistic short amount of time <br />
first to tie up any loose ends that might cause trouble for the pack staying at the estate in <br />
the long run.  ALSO, when someone asks you 'transform or dare' next, you will chose -<br />
transform.- Do you understand all of that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle's parents nodded almost robotic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee with her claws cut the tap holding Kyle parents. Not even speaking to the big bad <br />
wolves Kyle's father got on the phone and began calling his job followed by their closest <br />
family members while his wife began typing up e-mails to her bridge club and her own <br />
employment. <br />
<br />
&quot;How did I do master?&quot;  Darla asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes master how did she do?&quot; Fran asked. <br />
<br />
Jensen ruffled the she-wolf's long blond fur, &quot;You did wonderful Darla, you did absolutely <br />
wonderful!&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran hugged Darla who hugged back, their impressive maternal material squishing each <br />
other as their poses mirrored each other, &quot;You hear sister? I did wonderful!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I heard sister! You did wonderful!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee meanwhile not being able to enjoy her master right now sat back, relaxed, and <br />
watched her parents work as busy as bees enjoying every moment of it.</p>
