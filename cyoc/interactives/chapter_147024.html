<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Alternative Title: Exposition Dump Chapter #1</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">   There was a quiet pause as Issac watched with curiosity at Nix working. He was clearly engaged in his work, writing down with a strange red ink and neat legible lines almost everything he did. Issac tried to make sense of the various runic transcripts and inscriptions Nix wrote down but soon gave up. He was a paladin, trained in holy magics, he wouldn’t understand this arcane scripture. He could however recognize the immense influence of corruptive magic. Whatever research Nix was doing, Issac’s order would have him questioned and  executed immediately... but wouldn’t that be the same case for Issac? What did that mean concerning his place in the Order? <br />
<br />
   Issac pushed pass those thoughts and decided to focus back on Nix. Moving up beside him, looming over the short reptilian as he watched the kobold work from a closer angle. Regardless of what whether or not Nix dabbled in dark magics, Issac needed answers, and Nix was his only option.<br />
<br />
  “Nix, if I may-“ Issac began.<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, Nix held up a finger towards Issac, his other hand still writing down notes as he interrupted the paladin.<br />
<br />
“You are clearly new to this place and thus have many questions I presume, however, everything comes at a cost, what do you have to offer me?” Nix asked, a tiny mote of greed in his voice.<br />
<br />
“What? Then what about the semen you took from my cocks to use on your egg?” Issac asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, you never demanded payment, you gave it willingly, and clearly enjoyed the process. I doubt if I offered to milk them some more you’d even think of asking for payment.”<br />
<br />
  Although Issac could not physically blush due to his elemental form, his cocks did noticeably harden at the prospect, but he quickly tried to shut those thoughts down... with even greater difficulty than normal. For some reason, although his lust no longer affects his clarity of thought, its become harder and harder to suppress his instincts...<br />
<br />
“Fine... what do you want then?” Issac sighed.<br />
<br />
“Books. Tomes on arcane lore, the like, although nearly everything I need I have here, I’d rather not risk going upstairs into the library, so anything you have on your self I’d greatly take.” Nix explained.<br />
<br />
Thinking back, Issac had found several books on magical lore, things on purity and the corruption. He had been storing them alongside the Lexicon for quite a while now... how long it’s been since then, he was still quite human corrupted but still human...<br />
<br />
 “Yes..., I do have books you might be interested in, but in return you have to answer my every question, deal?” Issac asked.<br />
<br />
 “Every question within reason yes, now let me see those books.” He ordered, a impatient demanding tone in his voice.<br />
<br />
Issac chuckled, and willed the books from his body into his hand. He slightly regretted never taking the chance to read them, but he figured if he hadn’t read them by now he likely never would.<br />
<br />
   Nix watched with heavy interest as the books left his body, stone, vines, and armor twisting and shifting aside to make room for them to leave.<br />
<br />
“What incredible bodily control, have you always been able to do that?” Nix said, jaw gaping slightly as he looked on with awe.<br />
<br />
“Well, for a while yes.” Issac sheepishly answered, handing over the books to Nix who snapped out of his stupor and eagerly took the books with both hands, and began flipping through them, putting his original work aside.<br />
<br />
    Issac with a slight chuckle watched as the kobold throughly examined the small stack of books he had given the lizard. Inspecting everything, from signs of authorship, condition, age, the kobold took around seven minutes, in which he would ignore any of Issac’s questions or statements during that time.<br />
<br />
  When he was satisfied, he separated each book and placed them on a new different stack of organized books depending on their topic.<br />
<br />
  Sitting back onto his chair, he gave a satisfied “Hhmmp!” And looked back towards Issac.<br />
<br />
     “Giving them a quick glance those books were certainly rare and valuable but nothing worth preaching about. So then my magnificent guest, what questions do you have? I’ll answer anything I am able to!”<br />
<br />
 Issac gave a sigh of relief and quickly gave Nix a run down of what had happened, from his journey into the original Crypt of Calmach the Warlock, to meeting Ilvir, and their journey leading here. He left out several parts, such as his discovery of the Lexicon and the corruption transferring dagger, along with Issac’s main mission to destroy the source of the Corruption. <br />
<br />
  Nix listened attentively, only interrupting to ask questions or almost beggingly imploring Issac to give more details on the sexual parts of Issac’s story which Issac left out to save embarrassment. The way the kobold lustfully started asking, shifting around in his chair and visibly groping his protruding bulge made Issac almost give in but he shut down any requests of that nature.<br />
<br />
By the time Issac had finished explaining, Nic was caught up to speed on Issac’s story.<br />
<br />
“Well then, you are quite a paladin to have made it this far, from the surface to this place without a scratch and a body as beautifully corrupted as your own. I shall answer your questions, but before anything else I must explain to you what it means to be here, and what this place is.” Nix explained. <br />
<br />
“What is it?” Issac who, after getting Nix’s annoyed permission was sitting down on a large clearing he had made by carefully moving several of Nix’s research stacks away, questioned.<br />
<br />
“This place is the Athenaeum. It is the greatest repository of all magic, science, and philosophy, here the greatest minds learn secrets that could defile the balance of the heavens and the Otherworld, and where the weak whose denial of the truth leads them to ruin.” Nix calmly explained, making sure that every word sunk in.<br />
“This is a place of dark truths, and you being here means that it has sensed your desperate needs and has offered you a chance, be warned though, there is a reason why they say ignorance is bliss.”<br />
<br />
 Issac sat there for a moment, processing what Nix just told him. Somehow his words seemed to confuse him more than enlighten. Who made this place? What does Nix mean by having been offered a chance? What makes this information so important to know above all else? <br />
<br />
  Issac had a sinking suspicion that even if all those questions were to be answered now he would still be confuse, so he sighed and let Nix continue.<br />
<br />
 “There are three important things to know about this place. One, it is not a physical location, this world is not the one you came from, neither me or my colleagues really know where in the cosmic chart it is located, and we find the risk of learning is far too great. Though we do have some theories. For the most part we believe it to be a shard of the Otherworld that splintered off from the main whole to rest between the divide from the material and the Other. Understand...?”<br />
<br />
“Sort of?” <br />
<br />
“Good. Secondly, as you may have guessed, this is a place of great knowledge, practically every answer you wish for is here, but the greater the information you seek, the greater the danger, if you say, wanted to learn the secrets of divinity, well, I’d imagine you would have through trek through the deepest darkest places of this place, fighting off beasts that cannot be killed and evading traps that cannot be escaped from, all to know even the slightest glimmer of what you seek. Even if your sanity is intact by then, you may not like what you learn.”<br />
<br />
“I see... but then if it is such a great risk then why are you here?” Issac inquired.<br />
<br />
“Simple! To be here, you are either desperate, mad, or foolish enough to believe the risk is worth it!”<br />
<br />
“Then which one are you?”<br />
<br />
Nix pondered for a moment before answering “All three.”<br />
<br />
“I see... so what was the third thing?” <br />
<br />
“Oh thats quite simple, this place is a library, don’t make noise like your Ilvir friend did and the guardians of this place won’t come after you. After some research it seems like they tend to give newcomers a free pass for a while, but once their period of mercy is over, they come after you with full force.”<br />
<br />
 That made sense. There had been practically nothing attacking either Issac or Ilvir during their first few hours here, save for those shadow tendrils, but once that period of grace is over... they give no mercy to those who disturb this place’s quiet.<br />
<br />
Issac was about to ask another question when suddenly, Nix and Issac nearly instantly turned their heads towards the door as from outside they both heard what sounded like...</p>
