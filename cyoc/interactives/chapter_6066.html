<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It all started with an private message in chat. &quot;You want my physique?&quot;<br />
Bobby didnt know what to think. He had been working out for months and yet was jsut a skinnyguy. Bobby and Jim have been discussing fitness for some time. Jim ws large and out of shape with a bit of a belly, Bobby was on the other end of the scale, skinny and lean.<br />
No matter how each other tried, they couldnt improve their physical appearence<br />
<br />
One day while browsing weird shit online, Jim ran across a strange book on auction. Black spells for phiscial attraction.Improve your appearence.He thought it would be cool to go in his collection even if it didnt work. He used the buy it now option and got it for $18. Payed for it with online billing and sat back to wait.<br />
 Two Weeks later the book finally arrived at his doorstep.  Jim was very excited he didnt even noticed there was no return address on the envolope, just his info in a charcaol lettters. He ripped open the package and skimmed through the book. All sorts of weird withery type spells were in the pages. &quot;kewwwwwwwl&quot; he thought. He found a spell that struck his fancy. A sorta change weight with another spell. The first person who came to mind to try this with was Bobby. &quot;heheheh, wait til he gets aload of this &quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
 Jim waited til Bobby got online. When he saw his name pop up on the chat he frequented he private messaged him &quot; hey!.....You want my physique?&quot; Bobby typed in a series of smiley frowny gestures &quot;its not nice to tease dude&quot;.<br />
&quot;Aww who's teasing?..I just got this wicked ass book of spells and shit, thought you might want to try it out with me.&quot;<br />
&quot;You know that shit ain't real&quot; he replied. <br />
&quot;Wouldn't hurt to try now would it?&quot; Jim typed in with his bad typing skills. &quot;so wanna give it a whirl?&quot;<br />
Bobby hesitated for amoment. Jim has always had these hairbrain ideas, alot of the time just embarrasing the both of them., but some of them were rather fun &quot;sure, lets hit it&quot;<br />
&quot;ok dude meet here at 9, I gotta pick up some shit&quot;<br />
Jim scurried out the door and went to collect the ingrediaents the spell required. He made it back home just in time to see Bobby pulling into the driveway.<br />
&quot;Wahtt up dude?&quot; snickered Bobby as he watched Jim nearly fumble all the stuff he was carrying in his mad dash to the door.<br />
&quot;You know what up.&quot; , laughed Jim. &quot;now get your ass in there and help me with this shit&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside Jim was mxing the ingredients for the spell while Bobby watched form the couch.<br />
&quot;hey man this isnt going to be like another one of those fucked up acid trips are they?&quot;<br />
Jim looked back at Bobby &quot;heh, you didnt complain about that last time.&quot;<br />
&quot;yea, well i gotta work in the morning this time you know, I just want to know ahead of timeif i should call in sick&quot; he chuckled.<br />
Jim threw an empty wrapper at Bobby that he quickly dodged.<br />
&quot;Your still slow as ever&quot; Bobby laughed.<br />
Jim sneered, &quot;yeah, well thats wont be for long if this shit works&quot;.<br />
Jim had the ingredients all prepped he called over to Bobby. &quot;Dude c'mere&quot;<br />
Bobby walked over to the counter where Jim had the bowl of the brew &quot;yeah what up?...is it done&quot; <br />
Jim grabbed Bobby by the wrist and pricked his palm with a small needle, the blood trickled into the bowl.<br />
&quot;&quot;hahah, now it is. See im not as slow as you think&quot;<br />
Bobby pulled his hand back &quot;Bitch!, What was that for?&quot;<br />
&quot;Jim showed his own palm where he had pricked himself, &quot;part of the spell dumbass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim mixed in the blood of the tow with the brew then poured it into some shot glasses mixed with vodka. He handed one to Bobby. &quot;The vodkas my idea..Bottoms up skinny&quot;.<br />
The tow toasted and sished down the nasty concoction.<br />
&quot;ewww. that some sick tasting shit Jim&quot;<br />
&quot;heh, have you ever known me to make a *good* tasting drink?&quot;<br />
&quot;so now what?&quot;<br />
Jim thought for a moment, &quot; i guess now we wait, it didnt say how long&quot;.<br />
A couple of hours pass AS Jim and Bobby sit on the couch and watch a movie. Bobby checks his watch &quot;Dude , this shiot aint working and I gotta jet.&quot; <br />
&quot;Alright, but if you feel anything, give me a ring, even if its just trippin'&quot;, Jim grinned.<br />
<br />
Bobby headed home and Jim thought he mihgt as well pass out,.Maybe the vodka weakend the spell.,Maybe the book was bogus, oh well.<br />
<br />
<br />
The next day Jim was online chat again when Bobby popped on. <br />
&quot;yo, what up he typed?&quot;<br />
&quot;nothing,....and i mean NOTHING&quot; replied Bobby. &quot; no muscles, no weight gain not even body hair&quot;<br />
Jim took another look through the bookback to the spell he supposivley cast the night before. &quot;thats odd he though as he found that a page had been stuck togther. &quot;Heh go fig, the  activation  time&quot;. Just then He had an awful cramp in his stomach.<br />
On the other side of town Bobby was having the same pain. &quot;fuck! ,i think you gave me food poisong with that stupid shit&quot; he typed Bobby buckeld over as he was peering down he noticed his belly was filling out. He pulled himself back up into his chair. On the screen in the chat he saw that Jim was also having cramping, and that his mass was decreasing &quot;Dude! I think its working!&quot; Typed Jim.<br />
&quot;Yea but did it have to fucking hurt?!&quot; replied Bobby<br />
&quot;brb, im going to watch this shit in the mirror&quot; typed Jim<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea,l8tr&quot; replied Bobby<br />
<br />
Jim stripped down to his vboxers and stood in fornt of his full size mirror. He watched in awe as his belly and oversized legs seem to melt down intoa smalled leaner frame. His Arms and chest thinned and the hair on his chest seemed to receed. &quot;sweet&quot;, he though thenhe noticed his face at first the fat seem to melt away, but then, the shape of it changed as well. Slightly longer with higher cheekbones,. His hair once a thick brown had now lightened and shorted into an off blond. &quot;What the hell, I look like Bobby!&quot;<br />
<br />
ACross town Bobby's changes were completeing He stood in the bathroom mouth gaped open as his body expanded, his muscles grew as well as belly. His hair darked and lengthend some to a full brown. When the changes complete he was staring at the reflection of Jim in the mirror. &quot;oh...Fuck!&quot; he said aloud.<br />
<br />
He quickly scambled to the phone he had in his bedroom, apperently Jim had the same idea casue as soon as he touched it it rang.<br />
&quot;hello?&quot; Bobby asked in his now more husky voice.<br />
&quot;DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDE!&quot; came the reply from the other end of the line. A voice somewhat familar.<br />
&quot;Jim?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah dude..what the fuck?!&quot;<br />
&quot;how are we going to fix this?</p>
