<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luckily for Jen, schoolwork were of good use to her for once, as it distracted her from bringing other thoughts to mind. As her mother finished the last lesson at around three in the afternoon - a little later actually, thanks to the, *ahem*, delay - the teenager called her best friend over to hang out with. Her friend, Stacey, agreed, and was expected to arrive any minute now.<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang, as Jen finished the last of her mathematics homework. The languages would have to wait, because Stacey was here!<br />
<br />
She ran down the stairs, and unlocked the door with the keys that originally lay inside her coat. Through the glass of the door, she could see Stacey. Her expression was, odd. Considering what had happened this morning, it didn&#39;t come over as good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny!&quot; Stacey exclaimed, as she embraced her best friend in a tight hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stacey!&quot; Jennifer exclaimed just as loud, surprised by how tight her friend hugged her. &quot;I&#39;ve missed you!&quot;<br />
<br />
They stood there for a while, as Jen attempted to close the front door, while still clutched by her friend. She found Stacey to breathe heavily, and a hand ran down her shirt, and eventually underneath it, passionately caressing her skin. She never ever did that before. Jen realized where they were headed, and tried to stop it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stacey?&quot; She asked. She tried to slip out from underneath her tight hold, but her friend wouldn&#39;t let her.<br />
<br />
It turned worrisome as Stacey started to feel underneath her pants. *But so hot too*. Was she getting horny from this?<br />
<br />
Fingers rand down her spine, and over her crotch. While still in an embrace, Jen slowly let Stacey take away her rational thoughts. They slipped away so easily, it was crazy, unnatural!<br />
<br />
Jen was forced down onto the floor, as her friend passionately French-kissed her, while her right hand ran over Jen&#39;s crotch. It didn&#39;t take long before the girl brought her fingers to her friend&#39;s entrance, and eventually deep into it. At first, she did so in slow, sensual thrusts, but as the bestiality took over, it turned more fierce, rather vehement. All Jen could do was moan.<br />
<br />
But why would she have to be the only one to receive this pleasure? Why couldn&#39;t Stacey be rewarded. While continuously getting distracted by her own moans and the muscle spasms in her nether regions, Jen took her best efforts remove Stacey&#39;s blazer and unclip her bra. Her friend&#39;s large breasts and erected nipples came into full view, and her bestial tendencies stopped her from hesitating, as she took one in her mouth and inflicted a strong suction upon it. Stacey grit her teeth, as she too, now let out an amazing moan, followed by a growl, however feminine that could be.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was nearing her climax, and would, by a large margin, be the first to reach it. Stacey had unbuckled her belt and stripped her off of her pants and panties, practically fisting her whole. Never had something so large fit inside of Jen, that cucumber had also been a surprise, as she&#39;d reflected upon it afterwards. But the moans came and came. She clenched her teeth, while her juices covered Stacey&#39;s fist and part of her forearm. The pace of her breathing increased, and her muscles tensed and relaxed over and over again. She had her legs wide open, as Stacey furiously thrust her fist in and out of her best friend&#39;s pussy. Another loud moan escaped Jen&#39;s mouth, as she reached that day&#39;s second orgasm. Her pussy juices squirted out of her, multiple jets aimed right at her friend, as well as her own pants, as it became another mess on the floor.<br />
<br />
Her mind started to rationalize again, normal thoughts popping up, as her brain recovered from the occurrence. It began with thoughts like, *What is it with sex and floors today?* and ended with *Did I just masturbate with my own friend? A female friend at that?!*<br />
<br />
Her mind had reached the state of afterglow, so she was temporarily immune to any new potential bestial tendencies, thank god for that.<br />
<br />
Stacey, on the other hand, wasn&#39;t so fortunate, yet.<br />
<br />
Because all focus had turned towards Jen, she still wasn&#39;t relieved. &quot;Jen! Please!&quot; She cried out, as if crying for help. Still it was desperate, but Jen didn&#39;t want to handle it herself. Stacey&#39;s hand was now inside her own pussy, as Jen led her upstairs, towards the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strip naked.&quot; Jen ordered. &quot;Then get into the bathtub.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen ran out of the bathroom again and into her own room. She looked through some of her drawers, and eventually came across her sex toy. A large dildo, supposedly meant for such occasions, although she couldn&#39;t help but admit she&#39;d bought it before the curse was brought to life.<br />
<br />
She ran back towards Stacey again, and handed it to her. Stacey didn&#39;t give it a second thought and rammed it into herself.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to watch, Jen mentally excused herself and closed the bathroom door behind her. Inside her bedroom the moans were still audible, but they also eventually died down.<br />
<br />
Jen heard some more noise - Stacey went to the toilet for her after-orgasm piss - and then the door to her own room opened, with Stacey standing in the hallway, sex toy in hand. *ahem* &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
*What a curse.* Jennifer thought. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; She told her friend. &quot;Just put it in the open drawer of the nightstand next to my bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohohoh.&quot; Stacey grinned. &quot;Now I know where you keep your toys, Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll probably throw it away soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh. Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t help it.&quot; Jen said. *Nor can I.* The curse only lasted for a day right?<br />
<br />
____<br />
<br />
The evening went by in a flash, and Jen found herself laying in bed, falling asleep. It didn&#39;t take long for her to start dreaming.<br />
<br />
Tonight&#39;s dream was a lucid dream. Something she had never experienced before. She was completely aware that she was dreaming, although she didn&#39;t have complete control over it. It felt as if some kind of supernatural power maneuvered her through the dream. She was dreaming about the curse.<br />
<br />
It was as if a video was being played inside her head. At first, an introduction, in which her entire view showed three words: &#39;Pick a choice&#39;.<br />
<br />
Than a large number popped up, eventually sliding to the side of her view. Some kind of fragment was played in front of her.<br />
<br />
The fragment showed Jennifer sitting in front of her desk in her own room. It looked, and oddly, felt as if she was relieving herself, not caring about that she wasn&#39;t on the toilet whatsoever. The Jen in her dream looked down towards her crotch, and found it to be dry, while a large grin appeared on her face. The fragment ended there, and new text appeared in front of her.<br />
<br />
1. Letting loose:<br />
A physical change. You wake up and find that your left arm is detached from your torso. Trying to stick it back on, you find that it reattaches, but in its stead, your right arm pops off. Your body continuously lets go of a single body part, keeping it unattached from you. You are the only one affected by the changes. Reality won&#39;t adapt to the changes, meaning it&#39;d be better if you kept it a secret, somehow...<br />
<br />
Another fragment showed.<br />
<br />
This time it showed Jennifer awkwardly walking through the school halls, holding down her skirt by her hips, as if to hide something. The awkward walk was caused by some weird pleasure erupting from her nether regions. She found herself able to move some kind of new limb. The fragment ended there, and new text appeared in front of her.<br />
<br />
2. Cocktail:<br />
A physical change. No, not the beverage, rather, cocktail in a literal sense. You grow a tail, with a man&#39;s private part attached to the end of it. Quite the strange sight. It makes you wonder what you could do with it. You are the only one affected by the changes. Reality won&#39;t adapt to the changes, meaning it&#39;d be better if you kept it a secret, somehow...<br />
<br />
A third, probably the last fragment showed.<br />
<br />
It showed Jennifer laying on an uncomfortable bed in a room she wasn&#39;t familiar with. She stared at the ceiling, only to react to a door opening. She saw a naked man standing there, and launched herself towards him. The fragment ended there, and new text appeared in front of her.<br />
<br />
3. Sperm addict:<br />
A mental change. A backstory is already set. In this alternate reality, sperm, if taken orally, is considered an addictive drug one can&#39;t easily get clean from. Unfortunately, you&#39;ve had an encounter with this drug during your early teenage years, and the years that followed, you couldn&#39;t escape from those needs anymore. The changes can affect everyone, but reality will adapt in such a way that others are aware of the dangers.<br />
<br />
Once more, the same three words appeared in front of Jennifer in her dream.<br />
<br />
