<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Before we set off, I want to show you something. I still haven&#39;t accessed much of the alien&#39;s memories in my head, but I can see parts where he was absorbing body parts of creatures from other planets.&quot; Sheldon said with gleaming excitement. He was so engrossed with his new powers, that he didn&#39;t realize the ramifications of what he just said. The universe is thriving with life, and these memories inside his head prove the existence of alien life forms. This revelation seems so small now with the power Sheldon was going to show. &quot;I think I can absorb other people&#39;s body parts and use them as my own. It&#39;s like I&#39;m sculpting with flesh and bone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brain raised an eyebrow before settling to simply believe what Sheldon just said. It was useless being a skeptic after everything we saw. &quot;That&#39;s messed up, and kinda gross… in a sort of cool way. I know you know what I mean. You&#39;ve been my camp partner for the last five years. Anyway, care for a demonstration?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon grinned, undeterred. &quot;Watch and learn.&quot; He reached out with a tendril of slime, wrapping it around the thick, black strands of Bran&#39;s hair. Bran yelped in surprise as he felt the slime tugging at his scalp, but he didn&#39;t pull away. With a wet sucking sound, Sheldon&#39;s slime absorbed Bran&#39;s hair, the dark locks melting into his own body. Sheldon&#39;s hair receded until both of them were bald, but dark locks suddenly sprouted to replace Sheldon&#39;s brown. It bore the same color and volume as Bran&#39;s hair, but it clashed with his pale, freckled features.<br />
<br />
Bran burst out laughing, pointing at Sheldon&#39;s new &#39;do. &quot;Dude, you look like a dork! My hair does not work for you at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
In turn, Sheldon pointed at Bran&#39;s bare head. &quot;You have a lot of gall insulting this hair when you&#39;re bald. Somehow, being bald suits you better than this pigsty of a haircut.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a shrug, Sheldon plopped a handful of slime on Brandon&#39;s head and watched as hair returned to his scalp. He could absorb and return body parts without blood or pain just as the alien did in his memories. With his hair returned, Bran ran his fingers through it and breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Nice skills, freak.&quot; he said, giving Sheldon a playful punch on the arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I know the best person we could use this power on. We&#39;re both pissed at him, and I&#39;ve been dying to mess him up with these powers.&quot; Sheldon&#39;s face darkened as he thought of Preston Seville. The gay was everything Sheldon hated – arrogant, competitive, and always rubbing his &quot;achievements&quot; in everyone&#39;s faces. Barely anyone cared about the camp badges or competitions he won, but it was his personality after every win that grinds Sheldon&#39;s gears. &quot;Remember last year when he won the archery tournament and wouldn&#39;t stop bragging about it for weeks? And then he tripped me during the obstacle course, just because a nerd I was beating him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bran nodded, his expression souring. &quot;Oh man, I remember. And don&#39;t even get me started on the time he stole my sketchbook and drew crude pictures all over my art. What an asshole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should totally use my powers on him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bran&#39;s face lit up with a wide grin. &quot;It&#39;s finally time we get back at that fucker.&quot;<br />
<br />
With their target set, they waited until the sun began to set. Long shadows cast across the campground, and sounds from the forest overtook the camp&#39;s silence after dinner. They spotted Preston returning to his solo cabin, which was a perk from being a counselor&#39;s nephew. He had a room all to himself while Sheldon had to tolerate Bran&#39;s worsening teenage aroma. They followed the boy and hid in a cluster of bushes.<br />
<br />
Sheldon approached the back wall of the cabin and focused on his entire being. His limbs were the first to fall on the ground in a splash. They were soon followed by the rest of his body along with his clothes. The form congealed into one massive blob with a thin shimmering film that kept the dirt and debris out. Sheldon formed a tiny tendril to wave at Brandon and got a wave back. With that, he oozed through the cracks in the log cabin walls. The rough wood scraped against his gelatinous body, but they brought no pain or discomfort. Inside, he found Preston sprawled on his bed, thumbing away at his phone despite the camp&#39;s strict no-electronics policy. Learning more about his privilege perks only served to make Sheldon more angry. He had to bring books instead of his e-book reader for goodness sake!<br />
<br />
The arrogant jerk didn&#39;t even glance up as Sheldon crept closer, too absorbed in his own importance to notice the alien threat lurking in the shadows. Sheldon&#39;s heart raced with anticipation, the slime within him quivering with eagerness. Sheldon, being all slimy and stretchy, zoomed over and completely covered Preston in a surprise goopy attack. Preston&#39;s scream was muffled as Sheldon&#39;s slime poured into his mouth, nose, and ears, filling him from the inside out.<br />
<br />
The absorption from the inside out was quick and almost painless. Preston&#39;s body melted into Sheldon&#39;s slime form. He wasn&#39;t dead. His biomass, memories, and personality are safely tucked away inside Sheldon&#39;s being, and he could spit them out whenever he wanted. His nasty personality was of no use to Sheldon, while his memories were better suited for later. His body, however, was the crux of tonight&#39;s fun.<br />
<br />
Sheldon solidified back into his human shape, feeling Preston&#39;s essence swirling within him. With a wicked gleam in his eye, he opened the cabin door and gestured for Bran to enter. &quot;It&#39;s done,&quot; Sheldon said, his voice tinged with triumph. &quot;Preston is history. Well, part of me now, actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bran stepped into the cabin, his eyes wide as he took in the scene. &quot;Holy shit,&quot; he breathed. &quot;You really did it. You ate him. Did he taste good, at least?&quot;<br />
<br />
A smug smile crossed Sheldon&#39;s face. &quot;More like absorbed him. And it felt amazing. I can feel his memories, his thoughts, his very being pulsing through me. He didn&#39;t taste like anything, but having his personality inside my head is leaving a crappy taste in my mouth. He really loved hearing himself talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then talk like him. Use his voice and make him speak crappy stuff. Hell! Make him say I&#39;m gay and I want to be fucked in the ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon&#39;s eyes lit up at the suggestion. &quot;Oh man, that&#39;s perfect. Let&#39;s do it.&quot; He focused his thoughts, channeling the essence of Preston that now coursed through his veins. His voice shifted, deepening and taking on a cocky, arrogant tone. &quot;You know I&#39;ve always thought you were hot. Like, I wanna bend you over and show you what a real man feels like. Wanna be my bitch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck, man? I told you he should be the gay one, not me.&quot; Bran said, annoyed. &quot;Although… Hearing him say those things… I never thought I&#39;d say this but I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon burst out laughing, the sound unnaturally deep and gravelly coming from his transformed throat. &quot;Whoops, sorry dude. Guess I got a little carried away there. I&#39;m still getting a hang of this stuff, and I must have forgotten to close the lid on Preston&#39;s personality.&quot; He cleared his throat, his voice shifting back to normal. &quot;But you&#39;re right, that was kinda hot. Hearing Preston say those things with his own smug voice...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bran&#39;s cheeks flushed, a sheepish grin spreading across his face. &quot;Yeah, I know, right? It&#39;s so wrong, but... I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s kind of a turn-on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon nodded, his mind racing with possibilities. &quot;We could do so much more with this. For example...&quot; Sheldon pushed his goopy fingers on Brandon&#39;s crotch and did his magic. Bran felt cold tentacles wrap around his member, dissolving and adding mass until the weight and feeling were unrecognizable. It took a while for Sheldon to finish his work, and Bran was left moaning softly to himself by the end of it. He lowered his shorts slowly and his eyes widened in surprise.<br />
<br />
Sitting between Bran&#39;s legs wasn&#39;t his cock anymore. He stared down at his transformed genitals, his eyes wide with shock and a hint of excitement. The changes were drastic - his penis had grown several inches longer and thicker, the skin smoother and paler than before. A new foreskin covered the head, adding an unfamiliar sensation. &quot;Holy shit,&quot; Bran breathed, tentatively reaching down to touch his new member. &quot;It&#39;s so... different. Bigger. Better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon observed with a grin as his friend examined the changes. &quot;I told you, I can reshape flesh however I want. And Preston&#39;s body had some prime material to work with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Using the same prime material, Sheldon&#39;s head morphed into Preston&#39;s. His features shifted and settled into the arrogant jock&#39;s familiar visage. He smirked with Preston&#39;s cocky grin playing across his lips as he tapped into the memories flooding his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, before I absorbed Preston, he was getting off to some serious gay porn. And I assure you, they&#39;re way more hardcore than what you shared with me.&quot; Sheldon said, his voice dripping with Preston&#39;s affected drawl. &quot;Guess he wasn&#39;t as straight as he wanted everyone to think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bran&#39;s eyes widened, a mix of shock and curiosity crossing his face. &quot;No shit? Preston was into dudes? That&#39;s insane. That might explain why he&#39;s always focused on the two of us, the only gay kids in camp.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon agreed with Bran&#39;s sentiment. &quot;Oh, and to add more. I&#39;ve got his libido pumping through me. More like his overactive endocrine system pumping his more matured hormones into my smaller body. I can feel that desire, that need. It&#39;s fucking intense.&quot; Without warning, Sheldon dropped to his knees in front of Bran. He opened his mouth wide and took Bran&#39;s transformed cock into his mouth. His tongue swirled with growing familiarity to the member inside. Bran let out a low moan, his hips bucking forward involuntarily.<br />
<br />
Bran let out a low moan, his hips bucking forward involuntarily. &quot;Holy fuck, Preston... I mean, Sheldon... Shit, that feels amazing...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon hummed around Bran&#39;s dick, the vibrations sending shivers up his spine. He bobbed his head, taking more of Bran&#39;s length into his throat, relishing the taste and texture of his friend&#39;s altered flesh. In a way, Preston was sucking his own member.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah, take it,&quot; Bran groaned, his hands tangling in Sheldon&#39;s golden locks. &quot;Suck that dick, you gay little bitch. I know you want it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon pulled off with a lewd pop. A string of saliva connected his lips to Bran&#39;s cock. With a final poke of his stolen tongue, he grinned up at this friend. &quot;That&#39;s right, I&#39;m Preston, and I&#39;m your little gay bitch. I&#39;m going to suck your cock all night long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yes, you are. Gonna make you choke on this big dick.&quot; Sheldon dove back in, taking Bran&#39;s cock to the hilt, his nose pressed against Bran&#39;s pubic bone. He swallowed around the thick shaft, his throat muscles massaging Bran&#39;s length. A guttural moan escaped Bran&#39;s lips as he threw his head back. &quot;Holy shit, your mouth feels amazing. Suck that dick, Preston. Show me what a good little cocksucker you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon pulled off again, beads of saliva dripping from his chin. &quot;I love sucking cock,&quot; he purred, his voice taking on most of Preston&#39;s natural charming tune. &quot;I&#39;ve been dreaming about choking on your fat dick, Bran. That&#39;s why I bullied you. All this time, I only wanted to suck your fucking cock!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bran&#39;s hips snapped forward, driving his cock into Sheldon&#39;s waiting mouth. &quot;Fuck, you&#39;re such a dirty slut. Take it, take that cock like the whore you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room filled with the obscene sounds of wet sucking and filthy talk. Sheldon&#39;s head bobbed up and down, taking Bran&#39;s cock deeper with each passing second. Bran&#39;s breath came in ragged gasps, his abdomen clenching and unclenching as he fought off his impending orgasm. Fuck, I&#39;m gonna cum,&quot; he warned. &quot;I&#39;m gonna paint your fucking throat with my seed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do it,&quot; Sheldon urged, his voice muffled around Bran&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Bran took a sharp push in one final thrust. His cock buried deep in Sheldon&#39;s throat. Sheldon had to loosen his throat with his powers because of how thick that cock was against his constricting esophagus. Thick ropes of cum shot down, filling his mouth and spilling out around his stretched lips. Sheldon gulped and swallowed. Every drop served to satisfy their pleasures as well as the needs of his slime body. Even as they passed Bran&#39;s climax, Sheldon continued to milk it down to the last drop.<br />
<br />
Bran&#39;s body shook with the force of his climax, his eyes rolling back in his head as wave after wave of pleasure crashed over him. &quot;Holy shit,&quot; he panted. &quot;That was incredible. You&#39;re a certified cocksucker, Preston.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheldon pulled off with a gasp. Streaks of cum tainted the side of his perfect lips. &quot;He really was an amazing cocksucker. He always imagined sucking someone&#39;s cock after all that gay porn he watched.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both plopped on Preston&#39;s bed and wondered what they should do next.</p>
