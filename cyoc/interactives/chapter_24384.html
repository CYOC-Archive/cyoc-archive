<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time he got to cabin, he was pretty happy nothing overly bad happened on the way there.  Alot of people telling him to take a shower, but nothing else major. He could've sworn people rolled up their windows when he was driving there because of the smell. Well either way, he felt exhausted. He quickly fell down on his bed, and went to sleep.<br />
<br />
When he woke up, his face was once again nuzzled into his armpit.<br />
<br />
&quot; I really need to get out of that habit now...&quot; As he yawned, he felt something sticky on his lips. When he put his hand there, he quickly realized that smelly, green substance was all over his face. It was on his cheeks, his nose, his lips, some of it was even in his hair. He quickly puked into the trash, and ran into the shower. After he was done, he was thankful that that was all done and over with.  He quickly threw on a another t-shirt, emptied another can of AXE, and went to the nearby lake.<br />
<br />
When he got there, he rented out a boat.  When he finally got out to the middle of the lake, he began fishing. It was boring, but kept his mind off of things. After almost an hour of nothing, he dozed off again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh...&quot; When he woke up, he realized he finally caught a fish.  He reeled it in, but when it was right in front of him. He quickly slammed the boat...he was so stressed out. He needed to masturbate, it didn't matter whether or not anyone was looking. He quickly threw off his pants and shirt, and when he did, he screamed at the top of his lungs. Long, silky, white hair had enveloped his whole genital area. The scrotum, the penis, where his pubic hair was.  It even extended further than his old pubic hair did, it went at least a good 2 or 3&quot; onto his thighs on both sides, forming some sort of fur triangles.  However, as he felt a burning down there, he knew it wasn't over.<br />
<br />
He quickly it slowly get thicker and thicker, enveloping everything until he couldn't see his penis and balls at all. It was just a huge lump of white fur.  However, he then saw from the top a black striep extend down the middle of it. It was so long it was almost like a black and white fur loin cloth. But still, it was so thick, it created a huge, visible bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;This whole skunk thing is going a bit too far!&quot;  He quickly threw on his pants... he couldn't stand looking at that.  When he put them on, there was a VERY obvious bulge there. Way bigger than before. It even kind of sagged down it was so heavy and obvious. He realized he would soon need new pairs of pants...<br />
<br />
&quot; I've wanted a bulge...but not from this.&quot; His slow change to skunkdom pleasured him greatly, the sensual feelings he was getting from it were amazing. But he still wanted to stay human. He slowly rowed back to shore, headed to the town, grabbed a burger and fries, and ate alone in the woods.<br />
<br />
When he finally got back home, it was near 11, and he was tired again. As he stood in front of the mirror, ready to take a shower, he was the green had made a very obvious stain in his shirt. He'd have to buy darker shirts... but he did realize he was used to the smell by now. It even, in a way, caused him some pleasure. He got slowly hard as he realized how much he now loved the smell of his own man musk...<br />
<br />
When he undressed, he saw that the hair in both his armpits and his crotch area had grown once again. His armpit hair had gotten a good inch longer, and the same for his crotch. The amount was just abnormal. He did a quick sigh and jummped in the shower... and then went to sleep. He wasn't exactly looking forward to tomorrow's changes.<br />
<br />
He jumped awake in the middle of the night,a sharp stabbing pain in his penis forcing his mind to awake. He threw off his boxers, and looked in amazement. Under his pubic hair, he could see something slithering down. He felt a deep, aching, pulling sensation in that area, almost as if something was being pulled. He closed his eyes in pure ecstasy, realizing his dick and balls were getting bigger.  He just ignored everything else... living only for the feeling. However, as he felt it graze against his knee, he opened his eyes. It had gotten as thick as a beer can, and it was down to his knee. He quickly wished it could stop growing...and it did. He wanted to big, but not this much! He then watched in even more horror as the hair traveled down it, enveloping it all so he couldn't see any skin. He also realized his balls had gotten bigger, almost the size of small melons. Whenever he moved, they banged against his legs and caused some pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn...&quot; He got up and tried to walk, but could only move by VERY slowly shuffling his feet. He quickly layed back down on his bed and made a decision.  If this was happening...he was going to enjoy it. He quickly began masturbating, making long, long strokes down the shaft, lifting it up to his mouth and licking it, massaging it with his tounge. He even stuck it in his armpit, using the fluid as a lube. As he did so, he quickly reached climax.  The weight of his dick forced him flat down onto his bed, the 5&quot; wide head extending a little past his mouth. As he began to erupt, it sprayed all over his face, into his mouth and onto his cheeks. However, it didn't stop... it just kept on going. After almost five minutes, it stopped, but was now basically dripping down his chest. As he was about to pass out from pure ecstasy, he saw something extend from his crotch area... but he didn't have time to look before his mind blanked out.</p>
