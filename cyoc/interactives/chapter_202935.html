<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two days later, Officer Cooper was at his desk doing daily paperwork when Detective Warner came over to his desk looking disappointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning detective, something I can help you with?&quot; Officer Cooper asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come into my office Cooper, now.&quot; Detective Warner said as Officer Cooper followed behind him and sat down in the chair opposite his desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cooper, I&#39;ve always believed you were a good cop, but lately you&#39;ve had....moments where you seem to let the rules slide a little. A small brutality here, giving rough warnings to a few minor misdemeanors at most. But what I can&#39;t believe is that you had the gall to tamper with a crime scene.&quot; Warner said as Cooper began to look a little worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what? Warner, come on, you know I would never do that. I&#39;ve been giving my best to this force all these years and I would never in my life....&quot; Cooper began to say before being interrupted by Warner.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have confirmation from Officer Jenkins that she witnessed you deliberately tampering with evidence at the Pendragon location.&quot; Warner explained with Cooper looking shocked at what he had just said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I did nothing of the sort, what we found there was completely real!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was threatening a fellow officer&#39;s life for her silence real?!&quot; Detective Warner angrily asked as he stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Jenkins came in here yesterday to tell me that she not only witnessed you tampering with the evidence, but that when you saw her, you threatened her to keep her mouth shut about the whole thing. Now tell me, did you tamper with police evidence?&quot; Warner asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did, but Jenkins...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has decided to quit the force altogether.&quot; Warner explained as Cooper looked shocked by all this revelation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now turn in your badge and prepare for five years or more.&quot; Warner said as Cooper got out his badge slowly, but then went for his gun as Detective Warner tackled him to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Backup! Get me backup in here for this traitor!&quot; Warner shouted as two officers came in and grabbed him and hauled him away to a cell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenkins double crossed me! That bitch Jenkins double crossed me!&quot; Cooper shouted as he was taken away to a cell.<br />
<br />
***********************************************************<br />
<br />
Outside, the former Officer Jenkins was listening close by the police station and gave a slight chuckle as she heard her former partner plead for mercy. Jenkins was surprised the day before when she received a note telling her to have Cooper take the fall as she was to be rewarded for her service to the vampires. She waited a few minutes until a limo came driving up and a drive came up to the passenger door and opened it for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get in my dear, Donovan won&#39;t bite.&quot; A young female voice said to Jenkins as she sat down in the large limo as Donovan went back to the driver&#39;s side and began to drive away from the police station.<br />
<br />
Jenkins admired the inside of the limo, and was surprised to see an 18 year-old with beautiful auburn hair sitting across from her wearing a black body-con mini dress with a visible cleavage. Jenkins was slightly surprised to see a girl so young be a vampire. She offered her a glass of champagne which she accepted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenkins, isn&#39;t it? You&#39;ve done well allowing your former partner to take the fall for you.&quot; Cassidy said to Jenkins as she smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, but what if he...what if he says what happened?&quot; Jenkins asked with worry.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if he tells his superiors that he recently became a familiar to vampires and was only acting on their behalf? I&#39;m sure he&#39;d get a nice room in an insane asylum.&quot; Cassidy chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...I&#39;m....I&#39;ve been accepted to become a vampire to Lord Miro?&quot; Jenkins asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Miro is not the lord of the vampires. His son and heir, Lord Wyatt is the ruler of the vampires now and you&#39;d be wise to obey him....I&#39;m sorry, I only know you by last name.&quot; Cassidy apologized as she scooted closer in the limo as Jenkins began blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m named...that is my name...is Duchess. My mother just thought I looked as pretty as a duchess.&quot; Duchess Jenkins admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Duchess Jenkins...stay by my side and I&#39;ll show you all the wonders of the vampire community.&quot; Cassidy said as she bit into Duchess Jenkins neck as she felt the pain in her body for a few minutes but then it subsided and she felt her body transforming on the inside as she now looked at Cassidy and almost felt like she had a heart again as she seemed smitten with her Sire.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...what is your name?&quot; Duchess asked Cassidy.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name for many years has been Cassidy, but I&#39;ve been thinking about changing it. From now on, you shall call me, Cassandra, and I am your mistress. You may either refer to me as &#39;Mistress Cassandra&#39; or &#39;Mistress&#39;. Now we&#39;re headed to the airport. The states are not ours anymore and Lord Wyatt has other plans.&quot; Cassandra explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my Mistress.&quot; Duchess said as she laid her head down on Cassandra&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
***************************************************<br />
<br />
Lord Wyatt Tepes stood outside a backyard in the mansion that Miro had left to him. Wyatt looked around at all his surviving subjects and a few new additions that had been added such as Cassidy or Cassandra as she preferred to be called now, showing Jenkins around their new location. Wyatt smiled as he could hardly believe it, months ago he was only a lonely teenager at high school with barely any friends, now he was the lord of the vampires and had an entire legacy and vampires to lead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vampires old and new!&quot; Wyatt exclaimed getting everyone&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;My father Lord Miro&#39;s plans, unfortunately failed. But we had enough vampires survive the extermination from the wizards that we are going to be able to rebuild and build a better vampire future!&quot; Wyatt exclaimed as the other vampires cheered.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, we cannot ignore the events of the past few days. Wizards are dangerous and as of now, no vampire is to go after them for any reason. If I so much as hear a rumor that one of you is going after a wizard or any of their kids, you are dust.&quot; Wyatt threatened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why shouldn&#39;t we? Those wizards ruined our legacy and killed your father....maybe you aren&#39;t the leader we deserve.&quot; A middle age vampire man said as Wyatt nodded with a smile and nod then grabbed the vampire by his shirt collar and punch him hard in the nose before slamming the vampire&#39;s face into the pavement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any other objections?!&quot; Wyatt angrily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re....you&#39;re nothing but a....worthless little imposter....you weren&#39;t born into the Tepes line, you just got his blood in your body through some magic shit. You&#39;re nothing but a....&quot; The beaten up vampire suddenly felt a sharp pain in his back as he looked down to see something  push through his chest and come out the other side and saw what looked to be a child&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
The middle age vampire fell over and disappeared in dust as everyone looked to see the murderous little Ann and half of her body still reforming with her right side still had bones and barely any flesh on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann, welcome back. I&#39;m so glad to see you here.&quot; Wyatt said as he walked over to her as Ann kneeled in front Wyatt.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is what worse is for you all if you disobey me. Right little Ann?&quot; Wyatt asked her as little Ann&#39;s partially reformed face gave off a disgusting smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;All hail Lord Wyatt!&quot; A shout came behind that was from Duchess Jenkins. &quot;All hail Lord Wyatt! All hail Lord Wyatt!&quot; the other vampires chanted as Wyatt looked around and smiled at his new home.<br />
<br />
&quot;My lord?&quot; Kyra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my lady?&quot; Wyatt asked Kyra.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think the Tepes line will continue with all three of us.&quot; Kyra said as she patted her stomach. Wyatt knew what this meant and realized what bargain Kyra had made with Sasha back at the castle.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s good to be Lord of the Vampires.&quot; Wyatt said as he smiled.</p>
