<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric pulled out his phone and dialed a number. “Hi, Dr. Patel? Eric here. Listen, I have a friend who seems to be having the same issue as me. Yes, that’s it. About nine inches. Oh. Oh, I see. Okay. I’ll tell him.”<br />
<br />
He hung up and turned to Chase, who was dancing nervously on his feet. <br />
<br />
“He’s in Mumbai right now. He’ll be back this week and could see you first thing Tuesday morning.”<br />
<br />
Chase sighed in frustration. “I guess that’ll have to do,” he said bitterly. “Hope I don’t shrink away to nothing.”<br />
<br />
Trigger said, “You know what we should do? We should go to the gym.”<br />
<br />
“Are you insane?” said Chase. “Like this? And let people see me?”<br />
<br />
“You can’t hide forever,” said the big bodybuilder as he ruffled Chase’s hair. “We can go to the one over in Sorrento Valley, nobody goes there except soccer moms.”<br />
<br />
Chase shrugged and went to change. Trigger followed him into the room. <br />
<br />
“You know,” he said as Chase took off the ridiculously large clothes, “you’re not actually any less hot this way.” He walked up to Chase and caught the back of his head with his big, calloused hands, then bent down and kissed him deeply. <br />
<br />
Chase was caught in a whirlwind of different sensations. Immense attraction to this large and attractive muscle bear; thrilling to the feeling of Trigger’s rough three-day stubble on his face; the unsettling sensation of having to lean up to kiss someone; the growing insistence of his erection. <br />
<br />
Trigger pulled back from the French kiss and stroked Chase’s beard. “Let’s play before we go,” he whispered. Chase’s burgeoning libido made the decision for him, and he pulled Trigger close, lifted the bigger man’s shirts and kissed his nipple. Trigger drew his finger along the small of Chase’s back and he moaned involuntarily. <br />
<br />
The door opened. “What’s going on in here?” asked Eric as Chase went to work on Trigger’s chest. Eric was hugely turned on watching the two bigger men go at it, so much so that he didn’t realize he was rubbing his tented pants until Trigger said, “Eric, come join us. Service Chase.”<br />
<br />
Eric didn’t have to be told twice. He immediately pulled down Chase’s loose pants and got to work. <br />
<br />
“Chase,” Trigger’s voice cut across. “You service me.”<br />
<br />
Chase was about to protest—he was always the dom, never a sub—but Trigger drew himself up so as to make clear that he was the alpha in the room, and yanked his own basketball shorts down, exposing his medium-sized rod. Chase looked at it, realizing that his smaller mouth and hands would make it seem gigantic. Trigger started working on Eric’s small cock, not wanting the little man to feel left out. <br />
<br />
After a little while, Trigger started to tense up and Chase knew he was close. Just as Trigger hit his climax, Eric started to jerk, but Chase felt a familiar dull headache and jerked back as Eric continued his work. <br />
<br />
“Eric… don’t, dont! Stop! ERIC!” <br />
<br />
But it was too late. Eric had been edging Chase for too long and Chase came with a fury. As soon as the orgasm subsided, he grabbed his head with one hand and his butt with the other and ran lopsidedly into the bathroom. Trigger ran after him. Eric grunted with frustration as a flurry of sounds emanated from the closed room: moans, followed by not one, not two, but five flushes of the toilet. There was a brief delay and then a sixth flush, followed by the sound of the sink running and muffled crying. <br />
<br />
“Open this door,” ordered Eric. “What the hell is wrong with you?”<br />
<br />
“Go away,” moaned Chase. “Just leave.”<br />
<br />
“No,” said Eric. “I think I know what happened, but you need to come out here. Now.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck you,” whispered Chase. The bathroom door opened and Trigger and Chase came out… but it wasn’t the same Chase. Eric stared as Trigger pulled Chase close. The former fitness model’s head came up to Trigger’s collarbone. Trigger pulled Eric into the group hug and Eric noticed he came up to Chase’s chin. <br />
<br />
The group separated. “Let me see,” said Trigger. “Eric, you know Chase’s body. What do you think?”<br />
<br />
“I think… besides being shorter, he’s not as big as he was. I remember his biceps and chest being huge for his height.”<br />
<br />
They forced Chase to get on the scale and wrapped around him with the tape measure. “Five foot three and a half, 148 pounds, 36” chest, 28” waist, 14” biceps.”<br />
<br />
Chase cried softly. “What is happening to me? Why am I getting smaller? And why am I still so horny? All I can think about is sex. And we just finished three-way oral. Oh… oh Jesus.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” said Eric. Chase ran into the bathroom. The other two listened intently as the sounds of Chase pleasuring himself were heard through the door… followed by other noises, and the sink again, with more crying. <br />
<br />
Trigger rolled his eyes and slipped a credit card into the door jamb, releasing the lock. Chase whirled around and moaned, “It’s speeding up. I’m losing my muscles. I’m losing everything.”<br />
<br />
They stared. Where an hour ago there had been a muscle-bound, hairy bodybuilder of average height, was now a tiny manlet with just above average aesthetics. And, strangely, his beard and chest hair had retracted. <br />
<br />
Eric walked slowly up to him and realized with a shock that Chase was only a few inches taller than him. Just then, Eric doubled over in pain and fell down, writhing. Trigger ran to get his phone but by the time he came back, Eric was sitting up and rubbing his legs urgently. <br />
<br />
“You okay?”<br />
<br />
“I think so,” said Eric. “All of a sudden there was just fire in every part of my body and I keeled over and passed out.” He stuck his hand up and Chase grabbed it to help him up, but something was wrong. Eric’s hand didn’t feel right in Chase’s. As Eric steadied himself, Chase realized with horror that he was looking UP at Eric!<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!” screamed Chase. “How? He’s like five inches taller than me!”<br />
<br />
“It’s because you sucked him off. And he sucked me off but he started having the spurt and I finished on his chest.”<br />
<br />
“That’s ridiculous,” said Eric. <br />
<br />
“More ridiculous than changing bodies overnight? Look at him! He’s a midget twunk! Look at yourself, you fuckin’ furry meatball. You didn’t have chest hair when I came I—oh no!!”<br />
<br />
Trigger ran into the bathroom and started banging on the counter! “No! No! Ow! OW! Shit! What the fuck! I barely tasted any!”<br />
<br />
Chase looked worriedly up at Eric. <br />
<br />
Trigger walked out of the bathroom. “AUGH!” he screamed as he bashed his head on the lintel. <br />
<br />
“Well, now we know what’s going on,” said Eric quietly. And the three men stood in a group and held each other: Trigger, now 7’3”… Eric, now 5’9” and looking Trig in the chest… and Chase, the former bodybuilder and fitness model, now 4’7” and slender, and looking slightly up at Trigger’s navel.</p>
