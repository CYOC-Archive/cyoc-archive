<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The new Coach Ryerson continued to stroke his shaft, the tip of his cock oozing out cum. The original Coach got down on his knees and placed the tip of the other Coach&#39;s dick in his mouth, hungrily swallowing his seed. It was incredibly hot to be able to suck on his own cock; Coach had always fantasized about making love to himself, but he had never thought it a possibility before today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck, that&#39;s so hot,&quot; The new Coach grinned at the original Coach as he stood back up. He ogled his clone lustfully, taking in his handsome face, beefy bod and gargantuan cock. Coach had always known he was a good looking man, but being able to admire himself up close and personal was providing a newfound appreciation for his own sexiness. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you say we take this to the showers?&quot; The original Coach asked, raising his eyebrows seductively and running his hands along the new Coach&#39;s cum covered chest. He raised his fingers to his lips and slowly licked up the semen, never breaking eye contact with his twin. &quot;I think we need to clean you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two Coaches made their way from the locker room area of the changeroom to the showers, both men still completely nude and rock hard. The Coach trailing behind had his eyes fixated on his duplicate&#39;s rear end, watching as his round ass bounced with every step he took. He wanted nothing more to shove his raging boner up that hole and fuck himself. The two Coaches were so fixated on each other&#39;s bodies and the impending sex they were going to have that they neglected to notice that the discarded jockstrap had been left on one of the locker room benches.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Assistant Coach Travis was finishing up his lesson plans for the following week in the office he shared with Coach Ryerson. He had been working with the older man for most of the school year, and the two got along swimmingly. Ryerson had even advocated for Travis to get a full time teaching position with the School Board. Travis saved the plans and shut down his laptop, standing up from the small desk he had been seated behind. He was in his early thirties, with wavy bleach blonde hair and a killer body that would make a model jealous. He followed a strict diet and was on a daily workout regimen, treating his body like the temple that it was.<br />
<br />
Travis headed for the changeroom, glancing at his watch and surprised to see how late it was. On a Friday evening, he was most likely the only one still in the school. He was dressed in a pair of black gym shorts and a navy blue workout shirt, but he always packed a change of clothes since he didn&#39;t like being sweaty on his long commute home.<br />
<br />
Travis pulled open the door to the changeroom, surprised to hear the sound of the showers running. There was no after school practice on Fridays, so there was no reason for anyone to be hitting the showers at this time. He was going to go investigate when he noticed a jockstrap sitting on one of the locker room&#39;s benches. For some strange reason, Travis found himself drawn towards the jockstrap. He picked it up and found it wet to the touch; it appeared to be drenched in semen, obviously having been recently used. Travis&#39; first instinct was to throw the jockstrap out, but he was reluctant to part with it. To the contrary, he felt the strong urge to try the jockstrap on.<br />
<br />
After a moment of hesitation, Travis found the urge too strong to deny. He reasoned that there was no harm in just quickly trying the jockstrap on. He quickly stripped out of his clothes and slid off his boxers, leaving the young man naked. Trembling in excitement, Travis hurriedly pulled the jockstrap up his legs and over his 5 inch flaccid cock and balls. He pulled open one of the lockers and checked himself out in the mirror, flexing his massive biceps. He had to admit, the jock looked good on him. And it made him feel really good.<br />
<br />
Travis felt a sudden pulse of energy engulf him, radiating out from the jockstrap. The feeling of power enveloping him was so strong that he nearly lost his footing, stumbling forward and supporting himself on the row of lockers in front of him. He glanced at his reflection and was surprised to see that he was getting shorter! Travis was 6&#39;5, but he now looked closer to 6&#39;3 and was still shrinking, settling in at a new height of 6&#39;1. Before he even had a chance to react, Travis noticed that his muscles were starting to shrink as well. Travis&#39; massive veiny biceps and broad pecs were dwindling away before his very eyes. His thick tree trunk thighs and muscled calves were slimming down as well while his tight ass was starting to plump up and round out. Travis still had a muscled and defined bod, but it was a fraction of the size he had been mere seconds ago.<br />
<br />
As Travis was checking out his new body, he began to swell up once again, but this time with fat instead of muscle. He watched in a mixture of lust and despair as a soft padding of fat grew atop his muscles, taking away some of his definition. His pecs bulged forwards and drooped ever so slightly as he packed on additional pounds, while he found his chiseled six pack abs smoothing over before growing into a round little muscle gut. The light treasure trail of curly blonde hair on his chest thickened and darkened as it spread to cover his pecs and stomach. Similar dark brown hairs sprouted from his legs and arms, which had been previously smooth.<br />
<br />
The tingling sensation focused in around Travis&#39; groin, and Travis moaned in pleasure as he felt his member start to harden. His cock grew rock hard and then grew thicker and longer, settling in at a new length of 11 inches. Travis&#39; balls swelled to the size of oranges as his pubic hair grew darker and coarser. The feeling of euphoria was too much for Travis and he felt his dick erupt in cum, his semen mixing with the cum that the jock was already drenched in. He took a quick look at his reflection and was surprised to see that his face no longer looked like him; in fact, he was starting to resemble Coach Ryerson. Travis&#39; facial features continued to shift as he aged and his curly blonde hair grew straighter, shortening into a dark brown crew cut with streaks of silver.<br />
<br />
Coach Ryerson looked around for a moment in confusion, unsure of where he was or how he had gotten there. He looked down at the cum soaked jockstrap he was wearing, slowly starting to realize what must have happened. He wondered who he had been mere moments ago before putting on the jockstrap before noticing Travis&#39; discarded clothes on the changeroom floor. Ryerson felt a quick pang of regret; Travis had a killer bod, and he had been hoping to seduce his Assistant Coach before changing him.<br />
<br />
Ryerson walked towards the shower room, hearing the sound of the water running. He paused in entry way, seeing two Coaches nude and soaking wet making out and thrusting their boners against one another underneath one of the shower heads. The newest Ryerson slipped off his jockstrap and cleared his throat loudly to catch the attention of the other two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys, got room for one more?&quot; He asked with a wink, stroking his own hard on.</p>
