<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erika was relieved when Cole showed no sign of having heard her loud moan from the bedroom. He did seem a bit flustered though.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been a couple hours, I can feel the pressure building&quot; he said awkwardly. &quot;I should head back home before things get any worse. Anyway we can&#39;t be seen together, my sister would find it suspicious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erika nodded, and Cole took the diary with him before leaving. Erika hid the  canine salve under her bed in case her mom would barge into her room while she was gone.<br />
<br />
After Cole left her house for Melissa&#39;s, Erika prepared her stuff for the night ahead - her toothbrush and sleeping bag of course, more clean clothes, but also her dog&#39;s bowl and some kibble. She couldn&#39;t leave her husky alone all weekend and Melissa had offered she take him with her.<br />
<br />
Once Erika arrived at Melissa&#39;s house, her friend ran to her on the doorstep and hugged her tightly. Her wavy dark hair was tied in a pony tail and she wore a two pieces bathing suit that emphasized her curves; it was rather obvious her breasts and hips would outgrow the outfit in the near future. <br />
<br />
&quot;So glad to have you back! What took you so long? Wait, I know exactly...&quot; Melissa said in a mischevious voice. Erika turned red, thinking about the naughty exchange they had over phone texts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll set up Max in the backyard if that&#39;s alright with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa giggled a little. &quot;Okay sure. The others are already there, getting ready to hit the pool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Erika let Max loose in the backyard and set up his water bowl and kibble, before removing her dress and joining her friends near the pool, where everyone was already in swimming apparel.<br />
<br />
Melissa had invited Riley and Emily, as well as Riley&#39;s best friend Piper. They were almost thirteen, save for Emily which was the same age as Erika. Erika found herself staring at them for a moment, like she would caught herself staring at Melissa recently.<br />
<br />
Riley had dark brown eyes and an olive complexion, curly black hair worn lose over her shoulders. She had a tall and slightly toned build, being an aspiring athlete. Piper was almost as tall as her and quite thin, wearing short blond pixie hair; her eyes were green and mischevious and she was the most outgoing of them all. Emily on the other hand was very short and shy, and still retained childish features, having developped almost no breasts contrary to her other friends. She had a fair complexion with freckles, and straight short auburn hair cut in a bob with loose bangs over her grey eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Erika, look at you! What a growth spurt!&quot; Piper joked, refering to Erika&#39;s curves barely contained in her old one-piece suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, don&#39;t mention it! I really have to go shopping sometimes next week to get new clothes...&quot; Erika replied embarassingly.<br />
<br />
All of them giggled, and Melissa even gave her a discreet wink, making her blush a little. She felt a little light-headed and fuzzy from looking at her friends&#39; bodies. Hormones were so inconvenient sometimes... She even found herself checking out Emily&#39;s AA cups, in spite of the swimming top laying almost flat on her pale freckled chest.<br />
<br />
Erika cleared her throat. &quot;I need to go to the bathroom before hitting the pool, I&#39;ll be back in a minute&quot; she said to excuse herself, turning back to the house in a rush.<br />
<br />
There was no way she would remain calm long enough in this context. However she wasn&#39;t yet in condition to produce any goo, which she would drink to maintain a human appearance longer. Unless she went to Cole for help, perhaps. The idea sounded repulsive  to her at first, but she already felt slightly turned on just being around her friends.<br />
<br />
In the house, she headed straight to Cole&#39;s bedroom, knocking on the door. There was a shuffling sound inside, but no answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cole, it&#39;s me, Erika! I need your help for  something...&quot;<br />
<br />
Still no answer. Erika put her hand on the door handle. &quot;It&#39;s kinda urgent, I&#39;m coming in!&quot; she said, pushing forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t..!&quot; Cole yelped in a high-pitched voice.<br />
<br />
The door closed behind Erika as she stepped in, surprising Cole as he was grabbing a t-shirt to cover his naked self. Erika had almost forgotten that Cole must have been due for sexual release, so she had probably caught him right after his jerking session...<br />
<br />
Except Cole looked strange. In fact, his body hair was totally gone, and his body looked like a curvy hourglass figure, with ample breasts jiggling as he was trying to hide them with a piece of clothing. Between his legs, no penis was in sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;... you ingested your cum, didn&#39;t you&quot; Erika said with a sigh, facepalming.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said it would deter the effects of the salve! You never mentioned it enhanced female features, and it wasn&#39;t in what we salvaged from the diary either&quot; Cole protested in a girly voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now you know. Fortunately for you, the effects are not permanent, but you&#39;d better stay in your room for the next 12 hours or so! You can&#39;t be seen like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole blushed and looked down, squirming in embarassment. The air still smelled of sex, and Erika felt a faint pull of lust in her guts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean it, Cole! The goo increases sex drive so you can&#39;t be left around my friends, especially not as this transformation would freak everyone out, Melissa first of all. Stay in your room until you&#39;re no longer female!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Erika was a little upset. There went her only chance to get goo before her own condition would worsen. She was also unsettled by the sight of a female Cole - the similarity with his sister Melissa was striking, from the shape of his face to that of his feminine curves. He even had the same slight tummy chub showing between his wide hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was it you wanted anyway, Erika?&quot; Cole asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just... I... Actually I wanted to warn you about this before it was too late. Nevermind then. And put on some clothes to hide your body before anyone else comes here!&quot;</p>
