<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As expected, Jake&#39;s new-found powers had very little influence on his boss&#39;s attitude towards tardiness. After a half-hour of getting chewed out and 7 hours of punishment-dressed-as-busywork, Jake was ready to be anywhere but here. He decided to ride out the last half-hour of work by feigning stomach problems and checking twitter on his phone in the bathroom.<br />
<br />
He locked the door and took out his phone. 13 new messages. 2 from an increasingly concerned Josh about &quot;the thing we talked about&quot; getting worse and 11 from an increasingly horny Katie wanting an encore of last night. Her last message was a photo of her, still at work, flashing the camera with a caption &quot;I showed you mine. Now show me yours. ;)&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s cock pumped to life in an instant. Between her massive tits and obvious desire for more of last night, Jake&#39;s cock practically ripped itself out of his Jeans springing to life. He fumbled for a moment as he pulled out his cock, still not used to its new weight. <br />
<br />
&quot;A good problem to have,&quot; Jake thought with a smirk.<br />
<br />
After a few moments of positioning and a few blurry failures, he finally got a photo he was proud of and was about to send it to Katie. Then, it hit him: it had been more than 24 hours since his last personal &quot;alteration&quot;. He greedily tapped on the &quot;^&quot;, zipping past 8, 9, 10... <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! If I do too much too soon, she&#39;ll know something is wrong. I can&#39;t have her know I&#39;ve been changing my dick size -- she might even think I was always that little acorn nub she felt at the movies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cutting off his panicked thoughts, he made a plan: once a week, he&#39;d bump it up by an eighth or quarter of an inch. Well, obviously except today. There was no harm in rounding his cock to a nice even 8 inches. He could claim that he was only half-mast when she measured him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously, I am going to have her measure me again tonight.&quot; A devilish smile went across his face as he thought about his size-queen girlfriend&#39;s reaction to 7.5 inches, and how much he could make her squeal with 8.<br />
<br />
He entered his new size into the watch, snapped another photo and sent it off with the caption: &quot;you&#39;ve awoken the beast. You better be ready to tame it tonight. ;)&quot;<br />
<br />
She replied instantly: &quot;Holy shit. It&#39;s even bigger than I remember. I need you. I need you right now.&quot;<br />
Jake wasn&#39;t sure what made him harder: his girlfriend&#39;s obvious desire for him, or the obvious power shift that came with it. Already, he was planning on how best to bring up a three-way and which women at work he thought could keep an occasional fling quiet enough for Katie to look the other way. Just the idea of the possibilities was enough to put him on the edge. He didn&#39;t even realize that he&#39;d started stroking his cock!<br />
<br />
Snapping out of it, he decided to play around with the watch&#39;s settings menu for a bit before replying. There were all kinds of vaguely-worded options that he would obviously have to play with later. But for now, it was time to return to the more important subject: getting laid tonight.<br />
<br />
Jake: &quot;go home. leave the door unlocked, get undressed and wait for me on the bed.&quot;<br />
Katie: &quot;Are you coming over now?&quot;<br />
Jake: &quot;I will be there when I want to. No more questions.&quot;<br />
Katie: &quot;mmm... I like this side of you. Where was this man hiding?&quot;<br />
Jake: &quot;that&#39;s a question. There will be consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
There will be consequences? Jake wasn&#39;t sure who was taking over his typing, but it felt like a totally new man writing these messages. He liked this feeling. He pulled up his trousers and headed back into the bullpen with an obvious-and-massive erection straining the fabric. His coworkers, unconsciously intimidated by his massive cock, left him alone. Though, with a bit of time and distracting thoughts, Jake was able to calm the riot in his pants.<br />
<br />
Needing to kill  a little more time at work, his attention returned to the watch&#39;s settings. What could it hurt to get more familiar with the device? Among some of the more direct and tame options, there was a &quot;units&quot; option. Giggling at the &quot;unit&quot; joke on a penis-changing magical watch, Jake clicked on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Current: Standard English Units&quot;<br />
<br />
Using the  &quot;^&quot; and &quot;v&quot; buttons, he could choose all sorts of other measurement units. He wasn&#39;t really a science or math nerd, so most of them sounded absolutely made up to him. Although, he was kind of curious how big his dick was in metric units. Purely for scientific purposes, of course. He highlighted the &quot;metric&quot; option and pressed &quot;enter.&quot;<br />
<br />
The now-familiar tingling of the watch&#39;s magic thrummed across and throughout Jake&#39;s penis as the watch read: &quot;calibrating... calibrating...&quot;<br />
<br />
Odd, he thought, that it would need to interact with his penis like that just to change the unit reading. <br />
Though, the slight breeze across his groin was both a new and pleasant finish to the procedure. Odder still was the fact that the main screen still registered his penis as &quot;8.00&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t tell me this thing is broken!&quot; Jake whined, completely forgetting the several small-scale miracles the device had already granted.<br />
<br />
As 5 o&#39;clock finally came, Jake bolted to the exit. As he raced to his car, he could feel his erection bouncing back to life with each step. Bouncing? No, a cock like his didn&#39;t have room to bounce around in his  pants. Still, those words were the perfect sensation. Inside the car, he fished out his phone from his bag and was rewarded with a stream of messages from Katie that quickly escalated from flirty little lingerie photos to a video of her &quot;warming up&quot; for him with a dildo. It was obviously smaller than his mighty 8 inches (or however many centimeters that is. damn broken watch), but still his stomach gave a slight lurch as he was filled with a slight sense of inadequacy. Some old feelings died hard, he guessed. But there was a quick remedy to that.<br />
<br />
Jake decided to give Katie a little treat for her behavior and reached in his pants to fish out his monster cock for one more dick pic. His hand fished around his pants, feeling around for the trouser snake, but to Jake&#39;s horror, it instead plucked out a little worm. There in his hand was not the 8&quot; monster that he last remembered seeing. It wasn&#39;t even his original 5.5&quot;. Resting easily in his palm with room to spare was his dick, or what little remained of it. It was a little (very little) over three inches. <br />
<br />
A horrible realization crossed over Jake as he reached over to his phone and shakily asked :&quot;how many inches are in 8 centimeters?&quot;<br />
Result: &quot;About 3.15 inches&quot;<br />
Why, his mind screamed at him, why didn&#39;t I just ask my phone instead of fucking with a magic fucking watch?!<br />
In a mix of horror and curiosity, Jake asked something that he immediately regretted: &quot;How many centimeters in 8 inches?&quot;<br />
Result: &quot;About 20.32 centimeters.&quot;<br />
The bottom of his stomach dropped out. In one simple click, he had shrunk his penis to less than half its size! Worse: it was smaller than what he had started with! Again!</p>
