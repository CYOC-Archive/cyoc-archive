<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now that he had the full version Max was ready to    Move on to his next transformation. Overall max was happy with the initial  change he made to himself now he was more interested in changing his life. Max wasn’t destitute he wasn’t really even broke, but he definitely was not well-off, and he figured it was right about time he changed that. He thought for a good while on how he could change his life to minimize the unforeseen impacts. <br />
<br />
After a long bit of thinking he came up with a brilliant idea. He loved streamers, streaming was an fun way to work, at least he thought so. They were basically payed to play video games. There was one major problem however, the thought of putting himself out there like that terrified him. Fortunately the app had just the feature to help him get over his fears.<br />
<br />
The  app had a sub menu under awareness called mental adjustments, according to the guide this would make subtle changes to him and add memories to help him cope with the new reality. The idea was a bit disconcerting but if he was about to make himself a pro streamer what good would it do him if he immediately lost all of his followers. The guide did specify that the option would keep all his previous memories intact so he figured worst case scenario he can find a way to reverse the changes he made. Max backed out of the room and began to generate sentences with his office as the target. After a few sentences he found what he was looking for. <br />
<br />
‘Max runs his business out of this office.’ <br />
<br />
Max hoped this would work, using simple sentences to modify reality left much to be desired, but he couldn’t complain the alternative was not changing reality. Reading the guide he found the interpretations were not random they were relative to the comprehension of the user. So he figured he would get at least close to what he was hoping for. The sentence now read ‘Max runs his stream out of this office.’ Max hesitated with his hand above the accept button, and his anxiety ramped up as he continued to hesitate. After a solid minute of hesitation he closed his eyes and hit the button. <br />
<br />
 He slowly released a breath While opening an eye slightly, and was shocked to find everything had changed. He had expected some kind of indication that it happened  but there was none it happened instantaneously. The changes were clearly evident. The whole room had noise cancelling foam on the walls. The sitting desk where he normally worked was now a high-end  standing desk and he had what appeared to be two 4k monitors. There was a mike hanging from a boom arm along with a mounted HD camera. The most drastic change however was his computer, his computer was no slouch before but upon close inspection this machine was worth no less than $4000 dollars. <br />
<br />
“This is great!” He cheered looking around the room further behind his desk on the back wall he had his sponsor table where he had some cans of some low popularity energy drink. Thats when he started to go through all his memories. He was making money streaming and from what he knew he enjoyed his job, streaming was never about the money after all. Max wasn’t a super popular streamer but he had loyal followers and had a gradual uptick in viewers, but he made roughly the same streaming as he did in his previous IT business had earned him. He realized in this reality he never had an IT business but that was beside the point. “The grass is always greener.” He sighed, but at-least now he would have more fun with his job. And so he got ready for his next stream he would be playing through some indie plat-former that his fans recommended.<br />
<br />
The stream went on for 2 hours before he called it. He was surprised he felt perfectly  natural with all of his fans watching he even set a new personal record for the size of his live audience. He was going through his profiles and older videos and just trying to get a better understanding of his new life despite the change made to make him adapt everything still felt new. It was then that he started seeing numerous shitty comments and articles about himself. Every youtuber, streamer, or celebrity has to overcome these kinds of things but to him it was all fresh and new as was the damage it caused. He spent the rest of his evening balled up in a chair in the corner of his stream room sobbing where nobody could hear him.</p>
