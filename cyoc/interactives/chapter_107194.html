<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack Johnson was in his office just across the street for the town’s court. It being a Saturday, court rarely was in session; but that didn’t stop Johnson from his duties. Jack Johnson was the town’s prosecutor; a onetime candidate for the last mayoral election, he lost to Martin Stovall, partly due to the fact that he made an offhand comment that his backer Benton Knight took exception too.<br />
<br />
Jack Johnson bared no ill will towards Martin Stovall; he won the election fair and square. Which is why it stung him to find out that Martin’s daughter was arrested for assaulting two students last Tuesday during lunch. Finding out that Julie also came close to violating the town’s statue 1A* with one of the students she was charged with attacking was something he dreaded dealing with. Fortunately after reviewing Sheriff Cooper’s report that there was insufficient evidence to support those charges was a relief. Yet it was what Julie said after she was mirandized; uttering a death threat towards Eric’s parents as she is handcuffed and led away. Jack Johnson run on a tough on crime approach; which is why he felt obligated to have her charged as an adult.<br />
<br />
Finishing up his brief for Wednesday when he will argue to have Julie tried as an adult; he looks out the window to see the sky dark. ‘Night time’ he thinks to himself.<br />
“So much for movie night,” he sighs.<br />
Jack Johnson was a werecat and clearly gay. Hoping to have an evening with his boyfriend, it was clear that wasn’t going to happen; Jack wondered if he would ever have any time with his paramour, what with his job and all. Knowing that once he gets home there will be the usual argument of not keeping a promise; he sighs as he makes a mental note to pick up roses and de-alcoholised beer. Hoping that will help stem the fight he will soon face. Jack is about to leave when someone knocks on his office door.<br />
<br />
“Enter,” Jack answers not knowing who is about to crap on his day.<br />
“Jack;” a strong-willed woman greeting him.<br />
Jack turns around to see Brett Smithson standing before him. Knowing this can’t be good; he offers her a seat and sits back down. “Brett, for what do I owe the pleasure,” trying to be polite.<br />
“Julie Stovall,” Brett looking serious; “I’m representing her.”<br />
<br />
Jack blanches; he knows he is in for a tough fight if Brett will be defending Julie. The were-badger sitting in front of him was known to be as ruthless in court as he. He is about to say something when she cuts him off.<br />
“Let’s get straight to the point,” she opens her briefcase to hand him several motions; “motion for discovery; I must review the evidence against my client. Motion to have Julie tried in juvenile court; you of all people know I won’t let you steam roll my client over what she foolishly said in front of the sheriff and witnesses. And lastly,” pulling another motion out of her briefcase; “motion to have Julie examined to determine if she is competent to stand trial.”<br />
<br />
Jack looks at the last motion handed to him and couldn’t help but snort; “teenage hormone defense? You have to be joking.”<br />
“Mental competency,” Brett not taking the bait as she gets up; “I’ll see you in court Wednesday. I look forward to hearing your arguments. Until then I want a copy of all the evidence and police reports. Including witness statements and surveillance footage.”<br />
Jack watches Brett walk out of his office; looking at the motions she handed him, he sighs; “non-alcoholic beer isn’t going to cut it this time.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Jack arrives home with no lights lit up; his paramour left he thinks. Just as he enters his home, he hears a howl from the forest not far from his house. Not knowing that the howl came from Nate Anderson as he climaxed with Jean Talbot; Jack heads inside, the lights immediately come on.<br />
“Sorry for being late,” Looking at his lover; “Bad day at the office.”<br />
“You made a promise,” Jack’s lover looking upset.<br />
“I know,” Jack sighs as he places the roses and bottle of chardonnay on the kitchen counter.<br />
“You think roses and wine will make up for our ruined evening?”<br />
“The roses are for you Mark,” Jack states as he gets a corkscrew; “The wine is for mostly for me.”<br />
The anger and disappointment in Mark fades as he sees his lover clearly distressed; “must be bad then to forgo near-beer and get a bottle of white.”<br />
“Brett Smithson,” Jack answers; “she came by my office as I was about to leave and buries me with motions. She is representing Julie Stovall.”<br />
“Brett Smithson the were-badger,” Mark looking worried; ”that Brett Smithson?”<br />
“She is the only lawyer were-badger into,” Jack taking a big drink of his wine; “Unless of course you know another one.”<br />
“Well your home,” Mark states; “and I could never stay mad at you for long. Come sit down, we’ll watch the evening news together then turn in.”<br />
Jack smiles as he pours two glasses and hands one to Mark; “that would be nice.”<br />
<br />
Jack Johnson and his partner Mark head to the sofa to watch the last of the nightly news. Mark also a werecat like Jack; both belonging to the same were-cat pride, but only officially meeting one night at the Were Club as Mark was tending the bar. Tonight was his night off from work and was hoping to have an evening with Jack. While Jack’s job was at times very consuming; he did at least try to make time for their relationship.<br />
“The night may be a wash,” Jack sipping his wine; “But there is always tomorrow.”<br />
“There is always the bed upstairs,” Mark gulping his glass of wine grinning at his lover.<br />
Jack grins, “After the news Mark;” placing an arm around his partner jack thinks ‘perhaps the night isn’t so much at a loss after all.’<br />
