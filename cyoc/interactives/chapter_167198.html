<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Kevin drove to the vet, Luke hesitantly played with his chew toy, as he tried to fight the changes in his mind. “I must keep it together, I can´t let Kev… master change me more. Maybe repeating helps. I´m Luke, Kev… master´s older brother and a human. That´s not right. I´m Luke, master´s older bro… pet and a human. No, keep focusing. I´m Luke, master´s ol… loyal bro… pet and a human. I´m Luke, master´s ol… loyal pet and a hum… dog. I´m Luk… Lucky, master´s loyal pet and a hum… dog. I´m Luk… Lucky, master´s loyal pet and a dog. I´m Lucky, master´s loyal pet and a dog.” The longer he repeated that sentence, the more it cemented into his head, until he didn´t really notice the changes anymore.<br />
<br />
When Kevin finally parked at the vets, Lucky still repeated his sentence like a mantra, only nothing was right anymore. “I´m Lucky, masters loyal dog pet.”<br />
<br />
“Come on boy, let´s get you ready.” Kevin said, and Lucky obediently jumped down from the trunk and followed his master inside. While in the waiting room Kevin petted him. “Don´t worry, bro – ups, boy, soon you will get your shots and we can head home again. Then we can play a bit, maybe some fetch, Luke – ähm Lucky.” “Damn…” Kevin thought, “I need to get over these mistakes. The more I make them, the longer Lucky will remember his old life.”<br />
<br />
Lucky looked confused at his master. “Bro? Luke? Who does he mean?” To calm his master, Lucky licked his hand a few times.<br />
<br />
What Luke hadn´t known when he had started to repeat his thoughts earlier, was that the constant repeating did the opposite of what he intended. Normally mistakes like Kevin´s would disturb the mental adjustments, but the repeating had replaced most of the meaning to the new mindset, and now mistakes wouldn´t set him back so easily. It would need more repeats from Kevin´s mistakes in a short time for Lucky to remember being Luke now.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later Kevin and Lucky left the vet with Lucky´s license and after all his shots. “Now let´s go home, boy. Up you go.” Kevin said as he opened the back of the truck. Lucky jumped up obediently, and Kevin closed the lid, tied the leach to the truck and got in himself. Soon he was driving them home.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Kevin played fetch with Lucky for two hours after a quick snack, Lucky would get food afterwards. Lucky happily run around, jumped to try getting the thrown ball mid-air, and had overall fun.<br />
<br />
But the fun raised Lucky´s excitement, which resulted in him getting horny as well, but Kevin didn´t notice. At least not until Lucky got over the edge just as he brought the ball back, and some of his black cum hit Kevin´s right leg just above right sock. “Yuck, bad boy. I don´t want your jizz on me, Luke, ähm Lucky.” Kevin ranted loudly.<br />
<br />
While the name Luke didn´t do anything to Lucky, his jizz did something to Kevin. Before Kevin had any chance to wipe it off it expanded on his leg and down into his sock. “What the ….” He exclaimed, and then he remembered a warning they had gotten from uncle John.<br />
<br />
“After Luke is finished changing, you need to go to the vet to register him as your pet. Remember to fix him then, as his cum will be able to change others who get it on naked skin as well.” That was what he explained. But Kevin had ignored the warning and forgotten to get Lucky fixed.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck” Kevin said as the latex cum slowly crept up his leg as well. His foot already felt uncomfortable in his sock and shoe, but Kevin suppressed the instinct to remove them. Instead he made a run for the house.<br />
<br />
Halfway there he toppled over as he stumbled. Looking back, he saw the latex already was on both legs, most likely they had touched each other as he run. The problem, however, was that while it covered him it also changed him underneath, and his legs had just changed into hind-legs. That made him unbalanced on just two legs.<br />
<br />
Kevin lost a minute trying to get up again, but it was no use. Just as he decided to try running on his hands and changed legs, he felt a push behind him. Lucky was by now there, and sniffed his ass like he was a dog already. “No, bad dog, go away.” But by now Lucky didn´t recognize Kevin as his master anymore, but as his playmate, so he didn´t follow the order. Instead he tackled Kevin from behind, effectively pinning Kevin down. And while Lucky was a rubber dog now, he was still mostly his old size and weight. Kevin was unable to push him off.<br />
<br />
Kevin´s tail burst out just underneath his belt, ripping a hole into his shorts. At the same time his back bend around. Even if he could get up on two legs again, his back would be rather uncomfortable. A soft whine escaped Kevin. “No, need to get up and to the phone quickly. Lucky down.”<br />
<br />
While he tried to order Lucky, another feeling started to grow, as his jeans tented. That soon flattened a bit again, as his cock was also covered in latex and a sheath formed around it. But it remained super sensitive, and the friction of his jeans drove him crazy.<br />
<br />
Instead of jumping down from Kevin´s back as ordered, Lucky laid down on it, locking him even more on the ground. The latex traveled up Kevin´s body and down his arms in nearly no time, and before Kevin could think much about it, his hands had become paws. “No, I need my fore-paws to use the phone. Wait, I meant my hands, not my fore-paws. I need my fore-paws. Fuck, its already messing with my head.”<br />
<br />
It wasn´t long after Kevin cursed that the latex started to cover his head, and he closed his mouth firmly, hoping it didn´t get inside of him. It turned his ears pointy and stretched his mouth and nose into a muzzle. When it covered his eyes finally, his vision returned after a couple of seconds, but in only shades of black and white. His body was done changing now, and he looked like a slightly smaller twin of Lucky. His firmly closed mouth turned muzzle was pried open by the latex, and before he could do anything it crept down his throat, taking his voice just like it had done with Luke´s before. But he wasn´t barking for long, as similar to Luke before he was muzzled tightly.<br />
<br />
The muzzle reacted to orders from the master, so it didn´t need to be removed ever. Lucky had been able to play fetch because Kevin had allowed it to open, but that permission ended after an hour, and just then Lucky´s muzzle closed again, silencing them both. And while Lucky didn´t thought about it as bad, Kevin panicked even more. “I need help, fast. But I can´t get my mate away. Wait, mate? I meant Lucky. I need to get mate away.”<br />
<br />
But Lucky just felt asleep on top of Kevin, bored as he wasn´t playing with him, effectively trapping Kevin underneath. It was over an hour later that their dad Mike found them laying in the garden. “What happened here? Luke? Kevin, what have you done now?” He approached them, looking them over, noticing the name tag on Lucky´s collar. “You renamed him Lucky, Kevin? I thought you would let him keep his name. Maybe I should do you the same favor and rename you as well when I fix you both. You know what, Kevin, from now on I will call you Naïve, it´s fitting you after all. Right, Naïve?”<br />
<br />
Kevin again tried to free himself, but his father´s words sunk in far too fast. “No, dad stop. Help me get this off. Da… master. Fuck, I need to fight it off, I´m Kevin, not Naïve.”<br />
<br />
Lucky had already accepted his former dad as his new master now. And was quick to follow him as he went back inside. When master called “Come” he had been good and already been on his heels. His mate had remained behind, but after the call he came running, stumbling a couple of times because of his clothes.<br />
<br />
After a quick call, a second appointment was made with the vet. Mike took some time to get Kevin´s clothes off of Naïve. They were mostly intact, beside the tail-hole in the shorts only the socks had ripped in a bit from his new claws. Mike throw the socks and the shorts away, but Kevin´s shoes, belt, underwear and shirt were put to the side.<br />
<br />
Kevin was begging his father to stop stripping him, but his rubber body didn´t resist as his master took off first his shoes and ripped socks. He loosened the belt, but as the shorts were stuck with Naïve´s tail he ripped them off, and then pulled down Kevin´s underwear. Getting the shirt off was far easier than Kevin expected it to be for his father.<br />
<br />
Soon after both Lucky and Naïve were on the truck and tied. During the drive, Kevin made the same false conclusion as Luke had before, that repeating his name and such would help him remember it, but like his brother before, it did the opposite. He even used Luke´s human name at the beginning, even when he had tried to only call him Lucky.<br />
<br />
“I need to remember myself. I´m Kevin, Luke´s younger brother and da… master´s loved son and a human. I´m Kevin, Luk… Lucky´s younger brother and da… master´s loved son and a human. I´m Kevin, Luk… Lucky´s younger bro… mate and master´s loved so… pet and a human. No, that´s not right, focus. I´m Kevin, Lucky´s you… playful bro… mate and master´s lov… loyal so…. pet and a human. Fuck. I´m Kev… Naïve, Lucky´s you… playful mate and master´s lov… loyal pet and a hum… dog. I´m Kev… Naïve, Lucky´s playful mate and master´s loyal pet and a hum… dog. I´m Naïve, Lucky´s playful mate and master´s loyal pet and a dog.”<br />
<br />
Like with Luke, by the time they reached the vet, Kevin was mostly gone. The shots were done quickly, and fixing them by removing the balls from both dogs took around an hour. It was tricky to remove the balls of a rubber dog, but on the bright side, they didn´t need to stay afterwards, as there wasn´t any danger of them getting infected, so Mike took them home shortly later. The vet would come by in a few days to check on them.<br />
<br />
Both Lucky and Naïve only woke up late, long after being home again. And, even if they didn´t know, because they didn´t remember being human anymore, locked forever as dogs. Something about the latex made the changes permanent after getting fixed. Without removing their balls, not only was their jizz able to change others who had contact to it, but they would have changed back after maybe a month. Something John hadn´t explained to them. Mike had only wanted to teach Luke a lesson and give Kevin a pet for some time, but now they would remain so for the rest of their lifes.</p>
