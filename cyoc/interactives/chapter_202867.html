<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;WOAH!&quot; Josh&#39;s southern voice woke me and Ethan up. The two of us jolted up from the bed. I was only in underwear and the t shirt I was wearing the previous day, while Ethan was completely nude. His body still pressed tightly against mine but the moment he recognized Josh in there he made sure there was distance between us. Not to mention how he instantly covered up his massive dick. &quot;Hey now, no need for shame,&quot; Josh added as he dropped his own shorts and underwear. The stripped off his own shirt in complete and total comfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need for solidarity,&quot; Ethan growled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thought didn&#39;t even cross my mind. Nude is the best way to go. Don&#39;t go gettin any ideas like I&#39;d be trying to steal yer boyfriend, as cute as he may be,&quot; Josh added a tip of his cowboy hat and a wink. I felt my face flush red. Followed by a continuous low rumbling growl from Ethan.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not my boyfriend,&quot; Ethan said.<br />
<br />
Josh just let out a laugh. &quot;That there love mark on his neck begs ta differ.&quot; I instinctually grabbed for my neck. It was tender. Josh snorted another laugh as he continued to saunter around the room in the nude as though he didn&#39;t have a care in the world. His dense muscular body always made him imposing, but with this amount of confidence without anything on made him look like an absolute unit. &quot;No shame man. Love is love or whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
With his country accent and overall confidence, it almost sounded snarky. Josh didn&#39;t mean anything by it. But Ethan only seemed to be more worked up. I wasn&#39;t sure if he was gay or not. It was a common insult thrown at us in high school, but I wasn&#39;t sure whether or not to believe it. Not that I would have been mad. Hell, it would have been nice to have him as my boyfriend. And even more so now. I jumped between the two. &quot;It&#39;s just we&#39;re not dating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not dating,&quot; I said firmly before Josh would say something else. Even if he wasn&#39;t trying to be mean, it came off that way. I could tell he was just trying to lighten the mood. It was just in his own way. However, I had to squash it. &quot;We&#39;re just friends.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure man,&quot; Josh nodded. Then instantly changed the subject. &quot;You work out?&quot;<br />
<br />
The quick change in the conversation seemed to throw Ethan for a loop. &quot;What?&quot; Though it sounded a bit more like a statement than a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;You work out?&quot; Josh repeated. This time added some fake bicep curls for emphasis. His biceps bulged into perfectly sized baseballs. &quot;You know work out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh... No?&quot; Ethan said. His eyes narrowed. The anger was dropping out of him as he was realizing that Josh was just that kind of guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;BRO! No fuckin way man! Like seriously... Don&#39;t fuckin lie bro! There&#39;s no way a guy built like you don&#39;t work out!&quot; Josh was nearly jumping around as he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... But I don&#39;t...&quot; Ethan said. He was suddenly more self-conscious about his nude body, covering it up as much as he could. Though, it would be nearly impossible to really cover up much of anything at all as there was way too much space.<br />
<br />
&quot;BRO!&quot; Josh shouted again. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it. Bro, you gotta come work out with me and Corey. If you really don&#39;t work out, just wait till I get you in the gym. Bro, you&#39;ll be even more of a fucking hulk. Like seriously, how can&#39;t you work out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just never did,&quot; Ethan said. He was looking at me for some kind of support, but I didn&#39;t have any to give.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s some crazy shit. You gotta work out with us. We&#39;ll make you fuckin huge. Well. Huge-er. Then maybe introduce you to coach. Coach Hoggat can always use a guy like you,&quot; Josh continued. &quot;C&#39;mon man. We&#39;re about to work out. How bout you join us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I--&quot; Ethan paused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bro. Don&#39;t give me a fuckin excuse. Like I don&#39;t give a shit if you&#39;re fuckin my roommate. Seriously,&quot; he paused. &quot;Bro! Just think how much more he&#39;d like you if you did! C&#39;mon man. Or at least talk to Coach about joining a team,&quot; he paused again. &quot;Then tell him I sentchya. I need to get on his good side again.&quot; His phone vibrated. &quot;Bro. It&#39;s Corey. He&#39;s waiting for me. Look,&quot; he said pulling up his &#39;lucky jockstrap&#39;, &quot;I&#39;ll be in the gym. You go there and I&#39;ll welcome you with open arms. Maybe I can get Corey on his knees if you really want it.&quot; Adding another wink at his &#39;joke.&#39; Then rushed to the door, wearing nothing but the jock. &quot;Just think about it. Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Ethan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuckin&#39; A bro! Fuckin A!&quot; Josh said and rushed out without a care in the world. <br />
<br />
A few moments of silence passed before Ethan spoke. &quot;You think I should go?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to. Josh isn&#39;t that bad of a guy. I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be happy to train you,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... But I&#39;ve never been in a gym,&quot; Ethan said sheepishly. His voice almost squeaked as his face burned a bit red. It was kind of cute at the stark difference between his massive, steely face and the feeling of embarrassment. <br />
<br />
I thought back to the notebook. One sentence and all of that would change. But I didn&#39;t know what else would change with that sentence. We still stayed friends over the summer as he gained 100 pounds of pure muscle. I just didn&#39;t know how much else would change either. I&#39;d need to test a few more things before really doing anything too drastic to my friends. &quot;Maybe you should try,&quot; I offered. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you go with me?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go-go with you?&quot; I stammered.<br />
<br />
Ethan&#39;s heavy shoulders shrugged. &quot;Sure. Why not?&quot; He leaned back into me.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about the coach? Or what about your shorts?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
He looked at me. A bit of shock on his face. &quot;Oh shit! Where are my shorts?!&quot; His nudity was suddenly apparent again. The comfort he&#39;d gained since Josh left, suddenly left again. His muscles tightened. The dark hairs molded over his body perfectly. <br />
<br />
I took it upon myself to grab one of Josh&#39;s shorts and shirt. I tossed them into his body and he looked confused. &quot;They should be able to fit. Maybe a little small but nothing too bad.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;m sure,&quot; I said. &quot;Go on. Put them on.&quot; He did as he was told. The sleeveless shirt molded around his thick pecs. At least one of his nipples kept slipping out. But with the lack of sleeves, his wide shoulders weren&#39;t confined by anything. Not to mention those strong arms. He turned around to try to hide his massive dick, but that didn&#39;t mean that I didn&#39;t get a great view of that perfectly shaped ass. Even as he pulled the shorts up, they shaped perfectly to his rear. The clothes still left very little to the imagination. Only the thick black forest of hair running down his chest and abs were covered up. <br />
<br />
&quot;What about shoes?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Shit...&quot; Josh&#39;s had grown a couple of sizes, but I could tell just by looking at Ethan&#39;s feet that the size 13&#39;s would be a bit too small. &quot;One second. Let me think of something.&quot; I took the notebook into the bathroom. &#39;I have a pair of tennis shoes big enough for Ethan Montgomery&#39;s feet in this bathroom. Along with a pair of socks.&#39; As the ink dried, the pair sneakers appeared next to the toilet. I quickly looked at the size. 15. &quot;Jesus...&quot; I muttered, thinking just how big those shoes had to be. I knew Ethan was big, but to have such massive feet seemed ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I picked them up, flushed the toilet, turned the water on and then off again. &quot;Found some,&quot; I held them up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You found them? In the bathroom?&quot; Ethan asked. He tilted his head just like his wolf form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye-yeah,&quot; I panicked. &quot;One of Josh&#39;s friends left them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to wear a stranger&#39;s shoes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop being weird about it. Just go workout with Josh. It&#39;ll be good for you,&quot; I ordered.<br />
<br />
Still something in his eyes seemed to have been thinking hard. &quot;Hey... You know how you asked me about...&quot; His eyes darted to the notebook, staring intently. Then looked away. &quot;Never mind.&quot; Ethan put the socks and shoes on. &quot;Let&#39;s go?&quot;<br />
<br />
I instinctively reached for my phone to check it. &quot;WAIT! Shit! My shorts!&quot; My eyes darted around the room only to not find anything. They were obviously not in the room, but I still looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You lost you&#39;re shorts?&quot; Ethan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ripped them off me, picked me up and then jumped into a pond,&quot; I glared. He turned a bit red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I?&quot; he scratched his cheek looking off in a different direction. The tightness of his shorts made it fairly obvious that he wasn&#39;t opposed to the idea, even now. He didn&#39;t seem to remember the night too much. I kind of wondered how much his human and wolf brain shared. It seemed to be quite a bit in personality, but not so much in memories.<br />
<br />
I rolled my eyes. Then decided what I&#39;d do.</p>
