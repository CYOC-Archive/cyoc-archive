<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex noticed that the one being fucked was being rammed in his vagina &#39;His? No it has to be a guy... a g-guy...&#39; its strange, no matter how hard he tried Alex couldn&#39;t think of women, he remembered the words he knew what he was talking about, but hard as he tried he couldn&#39;t think of that wolf with a cunt as a man, it was as though so force was rejecting the notion of females from his mind, at least in terms of these wolves. His mind preoccupied by this thought leaving him defenseless as another figure came from behind and capture the naked boy, &quot;Hey wha...&quot; &quot;Enjoying the show?&quot; the figure asked (rhetorically) aggressively tying Alex up before slinging him over the shoulder.<br />
<br />
The two wolves climaxed, one filling the others womb with cum, though they didn&#39;t get to enjoy the after glow for long as &quot;HEEEEYY!!!&quot; the figure carrying Alex yelled at the two &quot;The fuck you two doing!? You two want to get captured like the rest?&quot; the two wolves hung their heads in shame, before attempting to speak (at least that&#39;s what it looked like to Alex) &quot;Come on, I caught this little bitch for an interrogation.&quot; after saying that Alex was surprised to see the two wolve bodies start to shift and change, first standing on two legs, before their paws transformed into hands, their fur began to recede along side their muzzle, their faces shifting to something more human. At the end of their transformation they were almost entirely human, still maintaining the ears and tails of wolves and in the case of the male with a cock it remained canine as well.<br />
<br />
In seeing this more human form Alex could also see that both were indeed male, even if one had female genitals. The two nervously and ashamedly tried to speak again but nothing came out as the figure (who Alex now realized had the same form as the other two, albeit taller and more muscular) simply walked in one direction, the other two following. Soon enough the four men came upon a cave and entering found it to contain an entire village of similarly wolf like people. Most of the people of this village were exactly like the figure and his two companions, mostly human with ears and tails of wolves, though a few were fully anthropomorphic.  Some had canine cocks while others hade cunts, some even had both as Alex learned while seeing a pair fucking right out in the open public, clearly both had cocks and clearly not doing anal.<br />
<br />
Taking Alex into the deepest part of the cave where the largest hut of the village lay, the four entered to find another man, clearly older than the rest, masturbating, hand sliding across cock. The man carrying Alex sighed in annoyance though this was undercut by the triumphant moans of the older (and still handsome) man as he came, white strikes of cum flying in the air. A few moments latter the old man stated &quot;So who&#39;s the guest.&quot; surprising nonchalant as he continued to cum for several minutes straight &quot;One of those slavers trying to catch these two dunderheads.&quot; The man carrying Alex stated as he threw him to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I don&#39;t know anything about slaving, or you-you werewolves or whatever you are, or even where the hell I am.&quot; Alex responded &quot;Well why the hell didn&#39;t you tell me that on the way here instead of making me lug ya like bail of wheat.&quot; the man angerly replied. Taking a moment to process what was just yelled at him Alex asked &quot;You-you actually believe me? Normally in situations like this people don&#39;t just believe the first things another says to them.&quot; pausing a moment &quot;Are you dumb.&quot; Alex unintentionally thought out loud. As Alex received an angry glare the older man piped up stating that &quot;Lokota received the Blessing of Truth at birth. As such he can detect when another is lying, its so strong that even magic can not hide the truth from him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Magic? Blessings?&#39; Alex thought &#39;Well honestly that explains a lot about this situation.&#39; &quot;Now that we know he is no treat why don&#39;t you untie or guest.&quot; the older man asked of Lokota &quot;Yeah, yeah, sure...&quot; Lokota answered as he did just that. As Alex was being untied one of the wolves from earlier finally regained his voice and asked &quot;Why were you in the woods then? Most humans don&#39;t go out this far at night and even the ones that do tend to go out in a pack and make camps.&quot; finishing at the same time Lokota finally untied Alex &quot;You have a good point Tlok.&quot; before Lokota could re-tie Alex as the look in his face indicated he intended to do Alex quickly brought his hands in front of himself making stop gestures as he proclaimed &quot;Wait, wait, I can explain myself, j-just wait a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking the time to explain his situation to the four werewolves they were somewhat surprised, though not as much as Alex expected. The others looked at Lokota for confirmation &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s telling the truth. He&#39;s definitely from another world.&quot; he stated. Stunned by their casualness Alex asked &quot;Is that common around here?&quot; &quot;I wouldn&#39;t say its common, but it happen often enough to know your story isn&#39;t crazy.&quot; the old man replied &quot;Honestly I&#39;m more surprised how casual your about this.&quot; added Tlok &quot;In my defense I had a lot of time to process this. Plus it happen a lot in stories back, some people even complain about how common Isekai is but it is what it is.&quot; Alex responded, the others a bit confused by the term Isekai but otherwise following his words.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what now?&quot; the wolf who&#39;s name Alex didn&#39;t know (something to fix latter) asked &quot;Well first Lokota needs to apologize for his actions.&quot; the older man stated &quot;Yeah, yeah...&quot; Lokota responded &quot;Hey I&#39;m sorry, I was just a bit on edge cause of...&quot; Lokota genuinely apologize, trailing off at the end as he hit what was obviously a sore subject &quot;I remember you mentioning something about slavers earlier. Big problem?&quot; &quot;Yeah at least twelve people have gone missing.&quot; Tlok began &quot;We&#39;re friends with a nearby human, will mostly human, village and they made a request at the adventures guild but the local noble forced the guild to reject the request, basically confirming that its slavers and that he is involved to some degree.&quot; Mr. Nameless as Alex decided to call him until finding out his name stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;It ain&#39;t your problem so you can just move on.&quot; Lokota stated &quot;Your right it not my problem, but I want to help if I can.&quot; Alex responded &quot;You&#39;d really help us?&quot; Tlok replied excitably asked &quot;I&#39;m not the type of person who lays down his life for strangers, but if I can help I want to. I&#39;d feel guilty if I didn&#39;t do whatever I could.&quot; Alex answered &quot;Thanks otherworlder but we&#39;d feel guilty for getting you caught or worse trying that so...&quot; Lokota replied before the old man interrupted &quot;Now, now Lokota if he can help we shouldn&#39;t miss this opportunity, and even if he can&#39;t we should host him until he gets his bearings.&quot; Lokota wanted to reply but the old man just gave a look that said &#39;The conversation is over&#39; and the younger wolf man stayed quiet. &quot;That&#39;s, that, now just wait a moment while I find a place for you to stay while your here.&quot; the older man stated as he left the hut. Now all that was left for Alex to consider is, what next.</p>
