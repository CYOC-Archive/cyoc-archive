<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Waking up Tuesday morning Ethan dressed for school and made sure Eric was up and getting ready too. His little brother walked into the kitchen, and Ethan choked back a laugh. Eric&#39;s preference in clothing had changed towards closer fitting pants, and today his morning wood was pushing out obscenely far.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez, your cock looks like it&#39;s trying to make a run for it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric beamed, pratically glowing with enjoyment at Ethan&#39;s use of the word &#39;your&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know! It gets like this all the time in the mornings,&quot; he complained. Sitting down, he poured some cereal and the two brothers exchanged grins. It was unspoken, but they felt closer as brothers after the previous day. Ethan had never felt more grateful that Eric was his little brother, and Eric&#39;s idolisation of Ethan had just grown after being given so much trust and respect. It was easier to be open with each other, and although not EVERYTHING was revealed, there was more honesty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ethan,&quot; Eric asked as they ate. &quot;What do you like about being small? I mean, being bigger is just interesting. I know I&#39;m supposed to be too young to know about sex stuff. Like, they teach it when we&#39;re older and all of that, but I&#39;m not stupid.&quot; He rolled his eyes at the idea. &quot;I learned a bunch about how fun it is, &#39;cause my dick is 17 and it knows how to do those things.&quot; He paused, and giggled. &quot;Sorry, I just love saying it&#39;s mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t apologise. It IS yours!&quot; Ethan laughed, feeling surprisingly relaxed about the whole affair. Eric&#39;s good nature and mature attitude for his age was helping with that, though. &quot;You&#39;re lucky, you get to have fun a lot earlier than other kids would! And, it&#39;s hard to say about what I like. I guess it&#39;s exciting, but it&#39;s scary too, because I don&#39;t want to be caught.&quot; He nodded, now feeling comfortable admitting things to Eric that he couldn&#39;t tell anybody else. &quot;I guess it sounds funny, but it&#39;s kinda thrilling because I feel different to everyone, and I know others would think I look freaky if they see how small I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t. I think it&#39;s really cool that you like it.&quot; Eric nodded solemnly. &quot;That&#39;s not nice though, and they&#39;re jerks if they treat you that way.<br />
<br />
Ethan ruffled his brother&#39;s hair affectionately, and finished off his glass of OJ. &quot;You&#39;re a bigger man than they are, then!&quot; He chuckled. &quot;Literally!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric giggled, and they got up to put their dishes in the sink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, just so you know,&quot; he spoke as they got ready to leave, &quot;I might swap us a couple of times before school ends. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll keep the ring very safe, but I just wanted you to know that I won&#39;t maroon you with your small cock the whole day ... but ... it might be kinda random!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noted. Thanks for the heads up, little bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan took a deep breath as they got in the car, ready for school.<br />
<br />
Random swaps? The day was probably going to be interesting, then.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
The first change came in the middle of the morning, during his maths class. Ethan was asked to come up to the whiteboard to show his working for one of the algebra problems, and right as he took the marker off the sub teacher, an attractive younger woman, he felt it happen. The material of his pants filled out as his penis pushed forward, his balls swelling dramatically. Flushing, he turned quickly toward the board, his chemical-infused brain glancing at the teacher&#39;s low-cut top, before he tried to focus on writing out the equation.<br />
<br />
Returning to his seat afterwards, his crotch was plumped up, a bit turned on from the rush of swapping. He even saw a couple of girls casually check him out as he went past them to sit back down. Biting back a smile, his face light pink, he turned to the front and tried not to snicker at the excitement.<br />
<br />
Then again, at lunch! Ethan was sitting down with a couple of friends in the cafeteria, when he felt the pulling sensation of it shrinking away again. The fact that hotdogs were one of the lunch menu items and that everyone at his table had gotten one, added a new layer of awkward, and his heart began to pound with nervous excitement that even the food seemed to be mocking him. He had a momentary fantasy where all the hot dogs would change size to match their owner&#39;s cock, and his friends would start laughing when they saw Ethan&#39;s dog dwindle down to a bite-size snack, just a couple of inches long.<br />
<br />
Tucking into his food, Ethan kept quiet, his little cock almost painfully stiff in his pants, just listening to his friends chatter as he secretly enjoyed the thrill of his brother&#39;s swaps.<br />
<br />
The third one happened during the mid afternoon, in his chemistry class. His crotch filling out AGAIN just compounded the earlier excitement, and it was difficult to keep the swagger out of his step. It was like a secret game, and he was loving how it made his hormones spike and his mood flutter, like he&#39;d taken a hit of dopamine, or how his body felt after he just scored a really good swimming time, his muscles and adrenaline pumped.<br />
<br />
During the final period, a study bloc, Ethan was passing by one of the school nurse offices through the quiet corridors on the way to the library, his mood buoyant, when someone grabbed his arm, and pulled him inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry that I keep jumping you,&quot; Haylee whispered, &quot;but I&#39;ve been thinking about you a LOT.&quot;<br />
<br />
She flicked the door sign to &#39;occupied&#39; and grabbed his hand, pulling him through to the sick bay beds, which were empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;The nurse is having a coffee with the dean, so she&#39;ll be gone a little while. My aunt works in the admin office, so I maybe sorta took advantage of knowing their schedules.&quot; She bit her lip, a mischevious look showing, then she turned serious. &quot;Look, if I&#39;m being too extra, it&#39;s fine, but tell me I&#39;m not imagining that you&#39;re interested too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am! I think you&#39;re really pretty! I&#39;m just- ... &quot; Ethan took a deep breath, &quot;I have this rep I wasn&#39;t even aware of until recently, just &#39;cause of my dick ... but I don&#39;t really have much experience. Not like a virgin or anything, but-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then allow me.&quot; She hushed him, and pulled him into a kiss.<br />
<br />
In moments she was stripping off their clothes in between further kisses, and she guided him onto a bed. He lay back, and climbing between his legs, Haylee was eyeing him hungrily once she realised that Ethan was at his full size. She ran her hands over his upper body in admiration of his physique, and his selfconsiousness vanished as she lowered down to her target. Sliding him into her mouth, Haylee began to greedily suck his cock.<br />
<br />
Her lips felt soft and slick, and her technique was great! Ethan was in heaven as he watched her blow him, loving every swish and flick of her tongue on his long thick shaft. A couple of times she nearly choked, but she was clearly experienced and recovered easily. After a couple of minutes Haylee pulled off, and delicately wiped her mouth. He could see the glisten on her thighs and her eyes were locked on his erection with determination, damp from her saliva, as she climbed up to straddle him. It was a super horny moment watching her lower herself and slowly mount him.<br />
<br />
The feeling for Ethan was unreal. <br />
<br />
Haylee slid down his dick, feeding it inside herself, and Ethan stared openmouthed. The impossibly tight wet warmth gripped him, and she leaned forward, her hips moving as they began to kiss again. The rhythm of her movement was steady, and he was tortured by the absolutely amazing massage of it, his cock bigger and harder than it had ever been. The feeling of her riding him was divine, and the squeezing suctioning action put his limited previous encounters to shame.<br />
<br />
Just as he was starting to approach a plateau where he didn&#39;t think he could bear it much longer, Haylee started to pick up the speed a bit, and Ethan grunted in appreciation, the motion SO fantastic, and then-<br />
<br />
-out of nowhere, like the previous night-<br />
<br />
-Ethan&#39;s cock suddenly shortened and narrowed into a little super-hard rod.<br />
<br />
Haylee broke off their kisses and she gasped, but she only stopped moving for a second. Her expression went from the bliss of fucking a large cock, to a very different kind of expression that was just as horny but in a totally new way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep it up, big boy.&quot; Haylee whispered, her hips moving again, her eyes lusting over his completely shocked look. The surprise almost put him off, but his juvenile dick was buried inside Haylee&#39;s soft wet pussy, and his sensitive length was straining as hard as it could.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, let me feel every inch of your massive hard cock,&quot; she murmured into his ear, the words seeming to fly straight from his brain right to his crotch. Her walls gripped him, and he whimpered in embarrassed pleasure, knowing his reduced adolescent stamina couldn&#39;t deal with so much stimulation.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so long, so fat,&quot; Haylee panted, &quot;so big and manly!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a final push against him, she shuddered and moaned. Her vagina was clamping around him as he came right after her. Buried inside one of the prettiest girls in his year, Ethan&#39;s face went bright red at the sheer perfect euphoria and total humiliation of having his tiny stiff cock twitch and spurt in a desperate boyish imitation of an orgasm.</p>
