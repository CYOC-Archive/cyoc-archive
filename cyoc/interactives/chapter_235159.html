<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff went to the internet to understand how the world has responded its new... &quot;superpower&quot; for lack of a better word. Jeff found some really weird information. <br />
<br />
Pregnancy with people turned cum is possible, therefore a man who ejaculates into a woman, could get her pregnant, and not be the father. People believe this is a form of rebirth, and there are cases for people remembering past lives, however advances in genetic testing show the rebirthed are no more genetically related to the progenitor than offspring. Attempting to rebirth someone in this manner circumvents their natural reconstitution and is considered murder in the same way ejecting someone into a fire, down the toilet, or into alcohol would be.<br />
<br />
History is now filled with stories of great triumphs and cunning maneuvers where tribes escaped slaughter in the balls of the tribesmen who bravely ran away. Small battalions of soldiers waddled their way across hostile lands carrying armor and weapons, becoming an entire army right outside the gates of the enemies. Due to its stasis like effects and the natural ability to remove foreign objects, lives have been saved by cummifying the wounded and carrying them to safety in the heat of battle, removing shrapnel and bullets in the process. The Titanic went down in history as a colossal near disaster, but most made it to safety residing in the testicles of heroic men who endured hours of testicular anguish to ensure the safety of everyone they could protect.<br />
<br />
The concept of men and masculinity had split more drastically between bachelor and family man. The family man shifted from brute force protector to, an endurance protector. The man will house the family, the woman will nurture the family. Abandoning a place and objects to ensure the family goes on, is seen as fulfilling the role of being a man. <br />
<br />
Medically, even modern science is all over the map... Reverting to gamete cells may have a rejuvenating effect on the person becoming cum, toxins seem to be left behind on the clothes, but any that come with are extra damaging, so in many cases its a wash... There are reports of cancers being cured after the process, there are reports of it escalating, there are reports of it being transferred to the male after the original person has been expelled. Attempts at genetic modification have had great success on people turned cum, as well as horrible horrible tragedies. <br />
<br />
New... diseases exist, hyper cummification where in the mere presence of a sexually mature man, the subject begins to cummify involuntarily and without needing consent from the man. The inability to become cum, these people are locked in their physical form. There is the inability to accept a cummified person, and erectile dysfunction can make a man unable to release a person they are holding.<br />
<br />
Drugs exist that can force someone to become cum even without a male presence often leading to death. The fastest reconstitution was 46:12, the fastest cummification was 1:03.<br />
<br />
Cum in culture: Due to its historical prevalence, acknowledgement of cummification and cum holding is widespread through society despite its sexual nature. It is considered part of family friendly tv though nothing is shown anatomically and it is referred to as liquefication instead of the more accurate scientific term of cummification. Despite this, its public depiction has come under fire within certain social movements.<br />
<br />
Long term effects. There is risk of addiction associated with becoming cum, holding cum, or both though scientists have yet to understand why this would be. After an hour of cum holding, the possibility of unification between the holder and the cummified increases substantially based on duration and people held. The immune system is believed to play a major role in preventing changes but more work must be done. Only impacts to the cum holder are identifiable before reconstitution. The cum holder or other cum may have lasting effects on the person after reconstitution going so far as documented cases of complete gender change even in the case of only men entering the study. (An 18 year old man became the genetic father of a 38 year old, now woman who&#39;s Y chromosome was replaced with the young man&#39;s X chromosome completely) Phenotypical changes, personality quirks, even complete memories can be transferred or just copied to another.<br />
<br />
*******************************************<br />
<br />
Jeff was completely engrossed by how drastically everything changed and how foreign this world was, but heard the door open and shut indicating his mom was home... Remembering the promise he made to his father, Jeff was about to greet his mom but realized he had taken his pants and underwear off and greeting his mom naked wasn&#39;t something he wanted to do... Normal clothing did not work for his lower half given his current state... but thankfully he had sweatpants and a bathrobe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey uh Mom, I need to tell you something.&quot; <br />
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; she said not stopping the dinner preparations she began.<br />
Jeff squirmed, this felt more important than a chat over dinner prep but here they were. &quot;It&#39;s actually about dad, he came home early.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I noticed his car, where is he?&quot;<br />
Jeff paused, &quot;He got some really bad news while at work today and wasn&#39;t handling it well.&quot;<br />
She slowed her cutting of the carrot and set down the knife as the situation of her son, talking about the mental state of her husband fell on her. She reset her stance and looked at Jeff noticing he was wearing sweat pants, a t-shirt and a bathrobe. &quot;Alright, talk to me kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff squirmed even more took a deep breath, &quot;He found out Uncle John died this morning, from an overdose.&quot;<br />
She staggered at the news and her face showed the complex mix of feelings befitting the situation. &quot;Oh,&quot; the syllable extended to portray a melody of emotion. &quot;I should talk to him, is he in our room?&quot; she asked solemnly.<br />
Jeff grimaced, still not entirely sure how people feel about his current situation and not even knowing if its considered illegal... &quot;No, Like I mentioned, he wasn&#39;t handling it very well, and he wanted to not exist for a while.&quot;<br />
Her face twisted in confusion, &quot;Is he in a drunken stupor, is he high? Where is he?&quot;<br />
&quot;He&#39;s in me, reduced to a trillion tiny pieces where he doesn&#39;t need to think, or act, or decide anything.&quot; Jeff felt a weird sense of protectiveness over the package in his care. &quot;He-he-he asked... and I was afraid of what he might do as a plan B.&quot; Jeff&#39;s own discomfort with the initial idea shining through but not negating the responsibility he accepted.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw the pieces fall together on her face, &quot;Bring him back.&quot; There was a lack of anything but force behind the statement.<br />
&quot;I told him I&#39;d give him till evening.&quot; Jeff said meekly in the face of the command but a glance at the clock only showed 5:45.<br />
Jeff watched as the statement caused his mom&#39;s filters to engage. In the second it took for her to compose herself and reply, Jeff had already imagined being force fed aphrodisiacs, and stimulated into submission like he was harboring a fugitive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff honey,&quot; Mom began. &quot;Your father got some time away from the situation but any more time in you is just putting off dealing with it which he needs to do. He will have an hour or so as he reconstitutes, he has his family to support him, but staying sperm won&#39;t let any of that happen.&quot; This is where she seemed unsure how to continue. &quot;I know you think you&#39;re protecting him but its actually holding him back from healing, which is painful, will take time, and is hard but necessary. He&#39;s hiding. Please Jeff, go let him out. You gave him some time away from it and he will have an hour to deal in private as he becomes a man again. Go let him out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t refute her words, he went to the bathroom and within a minute was ejaculating into the bathtub. He left the light on and shut the door, returning to his mom to set the timer, and a moment later remembering to move the clothes from the bedroom to the bathroom. He felt much better with his smaller, though still engorged genitals. They seemed larger than when he was holding Dean initially but he was still partially erect so he ignored it.<br />
<br />
Jeff stayed in the sweatpants but ditched the bathrobe still unsure of how to deal with Dean. One problem at a time, right? He began working on his homework which came easier than he expected. After 15 minutes he was called to dinner and neither of them talked with dad&#39;s seat empty. Half an hour later, dinner was done and a plate was made for when dad was fully human again. Jeff pondered how nothing was documented regarding the physics tied to the loss or gain of mass as someone turned into or returned from being an ounce or so of ejaculate...<br />
<br />
Mike was heard moving around in the bathroom, though didn&#39;t respond to his mother&#39;s doting which only made her (and Jeff who never saw him this way) more concerned. She confessed that Jeff spilled the beans and that she knew about John. She came back and said she&#39;d like to see him, as if that wasn&#39;t obvious. She came back later and said she put his dinner in the fridge. It was when the concern had audibly turned to worry and she was begging Mike to just go to bed rather than spending all night in the bathroom, she was on the verge of tears when a response finally came. <br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t hear what was said but his mother&#39;s scream made him jump up in alarm and run, squishing his abused testicles along the way. &quot;Mom, is dad okay? Dad? What&#39;s going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry son, but your dad ain&#39;t here.&quot; came the voice of a strange man.<br />
&quot;Who are you and where did you come from!&quot; Jeff asked suddenly on high alert.<br />
&quot;Last I recall, Mike, my coworker was letting me, um... become one with him, over my lunch break...He was going to, uhh... release me, right after so I could punch back in after an hour. Very last thing I remember was his cell phone started to ring and he silenced it. I woke up here, you thought I was Mike. I assumed something happened and he&#39;d come back and explain, but I have no idea where he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shared a look with his mother, &quot;Oh, um... we&#39;re gonna need our bathroom back. Could you grab a towel or something from under the sink and come out? The clothes in there are my dad&#39;s and he&#39;s gonna need them.&quot;<br />
<br />
A moment later the hallway was uncomfortably crowded as a stranger was escorted to the living room in a bath towel, and Jeff scuttled into the restroom with everyone knowing he was about to masturbate. <br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t know what made him think his dad would be returned first, he just sort of imagined Dean at the &quot;bottom&quot; of his testicles and his dad at the top having presumably following the last in first out rules... maybe it worked like that, maybe not, this is a whole new world after all.<br />
<br />
After a little more effort Jeff came again and left the light on torn about putting deans clothes in there somewhere, just in case. He decided he would cross that bridge if necessary and went to the living room where his mom was interrogating the stranger on the nature of his and her husband&#39;s relationship. Oddly enough, he was ignoring the icy stare and politely explaining his lifestyle, similar to taking a nap during lunch break rather than eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not much different than asking your husband to do a simple dance he knows... like &#39;I&#39;m a little teapot&#39; or something like that. I do my part, he&#39;s willing to do his. Its simple as that. Now I know some people have lots of feelings tied up with cummification, but for me its just a bit of R&R, and for him, I&#39;d guess its the same, though, much shorter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could see his mom needed to be angry at someone for everything and this man was an easy target. She was trying to turn it into some sexual perversion to make the sudden chaos make sense. The man just pleasantly reiterated that there was nothing sexual about it and it was more like a rejuvenating spa day that didn&#39;t leave him sleepy, all in an hour. His mom had gone through the gambit of emotions tonight and wanted more than happenstance to blame this craziness on.<br />
<br />
Jeff went back to the bathroom grabbing the keys from Dad&#39;s pocket, unable to resist looking and finding a guinea pig sized mass forming at the back of the tub. <br />
<br />
Jeff came back to the living room, the man was congenial as ever, and his mom was putting up a strong front trying to find answers this guy just didn&#39;t have. &quot;Hey,&quot; Jeff held up the keys. &quot;Obviously my dad trusts you enough for... well... So I&#39;m going to get you home. You can bring the towel back to dad when he&#39;s back at work... He just lost his brother and seems to have forgotten about your arrangement given the news, so, I apologize on his behalf, but this might take a bit of time to deal with before he returns to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man was amenable to the plan and seemed eager to leave despite seeming nothing but blissfully unaware of the household chaos. Jeff looked at his mom, &quot;We don&#39;t know how dad&#39;s going to be, maybe you should have a glass of wine in preparation? He might be able to open up easier with a beer or two? Either way, I&#39;ll be back soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Jeff left the house, toweled man in tow, questioning when he became the family mediator. Along the ride Jeff focused on explaining what happened to this guy, divulging that he had been absorbed by Jeff when his dad needed to get away. They arrived, the man who was named Jack, thanked and applauded him profusely for handling his mother in the state she was in. Jack noticed that Mike had been mindful enough to grab the guy&#39;s clothes which were in the back seat, Jeff let him back in to change and leave the towel in the car.<br />
<br />
Jeff asked his own questions about the process now that the man was actually leaving. He wondered what it&#39;s like, and how it feels. The answers weren&#39;t quite satisfactory with good and so peaceful being the primary descriptors. Jeff thanked him for the insight and wished him well, heading back home. <br />
<br />
Jeff entered the house to find...</p>
