<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer begrudgingly began looking at the various mannequins with Lana following right behind her. Lana&#39;s hands were still wrapped around her own erection, which has poked Jennifer in her ass more than a few times now.<br />
<br />
There were all sorts of different dresses. From long, flowing gowns, to the tiniest of all bodycon mini dresses. Some were made of latex, some were sheer, some even could be considered more of a longer kind of lingerie than a dress in her opinion, and some even looked simply like large, oversized tshirts. There were quite a few elegant dresses, and even some party/cocktail dresses too. But nothing really caught her attention yet. That is until she turned down the 7th aisle and was met with the first dress of its kind that she had ever came across. It was made of latex, and looked to be quite tight too. However, that isn&#39;t what snagged her attention.<br />
<br />
The key features of this outfit was how it emphasizes the assets. To begin with, the breasts would be held up and directly forwards by a special type of built in corset. They would remain in place, but the nipples were practically on full display and were actually being held by a very thin loop each. The nipples themselves were completely uncovered too though. The other feature, is the dresses&#39; cock sleeve. It literally contours to every nook and cranny, holding the wearer&#39;s penis directly out and forwards, whether they are erect or not. Even the best are wrapped by the latex material, and hang separately from the dress. It looks as if someone literally just wrapped the wearer&#39;s erect cock and balls in the same latex material and then just attached it to the dress front seamlessly. <br />
<br />
Jennifer couldn&#39;t not stare at such an unusual dress. When she circled around it, she found that the dresses&#39; built in posture collar even had a metal ring on the back side, and 2 loops which the wearer&#39;s wrists could be bound with, restraining their arms behind their back. And when not in use, the straps could be tied like a ribbon/bow. Jennifer was about to walk away and continue looking when Lana grabbed her wrist. <br />
<br />
--Hold on, let me help you get this one on.-- said Lana as she handed the unusual dress to Jennifer. --Go to that changing room and wait for me, I will be there in a second.--<br />
<br />
With the looming threat of the remote hanging over her ass, Jennifer couldn&#39;t argue back and accepted the outfit, then went directly into the changing room Lana had pointed to. Inside, Jennifer gazed as herself, admiring her beauty, but also dispising the fact that she is also the person in the reflection. 2 minutes later, Lana walks in, carrying a shoebox with her, as well as a key and a smaller, clear box with 2 metal rings inside.<br />
<br />
--Well don&#39;t wait for me to strip you.-- Lana said as she set down the shoe box. Jennifer undressed herself, removing her shoes as well as her underwear, until she was fully naked. Lana then helps her into the dress, tightening the corset around her waist as Jennifer fits her cock and balls into the sleeve when it is fully inside, the material begins shrinking around her cock, until it is skin tight, but not so tight that it is uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
--The material is heat sensitive.-- explains Lana as she finishes tightening the corset. Jennifer never felt so constricted before. She could barely take a step. Maybe at most a foot in stride length, and only if she tried to stretch against the material as hard as she could. Her waist is so thin looking now too. She wondered if it was OK to be like this for a long time. Her arms were difficult to raise, and she could forget about ever raising them above her shoulders. And while breathing wasn&#39;t as difficult as she had kind of expected it to be, it was still just slightly harder to do, especially if she tried to take a really deep breath. <br />
<br />
Her ass looked absolutely amazing however, even if you could see just the small hint of her anal plug being pressed into the latex. The dress also was surprisingly breathable too, and Jennifer was not nearly as sweaty and sticky as she thought she would be.<br />
<br />
This is when things went downhill. Lana approached her from behind and while Jennifer was distracted, she wrapped her arms around her torso from behind and quickly pierced both of Jennifer&#39;s nipples with a pair of large, golden rings. Jennifer grunted in pain, which was all she could do as Lana turned on her anal plug and covered her mouth. Pain soon turned into pleasure for Jennifer and she settled down a bit, but was still quite pissed off by her unwanted new body piercings. <br />
<br />
--You&#39;re fine. And you need them in or the loops in the corset won&#39;t hold your boobs inplace and will just slip right off your nipples. Plus I can see how hard your erection is right now. Your body is far more honest than you are being Jennifer-- taunted Lana. Jennifer wanted to say something, but Lana was right. She was harder than a rock right now, and didn&#39;t even know fully why either. Sure the vib in her ass helped her get an erection, sure, but never this much. <br />
<br />
Lana opened the shoe box and brought out a pair of ballet ankle boots in a matching color. She put them on Jennifer&#39;s feet and then locked them with the key. Jennifer&#39;s feet felt so constricted now, and it somewhat hurt a bit to stand up. Lana helped her to find her balance though. <br />
<br />
--Lana, what the hell is this dress?-- <br />
<br />
--What? Don&#39;t you know what a hobble dress is?-- Lana then explains the basics around a hobble outfit, and gives Jennifer a few tips on how to walk in one. Jennifer wanted to take it off, but Lana was now convinced that this was the perfect dress for her step-daughter after seeing how good her ass, cock, waist, and tits looked in it. And with how everything jiggled slightly with each tiny step she took,  even Kelly had to agree that her step-sister was a massive hobbling turn on now. Even Jennifer was turned on by her own appearance so much so that she already came once, back filling her cock sleeve with cum to the point it began pooling in her ball pouch, making it appear even bigger as it expanded in size to contain her massive load. And thanks to a special flap that could be fixed to her piercings, her nipples could be covered up with a special piercing cover, making her outfit publicly &quot;acceptable&quot; in terms of undecency. Though it was heavily pushing that line.</p>
