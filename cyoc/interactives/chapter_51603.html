<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Standing in front of the door, ready to step through the threshold, you see... Ben, 
your new neighbor on the cruise ship standing at your door. At first, you were in shock, 
since you didn't expect to see him this quickly and not to mention seeing him in his 
awesome birthday suit. Everything about him, that you could tell from his tighter clothing, 
was there for you to see in vivid detail. He was as well muscled as you could tell, not 
chiseled but voluptuous, flat stomach, thighs as thick as tree trunks, calves that looked as 
though they could move him very quickly anytime he needed, biceps that were as big 
around as basketballs. Ben was three hundred and forty pounds of muscle godliness, that 
was also not afraid of having man fur or a nice cock and balls to match.</Br>
<Br>"So... are you going to stare at me all day, or are you going to let me in?" He asked 
with a wry smile.</Br>
<Br>Without hesitation, you stepped off to the side and let him in. As Ben walked by you, 
you could not help thinking to yourself <Em>Thank you God!</Em> while closing the 
door. When you turned around, you could see that Ben was already laying on your bed, 
sprawled out comfortably, his cock laying limp and resting on his massive left thigh. As 
you walk toward Ben, he just looks at you with your clothes on and smiles wryly 
again.</Br>
<Br>"So Brandon, you must be new to the cruise line since you don't look like any 
of the other guys here."</Br>
<Br>Slightly confused, you raise your eyebrow and speak while walking over to the bed. 
"No, I have never been on this cruise before and what do you mean since I don't look like 
any of the other guys?"</Br>
<Br>"Well... first thing is first, welcome. You are going to really enjoy your stay, I know I 
did the first time I came onto this cruise line a few weeks ago." He said, gently patting you 
on the back.</Br>
<Br>"So, you have been on this cruise before then Ben?"</Br>
<Br>"Oh yeah, several times! I have met several great guys here. Now I know what you 
must be thinking, how can that be if this line is new... right?"</Br>
<Br>You just nod silently.</Br>
<Br>"Well... this cruise line used to be a part of the Atlantis cruises for gay men. This is 
the fourth week this cruise line has actually been separated from their parent company. I 
have even been on this very boat before, even on this deck, since this was one of the 
Atlantis boats. The thing is, the first week of this cruise, I stayed on this deck, but the 
rooms were nothing like they are now."</Br>
<Br>"Why are they different?"</Br>
<Br>"The same reason I stayed on other decks. They wanted to remodel the rooms to fit 
this line's new theme. I'll even let you in on a little secret they don't tell you on the 
brochure. This cruise line offers transformative options and this deck is by far the best 
choice!"</Br>
<Br>"What exactly do you mean Ben?"</Br>
<Br>"Here, I'll show ya!" Ben pulled out his wallet, grabbed a photo and handed it to you. 
"Brandon, that was me before the first time I came on this boat, to this deck."</Br>
<Br>You looked down at the photo, up at him, back down and then back up. What you 
saw was beyond belief. The Ben in the photo was an average guy, slight belly, slight chest 
arm and leg definition, with a light dusting of man hair... but nothing like the Ben before 
you now. You knew it was him because the face and head were the same, but everything 
else was different. If you didn't have a brain, you would have believed him, but it looked 
like a ohotoshop job.</Br>
<Br>"Ben, I see the resemblance, but I can't believe this is you! I mean, come on... you 
look like two different men!"</Br>
<Br>"Believe me Brandon, that was and is me. You will find out tonight that I am telling 
the truth... one way or another!"</Br>
<Br>Just then, you heard the horn of the boat sound off, signifying you were leaving port 
and heading to your first cruise destination. The lock on the door to the outer hall locked 
and you knew you were on this thing till the very end. Not really knowing what you had 
gotten yourself into, you just look at Ben.</Br>
<Br>"Awe, come on buddy, don't look like that. There are only a few hours till the sun 
goes down and the real fun begins."</Br>
<Br>"Wha... what is going to happen then?" You ask, stuttering nervously.</Br>
<Br>"Well... I will tell you that you will go from the average you now, to the new you that 
will look a lot like I do. Then, something else will happen and I am not going to tell you, 
since it will spoil the surprise. Oh, I would also like to tell you that you will want to take 
your clothes off since when you start growing, it will only make it more painful than it 
needs to be. Trust me... I learned the hard way."</Br>
<Br>Not sure if he was delusional or just horny and wanted a piece of tail, you weren't 
going to ignore the advice he gave. You started undressing, taking off each layer, little by 
little as Ben just watched. A few times during your undressing, he gave out a few wolf 
whistles, which were pretty close to the old loony tunes cartoons. Once you were 
undressed and standing in all of your naked glory, he gave you a once over. You were 
average, having a light tan, slight muscle definition, a little man fur and so on. You 
chuckled to yourself, looking at the photo you still had of the old him. You realized that 
you looked like that photo in appearance and if Ben wasn't lying, tonight would be very 
interesting.</Br>
<Br>"Well Brandon, you definitely do put on one hell of a show. In fact, you took the 
couple of hours that we had left showing off... whether or not it was for me is beside the 
point, but now we have but minutes to your initial change.</Br></p>
