<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Great, so you need to learn how to deal with strange people, especially our customers.&quot; Ondine said<br />
<br />
&quot;The first thing you should know is that not everyone likes to be weird, there are those who don&#39;t feel good about this condition and want to be normal, and this is even more true with those who were born normal, as many have difficulty accepting the that they have become.&quot; Molly said<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were born this way.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t, we&#39;re not even sisters.  Molly and I have been friends since childhood and one day we decided to prepare a surprise for her grandmother to celebrate her birthday.&quot; Lara said<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a little surprise party that we threw at her house while my parents entertained her elsewhere.  The surprise worked, but not in the way we had hoped. It turns out that my grandmother is a witch and she got scared the moment we revealed the surprise, thinking that there were thieves in the house she threw a curse without thinking and when she realized it was us it was already too late.&quot; Molly said<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember like it was yesterday, we saw her walk in and before we could reveal the surprise party purple flames erupted towards us, our clothes were burned and our bodies merged into one, our pussy disappeared and our dick grew together with our balls.&quot; Lara said<br />
<br />
&quot;If she realized the mistake she couldn&#39;t have undone it?&quot; you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;She tried, but curses are often difficult to undo even for those who apply them, so she had to do a lot of research to find out how to undo the curse she had placed on us.&quot; Molly said<br />
<br />
&quot;We couldn&#39;t go out to the room where she and Molly&#39;s parents took us for a long time.  It turns out that when the curse was applied to us it left us with balls so big that we were totally unable to move. When our balls grew they were on top of us and were too heavy for us to lift, after they helped us turn around they turned out to be so big that we were on top of them and our legs were unable to touch the ground.&quot; Lara said<br />
<br />
&quot;After almost a year she finally figured out how to undo the curse, but me and Lara had started to enjoy sharing a body and we didn&#39;t want to be separated, we also liked having our cock, so we asked my grandmother to just shrink the our balls to a size that won&#39;t get in the way.&quot; Molly said<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are mutants today because you want to?&quot; you asked, and Lara and Molly confirmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;With us it was very different, we had no choice.  Sarah and I didn&#39;t even know each other well, it&#39;s just that we were at the same camp when we were 16 and we were on the same team on a treasure hunt game in a nearby forest.&quot; Ondine said<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember this, we found a little doll trapped under a rock almost completely covered in mud.  I took her out of there, and the doll was actually a fairy who was very weak and thanked us saying that she would grant a wish for each of us as a reward.&quot; Sarah said<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t believe it and we thought it was just a toy with pre-recorded phrases used to play some prank on us and that&#39;s why I wished that Sarah had giant breasts since she was comparing the mees being bigger than hers, and that she had a extra pair the same size in the back so the weight wouldn&#39;t hurt her spine from the front, and she wished I was her cock.  This was our mistake, because the little doll was a real fairy and she flew staggering into the woods saying that she would fulfill our wishes as soon as she regained strength, and three days later when I woke up I was already Sarah&#39;s dick and she already had those huge breasts.&quot; Ondine said<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a surprise to wake up and see the new additions to my body, but it&#39;s not that bad, I kind of like it.&quot; Sarah said<br />
<br />
&quot;Only you think that, I don&#39;t like your pee coming out of my mouth whenever you go to piss, since the fairy kept your pussy you could piss throught it, and I would also like to have my independence back.&quot; Ondine said<br />
<br />
&quot;You can say it but I know you love it when I stroke you, the way you act when I do won&#39;t let you lie.&quot; Sarah said and Ondine blushed<br />
<br />
&quot;Now enough talking about us.&quot; Ondine said, finishing the memories and turning to you &quot;The important thing is that there are those who were born mutants and there are those who became mutants, either by some kind of magic like us or due to science, victims of some accident or some experiment that went wrong. Strangely the only change that is common in everyone is in the heightened libido.  It&#39;s not enough to get in the way of our daily life, yet it&#39;s much higher than that of normal people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before Ondine told us this high libido fact Molly and I didn&#39;t understand why we didn&#39;t care about other people seeing us naked after we&#39;d been cursed.&quot; Lara said<br />
<br />
&quot;We even got excited when we saw someone trying to look under our skirt or trying to undress us mentally, and the surprise on their faces when they noticed the bulge in our clothes growing with our erection.&quot; Molly said<br />
<br />
&quot;You can talk about it later.  Now Sarah, give him the list of young people who will start arriving tomorrow.&quot; Ondine said<br />
<br />
You received the entries and saw that there was a field called &#39;level of contagion&#39; and numbers ranging from 0 to 5.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does the level of contagion mean?&quot; you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s because there are those who can cause the transformation of another who comes to ingest it mainly with their sexual fluids, either swallowing it or with them coming inside. Level 0 indicates that they are not infectious, so you can interact with them at will and nothing will happen to you.&quot; Sarah said<br />
<br />
&quot;Level 1&#39;s are very non-contagious and can only cause another to transform if the contact is prolonged, so once or twice it won&#39;t do anything.  This level is subdivided into type A and type B, because type a turns you into the same person who infected you, while type B is more unpredictable and causes a seemingly random transformation.&quot; Lara said<br />
<br />
&quot;Level 2 is almost the same as level 1, but a single dose of the mutant&#39;s fluids is enough to cause a mutation. Up to this level only normal people can be affected and those who are already mutants are totally immune.&quot; Molly said<br />
<br />
&quot;Level 3 is also subdivided into type A and B and works like lower levels, but other mutants are also affected and transform again.&quot; Ondine said<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it&#39;s at level 4 that the thing gets complicated, because all the lower levels the mutant that infects you makes you transform only once to make you immune to them, but at level 4 that doesn&#39;t happen.  Every time you end up having the fluid of some level 4 placed inside your body, you go through a new transformation.&quot; Molly said<br />
<br />
&quot;Level 5 is the highest and rarest ever recorded and reaches the point of not being a simple contagion.  At this level sexual fluids have such a high transformative property that even the mutant to which they belong is not immune and undergoes a new mutation if ingested.&quot; Ondine said<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so you know, both me and Ondine and Lara and Molly are contagion level 0.&quot; Sarah said<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to know, although I&#39;m only here for work, not for sex.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;You may say it now, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be tempted at some point.  If you feel like it, you don&#39;t need to be shy, you can invite the anybody you feel attracted to and you will almost certainly have what you want.&quot; Molly said<br />
<br />
&quot;And as we warned you, our libido is much higher than normal, so don&#39;t be surprised if you come across someone masturbating or having sex, since most likely they don&#39;t mind being found and can invite you to join them, which you&#39;re perfectly free to do if you want. And here the regulations allow this as long as it is consensual.&quot; Lara said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think that&#39;s all you need to know for now.  Since the customers will start arriving tomorrow and the preparations are ready, you can take the rest of the day off.&quot; Ondine said<br />
<br />
Before they left Sarah turned to you and said &quot;The camp team is having a get-together right now and we&#39;re going there now.  Do you want to go too or do you prefer to stay here and rest?&quot;<br />
<br />
You...</p>
