<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The squad&#39;s superior read over their reports. To say he was unhappy was an understatement. While it was supposed to be a scouting mission it still ended with losing one of his men. Colt pinched his nose before he got up and walked through a door. He then walked down the hall to the lab.  <br />
<br />
Doctor Avery was busy analyzing the footage from the group&#39;s body cams. Thomas&#39;s camera was lost. Cynthia was surprised when Colt burst through the doors. &quot;Avery, what happened?&quot; he was not in the mood for small talk. John turned his chair and spoke, &quot;The energy surrounding the site is more concentrated than the energy we previously saw. As a result the protective suits couldn&#39;t handle it&quot; he then fast-forwarded the footage to show the gun becoming the creature and the wilderness expand. &quot;from what I&#39;ve seen the longer this lasts the more land it&#39;ll cover.&quot; the doctor said.  <br />
<br />
Colt was not pleased by this at all. &quot;any idea what we are fighting?&quot; looking at the map showing the area. &quot;no, what&#39;s worse by my estimate it will reach the city within a few days&quot; Suddenly the location on the map shown to be the chaotic wilderness expanded before slowing down. &quot;or within the hour&quot; john gulped. Sally burst into the room a few moments later. &quot;sir, there&#39;s something at the front gate&quot; Sally said. Colt looked at the doctor. &quot;make us a way to get to the center of that and stop it or I&#39;ll throw you to those spores myself&quot; It was an empty threat but it did its job.  <br />
<br />
Arriving at the front gate he saw a group of his men surrounding something. &quot;it just walked up and put its hands up&quot; a soldier said as he backed away to reveal a blocky humanoid rabbit robot. &quot;who are you, what is your purpose?&quot; Colt demanded. The bot blinked as it pointed under its eyes. Displeased Colt ordered it to be taken to Doctor Avery. Afterward, he put in a call with the mayor of Las Sombra and ordered an immediate evacuation. He knew it was unlikely everyone would be able to get out within such a time restraint but it was all he could do right now. Little did he know that the energy bursts changing people would become more frequent before the wilderness arrived. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Just a few minutes before the surge, workers on a farm were busy tending to it. On the eastern side of the property, Ash was busy tending to the bees. He had to be careful when collecting the honey. He had to smoke them slightly to avoid them. However too much and he could end up killing them and getting fired. He was so focused on smoking them that he didn&#39;t notice a yellow energy rush straight toward him. he was thrown through the beehives and his suit was torn. He didn&#39;t know what that was, but he feared for the worst when the bees swarmed him.  <br />
<br />
However, instead of feeling pain, he felt something weird. Looking at his exposed suit his eyes widened as the bees flew right into him. His skin rippled like a stone dropping into a puddle each time. Before long every single bee, even the queen&#39;s had absorbed into him. Just when he thought that was it his body began to grow. It wasn&#39;t painful, it felt like being dipped in warm honey. Through the now-growing tears in his beekeeper outfit, yellow fur covered his skin. Then black stripes and marks filled in where the yellow wasn&#39;t. His shoes broke apart like butter revealing three yellow claws had replaced his toes. The inner ones were a bit smaller than the others but still huge. Connected to them was black fur giving the illusion of boots. Curved stripes appeared above them on his yellow fur as a diamond mark appeared on his knees, and black marks also appeared on the back. By this point, his clothes couldn&#39;t take his muscular body and broke completely. This revealed a black front covering most of his front with his yellow fur cutting down long thin triangles to where his nipples used to be. Under his arms, a set of nubs rapidly grew into a second pair. They were mostly yellow with black hands. A curved mark was on his shoulders and forearms. Unlike his lower hands, his uppers were a deep yellow. Black tufts jutted from the elbows. He let out a moan of discomfort as he was forced to stand. A large bee&#39;s abdomen grew. It looked identical to the ones on all the bees he&#39;s cared for. From his back a pair of insect wings grew, they were clear and in the right light seemed to become invisible. Where his neck met his body a large mane of white fur grew. The black fur grew over his lower jaw as his mouth pushed out. His lips became jagged lines as his teeth disappeared. To compensate the skin on his mouth grew hard. his blond hair soon became the same fur as two antennae grew above his shrinking ears. The whites of his eyes became honey-colored while his irises and pupils became a soft yellow. Finally, his eyebrows became black.  <br />
<br />
Ash raised his hands as he looked at his body. Despite this drastic change he still felt like him. he could move every part of his body like he always had it. With the mere thought of his wings moving he found he hovered a bit of the ground. &quot;*BZZT* wow, this iz amazing&quot; Ash found himself occasionally buzzing and every s sounded like a buzz. &quot;hey, *BZZT* what about my...&quot; Ash used his lower hands to feel his crotch. he patted it for a few moments only to come up empty. He then felt nature calling and wondered where it would end up. He then felt his abdomen contract and relax as pee came out of it. &quot;well *BZZT* that answers that queztion&quot; he said.  <br />
<br />
The 7&#39;2 bee anthro then felt the ground shake. He used his wings to get a foot off the ground to avoid the tremors. At the edge of the property, a weird-looking jungle was sprouting. Even in all the documentaries he watched Ash had never seen plants like those. Once it got to the fence line vines wrapped around them. To Ash&#39;s shock, the fence transformed before his very eyes. Some parts of it were jagged rocks while others were plants. A few even became glowing mushrooms taller than him. The ground sprouted grass of varying colors. The destroyed beehives were absorbed by the forest before reforming into a throne made of beeswax and wood. The beehive&#39;s ash hadn&#39;t been thrown into then began growing and becoming more natural. They then merged around him and covered the ground under his floating body.  <br />
<br />
Ash was pushed to the new floor as it rushed up. Beyond the new room he was in he saw he was now in a honey-filled palace. The bees from the undestroyed hives were now grown to five feet and taken on a feminine appearance. One of them timidly approached Ash &quot;My BZZT king what iz your bidding&quot;. Ash was taken aback by this. In nature there was no king bee, then again the worker bees were usually male. With a bit of courage, he spoke &quot;Um... BZZT what happened?&quot; he noted their confusion. &quot;perhaps the king izz unwell&quot; one of the more confident bee women said. She then began messaging his large abdomen. He let out a buzz of enjoyment and everyone took that as a sign to pleasure him. Soon Ash was in pure bliss as he enjoyed his new kingdom. His palace now hung 70 feet off the ground and was connected to a giant tree.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Across the farm, the same things were happening as the chaotic wilderness spread. The fences became various things as they changed. The silo became a massive plant covered in berries, from a far enough distance it looked vaguely like a cornstalk. The barn became a giant cave. The house then decayed like it had been built centuries ago and was on its last legs. The chaotic wilderness had more concentrated energy than the blasts. With it, the minds of those it hits could be either partially or completely lost.  <br />
<br />
Dylan the farmer&#39;s youngest son was petting their cat when the forest rushed through their land. The two merged leaving an anthro calico cat lady in a set of clothes too small for her. Around her, the boy&#39;s room began to root as the window shattered. Plants and moss grew throughout the room as a gaping hole ate his chair and desk. The feline gripped his head as his memories of Dylan and his cat were lost. The only thing the beast knew now was hunger. It sniffed the air and got off the moldy mattress, the bed frame snapping as she leapt to the window. On the patchy roof, she spied the solution to her hunger, a bunch of avian beasts bound to the ground. The feline gripped the vine of a nearby tree and slid down. She tried being stealthy but a rooster creature spotted her and alerted them. With stealth gone the cat lady began chasing chicken-like creatures looking for a meal.  <br />
<br />
Farmer Brown was riding his horse Buzz to the stable when he got spooked. His wife ran to him screaming as unnatural plants grew behind her. he hoisted her up as the plants surrounded him. However, they weren&#39;t safe as mushrooms realized spores that completely engulfed them. His clothing was eaten away as he fell off the horse. Simon gripped his sides as he shrank to the size of a kid. Fur and curved horns grew as he became an anthro goat. He looked almost like one except for a frog tongue that constantly hung out of his mouth. He then saw the centaur before him. The reason his wife hadn&#39;t fallen off was because she had merged with Buzz. She now had replaced his head and neck. Her ears were pointed and her hair transitioned into a mane. Her breasts were now enormous and she had a thick forest of body hair everywhere on her human part except her face and neck. Due to the spores they had lost their intelligence and became feral beasts. The goat mutant used his tongue to pleasure the cock of the centaur that used to be his wife and prized stallion.  <br />
<br />
Their daughter Molly was throwing feed to the chickens when the wilderness grew around them. The feed became rainbow-colored stalks half her height. They hid a mushroom that she soon stepped on. She coughed as the chickens were going crazy. She felt something hit her as she had the most explosive orgasm ever. Stepping out of the stalks revealed Molly had merged with the rooster and became a herm hybrid half their original height. They had a mostly masculine body except for six breasts and a pussy under their cock. Their entire body was covered in feathers and had the head and feet of the rooster. The beast they weren&#39;t safe and saw a creature approaching from their left. They got in front of their flock and were guarding against it. They were now protecting their hens from the cat lady in torn clothing.  <br />
<br />
Wally the farmer&#39;s eldest son was sitting on the back porch with Max the family&#39;s dog. When he saw the chaotic wilderness approach he ran inside to try and get his younger brother. As he headed for the steps the house began to age and rot. The pictures on the wall fell and broke. The couch looked like rodents had torn it up for decades. Then the steps collapsed as he was running up them. The debris hit the mushrooms. Wally coughed as the spore transformed him. His male attributes were replaced with female ones. Fur soon covered him as he lost his hands. As Wally lost his mind she was turned into a female black lab. By comparison, a completely normal dog was the strangest thing to come out of the chaos. Something then kicked down the brittle door. While she had become a dog, their dog became an anthro Cerberus. His three heads grinned at the bitch in heat. He plunged his cock into her and the two had been mating non-stop since their changes happened.  <br />
<br />
The workers fared no better. The craziest was one of their female workers combined with every cow they had. The result was a twenty-foot-tall Minotaur. Thankfully he remained on all fours despite his humanoid appearance. He wasn&#39;t even the only one to have this gender change. However, their changes didn&#39;t require merging with livestock. Instead, this female worker transformed into a humanoid boar. He then went to town with all the pigs. They squealed before all becoming anthro pig women after he fucked them, even the other boars on the farm. Another female worker ended up merging with a rabbit. Thankfully she was able to remain female. She then had the male rabbit plunge his now human cock into her pussy.  <br />
<br />
All of these were witnessed by Ash&#39;s drones. Coming back from recognizing they informed him of the creatures surrounding their palace. Ash was distraught to learn the fate of his boss&#39;s family and coworkers. That being said the king thing did help a bit. &quot;head *BZZT* wezt, zee if you can locate any zentient creaturez and inform them of my location. We will need alliez to protect our kingdom&quot; Ash said. &quot;yez lord azhford *BZZT*&quot; his drone ladies said before flying off. he then was fed more delicious honey by a bee servant. If his house in the city was still there then maybe he could get his drones to bring his stuff here, after all a king needs his things. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay doc, can you tell us why you needed to see us?&quot; Kent asked. He and his team had been deemed fit for duty so they were planning on going back to the wilderness to find the source and put a stop to it if possible. Then Doctor Avery told them and Colt to come to the lab. Setting on the table was the robot from earlier. &quot;well it has to do with X here.&quot; he gestured to the robot. It waved with a slight change to its eyes making them look like smile faces. &quot;X?&quot; Colt asked. The bot nodded. &quot;it&#39;s what the robot seems to respond to. Anyway, I managed to access X&#39;s memory files and found this&quot; Doctor Avery then showed the footage of the group driving off. he began rewinding the footage to show the robots trek back to the the volcano&#39;s base. Then the footage became corrupted before the last corrupted image showed a pair of human hands grabbing a backpack as it exploded.  <br />
<br />
&quot;from what I&#39;ve gathered X here did something to cause this. It has no memories of what but shows signs of guilt&quot; As Avery spoke the Bots ears drooped. Its eyes became crying emojis. &quot;but it had made up for it with this information&quot; Avery then switched to a diagnostic of X. &quot;X&#39;s entire body is shielded from the energy which I have dubbed cosmic&quot; The others were not amused by Avery naming the energy. Even X gave an un-amused emoji before his eyes returned to normal.  <br />
<br />
&quot;*cough* anyway by analyzing X I am building exo-suits for your group that should theoretically protect you,&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;theoretically?&quot; Abigail said.&quot;what about the creatures, with what happened to Thomas and his weapon there&#39;s no question there will be beasts in those woods?&quot; Sam said. Before Avery could answer Colt was once again called to the front gate. Everyone followed him, even X. They then saw two female bee anthros greeting them. &quot;can *BZZT* you understand uz,&quot; one of them said.  <br />
<br />
Nodding Colt spoke &quot;My name is Colonel Colt Smithers. Who am I speaking to&quot; Colt said. The drones introduced themselves. &quot;we are mere dronez of King Azhford *BZZT*&quot; they said in unison. Then one of them continued &quot;he zent uz on a *BZZT* mission to find other zentient lifefromz and report back. He requeztz thoze capable of joining him at hiz palace eazt of here, we will not return without a willing volunteer&quot; She said. It was risky, if they left now they might risk being changed, however, the suits would take time, and if they took too long then the entire city could fall, then the world. They didn&#39;t even know if this Ashford was a good creature or not. Colt then decided on the course of action.</p>
