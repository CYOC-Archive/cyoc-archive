<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;God, coach makes us drink so much. Well, she makes us need alcohol, yes, but she&#39;s such a hard ass on the whole water and hydration thing. I have to pee all the time, in fact, I should probably go now before practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Emma! You&#39;re so brisk, I love it. I don&#39;t know anyone else with the confidence to talk about themselves like that! I better let you do your business though... see you tonight!&quot; Emma&#39;s friend Kelsey waved good-bye and walked towards the school&#39;s main entrance. Emma&#39;s gaze lingered a little on her petite ass... why hadn&#39;t she tried out for cross country, too? It&#39;d be a great way to stay busy and get more fresh air. Besides, Emma wouldn&#39;t mind sharing a locker room with her... that body had been on her mind ever since she arrived.<br />
<br />
Because no one really knew her well yet, Emma tried to use the less-crowded girl&#39;s bathrooms in the school. This made her hydration habit all the more annoying, but it was the only way she felt comfortable doing her business. She climbed the stairs, making her way to the science wing on the third floor. On her walk there, she saw no one, and it appeared that all of the science teachers had already left for the evening, rather than sticking around to work on grades or whatever. Some sort of conference, probably. Emma was delighted to be able to be herself.<br />
<br />
She turned the corner into the bathroom and had to muffle her scream - seeing Jen laying soggily on the floor like the used fuckthing she had been for Kyle startled her. It also made her kind of horny, especially when she got to imagining- she brushed the idea away quickly. She was just here to piss, and heaven knows how hard that is with a massive boner. Sliding her panties aside, she dropped her dick out into the billow of her skirt as she walked towards the stall.<br />
<br />
Jen had been woken by the noise, and lay dazed and confused, trying to make sense of her surroundings. However, her eyes stayed closed until, by coincidence, the moment Emma was stepping over her. Looking up, she saw Emma&#39;s drop her snake from its usual location, tucked behind her pussy, and saw it jiggle as it fell out of her hand. Her pussy started to feel warm again, and her legs slowly prepared themselves to stand again, despite their utter exhaustion.<br />
<br />
By the time the final drops of Emma&#39;s clear urine hit the toilet water, Jen was on her feet, nipple in hand. She waited by the stall door for Emma to open it, and when Emma tried to come out, Jen pushed her back to sit on the toilet. Emma struggled against her force, trying to keep her t shirt clear of Jen&#39;s milky breasts, until the moment that her dick was in Jen&#39;s mouth. Still floppy, it curved downards with weight and then upwards into Jen&#39;s hands, which were stroking her shaft with a twisting motion. Emma groaned as she felt herself swell - however, she didn&#39;t get hard yet. Something about the encounter resonated with her biology, spurring on tussue growth. Her dick felt heavier, and she looked down at it briefly. It must have been 14 inches long, and as thick as her fist. She felt the bottom part of it dip into the toilet water.<br />
<br />
Jen looked up at her then, her lips stretched in an attempt to fit the engorged head. Emma met her eyes and shuddered, finally feeling her bloodflow change. Her tits expanded against her sports bra, her cute little nipples and areola leaving an outline visible through her shirt. She took the shirt off and rubbed the soft fabric of her supports, feeling her boobs sink into her armpits as she laid back and fondled them. While still nothing compared to Jen&#39;s, they had expanded past their usual B cup while staying nice and perky.<br />
<br />
Her dick hardened in Jen&#39;s grip until it was straight as a log. Never before had so much of her blood rushed to fill her member, amd she began to feel dizzy. Jen soon found new ways to use her hands, working them along Emma&#39;s cock for several minutes. Her tongue continued to make itself useful.<br />
<br />
After a while, it became apparent to Jen that this monster cock would not burst as easily as Kyle had, and though she was still shaking from fatigue in her legs, she got up again and wrapped her thighs around it, feeling her juices flow against its head. With her hands she continued to jerk Emma off, a task which now took two hands to surround her completely.<br />
<br />
Emma added her hands to it and came without warning, splattering her cum against the stall door. Her orgasm was prolonged by the sight of it dripping down onto the floor, and she spewed for around a minute before relaxing her own efforts and allowing her cumshot to peter off. Her conciousness began to feel heavier again, as blood from her erection was freed up to her brain. Even though her cock had softened, it maintained its size, and Jen still had work to do. She straddled Emma, her milky tits swinging into her face, and orgasmed as she squeezed her tits up and down on Emma&#39;s floppy cock. She grabbed Emma&#39;s dick by the head and forced it into Emma&#39;s own mouth. It had never been long enough for her to suck it before, and even though the taste and sensation were new, she pleasured herself eagerly. Precum soon dribbled down her neck and onto her sports bra, which was started to get soaked by Jen&#39;s nipple flow.<br />
<br />
Jen pushed Emma&#39;s head down between her milky tits, nearly choking her on her own dick in the process. Emma, unlike Kyle, had lost no senstivity, and thick loads of cum started to dribble from her dick tip. Swallowing it turned her on even more, and as her dick started to get hard again she blasted the roof of her mouth. She gagged on her jizz and pulled out. She painted her face and chest white on the way to the bowl, letting herself unload into the cool water while four hands worked her shaft.<br />
<br />
Jen tried to stand, but to little avail, and fell to the ground helplessly. In a last-ditch effort to further incite Emma&#39;s orgasms, she reached her mouth to her nipples and came. Her pussy squirted to the bottom of the toilet bowl, and the left nipple dribbled milk as the right shot into the air, much of it landing back on her body. It did not prove to be enough for Emma, who nervously watched her cock shrink back to a concealable size. It had never been so big, and she hoped it was the first of many massive hard-ons for her. <br />
<br />
After four minutes had passed, Emma was cleaned up and ready to go home. She would be late to practice, so it was more worth her time to skip. Surely coach would understand that she had to relieve herself; what exactly was being relieved was irrelevant. Stepping over Jen&#39;s body, she checked the phone on the ground for a name and number. When she found them, she added them to her own, hoping that Jen would be willing to get to know her a little better. She tried to talk to her, but Jen seemed too exahused to move anything but her hands, which slid slowly up and down over the sides of her boobs.<br />
<br />
As she was leaving the room, she almost felt pity for Jen - Emma was probably the best dick in town, and Jen hadn&#39;t felt it anywhere where it counted. &#39;Another day,&#39; she thought to herself. She took one final look at Jen&#39;s soaking wet body before heading back downstairs to get ready to head to Kelsey&#39;s.</p>
