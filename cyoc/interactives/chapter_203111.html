<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Um...&quot; Mike wasn&#39;t sure what to say next. Not that anyone could blame him. Just a couple of minutes ago he was a normal twelve year old boy on the cusps of puberty, and now he was a very small boy of three, basically a baby. He looked towards his best friend Taylor, also a twelve year old boy. Yet what faced him was anything but. Taylor was now a man, with a boy that most men dreamed of. &quot;Shit! Shit, shit, shit!&quot; Taylor cussed over and over. He was a twelve year old boy and yet his body was nothing of the sort. His heavy junk wiggled uncomfortably in his pants as if to remind him of his newfound adulthood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taylor...&quot; Mike squeaked out. &quot;This fucking sucks! You just had to make that stupid wish!&quot; &quot;Ah... I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry... Sniff!&quot; Mike started to tear up at his friend&#39;s yelling. &quot;God! Ugh!&quot; Taylor paced around a little and took a deep breath. &quot;Sigh... Sorry Mikey. I didn&#39;t mean to yell at you.&quot; &quot;Sniff... Kay....&quot; &quot;This still sucks though. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m a grown up now. And your big brother too.&quot; &quot;Sniff... Yeah... And I&#39;m a little baby now who can&#39;t even go to the bathroom right. What do we do?&quot; &quot;What CAN we do? Without your phone, we&#39;ll never find that app again.&quot; &quot;What about your phone though?&quot; &quot;My phone? Oh, my phone! Goddamn! I almost forgot!&quot; <br />
<br />
Taylor went back to the couch and picked up his phone. It looked the same as it did when he was a twelve year old. Flipping through his contacts, his entire friend&#39;s list had changed.  Looking up his own big brother Adam, he was still in the contacts, but as his best friend now. His parents were nowhere to be found. Of course, Mike&#39;s parents were now his own. Taylor went onto the app store and typed in &quot;Wish Granting App.&quot; The results came up and Taylor sifted through them. Obviously most of these were scams, but the real deal was nowhere to be found. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing...&quot; Taylor said dejected. &quot;Oh no...&quot; Mike said in reply. &quot;Welp... Sigh... Guess we&#39;re doing this then.&quot; &quot;Doing what?&quot; Mike asked as Taylor walked back up to him. &quot;Isn&#39;t it fucking obvious? We have to live like this! There&#39;s no going back. I&#39;m your 21 year old big brother Taylor and you&#39;re my little three year old brother Mikey.&quot; &quot;Ah... But I don&#39;t want this! There has to be something!&quot; &quot;And what would that be?!&quot; &quot;Well... Well... Something!&quot; &quot;God, its like I&#39;m talking to a three year old!&quot; &quot;Cause I am one!&quot; &quot;Well yeah? And I&#39;m the oldest here, so I set the rules.&quot; Taylor walked to Mike and picked him up. &quot;Hey! Let go!&quot; Taylor brought Mike into his room. The room was now fit for someone Mike&#39;s age. Taylor saw a playpen and placed Mike in. &quot;Hey! Don&#39;t leave me here!&quot; &quot;Not listening!&quot; Taylor left to room and slammed the door shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Taylor! Big brother! Let me out! Please!&quot; Taylor simply ignored his younger brothers cries. &quot;Suck it up dude!&quot; was all he said as he went into the bathroom. To his side, he saw the mirror. He tepidly walked towards it. He knew that once he saw his reflection, this would definitely be real. A few moments later, Taylor was up in front of the mirror. And staring back at him was not a twelve year old boy, but a twenty-one year old man. &quot;God.... God fucking dammit!&quot; Taylor slammed the sink in frustration. &quot;This... Sniff... sucks... Sniff!&quot; Taylor started to cry himself. He had missed out on ever being a teenager. Everything that he should have learned through those years was unreachable for him. He was a twelve year old boy stuck in the body of a 21 year old man. &quot;Ugh... Goddammit! His constant cursing was the only thing that made him seem grownup, but even that was learned from his former older brother.<br />
<br />
Taylor lamented his fate for a few minutes. He then rubbed his eyes and gave himself a few invigorating slaps. &quot;Well if I&#39;m gonna be this...&quot; Taylor looked intently at his grown up face. He brought his hands up to it and cradled it. He rubbed his upper lips and felt a few wisps of facial hair. He then opened up his mouth and checked his grown up teeth all nice and white. He looked down at his body. &quot;Jesus...&quot; was all he said. He may have not wanted to be an adult, but he couldn&#39;t deny his body was perfect. He flexed his muscles. &quot;Hngh! Hup!&quot; They bulged out perfectly. Holding out one arm, he flexed again and felt his bicep. &quot;Goddamn, that&#39;s fucking hard!&quot; He then touched his neck next and felt the bulging Adam&#39;s Apple that provided his deep manly voice. Moving down he could feel his pectoral and abdominal muscles through his wife beater shirt. &quot;Fuck it! If I&#39;m gonna do this anyway...&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor grabbed his shirt from the bottom and pulled it up and over his head. Hands raised he dropped the shirt to the ground. He clasped his hands together from behind and flexed again. &quot;Hmgh! Oh yeah!&quot; Letting go, he looked underneath his armpits. Several strands of hair stuck out, he pulled at them slightly and gave them a rub over. He then sniffed at him, the faint man stank permeating into his nostrils. Putting his arms doing completely, he gave his upper body and look over from the mirror. He lightly touched his pectorals and cupped them in his hands. They were hard as a rock and firm. He rubbed over his nipples a bit and plucked them with his fingers. &quot;Ah... Oh... Wow...&quot; Doing so Taylor felt a great pain, but one that didn&#39;t hurt all that bad. If anything, it made his entire body feel good. His penis twitched in his boxers and got slightly harder as a result. &quot;Ah... Holy shit!&quot; Realizing he wouldn&#39;t be able to contain himself any longer, Taylor let go of his nipples. He traced the rest of his body down to his abs. He had an eight pack. Each individual one was a hard as his pecs. He lightly pounded on each one individually. &quot;So fucking hard... Holy shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor looked down more to his legs and feet. Like his arms, his legs were nice and muscular. He turned each leg individually around to see the muscles on the back. Placing his feet back down, he looked at his big meaty feet. He wiggled his toes. &quot;These are really mine, huh?&quot; Taylor placed his toes back down. &quot;Okay... Okay...&quot; Taylor prepared himself for what was to happen next. With some hesitation, he took his hands to his shorts and pulled on them. &quot;Here goes...&quot; He placed his shorts back onto his waist and then took it and his boxers and in one swift movement pulled them own his legs. As he did so, his penis sprung up an waved up and down. Each movement made his dick feel funny as it slowly grew up and out, getting harder and thicker as it did. &quot;Holy... Shit!&quot; Taylor had been too terrified to notice it when he aged up, but his dick was monstrous. It had to be over a foot long and super thick. He could barely hold it completely with one hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...Ah...&quot; As Taylor gripped it, his entire boy shivered. Just touching his penis made it feel so good. He cupped onto his equally large testicles and studied his cock and balls intently. &quot;How do I do this?&quot; Taylor wondered. He had taken peaks at his brother &quot;playing&quot; with his penis. Memories of those moments came flooding back. &quot;What did Adam call it? Jerking off?&quot; Taking what he could remember, Taylor released his balls and grabbed onto his dick with one hand. He then proceeded to move his hand up and down his shaft in short burst. &quot;Ah! Oh! Ohhhh...&quot; Taylor moaned as he started to masturbate for the first time. He was a little sloppy, but it still was enough to fill him with immense pleasure. &quot;Ah! Ah,ah,ah! Oh god!&quot; Taylor continued to move up and down, taking slight breaks to touch the tip an open up his pee hole. &quot;Holy shit! Ah,ah,ah,ah! So fucking good. So... Fucking... Good!&quot; Taylor started to leak pre-cum as he moved up and down his cock faster. Eventually he lost himself to the pleasure and took both hands to do the deed. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah! Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,oh! Come on! Come on!&quot; Taylor felt a surge come from the base of his dick. With several more jerks, his whole body jerked up as the white liquid from before came out of his penis, hitting his chest. &quot;Guh!&quot;  Taylor pushed his penis down a bit. Doing so made even more of the white stuff come shooting out and hitting the mirror. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah!&quot; Taylor panted as he lobbed with hot spunk onto the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Several seconds passed and Taylor felt relief as his penis died down. His dick still dribbled some cum down onto the floor as he let go of his penis. &quot;Hah... hah...hah...&quot; He breathed in and out as the last of the cum came out and with it his dick went down back to its normal (But still huge) size. &quot;Holy... Holy fucking shit! That... That was awesome!&quot; Taylor plopped down on the floor, not caring if he got dirty with his white pee. &quot;Wow... Amazing....&quot; Taylor was still not ready to be the man he appeared to be, but he was definitely not as upset as he was before.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Taylor got up and cleaned the cum as best he could. He was all wet and sticky from what he had done, so he hopped into the shower to get clean, even jerking off one more time. He then finished and dried off, wrapping a towel around his waist. &quot;Now then. Let&#39;s see how my dumb little baby brother is doing,&quot; Taylor said with a smirk. He went down stairs with the towel still on and opened the room. &quot;Hey Mikey! How you hanging?!&quot; &quot;Leave me alone!&quot; Mike yelled out. &quot;Aw, what&#39;s the matter? Baby scared of me?&quot; &quot;I said leave me alone!&quot; &quot;Now that&#39;s no way to talk to your big bro.&quot; Taylor moved up to Mike and then realized why he didn&#39;t want Taylor near him. The scent of fresh poop wafted in the air. &quot;Aw, I see. Little baby made a messy-wessy in his diapy-wipey?&quot; &quot;Screw you!&quot; &quot;Hey, don&#39;t talk to me like that little boy!&quot; Taylor lightly, yet firmly smack Mike in the face. &quot;Ow! You hurt me!&quot; &quot;Yeah? Well that&#39;s what big brothers do sometimes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Taylor went to a drawer and rummaged around. &quot;Here they are!&quot; &quot;What are you?&quot; Mike started to ask, but he soon saw what was in his hand. A fresh change of diapers and some wipes. &quot;Oh no you don&#39;t!&quot; Mike shouted as he tried to get away. &quot;Well you don&#39;t get to decide that!&quot; Taylor quipped back as he got into the play pen and held Mike down. &quot;No! No! Let me go!&quot; Mike tried to fight it, but Taylor was simply to strong for him. His kicks and punches were but minor inconveniences for the hard body of a 21 year old man. With ease Taylor removed Mike&#39;s shirt and shorts, leaving him in his diapers, the yellow and brown stains showing that he had both peed and pooped while Taylor was gone. &quot;Now then, lets change you up now.&quot; With little effort, Taylor then removed Mike&#39;s diaper, leaving him completely naked. Taylor took the wipes and cleaned Mike&#39;s body, touching his tiny penis as he did so. &quot;Ah... Ahh!&quot; Mike squirmed as his best friend, now big brother, played with his baby wiener. &quot;It&#39;s so fucking tiny, man!&quot; &quot;Ah... Stop!&quot; Mike felt humiliated as Taylor toyed with him. Finishing his wiping off, Taylor removed his towel, leaving him naked as well. His big penis swung over Mike&#39;s body. &quot;See. Look how different it is,&quot; Taylor said as he hit Mike&#39;s little penis with his own. &quot;Ah! Ah! Stop! No more!&quot; &quot;Sorry about that dude! But I&#39;m the big brother and I can do whatever I want!&quot; Taylor smirked as he toyed with his friend, now little brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean... That IS what you wished for? Right?&quot;</p>
