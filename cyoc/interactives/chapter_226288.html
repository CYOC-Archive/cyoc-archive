<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The anthro tigress fury sat down in her hospital lab after finishing her congratulatory visit with Brittany Soulfang-Proudhoof’s successful birth of her two cubs. Fraternal twins; a male charcoal grey wolf cub and a female doe cub; Dusk and Dawn respectively. Her mate Michael Proudhoof was with her as he sat on the nearby sofa. He was supposed to head back to the restaurant but decided that the place could wait a few more hours without him.<br />
“I’m a grandfather,” Michael looking at an old photo. It was when he was human and was in the same hospital holding one of his sons while his now deceased wife Victoria held the other. He remembers Victoria’s labor lasted nearly the whole day and there was discussion of birth by caesarian. In the end, she gave birth and he had two healthy boys. Both boys are now adults and as him, anthro stag-deer furies. <br />
<br />
“Perhaps you can be a father again,” Denise checking her emails on her work computer. Originally posted at this town to keep an eye out for any potential outbreaks of Covid or other diseases that can propagate and infect the for-profit care homes in the area. This was now moot as those care homes are now vacant. All the residences passed away when the fury flu ran rampant and sadly killed them as their weakened bodies could not handle the stresses of being changed right down to the genetic level. Now she technically was still an employee of the CDC, however the organization was in transition now that the Fury flu was effectively converted nearly every human on Earth. A few hold outs remain in the United States and several remnants of totalitarian governments are still trying to cling onto their vanishing power.<br />
<br />
“But you are taking heat suppression pills,” Michael putting his old photo away; “you said you weren’t ready to have cubs just yet.”<br />
“I did say that. Oh this is odd,” Denise looking at an odd email that came while she was on the maternity floor. “I just got an email from the president asking for a meeting. It has a link for a video conference.”<br />
“President,” Michael getting up from the sofa and walking towards Denise’s desk; “of the hospital?”<br />
“President of the United States,” Denise looking perplexed; I wonder what she wants?”<br />
“Click the link and find out,” Michael finding this situation interesting.<br />
<br />
***********<br />
<br />
The female anthro otter fury smiled as her computer chimed over an incoming video conference. Sitting in the oval office of the white house she accepts the call and is instantly greeted over the screen by an anthro tigress fury and a anthro buck-deer fury.<br />
“Hello,” the president speaking; “is this Dr. Denise Williams?<br />
“Dr. Denise Proudhoof,”the anthro tigress correcting the otter fur on video conference; “I shed my old human name when I became a fury and landed a mate.”<br />
“Understandable,” The otter fury nodding; “I take it that is your mate with you?”<br />
“Michael Proudhoof,” the male fury answering; “And if we can, let’s cut through the banter and get to the reason for this chat.”<br />
“Wow,” the madam president giving a surprised expression; “a direct approach. I guess that is fair.”<br />
<br />
“I’m contacting you Doctor as you are the only member of the CDC from my predecessor’s administration that didn’t get axed, quit, or pass away thanks to the events of last Thanksgiving.”<br />
Denise and Michael listen as the president continues her soliloquy; both knew that Denise was the cause of the mass epidemic as she managed to engineer the fury virus to be airborne. Allowing a massive amount of humans to become infected at once and then the virus’s primary mode of infection of fluid transfer, be it sexual in nature or other methods. If the president knew of this fact, she so far hasn’t let on.<br />
“Dr. Denise,” the president getting to the point; “I would like to extend to you an invitation to become the new director of the CDC.”<br />
“That is a big ask,” Denise looking stunned; “Wasn’t director Crawley in charge?” Denise not knowing the new name the director took after becoming a Chinese green Tree Pit Viper Fury.<br />
Not many know this,” The president’s rounded ears flattening towards her fury brown head; “but he attacked the president and infected him and several secret service agents here in Washington. Both he and his assistant were killed.”<br />
“Oh no,” Denise looking shocked; “Adam is dead as well?”<br />
“Yes. Bear in mind that this happened at the start of the pandemic and the whole country was in a state of panic. A cover story needed to be established quickly so as not to plunge people further into anarchy,” the otter fury droning on her end of the call.<br />
“So passing away during your Thanksgiving address was just a cover story,” Denise remembering the emergency broadcast.<br />
“It wasn’t an outright lie,” the president shrugging her shoulders; “it was merely a story that omitted certain key facts.”<br />
“Like the Warren commission in regards to the Kennedy assassination,” Michael Proudhoof chiming in.<br />
“No,” The president waving off the comment; not having the patience to entertain a possible fringe theory regarding a grassy knoll or a second shooter working in tandem with Lee Harvey Oswald. “Taking the position would require you to relocate to Georgia,” the president speaking.<br />
<br />
“It’s a nice offer,” Denise pausing; raising a hand paw to stop Michael from speaking. “But we just had a birth in the family,” Denise speaking; “one of my mate’s sons just became a father to fraternal twins.”<br />
“Oh congratulations,” the president smiling; “was it a difficult birth?”<br />
“On the contrary,” Denise answering; “the two wanted out and the labor lasted thirty to forty five minutes tops. Michael and I only arrive just in time to witness the birth of the second cub. The ambulance soon arrived a few minutes later to take here.” <br />
“I’m also expecting the birth of another grand cub in a few months,” Michael adding; “my other son and his mate are well on their way to adding to the family.”<br />
“I don’t think I can just relocate to Atlanta Georgia to head up an organization that may now seem redundant,” Denise looking apologetic; “but family should come first at the moment.”<br />
“I understand,” the president nodding; “but congress will want you to answer some questions.” The president flashing a sinister smile before continuing; “questions regarding how you engineered the fury flu outbreak. Questions that could be quashed if you took the position.”<br />
<br />
“The only way I could accept the job,” Denise trying to gauge the president over a computer monitor; “is if the CDC headquarters is relocated here. I don’t want to leave my new family behind, let alone separate my mate from his son’s and grand cubs.”<br />
“Well that is an interesting bargaining position,” the president shuffling a pile of unseen paper; “most would want to know what is being held over their head. But you seem to know already what I am referring to.”<br />
Denise remained silent; she knew that the method of dispersing the virus in the Jetstream using weather balloons might come back on her. It was why she only ever told Adam before he infected director Crawley.<br />
“I take it Adam kept some records,” Denise breaking the silence; “and you were able to piece them together…”<br />
“Thanks to a couple of weather balloons that were recovered,” the president grinning; “fortunately the French government doesn’t know what we know. I would also imagine that if this news got out, several remaining pockets of humanity would be out for your blood.”<br />
“Any human that tries to hunt me,” Denise growling in anger; “will soon find themselves being hunted right back.”<br />
“And they would have to get through me first,” Michael looking stern.<br />
“I believe you,” the president nodding; “which is why we are having this talk in private and not in front of politicians who despite their new liberal outlook by becoming a fury; still have some conservative values and are strong adherents to the rule of law. More so when it comes to terrorist acts, regardless as to who is committing them.”<br />
“Then relocate the headquarters of the CDC to here,” Denise making her one demand clear. “It could be Portland Oregon, Tacoma or Seattle Washington. Either three cities are driving distance from the town I reside in. And before you get into the logistical nightmare of an agency on the other side of the country; I would like to remind you that several foreign consulates and embassies dot the west coast. So calling those diplomats to receive a dressing down or demanding an explanation regarding some jackass stunt is not something out of the ordinary.”<br />
“Okay,” the president nodding; “I guess we can work with that. You will still need to travel to Washington from time to time. And you would need to be in New York to consult with the World Health Organization. Expect a call from me later,” the president signing off the video conference.<br />
<br />
“Fuck,” Denise shaking her head; “just when I think I’m free of them…”<br />
“They pull you back in,” Michael finishing and paraphrasing the famous movie quote.<br />
“I guess Adam either misplaced my letter of resignation, or he purposely had it destroyed,” Denise sighing; “either way, I’m still a virologist for the CDC. Now the next director.”<br />
“We have a madam president who use to be the vice president,” Michael giving his mate a hug; “no reason why an organization as important as the CDC can’t have a woman in charge.”<br />
<br />
The anthro trigress fury rumbled in approval as her mate’s hug soon turned into a shoulder massage. His hoof hands digging deep into her shoulders as he works to undo whatever kinks and knots are in her muscles. Slowly working his way down her back as he leans in to provide kisses to the back of her fury neck.<br />
“Take me to the sofa,” Denise exhales deeply as she slowly gets up from her chair; feeling his shaft poking her as her tail thrashes about.<br />
“Muzzle to muzzle,” Michael asking, wrapping his arms around Denise as the two half walk half stumble to the blue-green fake leather piece of furniture. <br />
“Yes,” Denise turns around; her feline nose pressing against Michael’s nose as he guides her down to the sofa, spreading her legs and exposing her already moist entrance. Guiding his shaft into her entrance, both moan as they feel each other rubbing their fury bodies. Kissing each other as Michael starts to thrust into Denise; feeling her breath blow past his cervine ear, causing it to twitch as he picked up speed. The sofa beginning to creak as it was not designed to handle the stresses the two furies were putting it through.<br />
<br />
Michael starts nibbling on of Denise’s ears as she dug her claws into Michael’s rear end; her moaning as she feels his tapered shaft poking through her cervix was confirmation for Michael to pick up the pace. Determined to finish, he presses his body closer to hers as he feels her legs wrap around him while her claws move up his back.<br />
“Almost there,” Michael grunting; his hot breath blowing in Denise’s ear as she moaned; the pleasure from her over stimulated sex had her at a loss for words as she was already clamping down on his shaft. Her vaginal muscle milking him as she feels the shaft twitch and spasm as he grunts. Making a few forceful thrusts he then then moans as he climaxes; feeling his seed pump through and filling her up.<br />
“Oh what a way to end an eventful day,” Denise sighing as her mate climbs off of her; sitting on the sofa next to her.<br />
“It’s only five in the afternoon,” Michael looking at the clock on the wall; “I still have a restaurant to run.”<br />
“Well I’m just mentally done,” Denise yawning as she sits up and leans into Michael; “do you need to go back to work?”<br />
“Jake is with Brittany as the two coo over their new born cubs,” Michael answering; “Jimmy is most likely home with Allison. I need to be there to help expedite service. Why don’t you join me,” Michael getting up but then seeing her passed out. “Or I’ll just take you home so you can sleep in a comfortable bed.”</p>
