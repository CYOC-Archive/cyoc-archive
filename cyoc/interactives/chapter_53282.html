<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Judas didn't know how to read, he has Father Mike read the black cat the Scripture. <br />
However, Judas could still watch TV as well as anything with ears and eyeballs. Judas <br />
noticed the changes in people and place happening across Glendale in the local news no <br />
one seemed to notice seemingly but him. This didn't feel like the curse placed on the town <br />
by the masters of his ancestor Herodias, more like, like the damage from the curse being <br />
healed over somehow, or at least scabbed over. &quot;Finally the shame of my line ends.&quot; Judas <br />
meowed to himself. &quot;I hope big and little brother both take it well.&quot;<br />

<br />
Omega Abdul was the least shiva of the Shiva-wolves, possessing only a extra tail and a <br />
extra wolf-hood, but he knew precisely how to please Martha, and the brothers Maddex <br />
and Ryan were quick to follow his lead.  <br />
<br />
No extra heads, no extra arms, no third eye, no second set of nipples, Abdul was almost <br />
plain when compared to the other omegas; much like Martha was the only omega whose <br />
fur was a solid color rather than also possessing a highlight, but the shiva wolves had <br />
discarded such prejudices generations ago. Indeed, Abdul would have been considered the <br />
lowest of the low, while Joy and Ingrid would have been at the top of the pecking order <br />
together.  But Omega Martha was the best at what she did, and thus why she was 'prime <br />
omega' (a joke title when it was originally introduced but had evolved into it's own) chief <br />
maid, and why the other shiva wolves referred to her first, but all of them still referred to <br />
ultimate Alpha Jensen. <br />
<br />
'Master Jensen,' Omega Martha thought, 'I doubt the pack has had ever so radical an <br />
Alpha... ' Master Jensen, or Alpha Jensen or simply Jensen as he preferred, had not only <br />
appointed three females to the point of Beta, but had encouraged the pack members to <br />
discard the pecking order that had led to so much (often violent) in-fighting over the <br />
generations.  The last lupman to do that had been a man named John who had been <br />
formally record as Nil John  in the pack family archive. <br />
<br />
&quot;I missed you so,&quot; Omega Martha's heads whispered, one to Ryan, one to Maddex, her <br />
forehead eyes looking right at Abdul. <br />
<br />
&quot;As did we dear,&quot; Said Omega Maddex's heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;As did we.&quot; Repeated Omega Ryan's heads.  Ryan and Maddex's extras were much like <br />
Martha, the only difference being the obvious difference between men and women and <br />
were doubled like Martha's were.  Martha -almost- wished she had an middle head like Joy <br />
and Ingrid, but she felt such a thing would have ruined her symmetry, the two sides of her <br />
body were truly beautiful reflections of each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;As did we all,&quot; Abdul finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgive you for lying to me.&quot; Martha's head said. <br />
<br />
The males started, then Abdul said, &quot;We couldn't feel loss being the pup's shadows, we <br />
couldn't feel regret, we only felt sadness at the incompletion of a task, the will of the pups <br />
was everything as we acted as their voice and hands in the world of adults... technically <br />
speaking the assets we accumulated as their mouth pieces belong to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure they'll serve the pack well.&quot; The pack had a community sense of ownership, that <br />
omegas couldn't own or control pack property had been done away with a few generations <br />
back. <br />
<br />
&quot;We know they will.&quot; Five male voice said in reply.<br />
<br />
Omega Martha leaned back in her pillow bed chair, closing her eyes as she felt the males <br />
fall over her. She didn't want to think what her life would be without them, and was just <br />
glade she didn't have to walk the dutiful and necessary path of Omega alone. <br />
<br />
Martha felt five muzzles nuzzling her two and with her lower arms embraced the silver <br />
with blue highlights shiva brothers feeling the small of their backs while her upper arms <br />
reached out and embraced the blue with gold highlights shiva male in front of her and <br />
pulled him in. She felt two at once enter her body and pulled them in deeper. She felt <br />
Abdul's paws rubbing her upper breasts while the brothers  rubbed her lower breasts with <br />
their upper arms rubbed her back. <br />
<br />
Martha put her legs around Abdul's rear and locked him in place as the males strokes her <br />
ears and the base of her tails and her belly button. To the outside observer it was a mess <br />
of arms and wolf heads... to the participants, it was Heaven. <br />
<br />
Moaning echoed through out the wing (there was a reason the pup's room was the only <br />
sound proof room in the mansion). <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
After shaking themselves relatively dry (then shaking themselves again this time far <br />
enough away not to splatter each other) Toni and Mbili had gone into the household and <br />
found a chalk board in the surprisingly well organized basement and came back to write <br />
down a score board for the proceeding water war. <br />
<br />
~<br />
Water War Current Losses: <br />
<br />
Gem Twins:<br />
Toni<br />
Jay <br />
<br />
Pride Quadruplets: <br />
Mbili<br />
~<br />
<br />
&quot;Should you include Mr. P?&quot; Jay asked Toni as she finishing writing up the losses for their <br />
side.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was more an innocent bystander than a combatant.&quot; Mbili said before Toni could <br />
comply.<br />
<br />
Toni nodded a this. <br />
<br />
The mighty beast sitting next to the door as in plain view of the 'battle field' said in a gruff <br />
voice dripping dry, &quot;If I was actually taking part in all this you kids would be look like <br />
drowned rats.&quot; Underneath him, the glass pups' pet Chester squirmed where Mr. P held <br />
him fast. <br />
<br />
&quot;How pleasant.&quot; Mbili said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's only joking, Mr. P is like that.&quot; Toni defended. <br />
<br />
Mbili asked, &quot;Why do you call him Mister anyway? I thought you lupmen don't have Misters <br />
and Misses'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm right here cub.&quot; Mr. P said calmly even laying down he was huge compared to the <br />
young lion cub. &quot;If you must know... I guess I'm so old now that I kinda fall out of the <br />
typical pack order... I was old when yer grandpa was in diapers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mbili giggled at that image. But since it wasn't direct interaction, her grandfather (in <br />
particular Elise's father) remained human a hundred miles away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Besides youngster, Snowwhite ain't your mother, and you call her Mother Glen don't ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's Mother Glen to you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry kiddo, she likes it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Pence his gun empty tackled and pushed Tatuli on her tail as he leapt toward the fountain <br />
to refill, however a large sparkle purple paw lifted him up a moment too soon. <br />
<br />
&quot;No rough housing, remember the rules.&quot; Said the pack's largest busted she-wolf next to <br />
the parody size japanese she-wolves. <br />
<br />
Pence not having Moja's focus for manipulating the rules, and having a deep respect for his <br />
elder said, &quot;Yes Psi Amethyst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Miss Amethyst Pence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's your name isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amethyst having helped the cubs, but not being technically an Omega had rewarded her <br />
with the letter Psi as her name prefix, the second to last letter in the greek alphabet. <br />
Similar to Ulysses' and Sarah's prefixes.   &quot;Yes, but I'd like it if you called me Miss <br />
Amethyst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought Miss was for Leomen and humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I like it too.&quot; She put him down and smiled, her chest weights swinging as she leaned <br />
down to look at him, &quot;And we can continue talking about this if you want, but you'll gonna <br />
get soaked if you do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Pence turned to see Tatuli and Nneli both charges at him looking to return the favor. Pence <br />
ran for the fountain like there was no tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Wanting to take himself out rather than give Tauli and Nneli the satisfaction (Yamato would <br />
have been proud), he leapt right at the fountain. <br />
<br />
The lion cubs sisters Tatuli and Nneli charge, then skidded to a halt, looked at the <br />
fountain, then around, then at each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Er, who were we chasing again?&quot; Nneli asked her fellow art girl. <br />
<br />
Tatuli took a moment to appreciate the fountain though she had seen it a thousand times <br />
before (she always loved stone the way Nneli loved glass) seeing the three adult wolves <br />
back to back spitting and the marble male lupman pup in the middle grinning with his <br />
arms behind it's back.  <br />
<br />
&quot;... I forget.&quot; Tatuli admitted. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jay was moaning if he had a twin like the rest he wouldn't have been blasted so <br />
easily, everyone ignored him.<br />
<br />
Tatuli and Nneli turned their backs on the fountain, and were instantly squirted.  They <br />
instantly turned back seeing the jasper fur colored Pence grinning at him among the legs <br />
of the three statues. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HOW DID WE MISS HIM?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Pence just giggled and managed to leap the entire distance of the fountain's basin and onto <br />
the edge gracefully and land on the other side forcing the girls to go around after him.<br />
<br />
Pence wasn't sure what just happened, but he looked back at the statue who he swore were <br />
looking at him and whispered, &quot;Thank you.&quot;  Jay cheered his brother still in the game on. <br />
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile hearing Amethyst referred to as Psi had perked Mbili's natural cat curiosity and <br />
she asked Toni, &quot;So how do the prefixes in your family work again? What's yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we're pups, so we don't have any until we turn eighteen or gain one honorary before <br />
that, Uly' has one honorary.  Martha and the other shiva wolves are the omegas. <br />
<br />
Alphas Jesen and Alpha Kaylee are Alphas, Betas Julie, Darla, and Fran are our Betas.  <br />
<br />
Gamma-Zack is Gamma, Gamma-Pearl, Delta-June, Delta-Hope, Delta-Grace.  <br />
<br />
Nick and Nicole and their mates are Epsilons and Zetas. Lawrence and his mates are Etas <br />
and Thetas. Roger and his mates are Iota and Kappa. Yomato, and the Hokkaido she wolves <br />
are Lambda and Mu. And Robert and his mates are Nu and Xi. <br />
<br />
 Miss Amethyst would technically be Kappa-Amethyst, but she works with Miss Martha so <br />
much to carter to our every whim- I mean look after us that why she's called Psi-Amethyst <br />
instead.If the pack is -really- big live in the same place, then every sub-pack is given the <br />
same letter.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mnili's head spun in a tail spin and made an emergency landing almost resulting in the <br />
loss of passengers and crew, &quot;Wow, sounds really -really- complicated, what about pack <br />
members who don't live here or aren't married?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is really complicated, that why I think Alpha Jensen told all the adults to just get ride of <br />
it! Lot more trouble than it's worth. He says we should just be the Big bad Wolf Pack: not <br />
divided up into ranks and tiers.  Miss Amethyst says we need to learn -about- it just cause <br />
it's part of our heritage. She says we're gonna be the first lupmens in like, forever, not to <br />
be given a rank letter when we grow up, and Uly' is gonna be the last to be given a letter. <br />
Those aren't married are given a stand alone letter or grouped together depending how big <br />
the pack is. Luna and Sunny are both Chi-, Trinity and Kimberly are Phi-, and Sarah and <br />
Uly' are both Upsilon ... yeah, it really makes my head hurt too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should be glade your Alpha is getting ride of it, keeping all those relatives in <br />
your head must be really really really really hard, memorizing a bunch of letters would be <br />
even harder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup!&quot; Toni nodded glade she could explain things and agreeing with Mbili's statement <br />
they wouldn't have to learn a bunch of new letter once they grew up. Life was complicated <br />
and confusing and contrived ENOUGH. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
For Penny it was rather disturbing, as the icing on the cake, to see her mother become <br />
'bald' as Kirk's mother had apparently from the transformation from human to leoman. It <br />
also dawned on Penny just how much lionesses looked similar in comparison to the men... <br />
deep down she felt rather insulted by that. She wondered if that had to do with biology, or <br />
Brian and Felicity only knowing about lions via the Lion King (not knowing they had actually <br />
done a small amount of research before they had transformed to save their family and <br />
Madam Serenity's crew from Nicole kidnapping squad). <br />
<br />
The look on her mother and grand mother's faces was a duel assault was something she <br />
had never been able to defend against as Pen, and couldn't defend against now. But what <br />
could she say? What did she -dare- say? She looked at Kirk who looked as helpless as she <br />
did... Penny actually wheeled back some in her wheelchair. If her legs were working at least <br />
she could make a lame brain excuse and run for it. Now that wasn't an option. <br />
<br />
&quot;It... involved restoring Kirk, and the other pack member who were turned into statues and <br />
sold off: Arael, Armisael, Mal'akh, and Gabriel, but I got into a fight with a band of art <br />
thieves who wanted them and a bunch of other victims. I can't say anymore until the paper <br />
work for the report is written up. And I'm told nearly all the pack is really banged up from <br />
the mission so that could be a while.&quot; <br />
<br />
'I think, I loved riding on her back before... wait, what? NO! DAMMIT!' Penny thought with <br />
shock and horror, 'No! I don't want to forget being Pen! I don't want to forget my grandma <br />
being human! Dammit! This isn't fair!' Penny thought with anger and sadness at their <br />
realization.  <br />
<br />
She also felt a alien memory of a lion cub who looked a lot like Fox, 'Heh, a lioness named <br />
'fox', never gets old,'  speaking to her about sensing something new about her, the magic <br />
that saturated Glendale for three hundred years apparently granting Penny a power as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please God,' Penny thought, 'I don't want to forget. I don't want to forget being me... <br />
please...' <br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong sweetie?&quot; Mother Glen asked seeing her grandchild in dire straights, like <br />
Patrick, Mr. P, she was old while others who were old were young, but she loved every <br />
member of her family not the same, but each in their unique way. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's... it's nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't try to lie to -me- child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's... personal, I promise I'll tell you after I'm out of the chair.&quot; 'If I'm even still me at that <br />
point.'<br />
<br />
[i] 'If I'm even still me at that point.'  [/i] <br />
<br />
Amy mentally read back what she had finish writing down as she leaned back letting <br />
Whitney gave her a talking to about being reckless and going on the roof by herself, Amy <br />
didn't consider herself in any danger while on the roof, but knew better than to say that to <br />
her care taker. <br />
<br />
As the bucks of the Herd were brought out in pairs of two to the Pack's estate by Alice and <br />
Abbey, (not giving as violent a reaction as Jack-sama and Tom-san), Amy and Zel-kun <br />
were led to the front yard, least they get the bucks agitated as Nane-chan had apparently <br />
accidently or something or other. <br />
<br />
Whitney-san found the entire front yard in perky bedlam. The relatively organized lion <br />
cubs against the directed chaos of the gem twins and apparently the added firepower now <br />
of Mary-chan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear, stand back Master Zelipe, Mistress Amy.&quot; Omega Whitney said her four arms <br />
pushing the pups back from the mess of little naked wet fur.  <br />
<br />
Amy looked at her -very- precious scroll, and had no intention of it getting it wet (or <br />
letting Whitney know Amy had been writing in Amy's own blood). <br />
<br />
Amy counted how many pups there were, and how many cubs there were. It seemed the <br />
pups were numerically at a disadvantage. <br />
<br />
Amy thought, 'Hmm, that's no fair.' <br />
<br />
Amy looked at her brother, who was looking at this with awe. 'He's such a mama's boy, <br />
nothing wrong with that at all, but he needs some more friends.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Zel-Kun.&quot; She said looking at her half-brother. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Amy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you join?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What-?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn't be fair if both of us joined, but right now our pack mates are at a <br />
disadvantage, and that's not fair either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Life not fair! Nya nya!&quot; Nane called out her round ears not just for show. <br />
<br />
Amy nodded, &quot;True enough,&quot; She looked at her brother, &quot;But that doesn't mean WE don't <br />
have to be fair Zel-kun...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm unarmed...&quot; <br />
<br />
Amethyst having seen Whitney arrive with Zackery's pups in two shouted, &quot;Not anymore <br />
you're not!&quot; <br />
<br />
Amethyst produced another squirt gun from who knows where and marched over and <br />
knelt and handed the gun to the pale pink lupman boy. <br />
<br />
&quot;There ya go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HE'S A VIABLE TARGET! GET'EM!&quot;  Sita declared as she and Nane began a two pronged <br />
assault. <br />
<br />
Zulema grimaced as the new-comer dove behind the gem twins for protection. &quot;Just what <br />
we need, another boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the army draftee.&quot; Pence smiled holding a hand out to Zelipe glade to have <br />
another Y chromosome on the team. <br />
<br />
Zelipe look it as the spot he had been a moment before was hit by several water squirts. <br />
<br />
Amy smiled, knowing this was what her brother needed. She wondered if she or glass <br />
Marie would have a chance to comfort Penny by the time things were over. <br />
<br />
She and Whitney stood back on the front porch with Frontdoor still at the island the view <br />
was not obstructed except the fountain's statues. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey let their sister Samantha to her rest, they could handle the bucks without <br />
her, just made things a slower going. Finally, the many bucks of the herd were back where <br />
they belonged on the estate. The majority of the personal who had been meant to help with <br />
the experiment had been members of the family or close friends, so she trusted to keep <br />
Alice and Abbey's quick relocation to and from Big Bad Island from spreading too far. <br />
<br />
Jack, Tom, Harry, Roland, Adam and the other bucks were back among their native home. <br />
<br />
'Now is the time to reunite the Gold Deer with their beloved does and fawns.' She looked at <br />
Adam, 'Those bucks who can be reunited with those care for at the very least.' Alice <br />
wondered if it would be kinder to take down Adam next tim the pack hunted so he could <br />
be reunited with Eve in death. <br />
<br />
Jack actually admitted to himself he actually -liked- the body paint... if only they had <br />
fingers to do it themselves... though that might made their duty a little -too- awkward. <br />
<br />
The smaller glass pup Abbey looked at Alice, &quot;Sister, The two sets of quadruplets of the <br />
pride told us after we arrived with Mr. Jack and Mr. Tom that they could help by teleporting <br />
the does back to the estate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are correct sister.&quot; Alice wondered how to tell Abbey that was also were the cubs <br />
mothers had just died, Alice knew more than children her age had a right to, she actually <br />
envied Samantha and Abbey like that, well, at least Abbey now, Samantha had been <br />
drenched in the sea of infinite chaos, that would leave scars inside her forever. Alice was <br />
very very very glade that the wicked witches were gone forever. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shall we ask for their aid sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The majority of them were and appear to be engaged in a mock-battle with squirt guns. It <br />
would be improper to interrupt their game sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did imply sister that we would accept their help once all the bucks were back on the <br />
estate sister. Would it not be -more- improper to now ignore their offer for help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Perhaps you are right sister. But let us bring along a white flag so they might know we <br />
seek not to engage in their war.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A white flag sister? Where shall we find a white flag to use to show we mean not to add to <br />
their war?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you follow me sister I shall show you and we may acquire what we need to create one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well sister.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two half-siblings marched off Alice taking the lead. <br />
<br />
Sunny and Luna lamented on their inability to win Alpha Jensen's heart, and how unfair it <br />
was that Martha got to keep three perfectly fine lupmen all to herself as they cut up the <br />
meat to bite size for their grievously injured pack mates and allies. <br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey made no sound as they moved just as they had no scent in the world <br />
outside the mirror, and Luna and Sunny did not look behind themselves. They would <br />
wonder where the white cloth had gone when they eventually did, along with the spare <br />
soup spoon. They would eventually conclude they must have misplaced it and went back to <br />
their responsibility to their packmates and allies. <br />
<br />
Alice and Abbey behind her emerged from the kitchen's outer door, and waved the white <br />
flag they had created. This got the attention of everyone. <br />
<br />
&quot;TRUCE! PARLAY! CEASE-FIRE!&quot; Abbey called out as they marched right into the battle field, <br />
their ears getting soaked in the process, of course, it all rolled off them like rain on a <br />
polished window. <br />
<br />
Finally after a minute the wolves and lions settled down. <br />
<br />
&quot;We now have all the bucks back at our Wolf Manor's estate. Would you like to aid I and <br />
Abbey bring the does back to the estate?&quot;  Alice said the nearest cub, who happened to be <br />
Tano. <br />
<br />
&quot;We promised we would didn't we?&quot; Tano said. <br />
<br />
&quot;No you did not promise,&quot; Alice said, &quot;You asked if you we needed help. And to let you <br />
know if we -NEED- help. We do not NEED your help because we can still accomplish our <br />
task anyway. But it would take much more time to accomplish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let us help you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If that's what you want.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't -exactly- promise, but there's more to words than their precise meaning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A word's precise meaning is everything.&quot; Alice replied instantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;All the same,&quot; Tano looked at her sisters and cub-mates, &quot;Everyone wanna help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eight paws raised up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Mary, I do not think you can really help here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary started, having been caught up in things, and merely nodded and took a step back. <br />
<br />
Nane gave Gretchen a hug then rushed to the glass pups. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on.&quot; Nane said taking Alice and Abbey's hands, &quot;Let's show you how we do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember where the island is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like it was the place I was born.&quot; Nane said strangely and did three steps and she and the <br />
glass cubs were gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey don't leave us behind little sister!&quot; Sita said and telported away. <br />
<br />
Saba looked at Paula and hugged her, &quot;Be back soon promise.&quot; Paula nodded and Saba took <br />
three steps. <br />
<br />
The rest of the quadruplets followed suit. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't have minded going back.&quot; Zulema said wondering how different the island <br />
looked now. <br />
<br />
Amethyst looked at the gem twins and Zelipe. &quot;I guess the battle is on hold until they get <br />
back! Who wants some target practice on the statues?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we can all wrestle after all.&quot; Paula said.<br />
<br />
Toni sighed. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;HAIL! HAIL! The gang's all hear!&quot; Nane declared Alice and Abbey holding her hands still as <br />
she stepped into existence among the teenage wolves. <br />
<br />
Garnet (who had the agitation of her name often wrongly written down even by her <br />
packmates as Gargent) yelped and the teenage wolf held a hand to her chest, &quot;Don't do <br />
that! I almost had a heart attack.&quot; <br />
<br />
Abbey and Alice mimed a curtsey and apologized while Nane giggled, &quot;Hehe, sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be glade you didn't scare the does and fawns.&quot; Emerald said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no harm no foul.&quot; Nane defended to the teenage wolf. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Ruby had to ask. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just here to help.&quot; Nane smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your kind of help?&quot; Emerald raised an eyebrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Their kind of help.&quot; Alice said simply. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;For the record,&quot; Lawrence said remembering his years of study before his feeling of <br />
inferiority to Epsilon Nick and Alpha Jensen had driven him to bulk up and neglect his <br />
studies his parents had been so proud of him for. &quot;The Nazis targeted not just Jews, but <br />
also Gypsies, Catholics, Russians, Homosexuals, and the mentally retarded. Hilter simply <br />
targeted the Jewish people in earnest because he had petty, small, personal reasons for <br />
hating them.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lilly and Casandra looked at each other, most of those words going over their heads. For <br />
the record, both of them were dressed like proper young ladies of the Victorian era in <br />
matching red/purple dresses with matching hats. While Lawrence was dressed as a <br />
victorian gentleman and his aunt Betty an odd white dress with a lot of ruffles. <br />
<br />
Glass Marie nodded, &quot;It was just an example. And not really the point. The sisters were now <br />
the single most emotional unstable thing in creation, children who had suffered loss. And <br />
like any child were ready to lash out at what had hurt them. Joseph knew this very well. And <br />
did his absolute best to make sure the girls didn't forget their grandmother's dying wish or <br />
his own promise to her.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Revenge -won't- make you feel better little Gita,&quot; Joseph warned Gita as she did drawing <br />
of a being eaten alive by a big snake for the third time that week, &quot;It won't at all. Revenge <br />
will only leave you with an even more empty feeling than you have now... I know people <br />
who have given into revenge... it never made them happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
'It would make me happy.' Gita said ignoring what her guardian said using but barely <br />
enjoying the gifts given to her. <br />
<br />
Mrs. Marcine Wise had paid for Balthilde's funeral, for her years of loyal service, and as an <br />
act of kindness for the girls now in the hands of that 'wicked man' which she was sure had <br />
something to do with her sons Jack and the others vanishing and being forgotten by <br />
everyone but her.  Most figured she was trying to fill the void she felt from not having <br />
children of her own, she swore on a bible she had had several sons but they had vanished... <br />
everyone thought she was harmlessly mad. <br />
<br />
She tried to argue that she'd be in a better position to take care of the girls, but each time <br />
she seemed to be making headway, the person she spoke to got a glassy look in their eyes <br />
and dismissed her with few words. <br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma said be good... grandma said be good... Mr. Running-Bear said we should honor <br />
what Grandma said... &quot; The child to be known one day as Golgatha said stroking 'Princess' <br />
whose true name unknown to the girls until she became their familiar was Herodias.  The <br />
girl's voice was like ice.  &quot;That's what Grandma said... it's the last thing grandma said... <br />
helping those other kids from becoming bad adults was a good thing right Princess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Goldwyn, it was.&quot; 'Princess' said soothingly, calmly, encouragingly. With the old <br />
woman gone, Herodias now now focused mostly on deflecting her presence being sensed <br />
by the native who had the same second sight as the old woman. She could let nothing <br />
interfere with her mistress Goldwyn's glorious destiny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Running-Bear says revenge is wrong... Grandma said to listen to him didn't she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That she did.&quot; 'Princess' answered. <br />
<br />
Goldwyn looked at her sister, then at her other sister looking blandly out the window as <br />
light snow fell. <br />
<br />
The black cat Herodias warped her own in the cloak that made her unnoticed but not <br />
invisible. <br />
<br />
Goldwyn took her coat (another gift from Mrs. Wise), and walked out of Running-Bear's <br />
house behind his back.  No one stopped to ask what a child was doing out in the final days <br />
of winter. They barely even saw her. Holding onto 'Princess' the entire time. <br />
<br />
She walked into the jail unopposed not even the constable from before noticed her. The <br />
cell a lice infested joke that resembled a mattress with a chamber pot for a toilet, Goldwyn <br />
felt no pity. <br />
<br />
The man laid on the floor of his cell, looking at the world barely understanding the world <br />
around him. Goldwyn put down 'Princess.' <br />
<br />
&quot;You killed my grandma.&quot; Goldwyn said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ehhh nevvah keeled anneh-boode... &quot; Said the hopeless drunk. <br />
<br />
Goldwyn narrowed her eyes as she knelt down began petting 'Princess.'  The face was the <br />
same, the clothes were the same, the smell was the same, the voice was the same, the <br />
sickly diseased and twisted aura was the same. This was the murderer.  Why waste time <br />
bowing down to rules that wasted everyone's time? <br />
<br />
Goldwyn had no idea, years ago, some superstitious paranoids, thought the same thing <br />
about skipping due process for her mother... <br />
<br />
This sad, broken mess of a man had murdered her grandmother over money she didn't <br />
have. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yer facesss... eh luuks leek ah skuuul...why wuud et luuk leek ah skuuul?&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldwyn ignored his comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You killed my grandma for money.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nevvah keeled anneh-boode! Nevvah keeled anneh-boode! Pupppeet strungs ... spiiidur <br />
wubs... spiidur en mah haaandez...Wei yah luuk leek ah skuul? Yuuu haave anni-monee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma before you murdered her said for me and my sisters to be good.&quot; Goldwyn said <br />
the air around her darkening by her mere presence, &quot;Before she was murdered by you, she <br />
told us to be good. And before she was murdered by you for money she didn't have she <br />
told us to listen to what Mr. Running-Bear said... Mr. Running-Bear said 'turning the other <br />
cheek' he says to forgive people.  My big sister Gita wants you to be a mouse and eaten by <br />
a snake for murdering our grandma... Mr. Running-Bear says revenge won't make her <br />
happy. Grandma said before you murderer her to listen to what Mr. Running-Bear says... I <br />
want my big sister to be happy... Mr. Running-bear says revenge won't make her happy... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wei yah luuk leek ah skuul? Du yuu hav' annee-boooze? Den wee caaan taulk, den everey-<br />
thang make send-ense. Yuuu smill leek floweres... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Adults almost never turn out right, why wouldn't anyone want to become an adult? If you <br />
were a child again, you'd just become an adult again and murder other people again... No <br />
one should have to become an adult... You need to be fixed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuu're gonna make et so ah can't have kittens?&quot; <br />
<br />
Goldwyn face palmed and she placed her palm on 'Princess'' back. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
The deranged drunken murderer began to shrink. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why... does your face... look like a skull?&quot;<br />
<br />
Goldwyn said nothing to the mad ramblings now. <br />
<br />
The lunatic continued to shrink, the hair on his head vanished, his arms and legs became <br />
cubby as did the rest of his body, his eyes becoming larger and rounder as his nose <br />
became tiny and his head larger to the rest of his body. <br />
<br />
As he continued to shrink, the murderer sat up, put his hands together on his belly, and his <br />
mind filled with the precious few memories he had of his mother before she died of small <br />
pox. He smiled, then grinned at the memories reliving them over and over in an endless <br />
loop. <br />
<br />
&quot;Consider this, me forgiving you.&quot; Goldwyn said her voice like frost. <br />
<br />
The murderer's body stiffened, becoming panted clay. <br />
<br />
Goldwyn looked ice cold at the life size figurine of a baby with it's hands together around <br />
his belly grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't quite suit you.&quot; <br />
<br />
 Her emotions below the surface a raging fire.  The human infant then morphed into the <br />
figurine of a newborn chimp the pose remaining the same. Resembling the forth chinese <br />
monkey whose proverb was 'Do no evil.' <br />
<br />
&quot;That suits you much better.&quot; She said to the soul that still existed in part within the small <br />
figurine. She left the jail house. She then hear men shouting about the prisoner having <br />
escaped naked into the snow, most figuring he'd freeze to death before getting far... <br />
<br />
&quot;I did good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You did very good Mistress Goldwyn... you did very good.&quot;<br />
<br />
She next visited the innkeeper who had found their grandmother five minutes too late. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? What? What are you doing here? Little Miss Goldwyn is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgive you... you did all you could... and... someone as well meaning as you... doesn't <br />
deserve to be a prisoner and a slave to this world of rules adults have forced everyone to <br />
live in. I have a game I wish to play with you.&quot; <br />
<br />
A few minutes later a lone and lonely Sasquatch wandered off with a dazed look in it's eyes <br />
out of the town toward the rocky mountains a thousand miles away. <br />
<br />
Goldwyn smiled and waved him off. She then calmly returned home. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Molly and Library cleaned though the library's basement, to rotate out the items that were <br />
kept in the tiny wing of the library that functioned as a make-shift museum.  Molly was <br />
concerned while her son hadn't called her today, but shrugged it off, she wasn't about to <br />
worry yet. Library was less concerned about Backdoor, she was a complete gargoyle, and <br />
she had Frontdoor, he had no reason to worry about her, they both had their duty and <br />
places to protect. <br />
<br />
As Molly went through what items were due for show or not she came across an item from <br />
Glendale's own personal history. <br />
<br />
It was the mask of a plague doctor: shaped like a bird's face based on the idea the plague <br />
was air born and could draw the plague from the victim and into the doctor's attire and <br />
containing a primitive gas mask. <br />
<br />
The records said it had belonged to one of the witch hunters who had killed the three <br />
witches who had brought upon Glendale The Game that everyone pretended wasn't there <br />
and the tourist board insisted didn't exist. <br />
<br />
One man theorized the hunters had in fact poisoned the witches to create the illusions of <br />
the plague to get them desperate and drop their guard, then disguised a plague doctor <br />
killed them in their sleep.  The holes in this theory were mind numbing (most notable on <br />
how there were to Molly's knowledge any plague doctors in colonial America to blend in <br />
with, and if they were poisoned why do something as contrived as that and not use a <br />
strong enough poison to just kill the witches?).<br />
<br />
Another was that the witches had been trapped in a burning building and the witch hunter <br />
had worn it to be fully effective in the smoke filled house leaving the witches at a <br />
disadvantage in a climatic battle. But this didn't match up with all records saying the <br />
witches had been executed. <br />
<br />
Molly's own theory, dismissed by the majority of the historical society, was that the mask <br />
had belonged to someone dear of the witch hunter and was a loving keep sake. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
The minister observed, &quot;You rather like dogs Marie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're better than cats.&quot; The short black hair lass smiled rubbing the loyal canine's head. <br />
<br />
&quot;As it would seem.&quot; The man nodded. &quot;I trust you finished your studies for today?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto <br />
him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. John eleven, thirty-<br />
nine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Very good.&quot; He tossed a coin in the air, the child in one motion took out a throwing knife <br />
and in half the same motion threw striking the coin easily.  &quot;You have been practicing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The devoted mutt itself stared in amazement at the feat the child had accomplished. <br />
<br />
&quot;As you've told me to papa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you forgiven the old man who tried to hurt you before yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie looked down, &quot;No, I haven't. .. I... I can -say- I've forgiven him... but... I feel exactly <br />
the same afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you haven't really forgiven him, I'm glade you can recognize that. Forgiveness is <br />
about letting go, if you don't, the weights will drag you down into darkness... And if you <br />
pass judgement on someone else, you face judgement yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes papa... you tell me everytime you go out to always remember that truth is god's world, <br />
but you keep telling me to tell adults I'm a boy... isn't that lying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If God had created a fair world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God should have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marie... if God had created a fair world, how would we prove we were fair?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz blinked at the worlds.<br />
<br />
&quot;... I'll explain when you're a bit older.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes papa.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So her god father was like a super-hero with a secret identity?&quot; Casandra now actually <br />
interested. <br />
<br />
Glass Marie nodded slowly, &quot;In a manner of speaking... he wanted to help people inside <br />
and outside the Vatican, and he occasionally made enemies of some very bad people. He <br />
had intended to hold onto Marie Cruz only until he found relatives of hers to hand her off <br />
to... he never found any. Thus how he ended up her god parent. A girl couldn't be an alter-<br />
boy however.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lawrence sighed waving his hand, &quot;And he was teaching a child how to use weapons <br />
be~cause?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly when he realized Marie would eventually be drawn into his double-life weather he <br />
liked it or not... &quot;<br />
<br />
Casandra asked, &quot;So are we going to learn who the other three hunters were or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marie didn't know weather or not the templar gargoyle would agree to her request. And <br />
she KNEW from her visions she'd -die- or -worse- if she tried to tackle the witches alone... <br />
one 'hunter' if you want to call him that, she didn't meet until she arrived in the colonies <br />
with Vatican and the other two. As you can imagine, it wasn't easy for a one-eyed woman <br />
who believed in magic in the seventeenth century to find allies.&quot;</p>
