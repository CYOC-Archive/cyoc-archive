<p>Miggs stood at the back of the room watching intently for a chance to free Prince Eodor and escape from the accursed place.  In the form of a demoness, she had been allowed free access to Igna's castle.  The occupants made the logical mistake of assuming she was just another minion as she'd made her way to the armory and fitted herself with the 'noble symbol' of the race of succubi that resided in the World of Chaos as well as a somewhat used broadsword.</p>

<p>Making her way to the throne room, she had arrived to fine Eodor and Igna together at the throne itself.  With them were the two large orcs as well as the succubus she had seen in the prince's prison.  Miggs was unable to hear what the two were saying, but soon it mattered not.  Igna reached out quickly, pulling Eodor up to her and into a passionate embrace.  Further confusing the issue, the two of them promptly passed out after the kiss was finished.</p>

<p>This chain of events made no sense to Miggs, but she thought she had found herself and opening.  She took a few steps forward with the intention of freeing the prince by force but could not ignore the nagging sensation that something was terribly wrong here.  The orcs at the princesses side stepped up beside her, picking her up into their powerful arms as she awoke.  The single succubus stepped over to Eodor, her hands resting on the ropes that tied him to the altar.</p>

<p>Moving forward several steps, Miggs reached the base of the stairs leading up to the throne with her hand on the hilt of her sword when both Eodor and Igna suddenly snapped awake.  Pausing in place, Miggs' hand wavered as she waited to see the outcome of this spell.  It only took a moment, as Eodor looked up briefly and started cackling maniacally.  He called out: "It worked! My potion worked!"</p>

<p>For her part, Igna looked very confused.  She slowly stood up.  "Why would Igna cast a spell on me to put me in a dress?" she'd muttered softly to herself, "And why does my voice sound funny?"  Her eyes then grew wide as she noticed her own hands.  Igna stared at them for several seconds, then her head moved down and she gave a hard look at her own breasts.  The startled, gawking expression on her face almost looked comical to Miggs.  Igna looked up at Eodor and yelped in surprise: "What?! That's… <i>me!</i> And I'm… I'm…"</p>

<p>Prince Eodor was still cackling.  The reaction of Igna appeared quite humorous to him as well.  "Yes!  Now you see my plan," he sneered.  "I told you I wanted to <i>personally</i> take the crown of Quell.  As it sands, the crown will freely be given to me once I have your father killed," he said and went back to cackling again.</p>

<p>Even a troll could figure out what had happened, and luckily Miggs was <i>no</i> troll.  Momentarily, she considered how luck she was to be in this youthful and powerful body rather than something so hideous as a troll… but that very line of thinking interrupted her thoughts only briefly.  She <i>was</i> stunned, to be sure. The very idea that Igna would go so far to gain control over Quell as to <i>trade bodies</i> with Prince Eodor?  Astounding!</p>

<p>In the prince's body, Igna was being untied from the altar by the succubus.  To his guards, he said: "Take the new <i>'princess'</i> back into the tower.  And <i>do</i> be careful with her… I might like to return to my own body some day."  The grin he gave was far too twisted to belong to the prince that Miggs had protected for so many years, but there it was.</p>

<p>As the two orcs each held the former body of Igna, Eodor began to struggle.  "Careful with her," the succubus at the prince's body said to them.  "Your strength is great, but I expect to find <i>'her'</i> unharmed when I inspect her this evening," she hissed at them.</p>

<p>Miggs saw opportunity in this, and stepped up the short steps towards the throne.  "If I might," she said, her hands out towards Eodar's pale white feminine hand, "The prince knows I will not harm him without first being ordered to.  He does <i>not</i> know that of the orcs, nor would it be <i>true</i>," she found herself hissing towards the two green forms.  The males groaned a response to her statement, but she noticed it not.  Instead, she noted how easily that hiss had parted her lips.</p>

<p>The succubus at Igna's side finished untying him and looked towards Miggs.  "You again, churl?" she glared towards her.  "You are not meant to be here.  Your punishment&#151;"</p>

<p>"Will be severe," Miggs finished, looking towards her.  "So much so that I will beg for death, yes, mistress?  And what of your own punishment should Lady Igna's body be wounded or killed when you order two mindless orcs to drag the <i>'princess'</i> back to her tower prison?" she sneered, eyes returning the succubus' glare in kind.  "<i>I</i> will take her to the tower, unharmed, while you attend the new prince, our Lady."</p>

<p>The succubus was furious at this aggressive stance a youngling would take with her.  "To take such a tone," Igna said before the succubus at his side could.  Finally he stood upright upon his new legs.  "You must either be growing a <i>spine</i> or be nearing your Time of Enchantment," the young man smiled to the succubus that was Miggs.  "Or <i>both</i>," he grinned.  "I agree the orcs might be too forceful, but I trust your superior knows what she asked.  <i>Surely,</i> she wouldn't wish any harm to befall the prince… knowing I might one day need him again," Igna said, looking to the succubus.  "Is that right, Henry?"</p>

<p>The scaled woman stood upright, "Yes, Lady Igna," she said to the prince.  "Never since the Gift of Eternal Life had been bestowed upon me have I ever dared to dream of a time without you.  You are my master.  You own my soul, and I shall be loyal to the end," she said, but her stance was nervous and full of lies.</p>

<p>"No doubt," Igna said, unconvinced.  "You, youngling… take this… lovely thing," he said, running her hand through Eodor's red hair, "…to her room.  The orcs will accompany and guard the champer," he smiled to Miggs with a nod.  Looking towards Henry, he smiled, "You and I shall speak of this later," he said with a grin.</p>

<p>Miggs looked into Eodor's eyes and hoped the prince understood his actions.  If the two of them were ever going to make it out of this place alive, they would need the group at large to remain unaware of Miggs' true self.  As the two woman stepped down from the throne and headed towards the exit of the room, Miggs couldn't help but find no solace in the thought that she was hidden among the monsters… What was the Time of Enchantment?  How were they to reverse a spell that Igna had spent years researching?  And what of this other succubus?  Henry was a man's name, and had obviously served in Igna's court for many years as a succubus that she had <i>pride</i> in it… but who <i>was</i> 'he'?</p>

<p>Stepping outside the Throne Room, Miggs considered their next move.</p></p>
