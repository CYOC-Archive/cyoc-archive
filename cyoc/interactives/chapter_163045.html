<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Underwear was an awkward topic for me. I’ve tried so many types but just never found anything I liked. For thirteen years I wore briefs, but once I hit middle school I was bullied because of them. I switched to boxers, but I found them too loose to comfortably hold my junk. I then started wearing boxer-briefs, but all the ones I tried chaffed badly. I even tried jock straps and g-strings, but I needed a little bit more protection than that. <br />
<br />
I was beginning to give up hope, until one day when I was scrolling through Amazon. I was searching for underwear, hoping I would find ones I liked. <br />
<br />
I was out of high school and lived on my own, so I thought maybe I should go back to briefs. I didn’t see anything wrong with briefs. I only stopped wearing them because I was made fun of, but that wouldn’t happen anymore.<br />
<br />
I scrolled pictures of men with perfect bodies that modeled different types of briefs. Suddenly a pop-up ad flashed over my screen. I usually exit out of them quickly but this one caught my eye.<br />
<br />
The ad showed a man in white briefs happily lying on a bed next to a beautiful woman. It was obvious they had just had sex. Next to the picture were the words “Have the best sex of your life with Hane’s new briefs! Your whole life will change for the better!<br />
<br />
I was curious. Could this underwear improve my sex life? I mean, what did I have to lose? <br />
<br />
I decided to order a ten-pack. <br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
The package arrived three days later. I tore open the box and removed the underwear. They didn’t look any different than the white briefs I used to wear as a kid, except they were obviously much larger. <br />
<br />
I slid the underwear on. A perfect fit. The elastic hugged my waist perfectly, and the pouch cradled my genitals comfortably.<br />
<br />
“I’ve finally done it,” I said. “I’ve found the perfect underwear.”<br />
<br />
All of a sudden I got extremely horny, as if I needed to have sex immediately. I didn’t know why but for some reason I suspected the underwear. I tried to take them off... but they were stuck to my body.<br />
<br />
I doubled over, now feeling extreme pleasure. It felt like a constant orgasm - the best orgasm I’ve ever had. What was going on?<br />
<br />
Then I felt it. Inside my underwear, something was moving. No, something was growing. <br />
<br />
I moaned with ecstasy, unable to control. God it felt so good. I looked down and saw a small tent in the white briefs. But after a few seconds it wasn’t small anymore.<br />
<br />
The fabric of the underwear stretched and strained under the force of my dick growing outward.<br />
<br />
A huge wave of pleasure washed over me and I knew I was cumming. I looked down and sure enough there was a wet cum spot at the tip of the bulge, which was still growing. <br />
<br />
I didn’t know how to stop it. But maybe I didn’t want to stop it. I had never experienced something that felt this incredible.<br />
<br />
A ripping sound echoed around my apartment. The white briefs were laying on the floor in ruins. But I was still growing. My cock stretched upward and reached my nipples. My balls had to be the size of grapefruits.<br />
<br />
I couldn’t help myself: I moaned as I grabbed my dick and started jerking off. My face was getting red. I had been experiencing the pleasure of an orgasm for almost two minutes. I didn’t know how long I could take it. <br />
<br />
Eventually I stopped growing. My penis was almost three feet long and as thick as my biceps. My balls hung low and were the size of cantaloupes. I had to be dreaming.<br />
<br />
I kept rubbing my throbbing cock, still feeling the waves of pleasure. I started licking the head of my dick and tried to fit it in my mouth but it was too big. I reached down and played with my giant balls. <br />
<br />
After one final lick up the shaft, I climaxed. I released a moan that I’m sure my entire apartment building heard as I ejaculated loads of hot sperm all over the walls. I almost passed out from the rapture that cascaded over my body. <br />
<br />
I shot out sticky cum for a solid thirty seconds, releasing everything that had built up in my giant ball sack. <br />
<br />
I slumped to the floor, breathing heavily. I looked around. “This is going to take a while to clean up,” I thought. The walls were dripping in cum. <br />
<br />
After a couple minutes of sitting on the floor recovering, my genitals started shrinking back to their normal size. I was kind of disappointed but also thankful. I was starting to get worried about how I would fit my new package into my pants.<br />
<br />
My balls shriveled back up to the size of apples and my dick sunk down and became seven inches flaccid. “Woah,” I thought. “They’re still huge.” I figured I would still be able to stuff them into my pants, though I would have an enormous bulge.<br />
<br />
I looked over at where my ruined underwear was, but it was no longer in pieces. It looked just like it did before I tried it on. I could tell it didn’t have its abilities anymore though. <br />
<br />
I tried it on - still a perfect fit. My bulge however was extremely prominent, but that was something I wasn’t worried about.<br />
<br />
I suddenly wished I could have my three foot long penis back for a while, but then remembered: I had ordered a ten-pack and I could order more.<br />
<br />
I now had the power to grow my genitals whenever I felt like it. <br />
<br />
I grabbed a second pair and raced to my bedroom, pre-um already dripping through my new white briefs. The advertisement was right: my whole life had changed for the better.</p>
