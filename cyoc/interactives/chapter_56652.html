<br />
Gillie kept hearing the word 'reverting back', 'Does that mean these wolf people and cat <br />
people when they're born look like mundane animal and get their thumbs and biped status <br />
a short time after?' Gillie wish she knew, sometimes being the only sane person in the <br />
world sucked.  'No. There's still Serenity... at least I can count on her to never change or <br />
get swept up in reality covering it's own ass.' <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Abbey asked worried, &quot;Miss Afua wouldn't be sent off after the hunters would she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Marie-Eliza shook her head slowly, &quot;She was a gargoyle now, defensive strategy was <br />
ingrained into her.  And the witches knew at this point they just had to out wait the 'hunter <br />
army' wherever that might be.&quot; <br />
<br />
Samantha said, &quot;Never mind there was no hunter army.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The witches didn't know that, and that was why they didn't decide to again venture out to <br />
attack the hunter, certain that they had an army waiting for him. If they had, they likely <br />
would have annihilated Marie Cruz and the rest. And their world of lunatics they'd call free <br />
but in reality regulated by the witches would have come about with little opposition.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice merely stayed silent for once in her life. <br />
<br />
&quot;The witches at this point just had to sit in their fortress waiting for the spell they had <br />
placed over Glendale to reach critical mass. <br />
<br />
In the fear and panic, of course Mal'Akh hadn't noticed that Joella's eyes hadn't glowed <br />
while the other children channeled the witches' power to level beyond anything else they <br />
could have before. <br />
<br />
A very gruesome thought occurred to the little girl, 'Does Aimiliona still exist?' She felt a <br />
chill go down her tail, 'Or is there now just a demon inside her body where her soul used to <br />
be? Familiars are supposed to be angels of the devil sent to serve witches in another form <br />
aren't they? And what they turned that poor human into...' Mal'Akh recounted what the <br />
puritans had told her about witches. Mal'Akh fell to her knees and vomited. <br />
<br />
Abbey asked, &quot;Was Afua really a suck-you-bus now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Marie-Eliza answered her mother embracing her from behind, &quot;Angels, rebel or <br />
loyalist, are spirits, beings that normally don't have a material form. People simple <br />
depicted angels with bird wings and demons with bat wings because more people like birds <br />
than bats. Afua's form was chosen out of SPITE of the God whom Marie Cruz served, much <br />
like the Satanist movement chose THEIR name out of spite rather than any devil worship. <br />
And the witches figured that if demons opposed an 'unfair and jealous' god, that the <br />
demons themselves must be logically good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is insane...&quot; Lawrence said simply, everyone looked at him, &quot;Oh right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Afua meanwhile assumed a short bowing position before the three witches who had given <br />
her the power to protect herself from her old master and the killers he had sent after her. <br />
And the promise to free all those she was forced to leave behind in fell swoop. <br />
<br />
Deep down, a tiny voice in Afua called out, 'You're just trading one set of masters for <br />
another!'  But the gargoyle that had been Afua replied to that tiny voice, 'But this time is MY <br />
choice, and that makes all the difference!' And the tiny voice died. <br />
<br />
And in Afua's stone innards, a much stronger voice called out, an instinct that screamed <br />
like the instinct to breath had. '-Guard and Protect!-' Afua thought about that, and felt a <br />
strange and powerful detachment to her name, like it no longer mattered to her, like it was <br />
just a meaningless sound. <br />
<br />
True it had been the first and only gift her parents had ever given her. But that seemed to <br />
meaningless now. 'Where and what I protect is who I am.' The thought thundered in her <br />
mind. <br />
<br />
She looked at the children looking back at her in awe and wonder, she looked at the <br />
witches who looked back in delight, and the fours walls around her... And she thought of <br />
the witch's said. She thought of what she was now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; Gaal and Lilith tilted their heads. <br />
<br />
&quot;My name, is Free.&quot; <br />
<br />
The witches and familiars looked at each other, somewhat surprised, since they had <br />
created her much like they had created the weapons from an age absurdly distant to their <br />
own. While copying it with their vast magic, letting the force itself do all the practical <br />
details, they hadn't known much of gargoyles except what their family had taught during <br />
their early life in Europe. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to our family Free.&quot; Gaal finally said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone!&quot; Called Gomorrah, &quot;Come here and greet Free!&quot; <br />
<br />
So Joella, and the child familiars behind her, and the leoman last, slowly lined up and <br />
began to shake the hand and greet the newest member of their circle. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;SISTER CRUZ! SISTER CRUZ!&quot; Mal'akh tirelessly ran, fall on her hands and knees more than <br />
once before the leoman cub got up again, not biologically built for endurance running.  By <br />
the time she stumbled into Running-Bear's home, she practically fell asleep on the floor. <br />
<br />
She came too a minute or so later, with two of the hunters hunters and the old man <br />
looking over her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sister Cruz, my sister, a woman, everyone, she, they, how could she-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down.&quot; Sister Cruz said. &quot;What happened Mal'Akh? Did they find you out? Did <br />
something happen to your sister? What's wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They... they took a woman who they found at their house and... she was human, a slave, <br />
and... she ASKED THEM TO MAKE HER A MONSTER!&quot;<br />
<br />
Linus, Marie, and Running-Bear all stepped back at this.  <br />
<br />
&quot;She was scared her master would find her, the witches suggested making her like, like Mr. <br />
Vatican... and she WANTED THEM TO... they made her into a stone demon... and... <br />
Aimiliona HELPED THEM... her eyes glowed, all their eyes glowed... is my sister still there? <br />
Or is she a demon now too?&quot; <br />
<br />
The three human adults looked at each other. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Free climbed to the top of the house, which supported her weight due to magic and <br />
Benjamin and the Witch Pride's hard work. The stone succubus felt a wave of content as she <br />
silently watched over the grounds that were the home of the witches who had freed her. <br />
Gargoyles did not experience boredom or impatience, but Free did however enjoy the <br />
fantasy images of killing the hunters and slavers in various creative and agonizing ways. <br />
<br />
If the Puritans still had the sense to noticed, they would have been nothing less than up at <br />
arms over the witches' latest addition, enraged and armed ready to demand it's removal or <br />
theirs. As it was only two people in Glendale still had the wits to really notice or care. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Kathrine with her good arm hugged the crying and near hysterical Mal'Akh... wishing she <br />
had taken more lessons from her sisters when she had the chance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your sister isn't a demon now,&quot; Marie Cruz promised doing her best to use terms the little <br />
girl was likely to understand, &quot;She's just possessed, I promise once the witches are dealt <br />
with we'll have her and the rest of the children back tot themselves.&quot; 'I pray I'm not just <br />
lying again.' <br />
<br />
Marie left Linus and Kathrine to deal with Mal'Akh's heart break, Marie.. had bad experience <br />
with children. <br />
<br />
Draco of course followed, walking VERY carefully not to damage his wings more as they <br />
slowly healed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marie?&quot; The dragon asked once they were outside and away from ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;All my life Draco, not always, but often enough, I've been back at that mausoleum, forced <br />
to kill innocents who had no choice in what they had become or what they were doing... <br />
that girl, Meranda, and that leoman Frank, no, not 'that.' They. They're dead because I <br />
couldn't find a better solution. Now I'm worried I'm going to be stuck in that mausoleum <br />
again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You told me on our boat trip, the nosferatu?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Marie you're not a child yourself anymore, and you know it, and these children aren't just <br />
corpses being animated by a curse, they're alive!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that. Just what Mal'Akh said brought it all back the surface.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You'll be alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. But I will be.&quot;</p>
