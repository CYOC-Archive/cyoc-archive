<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AN: Part Two of Two On The Way Uber Fast!<br />
<br />
It was interesting that Mother Glen had said 'other pride members' to the two triplets <br />
but of course there was Trevor's family, and the friends he had called on the phone had <br />
by now hugged or similarly interacted with the parents they loved and who loved them <br />
back triggering their transformation via reality shift into more civilized Leomans which <br />
would continue the cascade. Like a benign version of the 'gray goo' scenario. <br />
<br />
Amy didn't go very far at all, she too some paces between Penny and Mother Glenn, <br />
and where Kirk was refereeing the topaz colored wolf cub Paula and the odd mix of <br />
orange and brownish red. Most concluded the unique fur colors were either dormant <br />
genes or simply benign mutations from living in a area as saturated with magic as <br />
Glendale. <br />
<br />
Kirk said between the two standing tall his golden brown mane framing his muzzle and <br />
face,   &quot;Remember the basic rules of wresting: no biting, no clawing, no injury to the <br />
eye, no choking, and no striking someone between the legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both cub and pup nodded at that, given how leomans and lupmans went around in the <br />
buff nearly constantly, they knew that striking a female between the legs could be even <br />
more damaging and painful than to a male, contrary to myth. <br />
<br />
Paula asked, &quot;Like humens?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kirk politely corrected her, &quot;It's pronounced 'humans' dear, humans, like leomans, <br />
felmans, lupmans.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paula blinked then nodded, &quot;Oh okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy looked at Paula and Saba. 'Though they're about the same age give or take, Saba's <br />
easily taller than Paula, then again, a full adult Leoman is eleven feet tall like Kirk, and <br />
a female is nine feet tall like Penny. The Lupman peak adult is nine feet tall like <br />
Jensen-Sama and seven feet tall was usually peak female like Kaylee-Sama. Heh...it's a <br />
wonder all three species can function in the same society at all, our sizes are all so <br />
different... I wonder if that Felman family has it easier.' <br />
 <br />
Penny was of course trapped on what to say to her Matriarch, the mere idea of lying to <br />
her actually threatened to cause her brain to freeze up, 'A LEOMAN DOES NOT LIE TO <br />
THE MATRIARCH OF THEIR PRIDE!' Echoed so hard on her mind it nearly cause her to <br />
fall over on her side. She was just glade the blood was drying fast. She didn't want it <br />
smeared. <br />
<br />
'I wonder what our Pride name is.... we can't be just The Pride, if the Pack is the Big Bad <br />
Wolf Pack... I wonder if it'll turn out to be the Simba Pride... or the 'Kimba' Pride, that is <br />
where Disney got the inspiration for The Lion King.' <br />
<br />
MOther Glen leaned in closer and Penny quickly covered it with her paw, &quot;It's private <br />
grandma.&quot; Penny said quickly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Private enough to keep from your own Matriarch?&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny's gut shivered at keeping things from her Matriarch, from what she was feeling, <br />
the Pride didn't have the same rigid pecking order that the Pack had once had, each <br />
family within the pride was equal, maybe cause they tended to overlap... this left <br />
Mother Glen as it's final and ultimate authority figure except against perhaps a <br />
combined veto decision of every single male in the pride (whose 'vote' in turn were <br />
almost purely decided by the combined decisions of his mates). <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes...&quot; She managed to croak out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes grandmother.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But WHY your own blood? That CAN'T be healthy in your condition.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny almost felt like the four legged lioness before her could see into her soul almost. <br />
&quot;It's... part of a ritual I recently learned from Amy on how to memorize something <br />
without fail, so much has happened recently I want to make sure I don't forget a single <br />
thing... you can look at it after I've married Kirk if you like but I'd rather no one read it <br />
until it's finished and gone over it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... I believe then that I SHALL read it. I expect to have a copy as soon as, or just <br />
before you leave on your honeymoon with Kirk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes grandmother...&quot; Penny sighed. &quot;Your mother, father, and Kirk's parents are all <br />
serving the Pack currently in looking after our wounded... you should consider yourself <br />
lucky... the twins implied some of them might not walk again at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Penny's blood turned to ice at that. She almost started lamenting having missed her <br />
chance to be there for her Pride but forced it down like bile, she had to continue. She <br />
couldn't be tied down by the past. &quot;Yes Mother Glen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe I shall be observing the pups and the cubs game for the rest of the evening.&quot; <br />
Fur made night not as much a deal, and night vision even less so. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mother Glen.&quot; Said Penny as the sun was setting and the stars beginning to come <br />
out. <br />
<br />
Mother Glen went to side besides Mr. P to observe the festivities like the large and <br />
bouncy Amethyst and the multi-arm Omega-Whitney did they best to keep things from <br />
getting out of control. <br />
<br />
The five fountain heads watched the fun and games. <br />
<br />
'That Mother Glen,' Said Kira having heard what the white lioness had to say through <br />
Michelle's senses back when she was in the medical wing. 'She thinks that living art are <br />
idiots, how about we teach her some first hand experience?'<br />
<br />
'NO!' Came the opposing vote from the other four bust statues though from a outside <br />
observer they remained silent grinning as water poured out their nipples into the basin. <br />
<br />
'She's entitled to her opinion.' Said Nelson/Nessie. <br />
<br />
Michelle added, 'She's just thinking about others. Nothing wrong with that.'  <br />
<br />
Helen then spoke, 'Besides, it would cause way too much confusion in everyone brains I <br />
think if the part of the minds that remembered the Matriarch of their Pride suddenly <br />
became camouflaged from their memory.' <br />
<br />
'I guess you're right.' Thought Kira. <br />
<br />
'You know,' Leslie said have silently thought all this time as was her right as a statue <br />
after all, 'The ability of ours to turn others into living art and open them to our <br />
thoughts wasn't in the original Transform, and we've been showing other talents that <br />
weren't part of the original Transform either... The original mind of the game is dead. <br />
So it isn't that. So why?' <br />
<br />
'Anthropic Principle.' Said Nessie/Nelson. <br />
<br />
'What?' Leslie asked. <br />
<br />
'The principle that states that the conditions for sentient life are possible in the <br />
universe because otherwise we wouldn't be here.'<br />
<br />
'I don't see what that has to do with how the Transform was interpreted.' <br />
<br />
'I'll explain. I think the game's power and interpretation is now purely directed by the <br />
person speaking and the person hearing the Transform or Dare... after all, it's mind is <br />
dead, all that's left is the mind of the person using it and receiving it.'<br />
<br />
'I see.' Leslie said, 'Because language is always up for interpretation, and with the <br />
original programming and mind of the game gone, that means whoever is using the <br />
game and who is subject to the game fills in the interpretation themselves, thus <br />
avoiding the Literal Genie principle.'<br />
<br />
'Exactly.'<br />
<br />
'I get it,' Michelle said, 'Like when we made Jay and Pence one of us for a short time, <br />
they were able to become flesh and blood again without a majority vote, so that <br />
logically wouldn't have been to do with that part of the Transform.'<br />
<br />
'Maybe it has to do with the envitability of us wanting company, and someone deciding <br />
they didn't want to silently mentally record eternity after all.'<br />
<br />
'Well we HAVE given up ever going to the theater or the circus ever again.' Kira said.<br />
<br />
'Technically we could use our power to sneak in without paying, but that feels like <br />
eating your cake and having it too.' Nelson/Nessie said. <br />
<br />
All four other busty fountain heads conceded to that.   <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Mbili, Toni, and Jay were pack at the score board as the sides lined up and <br />
at Amethyst's signal began to shoot each other again. <br />
<br />
One of the fountains seems to fizz out when Moja tried to refill but it started working <br />
again quickly.<br />
<br />
'KIRA! That's cheating!' Leslie chastised.<br />
<br />
'Sorry, just having some fun.'<br />
<br />
Laura and Zulema made the mistake of trying to refill their guns at the same time and <br />
the dark furred Tatuli kamikazed herself to tackle both into the water basin leaving all <br />
three soaked. For a minute instead of three eight year old and some months cub and <br />
pups there were two teenage leo-womans and one teenage lup-woman statues in the <br />
basin to double size scale posed like the three graces. Tatuli had to admit it felt very <br />
familiar. The three climbed out of the basin a minute later and without a word to each <br />
other went to the 'loser-vile' scored board with the other 'causalities.' <br />
<br />
Amethyst was signing the lyrics so some action anime she had heard Alpha-Kaylee <br />
singing to herself in the shower once, no having a clue but Amy  what the words were <br />
but at least it sounded upbeat. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So... that was her?&quot; Mal'akh asked. &quot;The Matriarch for the pack now?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That is her.&quot; Gary answered to the female jewish leoman who had spent centuries as a <br />
statue in the gallery. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish she had stayed to speak with us...&quot; Said Arael, &quot;We've all been frozen for so <br />
long. Just watching the world go by... we all had families... my granddaughter was the <br />
one who found me and realized who I was! By then my son was dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Armisael added, &quot;Don't feel too bad... I think we're so all so banged up and with so <br />
leoman and lupman about and so, so much blood and pans that our scents were hard <br />
to pick up... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also.&quot; Said Beta-Darla setting he bandage on Gabriel broken jaw and handed him <br />
something to write with, &quot;Don't forget that you are all supposed to be resting as best <br />
you can. Mother Glen came here to let you all know she loves you. As we the pack all <br />
love our Alphas.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Still want to be prisoners of your own bodies?&quot; Mal'Akh asked of the Hokkaido <br />
Lupmans. <br />
<br />
&quot;There is a difference between a prisoner and a hermit. And there is a difference <br />
between a slave and one who serves willingly.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You had families that were all robbed of you.&quot; Akane said staying here her mate and <br />
sister-wife while her other two sister-wives got some much needed sleep so they could <br />
cycle hovering over their pack-mates. &quot;You have friends who never learned what <br />
happened to you. You were sold off as if you were property. Besides....&quot; Akane then <br />
said, &quot;Is eternity really so bad, as long as you have someone you love to SHARE it with?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mal'akh couldn't think of an answer to that. <br />
<br />
Gabriel wrote, 'I just hope once the four of us are back on our feet we can  be formally <br />
reinstated into the Pride... '<br />
<br />
&quot;I just hope we don't have to do our first hunt all over again.&quot; Said Mal'Akh. <br />
<br />
Brian and Felicity looked at each other, looking at these four leoman was like looking <br />
through a window of the past almost... it was a question of what would happen once <br />
the historians got their hands on them and began asking them one question after <br />
another... <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Amy returned to her unoffical partner in crime and considered asking 'are you okay' <br />
but knew that was a meaningless question and instead asked, &quot;Is all as it should be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm thinking about what you said, about a piece of the game escaping being <br />
destroyed.&quot;  'Someone with a turn leaving Glendale, then coming back after the town is <br />
blessed... ' Penny shuddered, 'God! If you're up there! If you're really up there! If I really <br />
have to live as Penny for all of my existence! Then please! I beg you! DON'T let that <br />
happen! It would be the ultimate and utter sick mockery of -everything- we've lost, <br />
sacrificed and earned so far!' <br />
<br />
Amy said, &quot;The good news is that both sets of quadruplets can sense magic and <br />
determine it's type, meaning that if a trace of the game still exists outside of Glendale <br />
after Kurse's implosion wiped out all the turns already outside of Glendale, they'll be <br />
able to find it easily... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who were they? From before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Penny-San, that is something under no circumstances I have even the slightest <br />
intention of ever telling you.  I swear by Amaterasu that is something you are better off <br />
not knowing.  They are all now children without a mother, and the full weight of that <br />
will hit them hard after the shock and the aversion fades. You and the other Pride's <br />
lionesses need to be there for them. That is what you do need to know.&quot; Amy said with <br />
more firmness than Penny thought was possible, those eyes looked like they could <br />
stand up to Mother Glen. Then again, Ami herself had the courage to challenge the will <br />
of the descendant of the sun himself...  So... you wish to forget being Penn?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to remember a life I now never had if Kirk isn't. It's like I'm an impostor <br />
standing in for his fiancee.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I understand, but please remember this, you ARE Penn, just with different DNA, just <br />
like your fiancee. Your love for each hasn't been altered in the slightest.&quot; <br />
<br />
Penny tilted her head, &quot;What about you and your wife/brother?&quot; 'Had she mentioned <br />
that?' <br />
<br />
Amy remembered, meeting at that dance Ryan hadn't wanted to go to, that first dance <br />
... that first kiss. Amy shuddered. &quot;For me... It's just one in a line of lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I think of that, you get to live once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll find out who is right at the end I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Penny-san, if that's what you really want, you can just it go. You can focus your power <br />
and WILL the traces of Penn from you. But first, there is something we need to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was waiting until you had written down the basics of what you wished to write down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A life story takes more than an afternoon to write.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, that's why I said the basics. I wished for us to decide on this before what we've <br />
written is down is all that remains of Ryan and Penn.&quot;</p>
