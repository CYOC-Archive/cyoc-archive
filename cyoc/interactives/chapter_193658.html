<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By Luke Wolffe <br />
How could I have been so stupid? Xane thought to himself for what seemed like the millionth time as he sat there staring at his beer. He may not be crazy about living so far from home, but at least he had a decent bar to go to. The good thing about this bar... There were hardly ever any women there. The local women often described Zurk&#39;s as dark and depressing. Of course it was dark, bars have had low lighting for centuries. You just didn&#39;t make a bar all bright and colorful the way most of the perky overly happy bitches in the area would have it. Yep... The lack of women was definitely a plus. <br />
&quot;You&#39;re not seriously still moping about that bitch are you?&quot; <br />
Xane&#39;s best friend plopped onto the stool beside him. Eric and Xane had been best buds since they were five. Xane was still tall and slender as he&#39;d always been, the only difference now was the six pack abs and fair amount of muscle he had gained over the years. His hair was still a sandy blonde and his eyes were still the same shade of faded denim they had always been. Eric was a different story. As a boy he had been short and husky. Now he stood about six foot, a few inches shorter than Xane, his once rounded body now toned and muscular, almost wild. He still had the same jet-black hair and emerald green eyes though. <br />
 &quot; You&#39;re so much better off without her dude... Bitch was psycho, and dumber than... Oh what&#39;s that old saying... &#39;dumber than a box of rocks&#39; that&#39;s it. Count yourself lucky bro.&quot; &quot; Yea...&quot; Xane muttered as he took another sip of his, now very warm, beer. He tossed a five on the counter and made for the door. <br />
 It was no secret that Eric had never been fond of Latisha. Of course as he constantly reminded Xane, he had a motto he had lived by since they were teenagers. &#39;Fuck & forget. Anything more will just give you a headache.&#39; Headache? More like searing migraine. No more women for me... No thank you. Maybe Eric was right. With that thought, he headed home, if you could even call it that. <br />
Xane was the captain of the Zonarr X7-53. A huge space station that was originally part of an experiment to see if people would be healthier and have longer lives living in a completely controllable environment. As luck would have it, Xane was the only person that met all of the qualifications for the job, or so they told him. That meant uprooting him and Latisha from their cozy 1 bedroom house in Casper, Wyoming and moving them into the equivalent of a studio apartment on the Zonarr. <br />
Once Xane was back in the apartment, he mindlessly grabbed a slice of leftover pizza and a can of beer from the fridge. Flopping into his chair, he grabbed the remote and flicked on the TV only to find that the commlink was on the fritz... again. With a groan he flicked the TV off and tossed the remote back onto the coffee table. He was exhausted. Eric was right. With that thought, Xane fell into a deep sleep. <br />
The sound of birds and rustling leaves surrounded him. He was at his dad&#39;s farm in Riverton. He could hear the chickens out back in their coop. The screen door swung open with a loud smack. Mrs. Black stood in the doorway, hands planted firmly on her hips. She was thinner than he remembered, her once vibrant red hair now highlighted with hints of gray, but she still had that same fire she&#39;d had since Xane was a boy. <br />
 &quot;Are you just going to stand out there like a scarecrow or are you gonna come give me a hug?&quot; <br />
Her face broke into a warm smile as she made her way towards him. She wrapped him in a motherly embrace and gave him a peck on the cheek. Holding him at arms length she frowned, &quot;Lord child you&#39;re skin and bones! Now you come on in and let ol&#39; Mrs. Black fix you something to eat. I got a pot roast in the oven but it won&#39;t be done &#39;til  supper&quot;. Mrs. Black continued to ramble on about how skinny he was, how he would be better off coming home to work for his daddy on the farm. It was a routine he had gotten used to ever since his first visit to the farm after moving off to college. The lectures didn&#39;t bother him though, it was Mrs. Black&#39;s way of showing how much she cared about him, as though he were her own son. As Xane took his usual seat at the large kitchen table, the phone rang. Mrs. Black apparently didn&#39;t notice as she continued to cook. The ringing grew loud and distorted until it was all he could hear. <br />
Xane snapped awake, he was in his chair, pizza and beer still in his hands. He looked around for the source of the noise. It was his alarm clock, it was a quarter after seven. Shit! The physical! Xane rushed to get ready. He was suppose to meet with the senior medical advisor at eight o&#39;clock for his six month physical. <br />
Xane practically sprinted through the corridors to the medical wing. Please don&#39;t be late, please don&#39;t be late! He skidded to a stop right outside the double doors labeled Medical Wing. Trying to catch his breath, Xane entered the lobby and made for the reception desk. Glancing at the clock he winced, eight thirty... Hopefully the doc was busy today and wouldn&#39;t notice. From the looks of the lobby, probably not. <br />
“Ahh, Captain Sully, your late. Please follow me. My name is Dr. Demitri Vaughn. I was just transferred to the station a week ago. I was pleased to see that you were due for your six month checkup.” <br />
Demitri stood at five foot ten inches, with a well built body and spacious blue eyes that went great with his dark blonde hair. The two men walked down the hall towards an empty room. Xane was starting to feel his pants getting stiff while walking next to Demitri. <br />
What is wrong with me, I am attracted to women not men.  Xane thought to himself. <br />
Demitri glanced over at Xane, quickly scanning his toned figure in those deliciously tight jeans. In all my years, I’ve never seen such a gorgeous man. I wonder if he tastes as good as he looks. With that thought, Demitri’s cock twitched. Shaking away that thought, he led Xane into the empty examination room. <br />
“You’ll need to undress for the physical. You may keep your underwear on if you wish.” Hopefully you won’t. Demitri’s cock twitched again, this time more noticeably. <br />
Demitri prepared the tools he needed to give Xane the physical while Xane got undressed. Demitri looked at Xane and noticed that Xane was half erect. Demitri looked away as Xane looked at him. <br />
“I am ready to start, doctor.&quot; Xane said. <br />
Demitri cleared his throat and started the exam. Xane is extremely fit... and alluringly proportioned. Demitri shrugged the thought away. No... I can&#39;t keep lusting him. I must be professional. Even if he is extremely well endowed. No! I am a professional medical advisor, not a hormone driven teenager. Demitri continued the exam, being sure to keep his view from straying below the waistline. The exam was almost over. So far so good. Only the prostrate exam left. Shit... <br />
&quot;The exam is just about done Mr. Sully, only thing left is the prostate exam.&quot; Demitri said, trying his best to keep his tone purely professional. <br />
As Demitri performed the exam, Xane&#39;s cock grew a bit. Xane suddenly wished he had kept his underwear on. His face grew hot and his heart raced. &quot;...perfect...&quot; Dr. Vaughn&#39;s voice seemed somewhat far away. Xane snapped back to reality. &quot;What?&quot; he asked, a bit light headed. Demitri made some notes on Xane&#39;s chart. &quot;You&#39;re perfectly healthy.&quot; Demitri repeated, making sure to avoid eye contact. <br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; Xane said while quickly getting dressed, &quot;gotta go doc&quot; and he all but ran from the exam room and into the main corridor. <br />
After catching his breath, Xane made his way to the command center to get the station update. Xane got to the command center shortly after nine fifteen. &quot;Helmsmen Jordan, what is our current heading?&quot; <br />
&quot;Captain Sully, we are headed to earth to have repairs done to the stations various problems, sir.&quot; <br />
Xane got to his desk and found the order on top of all the papers that were there. &quot;When did this order come in?&quot; &quot;About six minutes ago, sir, straight from the top.&quot; Eric said. Eric was always the first to get to the command center no matter when Xane got up. Well, I better inform the whole station about the move. &quot;Attention crew and civilians of the Zonarr, we are enroute to earth. We should be arriving at the moon base in 72 hours. If you want to see your friends and family, please do so when we get there. We will notify you when we get to the base and when it is safe to get off. Thank you and have a good day.&quot; Xane said into the station communications. &quot;Ross please come to my office.&quot; <br />
&quot;What&#39;s up captain?&quot; Eric asked. <br />
&quot;What do you know about Demitri Vaughn?&quot; <br />
&quot;Vaughn, Demitri, 26, born July 10, 4100. Top of his class in med school. No criminal record. First to volunteer in the medical wing and was denied by the general, then four months later was drafted by medical board and was shuttled over three days ago from the Cincinnati shuttle site.&quot; Eric read out loud the paperwork. <br />
&quot;Something is not right.&quot; Said Xane, &quot;Most doctors have their full license at thirty not twenty five. Eric, please double check the paperwork when we get to earth. Jordan you have the command. I&#39;m going to the gym, Eric, you can come if you want.&quot; <br />
Once out of the command center, Xane looked at Eric and was getting ready to talk when his halo communicator went off. &quot;Captain Sully, this is Dr. Vaughn, can you please stop by my office?&quot; &quot;Yea, I will be right there doctor. Eric, go ahead and I will meet you in the gym.&quot; <br />
Demitri was in his office when Xane walked in. &quot;Welcome captain, I was looking at your file and noticed that you have not had a blood reserve. I was wondering if you would like to start one done today?&quot; <br />
&quot;Me give blood? Are you trying to make me laugh? I&#39;ve given plasma before but never blood. What will my blood be used for?&quot; Xane asked. <br />
&quot;Your blood will be put in reserve in case you were to be injured and lost any large amount of blood. I will also be taking a sample of your blood for testing, which will include any form of disease. Would you like to start the reserve now?&quot; <br />
Xane thought about it for a minute. &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot; He said. <br />
&quot;Great. Now I will take you to the back and I will start your blood draw.&quot; Demitri told Xane. <br />
While walking to the back Xane&#39;s cock got stiffer and was more noticeable that last time he had walked with Demitri. Why am I so horny around Demitri?  Thought Xane. <br />
Xane and Demitri walked into the blood bank. &quot;Take a seat here. Now I am going to take a sample of you blood for testing and then I will start the draw for the reserve.&quot;  Demitri took a seventeen-gauge needle off of the table and a tourniquet. Demitri tied the tourniquet to Xane&#39;s arm. With great aim, Demitri slide the needle in Xane&#39;s arm just under the tourniquet. With Demitri just inches from Xane&#39;s crotch, Xane tried to hide his stiffy by moving his cock to one side. <br />
Why I am getting hard around Demitri? Xane thought to himself. Just ask him to Zerk&#39;s for a beer. &quot;Would you like to have a drink tonight at Zurk&#39;s bar, I mean if you want to.&quot; Xane asked. <br />
I want to have a drink with him but I don&#39;t want to sound to needy for his sexy body. &quot;I would like to have a drink tonight, but I am busy with all my paperwork.&quot; <br />
&quot;You do know that I can make that request an order right?&quot; <br />
&quot;I do believe my schedule just opened up around eight tonight.&quot; <br />
&quot;Great. Now is there enough blood in that vile?&quot; Demitri took the vile off the tube and changed to line to blood bag. Thirty minutes later Demitri walked back with a blood report and a worried look on his face, but he was trying to hide it. &quot;What&#39;s wrong doc?&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s nothing, just a report form a another patient. The patient down hall has stage two liver cancer and I have to tell him that he has cancer, I&#39;m just here to take your blood to the freezer and let you go about your life.&quot; Demitri took the need out of Xane&#39;s arm and placed a bandage on the spot of blood. Xane left to med wind and made his way to the sports floor to meet up with Eric. <br />
&quot;Hey cap, what took you? I had to have the private here spot me.&quot; <br />
&quot;The doctor had me do a blood reserve. The doctor had a patient with stage two liver cancer. I feel bad for the chap. Any ways, I&#39;m sorry that I am later.&quot; Xane spotted Eric for ten minute and then the two went to lunch at the only working restaurant in the section. After Xane ate lunch he made his way to the command center do finish the days paperwork. Xane finished the work at six thirty. Well. My work is done and I meet the doc at Zurk&#39;s shortly after eight, so what am I going to do now. Thought Xane. He got out from his desk and made his way to the captains chair in the navigation center. <br />
&quot;Helmsman Jordan, do you know the time we will arrive at the moon base?&quot; Xane asked. <br />
&quot;We should arrive at noon in two days. If the engines hold, that is, sir.&quot; Helmsman Jordan said. <br />
&quot;What are wrong with the engines now?&quot; Xane asked. <br />
&quot;The engines are at fifty percent and dropping, sir.&quot; Jordan said. <br />
Great, just one more thing to add to my list of things I have to worry about. &quot;I&#39;ll call the engineering department right away.&quot; Xane said. “Engineering, this is the captain.” Xane said. <br />
“This is Voy. How may I help captain.” Voy said. <br />
“What do you need to fix the engines to eighty percent?” Xane asked. <br />
“We would need to have most of the ships power to get it to eighty percent, but i can give you sixty-five percent for six hours with the sports deck shut down.” Voy said. <br />
Thinking for a minute. That would force Eric out of the place for the time. “Do it.” Xane said. <br />
Xane left the command center and made his way to Zerk&#39;s bar. Five floors and seven corridors later, Xane found himself in front of his favorite bar. The bartender made Xane&#39;s usual drink Fire Rock whiskey and Coke. Demitri waked into the bar around eight fifteen. <br />
&quot;Hello Captain. How are you doing tonight?&quot; Demitri asked Xane. <br />
Very drunk Xane stumbled up and answered, &quot;I&#39;m fine, just a little drunk.&quot; <br />
&quot;I can see that. How many have you had?&quot; Demitri asked. The bartender lifted up his hand with a paper, it had ten written on it. <br />
“Let’s get you to your cabin, captain.” Demitri said while lifting Xane up to his feet. <br />
“You know you are sexy.” Xane said. <br />
Demitri nodded as he took Zane to the elevator. “What deck are you on, Xane?” <br />
“I live on deck three, near the center of the ship. Door 50.” Xane slurred. <br />
Demitri helped Xane into the elevator and pressed three. The doors shut and the elevator went up. “Would you like me to stay with you?” <br />
“I would like to have you over for the night. Just don&#39;t worry about my couch, its never used.” Xane said as the elevator stopped. Demitri help Xane off and they both walked down the hall. After twenty doors later the men come up to Xanes door. <br />
“Name please.” The door said. <br />
“Captain Sully, Xane.” Xane said and the door opened. The two walked in and the door shut. Demitri sat Xane down on the couch and went to the kitchen. Demitri got a glass of water and went back to the couch to give the water to Xane. “Thank you for bringing me home you sexy thing.” <br />
“Captain. Your drunk and you do not have a sane mind.” Demitri started to say. <br />
“I have been feeling things for you since this morning and now I have you in my quarters.” Xane said grabbing Demitri’s ass. <br />
God. The captain is hot as hell, but he is drunk and I do want to take his hot body to bed. Demitri thought. “Why don’t I take you to bed sir.” <br />
“Why don’t I keep you in my bed for the night of course.” Xane said with a smile. <br />
I am not lusting him. Demitri thought. He must really be into me. “Yes you can sir.” <br />
“You can call me Xane. Its what my friends call me.” Xane said. <br />
“Ok Xane. Lets get you in the bed.” Demitri said while helping Xane up. The two made their way to Xane’s bed and Xane grabbed Demitri’s ass again. The two made it to the bed, Demitri started to take Xane’s shirt off and Xane undid Demitri’s pants. Demitri took a hand and lifted Xane’s head up to his own head and kissed Xane on the lips. Shocked at first, Xane returned the kiss and undid Demitri’s shirt and threw it to the floor. The two were naked in mere minutes and were on the bed making out for most of the night. The two stayed in the bed for the day and started to explore each other the next night. Around five the following morning a call came in. <br />
“This the captain.” Xane said. <br />
“Captain, we are approaching the moon base eight hours ahead of schedule. Its best if you come to the command center, sir.” the helmsman said. <br />
“Thank you helmsman. I will be there soon.” Xane said as he tried to untangled himself from Demitri. What the hell happened to me for the last day. He thought as he got dressed. I will leave him a note. Xane wrote a note for Demitri. Make yourself at home. Will be back in a few hours. Xane made his way out of the apartment and to the command center. <br />
“Captain on deck.” Helmsman Carrie said. <br />
“Thank you, Helmsman. How did we get here so fast?” Xane asked. <br />
“I have restored most of the engines functions and increased the ships speed by fifty percent.” Commander Voy said. <br />
“Nice work, Voy. Open all channels.” <br />
“All channels open sir.” an ensign said. <br />
“This is Captain Xane Wolffe. I am requesting permission to begin docking procedures.” Xane said. <br />
“Docking procedures granted captain. Welcome home Xane.” A female voice said on the communicator. <br />
“Hello Latisha. Its good to hear from you finally. I have to go and prep the citizens for arrival. Have a great day.” Xane walked to his chair and closed the channel and opened a channel for the ship wide broadcast. “Attention to all. We have arrived at the moon base and started docking.  Please be ready for full stop in two minutes.” Xane said. Xane left the center and made his way back to his apartment. <br />
“Welcome home Xane. What made you leave so early?” Demitri asked as Xane got in. <br />
“We are docking at moon base right now and only I can gain permission of the docking. So  I went  and dealed with it. What happened to me the other night?” Xane asked. <br />
“Well. You were drunk and horny. You and I spent most of the time getting to know one another.” Demitri said. <br />
Oh fuck. “What did I drink?” Xane asked. <br />
“The barkeep told me you had ten Fire Rock whiskey and Coke. You were very great in bed last night.” Demitri told Xane. <br />
“What did I do last night?” asked Xane. <br />
“We made out and laid next to one another for most of the time and then we suck cock for a few hours. Morning hit and we slept for the day. The bridge called me said that you did not report in, I told them that you were sleeping off a hangover and placed Eric in charge. We explored each other again the following night.” Demitri said. <br />
“Is that why I did not feel anything this morning?” Xane asked. <br />
“The reason you did not fell anything is because I gave you a great night.” Demitri said with a smile. The two walked to the living room and Demitri got dressed. “I need to tell you something Xane.” <br />
“What is it?” Xane asked. <br />
“The blood sample I took from you came back last night and it showed that you have a rare form of cancer that has no cure. Its called Kitinger. It has no cure and many who get it don&#39;t know that they have it until its too late, but because we found it now it means we can try and slow it down.” <br />
Xane’s communicator went off. “This is the captain.” <br />
“Sir, your presence is needed down in the docking bay.” Jorden said. <br />
“I’ll be right there.” He said putting his communicator away. “Doc, come with me. I think you may be needed.” The two left the apartment and worked their way to the elevator. <br />
“What’s going on, Cap?” Demitri asked. <br />
“The bridge said I was needed at docking bay for some odd reason. This fucking place is falling apart and I have to find a way to fix it all.” The two walked in the elevator and Xane pressed the botton for fifteen floors below. The elevator started to move and the two started to kiss. Xane’s tongue moving over Demitri’s teeth. “Mm. Your have some sharp teeth there.” <br />
“I’m sorry about that. My canines have always been sharp” Demitri said. He looked deep into Xanes denim blue eyes as if to trance him. “I’m not normally this blunt to say this but I love you too much to hide it from you.” <br />
“Then tell me the truth. What is it that you want to tell me?” Xane said. <br />
Demitri paused for moment. &quot;I don&#39;t want to tell you everything but I am not who you think I am. I have been around long enough to see people die for centries. I&#39;ve seen the world change. I&#39;m not human.&quot; He said. <br />
Xane thought about what Demitri said. &quot;Then what are you? A vampire?&quot; <br />
Demitri smirked as Xane finished his question. &quot;You are smarter than you act. I&#39;m old enough to be your great great great great great grandfather. I&#39;ve fought in countless wars, killed millions of people and turned my fair share of humans.&quot; <br />
Xane stepped closer to Demitri, reaching for his hand. &quot;I knew something was up when I got your paperwork the other day. But I wanted to know more and I want to let you know that I enjoyed my time with you over the last two nights and I want to stay with you forever.&quot; <br />
Demitri took a step  closer to Xane and held him in a hug. &quot;Then lets get to know one another by going out on dates and.....&quot; <br />
&quot;Then tonight we go on a date on earth and we&#39;ll talk more.&quot; The elevator stopped and opened up to the docking bay and a crate fell on the floor. &quot;Who paged me down here without moving this shit!&quot; <br />
&quot;That was me captian.&quot; A blonde woman said as she was running over to get the crate moved. The woman was built like an ox and had bright green eyes standing about five foot. <br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok ensign. I thought Boehn left it here.&quot; Xane said as he helped her pick up the crate. <br />
&quot;He did. I called you down here because I just found him. Dead.&quot; she said. <br />
&quot;Dead. How?&quot; Demitri asked. <br />
&quot;His throat was ripped out sir.&quot; The young girl said. &quot;It looks like a wolf ate him.&quot; <br />
&quot;There aren&#39;t wolves on this ship is there, Xane?&quot; Demitri asked. <br />
&quot;Ensign report to moon base and get some home time. I&#39;ll look this over with security and there are no wolves on this station doctor.&quot; Xane said as he looked over the body. Xane pulled out a communicator. &quot;Security to docking bay, bring three people from medical. Make sure to not panic the civilians. Demitri what does it look like to you?&quot; <br />
&quot;It does look like it was a wolf but not just any type of wolf.&quot; Demitri said. <br />
&quot;Like a werewolf.&quot; Xane said. <br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Demitri said. &quot;Just like a werewolf.&quot; <br />
&quot;But who would attack Boehn as a werewolf? Why not just shoot him and be done?&quot; Xane asked. <br />
&quot;I could make a request for leaches and test everyone on the ship. If you want to.&quot; Demitri said. <br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t want to scare to people on this ship.&quot; Xane said as he stood up. The two men waited for the security and medics to arrive. “Hey Demitri. When is the next full moon?”<br />
“The next full moon is next week but with us traveling past the moon the way we did,” Demitri paused. “Means that the werewolf got an extra cycle in his belt this week.”<br />
Xane flinches at the mention of a second werewolf shift in a week. “What can we do to find the werewolf other than leeches?”<br />
The two men walk back to the medical office after the body was taken to the morgue on earth. “The only way that I know is that the person that is a werewolf, the night before the full moon the the beast will give more strength and endurance. That the person would be almost uncontrollable.” Demitri looks at Xane and gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.<br />
The two take the last shuttle to earth and spend time at Xane’s family farm in Casper, Wyoming.</p>
