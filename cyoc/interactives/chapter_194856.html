<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike decided to make a plan to turn himself into a pair of panties. He spent most of the night coming up with a foolproof plan, and he got up early in the morning to make it happen.<br />
<br />
None of the plan itself was too difficult, though there were a lot of steps to it. It was a little before 6:30, way before most people were up but, then again, that was sort of the point. He left his dorm room and took the stairs up to the fourth floor. He popped out into the hallway. No one had seen him yet, a good sign. When he got to room 407, he took out the gun, turned the setting to &quot;shrink,&quot; and pointed it at himself.<br />
<br />
He spent a few seconds kneeling on the floor, a little dazed, but he thought it might be more his surprise at the effects of being shrunk more than anything that would affect him once he got used to it. There was a lot to get used to, too, as he discovered as he finally took a look around. Even in the relatively barren hallway of a college dorm, he was truly shocked. The walls went up like cathedrals, the doorknobs looked like giant statues thousands of feet high, and the smallest things he wouldn&#39;t even notice, like a tiny scrap of paper left along the side of the hallway, now looked absolutely enormous. It was terrifying for a second, but he remembered his gun, looked down at it, and breathed out. It was time to get moving.<br />
<br />
He snuck under the door, which at his current height he could do without crouching. He imagined he was maybe a quarter of an inch tall, or maybe an eighth, as he moved on into the kitchen. (Yeah, it was a nice dorm. No complaints.) His height was not that immediately important, though, as he immediately fired the gun back at himself and grew himself back to about ten inches tall as he strolled across the floor to another doorway. His friend Kristen lived behind the door, sharing the kitchen and bathroom with another girl. He’d lusted after Kristen for some time, and now he was going to get closer to her than he ever thought possible.<br />
<br />
As he crossed the kitchen, ready to shrink himself at a moment&#39;s notice if one of the girls opened her door. He didn’t hear a sound though, so once he arrived at the door to Kristen&#39;s dorm room, he shrunk himself back down to a fraction of an inch and walked under the door.<br />
<br />
Mike entered Kristen&#39;s room with wonder and amazement. He’d been to her dorm room for parties and stuff, but it had never looked like this. As he walked in, he made himself become slightly bigger to help his stride across her room. He arrived at Kristen&#39;s dresser, where he finally had a view of her bed. From the gaping distance that was her dorm room, he saw the sleeping titaness, facing away from him, rising and falling under the covers with each breath. Despite being a full room away from her and not being able to see her face, it was still an amazing sight.<br />
<br />
Still, he had work to do. He enlarged himself to about four feet tall, and very quietly opened the top drawer of her dresser. Bingo! He was concerned he&#39;d have to spent several minutes looking through her room, but he found her bras and panties on the first try. He almost completely shut the drawer, leaving just a crack that he hoped Kristen doesn&#39;t notice. He smiled as he thought about how in mere seconds that crack would be the only way he&#39;d be able to see.<br />
<br />
He looked on top of her dresser, filled with basic hygiene stuff like makeup and deodorant. Careful not to disturb anything, he climbed on top of the dresser and slowly pulled out the gun. Just then, his stomach dropped out as he heard an awful noise: Kristen turning around in bed. She&#39;s up!<br />
<br />
He fired the gun at himself, shrinking almost immediately. He was back down to half an inch tall, and he raced behind a giant stick of deodorant. Did she see him? What would he do if she recognized him? He hid behind the deodorant for a minute of silence. Eventually he got the courage to poke his head around, and he could see that Kristen had only turned over in bed. She was still asleep. God, she was hot.<br />
<br />
Back to the task at hand, he walked over to the edge of the dresser, looking down into the tiny crack where he left the top drawer pulled out. Now it looked like a canyon, and he was sure he could sneak inside. The drop was going to be enormous at his size, but he walked over to what looks like a pile of bras, and he was sure they&#39;ll break his fall. He slid over the edge, hung on for a second, and then let go.<br />
<br />
He was right about the bras, as he landed deeply in the pile but softly on his back, without even a hint of pain. Still, it was an exciting drop. From the light coming in through the crack, he slid down off the bras and jogged over to the panty half of Kristen&#39;s drawer. He couldn’t really see much in the way of her inventory, here, which had him momentarily agitated, but then he remembered the tricks of the gun, and he transformed a pair of panties into a flashlight. He was a little amazed when it worked like a charm, allowing him to take a good look around. Unfortunately, the moment he started thinking about which pair of Kristen&#39;s panties he&#39;d like to become, her alarm went off.<br />
<br />
Mike heard Kristen turn off the alarm and he panicked: he had no time left. He thanked himself for advance planning, though, and executed his plan. He saw a pair of green silk panties in front of him, chose them, and quickly ran over and dragged a few pairs of cotton panties on top of it. This way, when he transformed himself, Kristen wouldn&#39;t notice any duplicates. He took out the gun, pointed it at himself, and froze. What if this didn&#39;t work? What if it did, and he didn&#39;t even know it? How was a pair of panties going to be a sentient being? What if he was about to kill himself here? He didn&#39;t have time to think, though, as he heard pounding footsteps growing louder. Kristen was coming. He fired.<br />
<br />
He felt weird. Everything just felt flat, but in a way that was hard to describe or even to understand. At first he couldn&#39;t see anything, and he wasn’t sure whether he could hear, and he wondered what happened. Was he dead? In a minute, though, he started to make out the muffled sounds of Kristen moving about her room, and he could see the sliver of light formed by the crack in the dresser. He tried moving, and he couldn&#39;t, but he was not that surprised. He was a little worried about what will happen when he tried to change back. He certainly didn&#39;t see the gun. For now, though, he was a pair of green silk panties, and he was going to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, the ground shook beneath him and the skies were flooded with light. Kristen opened the drawer! He saw most of the upper half of her naked body, and he gazed in awe at her monstrously sized tits. Above, way in the distance, he could see her titanic face looking down right at him. This was so weird.<br />
<br />
Kristen reached down into her panty drawer.</p>
