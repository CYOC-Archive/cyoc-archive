<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan's horror over not only his transformation but also his regret over past actions had been too much for him to bear. His mother's teleportation spell had taken him to a place that could help him. What Dan didn't know was the spell also allowed Dan's mind to relax but without allow it to deteriorate further.<br />
<br />
A white voided surrounded Dan for several seconds. When it faded and Dan returned to the world, Dan found himself laying down in a field.<br />
<br />
The teleportation had left Dan's mind in a something of a dream state where he would need a few minutes to wake up and remember what had happened to him. <br />
<br />
Dan tried to stand on two legs only for his body to betray him. He fell onto all fours. <br />
<br />
His altered vocal chords censored any attempt to summon help. The loud brays he made felt natural but he also knew that it was wrong.<br />
<br />
When he stood -- on four hoofed legs, he looked around the area. He was in a field where he saw three horses milling about. The view he was getting seemed wrong. He was seeing too much and couldn't focus forward.<br />
<br />
A warm sun beat down on Dan which reminded him of his nudity.<br />
<br />
Things started coming back to him.<br />
<br />
He remembered Kat's spell, his changing and his regret over mistakes of the past leading to him feeling he deserved this. After that, there was what Dan could only describe as a draining sensation. That was his knowledge fading.<br />
<br />
Dan didn't feel anger over this, nor did he feel panic. He understood what Kat's spell had taken from him but he couldn’t bring himself to feel anger or panic. It was something that just was.<br />
<br />
The ultimate question surfaced in Dan's mind, what was he supposed to do now? What kind of life could he have as a donkey? Could he even have a life as a donkey? <br />
<br />
He'd seen farms from the car as he passed by them. Horses in the fields always seemed to be just standing there doing little. Was this to be his life from this point forward? Was he doomed to an existence as a beast, his very humanity lost? Would he be letting Kat win if he tried to enjoy this? Something seemed to keep Dan from panicking and asking further questions.<br />
<br />
With nothing else to do, Dan considered his immediate situation. He was a donkey, in a field, he had no clothes and much of his knowledge seemed hidden from him. He knew that he had forgotten things but he just couldn’t seem to allow that to bother him.<br />
<br />
Perhaps his ignorance was for the best.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was quiet and peaceful. Dull perhaps, but the tranquil environment helps to mitigate any boredom.<br />
<br />
<br />
A warm breeze blew through the field carrying with it the sweet scent of grass and hay. There were also horses (some of which were female, much to Dan's delight). The scents relaxed Dan. For a brief moment, Dan felt at peace.<br />
<br />
Dan heard something approach from behind. Something he realized he'd been smelling for some time. He turned and came face to face with a young woman whose appearance screamed farmer's daughter. She had long red hair tucked into a ponytail, overalls and even freckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome Dan,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Dan brayed at her. He knew the words she was saying. However, their meaning was foggy, as though the magic had made his mind simpler. He found it easier to focus on the tone. <br />
<br />
Even as a donkey, Dan found the young woman cute. She instilled feelings of comfort and understanding in Dan. It was as though she knew what was going on and could help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Dan, I know who you are and I'm here to help,&quot; the young woman said as she patted the side of Dan's face. <br />
<br />
She reached into a back pocket of her overalls and pulled out a carrot before offering it to Dan. Dan started munching it out of her hands as feelings of content went through him. Perhaps, he wondered, this wasn’t going to be so bad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother sent you here with a spell that also telepathically told me what I needed to know. Well, I know you probably understand me but it's just harder for you now. That's all right, just focus on the tone of my voice. You're going to be all right. My name is Marina.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan nodded and brayed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand you have regrets over mistakes you've made in the past Dan,&quot; Marina said. &quot;Thing is Dan, we've all made mistakes, it is part of...&quot;<br />
<br />
Marina patted Dan and chuckled. &quot;It's part of being human. Don't get me wrong, I'm not laughing at you. You see Dan; I was once in your position.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan brayed as he wondered what Marina was talking about. Marina turned around and showed Dan that she had a horse’s tail! It was a beautiful chestnut color and went through a small leg like protrusion from her overalls.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a long story but I like you was the victim of vengeful magic. A kind old man helped me to regain my humanity for the most part. I decided to help others that have suffered a similar fate. The horses you see used to be human. Two of them are in your position; the other has chosen to remain here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan looked in the direction of the horses.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have gained some minor abilities. One of which is giving you the ability to talk with the horses and they with you. Now, humans will not understand you but it is a start,&quot; Marina said. &quot;Dear me, I'm carrying on again. As I was saying, making mistakes is part of being human. It's what we learn from those mistakes and how we better ourselves that matters. That you feel regret over them and acknowledge you were wrong shows that you're not the monster you feel you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan brayed. Perhaps that was true. However, he still was a donkey from Kat's spell. Meaning (to him anyway) that he was a donkey at heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dan, while I cannot understand you word for word so to speak, I still have some empathy. Meaning, I can understand what you mean to say,&quot; Marina said. &quot;Donkey's are not the creatures fiction portrays them as. Perhaps you can come to realize this and accept being a donkey. It is not a crime to be a donkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan nodded and brayed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, why don't you go and meet the others? I'm sure they'd love to meet you.&quot;</p>
