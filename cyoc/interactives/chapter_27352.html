<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carrie and John went back to the room and settled in for the night.  Carrie flipped the channels on the T.V.  She couldn't bear to watch Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, so she surfed right past it.  She changed another channel as John came back into the room.  &quot;Hey, go back on channel,&quot; he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Carrie was confused by the movie.  She had never seen it before.  The animation, particularly the backgrounds were unbelievable.   &quot;What's this?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool World,&quot; John replied.<br />
<br />
The storyline of the movie nearly drove Carrie nuts.  She was intrigued by the character of Holli Would, a doodle (aka toon) who wanted to break the one law of Cool World and have sex with a noid (aka human), so she could be human too.  When Holli attacked her noid creator and turned herself human, Carrie nearly came just from rubbing her thighs together beneath the blanket.  It got even better when Holli was returned to her doodle form and when Brad Pitt's character turned into a doodle as well.<br />
<br />
As she made love to John that night, she rode on top of him just like Holli had taken Gabriel Byrne.<br />
<br />
'This could be fun!' Carrie thought, 'if I were a toon like Holli, seducing John.&quot;  She came at that thought.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, with her increased ardor, Carrie outlasted John and he soon lay next to her snoring away.  Unable to relax, Carrie got out of bed and flipped through the brochures she and John had collected that day.  She grew nervous again as she found the one from the Transform Center.  She jumped back when she opened the brochure and a caption popped out of it and grew to twelve feet across.<br />
<br />
&quot;OPEN ALL NIGHT!&quot; it read, &quot;WE NEVER CLOSE.&quot;<br />
<br />
Knowing what she need to do, Carrie got up quietly and dressed.  As she headed out the door, she thought she might give John the thrill of his life in a few hours.<br />
<br />
Carrie walked the quiet streets until she came to the Transformation Center.  True to its promise, it was open albeit rather empty.<br />
<br />
Another toon woman sat at the reception desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;How may I help you,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My husband and I just watched Cool World and ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; the woman replied as she picked up a clipboard and walked Carrie toward one of the cylinders.  &quot;Who would you like to be like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um,umm&quot; Carrie stuttered, &quot;I think her name was Holli ...umm....something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holli Would?&quot; the toon asked as she flipped a switch on the panel next to a cylinder.  An image of the Holli Would character appeared on screen next to the chamber and the front panel slip open with a hiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how long would you like this attribute?&quot;<br />
<br />
The toon waited a long, long time for Carrie's reply.  She was patient though.  Something like this happened a couple of times a month.  She knew on a personal level how momentous a decision this woman was making.  She thought of the moment she had stood in front of chamber like this such a long time ago and waited, words sticking in her throat before she whispered....<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be a toon forever,&quot; <br />
<br />
The toon woman nodded at Carrie's statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; she said as she turned several pages on her clipboard to the questions she needed to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do understand that this process is permanent and irreversible?&quot;  Carrie nodded silently.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You understand that you will cease to be human, that your human body will be converted totally into photo electric energy?&quot;  Carrie's head continued to move up and down.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You understand that once the process begins, it cannot be stopped?  As soon as you step into the that chamber and the door slides shut, you will become a toon  ... forever, and no one, not you, not me nor anyone else will be able to stop it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Carrie whispered, &quot;a toon forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; the attendant said.  She held the clipboard up and handed Carrie a pen.  &quot;Sign here,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Carrie's hands were trembling as she tried to sign her name to the document that would allow these people to change her life, her very existence.  She managed to scrawl something akin to her signature and handed the clipboard back to the representative.  Her smile warmed as she took it, and her businesslike demeanor melted away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you're making a wonderful decision.  Your just going to love being a toon,&quot; she winked at Carrie and motioned toward the chamber.<br />
<br />
Carrie walked slowly yet purposefully into the chamber.  When she reached the center, she turned around, placed her hands to her sides and nodded to the toon.  &quot;I'm ready,&quot; she said.  &quot;Do it now, make me a toon!&quot;<br />
<br />
The toon woman smiled back and tapped a few buttons on the console.  The door to the chamber began to slide shut.<br />
<br />
'This is it,' Carrie thought, 'no turning back now.'<br />
<br />
She looked down at her body.  In a few short hours, everything would be different.  Her human form of flesh and blood would be a thing of the past.  She was going to be toon!<br />
<br />
The chamber was flooded with a bright white light.  Carrie couldn't see out of it anymore. Although it didn't hurt her eyes, the light grew brighter still.  It grew to the point that Carrie couldn't even see her hand in front of her face.  Then she felt energy ripple over her body, like she was being wrapped in a blanket of electricity - no light.  Then she felt the energy begin to move inside her pervading her very essence.  Finally, in that bright, white chamber of pure energy, Carrie's world went black.<br />
<br />
The next thing Carrie realized, the light was fading from the chamber.  It took her a few seconds to get her bearings, remember where she was, what she was doing, like those first few second of consciousness after a long night's sleep.  Then it struck her.  She'd been in a transformation chamber, becoming a toon.<br />
<br />
By now the light had faded completely. Carrie stood in the chamber.  She took a deep breath, but it seemed to be more for effect.  While air filled her body, it wasn't something she needed.  Her existence was different now.<br />
<br />
Carrie looked down.  Against the backdrop of a 'real' room, Carrie got a glimpse of her body.  Its vibrant, unnatural color stood out.  She was wearing white, thigh high boots with high heels.  They matched her white, strapless minidress that barely contained her buxom figure.  As she ran her hands across her voluptuous body, she felt the energy that she was ripple with excitement.  She tousled her long, platinum blond hair and looked at her reflection in the glass wall of the chamber.  Her face was a cross between the one she had had, before, and that of the character, Holli Would.  Her eyes were a bright, bright blue and her bee sting lips were full, pouty and a luscious shade of red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this is incredible,&quot; Carrie exclaimed as she stepped out of the chamber.  &quot;It's really true.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a TOON!&quot;</p>
