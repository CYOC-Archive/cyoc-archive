<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was very confused when Taylor didn&#39;t easily reciprocate my advances and wouldn&#39;t let me take off his briefs. Instead, he used one hand to keep my head at arm&#39;s length and the other to hold his underwear up despite my protests.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, stop,&quot; he ordered, forcing me to back off. I was disappointed, but I mainly began to feel worried. Why didn&#39;t he want me? Did I do something wrong?<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, don&#39;t give me that look, I&#39;m doing this for both of us. You can&#39;t tell me you aren&#39;t seeing anything odd with what you were about to do,&quot; he stated.<br />
<br />
I reflected on what I was about to do. I wanted to suck him off so that I could get another load of that delicious cum. Honestly, I didn&#39;t get enough from Jacob and Chase, and I was thirsty.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... thirsty,&quot; I defended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ever heard of water?&quot; he asked. I had heard of it, I just wanted something tastier. <br />
<br />
Although, now that he forced to me think about it, something did seem off. It was hard to pinpoint exactly what was going on though. My head just felt so foggy. It felt like every time I tried to get closer to the truth, I got lost in the fog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything around us is changing here,&quot; Taylor continued. &quot;We&#39;ve both lost all our body hair and you were just working out naked with some stranger--&quot;<br />
<br />
I cut him off. &quot;That wasn&#39;t a stranger. It was Ryan, he&#39;s a police officer here.&quot;<br />
<br />
In response, Taylor looked at me like I had two heads. Then, he shook his head and continued. &quot;Not the point! Jacob&#39;s acting dumber by the second, and Chase seems to hate everything except for cock and ass. Male ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Was there something wrong with that? If Chase hated cock and ass, I felt like that&#39;d be the bigger problem.<br />
<br />
Although, I could&#39;ve sworn that I&#39;d felt differently yesterday. Was something wrong? I could feel Taylor&#39;s words beginning to pierce the fog.<br />
<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t even get me started on Daniel,&quot; Taylor continued. &quot;But the fag was practically having sex with someone in the fucking lounge. They were basically dry humping and fingering each other. And I was the only one who cared!&quot;<br />
<br />
I began piecing together everything Taylor was saying. It was slow and hard, but he was beginning to make sense. But that would mean... &quot;We&#39;re... changing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Thank you! Finally, someone who isn&#39;t completely crazy!&quot; Taylor yelled, looking relieved.<br />
<br />
The fog was beginning to clear. I remembered why I&#39;d even gone into Jacob&#39;s room. &quot;The virus. The virus is changing us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I think so, too,&quot; Taylor agreed. &quot;I just don&#39;t know what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought back on all the events that had occurred since we came to this dorm. My memories seemed jumbled, but I could make some things out. &quot;Well, I already tried escaping. That&#39;s how I got this &#39;workout&#39; session.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor was silent at that comment. He seemed legitimately angry about what he had seen between Ryan and me. I decided to move on. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s try thinking about what we know has changed. Maybe we can see if there&#39;s a way to reverse it or help people think more clearly,&quot; I suggested.<br />
<br />
Taylor nodded. &quot;Okay, so we know that our body hair is gone and I got about two inches shorter this morning. I&#39;m under six feet now. I also think my lips might have gotten a bit bigger. Plus, um, let&#39;s just say I&#39;m more curious about the male body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I haven&#39;t gotten shorter, but the rest definitely happened to me. Plus, my ass got bigger and my facial features changed a bit. I must&#39;ve gotten a bit weaker, too,&quot; I concurred. Something was bothering me though. &quot;Were... Were we always so horny though? I feel like I&#39;ve made a lot of cum in the last couple of days. Oh, and what about cum? Did we always like that so much? I&#39;m still thirsty for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; Taylor responded. &quot;Maybe we weren&#39;t as thirsty for it before, but I definitely remember liking the taste of cum a lot,&quot; he reasoned. I had to agree. I couldn&#39;t remember a time when I didn&#39;t like cum, even if I&#39;d only started having it a couple of years ago. &quot;And we are definitely just as horny as before. I know you and Lisa sexiled me practically every night for the last two weeks before we came here. And I know you two were going at it before that, so of course you&#39;d be even hornier without her here.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made sense, though part of me was a little scared that this was the first time I had thought of Lisa all day, and I hadn&#39;t even brought her up. There was something else though.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the itch?&quot; I asked. That nagging feeling had been in either my throat or my ass all day and I couldn&#39;t figure out why.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that. I don&#39;t know what it is, but it feels like it&#39;s gotten worse over the course of the day,&quot; Taylor noted. &quot;I mean, I can understand a sore throat, but a sore ass? How would we have gotten that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, there&#39;s no way I could&#39;ve gotten that. Haven&#39;t even gotten fucked yet,&quot; I stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet, anyways,&quot; Taylor replied. I should&#39;ve been taken aback by his statement, but instead, I found it kinda funny. I couldn&#39;t help myself and I let out a soft giggle. In response, Taylor giggled, as well. I was glad to know that we could still laugh with each other. At the very least, that hadn&#39;t changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so at the very least we know what to look out for. When I tried getting others to see reason, it backfired badly, so I think the only thing we can do for now is figure out a plan to get the hell out of here. This &#39;quarantine&#39; isn&#39;t doing what it&#39;s supposed to. Tomorrow, we try to find an exit. Then, we figure out how to get help and reverse our changes. Sound good?&quot; Taylor explained.<br />
<br />
I nodded, glad that I had at least one person to help me out with this. I was going to see if we could start coming up with ideas right then and there, but before I could, I heard a knock at our door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Food&#39;s here,&quot; a staff member called. I opened the door to find a man dressed only in an apron with two packaged trays in his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; I replied, before taking the trays and closing the door. I brought the food in and set it on our desks. &quot;Hey Taylor, would you mind seasoning this for me. I&#39;ll do yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, no problem,&quot; Taylor agreed nonchalantly. He quickly stripped off his briefs, unwrapped my food, and began jacking off on it. I began doing the same. It felt good having this one semblance of normalcy left in our lives. It was a little awkward when I realized that had a little trouble cumming on my own, but once I&#39;d explained to Taylor what had happened in the shower in the morning, he was quite sympathetic and jacked me off to conclusion. It felt great having an extra set of hands on me, and he didn&#39;t even have a problem fingering my ass when I mentioned the soap bar had helped. He was such a great friend.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, we&#39;d both cum on each other&#39;s meals and dug in. Dinner went by quite smoothly. The hot dogs tasted so much better with Taylor&#39;s cum on them. My mouth practically exploded with flavor, although my head felt a little more dizzy with every drop of cum. Not a bad kind of dizzy, though. It was more of a fog really.<br />
<br />
We started out kind of quiet, but soon enough we were back to our old selves, joking and having fun. We compared notes about the day&#39;s events to see what had changed. Apparently, after I&#39;d left Jacob and Chase&#39;s room, Taylor had gone in and took over where I&#39;d left off. They&#39;d had a three-way 69, and apparently Chase&#39;s mouth was amazing. I noted that I&#39;d try it the next time I visited. We both giggled at the thought.<br />
<br />
After dinner, we washed down our food with some water, but realized how much better it would be to wash it down with cum, too. I started out first, kneeling in front of him and jacking him off to completion in no time. It especially helped when I gave his tip a light kiss when he said he was close. It made him wild and he produced more than enough cum to satisfy me for a little. When we switched and Taylor began giving me a handjob, he returned the favor by using his other hand to tease my asshole and began kissing my balls. I couldn&#39;t understand why I thought giving each other handjobs were so weird yesterday. They were great!<br />
<br />
After, I&#39;d finished (and Taylor looked great after I did) we decided that it would be best to call it an early night and began getting ready for bed. Right before I was about to turn off the lights, however, I noticed that some of my cum had gotten on Taylor&#39;s nipple and he hadn&#39;t noticed yet. Without thinking, I quickly pounced and took a long lick of his nipple, gathering up all the leftover cum. It felt a little weird licking another man&#39;s nipple, but honestly I kinda liked the taste.<br />
<br />
Taylor was originally weirded out by what I had done until he&#39;d realized I was savoring the taste of the extra cum in my mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Slut,&quot; he stated. He was clearly slightly annoyed about having lost out on the extra juice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya snooze, ya lose,&quot; I replied. &quot;Unless you wanna lick it off my lips.&quot;<br />
<br />
I winked at him and shut off the lights before tucking myself in for bed. Just as I was about to doze off, I could&#39;ve sworn that I felt something warm and wet graze my lips. A part of me felt like I should&#39;ve cared, but honestly, I felt so content that all I was able to do was drift away into a peaceful slumber.</p>
