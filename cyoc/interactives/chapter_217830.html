<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff and Ema tried adjusting to their new body, but aside from their inner thoughts, it turned out that moving was harder than it seemed. Neither had full control over the entire body, and what they did have access to wasn&#39;t helpful. Mostly due to the timing required to do most things couldn&#39;t be done with just one half of the body parts needed in sync. And since they couldn&#39;t subconsciously know who was moving and how, they couldn&#39;t nail down the timings and just awkwardly stumbled, crawled, and rolled about the room, incapable of taking even a single decent step forwards. <br />
<br />
After a few attempts, they realized that it just wasn&#39;t going to work out like this, and decoded to modify their style of conjoinment. It took some time to make it back over to the Chronivac, but once they were there, it wasn&#39;t hard to change themselves.<br />
<br />
Ema took control over the keyboard and just told Jeff how to move the mouse, as she had already thought up an idea for a better form for them anyways. She typed in the specifics, this time making specifically sure to check the box that ensured that their movements and speech were completely in sync by merging their subconsciouses together. They would be 2 unique minds, but would also share a thinking space and use the same subconscious, kind of like a looser version of a hivemind. <br />
<br />
When Ema finished entering in their new design, Jeff quickly added in 2 things before he clicked enter. Ema didn&#39;t have time to read them and was curious about what he just added. But before she could ask, she began to feel like her face was being pulled to the side. Jeff felt the same as their heads seperated from each other. However, unlike before they merged, their heads were still the same identical appearance. Each head still had a mix of black and platinum blonde hair, though with most of their hair being colored platinum blonde now. Their eyebrows stayed black, which complimented their still two different colored sets of eyes. <br />
<br />
The &quot;de-merging&quot; moved down their body, pulling apart their arms, chest, and shoulders, all the way down to their bellybutton, then stopped just a few inches above their pussy. Jeff and Eva now had a shared body from just below their bellybuttons, with everything above now being split into two identical upper bodies and heads. Both torsos were still 100% female, and had everything they had when merged, including breasts. <br />
<br />
Jeff, now their right half, fondled her breasts with both of her feminine hands while Ema, now their left half, inspected their point of conjoinment, finding it interesting that she could feel Jeff bringing them both a decent amount of pleasure from her fondling. It was like she was being made to feel aroused, despite not doing anything to her side. Even her untouched nipples were hard as diamonds.<br />
<br />
Both halves then simultaneously let out the same exact moan, as Jeff&#39;s finger work picked up speed, as she moved one of her hands down towards their pussy. Ema on the other hand, did nothing, letting herself just be taken along for the ride, as Jeff slipped one of her fingers inside of their pussy. To Ema, it felt as if she was fingering herself, and if she were being fingered by someone else at the same time. <br />
<br />
After a minute more, Ema and Jeff both moaned once more and fell back onto the bed as they came. Jeff felt her legs spread apart, but couldn&#39;t tell if she did it, or if it was Ema who moved them, as anything below their individual halves was shared in full. Ema also didn&#39;t know who moved them either, but also knew that she would have done this anyways, so didn&#39;t mind that it happened and just added a finger of her own to their pussy. <br />
<br />
As she closed her eyes, she still found that despite not being able to see, she somehow knew what was going on inside the room. It was only when Jeff also closed her eyes, did access to that information feed finally stop. They continued to lay their on their backs in the afterglow, as their pleasure slowly began to dissipate.<br />
<br />
But then Ema felt an itch on her chest. Jeff felt it too, and both opened their eyes at the same time, then mirrored the other&#39;s movements as they looked down at their own cleavage, then at the other&#39;s as a dark spot began to form between their breasts. The only difference between them was the smile on Jeff&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Ema watched as the dark spot gained a bump, then began to inflate before her eyes. She could feel it happening to her own chest as well. The two of them watched in silence as a third boob grew into existance, right between their two normal ones. Ema knew this was part of what Jeff added in last minute and rolled her eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really? A third tit? Because having four of them wasn&#39;t enough already?&quot; Asked Ema with a chuckle. She wasn&#39;t against this addition in the slightest, though was a little disappointed in herself that she didn&#39;t think to do this from the start. <br />
<br />
Their legs moved and stood up, with neither of the knowing which one was in control over their lower half. &quot;Did you move our legs, or did I do that?&quot; Asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know either. I mean, I think it was me, but I also don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, maybe it&#39;s because we both wanted to move them?&quot; Suggested Jeff, but Ema had a better theory. <br />
<br />
&quot;Or maybe they are being controlled by our shared subconscious? Which would explain how coordinated they are too. I mean, we both have control over them it seems. Here, I will raise our left leg.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded and raised her left leg, then understood. &quot;Oh!! I raised the left leg. Or, we raised our left leg I guess. If one of us wants to do it, then maybe both of us want to it seems. That makes things so much easier! It feels as if I am in full control, but really we are just perfectly synced up from below the waists.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice. Oh, I just thought of something. Since I am conjoined with you, and am now a girl too, am I now like, your twin sister or what?&quot; Asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh... maybe? But also maybe not? It&#39;s hard to say. Like I know we are not actually blood related, but we also now share a body, so we kinda are now, logically speaking. I guess it depends on how the world sees us. Why? Is there something on your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... a bit. Since I am a girl now, shouldn&#39;t I have like, a girl name too? Jeff isn&#39;t exactly the peek of femininity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True... How about Mira? You know, since it&#39;s kind of like I am looking into a mirror when I look at you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mira... Mira... Mira... yeah, I like it&quot; accepted Jeff, now Mira. Ema then kissed Mira and then remembered something. &quot;Hey, you added two thing. The first was obviously our extra tits. So what&#39;s the second one supposed to be, or has it not happened yet?&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>
What is Mira&#39;s second change that she has in store for them?</h3>
