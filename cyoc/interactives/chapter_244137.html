<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her jeans felt tight, uncomfortably tight. Jen looked down, noticing a peculiar bulge. &quot;What the fuck?&quot; she murmured, unbuttoning her pants. A tentative touch to the fabric revealed an unmistakable bulge. &quot;Is this a fucking joke?&quot; she said to herself, though the gravity of the situation was setting in. The bulge grew firmer, more pronounced, pushing against her hand.<br />
<br />
Her heart racing, Jen pulled down her zipper, and a cock slithered out, thick and veiny. She stared in horror, her eyes widening in disbelief. &quot;Oh, Jesus!&quot; It was massive, easily six inches long, and it was still growing. Thick as her wrist and as hard as a steel rod, it pointed straight at the ceiling. Her pants fell to the floor, a useless garment around her ankles.<br />
<br />
Jen stumbled back onto her bed, the mattress sinking under her weight. She couldn&#39;t take her eyes off her new appendage. It grew, inch by inch, the skin stretching tightly over the swelling shaft. It was a monstrous thing, a caricature of masculinity that didn&#39;t belong on a human body, let alone hers. Her mind raced, trying to comprehend what was happening. This couldn&#39;t be real. But the sensations were all too real, the heat and the pulse of blood filling the engorged flesh, the heavy weight of it resting against her thigh.<br />
<br />
The cock grew, now a formidable two feet in length, thick as a baseball bat. It was a grotesque parody of arousal, a throbbing, veiny monument to maleness that filled her with a mix of fear and a strange, unwelcome thrill. She reached out tentatively, her fingertips grazing the velvety skin. Despite the horror, it felt good—too good. Her body seemed to respond involuntarily, her nipples hardening and her breath quickening. She hated it. Hated how it made her feel, hated the alien sensation of desire that seemed to be taking root within her.<br />
<br />
Her pussy, now a cavernous opening, began to spurt juices, the musky scent of arousal permeating the room. She watched in horror as her labia retreated, the inner folds swelling and coalescing into a single mass that began to reshape itself. The transformation was mesmerizing, the skin thickening and darkening, sprouting coarse hair that grew faster than weeds in springtime. Her clit retreated, enveloped by the rapidly growing tissue that now formed a hairy scrotum, the size of a watermelon, heavy with the beginnings of something monstrous.<br />
<br />
The transformation of her genitals was a grotesque spectacle, the flesh stretching and morphing into an anatomy she had never seen before. The sensations grew more intense as the new form took shape. Her body quivered with an alien need, her mind struggling to reconcile with the changes. The scrotum grew taut, and within it, two spheres began to form, swelling to the size of basketballs, the weight of them pulling the skin taut.<br />
<br />
Jen couldn&#39;t help but feel a perverse fascination with the monstrous organ between her legs. It was thick, easily the size of her forearm, and the veins bulged like rivers under the surface. Her hand trembled as she reached down to touch it again, her fingertips tracing the length of the shaft. Despite her revulsion, she found it impossible to resist the urge to explore, to feel the power and heat of it. Her touch sent a shockwave of pleasure through her body, and she realized with a mix of terror and arousal that she was getting turned on.<br />
<br />
The cock grew even larger, stretching to a staggering four feet in length. It was like nothing she had ever seen before, a grotesque exaggeration of male genitalia. She watched in the mirror as the glans swelled, a dark purple that threatened to split the skin. Her hand looked so tiny in comparison, and yet, she couldn&#39;t stop herself from touching it. The sensation was overwhelming, a mix of pain and pleasure that was driving her mad with desire.<br />
<br />
Her fingertips danced along the shaft, feeling the pulse of blood beneath the skin. It was thick, like a tree trunk, the girth of it nearly as wide as her thigh. She wrapped her hand around it, her fingers barely able to touch her thumb. It felt hot, alive, and the feeling of power it exuded was intoxicating. The hair grew denser, forming a thick pelt around the base, merging with the fur that now covered her crotch.<br />
<br />
The tip grew larger, swelling like a balloon about to pop, until it was the size of a cantaloupe. The veins grew more pronounced, like cords of rope standing out against the dark skin. The cock now towered over her, six feet of pure, unadulterated maleness. She hated it, but she couldn&#39;t deny the strange thrill that shot through her as she stroked it. The sensation was unlike anything she had ever felt, and her body responded in ways she never thought possible.<br />
<br />
Her hand slid up and down the shaft, the thickness of it making it almost impossible to grip fully. It was like a python, heavy and unyielding. Her movements grew more urgent, her strokes more deliberate. The fur that surrounded it was coarse and prickly, tickling her thighs as she worked herself into a frenzy. The pleasure built, a crescendo of sensations that she couldn&#39;t ignore.<br />
<br />
With a sudden surge of strength born from desperation, Jen thrust her hips upward, impaling the air with her newfound phallus. The bed frame groaned in protest, the mattress squeaking in a symphony of despair. She didn&#39;t notice at first, too lost in the overwhelming sensations consuming her. But then, with a loud crack, the frame gave way. The headboard slammed into the wall, leaving a gaping hole in the plaster. The mattress tipped precariously, the box spring now exposed.<br />
<br />
The cock, unbothered by the chaos, remained erect. Jen looked down at it, panting. It was like watching a creature from a nightmare, a part of her yet entirely separate. She reached out tentatively, her hand hovering above the shaft. The tip of her finger brushed against the sensitive skin, and she gasped. It felt like a live wire, sending jolts of electricity through her body.<br />
<br />
To her astonishment, she found that she could move it with surprising ease. She swung it around in an arc, the weight of it giving the illusion of a pendulum. The motion was fluid, almost graceful. It was as if her body had been rewired to accommodate this monstrous appendage. Her movements grew bolder, more experimental. She swung it up and over her head, the length of it looping around her torso like a python.<br />
<br />
Jen felt a tear form at the conner of her eye, she goes to wipe her eye but finds her cock moving to do so instead. The sensation was eerie, but also strangely liberating. She could feel every muscle, every nerve, every vein, as if it were an extension of her own body. She swiped the tear away with the tip of her cock, and watched in amazement as the salty fluid clung to the fur before dropping to the floor.<br />
<br />
Her door creaked open, and she heard a gasp. She looked over to see her mom standing in the doorway, eyes wide in shock and fear. &quot;Mom?&quot; Jen managed to croak out, her voice deeper, more guttural than it had ever been.<br />
<br />
Instead of fleeing in horror, her mother took a tentative step forward, her gaze flickering from Jen&#39;s face to the monstrous appendage that lay on the bed beside her. &quot;What... what is happening to you?&quot; she whispered, her voice trembling.<br />
<br />
Jen felt a surge of embarrassment, but also a strange comfort in her mother&#39;s presence. She had never been one to shy away from the unexplained, and here she was, staring down the barrel of a transformation that would have sent most people running. &quot;It&#39;s the curse,&quot; Jen murmured, her hand still wrapped around the base of her new organ. &quot;The Transform or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mom&#39;s eyes narrowed, understanding dawning in them. &quot;But... why are you...?&quot; she trailed off, gesturing to the monstrous cock.<br />
<br />
Jen took a deep breath. &quot;It&#39;s part of the curse. It&#39;s turning me into a male anthro, and I can&#39;t stop it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother&#39;s expression shifted from horror to curiosity. &quot;A... a male anthro?&quot; she repeated, her gaze still glued to the monstrous member.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom&#39;s time&#39;s almost up, you need to make your choice,&quot; Jen said, her voice now a low rumble that seemed to resonate through the very walls of the room.<br />
<br />
Her mom&#39;s eyes snapped back to hers, and for a moment, Jen thought she saw a flicker of something other than fear. It was almost... excitement. &quot;Dare,&quot; she said, a whisper that seemed to echo in the silence.<br />
<br />
Jen felt a strange mix of defiance and vulnerability swell within her. She knew what this meant—what she had to do. She reached out with her new cock, the furry tip brushing against her mother&#39;s outstretched hand. &quot;Dare you to touch it,&quot; she said, her voice a gruff challenge.<br />
<br />
Her mother&#39;s hand hovered for a second, then with a tremble, she made contact. Her eyes widened in surprise and fascination as she felt the warmth and vitality of the creature&#39;s flesh. It was like nothing she had ever felt before—alien, yet strangely familiar. The fur was coarse under her fingers, the shaft pulsing with an undeniable power. Jen watched as her mother&#39;s expression changed from horror to something more primal, more curious.<br />
<br />
With a gentle touch, she began to stroke the massive cock, her hand moving up and down with a slow, deliberate motion. Jen felt her body respond, muscles tensing and releasing in rhythm with her mother&#39;s touch. It was a surreal, twisted moment of bonding, one that neither of them could have ever imagined. Her mother&#39;s hand was soft, yet firm, her touch surprisingly skilled despite her lack of experience with such a form.<br />
<br />
Jen watched as her mother&#39;s face contorted with awe and concern. &quot;Does it... does it hurt?&quot; she asked, her voice shaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jen replied, her voice now a deep, rumbling bass that seemed to echo through the room. &quot;It feels... different. Good, in a weird way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother nodded, her eyes never leaving the shaft. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hand. &quot;Let&#39;s... let&#39;s get you some help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded, feeling a strange mix of relief and excitement. Her mother&#39;s acceptance was the first step in what would undoubtedly be a long, painful journey. Together, they stumbled out of the room, the massive cock swinging between Jen&#39;s legs with every step. Her mom held onto her arm, supporting her as they made their way downstairs. The house felt eerily quiet, the only sounds the thump of her heart in her chest and the swish of the fur brushing against her thighs.<br />
<br />
They reached the living room, and Jen collapsed onto the couch, the weight of her new appendage suddenly feeling overwhelming. Her mom sat beside her, her hand still wrapped around the base of the cock. &quot;What do we do?&quot; she asked, her voice trembling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Jen replied, her eyes glazed over with fear and arousal. &quot;But I think we should keep this hidden. If anyone finds out...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother nodded, her gaze still on the cock. &quot;We&#39;ll figure it out, honey,&quot; she said, her voice firm. &quot;We&#39;ll get through this.&quot;<br />
<br />
In that moment, Jen felt a strange sense of peace wash over her. Despite the horror of the situation, she had her mother&#39;s support. They sat in silence for a while, the only sound the occasional twitch of the cock as it lay across Jen&#39;s lap. The fur was warm and soft, the smell of musk growing stronger with every passing minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; her mom said finally, her hand still stroking the shaft. &quot;I&#39;m here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen leaned into the touch, the alien sensation of comfort from her mother&#39;s hand on her cock. It was a bizarre, twisted intimacy, but it was all she had. They sat like that for what felt like hours, the tension in the room thick enough to cut with a knife. The TV flickered in the background, the mundane chatter of a talk show a stark contrast to the monstrosity between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; Jen whispered, her voice hoarse.<br />
<br />
Her mom squeezed her arm gently. &quot;I don&#39;t know, but we&#39;ll face it together.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, they both knew that their relationship had changed forever. The bond between them had been twisted and reshaped into something new, something that neither of them could have ever predicted. But in the face of the unspeakable, they had found a strange form of closeness, a unity that would be tested in the days to come as Jen&#39;s transformation continued to unfold.</p>
