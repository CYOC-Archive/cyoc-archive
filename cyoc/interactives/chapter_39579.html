<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wendy and Bobby watched on as the former couple in the house lost all pleasures of sex.  In the house, both Dona and Tray were sitting on the sofa, watching television together.  Dona was still upset at the fact that she was rubbing Tray’s privates while Tray was enjoying himself.  Soon after that incident, Tray covered his privates up and zipped his pants to close it.  He then turned on the tube to watch TV and tried to forget about what just happened.  He apologize to Dona a couple of times of what happened.  But Dona wouldn’t listen; instead she waited for Tray’s mom and dad to come and told them what happened.  But she didn’t know that there was no mom or dad for both of them at all.  They didn’t know that their parents were in nursing homes or dead, nor did they know that they own the house they’re in right now.  They were too young to notice they were completely home alone.  As the two watch television, another stage of regression took place.<br />
<br />
Dona went back from twelve all the way to nine while Tray was down from seventeen to fourteen.  Their heights latterly went down like a fast moving elevator.  Now Dona was over three feet and Tray was four and a half feet.  At the same time, their bodies loose most of their mature status.<br />
<br />
For Dona, her body lost all of its preteen status.  The remaining breasts she had left faded into nothingness, leaving nothing but a flat chest and dotted nipples.  Her training bra that she had on disappeared underneath her shirt, since she doesn’t have the developing boobs needed to contain them.  Her hips and waist were loosing the remaining curves she had left, leaving nothing but a boyish shape.  Her arms and legs shorten up and gotten completely skinny with no sign of any feminine muscles what so ever.  What was left were thin arms and legs with knobby knees and elbows.  Her fingers shortened up a bit as her nails returned before she started biting them and was looking a tad boyish.  Her skin tone got lighter, making it now a pinkish color.  When she lost all of her womanly figure, something strange happened.  For one thing, she was beginning to gain a little weight as fat protruding out a little bit.  It was obvious that she was once fat when she was a little kid, but she slowly lost it when she was approaching her teens.  Now she was reliving her childhood years as the weight slowly returned.<br />
<br />
What was happening to Dona’s body is happening to her face as well.  Her structure was round and cute with puffy cheeks and a small-undeveloped nose.  Her lips were flat and unnoticeable as the lipstick in her teen years faded away leaving her with no makeup what so ever.  Inside her mouth, her second premolars, first premolars, and canine teeth from top to bottom began to loosen up and came out of her gums then slowly vanishing in a thin layer of smoke.  At the same time, the baby versions of her second molars, first molars, and canine molars slowly grew out of her gums.  Dona would’ve felt her teeth being changed but she didn’t as her youthening made her feel completely comfortable.  Freckles continued to spread everywhere as they slowly invaded her cheeks.  Her hair then started to grow down to her neck, but remained short and child like as usual.<br />
<br />
Once her body stopped changing, Dona’s clothes started to shift itself to match her new age.  Her Catholic schoolgirl uniform remained the same when she went down her first year as a freshman, but the moment she got younger, it literally changes.  First her uniform shirt lost its tie as the collar shrank and was not noticeable.  Then the color went from white to a bright pink color while characters of Disney princesses appeared on the front followed by the words, ‘Princess’ underneath.  Her skirt started to close up around the legs and got less raffled at the bottom.  The plaid color lost its design and lightens to a lightish beige color.  The hem of her now shorts shrunk back up to just below the knees, making them look like regular childlike shorts.  Underneath her shorts, the cotton underwear remained the same, but the color changed to pink as well with Belle on the front.  Her socks grew down and were nothing but short versions of themselves.  Lastly her Mary Janes were changing shape as the color brighter until they were white with a thin pink line around it.  The bottom soles went from hard to rubber while laces appeared and tied themselves up.  To top it all off, the back of her now sneakers showed Belle with another ‘Princess’ below it.  In a matter of minutes, Dona went from being a preteen catholic girl to a mere child in grade school.<br />
<br />
Tray was joining Dona soon enough as his body retreated through his teen years.  Once he loses more of his height, his muscle size dwindled down to the point where he was a gawky preteen boy.  His body hair vanished completely leaving smooth and soft skin.  The only hair he had left was both the hair on his head and around his privates.  But his privates were thin whispy as the remaining hair slowly shrinks into his skin.  His face continued to get more childlike with round cheeks, a bloated nose, and innocent eyes.  Back in his mouth, his second molars of his teeth receded back to his gums and vanished completely.  His hair got a little messy, but remained short the whole time.<br />
<br />
His clothes changed along the way.  His blue shirt brightens once more, this time the color was red.  At the same time, a Power Rangers logo appeared on the front.  His blue jeans remained the same, but the bottom hem risen up to below the knees, making them now blue jean shorts.  His sneakers remained the same, but grew smaller to match his new foot size.  Another thing that happened was a pair of glasses appeared over his eyes.  This was evident because his vision was too blurry for him in a far away angle.  So he had to wear glasses when he was six, then contact lenses when he was fifteen.<br />
<br />
Again, once their bodies and clothes started to change, their minds were the next to go.  So far all known education and memories from their teen years evaporated in a cloud of smoke.  Soon enough, Dona now had the education of grade school while Tray’s education was down to junior high.  Another thing that changed were their relationships.  Once they were husbands and wife, then boyfriend and girlfriend, then just plain crushes.  Once they went down to their younger years, they have become just friends.  In fact, the incident that they had just minutes ago acted like it didn’t really happen.  Tray changed the channel to Cartoon Network to see if there was something exciting on while Dona look at him and smiled.  “You know, I’m so glad you’re here to baby sit me Tray.” She said, sounding a whole lot more childish then usual, “I didn’t want mom to bring Ms. Waller here.  She’s always such a party pooper.”  Tray turned his head to see his best friend and said, “Don’t mention it squirt.  I’m just here to get earn my allowance.  Have to get the money for the new video game I found at Toys R Us.”  The two looked back at the TV and watch Ed, Edd, and Eddy going about their usual mischief.<br />
<br />
Out of the house, Bobby and Wendy kept observing the two to see what they would expect.  So far, they were pretty impress at the fact that they have become the closest of friends.  “Huh, that was interesting.” Wendy said with a curious expression, “Who would’ve thought they would go down as kids.  And to top it all off, that the boy would be babysitting her.”  Bobby smirked to himself and chuckled at the thought.  “Don’t worry,” he assured his lover, “before the night it over, Tray would be really babysitting her soon enough.”  So the two remained behind the bushes and waited to see what would happen next.</p>
