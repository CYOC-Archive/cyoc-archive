<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Come on son, everyone’s extra excited to have you attend! You’re quite the prize, and bets for who you’re going to end up as are proof of that.”<br />
<br />
Dylan’s father Clyde loved taking his son to the family cabin for their swapping tradition.  However, this particular year he had to practically beg his son to attend.  <br />
<br />
“Dad, you know I love your family but they’re not excited to see me, they’re excited to see what’s gonna happen TO me.  I’m just a big hunk of meat to all the adults.”<br />
<br />
“You know that’s not true.  No matter who you get I bet cousin Arthur is going to be eager to talk football with you no matter what body you’re in.  Besides, your cousins would’ve missed you.”<br />
<br />
“More like missed the opportunity to be me.“ <br />
<br />
“Dylan, you know this tradition isn’t mean spirited or meant to humiliate and demean anyone.  Everyone’s bodies are fair game and at the end of the day it’s a bonding tradition.  I know we’ve gotten a little ‘eccentric’ over the years but it’s all in good fun.”<br />
<br />
“I guess I just overthinking then.” Dylan rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“You know, I was also really possessive of my body too at your age.  The cabin is a really humbling experience.  You know everyone gets their odd swaps here and there, you might be a bit of catch but that doesn’t change the fact that we’re all going to be out of our comfort zones.  Remember the time I got Aunt Gertrude?”<br />
<br />
Dylan choked back a laugh.  “That was pretty funny.”<br />
<br />
“Exactly.  I also remember that time you got to swap with cousin Trent when you were little.  He had just got his braces taken off. You were so happy to be 16.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, ok dad I get it!” Dylan smiled. “I’ll try to lighten up.” <br />
<br />
“I’m glad to hear it!” <br />
<br />
“On last thing.  You didn’t make bets on who I would turn into, Right dad?”<br />
<br />
“Well...”<br />
<br />
Dylan let out a playful laugh.  “I swear dad you’ll always be the same no matter how many times you swap.”<br />
<br />
Dylan and his father soon arrived at the cabin.  Some family member helped them unpack.  They turned in their wrapped presents with a piece of their clothing and went to the family gathering.<br />
<br />
“Dad look, there’s Arthur and his boyfriend.  I’m gonna go say hi.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, here comes Uncle Frank.”<br />
<br />
Dylan groaned.  He loved Uncle Frank but the guy never knew when to stop talking.  <br />
<br />
“Dylan my boy!” The burly man bulled his nephew in for a great big bear hug.<br />
<br />
“I really wish you were at the adult table this year.  What I would give to for some time in that body of yours!” <br />
<br />
“Uh Thanks I’m flattered.” Dylan did his best to maintain his uneasy smile.  He genuinely didn’t want to be rude.<br />
<br />
“Enough about swapping for now though. We’ll have plenty to talk about that later.  So, how’s school going?”<br />
<br />
“Really good actually!”  Dylan lit up at the subject change.  “I’m just getting things ready to move this summer.”<br />
<br />
“That’s good to hear.  I just hope you won’t lose touch with the family when you’re away.”<br />
<br />
After a long conversation about sports and finally leaving the house.  A man began to speak to the crowd. <br />
<br />
“Alright everyone, please move to your respective age appropriate tables.”<br />
<br />
“Great talking with you again sport.” Uncle Frank gave his nephew a firm handshake and sent him on his way, but not without one last big slap on his ass.  “Hate to see him go but love to watch him leave, ay Clyde?”<br />
<br />
“Hands to yourself Frank.  If you get my son’s body next year you can grope him all you want.”<br />
<br />
Dylan made his way to the kids table.  There were name plates on every seat, and his way allll the way at the end.<br />
<br />
He didn’t make much small talk with his cousins.  They were all more acquainted with each other than he was.<br />
<br />
“As always, we’ll begin with the kids table.”  The announcer man stated.  The kids around Dylan all clapped as they got into line. One by one they grabbed presents.<br />
<br />
Dylan had to make a decision.  He ended up going with an orange present with a yellow ribbon.  He wanted to avoid being a girl more than anything and pink presents usually girls and certain blue presents were wrapped to intentionally to deceive young boys trying to avoid being girls.  He learned that the hard way when he turned into his cousin Lori one year.<br />
<br />
The kids then went into the changing room in a random order.  Eventually Dylan’s name was randomly selected to go next.  He made his long walk over to the changing room.  He could see his cousin Arthur explaining to his boyfriend what all the hype was around him. <br />
<br />
“Would you like some assistance in the changing room?” <br />
<br />
Dylan almost forget about how the family assigned someone to help get people dressed in their new bodies if they needed it. It was especially helpful with the younger kids. But even some of the adults needed help getting into their clothing.<br />
<br />
“No thank you, I think I’ll be fine.”<br />
<br />
The family member nodded and prompty left Dylan to change in private.<br />
<br />
“Ok, guess this it it.”  Dylan unwrapped the present and opened the box.<br />
<br />
“You’ve got to be kidding me...”<br />
He held up a pair of colorful comic-book hero-themed underwear.  It had to be for a kid around 7 years old.  The box also contained a pair of brightly colored crocs.<br />
<br />
“I could’ve sworn they changed the rules last year to full outfits only!”<br />
<br />
Dylan swallowed his pride and began to slide into small underwear.  He had be careful not to rip them.  “They’re all gonna have a field day with this...” He thought as he felt the fabric stretch over his muscular ass. <br />
<br />
“Fuck, my cock barely fits in this thing.” After miraculously not tearing the undies, he inspected the crocs that were mean’t to look like little race cars.  He looked down at his large feet.<br />
<br />
“These are gonna need to wait until after I transform.”He put the crocs back down. <br />
<br />
On the wall was the mysterious stone passed down his family for generations.  It was pitch black and super shiny, he could could see his reflection in it. <br />
<br />
“Here goes nothing”  Dylan placed his hand on the stone.  It was strangely warm to the touch.  A familiar glow began to envelop his body as time around seem to freeze.  He quickly shot down several inches and felt relief as the underwear began to loosen.  His dark chestnut hair lighted a couple shades and reshaped itself into a subtle Mohawk.  <br />
<br />
Dylan groaned once again and put on the silly crocs that now fit perfectly. He then opened the door and walked out before the crowd.</p>
