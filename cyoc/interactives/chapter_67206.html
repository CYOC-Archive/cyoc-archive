<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Fem-Master: Reversal Of Fortune by DebWeb<br />
<br />
Using her own ring(as a witch, she had at least ten reality altering rings on her person at anytime), she reversed the changes on Josh and put them onto Mark, where Josh was now the Femmaster, and Mark was now themind controlled, helpless soon to be girl...<br />
<br />
<br />
The witch aimed her ring towards the offending ring wearer and a bright bolt of light shot out of the inlaid moonstone on the flat oval.<br />
<br />
Josh was in the pit of despair as he writhed on the ground. It was not caused by any undue pain but an uncomfortable sensation which seemed to bore through his muscle toned body. It seemed as if worms had entered his ten digits of feet and hands. He felt as if his tendons and muscles were being hungrily devoured as the offending parasites slowly but inexonerably made their way towards his vital extremities. As they progressed Joseph could feel himself become weaker as if his masculinity was being drained from his very being.<br />
<br />
Mark had a wild eyed manic expression on his face as he savoured the power of the ring. The more he felt Josh’s masculinity ooze into his pores and accuent his own physique the more his own sanity seemed to slip away from him.<br />
<br />
Josh lay still on the floor as if in resignation to his fate as the strange burrowing sensation reached his upper thighs. He could feel the weakness and fragility of his legs as the fatty deposits beneath the skin wobbled in an alien manner. It was akin to death as all his previous boyhood memories flashed before his very eyes. Could he live a life in the caricature of his dream woman’s body? A life of domesticity and submissiveness to men? Perhaps it would have been better to have no memories of his stolen boyhood after all.<br />
<br />
A brilliant white light lit up the room as if a lightning bolt had struck! Josh felt a band of warm steel wrap around his index finger. The strange burrowing feeling suddenly went into reverse as it suddenly traversed back the way it had come. To Josh’s relief he could feel the strength gradually return to his legs.<br />
<br />
Mark was stunned as he felt his ill gotten extra masculine strength vacate his body quicker than it had entered. He studied his now bare ring finger in confusion as he wondered where the ring had gone.<br />
<br />
Meredith the cunning old witch decided to stay her anger as the boy she had gifted the ring to was not responsible for all the chaos that had unfolded. Yes he had been naive and too trusting but after this harsh lesson he may still be worthy of ownership in order to do good. Her judgement of character had never failed her before.<br />
<br />
<br />
With renewed vigour Josh rose from the floor and looked his nemesis squarely in the eye. His former best friend seemed like a stranger to him now. All those former childhood years they had shared seemed to have been a lie and in reality he never knew how much evil Martin was capable of.<br />
<br />
Martin had lost his bravado along with the ring and was now cowering in front of his supposed best friend. It was as if a dark and oppressive shadow had been lifted from his soul and the stark realization of his actions were hittting home. To his horror he watched as Josh lifted his fisted hand and pointed the ring towards him.<br />
<br />
Josh felt a strange calmness as he aimed the ring towards his former friend. Their was no anger or any emotion, just a steely determination that Martin needed to learn an important lesson in life. With the merest thought ‘reverse spell’ running through his mind an intense beam of light shot out of the flat oval of the ring and enveloped Martin.<br />
<br />
For an onlooker it seemed to take seconds to witness the dramatic transformation but for Martin it seemed like an eternity.<br />
<br />
As that burrowing sensation entered the tips of his fingers and toes he felt all the strength drain out of him. His muscles were disentegrating only to be replaced by  female subterraneous fat. His legs felt like jelly and gave way as he slumped to his knees on the floor. While he knelt on the floor in the doggy position supported by his knees and elbows he felt a strange softness in his hips and ass. The pelvis felt gelatinous as the bones swelled and widened. The flesh on his arse cheeks seemed to feel bloated as they reconfigured themselves into an appropriate heart shape as befitting a woman with child bearing hips. The compression of his waist may have been most discomfitting had it not been for another more pressing discomfort. To Martin’s horror he could feel his penis begin to tug upwards as if looking for a place of refuge from the impending onslaught. As he felt his testicles pull upwards into his body and his scrotum getting ever so tighter he looked pleadingly at his best friend Josh.<br />
<br />
Witnessing this horrible mutation being inflicted on his ex buddy Josh he was overcome with compassion. As he was about to reverse this atrocity he caught Meredith’s eye and was discouraged from intervening by her withering look. It was hard to watch his former best friend’s arse widening and seeing his cock and balls retract until all there was left were the fleshy folds of a vulva.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Mark was feeling it as his outie was becoming an inie. His felt as if he had an internal hard on as his virginal vaginal canal widened to accomodate his testicles retreat up to his newly formed womb. They were of course headed to their new home in the phalopian tubes as they underwent their own sex change and became fertile eggs. Mark felt a gentle tearing as the seam of his former scrotum opened to accomodate his genitals new function in life. He felt his urethera slip out of his forming clitoris and settle into its proper home. The newly formed clit retreated beneath the protective folds of his venus mound.<br />
<br />
Josh looked on aghast at the demise of his life long childhood friend as he barely recognized this waif of a creature. Even though this fate had been wished upon him by the victim it was still hard to stand by and watch such an abomination. Even facing Marks bent back as he was laid doggy position on the floor it was plain to see his ever swelling tiities from either side of his now petite body frame.<br />
<br />
Although Mark was fully aware that his manhood had been replaced by a fully functioning pussy it was still shocking to feel his nipples tugging on his chest. The initial pain and itchiness of his puffy chest was almost unbearable. It was somewhat of a relief to him when they reached a B cup and an aleviation of the pain. It suddenly crossed his mind that he had sort of coerced Josh into all red heads should have big tits as well as a big arse. Sure enough they kept swelling. B, C, D...DD. Oh my god! ‘They are so big I’m going to be so adored by the boys’ he thought. Martin could not understand how such a feminine thought could enter his head.<br />
<br />
Josh could hardly believe what he was seeing as this newly formed girl rolled over on to her big rump and sat their rubbing her titties. He could not help but use the female pronouns now as Martin was more girl than boy now. The final phaze would be her face and hair and then she would look like a sex nymph. Josh was wrong of course because he had forgotten one major detail.<br />
<br />
Martin could not believe he was sitting their playing with his big tits but it felt so nice. He felt so moist and tingly down below. ‘I am so wet and willing for my man’ Martin recoiled as that unbidden thought passed through his mind. He was distracted by a simillar sensation on his jaw that he had experienced in his hip region.<br />
<br />
Josh watched in morbid fascination as Martin’s face started to ripple and reform into smaller and daintier features. The chin reshaped itself from the once square jaw into a fragile heart shape as the mouth widened and the lips puffed up into a sexy pout. The once pronounced nose shrunk into an upturned button nose with a cute sprinkling of freckles. Her eyes grew larger as her cheekbones raised themselves up to be closer to those now shallow eybrows. The forehead seemed to reduce in size as the hairline seemed to crawl forward. Strangely it was the hair recolouring itself red that was most disconcerting. There was no mistaking this new girl for a he anymore.<br />
<br />
The strange sensations of the reshaping of Martin’s face was not uppermost in his own mind. No, it was the strange and alien thoughts passing through his mind that most preoccupied him at this moment in time. Things such as wanting a boyfriend and doing her best to please him. Or feeling guilty for not helping mummy with the household chores and why did he suddenly think that Josh was such a hunk? How could he think that about his best friend he reprimanded himself! He would make a nice boyfriend though. Something was tickling him as it rapidly crawled down his neck and back. Reaching his slim hand behind him he pulled forth a handfull of silky smooth red hair in front of his eyes and frowned as she noticed some split ends. I really must go to the salon and get them treated. What will Josh think if he see’s them? Martin was mortified as he felt himself drowning in a sea of femininity. No matter how he tried to fight these girly thoughts the were becoming more and more of a compulsion. Was this her life from now on? To live a life of confliction by being male on the inside and somehow compelled to live as a dainty girly only wanting to please men...?</p>
