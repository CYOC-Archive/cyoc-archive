<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr Jenkins woke groggily to a series of soft snuffling noises. He jumped when he saw an enormous furry head looming over him. It took him a second to remember where he was as the shock of the situation took him over. He jumped up and it all came back to him: he was now a bird, a hawk to be precise, and standing in front of him now was an enormous squirrel!<br />
<br />
While the rodent wouldn’t have normally scared him this one was quite intimidating up close, given that it was about the same size as his new hawk body. Jenkins felt uneasy as he sensed that something was wrong with this whole situation. Shouldn’t a squirrel be scared of a bird of prey? And what was it sniffing at so enthusiastically?<br />
<br />
This thought made Jenkins turn his attention back to himself. His body felt hot and flushed, almost like he had a fever. Meanwhile his avian cloaca was swollen and throbbing, making him feel quite queasy and uncomfortable. The air seemed to be thick and heavy as an unfamiliar scent wafted into the doctor’s nostrils. He suspected that this was what the squirrel was interested in. The smell was sweet and sharp, making him slightly woozy as he inhaled it.<br />
 <br />
This had to be the result of the transformation serum. His own equine formula sent its subjects into sexual overdrive, thus maximising the chances that they sealed their own fates by letting themselves be mated. But then why was this squirrel interested in him? Maybe the Zoo had found a way to attract other sorts of animals, not just those from the same species! Did the squirrel want to…<br />
<br />
Jenkins’ train of thought was interrupted abruptly as he was suddenly pushed forward. He ended up falling face-first, leaving him crumpled in a heap with his ass up in the air. He tried to get back up but two large hands kept his body pressed flat against the floor of the nest. He began to panic as he continued to struggle, but the rodent held him firmly in place as it loomed above him.<br />
<br />
Jenkins’ eyes then shot open when he felt something hard and wet poking around beneath his tail. He squawked desperately as he uselessly flapped his wings and flailed his talons, urgently trying to break free as he knew what the squirrel was trying to do. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the squirrel wasn’t deterred. Jenkins cried out as the rock-hard object finally connected with his exposed cloaca. His whole body tensed up as his tight virgin opening was spread open for the first time. He then felt a wet splatter inside his channel before several inches of something stiff and meaty sank inside him. Jenkins was utterly horrified by what was happening; he now had a squirrel’s cock stuffed inside him!<br />
<br />
Jenkins cried out in denial as the squirrel started to work its hips, making the cock sink in and out of his tight channel. He kept trying to break free but the squirrel’s clawed hands pressed hard against his shoulders, keeping him securely pinned in place as his body was violated.<br />
<br />
However, despite the horror of the situation, Jenkins couldn’t deny the pleasure that was starting to radiate throughout his body. The way the rodent’s cock stretched and teased the sensitive flesh in the depths of his channel made him shudder in shameful enjoyment. He knew his body was treacherously encouraging the squirrel as it grew wet and gripped the advancing shaft tightly.<br />
<br />
Before long, Jenkins could sense that the brutal fucking was nearing its conclusion. The squirrel was now thrusting into him with a furious tempo, making its furry balls slap against his ass as its cock hammered into his passage again and again.<br />
<br />
Jenkins grimaced as he sensed his body beginning to convulse in pleasure. He squawked out as his cloaca quivered and tensed, releasing a small squirt of fluids in the process as he was forced over the edge.<br />
<br />
Not long after the hawk’s climax the squirrel decided to finish what it had started. It gripped hard with its hands, pulling Jenkins back as it simultaneously pushed forward with its cock. Jenkins squawked out in shock and discomfort as his passage was suddenly filled by the entire throbbing length of the squirrel’s shaft. <br />
<br />
With its stiff cock now fully buried inside the hawk’s tight orifice, the squirrel started to shudder as its balls tensed up. The rodent then unleashed its own wild cry as the first jets of semen splattered deep inside the bird’s channel.<br />
<br />
Jenkins felt sick as the creamy cum started to fill him up. The thick gooey mixture was soon spilling out of his opening as it yawned wide open for the squirrel’s girthy penis. The speckled feathers between his legs were soon covered with strands of white as the cum ran over and between them.<br />
<br />
The couple remained joined together for a minute-or-so before the squirrel was finally satisfied. It slowly pulled its cock free, leaving Jenkins shaking as his aching cloaca was left hanging open and leaking various fluids.<br />
<br />
However, Jenkins wasn’t given long to wallow in his humiliation before an uneasy feeling settled in his stomach and a familiar pain gripped his body once again...</p>
