<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bridget Kelly stood behind the checkout counter of the Lustful Heart Lingerie and Adult toy store just off the strip in Las Vegas Nevada. As a daughter of Ireland the bright sun wasn’t good on her pale skin but one of the best university for her degree happened to be in this den of sin in the middle of the desert. <br />
<br />
She cracked her neck and looked up at the clock, her shift was about half over and then she could go out and do things she wanted to do. She didn’t mind her job but dealing with the customers was a pain in the ass, with the biggest headache trying to explain to women why they didn’t fit in the same size lingerie that they did on their wedding night 20+ years and 2 or 3 kids later. Or worse dealing with the men who where shopping with women 20 or more years their junior. That was just sick in her view. <br />
<br />
Still overall it was an ok job, and she did get some stuff on steep discount which really was fun for her own love life. <br />
<br />
She was about to go on break when a women walked in the front door, to say this woman was a 10 would put all other 10s to shame. Her silky-smooth black hair seemed impossible, and everything seemed just the right size, not too big yet big enough and her body was perfect. Better than the photos of the models they had on the wall.<br />
<br />
“Hello welcome to Lustful Heart Lingerie and Adult Toy store.” greeted Bridget as she walked up. “How can I be of help?”<br />
<br />
“Yes….” said the women as Bridget felt her eyes on her. “You can be of great help.”<br />
<br />
“How can I help you today….” started Bridget as her eyes focused on these women, it was as if the world around her was disappearing and all that mattered was this stranger before her.<br />
<br />
“Do you have somewhere private?” inquired the women.<br />
<br />
“Yes, we have multiple changing rooms.” said Bridget as almost all other sound seamed to disappear so only this women’s voice was all she heard.  “What sort of items do you want.”<br />
<br />
“Bring me some of your best items and some items you like for yourself.” said the women.<br />
<br />
“Workers don’t….” started Bridget<br />
<br />
“You do now.” Countered the women “Show me to the most private room and then gather the items I require.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Queen Lilith.” Answered Bridget, not knowing how she knew this women’s name.<br />
<br />
She showed her to the back VIP room and made sure to grab a bottle of the special champagne they kept for VIP and high rollers. The room was a good size room with multiple full mirrors and seats including one large chair. Bridget knew some of the VIPs who used it had had private shows with the women whom they were buying the lingerie for changing in and out for them. <br />
<br />
“Here you go, my Queen.” answered Bridget as she poured the champagne before going out and gathering a couple of the best pieces in the store in the size of the queen and her own size as well.<br />
<br />
She walked in to find Queen Lilith had moved the large chair from the corner to the center of the room. <br />
<br />
“Lock the door.” ordered Lilith as Bridget did what she was told. <br />
<br />
Queen Lilith stood up, her body transforming from the model worthy women to the goddess of all succubus and Incubus. Her skin turning a bright red as bat like wings and horns grew out of her back and on top of her head. <br />
<br />
“You are currently under my spell child, but soon you will have the honor to be the first of my subjects and your mind will fully return to being under your own control.” Explained Lilith in a smooth sexy voice, “Within reason, you will of course be loyal to me other then that your will be your own.”<br />
<br />
“I understand.” said Bridget as part of her human self was screaming in her mind even as she moved forward. Until she was standing directly before Lilith. Lilith was taller than she was, her breasts were almost at neck height in comparison. So she had too look up as Lilith looked down.<br />
<br />
“You look good as a human, can’t wait to see you as one of my subjects.” Said Lilith as she leaned down and kissed Bridget.<br />
<br />
Bridget eyes widened as she kissed this Goddess, her body burned with energy as it began to change. It started at all places her lips turned from their normal shade to a shade of bright green at the same time they became fuller. Her pale skin began to turn even paler as all color disappeared from them, like before it started at her mouth and moved across her face and down her neck. <br />
<br />
As the color disappeared from her face, her multiple freckles another clear sign of her Irish background remained but became a beautiful green color. Her eyes shifted to the same green color as did her eyebrows. Her natural red hair turned a brighter shade of red as the curls she had become fuller and thicker.<br />
<br />
“Good.” said Lilith as she pulled back. “I like the white and the green with the red, really works well.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, my Queen.” answered Bridget as she lowered herself down and began to suckle on her goddess breast. Lilith moaned softly which was music to Bridget’s ears, as she did her body became more sexy, any fat disappeared replaced by the body Bridget always dreamed of having but never could. Her breasts grew at least a cup size and became firmer to the point that her uniform was straining to the point of breaking and her bra was now painful to have on. She had never been this turned on before as her panties became soaked. <br />
<br />
Still it was as if the heavy breast milk of her goddess was downloading information into her brain. She now knew the entire history of her kind and why her goddess had chosen this city to be the corner stone of her new empire.<br />
<br />
“I hope I did well my Queen.” Said Bridget as she pulled away.<br />
<br />
“You did good, now finish your transformation and become the 1st of my subjects.” Ordered Lilith <br />
<br />
“Of course, my Queen.” said Bridget as she got down on her knees and began to pleasure her goddess with her mouth. <br />
<br />
Here the final transformations happened, with a snap her bra gave way as a pair of wings appeared on her back ripping off her shirt as well. A smooth tail tipped with one sharp curved point grew out of her tailbone. Her knees and elbows burst as rich green spikes grew out, they were sharp enough to be used as weapons but folded perfectly into her new body. A pair of upper and lower fangs grew in as well as a longer tongue which she used with expect skill to please her goddess. Finally, out of that mess of red curly hair grew a pair of neon green horns which moved back along the top of her head before taking a curl upwards.<br />
<br />
Finally she had the great honor of her goddess climaxing in her mouth, not all would have this great honor but she did and she licked it up with pleasure before standing up. She was still shorter than her goddess but now only by a few inches.<br />
<br />
“You came out very well, are you ready to serve your Goddess?” inquired Lilith <br />
<br />
“Of course, my Goddess what do you require of me.” answered Bridget</p>
