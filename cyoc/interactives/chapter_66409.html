<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The blast from the turret hit the surprised Wonder Gal square in the stomach. She was knocked backwards off <br />
her feet, landing on the hard ground with a grunt of discomfort. There was no flash of pain, though, so she <br />
figured her super powers had thwarted the brunt of the shot. Dr. Mage had descended and cast a spell of <br />
destruction on the turret. A trail of smoke wafted from the carriage.<br />
<br />
Wonder Gal got back to her feet, inspecting her stomach. There was a singe across the shiny material but it <br />
was still intact. She glanced at the crowd of pedestrians, searching for the mother who had pushed the <br />
carriage, but couldn't tell who had done it nor did she know if the person was still present.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you all right?&quot; the Sorcerer Supreme asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Whatever it was doesn't seem to have affected me.&quot; She eyed the ruin of the turret. The wail of police <br />
sirens were getting closer. &quot;Let's go. The authorities can take it from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The duo swiftly departed, returning to the rooftops. A short ways away they parted company as Laura and Tony, <br />
each one returning home after the excitement of the morning.<br />
<br />
<br />
Laura hit the fridge as soon as she got home feeling an odd emptiness in her stomach that she attributed to <br />
hunger. She made herself a large turkey sandwich, grabbed a snack bag of chips and a glass of milk, and headed <br />
for the den. She switched on the television and dug in. The channel was one of those real-life types and it <br />
was currently airing a show about pregnant mothers and getting used to their newborns after birth. Laura was <br />
about to switch it when she saw the featured mother, nine months pregnant, her belly so large and stretched <br />
that it looked like a small torpedo jutting out from her small frame. She had to lie on her side to be <br />
anywhere near comfortable. She was pregnant with triplets.<br />
<br />
Something about the show seemed to interest her so Laura left it alone and continued eating. Once she finished <br />
her sandwich she moved onto the chips, devouring them quickly. She still felt empty, though she was beginning <br />
to also feel full. Perturbed, Laura returned to the kitchen during a commercial break and grabbed an apple, <br />
some oatmeal cookies, and a slice of pound cake her mother had made in honor of her graduation. Laura ate as <br />
she watched the mother cradle her enormous belly, she ate as the mother grunted and screamed in childbirth, <br />
and she ate as the mother held her three baby girls for the first time. By the end of the show she felt <br />
stuffed, her belly tight with food, but the empty feeling had receded and was replaced with a warm, pleasant <br />
glow. Underneath it Laura found herself feeling horny too.<br />
<br />
She thought of the show and imagined the mother trying to masturbate, having to stretch her arms around her <br />
thick belly, lifting up the weight of it to thrust her fingers inside her sloppy cunt. Laura closed her eyes, <br />
trying to imagine the feeling. She pushed a hand down the front of her pants and stroked along her pussy lips, <br />
using the tight full feeling in her stomach in place of the heavy baby weight of a pregnant woman. Then she <br />
pictured herself pregnant and ready to pop wearing her spandex costume as Wonder Gal. She imagined trying to <br />
leap onto a building but just wobbling and falling into pillows as she was overcome with horniness, fingering <br />
herself under her shiny skirt as her other hand rubbed her fat belly.<br />
<br />
With a soft groan, Laura came on her hand in a small trickle of fluid. She rode the wave of pleasure radiating <br />
out of her crotch, now imagining she was giving birth and feeling this good. But then she wouldn't be <br />
pregnant, wouldn't be full... So she'd have to go out and get knocked up again. And meanwhile she could feed <br />
her baby on her fat tits swollen with milk..<br />
<br />
Laura's eyes opened and she quickly removed her hand from her pants. It smelled of her sex and arousal. &quot;What <br />
am I doing...&quot; she muttered to herself. She was suddenly aware of what she had been fantasizing about and felt <br />
herself flush in embarrassment. Where had that come from? She'd never thought of pregnant as sexy, nor <br />
imagined herself fat with child. The thought of her bursting from her hero costume, though...<br />
<br />
She shook her head. She must have babies on the brain after what had happened earlier with the carriage and <br />
then chancing on the pregnancy show on TV. That must be it. Laura rubbed her full stomach as she took her <br />
dishes to the kitchen to load the dishwasher. She didn't notice how good it felt or that her nipples were <br />
poking through her top.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Science Master laughed his shrill, nervous laugh back in his lair. The morning had gone perfectly, far better <br />
than he had even planned. The goons he had hired to rob the bank had done their part in attracting attention <br />
and luring the heroes to the right place and then he himself had pushed the carriage out toward the <br />
unsuspecting Wonder Gal. The sight of her falling back from the blast had been beautiful!<br />
<br />
The gun had not been designed to hurt the heroine but to deliver a charged blast of nanobots. By now they were <br />
well integrated into her body and carrying out their pre-programmed instructions, changing her at a deep <br />
level. Wonder Gal was immune to magic but not, apparently, to the machinations of SCIENCE!<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon she will be flooded with hormones, making her highly fertile and capable of impregnation by any living <br />
thing! And the nanobots in her mind will tweak her wiring, making her desire to be a big, fat baby machine. <br />
She'll soon lactate at the sound of any baby crying and have an urge to feed them herself. Once she's knocked <br />
up the cycle will be irreversible! She'll birth and then do anything to get pregnant again and again. She's <br />
doomed!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Animus skulked in the shadowy corner of the lair. It was the night of the heist and Science Master was <br />
gleefully recounting his exploits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said the shadow. &quot;I will help her realize her new wants and desires. You must work on a way to get rid <br />
of Mage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I shall!&quot; boasted the villain. &quot;With the almighty power of SCIENCE!&quot; He burst into insane laughter once more <br />
as the shadow crept to the door and disappeared.<br />
<br />
<br />
Elsewhere in Glendale, Kylie moaned in her sleep.</p>
