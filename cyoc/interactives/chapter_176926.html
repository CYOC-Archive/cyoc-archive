<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Stop bothering me. You need to change. This country needs to change&quot;. Those words lodged in Cam&#39;s mind as Rep. Sewell strode toward his office. As he walked off Cam heard him mutter one more thing - &quot;kid looks like one of those tiktok queers&quot;. <br />
<br />
Cam was a little shaken, but he laughed at the idea the man with his dinosaur beliefs even knew what TikTok was. He was late for school, and picked up the pace while he looked down at his phone and brought up the app. The congressman wasn&#39;t wrong - Cam was a proud queer kid on TikTok, and had a sizeable following for his fabulous transformation videos, where he would change from his pale, skinny twink boy frame into make-up, sometimes even into full drag. With his long hair, he didn&#39;t even need to wear a wig to complete the look. It didn&#39;t exactly make him the most popular guy at school, but it was 2021. Most kids didn&#39;t care that he sometimes wore makeup, and the only ones that did were the real meathead football jocks and the small Young Republican group. His school was a tolerant one, and he was happy to be coming back from Winter break in his senior year. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the Young Republicans...or &quot;future leaders&quot;, he scoffed audibly, thinking of the congressman&#39;s remarks...here was Jessica Perkins, the president of the club. He rolled his eyes remembering how she had swooned over Rep. Sewell when he visited. He dreaded his encounters with the vapid christian girl - the folksy charm in her voice couldn&#39;t hide the spite when she talked about how men who dressed like women were going hell, and that she was praying for him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hiiii Cam,&quot; she said. Huh, weird, she seemed a lot friendlier than usual. &quot;You&#39;re looking great today.&quot; Was she...flirting with him? She, of all people, knew he was gay, and loved to remind him of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jessica,&quot; he said. He was a little surprised by how deep his voice sounded...he might be catching a cold. He hoped not, auditions for the Sound of Music were this week, and he couldn&#39;t not be cast in his favourite musical. &quot;Uh, thanks, I guess.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you&#39;re doing at the gym, it&#39;s DEFINITELY working&quot;, she giggled. Actually giggled. Cam almost laughed out loud - the gym? <br />
<br />
Well, yeah, he had spent winter break training hard. He unconsciously flexed his biceps, which were growing from a non existent 14 inches to a solid 19. He looked down at where Jess had placed her hand, saw a couple of light veins running up his tanning arms, and smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, thanks Jess.&quot; He started to stand up straighter, feeling pride start to swell his chest as his pecs grew out. He pulled his shoulders back as they started to grow too, and his back tightened to complete the changes to his upper body. <br />
<br />
He kinda felt a little strange as he continued striding towards class, with more of a sense of purpose than before. His butt started to clench tighter, his calves grew harder, his quads swelled with the muscle of a high school senior athlete. It was hard to concentrate with Jess by his side, complimenting him, while he kept on taking sidewards glances at her rack. He smiled to himself, knowing she had done that for him... <br />
<br />
Wait a minute, for him? Why would she do that for him when he was a fag? And why had he even thought that word? He started to scratch his head, momentarily missing the long hair that had been there a few moments ago, which had disappeared into a short faded crew cut. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, uh, what were you saying?&quot; Cam shook himself back to the present conversation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I just wanted to say your latest video was awesome, and I wanted to wish you good luck today!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What video?&quot; He was so confused...in his mind he could see this skinny loser staring at the mirror, and then the next minute...the faggot dressing up like a chick. Was that...was that him? &quot;I thought you didn&#39;t like my TikToks?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, why wouldn&#39;t I LOVE this?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jessica pulled up her phone, and Cam saw himself, his new self, dressed in a formal suit with a flag pin on his lapel. &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Cam Sewell&quot; he said to the camera. Then he picked up a football helmet, and the vid transitioned into him in his football gear, his abs showing, flexing cockle for the camera. &quot;And today is FOOTBALL TRYOUTS FAGGOTS!&quot; <br />
<br />
Cam Sewell put his arm around Jess as she lowered the phone, and pulled her in for a kiss. &quot;Babe, I don&#39;t need luck. I&#39;m Cam Sewell.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You are going to make your Dad so proud babe&quot; Jess said to him. &quot;Don&#39;t forget that after school we have another rally for him. Before the end of the year everybody in this schools gonna be voting for him!&quot;</p>
