<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You could see the shock on Brian's face even as you approached the car. You couldn't help but giggle as you realized how different you must seem from just last night. You walk confidently in your high heels, enjoying the feminine clack sound they make. You now walked with small, dainty steps, with a sexy swing of the hips, breasts thrust outward and chin held high. You enjoyed the swish of the light blue dress around your thighs, and the feel of your hair bobbing gently on your shoulders.<br />
<br />
You beam at him with bright white teeth and rich, full lips, shiny with pink lipstick. The black eye shadow made the mischievous glint in your green eyes stand out even more. You face was smooth and clean, your eyebrows plucked into a perfect line. Your very skin shone with a radiant glow that only the best day spa clinic for miles could give.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there!&quot; You greet him as you glide into the car, leaning over to kiss him on the cheek. &quot;Meet the new Brittni!&quot; You giggle. &quot;Do you like her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian stared at you, jaw agape. &quot;Uhh. Are you alright, Jack?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, Jack isn't here right now. I'm Brittni, how may I help you?&quot; You giggle then pat him on the arm. &quot;I'm just practicing my receptionist skills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were going to be a business woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now its your turn to gape as you give him a whack on the shoulder. &quot;Can you see someone as cool and sexy as me being such a sourpuss? I'm far too pretty to be a business woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack, what did they do to you?&quot; He asked as he put the car into gear and drove off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear, they just made me comfortable with who I am. Now, does Jack have a pussy that craves cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian glanced at you as he drove. &quot;No...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you shouldn't call me Jack then!&quot; You giggle for a while before composing yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;So tell me, how was the boys night out? Pick up any girls?&quot; You wink at him before giggling again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I kinda figured with you here, Brittni, I wouldn't need to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry pal, but your gonna have to work if you want to get a hold of these boobies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian blushes furiously and drives the rest of the way in silence. Back at your apartment you get out of the car, making sure to keep your knees modestly closed. As soon as you get into the apartment you walk off into the kitchen, knowing Brian would be hungry and wouldn't have prepared food.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just got to duck out to the shops.&quot; Brian called and you heard the door close behind him. As soon as that door locked it was like a veil was lifted from your eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- what happened?&quot; You ask, looking down at yourself. You're aware of everything after you walked out the doors of the clinic, but it was as though you had been viewing it as a passenger. Everything between walking through those doors Friday night and walking out again Saturday was a mystery to you though. The spa must have been good though, because you felt amazing! Even just standing there, you felt fresh, clean and lively.<br />
<br />
Realizing that Brian's presence was reducing you to a giggling, blabbering nymph, you proceeded to wedge a chair under the front door. When he came back you would just have to call him and explain what was happening. In the meantime, you decide to have a look in the handbag you realized was slung over your shoulder. <br />
<br />
Inside it you found a purse with your drivers license, bank card, work pass, and a membership card for the Revitalizing Minds Women's Health Clinic. According to all these cards, your name was now Brittni Rippon, you were aged twenty and worked as a receptionist for a small business a few blocks away.<br />
<br />
Other than the purse, you also found a small phone, a pack of tampons, some painkillers, a small makeup bag, a comb, a pack of gum and an envelope with your name neatly written in cursive hand on the front. As you were about to open it you hear a knock on the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Brittni? Why won't the door open?&quot; Whipping out the phone, you punch in Brian's number. &quot;What's going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nothing, just a trick.&quot; You giggle, becoming the passenger again as soon as you hear his voice. Opening the door, you look at what he bought from the store and frown. &quot;What do you need condoms for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I can think of a thing or two.&quot; Brian said, looping his arm around your waist and pulling you in close.<br />
<br />
His touch was sending waves of electricity rippling through your body, it was unlike anything you had ever felt before, and yet somehow familiar. You lent in close, pressing your breasts against his chest as they, along with the rest of your body, ached to be touched. Your lips parted slightly, of their own accord, and the next thing you know, his hand was running through your hair and the two of you were locked in a passionate kiss. Kicking the door closed behind him, you leap up and wrap your legs around his waist, allowing him to carrying you to the sofa. You squeal as you both fall onto it, and then you're trapped underneath him. But you are enjoying this too much to care. The close proximity, the taste of his kiss, the fire of his touch, it was all making your head swim.<br />
<br />
A knock on the door interrupts you as he reluctantly departs to answer it. And while outwardly you croon and spread yourself out like a cat, waiting for him to answer your soft, beckoning moans, inwardly you rejoice at the possibility you could be saved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hello!&quot; You hear him exclaim from the doorway, so you sit up, wondering who it is.</p>
