<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Everything that was happening to Mark was like something from his wildest fantasy of dog sex. Here was Mark now sitting in front of Bryan and licking the doggy cock, like it was a pop sickle. The taste was a bit on the salty side, but very arousing to the nose. Mark's on doggy cock was still hanging out and completely swollen while squirting the last remnants of its doggy seed.<br />
<br />
Bryan shows approval and gratification by licking Mark's muzzle affectionately. Although the licks feel good enough, his cock is already spent and begins shrinking, while retreating back into its sheath. Bryan then nudges his muzzle under Mark and begins to lick his cock clean as well. Mark responds with moans and flops onto his side. Bryan then lays on his side and finishes licking the shrinking cock in front of him.<br />
<br />
Mark resumes his licking and proceeds now to lick around the opening of Bryan's sheath, as his cock now retracts completely inside. The licking is then swiftly moved form the sheath down to the scrotum and finally Bryan's tail hole.<br />
<br />
Bryan responds by moving his tail away and begins giving Mark the exact same treatment, as his own cock retracts completely. The tail quickly moves away giving him access to Mark's own tail hole. The scent is very arousing and pushes Bryan to lick as firmly as possible. This elicits moans from his friend and no longer feels Mark's tongue on his own anal entrance.<br />
<br />
Mark then feels a stirring in his sheath already, but wants to do the one thing he has always wanted from a canine. He wants Bryan to take that sweet massive shepherd cock and breed him. He slowly raises himself back to his paws and notices the licking hasn't stopped. Bryan simply keeps licking his tail hole all the way. Then Bryan finally stops and gets up on his paws as well. It seems he is horny again and shows signs by way of his cock swelling in his sheath again. Mark moves his butt right into Bryan's face and looks over his shoulder at him.<br />
<br />
Bryan sees this and his new doggy instincts tell him what Mark wants. Feeling his cock hang half way out and his scrotum churn once again, he decides to give the horny shepherd what he wants. He shifts his position and then launches his chest onto Mark's rump. Then he reaches and hooks his legs around the shepherd's midsection, just as his hips begin to instinctively girate. His cock is now completely out and begins squirting its precum. The smell of it in the air and on the floor sends Bryan into full breeding mode.<br />
<br />
Mark knows what is coming next and enjoys the sensation of his new canine lover on his rump. The apllied pressure around his midsection causes him to shift backwards a bit and is rewarded by warm wet squirts of precum on his balls and anal ring. Then he finally feels it. Bryan has found his mark and plunges his moist hot doggy tool all the way.<br />
<br />
( In Character Now )<br />
It seem he wants your hole as much as you want his cock in there. You feel the slight lump of his inflating doggy knot, as his balls then slap against yours and he begins his initial fast test humps. He seems confident he is indeed in you and pulls himself completely onto your back, while his hips begin pounding your backside mercilessly. His head then rests right next to your own.<br />
<br />
His panting and occasional licks on the ear translate into pure lust and sexual bliss. You begin to whimper with delight as his thrusts get shorter and the knot gets bigger inside you. It would seem changing into a shepherd has made him into an gay dog sex machine. Your cock now hangs freely and begins swelling, just as his knot begins bumping and rubbing your prostate inside. This in turn causes your cock to throb and the anal ring to clench behind that sweet throbbing swollen tennis ball inside you.<br />
<br />
He then begins to whimper, his thrusts get shallow and his knot then stops to rest right on your prostate. This brings more whimpers and moans from your muzzle, as your now swollen cock and knot throb hard. Your ears pick up the sound of something wet squirting at the carpet, as you feel jets of your precum shooting out of you shaft.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Bryan has stopped his whimpering and has settled into grooming your entire head and neck. The feel of his tongue pressing beyond the fur translates to pure bliss. You moan with delight as he proceeds to flood your entire anal cavity with his watery seed. You raise your head up slightly and catch the side of his muzzle with a couple of firm sensual licks. Bryan makes no attempt to dismount and turn around. He seems content to stay just like this and enjoy the mutual doggy embrace.<br />
<br />
The two of you continue to stand there, basking in your combined warmth and sigh at the sound of chaos erupting outside. The sounds being nothing more than the last of the human race protesting against the new fate Nature has chosen for them. Their protests seem to blend with the chorus of barking excited dogs. It all merges together into the music of the coming evolutionary shift. You think to yourself, &quot;How could anyone protest being changed in such a pleasurable way?&quot; The two of you then sigh again and resume the sensual licking of muzzles. Somehow this seems to be a far better life than the one you had before.</p>
