<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>1) There are several related stories in this chapter where they all occur at exactly the same time.<br/>
<br/>
2) This chapter takes into account that the transformative energy wave passed a few minutes before midnight.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Phil was working at night in a convenience store. The work was monotonous as he hardly had any clients this late at night and he had practically nothing to do. He would love to change jobs, but for now he would have to put up with it as it was what was helping him pay for college.<br />
<br />
It was a few minutes before midnight and he was nearing the end of his shift when a woman came in and walked over to where the instant food was. When she was going to get the product she chose she stopped and screamed. Phil ran to see what had happened, he felt a strange weight on his chest but thought he had more important things to do and decided to ignore it for the time being.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; The woman asked Phil with tears running down her face as she showed her hands, which he couldn&#39;t identify to which species it belonged to but clearly weren&#39;t human, apart from having an orange fur that was spreading across the rest of her arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but we have to get help and fast.&quot; Phil said, but he was surprised his voice had come out very different, undeniably feminine, what made him look down and feel his face. The roughness of his two-day beard was gone and his uniform blouse was extremely full, which touching him found that six huge breasts (H-cup) had grown on his chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t want that. Please stop.&quot; the girl said desperately, which made Phil look to pay attention to her again and see that her body was covered entirely in orange fur, her ears were now pointed and were above her head. She was holding a huge bulge that had formed in the back of her pants, but her efforts were futile and the fabric didn&#39;t resist, being torn by a kangaroo tail that had grown on her.<br />
<br />
Phil decided to call some ambulance but when he turned around to pick up the phone he fell down as he couldn&#39;t move his legs individually. Looking to see the problem he saw that his legs had fucked up and had scales growing on them, which quickly turned into a fish tail. The last thing he felt was what felt like a suction on his crotch, which made him reach out and find his cock and balls had disappeared, leaving only a vertical opening in its place. Totally confused at having become a mermaid with six huge breasts during work he looked at the woman, who had turned into an anthro kangaroo.<br />
<br />
The two transformed women looked at each other, confused by what had happened and worried about their future.<br />
<br />

Sophia woke up in the middle of the night listening to her daughter crying. She was a single mother who had to take care of her child by herself after her fiance died in a car accident a few days before the wedding, just a few days before she knew she was pregnant.<br />
<br />
She was breastfeeding her two month old daughter when the unexpected happened, the girl merged and was totally absorbed by the breast she has her mouth on, which became huge, being K-cup, her other breast grew to the same size. Sophia was in shock from what happened to her daughter when a mouth formed in place of the nipple of her breast that absorbed her baby and began to cry. Seeing her daughter become her breast made Sophia not even care what happened to herself, her lower half becoming the body of a male horse, making her a shemale centauress.<br />
<br />
Only when Sophia&#39;s right breast, which was her daughter, started to suckle from her other breast and the crying stopped, could she analyze more calmly everything that had happened.<br />
<br />

Anna was a student and was alone at home trying to sleep, but she was very nervous due to the upcoming exams and she couldn&#39;t sleep. She was staring at the ceiling in during her insomnia when a tingling hit her vagina and her head before she felt something strange happen and she suddenly found herself with her head covered under her blanket. She tried to pull the blanket off her face thinking she had fallen asleep without realizing it and had just woken up, but not only did she not find the blanket on her pillow, she also didn&#39;t find her own head. <br />
<br />
Scared of what she felt, Anna jumped out of bed, letting the blanket fall to the floor. once she was standing up, she noticed that all the furniture in the room seemed to be taller, but she had an idea of &#8203;&#8203;what had happened when she saw her dimly lit reflection in the mirror. She turned on the lights whose switch was above her line of sight and her hand also higher than her head, but the lighting made her see better and make sure that for some reason her head had swapped places with the her vagina, which was now between her shoulders.<br />
<br />
Anna never hid anything from her parents and decided to call them to report what had happened and seek help, so she went to their room where the two were sleeping. As she opened the door and turned on the light, she was surprised to see that there was something large lifting her parents&#39; blanket, as well as two more smaller things closer to her mother&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want to wake us up Anna?&quot; Anna&#39;s mother said, standing up and letting the blanket slip from her chest, who was as surprised by what she saw there as her daughter. As was her custom she had slept in her panties, and where her nipples should be, her breasts had a pair of 8 inch hard cocks, each with a ballsack at its base. She also noticed the pillar that was still covered by the blanket and discovered it, discovering it was a 17-inch cock that was attached between her legs, where there was a ballsack with coconut-sized testicles in place of her vagina.<br />
<br />
Anna and her mother looked at her father, who strangely hadn&#39;t shown any reaction despite the commotion and found an inflatable sex doll wearing his pajamas instead.<br />
<br />

<br />
Maria and Tom were a couple who considered themselves very happy. Both were 34 years old and had two children, but they had decided they wanted one more child. They were enjoying that the kids were sleeping and they were having sex when things started to get weird. <br />
<br />
First, Tom&#39;s cock got stuck inside Maria&#39;s pussy, so it wouldn&#39;t go in or out anymore. First, Tom&#39;s cock got stuck inside Maria&#39;s pussy, so it wouldn&#39;t go in or out anymore. They looked closer and saw that they had merged in the area of &#8203;&#8203;their genitals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do we merge?&quot; Maria asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m also curious, I didn&#39;t even know this was possible.&quot; Tom said<br />
<br />
The changes continued as Maria&#39;s right leg and Tom&#39;s left leg fused together and then assumed a cylindrical shape, the bones completely disappeared and the foot turned to a pink mushroom-shaped tip. The couple&#39;s new shared cock had formed and was the same size as one of their legs, and Tom&#39;s balls, which stayed underneath, had grown to be the size of beach balls.<br />
<br />
Tom and Maria were starting to get worried about the situation and wanted to know if they could get back to normal, but they heard Dani, their youngest 10-year-old daughter, start crying in her room. They ran as best they could in their new shared body, but when they tried to open the door they couldn&#39;t because there was something holding inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dani my daughter, what&#39;s the problem?&quot; Maria asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, it&#39;s too tight, it&#39;s hurting me.&quot; Dani said<br />
<br />
&quot;What is tight my daughter?&quot; Tom asked<br />
<br />
&quot;This box is tight. Why put me in a box? Dani said<br />
<br />
&quot;But which box?&quot; Maria and Tom questioned together, but they had no time for an answer before they heard a very loud bang from their youngest daughter&#39;s room and felt a tremor.<br />
<br />
Desperate the conjoined couple tried to open the bedroom door once more, this time opening it easily, but being totally shocked by what they found. Most of the room had been destroyed as if a bomb had gone off there, with almost nothing left but a small strip near the wall where the door was located. otherwise both the walls and the ceiling of the room no longer existed.<br />
<br />
Looking beyond the damage, Tom and Maria found Dani lying on the garden floor in front of the house and at first glance they only found it strange that she was naked, only to realize later that she was huge, certainly bigger to fit inside her room. <br />
<br />
They couldn&#39;t tell what, but they were sure that something strange had fused them both and the same thing had made Dani grow so big that her bedroom structure couldn&#39;t resist and was destroyed, with debris flying across the street and the their daughter falling to the ground. The noise woke up the neighborhood and one by one the lights of the other houses came on and screams could be heard coming from them, which left them worried about their son in the room across the hall.</p>
