<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#9835;You were the apple of the public&#39;s eye as you cut the ribbon at the local mall<br />
A mirage for both you and us. How can it be real? &#9835;*<br />
<br />
Absently singing and humming the last song he heard on the radio; Benton entered into his Moon Lake business headquarters. It was clear he was in a good mood as he passed various employees; most looking surprised to see their boss not in the usual surly or curt mood he is typical to show up in, a few thinking this is wrong, do what they can to get out of the were-panthers way.<br />
<br />
&#9835;Well are you really who we think you are<br />
Or does that smile seem to wear you down&#9835;*<br />
<br />
“At times it does,” Benton wheels around after he closes his office door. Turning on the lights; not that he needed them to see, Benton notices a Japanese woman with greying hair sitting in a chair by his desk.<br />
“And just how did you manage to get past security Tachibana No Akane,” Benton looking at the woman; his cheerful demeanor rapidly disappearing.<br />
While the Skulk is a security force,” Tachibana smiling wryly; “a division to Tachibana enterprises. The skulk was once an ancient and sacred ninja society.”<br />
“Weren’t Ninja and Samurai considered natural enemies,” Benton glaring at the were-vixen<br />
“That didn’t mean the local lords,” Tachibana answering; “wouldn’t enlist the services of a ninja clan. Despite being spies, assassins and without honor; Ninjas were also used as couriers and in extremes as a security force.”<br />
“That doesn’t explain how you got in here,” Benton speaking; “specifically in my office.”<br />
<br />
“I could spin you a tale,” Tachibana getting up; “one worthy of a possible Oscar nomination. But suffice to say my getting into your office undetected is the least of your concerns.”<br />
“Than what is it woman,” Benton’s civility rapidly fading; gripping the handle of his briefcase tightly as he starts to tense up.<br />
“A common enemy,” Tachibana not showing any fear; despite being in Benton’s house and the were-panther is by far the stronger of the two. “Jack Crawford,” Tachibana stating.<br />
<br />
Benton growls upon hearing that name. “I woke up in a good mood this morning,” Benton glaring; “I even read a wonder article posted in several newspapers. Now you spoil all that by mentioning that asshole’s name?”<br />
“I know you two have history,” Tachibana responds; “yet he has become my problem as well.”<br />
“You think I don’t know,” Benton snorting; “My brother told me of Jack’s threat to expose us all if he or Kenya is brought back to Moon Lake.”<br />
“Then you know what is at stake,” Tachibana answers back; watching Benton place his briefcase on his desk as he sits down.<br />
“Of course,” Benton looking at some emails; “but that doesn’t mean I don’t have my own plans to protect MY FAMILY.”<br />
“When you mean your family,” Tachibana slamming down Benton’s laptop; “is it just you, Amanda and Frieda? Or does that include you brother, his wife and unborn child? What about Frieda’s friends Spencer and Eric?”<br />
<br />
Benton growls as he stares at Tachibana; getting up from his desk, ready to shift into his fursona at a moment’s notice.<br />
“You have some nerve,” Benton growling; “do not think I have forgotten how you schemed with your white were-tiger guests to have Frieda emancipate me and Amanda. Secretly allowing them to stay in Moon Lake while the Chinese Government tries to downplay their disappearance.&quot;<br />
“We already had this argument,” Tachibana snapping back; “at my estate! You storming into my home with your fur up and claws bared! You’re lucky I didn’t have you cut down then and there!”<br />
“A debt between the skulk and Wang Technological Consortium,” Benton snarling; “did not wash with me then. And it doesn’t now!”<br />
“Then perhaps this will,” Tachibana tossing a USB drive on Benton’s desk; “Courtesy of Far Hojun and his grandson Kai.”<br />
“What is this,” Benton staring at Tachibana.<br />
“That was the item the white tiger clan gave me to unseat you from your company,” Tachibana responding; “you may not realize it but Far’s father was the one who set up your company’s network. That USB drive has in it, every single back door a person could need to undermine you. Now imagine Jack Crawford getting his paws on that,” Tachibana slamming her hand on Benton’s desk. “I’m handing it to you,” Tachibana regaining her composure; “so you know there will be no more scheming from me.”<br />
<br />
Benton looks at the unassuming digital storage device. A small item that could render him impotent in the cut throat corporate world.<br />
“You may not like Far and Kai,” Tachibana watching Benton closely; “but they have seen how you changed after being diagnosed with Bi-polar disorder. How you have improved your relationship with your daughter.<br />
“Stop,” Benton speaking; “enough. I don’t know what your end game is,” Benton tossing the USB drive in his briefcase; “but a peace offering like this just won’t cut it with me.”<br />
“Far and Kai have also bugged Jack’s computer,” Tachibana speaking; “Since last December. It was them that informed Lance about Jack trying to take back Crawford Computers. Is it true that is part of Frieda’s trust fund?”<br />
“That is none of your business,” Benton glaring; “and suffice to say, Jack has no chance in taking my daughter’s trust fund away. I’ve made sure of that. And before you start your next negotiating pitch, don’t,” Benton clearly in no mood for this conversation; “just because we have a common enemy, doesn’t mean we should work together for the common good.”<br />
<br />
“Jack Crawford had no qualms in ordering an attack on a teenager,” Tachibana walking to the door; “what makes you think he won’t do that again? Only this time with your wife, or perhaps Frieda?”<br />
“GET OUT,” Benton roaring; exploding into his fursona; black fur sprouting everywhere as he bulks up and grows into the hulking ten foot were-panther when shifted. “Any attack to my family,” Benton growling; “I will meet in kind.”<br />
<br />
Tachibana seeing that she touched a nerve as the were-panther she was talking with started to stalk her; forcing her out of his office. Seeing the snarling man at the threshold; Tachibana watches as the door slams in her face. Turning around to see security waiting for her, the were-vixen shakes her head.<br />
“Well that could have gone better,” she sighs as she starts walking out; “perhaps I can get Lance to convince Benton to help the council.”<br />
<br />
The security troupe doesn’t answer as they quietly escort Tachibana through the building; escorting her out the main door before closing it and locking it behind her. Tachibana looks back up to the section of the building where Benton’s office is; Shaking her head as a limo pulls up and the driver quickly getting out to open the door for her.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Back in Benton’s office, the were-panther removes the tatter remains of his suit and tosses it into the waste bin. Opening up a closet and seeing it full of finely tailored suits, Benton grabs one as he starts to defur. Putting it on and walking back to his desk; Benton gets on the phone and calls up his head of security.<br />
“I want you up in my office,” Benton speaking; “I want to know how Tachibana was able to get into my office without your men knowing. They are all weres, they should have smelled a were-fox roaming about.”<br />
Slamming the phone back down, Benton heads back to his laptop and goes back to reading and answering his various emails.<br />
