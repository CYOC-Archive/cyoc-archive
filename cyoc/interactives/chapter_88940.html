<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Casper watched as the opposing football team, at least most of them it seemed came pouring into the party.  Accompanying them were, he supposed girlfriends and other hangers on that followed the team.<br />
<br />
The noise of the party died down, everyone staring at the new arrivals, themselves staring at the party-goers.<br />
<br />
One of the newcomers, a big, buff guy weighing at least 230 lbs. swept his eyes over the assembled partyers, not even seeming to notice the fact that they were not even the same species, or even organic, as himself.  Upon spying Tommy, he smiled a predatory thing, and pointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; he said, &quot;Perkins, right?  You and me, lets go, lets settle this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Someone had killed the music, and everyone was silent.  Even the soft squeaking of latex bodies against themselves and each other had ceased as everyone went still, watching.<br />
<br />
The football player strode past Casper, and he could see the name Smith emblazoned on the back of his Varsity jacket as he moved over to take a seat at the table, the rubber bull boy across from him quickly vacating.  Smith removed his jacket and rolled up his T-shirt sleeve, propping his elbow in the middle of the table, looking at Tommy expectantly.<br />
Tommy just smiled and took a seat across from the young man, propping his own elbow on the table opposite, wrapping his shiny latex hand around the other&#39;s.<br />
The rest of the party just watched as the two footballers nodded to each other and began to arm wrestle.<br />
<br />
For 30 seconds, a minute, neither of them budged, though the strain of each could clearly be seen.  Muscles bulged and twitched, both on the human and on the shiny latex bull that was Tommy.  A moment more passed, and slowly, their arms began to move.  Tommy was slowly bearing this Smith&#39;s arm to the table!<br />
Casper could not resist, not when an opportunity like this just fell into his lap.<br />
Before Smith&#39;s arm touched the table, there was no longer a human sitting there, but a gleaming silver Puma, with a metallic white underside.  He was, like all the others, devoid of outward signs of gender, save a bulge at his crotch, but lacking nipples on his chest, and had a nozzle for a navel.  His hands had become paws, the slightly dull rubber claws extending as he grunted, squeaked and groaned trying to bend Tommy&#39;s arm back over.  His tail had appeared and was now poking out of the side of the chair, his shiny paw-like feet with their own rubbery claws trying to find better purchase on the floor.  His clothing had vanished, but his Varsity jacket had remained, draped over the chair where he had left it.<br />
<br />
With a last grunt of effort, Tommy flexed his bulging arm and slammed the other Synthetic&#39;s arm down on the table.<br />
<br />
Smith looked up at Tommy, his expression carefully blank, but then broke into a huge grin, causing the rest of the Synthetics, and his own teammates to burst out in a cheer.<br />
<br />
The newly made Synthetic got up and shook Tommy&#39;s hand vigorously, chuckling, &quot;Well, I guess I can&#39;t fault you for being stronger than me, you must put a lot of time in at the gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy smiled &quot;Yeah, Lana says I work out too much, but I&#39;ve seen how she looks at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You played a good game tonight, Perkins.  Though, thanks for inviting us to your party, not too many people would have done that, team rivalries being what they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You played really well too, Smith.  Just because we are on opposite teams, doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t have some fun off the field, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, yeah, I guess you are right.  Call me Dan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you can call me Tommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair of walking, talking pool-toy animal-people clapped each other on the back, Tommy inviting Dan over to the kitchen for a drink while Casper watched, pleased with how that turned out.<br />
<br />
He concentrated a bit then, issuing a string of commands to the ring.  He felt its assent to the mental activity, and it grew a few degrees warmer on his finger.<br />
<br />
The rest of the visiting football team soon followed suit after their QB, each becoming a Puma, but each becoming a color suited to their tastes.<br />
There were 11 others, half of them becoming metallic colors like their opposite number on the home team, brass, gold, silver, platinum, bronze and iron.  Of the other 6, two became camouflaged pattern, one in blues, one in green.  The remaining four became black, royal blue, orange, and white.  All of them shared the traits common to Synthetics, lack of genitalia, nipples, a navel-nozzle, and molding lines across their bodies.  Their whiskers looked like fishing line.  Casper noticed that a few of them had markings that looked a lot like tattoos, the royal blue puma-man having a silvery-white bar-code and a similarly colored barbed-wire armband standing out in his view the most.<br />
Most lost all their clothing, though a few still had jerseys or their team jackets still on.<br />
<br />
Casper was on a roll.  He turned his attention to the ladies the other team had brought with them.<br />
<br />
Again the ring grew warm as he changed them all at once.  He almost laughed aloud as they each became a busty bunny babe, the 11 of them cycling through the pastel colors, though one or two had more extreme colors, one of the ladies sporting a neon pink coloration with an electric blue underside, and apparently her sister, sporting the same colors, only reversed.  All 12 of them were very gifted in the chest department on account of Casper, though, like their brethren, none had nipples.  They lacked in the plumbing department as well, showing nothing but smooth rubber and molding lines in their most private places.  Clothing seemed to vanish for them as well, though a few kept purses, or bracelets, or a men&#39;s letter jacket, probably from their boyfriends on the football team.<br />
<br />
Casper had just increased the Synthetic population by another 24, bringing the total to 569, if his math was not incorrect.<br />
<br />
He hardly had time to contemplate his handiwork when the doorbell rang, and someone opened it.  Casper shot a bolt of invisible energy from the ring as soon as he saw the person on the other side, almost before he registered that there was a person there.<br />
The pizza delivery boy stood there, hefting his stack of extra-large pizzas, not even tipping or even seeming to notice as his clothes vanished.  His skin became shiny and smooth, darkening to a light grey, shape stretching and changing as his legs lengthened, his hips widened, and his chest began to expand.  His, now her hands became grey, changing to white on the fingers, as her feet underwent a similar color change, forming into paws. Her face pushed out into a feline shape, growing the now familiar plastic whiskers, as her ears began to lengthen, growing and surpassing what Casper thought was normal for a cat, pushing out further and further until they resembled rabbit ears.<br />
Bar-code, nozzle and molding lines appeared next, as the pizza boxes shimmered and changed, now food suitable for his kind, Casper had no doubt.  Like every female appearing Synthetic, this new one was completely sealed downstairs.  Casper marveled at the new woman, at her apparent combination of rabbit and feline features.  He recalled an foreign animated tv show from a few years back that had a character that was half cat, half rabbit, perhaps this boy-turned-woman was a fan, he thought.<br />
<br />
570, the ring informed him.<br />
<br />
Tommy re-appeared from the kitchen, carrying a wallet, calling out to Casper to help him with the pizzas, as he paid the pizza delivery girl.  She smiled and made a noise like &#39;nyaa!&#39; apparently unfazed by her sudden and somewhat extreme transformation.  As he walked the stack of pizzas back to the kitchen, Casper could smell them, and it was beginning to make his mouth water, or what ever it was that Synthetics did when hungry.  He could smell the odors of foam, plastics, latex and glue wafting from the stack, and his stomach, or at least his approximation of one, growled.  He put the pizzas down on the kitchen table as directed by Tommy, ready to dig in, as he was sure everyone else at the party was as well.</p>
