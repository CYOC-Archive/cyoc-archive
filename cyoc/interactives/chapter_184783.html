<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as she was wandering around the mall&#39;s busy hallways, it struck Terri just how much more at ease she was compared to the last time she&#39;d been here. Normally the mall always made her antsy, all the people around, the crowds, it got her feeling so nervous that she was being judged by everyone who walked past. Now, though, as she strode towards the nearest store with fashions more appropriate to her altered body, she was reveling in it, adoring the feeling of everyone glancing and staring at her heavenly proportions.<br />
<br />
It had been her intent to beeline towards picking up some new outfits, something cute and sexy, but she quickly found herself getting distracted by just about every display she&#39;d passed. Her mission soon turned into aimless wandering, going in and out of different storefronts and very nearly buying something, before wandering back out as she struggled to remember her objective. The only thing that seemed to stick in her mind was that just about everything was too prudish, too covering. She needed to show off wayyyyy more if she was going to snag Aubrey&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
She was soon starting to wonder if they&#39;d have anything here suitable for her - and just as the idea was crossing her mind, she realized she had wandered into a familiar place. Bizarre concoctions lining the shelves, odd costumes that looked just a bit too lifelike, strange smells wafting in the air - this was the shop! The place that sold her the potion, the miracle responsible for making her an absolute bombshell! Oh, she just had to go and thank them, not to mention apologize profusely for all the doubt she&#39;d had!<br />
<br />
There was a thud as she rested her chest on the counter, expecting to see the old woman from before attending to it. Instead, Terri was met with a ruffled-looking young girl, no more than 18 or 19, with curly red hair, worried green eyes, and a sea of freckles on her skin. &quot;Oh, s-sorry ma&#39;am!&quot; she replied with alarm, her Irish accent impossible to miss. &quot;I&#39;m Niamh. Might there be somethin&#39; I can help ye find?&quot;<br />
<br />
Terri had to hold back a gasp - god, this girl was <i>soooooo</i> cute! She must have had a thing for redheads, with how much her heart fluttered just looking at her. &quot;Oh, I just wanted to thank you guys!&quot; She replied cheerfully, resting her chin in her hands as she stared right into the girl&#39;s big emerald eyes. &quot;The old lady here, she sold me this potion, and it took me from being a chubby bore to being <i>so</i> hot!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Irish girl&#39;s face turned pale. &quot;Oh shite.&quot; Frantically she started flipping through records in a drawer. &quot;Shite shite shite shite shite, you&#39;re Terri Zhang, right? Oh bloody - stupid stupid stupid, how could I forget?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Seeing this sudden change in demeanor, Terri quickly reached a hand out, caressing the girl&#39;s face without a second thought. The redhead momentarily paused in her search, shivering, before getting right back to flipping through documents, now rushing to throw them out until she finally arrived at what she was looking for. &quot;I was supposed to go and find ye before ye took it, and give ye something! Oh shite, oh shite, please don&#39;t be too late!&quot;<br />
<br />
Thoroughly confused, Terri could only watch in fascination as the girl rushed over to rifle through a nearby shelf, smiling as she admired the supple curvature of the girl&#39;s rear end. Sadly, the show came to an end as the girl practically tumbled from the shelf, now holding a black headband that looked like it would fit her head perfectly. Terri didn&#39;t even need to ask for help - the cutie marched right up to her and shoved it right onto her head without needing to be asked.<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, she found herself blinking, grasping at her head as something hummed and ached up there. &quot;I... uh... I...&quot; It felt like a fog was being forcibly lifted, and suddenly she was snapping back into a more usual state of mind. A bit less vapid, a bit smarter... and back to completely lacking in confidence, even as she looked down at her bombshell body. &quot;What... uh... what is... what did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Niamh ran a hand through her hair as she started pacing back and forth, trying to figure out how to explain. &quot;The potion ye took, it let ye gain the qualities of another girl, ye? Well, me dear Aunt Adie, she realized she never told ye that it&#39;d make ye take on their <i>mental</i> qualities too.&quot; She started rubbing her hands together anxiously. &quot;And accountin&#39; on how ye&#39;d be like to pluck an essence from a girl who ain&#39;t all there, and since ye&#39;d mentioned ye mind was ye greatest strength...&quot;<br />
<br />
It all clicked into place quite quickly. Anna was a complete airhead - not much of anything that didn&#39;t involve sex went on in her pretty little head. Which meant... she was hurtling right towards being a complete bimbo, dumb as a sack of bricks. It had already started to set in - but for the moment, it seemed to have been suppressed. &quot;The headband... does it...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll reverse the mental changes, and keep ye mind intact so long as ye wear it,&quot; Niamh explained with a nod. &quot;I was supposed to deliver it to ye, but me Aunt is out of town now, and I&#39;ve got so much work, and I just... I forgot, and... oh shite, I&#39;m so sorry, if ye hand&#39;t... if it had been too long...&quot; The tears were welling up as she admitted the true magnitude of her screwup. &quot;Oh please forgive me, I&#39;m so sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey, it&#39;s alright,&quot; Terri replied, patting the girl on the shoulder. As terrifying as the prospect of losing her intelligence might be, she could tell it was an honest mistake - and seeing how worked up Niamh was, she found herself compelled to give the girl a hug. The redhead was all to eager to embrace her... and rest her head right against Terri&#39;s consdierable bosom. She didn&#39;t even mind - it was kind of pleasant, having her rest her head there, even if the girl was sobbing.<br />
<br />
Now, though, she was faced with a conondrum. She couldn&#39;t spend the rest of her life wearing this headband. They had to find some sort of more permanent solution - but if the changes to her mind and body were intertwined, then a permanent fix might mean giving up this incredible beauty. And at the back of her mind was a thought that only worried her further: she had actually kind of <i>liked</i> drifting towards being an airhead, feeling confident, not burdered by constant anxiety. Aubrey might never fall for a dumb bimbo... would she?</p>
