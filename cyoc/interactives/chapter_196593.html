<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But then it hit me, why should I just allow the new me be this nerdy looking boy, I can change my body around make myself look better over time and maybe even being able to make myself a better than I was? <br />
<br />
I dropped there and then in to push-ups only being able to do 5 but new I needed to do them, I&#39;m going to start doing them every day and went straight in to doing sit-ups doing 15, but stopped being out of breath and feeling sweat everywhere, and I called it for the night, knowing that it was not that much but with a body like this, I guess my body now, and only being 13 now I am going to need to build up to doing more and more, and I went to bed. <br />
<br />
Next morning I got out of bed and went straight into doing more push ups once again and managed to do 6 with my now twig arms and went down stairs seeing my new mom and got a boule of curial and sat opposite her and said I wanted to start wearing contact lenses, she looked at me and agreed that, it might be good for you to change up yourself and then said I will talk to your ophthalmologist, I thanked her and gave her a hug wanting to have a good relationship with my new parents this time around, not being that close to my parents the first time around. <br />
<br />
After talking to my mom for 5 minuets, having to doge some questions what I did not know what/how to answer the question, and headed for the school bus what I have not been on for years, school was what I expected, no real friend and treated like I am invisible, but this is how the old Nick wanted to live his life, I wanted to change this and signed up for soccer and swimming after school clubs, why them well for one I was pretty good at soccer the first time I was this age and swimming because it supposable very good for you. <br />
<br />
Once I got home my new mom gave me a box with contacts in saying I managed to get them today so surprise, I thanked her and decided to put them on now and my mom helped me look how to do it, once it was done it did feel Uncomfortable, but I heard by other people that it can take some time to get use to them, and looked in the mirror and well I did look better, but I still need a hear cut and can get some skin cream to clear up my face to look much nicer. <br />
<br />
So that is what I did, I carried on doing the exercise’s every morning and evening, went to soccer, what I started of being pretty bad at but after two weeks of going to the clubs and practising at home every night I caught up to be an average playing and even became friends with most of the team, swimming was kind of similar but I could not practise at home not having a pool, but I made a friend (Colin) who helped me to get better by staying one hour after are class/club and helped me improve, and Colin and me started to hang out more, he was in the same year at school as me and was in a lot of my classes  and he soon became my best friend, I also managed to get a nice hear cut in the weekend being Nick and managed to talk my parents into spending a reasonable amount of money on some good face cream to get rid of the extreme acne. <br />
<br />
And after a two month looking myself in the mirror was like looking at a completely different person, I now had baggy and saft looking blond hair, my face looked smooth and soft and not coved in acne anymore, my eye don’t even feel the contacts anymore, and all of thar left a cute looking face now with stylish hair, my body did not look scrawny anymore and I even had a lot of small but showable muscles, I even had much more normal cloths now what now shows of my muscular arms what I got from doing push ups, what I can do 70 now, and swing has really helped me with stamina and helped me get a 4 pack going on a 6 pack, I even have showable abs, I even have a Group of good friends but Colin is still my best friend who comes over every night to hang out, he is as close as a brother to me and I find myself being able to trust him with anything, I even spend a lot of time with my new parents and I can see that Thay are happier with the new me, and seem less stressed and happier knowing that I have friends now and that I am normally happy whenever they see me, and being a kid again has not really affected me, I have felt just right being a kid again from the start,  and it feel like a lot of off weight be taken off of me. <br />
<br />
And well, that is really life for me now, I would say it is a good life but a lot can still happing, I still need to find a person I can share my life with, and if the socks ever come back into my new life, being the course for my new life and having to make this life mine, I don’t know if I would even use them anymore but who knows? <br />
<br />
The End... </p>
