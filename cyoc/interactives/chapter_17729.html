<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark Gianci, a University freshman back in town for Spring Break walked into the Barbershop, not knowing what was going to happen to him today. At the same time, Julian Somori, a geeky-looking Latino teen who was really obsessed with Gianci to the point of Gianci having to put a restraining order against him, entered the Barbershop for a haircut.<br />
<br />
The Barber looked at the two men and noticed definite potential here.<br />
<br />
Yeah, definite potential...<br />
<br />
Gianci didn't notice Somori, mainly because he had become an adept in the art of ignoring him, so he went to the Barber and asked for a Marine haircut, because he wanted to 'feel more like a man'.<br />
<br />
The Barber nodded and said, &quot;When this is over, you will feel brand new.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he put the sheet around Mark's neck. He took the scissors out and began to cut Mark's hair, seemingly cutting the dark brown from it. By the time he was done, Mark's marine cut was dark red.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about a shave?&quot; the Barber asked Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be great,&quot; Mark answered in a deeper tone than his own, muscles developing smoothly under the sheet.<br />
<br />
The small electric razor got turned on, and so was Mark... no, Marc, now, as his name was Marco.<br />
<br />
He was taller than before, his body had got rid of all his baby fat, and begun to put on some years of age.<br />
<br />
In fact, with every swipe of the razor, Marc was looking more and more older, until the Barber rinsed the shaving cream from his face and his aging stopped at the ripe old age of 28, red stubble replacing his previous dark brown one.<br />
<br />
If someone had looked under the sheet, would have noticed Marc getting big all over, from his dick, who had grown 2 inches and now slapped nicely against his bellybutton when hard - and came complete with bigger balls, to his feet, now encased in sport shoes. His brown trousers had changed into blue jeans, which hugged his bubble fuzzy butt and hairy muscled legs quite nicely.<br />
<br />
His chest had gotten some improvement; washboard abs, and hard pecs, which surprisingly didn't look freaky; in fact, they made him look just  even more like a normal guy. His body hair had slowly changed coloration, from jet black to red.<br />
<br />
The Barber removed the sheet, and Marc stood up, all 6'4'' of him, with a gray wife-beater  - which did little to hide his magnificent physique - and the form-hugging blue jeans on, red hair quite visible under his sweat-soaked armpits and on his forearms and poking out from his ankles.<br />
<br />
He had a Celtic bracelet tattoo on both biceps, and on his ankles, too.<br />
<br />
His hands became rough and calloused, while his eyes had stayed the same (never repair what isn't broken).<br />
<br />
The back hair he had before had completely disappeared, leaving smooth skin to showcase the lean musculature, as his arms (minus the forearms) had. Marc's heritage, though, stood the same, as did his identity.<br />
<br />
But the memories changed; he had enrolled in the Marines right after High School, and stayed (going to College to major in Law) until an accident had made him unfit to stay in the Marines.<br />
<br />
He had gotten an Honorable discharge and now worked as a penal lawyer in a firm in town, without stopping living by some basic Marine rules.<br />
<br />
In a way, though, he had been glad to leave the USM. During one of the shipping out 'in the company of men', the red-haired italoamerican had found out something important about himself; he was gay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see?&quot; he asked Somori, who was almost agape in front of the strawberry-haired stud.<br />
<br />
Somori just gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much is it?&quot; the new and improved Marc Gianci asked the Barber.<br />
<br />
&quot;The usual.&quot; the Barber said. Marc took out the money and sat on a chair, finding a porn comic and beginning to read it, just for kicks.<br />
<br />
He was smiling broadly within the first 5 pages.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, my, do straight guys have a lot of fantasy.&quot; Marc said, his left ankle resting on his right knee, looking impossibly classy.<br />
<br />
The Barber chuckled as he pulled the sheet around Julian's neck, and began his work.<br />
<br />
He cut Julian's hair the way he 'always' wanted it, at a normal boys' hair length, and by pulling his jet black hair lightened to a light brown.<br />
<br />
His eyes changed in color, from brown to green, and his face got squarer, as his heritage changed from Hispanic to Irish.<br />
<br />
Brown stubble made its appearance on the tanned Irish face, while the body underneath changed as well.<br />
<br />
In a few seconds, the barber had finished the cut, removed the sheet and left Julian to look at himself.<br />
<br />
The young Latino was gone, and in its place there was a tanned, muscled, hairy man of Irish descent, with a nice looking brown beard, and dressed in a white sleeveless t-shirt, white socks, tennis shoes and a salopette, all items of clothing chosen carefully.<br />
<br />
And don't think the cock was neglected. The thing had become 8 inches, and as his lover's did, slapped against his belly quite nicely when hard, which was most of the time, with low-hanging balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bobby?&quot; Marc asked, a little annoyed. &quot;Are you finished with showing off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will when you'll look up from that stupid comic.&quot; was the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make me,&quot; Marc teased, looking up from the comic, his eyes gleaming mischievously.<br />
<br />
Bobby did not need a repeating, as he went directly to his lover's fly and opened it, taking his hardening cock out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Robert Theodore Stoyver, damn it, control yourself! We aren't alone!&quot; Marc said in a strangled voice.<br />
<br />
But it was too late; Bobby had already put Marc's hard prick in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what I like the most about you?&quot; Bobby managed to say while sucking on Marc's cock like it was a lollipop (well, the man DOES look like a very sexy piece of candy, Bobby thought).<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?&quot; Marc said, his orgasm getting nearer and nearer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're 100% natural, not circumcised.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... aren't... either...&quot; Marc said. &quot;Oh, God, Oh... Bobby, I'm going to come,... Bobby, oh... BOBBY!&quot; Marc screamed his lover's name as he came - hard.<br />
<br />
Bobby tried to swallow as much as he could, then licked Marc's now-spent prick like it was a Chupa-Chups candy (Here we go again with the candy references, Bobby thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, what a ride.&quot; Marc said, a hazed expression in his face, while Bobby tucked his dick back inside the jeans, and thanked God he had decided to go smokeless, today. &quot;C'mere.&quot; he then said to Bobby, pulling him in for a kiss.<br />
<br />
The Barber watched in silence his latest accomplishment, and was startled when a cell phone rang, to the tune of REM's 'Great Beyond'.<br />
<br />
Marc blushed, which made him look more like a strawberry than usual, and answered his phone &quot;Gianci. Yeah?... Oh, man... are you sure? I mean, I don't want any more cold showers... what do you mean? That's it?... YES!... OK, I'll call you. And thank you, for everything.&quot; he then hung up and looked at Bobby, letting his happy and dancing brown eyes meet Bobby's confused green ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;They accepted our request. Dan is going to stay with us.&quot; Marc said, happy beyond belief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, we're gonna be Fathers!!&quot; Bobby said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Marc said, &quot;biologically speaking, I already am.&quot; Daniele 'Dan' Gianci was Marc's son from a fling he had before after he had broken with his last boyfriend and meeting Bobby, four years before, and stayed with his mother, though Marc was always there to help, and Deborah, Dan's mother, had no qualms about her kid's dad being in the boy's life, as a lot of single mothers out there seemed to have.<br />
<br />
Sadly, though, she had died in a car accident two months before, and her parents, who by the way were bigoted, wanted the full custody of Dan, and Marc knew it wasn't for emotional reasons.<br />
<br />
It had been a long hard battle, but ultimately, they had won.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sense of humor is quite obvious you know?&quot; Bobby said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you'll forgive me, because you love me so.&quot; Marc said, jokingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man, you're my Marc-berry.&quot; he said, while getting up and paying for the haircut.<br />
<br />
Then they left, not before saying a heartfelt 'Thank you' at the Barber, who was going to face one of the biggest challenges in his life, when two teenage girls decided to enter the Barbershop...</p>
