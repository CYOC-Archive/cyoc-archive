<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiden lay on top of Mark&#39;s broad, pillowy chest for a while, both men basking in the afterglow of their lovemaking. The dense fur on Mark&#39;s chest felt warm and soft and comforting to Aiden, and he absent-mindedly twirled the thick hair around his fingertips. Mark opened his eyes and looked down lovingly at Aiden.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, though, it was time to get out of bed and get cleaned up. Aiden went and took a shower first, using the time alone under the hot water to get acquainted with his new assets. As he lathered up, he ran his hands down across his flat stomache, then over his wide hips. Sure, he still had mostly a man&#39;s body, but his figure had changed a bit to accomodate his new female genitals. He reached back with both hands to feel his new big bubble butt again. Wow. It felt huge. But that wasn&#39;t all that felt huge. Aiden reached up and squeezed his new tits. They were amazingly big and round and squishy to him. Aiden jumped up and down for a few seconds just to feel the weight of his breasts flounce up and down.<br />
<br />
When he was done showering, Aiden came out and toweled off, instinctively wrapping the towel around his chest instead of his waist, like a woman would. As the towel rubbed against his sensitive nipples, he felt jolts of pleasure. Aiden wondered if he would ever get used to that. He came back out of the bathroom to find Mark sitting on the edge of the bed, a handsome smirk on his bearded face. &quot;God, he looks huge,&quot; Aiden thought, admiring Mark&#39;s bulky frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;My turn in the shower, you go on and get dressed babe,&quot; Mark said, heading towards the bathroom now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we going out?&quot; Aiden asked, suddenly a bit concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we need to run some errands,&quot; Mark answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhmmm....what am I supposed to wear, I doubt my old clothes are going to accomodate....these,&quot; Aiden said, looking down at the globes on his chest. They were heavy, and they bounced around as he walked. It wasn&#39;t very comfortable.<br />
<br />
Mark laughed in his deep voice. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, the Chronivac took care of our wardrobes. Check it out for yourself!&quot; Then Mark headed into the shower and turned on the water.<br />
<br />
Curious, Aiden headed over to his dress and opened some of the drawers. His eyes widened in surprise. It was true. Gone were all of his old boxers and briefs. Instead, he found a selection of women&#39;s underwear, panties, and thongs. In the next drawer, he found a number of bras. There sports bra looking ones for working out, and sexy, lacy ones like women&#39;s lingerie, and some kind of neutral looking ones in solid colors.<br />
Aiden was feeling anxious, but still curious. He tried on a red thong and slid the undergarment up his normal, male-looking legs and then pulled it tight over his pussy and up to his hips. He could feel the fabric stretch up between his round ass cheeks. It didn&#39;t feel bad, he decided.<br />
<br />
Next, Aiden selected a matching red bra that didn&#39;t look too scandalous. He didn&#39;t know what he was doing at first, but figured out how the thing worked. Aiden headed over to the full-length mirror resting against the wall and checked himself out. He was torn, experiencing a mixture of conflicting emotions. Part of him loved what he saw. The underwear definitely looked sexy on him. Any man would want to fuck him. The other part of him felt a bit humiliated and emasculated. The bra supported his new breasts, which was great, but it also made them look super pronounced and they stuck out so far from his chest. And his nipples! They could still be seen through the bra. There was no denying the truth: these tits were going to be the first part of him that entered a room from now on.<br />
<br />
As Aiden went about looking for a pair of jeans and a top, Mark finished up and joined him in the bedroom. &quot;Mhmmmmmm,&quot; he growled, &quot;Honey, you look hot!&quot; Mark&#39;s long cock swung back and forth like a pendulum between his thighs, and the sight of Aiden in a thong and bra was making him hard again. He distracted himself by getting dressed. Mark removed a jockstrap with a blue pouch and pulled it up over his package. Then, he struggled to put on a clean, white wifebeater. His chest and back looked huge in it, and his thick chest hair spilled over the top. Mark noted that his new bigger nips continued to poke out, tenting the fabric over each pec. Next, Mark put on a pair of worn-looking jeans. This part was a bit of a struggle, causing Aiden to giggle. Mark&#39;s furry, muscular ass barely fit as he tugged the waist up and over his cheeks. In the front, his big bulge was obvious. He buckled his belt and looked to see how his pussyboy was doing.<br />
<br />
Aiden fared alot better with his jeans. They were all cut a bit more like a women&#39;s pair now, wider in the hips and stretchy to cover his big bottom. Next, he pulled on a scoop-neck tshirt. It was a bit tight, showing off his slim build and muscular arms. He didn&#39;t mind that. But it was scary that he could see his cleavage. His tits would be on full display.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, there&#39;s no way I can go out like this!&quot; Aiden said, staring at his reflection. &quot;What are people going to think when they see me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck &#39;em!&quot; Mark said gruffly. &quot;Who cares what they think! All that matters is that we&#39;re happy, right?&quot; Mark asked, coming up behind Aiden and massaging his boy&#39;s shoulders encouragingly. &quot;Now, c&#39;mon, let&#39;s get going!&quot; Mark announced, smacking Aiden&#39;s ass and causing him to give a little yelp. Mark looked great, sure, but Aiden continue to dwell on his new features. Was this really what he wanted?</p>
