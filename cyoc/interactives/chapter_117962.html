<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Staring at the sleeping form on the king sized bed; Lance couldn’t help but growl protectively. His were-tigress wife fast asleep in a matching set of silk blue pajamas. Lila was in her human form as she was now entering the second trimester of her pregnancy. Pushing four months since Lance found out he was going to be a father; the were-panther remembered fondly when he and Lila had their wedding. A sudden affair; with his parents, his brother Benton and Amanda. For Lila; her brother Rick and his wife Ester was present. Along with their cubs, Cindy Jasper and Yogi.<br />
<br />
“A January wedding,” Lance smiling; removing his clothes and shifting into his were-panther Fursona. Placing a black furred paw on Lila’s belly; Lance gently rubs the ever pronounced baby bump. Purring approvingly as his tail twitches happily; a swelling of pride with in him as his mate is carrying his offspring.<br />
“Arnold or Cathy,” Lance removing his paw from Lila; “Who will you be five months from now?”<br />
Knowing he won’t get an answer; Lance quietly walks over to his side of the bed and climbs in. While Lila was sleeping under the covers; Lance didn’t need to while in his fursona. Yet that didn’t stop him as snuggled next to his wife. His fur brushing up against the silk pajamas as he gently wrapped his arms around Lila. While Lila was still fast asleep; Lance’s mere presence in bed caused her to start rumbling happily in her sleep as she automatically adjusted herself to be closer to her husband. It wasn’t long until Lance was soon fast asleep as well.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“Did you clean up your mess,” Benton hears as he enters the master bedroom of his estate; Seeing Amanda not in bed, the were-panther swivels his ears and hears her in the washroom.<br />
“No,” Benton being sarcastic; “I made it bigger and left it for Ethel to deal with tomorrow morning.”<br />
“Oh really,” Amanda leaving the bathroom; looking at Benton’s grinning muzzle as she knew he was lying through his sharp teeth. “You want to try again?”<br />
“Why,” Benton climbing into bed; “this game is fun.”<br />
“Well you’re in the mood,” Amanda looking at her husband and his feline member clearly poking up from his sheathe. “A few minutes ago you were ready to rip up the kitchen; now you have a dopey smile and leaking pre-cum. What changed?”<br />
<br />
“I had a talk with Frieda as she laid waste to the leftover Tuna salad,” Benton placing a paw on Amanda’s side of the bed; patting the bed as a not so subtle way to have Amanda approach. “Now let’s not spend this moment talking,” Benton growling; “let’s spend it making a cub.”<br />
<br />
Benton woke up from the dream he obviously just had; visibly shaken and still un-nerved from a few hours prior. Looking at his phone on the nearby nightstand and seeing its only one in the morning; Benton sighs as he lays his head back down on bed. Remembering when he went to bed; Amanda was already in bed waiting for him, while he used the washroom to pour himself a glass of water to take his medication with. Still upset after finding out what Jack Crawford was trying to do; Benton never said a word to Amanda as he climbed into bed. Shaking his head as he wasn’t in the mood to talk; Benton spent a few minutes awake in bed after Amanda turned off the lights and started to go to sleep.<br />
<br />
“What a weird dream,” Benton thinking to himself; “why would I have that?”<br />
“Go back to sleep,” Amanda mumbles as she tosses in bed; draping an arm across Benton’s furry chest.<br />
“Frieda did eat the tuna salad,” Benton thinking to himself; “I know that part was real. But why make that comment about making a cub?”<br />
Benton&#39;s mind continued to wander until he started to feel his eyes getting heavy; knowing he was feeling sleepy, the were-panther didn’t fight the desire but instead let unconsciousness claim him just as Amanda moves in bed again; only to get closer and snuggle with him.<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
Sitting in his private office in his Seattle condo; Jack Crawford was busy nursing a scotch and soda as he sent his emails to a few rich business associates regarding putting down roots in Moon Lake. All of the recipients of his emails were normal and wealthy like he was. Smiling as he finished off his drink before getting up; the conniving were-panther headed back to bed, confident of his victory over the supposedly all power elder council of Moon Lake; unaware of Lance Knight’s damming expose over him and Kenya being farmed out to every major newspaper on the west coast as well as the Wall Street journal and other media outlets.<br />
<br />
As far as Jack was concerned, he couldn’t be touched. Confident that Moon Lake will be scrambling to deal with the media trolling the town in regards to Frederick Parker’s arrest; Jack couldn’t help but chuckle as he happily observed his wife sleeping. Pleased that she finally settled down with the desire to be rutted into next year; Kenya’s heat cycle to be blamed as far as Jack was concerned. Not that the were-panther wasn’t complaining with all the sex he was having; Jack was however thankful that Kenya slept rather soundly after sex. It allowed him to catch up on business after she passed out from the bliss of being filled with his hot were-panther seed. Climbing into bed and making sure to envelope her, Jack purrs as he wraps his arms around Kenya’s furry body; making sure his paws hold and cradle Kenya’s belly.<br />
<br />
“I really don’t care if you took your birth control or not,” Jack speaks as he settles down to spooning his sleeping wife; “we have centuries to enjoy each other, cubs or no cubs.”<br />
Jack knew Kenya didn’t hear what he said as she was fast asleep. Letting himself settle, Jack was soon joining Kenya in a restful slumber.</p>
