<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At a steady pace with his new look, Miles reached the kitchen to find what looked to be the start of a porno. James was facing away with only a plain plaid apron on, his juicy glutes and shield of a back on full display, humming a simple tune while flipping the omelette again, satisfied with its progress and sliding it onto a plate.<br />
<br />
Moving over to get a fresh pitcher of juice before going back to get the plate, James turned around to see Miles wide eyed and bright red with his shoulders tight and his tights tighter against his hardon. The popup tent blew past James&#39;s focus though, being more focused on Miles&#39;s makeover.<br />
<br />
The styled hair, the strong posture, the form fitting workout gear. Any hint of the shy spineless fairy that had lived in that body up till recently was currently buried under a few hundred pounds of beef. The man in the doorway was a confident self respecting power bottom of a twink who was driving all of that aforementioned beef crazy with the thought that that was his boyfriend. Boyfriend and.... boss.....<br />
<br />
&quot;B...Brunch is ready,&quot; James finally said, stepping over to give him a kiss, squeezing him close. Miles stumbled and shivered in the kiss before exhaling and giggling. &quot;And I.... I see you made some eggs too, sir,&quot; he managed to get out, heating up and biting his lip.<br />
<br />
James took a bit to get the joke before snorting and letting Miles go, taking a lemon slice from the counter and squeezing it over his glutes for Miles to oggle. In lock step Miles didn&#39;t hesitate to squat and give James&#39;s exposed ass a good bite and suck, lapping up the lemon juice.<br />
<br />
Sneering and flinching in surprise before looking back, James raised a brow. &quot;B...babe, I know we just got started but we can&#39;t have sex all weekend,&quot; he said, the cockiness he&#39;d managed getting sucked up with the lemon juice. &quot;Why not?&quot; was all Miles could ask after having gotten a good mouthful, winking up at his top.<br />
<br />
He was only partly joking what with already of the mind to get carried back to bed by James. However right he was and however much Miles Wright the CEO and James O&#39;Deorain the intern needed to be preparing for, Miles the thirsting bottom and James the stud of an Olympian had not even come close to their limits and needs from the other after coming clean on their feelings.<br />
<br />
As there were already conclusions foregone of them not switching back for some amount of time or them needing to get some form of a plan worked out, the last time they&#39;d had sex that day was not going to be the last time they&#39;d be having sex that day.<br />
<br />
&quot;B... because....&quot; James twisted his face and tried to think. Miles smirked this time and took a grip through the apron, both to distract and to get another serving of meat. Even if he&#39;d had that cock his whole life he still couldn&#39;t get over how big James was, the junk and the muscles and that gorgeous moan coming from him in response. James conversely felt better from the fondling, tucking down while his body quickly started chubbing up in Miles&#39;s grip.<br />
<br />
Miles teased his boyfriend for just a bit longer before going up on his toes to give him a kiss and sit down at the table where brunch had been set, studying it for a bit. &quot;We uh... we got much more?&quot; he asked, already taking a few bites.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y... yeah, though I thought... I mean... guessing you&#39;re used to eating more, but-&quot; James started to say, Miles holding up a fork to interrupt. &quot;No I know, I think your body needs a bit more than this so we can start getting it heavier,&quot; Miles said, forking down the omelette while standing back up to resume the cooking, leaving James a bit puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heavier?&quot; he asked, not completely following while Miles got started on another. &quot;Sure. Figured from how well you&#39;re taking to all those pounds that you&#39;d be good with both of us gettin&#39; big. Gonna take awhile but I&#39;ve still got all the habits that I need to be getting you on now too. Need to keep my man big while I&#39;m catching up and all,&quot; Miles was listing off idly, focusing on more meal prep while James processed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Catching....&quot; he trailed off, starting to make the connection, Miles turning his head and winking at him, getting a blush. &quot;Give it a decade, we&#39;ll be the biggest pair of bears in the business,&quot; Miles said, smirking at James who was starting to heat up at the visual.<br />
<br />
Miles had guessed right. Whatever bodies either of them were in, his boyfriend had a similar type and taste for big men, so big men they would be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Course if you can&#39;t wait we can just call Vince back and leave him in this lightweight,&quot; Miles said as a joke, getting James&#39;s attention back to reality where he twisted his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;N... no, that.. no,&quot; he said, looking to the side with his voice dropping a bit. Miles picked up on the change in tone, turning his head back to see James sulking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; he started, taking the second omelette off the pan before stepping over to brush James&#39;s face and look him in the eye. &quot;Just joking. We don&#39;t have to do any more switching for now,&quot; he said, trying to give James a smile.<br />
<br />
James took his hand, wanting a bit of comfort and nodding. He wasn&#39;t sure why that had put him off as much as it had. Or why Miles was being so much more empathic and insightful. Maybe unearthing his submissive streak was bringing up other emotions along with it?<br />
<br />
Miles meanwhile was regretting his quip a bit the more he chewed on it. He&#39;d only meant to make a joke out of how fast and loose they&#39;d been using the ring, but the longer he thought he realized how he&#39;d effectively said James&#39;s old body was disposable. Not what he&#39;d meant in the slightest, nor was he sure if that was what James was currently thinking but keeping and building it seemed all the more important now.<br />
<br />
Taking a step away to pick the new omelette back up, Miles gave James a smile and forked the extra meal down in spite of the full feeling he&#39;d already started getting during brunch before returning to him to give him a kiss.<br />
<br />
James was initially slow in the new kiss but eventually warmed back up and smiled, wrapping Miles in a bear hug and lifting him up, getting the bottom to wheeze his lungs out. He&#39;d be getting big again in the long haul but it was still so much of a rush to feel so small and weak in comparison to James. When he wasn&#39;t putting the powerful domineering breeding bull bit on he was still a big cuddly teddy bear which was beyond adorable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have to admit though you topping Vince has crossed my mind more than once,&quot; Miles admitted, stepping out of the hug. James frowned a bit and tilted his head like a confused dog. &quot;I mean we.... we weren&#39;t dating... then....&quot; James said slowly, clearly still a bit embarrassed by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I&#39;m not mad, I&#39;m.... to be honest I&#39;m actually kinda turned on by it,&quot; Miles explained, getting James to tuck his head back in a bit of surprise. Miles only smiled back and shrugged, giving James&#39;s pec a pinch where it was peeking out through the apron, getting a flinch from him. &quot;Learning new things by the hour I guess,&quot; Miles attempted, not really having the best explanation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y... you want me to... fuck other guys?&quot; James tried to verbalize, his eyes going back and forth in processing. Miles gave a snort this time and slapped James&#39;s beefy leg, getting him to jump a bit in alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the visual of you getting dominant. Owning more people and using them for yourself while knowing I&#39;m your favorite. Your personal bottom and only one out of all them that gets to actually have you. Makes me feel special, being such a big guy&#39;s lil&#39; guy, even if the little part doesn&#39;t stick over the years,&quot; Miles said, leaning in and pulling James&#39;s arm around him. James was just heating up, awkward and quiet but not necessarily able to disagree either.<br />
<br />
&quot;And even if I&#39;ve gotten in faster touch with my body I also know yours after three plus decades of it. Just as I&#39;ve got my new needs now you&#39;ll have yours and... I don&#39;t know, I like that. My man going around getting everyone in the tri-state area bred up is hot,&quot; Miles tried to explain and figure out at the same time.<br />
<br />
James wasn&#39;t sure if he agreed though he was also focusing more on how Miles had referred to each other&#39;s bodies, taking the smaller one for himself and listing the big beefy build as being his. And he swallowed nervously because of how much he liked hearing that. Miles may have in fact been right, and whether or not James had fully linked with it his body was going to demand the openness that its old owner was now asking him for.<br />
<br />
The thought of becoming someone else scared James to some extent, but Miles... still seemed like himself? Submissiveness or otherwise he was still the man he was falling for and had been doing so for the past few months in spite of the reputation office romances had. Whether he was pitching or catching Miles was still the cocky male taking up that cute little butt he loved stretching out for himself now.<br />
<br />
And in that vein just as Miles wouldn&#39;t have so much as thought about bottoming, James had no questions or hesitation about being the pure blooded top now between the two of them. Penetrating and pumping this smug little fairy in his grip was about all James was interested in.<br />
<br />
Some work with toys would probably help his climax and load and he was definitely more open to playing with his new butt than Miles ever would have been but.... he was really only thinking about that in service of being an even better top. Giving his prostate some work and he&#39;d be reaching porn star levels.<br />
<br />
James could fill Miles up more and even more, and whenever he&#39;d need a break James could see how far and how much his meat could fire. The sight of Miles on his front naked in bed, smiling and oozing more of his cum as he got busy pumping out more just got James more excited. He wanted to top and he wanted to push himself.<br />
<br />
He was a bear and a bull able to dominate any man and everyone needed to know personally just as he needed everyone to know what his slutty little twink knew by heart and by what he was confident was going to be a daily soreness. Least for however long it took for their parts to get better adjusted for each other, getting James to smirk. He wanted his man&#39;s insides to know when he was there that night. Even in a different body that tight little bussy still belonged to him.<br />
<br />
With that in mind though James still felt like himself in spite of his change in energy and priorities. But then maybe all of that had always been there, it had just never had the fertile hormone saturated beefed out soil it had needed to to grow within him.<br />
<br />
Maybe... James just needed to be doing his own self discovery. He wasn&#39;t opposed to keeping up Miles&#39;s hookup streak, it just felt a bit odd while being in a very real relationship. He wasn&#39;t sure how into voyeurism he was, having never dwelled on the matter much.<br />
<br />
But getting a look in the mirror to see the huge tanned bear looking back he... definitely looked like the type. Not just the sort that would want to but the sort of man that would almost need to have a room full of men and.... and.........<br />
<br />
James frowned some at the visual of the imaginary harem. Men. Miles was bi whereas he&#39;d been a solid six on the Kinsey scale. He&#39;d have thought in picking up on the state Miles had left that body in that maybe he&#39;d have started noticing women but... no. He still only wanted men. Thin men like the one he was dating, big men like the one he was now, fat men, tall men, short men, young men, old men, it was all still about men.<br />
<br />
Even as a bear among bears he was still as straight as a circle apparently. And going over this matter actually comforted him by some amount. He was still himself. He just had way more testosterone to work with now. As well as a babe of a twink on his arm and in his bed, whom he turned to and pulled up into a kiss.<br />
<br />
Not expecting it but not resisting it either, Miles yelped quietly in a bit of surprise before kissing back and getting his arms over James&#39;s shoulders, feeling warm and pleased by the response. &quot;Is.... is that a yes?&quot; he asked when the kiss eventually broke. &quot;It&#39;s not a no. I just need a bit of time to think. And maybe a bit of warming up,&quot; James answered, rubbing his forehead to Miles&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll need to make sure no other tops go around snatching you from me,&quot; he said with a bit of seduction, giving Miles a squeeze who shivered and groaned. There was that aggression, Miles heated up and brought a hand to James&#39;s pec to squeeze it. For however serious he was being then Miles could feel just how much James&#39;s growing dominance and aggression were resonating with his well fleshed out submissiveness and drive to be handled and used.<br />
<br />
It was almost poetic. However much either of them lost in the exchange, what they both were gaining and growing into was exactly what the other man was in need of and lusting after. They were both stiff and poking through their clothes, clearly already thinking about round four.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you... want to go out somewhere or...&quot; James tried to articulate, trying to talk over inherent groans in his chest, holding Miles close. Miles was at the point where James&#39;s pec was like a stress ball, his hands squeezing them more often than not at this point.</p>
