<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The school already sent us the information about where to go and to which class we belong, and comparing information we were happy to discover that we belonged to the same class.<br />
<br />
Entering the school, I could see that it was newer and more well maintained than my old one.  From what I was told, it is more expensive as well , luckily the facility is covering the costs.<br />
<br />
The first classes were just discussing the syllabus and meeting everyone and when the lunch bell rang, I went with Hana to the cafeteria to eat.<br />
<br />
The food at the cafeteria looked delicious and since the lunch plan was already paid by the facility, it was technically free as well<br />
<br />
I sat in the same table with Hana and started to eat my meal with relish<br />
<br />
“Dahlia, I was thinking… if you haven’t decided to join another school club, would you like to try cheerleading with me?” Hana asked hesitantly <br />
<br />
I had to think for a moment, I had this image in my mind that the cheerleader team was where mean girls meet, but I knew that reality was different from movie stereotypes and trying something new was exactly what I wanted right now.<br />
<br />
“Sure, but how do we join? Should we just go and say that we want to be part of the team?”<br />
<br />
“We would probably need to pass the tryouts; in my last school they held them at the end of January” she said while trying to cut a piece of chicken<br />
<br />
“That’s fine, but I really don’t know anything about cheerleading, I may not pass the tryouts” I said worriedly<br />
<br />
“If you want I can teach you, you can come to my house to practice together” she replied cheerfully.<br />
<br />
“Sure!” I exclaimed, and thought to myself that I already had a new friend.<br />
<br />
                                                                                                          *********************<br />
<br />
After eating lunch I started to feel the telltale pressure that signaled I needed to pee, maybe I could withstand it for a while…but no, I had to do this sooner or later, better do it now.<br />
<br />
“Hana, I need to go to the bathroom” I said and stood up<br />
<br />
“Ok” she said and started following me<br />
<br />
I continued my way to the bathroom like normal, but inside I was a little shocked. That’s right, unlike boys,  girls often go to the bathroom together. I just didn’t expect this to happen to me on the first day.<br />
<br />
As I got closer to the bathroom and saw the girl’s door, I started to feel reluctant to enter. I already started to consider myself a girl, but I have spent years thinking of the girl’s bathroom as a forbidden zone. Nonetheless, with Hana behind me, I couldn’t show any doubts now, so I just opened the door and entered.<br />
<br />
The first difference I noticed from the boys bathroom was the sanitary products dispenser fixed to the wall. I hopefully wouldn’t  need to use that for a while longer. I noticed that the products were not for free, but you had to pay for them… well I guess If they were for free, younger kids would just take a bunch to play with them or something<br />
<br />
I was walking slowly while appraising the bathroom. I didn’t want to stop unnaturally and be awkward. <br />
<br />
I noticed an older girl washing her hands, she looked at us and I prepared myself for receiving a tongue lashing for entering the girl’s bathroom, but she just turned her gaze away and continued her business.<br />
<br />
Holding a sigh of relief, I walked toward the stalls and discovered that there weren&#39;t any urinals anywhere, obviously girl’s wouldn&#39;t have any use for them. If I wanted to use a urinal with my current girl part’s… well it wouldn&#39;t be impossible, but it would be a very messy affair. With the lack of urinals I also discovered that the usual pungent smell of pee that I usually associated with school bathrooms was also missing, a welcome difference.<br />
<br />
I entered one stall and Hana entered the one next to me. Inside I found the normal toilet and a small metal bin on one side, this was not just a normal trash bin, but a sanitary bin. Mariah had shown me pictures and explained that when the time comes, I should dispose of my sanitary products in one of those; I could use a regular trash bin as well, but I should never throw them down the toilet <br />
<br />
The walls of the stall were clean, no drawings of dicks nor offensive messages, but I believe the difference is not because it’s the girls bathroom, but because this school is better maintained than my old one. I bet they even repainted the walls before classes started.<br />
<br />
I started to undo my belt and the buttons of my shorts so I could pull them down and do my business; I have already gotten used to pee as a girl, but only now by using a school bathroom I noticed how complicated the whole process is compared to when I was a man. Before, I only had to open the zipper, take my dick out, pee in the urinal, shake the penis, put it back, and close the zipper. Now I am just pulling my shorts down and feel that it’s taking too long; I cannot even want to think how long would it take for a more complex attire.<br />
<br />
As my shorts slide down my legs and reach my feet, I stand there with my pussy and ass bare and start to feel a little bit exposed and cannot help to think how embarrassing it would be if somebody suddenly were to open the door. I give a quick glance to the lock to make sure it remains closed and before I sit down I remember to check for toilet paper; fortunately the roll is almost new.<br />
<br />
“ppsssssss” I suddenly hear the sound of pee hitting water coming from the stall next to me revealing that Hana is already peeing. <br />
<br />
I need to hurry, I think. <br />
<br />
I sit down on the toilet and relax my internal muscles and in no time my stored pee starts coming out from my pussy and falling into the bowl&#39;s water making a sound not unlike my stall neighbor. <br />
<br />
I remember that when I peed in the school toilet when I was a man, I didn’t need to sit down, and while the stream of pee was coming out I used to hit the walls of the bowl, the water and even the deodorant bar that usually hangs inside the bowl. Each one produces slightly different sounds and by targeting different things the time seems to pass faster. Now my pee only comes down and it’s difficult to manipulate the stream. I move my butt a little bit to see if I can make the pee change direction, but I quickly give up; this is certainly not the time to experiment, I don’t want to make a mess the first day and be known as the girl that peed herself.<br />
<br />
Well, I may not be able to easily play with my pee, but as embarrassing as it sounds, relieving myself beside my friend in the next stall is not too bad either, I feel a strange feeling of companionship welling up inside of me. This is certainly something I couldn&#39;t experience as a man. If in the past I were to ask for a male friend to go to the bathroom with me, I would only be seen with weird eyes…That made me think… If I were to ask for a male friend to go to the bathroom together as I am right now, something more naughty would happen, not that I have male friends right now.   <br />
<br />
As I feel the last remains of my pee dribbling down between my legs, I tear a piece of toilet paper and fold it into a thick square that I proceed to use to wipe myself. Differently from boys, girls must be careful to pat themselves dry in the proper way to avoid infections; I have been very careful about this since I first obtained this body.<br />
<br />
I notice the sound from a flushed toilet coming next door so I quickly throw the tissue in the bowl and flush the toilet as well. I quickly stood up and put my clothes back how they were before.<br />
<br />
When I exit the stall, I see Hana going toward the washbasin to clean her hands and I join her in the one next to her. We resume our talk about cheerleading and decide to ask someone for more information before lunch ends.</p>
