<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Baal and Michael where about to exit the grand chamber of Archduke Belial when another portal opened up causing the crowd which had began to break apart after Michael’s and Baal’s arrival turned. The portal was a golden color which caused everyone to stand on edge meaning it was at least coming from a divine location, everyone relaxed a little as Remeila walked out. The daughter of the God and daughter-in-law of their king was one of only 4 beings who had totally access to every circle of hell and every location in heaven. The only other three was her husband, the son of lucifer Charon, Thanatos better wise known as Death and his counterpart Juventas better known as life. <br />
<br />
They four of them where outside of the courts of both heaven and hell and acted as a sort of neutral party to settle issues. Remeila being the daughter of God was of course more welcomed in Heaven then she was in Hell but it wasn’t uncommon for her or Charon to arrive in any circle in hell to take a soul which was being released to purgatory into their care. Thanatos of course dealt more with bringing souls into Hell and was likely very busy with all the additional souls that were coming in from the death of the Iron Knights, while Juventas duty was to bring the souls be them new souls from the soul trees or remade souls seeking to be reborn on earth into their new bodies moments before birth. While she hardly ever makes an appearance in Hell, she did have access.<br />
<br />
“Princess Remeila.” Greeted Belial until he saw two more angels following her. They looked very out of place, like two scholars who had wandered into a biker club. Everyone’s eyes where on them.<br />
<br />
“Archduke Belial forgive me, but I am transporting Princess Penumune Head Librarian and Master of the Holy Archives and her soon to be husband Thoth down to the 9th circle so that Thoth can meet with his mother the bride to be to Princess Astaroth and his sister, Tenebra the bride to be to Princess Miasma.” Explained Remeila giving a slight bow to the Archduke. <br />
<br />
Everyone understood then, part of the defenses around both heaven and hell was that an the four who had access to all locations couldn’t transport multiple people into Heaven or Hell. The only exception to that rule was Charon and Remeila’s daughter because both God and Lucifer loved their shared granddaughter. Whenever an Ambassador had to go to either court they had to escorted by one of the four and stop at each level (past 4th) to be checked.<br />
<br />
“I understand, Princess Remeila.” Said Archduke Belial “We will have to check them for weapons and IDs but I don’t see any on them, so it shouldn’t take long.”<br />
<br />
“Actually, my Lord that will not be needed.” Interrupted Baal as Belial looked at him confused, even Michael looked confused. “I will vouch for them; I meet them in Heaven only this day and Michael and I will escort them. I am sure Michael would want to congratulate his sister and meet his future sister-in-law in person.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Very well.” Confirmed Belial as both of them walked toward the other angels. <br />
<br />
“What is going on Baal?” whispered Michael “We are hunting the Iron Knights.”<br />
<br />
“I told you; I know they came in at least the 5th Level but now that I smell this place what I smelled came from much lower.” Stated Baal “We only came here because if we didn’t and you and I started poking around the lower levels it would look bad. Now we can skip this and go to another level once we escort them down.”<br />
<br />
“Makes sense.” Agreed Michael as the two beings shared a glare, neither liked the other but both respected the skills of the other. “Besides, Rebecca is it or whatever name she goes by now spent years living with Rev Church, she may have information to aid our search.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you for this Baal.” said Remeila “It was going to be a pain going to every level, most of all dealing with Archduke Beelzebub.”<br />
<br />
“Not a problem.” stated Baal as he opened a flaming black portal. “Shall we.”<br />
<br />
Down in lowest level of Hell Dr. Bashir was about to turn and leave after giving the invite to the four female demons when he heard the door on the other side of the chamber open. His eyes turned toward it only for him to breath a silent prayer to God for both protection and a thank him for being given such luck. It was only possible do to his divine will that he was here at this moment with this chance to end it.<br />
<br />
Walking into the chamber flanked by four guards, came what had to be the great deceiver himself. There was no debate on who it was and it was only confirmed when all the guards bowed their heads. The only one who didn’t bow their heads was the snake women who was on his arm, that had to be Lilith the Queen of the Damned. <br />
<br />
“Brother, my Queen.” Said Astaroth as she took the former human, Rev. Church wife up to him and the snake women. “Allow me to introduce Atargatis, my soon to be wife.”<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the family Atargatis if you are even half the women my sister has told me about or even a quarter of what your daughter is you will be most welcomed here.” Greeted the Devil as he took Atargatis wrist and kissed her hand. <br />
<br />
Dr. Bashir couldn’t let a chance like this get past him, it was the will of God that he was here at this moment and time. He began to move around the edge of the room while the devil began to talk to his sister, his daughter and Rev. Church’s corrupted daughter and wife. <br />
As he did he slid the dagger out from his coat sleave, the tip of the blade touching his gloved hand. He was getting closer when suddenly another black portal opened up. <br />
<br />
Walking out of the portal came another figure in black armor, his toad-like skin and cat like ears and tails clashing horribly. Behind him came to Bashir amazement an angel dressed in white robes with a black slash with lilac color eyes, halo and wings. Her skin color reminding him of some of the people he meet the time he had taken a vacation to Brazil to see the rain forest. What was an angel doing in Hell, meeting with the devil?<br />
<br />
Then three more angels came out. One had pinkish wings and looked like a strong breeze could knock her over, one had hawkish wings. The two of them looked more like scholars than threats. The last one looked like a massive threat. He was at least 10 ft tall, in golden armor with six pairs of wings coming off his back.<br />
<br />
Atargatis was just getting a huge from Lilith when a portal opened and more figures had to walk out. <br />
<br />
“Josh?” inquired Atargatis as she looked at her now angel little boy<br />
<br />
“Mom?” inquired the angel with the hawkish wings as the two of them shared an embrace while the everyone aside from Rachel stepped back as they embraced. Even the Devil stepped back bringing him closer to Dr. Bashir as he had moved around the larger group. <br />
<br />
He was within 40ft<br />
<br />
Then within 30ft<br />
<br />
Finally 20 feet.<br />
<br />
Just a little closer<br />
<br />
That is when he brushed past the small angel with pinkish wings.<br />
<br />
A strange smell entered Penumune’s nose, taking her away from watching the reunion taking place before her.<br />
<br />
Everything smelled weird to her, down here in hell but something smelled human. <br />
<br />
“You, who are you? Said Penumune as she pointed toward the demon moving toward Lucifer. That got her sister’s Remeila’s attention, as well as Michael’s. Michael as well as Penumune could see the tip of a blade in the demon’s hand.<br />
<br />
“Assassin!” yelled Remeila pointing at Dr. Bashir getting everyone’s attention including Dr. Bashir who has been focusing on Lucifer. Micheal’s hand was already going to his sword, so where other guards, some looking at Micheal at the threat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Assassin! STOP HIM!&quot; yelled Astaroth pointing at Dr. Bashir as well with one hand while reaching for her sword with the other, she had seen the glint of the dagger in his hand and most turned their focus on him and away from Micheal.<br />
<br />
His eyes widened, how could they have know, he looked like a demon, he passed the checkpoints to get into this room, how could the know?<br />
 <br />
Then he remember.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now there isn&#39;t a single being in Hell that would ever suspect you of being humans. Even General Baal&#39;s keen senses will be fooled.&quot; Came Adrammelech voice as he remembered the spell that was cast to make them smell like demons but those three behind him and the one being embraced by Atargatis were not demons…they where angels and it seams, they could smell that he wasn’t a demon.<br />
<br />
Why now?<br />
<br />
God was on his side for sure, he knew that like he knew every line in the most holy book ever written, those angels must be traitors…they had to be. He also knew he was a dead man, but he had his knife ready, and his target was only 20 feet away. <br />
<br />
He could get to him, it would be hard with so many guards coming down upon it but with God on his side it could be done. However the Deviled was armored and he had a sword as well which he was going for, so he would have to go for the head but his unarmed wife on the other side of the devil, wouldn’t be too bad of a prize either. It would take a second or two longer to get to her, but she unarmored. <br />
<br />
 Closer far closer and unarmored was the devil’s daughter Princess Maisma, but that would cause issues for Lady Cruciata and her father. That wasn’t a major concern, but it would risk the demon family turning on the other Iron knights destroying this golden chance. Beside her was the Devil’s own sister, she was armed the sword already mostly out but not armored ending her wouldn’t be too bad.<br />
<br />
The former humans that where once Rev. Church’s family was to his right with no guards around them, two of them his targets and made Lady Cruciata happy but killing them wasn’t that important compared to the Devil himself or any other pure demon. Also killing them may cause the demons to turn on the Iron Knights before they got a chance, but he was doomed any way so going after them would protect their cover.<br />
<br />
But then there where the angels behind him, they also didn’t have guards aside from the male angel but two women where between the two of them. He could kill them for betraying God. The demons wouldn&#39;t be upset if some angels die and killing traitors to God was always right.<br />
<br />
He could only pick one target.</p>
