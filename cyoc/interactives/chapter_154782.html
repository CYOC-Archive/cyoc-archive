<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You think fast and decide that telling these mermaids the truth about how you came here might prove more troublesome in the long run. Your uncle, a wizard, zapped you here for a one-month vacation after you put on a magic costume, and when the month is up, you and Alex get to go back to your old lives and your old human shapes? No, that might not go over well with the mermaids who are bound to this island and trapped for all time in their fishy forms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, uh, the year is 2019 now,&quot; you say. &quot;And it was, uh, my uncle who &#39;got&#39; us. Threw us off his boat while we were out at sea, because, uh . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex catches on right away and finishes spinning the yarn. &quot;Because John&#39;s parents are loaded, and getting us out of the way sets him up to inherit all their money someday. The backstabbing bastard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally puts her hands on her scaly hips and says, &quot;Well I can tell y&#39;all from personal experience, gettin&#39; tossed off a boat and drowned sure as shit ain&#39;t no fun. That&#39;s just awful, both of you havin&#39; to go through all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin is more fixated on the year. &quot;2019!? That means I&#39;ve been a mermaid for . . . nearly forty years!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally laughs. &quot;Startin&#39; to lose count? Don&#39;t worry, it happens to all of us eventually. Hard to keep track &#39;round here, when nothin&#39; hardly ever changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, well, at least I haven&#39;t forgotten what it was like to be human,&quot; retorts Yasmin. She gives a wistful sigh and says, &quot;Going on walks. Going out with boys. Dinner in restaurants. Dance clubs. Movies . . . oh, God, I miss movies.&quot;<br />
<br />
A thought comes to you. You ask Yasmin, &quot;You said earlier that you woke up here as a mermaid after dying in 1982?&quot; (She nods.) &quot;Damn, that sucks. You missed out on seeing &#39;Return of the Jedi&#39; by one year.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stares at you; blinks twice; it&#39;s as if a deeply buried memory is fighting its way to the surface. Then she shouts, &quot;THERE WAS A SEQUEL TO &#39;THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK&#39;!?!?&quot; (You find her posh English accent terribly cute when she yells about something so nerdy.)<br />
<br />
You nod, and she grips your hand tightly and says, &quot;Come on, you have to tell me all about it! Storytelling may not be as good as going to the cinema, but it&#39;s the best we can get around here!&quot; She takes you by the arm and pulls you away from Sally and your cousin.<br />
<br />
As you depart, Sally shouts after Yasmin, &quot;Hey, wait, what about Rule Number Three?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell him!&quot; she shouts back, dragging you away to somewhere private.<br />
<br />
* * * * * * * * *<br />
<br />
Alex is left alone with Sally, who wastes no time getting right back down to business with the island&#39;s newest mer-girl. &quot;All right,&quot; she says, &quot;Rule Number Three. This is the last one.&quot; She takes Alex by the hand and gently leads her away from the Barrier, until the border-markers are nowhere in sight. The two mermaids swim hand in hand until they come to a pretty pink patch of coral reefs, surrounded by anemones and sea-sponges and undersea blossoms. &quot;Right here is good,&quot; says Sally. &quot;Lie down on the seabed. Make yourself comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; says Alex. Your cousin, now on her second day transformed into a busty blonde supermodel from the waist up and sporting a Madison-from-&#39;Splash&#39;-colored fishtail below, allows herself to sink down and recline on the sand. Her tailfin flaps gently in the ebb of the ocean currents, stirring up little clouds of silt. She props herself up on her elbows and watches Sally intently, curious to see what the gold-tailed mermaid is going to say or do next.<br />
<br />
Sally floats down a little ways until she hovers in the water just above Alex. Then she reaches out, takes Alex&#39;s face in her hands, and kisses the other mermaid full on the lips. <br />
<br />
Alex, for her part, had already guessed that Sally was going to make a move on her. But she didn&#39;t know quite how she felt about it. As a human, Alex had always strongly identified as a girl herself, but she didn&#39;t have a strong sexual preference for girls or boys either way. &#39;Hm, guess this means that I&#39;m bi after all,&#39; she thinks to herself, because Sally&#39;s kiss definitely feels right. It&#39;s a huge turn-on for Alex, and she throws her arms around Sally and returns her kiss with fervor. Sally&#39;s first tentative lip-grazes are very quickly replaced by mutual frenching, and as they make out, the two mermaids embrace tightly, mashing their breasts together between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your taste,&quot; says Sally in breaks between kisses. &quot;So sexy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alex, her whole body flushed with arousal, writhes underneath Sally, her tail flapping wildly. &quot;I thought — you said — we couldn&#39;t do this,&quot; she gasps.<br />
<br />
Sally is kissing her way down Alex&#39;s neck now and says, &quot;Just you wait, honey. You&#39;ll see.&quot; She peppers Alex&#39;s collarbone with gentle pecks and seductive strokes of her tongue, and then moves down to Alex&#39;s 36DD-sized knockers and begins teasing her nipples with wanton abandon, a playful mix of finger-flicks, running her thumb around the nipple in soft circles, long lewd licks, and suckling. <br />
<br />
Alex throws her head back and cries out when she first feels Sally&#39;s deft tongue on her boob. Her body tenses up, she hugs Sally tightly to her torso, and her tail winds around Sally&#39;s, pinning the two mermaids together. Sally carries on, relishing every sweet kiss she can place upon the newest mermaid&#39;s gorgeous, pale breasts, and taking a small sadistic pleasure in the ease with which she is driving Alex to the limits of her tolerance. And yet she doesn&#39;t quit; she aggressively, passionately keeps on pleasuring Alex&#39;s human upper body, until, after a great many long minutes have gone by, Alex is at last reduced to hyperventilating gasps and begging Sally to stop.<br />
<br />
And so she does. Sally sits up off of Alex, demurely primping her braided hair, and asks in a disinterested tone, &quot;Well, sugar-tits, how do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex is still half out of her mind with lust and groans, &quot;I&#39;m so fucking horny! I just want to come—sooo bad!&quot; She reaches down and feels all over the scales down the front of her tail where her groin used to be, and back around to the scales on the solid lump of muscle that used to be her butt, but there is no new anatomy to find: no sex organs, no penetrable orifices, nothing. &quot;Come on,&quot; says Alex desperately, trying in futility to pry up one of the scales on the belly of her tail, just below her waist. &quot;I can feel *something* in there! It&#39;s gotta be my pussy, it just has to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What you&#39;re feelin&#39;, babe, is a little extra mucous on the inside of your egg-vent,&quot; says Sally matter-of-factly. &quot;It&#39;s what happens when mermaids get aroused. In fact, it&#39;s *all* that happens when mermaids get aroused.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex gapes at Sally. &quot;But . . . but, we were . . . and . . . and you . . . ?&quot; She balls her fists and pounds them into the sea-floor in frustration. Then Alex looks up at Sally again and asks, &quot;So why didn&#39;t I finish? Shouldn&#39;t I be laying a bunch of nasty fish-eggs right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally shrugs. &quot;Nah. A girl&#39;s egg-hole only opens up once a year, in the spring. &#39;Smatter of fact, it&#39;s the only good way to keep track of the years around here, when all the girls get all moody and squirt a bunch of eggs all over everywhere and kingdom come. You can&#39;t use the night sky, that&#39;s for damn sure; the stars above Mermaid Island are all kinds of fucked up, and never the same two nights in a row.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex, meanwhile, has at last located the tiny slit in her groin, and she touches it with the tip of her finger. It&#39;s mildly sensitive, but the feeling is more &quot;ticklish spot&quot; than &quot;erogenous zone.&quot; She decides to try and push her finger in, but she can&#39;t; either the opening is too small, or the muscles are clenched tight and won&#39;t give.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t do that,&quot; says Sally. &quot;Trust me, you&#39;ll only wind up hurtin&#39; yourself that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust you!?&quot; snaps Alex. &quot;I *did* trust you! Why the fuck did you do this to me? Kiss me, get me all worked up, and—and—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rule Number Three,&quot; says Sally. &quot;You&#39;re still human from the waist up. Still the same human you were, &#39;cept that you won&#39;t get no older. But from the waist down, you ain&#39;t got nothin&#39; that feels any good. No pussy, no clit, no butthole, no nothin&#39;. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like those poor soldiers who got hit in the spine during the Great War, or caught some shrapnel in the prick and had to have it amputated. They may still *want* it, but they just can&#39;t *feel* it down below no more, and maybe they ain&#39;t even got the parts for doin&#39; it. That&#39;s what it&#39;s like to be a mermaid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rule Number Three is makin&#39; sure you understand that. You can fool around all you like with any girls that might be willing, but most won&#39;t want to take it much further than a little kissin&#39; and pettin&#39; and maybe playin&#39; with each other&#39;s titties. You understand what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nods. She&#39;s still horny as hell, but she realizes the truth of what Sally is saying. &quot;Rule Number Three. As long as I&#39;m a mermaid, my body will crave sex just as much as it always did before. But because of my fishtail, there&#39;s no way I can come, so I shouldn&#39;t even try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally says, &quot;You&#39;ve pretty much got it. But you can forget right now about that &#39;as long as&#39; business. You&#39;re stuck here, and you&#39;re a mermaid now for keeps. You&#39;ll never change back into a real woman, and you&#39;ll never grow old and die. The only way out is to swim over that line and let yourself burn up—and you wouldn&#39;t be the first girl to finally snap and do just that—but for most of us, it ain&#39;t worth it. Better horny and alive, than dead and gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex heaved a sigh, and one big bubble of air escaped from her mouth and floated for the surface. Being a mermaid was going to prove a challenge, it seemed. She would have to find other activities to distract herself for the rest of the month. And as for these poor mermaids who had to live this way for decades and centuries, she just couldn&#39;t even process that. The mermaids had Alex&#39;s sympathy, but for her part she was very glad that she wasn&#39;t truly permanently one of them.</p>
