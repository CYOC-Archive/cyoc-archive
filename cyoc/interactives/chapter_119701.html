<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was absentmindedly playing with her tongue while staring outside the bus window. It had a strange sensation to it, which Jennifer wasn&#39;t able to place, as she hadn&#39;t felt it before. The voice of a loud girl broke her trance. &quot;Good morning Jenny!&quot; Sounded from next to her. It was Kayla. Jennifer just smiled, and put the bag, which previously sat on the still open seat next to her, onto the floor. With that, she gestured Kayla to come sit next to her. &quot;Thanks Jen! Are you ready for practice after class?&quot; Kayla said. It was very straight to the point that worried her. She hadn&#39;t been able to find her top, and she couldn&#39;t practice without.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at Kayla&#39;s bust size, and saw how it matched hers almost perfectly. &quot;Kay, you have C-cups too right?&quot; She asked her. Kayla&#39;s eyebrows went up on her forehead a bit, surprised by the question Jen just asked. Jen blushed as well, realizing how she hadn&#39;t specified why she asked it. She quickly continued. &quot;You see, I couldn&#39;t find my cheerleader top this morning, so I need to borrow someone else&#39;s, or I can&#39;t take part of the practice today.&quot; Kayla nodded her head, understanding. &quot;You&#39;re lucky I always have a spare one in my locker, unlike you.&quot; She said with a tone Jennifer didn&#39;t like. She didn&#39;t have to talk little to her did she? Nevertheless she kept her cool and acted normal. Kayla finished her sentence. &quot;You can have the spare one.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
For the rest of the trip they didn&#39;t talk to each other. Even though Kay was loud, she wasn&#39;t always too talkative. And since Jennifer wasn&#39;t in a mood to talk right now, no conversation followed. Jen had sunk back in her thoughts again. To her liking, talking felt very nice, the vibrations of her voice somehow seemed to giver her a dull pleasure when she talked. Once again, she ignored it. Besides, as both girls didn&#39;t talk on the trip, she forgot about it soon enough, only to rediscover it later.<br />
<br />
The first lesson was physics. As their teacher, mister Craven, kept murmuring about Einstein&#39;s relativity theory or something, Jen was staring in front of her. In her mouth she was twisting and turning her tongue, rubbing it to the walls in her mouth and sliding it along her teeth. It was a dull pleasure she was feeling thanks to it. She grabbed her pen and started biting on it, nothing too crazy, as teeth were still teeth. She started playing with her pen in her mouth again, trying to get rid of the strange, but unsatisfying pleasure. Just like her tongue, she rubbed the pen along the walls of her mouth, she let it slide in and out of her mouth, the part of the lips inside her mouth seemed to feel the nicest. It got a bit faster after a while, and a subconscious frown appeared on her forehead. She snapped out of her trance when she heard a moan, a second after realizing it was actually Jennifer herself.<br />
<br />
A few students next to her turned their heads to Jennifer, and mister Craven had stopped talking for a while. He luckily continued, ignoring what came from the classroom. Soon enough, the students who&#39;d turned to look at her brought their attention back to the teacher again. Jennifer had turned beet red in the process, covering her face with her slender hands, them already having dropped her pen onto the table.<br />
<br />
As Craven was done with his physics speech, he was nice enough to let Jen go to the bathroom for a bit. Arriving there, she immediately stood in front of one of the bathroom mirrors. Making sure nobody was there with her, she examined her mouth.<br />
<br />
There was not much to see to be honest. It was just a regular mouth for any human to have. It looked like it, functioned like it, but there was one thing different. It didn&#39;t feel like it. She thought back to earlier that morning, and quickly came to that one moment her vagina had just disappeared into the skin of her mouth. They must&#39;ve merged!<br />
<br />
She opened her mouth, and the first thing she touched was her tongue, which she, when thinking about it, kept under control this time. Touching it didn&#39;t feel any different, neither was it arousing when she let it out of her mouth. Her mouth, by the way, opened far wider than it used to. Was that caused by her vagina merging? She spoke, and nothing at all was wrong. It came to her observation that she more often than first would spit out some drips of her saliva. She thought about it, and for a vagina to move as fast, it would probably just squirt all juice it had in it, so this was a very mild variant.<br />
<br />
Her teeth and tongue hadn&#39;t changed in feeling, nor did Jennifer taste anything foul inside her mouth. She held a hand in front of her mouth and breathed in it, then smelled what came out. Just what she thought, the smell of her breath had, luckily, stayed the same. Next were the things that actually did feel kind of pleasurable, for example the interior of her lips. Bringing a finger along that line, all she felt was pleasure somehow, but still somewhat duller than she would feel if it were her actual pussy. The walls of her mouth, felt the same, but even duller. It wasn&#39;t too nice to make her feel amazing, but it was a great feeling nevertheless.<br />
<br />
Jennifer noticed the small round blob in the middle of her mouth, her uvula, wasn&#39;t there anymore. With that, her gag reflex would possibly be gone as well. She tried it, and put two fingers into her mouth, bringing them deeper and deeper. At some point she had passed where her uvula used to be, but somehow, mostly thanks to her mouth being able to widen more, so her whole fist fit in it, she could reach further down. In a sudden jerk -it wasn&#39;t a gag reflex-, Jennifer let in a sharp breath with the surprise sensation. She&#39;d touched the walls of her mouth behind where her uvula once sat, and out of there, a rush of pleasure erupted, immediately transferring it to her brain. <br />
<br />
Jennifer grinned slyly, as she realized what she could do with her mouth like pussy. Her boyfriend, Aaron, had something new to experience. Hell! Why not search for him today still? Jen picked up her bag from the floor and exited the bathroom, wondering what to do...</p>
