<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary groaned in ecstasy as her transformation completed.  She tried to look at herself in the mirror, but she was so tall she could only she her broad chest and large biceps in the mirror.  She laughed as she flexed and posed.  She looked down at the small doorframe. She was now taller than the door, well over seven feet. She gripped the door knob in her massive paw, and tried to open the door.  The door knob collapsed into a twisted hunk of metal under her grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid door, &quot; she grunted, as she accidentally pulled the doorknob out of the door.  She growled in frustration and anger, and hurled it across the room.  She pounded on the door, sending plaster showering down on her from the ceiling above.  The door cracked and groaned, shifting out of the door frame.  Mary grabbed the door by the exposed edges, and ripped it off its hinges.  She tossed it aside with satisfaction.<br />
<br />
She entered the living room, pounding her hand into her fist.  She felt good, full of energy and power.  And she wanted to test out her strength again.  That lousy mutt that had threatened her seemed like  a good place to start.  <br />
<br />
<br />
As she entered the living room, she was shocked by the sight before her.  John was there.  Apparently he got her message.  She was glad to see him, and her tail wagged a bit.  But right beside him was her doppelganger - a young girl that looked exactly like her!  What was going on?<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is that?&quot; said John, staring at Mary in shock. <br />
<br />
Mary tried to explain, but it was difficult to find the right words to use.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you .... that&#39;s Max!  He turned into a monster and attacked me!&quot; said the young girl.<br />
<br />
Mary looked at the girl in shock.  What was she talking about?  She wasn&#39;t Max. Where was that stupid dog?  And who was this person? She was obviously a liar.  A bad person.  She growled angrily at the young girl.<br />
<br />
John assumed a defensive position, and shielded the young girl.  He held up a stick in one hand and some kind of electrical device in the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad Max!  Bad boy!&quot; said John angrily.<br />
<br />
Mary was hurt.  How could he call her that?  She whimpered a little, and lowered her ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;No ... Max ....&quot; she struggled to say, in a deep gravely voice.<br />
<br />
John dropped his hands in shock, almost discharging the taser on his leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can talk, &quot; said John softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t listen to it.  It&#39;s evil, &quot; said the young girl.<br />
<br />
Mary glared at the girl and snarled.  She looked exactly like her.  Who was she?  She was even wearing Mary&#39;s clothes!  But the dress fit her terribly, and it looked like it was inside out.  It was like the girl had never worn clothes before.  Mary looked into her room, violated by the stranger.  She looked through the open door, and saw the box of vials sitting on her bed.  She looked at the ground near the coffee table, and saw that the puddle of the &quot;Human&quot; solution was gone.  Then she finally understood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Max.....&quot; she grunted angrily, and lunged towards the identity thief.<br />
<br />
She felt a shock on her arm, and looked down to see John trying to electrocute her with his taser.  It hurt, but her body was more than capable of withstanding a small charge meant for the body of smaller dog.  She howled in pain, and turned to growl at John.<br />
<br />
She could see the fear on his face, as he pulled Max protectively behind him again.  He bravely waved the stick at her, but she could smell the pheromones of his fear. She whimpered, ashamed at how she had scared him.  She was not a monster. She was not the bad one. It was Max who was bad.  Mary lunged towards her bedroom, intending to get the box of vials.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; shouted Max, as he slammed the door in front of her.  John quickly joined Max, shielding what he thought was Mary from the beast again, and blocking the door.  Mary howled in frustration.  She needed the vials, but she did not want to hurt John.  She didn&#39;t know what to do. She heard sirens, and looked out the large living room window to see several police cars pulling up into the parking lot.  She didn&#39;t have time to flight.  She had to flee.<br />
<br />
Mary ran to the living room, and jumped through the large glass window.  She sent shards of glass flying everywhere, but she landed safely and without harm.  She heard the gasps of onlookers as they saw the strange monster that had escaped from Mary&#39;s apartment. She cast one sad glance back up to the living room window - looking at John and Max as they gazed down at her from above -  before running off into the nearby woods.</p>
