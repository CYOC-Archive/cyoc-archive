<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In contrast to his brother, Eric&#39;s Tuesday was great. The best thing was getting really good marks on the previous day&#39;s test, but a close second was having Ms Peres pull him aside after class and tell him it was okay that he was proud of his body, but that it wasn&#39;t clever or funny to stuff anything into his underwear. To that Eric had smiled politely and told her that he hadn&#39;t stuffed anything anywhere and it was simply &#39;all mine&#39;, even adding -- quite seriously -- that if it helped he was willing to get a doctor&#39;s letter to prove it. Then, like the innocent well-mannered young man that he was, Eric wished her a good afternoon and took his leave from the stunned teacher, heading to the next bloc while he tried not to laugh.<br />
<br />
On the way home, the brothers shared their adventures, and in the spirit of their continuing closeness, they told each other everything. Ethan wasn&#39;t too worried anymore about Eric learning about sex when he was 11, because their 17 year old cock had already taught him a lot -- and because Eric wasn&#39;t stupid. Sometimes he could be a little naive because he was younger, but usually, he was sharp. Still, Ethan noticed that his little brother had a boyish freshness in his attitude whenever they mentioned anything sexual, and when he heard about Ethan&#39;s incident with Haylee, his eyes were like saucers. He loved every second of the tale, and hung on the words.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were, um ... inside her ... when I swapped us?&quot; Eric was bright red, but clearly enthralled by his older brother&#39;s sexual escapade, and he giggled nervously. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I have the worst timing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; Ethan swallowed, anxious himself at admitting the enjoyment of his little dick to Eric. He gripped the steering wheel hard as he turned into the street neighbouring their home. &quot;It was, uh- ... exciting. I liked it. A lot!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, if you want I can give you my cock for longer.&quot; Eric&#39;s offer was serious. &quot;If anything feels unfair, I want to know. I don&#39;t wanna be a hog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said it was your choice, and it is.&quot; Ethan reaffirmed, as they cruised the final stretch home, not wanting to pressure Eric in either direction. &quot;If I&#39;m going to be small all day, then that&#39;s how it is.&quot; He slapped the wheel dramatically. &quot;You should have fun with it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really glad you said that because I have an idea for tomorrow,&quot; Eric smiled broadly, &quot;and I&#39;m gonna have to be big to enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Wednesday for Eric was a friendly school competition between the junior soccer grades. Though he was still small compared to his classmates, he was a quick runner and his recent penis-related change in reputation had even boosted his standing in the eyes of his team mates. Sports participation had suddenly become interesting for Eric, though for reasons his peers wouldn&#39;t yet understand.<br />
<br />
The soccer competition started midday and ran until the end of the school day. With seven-a-side instead of eleven, smaller fields, and shorter games, the pace was quicker and energetic. Eric loved it, but he was also loving something else about the situation.<br />
<br />
His soccer uniform -- both shirt and shorts -- were soft nearly-satin material, and normally were loose enough on boys his age, but now, for Eric? The fabric seemed to pool and flow around his bulge like water and the feel of it on the closer-fitting underwear beneath was magical. He&#39;d worn something a little tighter to keep everything in place, and the constant rubbing of the material layers was amazing, the pleasant friction causing his junk to plump, lightly swelling with blood and excitement. Contained that way, when running, jogging, or even sometimes just walking up and down the sidelines, Eric&#39;s groin would gently bounce and bob with the movement.<br />
<br />
Naturally, he spent as much time moving around as he could.<br />
<br />
The glances he got were the icing on the cake, and Eric was beginning to understand the power of his endowed status. He knew he was a cute slender boy, but seeing other people be charmed and intimidated -- but most of all confused -- by the apparently completely-natural-looking-but-impossibly-teenage sexual magnetism jiggling at his crotch? It made him confident and energised and very happy!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it also began to make him horny.<br />
<br />
It was near the end of the competition when he started to get worked up. One of the shorts seams kept dragging on him in the exact wrong way, and Eric could feel the stimulation move into the beginnings of an erection. Thinking quickly, he made up an excuse to use the bathroom, accepting the coach&#39;s warning that it had to be hasty because Eric might be needed to sub on. Clad in just his uniform and socks, Eric was navigating past the bleachers to inside, when he had a brainwave.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t really WANT to go to the bathroom to calm his intruding teenage hormones, so what if he didn&#39;t HAVE to?<br />
<br />
Slipping through a gap around the edge of the seating to climb under the bleachers, Eric eyed the deserted underside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody ever looks here,&quot; he thought, surprised that he was even considering it, &quot;and the risk could be fun. Really REALLY fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
What if he just ... took care of it right there?<br />
<br />
Choosing a spot where he could directly see anyone approaching, team mates or otherwise -- both through the slats above on the seating and below where he was -- Eric sat down and lowered his shorts, letting the monster unfurl. Half hard, his dick swelled and lengthened into a regular big-boy hardon before he tenderly kissed the head. He was still very limber and ready from his soccer warmup, so this was going to be easy! <br />
<br />
&quot;All mine!&quot; Eric thought gleefully, as he bent and placed a series of licks along the shaft before he simply swallowed as much of it as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmgnnfhh!&quot; It felt so good, he let out a muffled moan as his hot wet lips slid down the girth. Eyes flicking to the sounds and motions of someone walking by, he began to slowly raise and lower his head, all the while still watching for anyone going past above. They continued on, no danger, and then there was another person, and a third, and Eric realised that not only could the pedestrians not see him directly, but almost certainly couldn&#39;t hear him either. Soon he was slurping unashamedly, the wet smacking sounds of his open dicksucking just making him stiffen even more.<br />
<br />
The risk and thrill was intense, and Eric was committed fully to the newest iteration of his hobby-addiction.<br />
<br />
&quot;My cock is the best,&quot; Eric mumbled to himself, staring at each set of shoes as they went by, filled with horny pride at what he could do with it. He played with his balls, rolling and lightly squeezing them in admiration at how fat and smooth they were, as he continued to watch, and eagerly suck. Eric&#39;s attention was split between his favourite toy -- how thoroughly it filled his mouth, and how it was so thick his hungrily guzzling throat felt like a glove squeezing it -- and those walking obliviously by. They were so close but so clueless! Thankfully it was mostly students, faculty members, or family heading into the adjoining school block, until he glimpsed a team mate walking by.<br />
<br />
It was Josh Henderson, his friend. The one who he was probably going to sub for!<br />
<br />
One who definitely knew of his current location as a hidey hole.<br />
<br />
His nerves spiking, Eric began to suck quicker, his head bobbing as fast as his gag reflex would allow, his eyes following Josh&#39;s ankles as they rounded the bleacher end and began walking through to the gap between the seating and the wall.<br />
<br />
Stuffing his face even more with his dick, he was putting his full skill to work at high speed, and as Josh reached halfway, Eric&#39;s enormous penis spasmed and began to rapidly blast. His toes clenched, his butt tightened, and an ecstatic warmth flooded him as thick fluid rushed down into his gullet. Hastily, frantically, Eric was swallowing it, his throat working overtime to handle it all, and fearfully following Josh&#39;s impending arrival. There was SO much to take -- more than ANY previous time, it seemed! -- and Eric was shocked at how the volume just kept going, his sizable nuts more full than he knew.<br />
<br />
At the last moment, Eric sat up. His cock jerked out of his mouth with a soft wet slurping &#39;pop&#39; of releasing pressure, and he wiped his flushed face with an arm, yanking his soccer shorts back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Eric!&quot; Josh spotted him the moment after rounding the corner. &quot;Coach is saying you&#39;re about to be up to play mid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he muttered, trying to talk, but it came out thickly. Remembering that the inside of his mouth and throat were still liberally coated in the contents of his own balls, Eric swallowed heavily. He felt the remaining sperm, a viscous mouthful, slide down his throat and into his stomach, and with a twinge of satisfaction, innocently licked his lips, like nothing had happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; He tried again, his voice now normal and unobstructed. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they climbed out from under, Josh shot him a question, too tired himself and not aware enough to notice Eric&#39;s appearance and quickened breathing, and also not paying much attention anyhow.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you doing down there anyways?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing really.&quot; Eric caught a glimpse of himself in a window reflection as they emerged back onto the bleachers. With a dextrous tongue-swipe, he scooped up the rogue glob of cum at the corner of his mouth, and drew it quickly in before Josh could notice the selfsucking evidence. Then a final covert swallow, and it slipped down to join the rest.<br />
<br />
Exactly where it belonged, if he thought about it.<br />
<br />
After all, who knew his cock better than him?<br />
<br />
Eric grinned, and shrugged casually to his friend. &quot;Just ... having fun.&quot;</p>
