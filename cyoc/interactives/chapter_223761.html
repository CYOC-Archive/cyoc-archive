<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claire could feel the change hit her legs immediately. It felt like a cool wintergreen breeze flowing all the way down to her toes.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t believe it. In an instant, her legs were completely smooth and silky. It actually worked! There was no unsightly stubble; no dark, pinhead specks; no imperfections at all. She began rubbing her legs together indulgently, moaning softly. Every inch felt like buttered baby skin. She jumped and danced around in unrestrained celebration. It was a small change, but the relief she felt at never having to deal with shaving again was phenomenal!<br />
<br />
Claire could hardly wait to see how the world had changed for the better. She felt like doing cartwheels on her way down the stairs.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when she saw Brian, her twelve-year-old brother, sitting on the couch in nothing but his boxers. He was mindlessly watching one of those stupid kid&#39;s cartoons with his bare feet up on the armrest. She wondered if Brian was old enough yet to start getting leg hairs and quietly snuck up behind him to see for herself.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the boy&#39;s ankles were coated in little wiry hairs just as she had intended. She only hoped to be around to see them get him into trouble one day, and as chance would have it, she didn&#39;t have to wait long.<br />
<br />
Just then a pair of anthropomorphic cat women with ridiculous proportions and giant boobs came onto the screen. They were boasting about being powerful warrior princesses of a noble clowder while they sharpened their weapons by the fire. When the busty she-cat with the battle axe finished her task, she licked the giant blade seductively. <br />
<br />
*chi-* *chirp*<br />
<br />
Brian&#39;s ankles were crossed and gently rubbing across one another. The sound was quick and soft, but unmistakable. He had just chirped like a cricket! Claire had to hold back from laughing, the momentary sound was so adorable. Her little brother really was just a little horn dog!<br />
<br />
Just then, a door swung open upstairs. &quot;BRIAN! Was that you? Was that a chirp!?&quot; Their Mom yelled with frantic concern.<br />
<br />
Brian bolted up from his reclined position and a jolt of fear flashed across his face. &quot;No, Mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire couldn’t believe her mom could hear such a quiet sound from all the way upstairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you watching?!&quot; She demanded on her way down the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just cartoons, Mom.&quot; He said, fumbling to grab the remote so he could change the show to anything else.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, his mom was too fast.<br />
<br />
“Cats, Brian? You’re chirping over cats?”<br />
<br />
“No, Mom. Seriously, I just… farted, ok?”<br />
<br />
“I know a chirp when I hear one.” She said, turning around to inspect Brian’s legs. “Look at that.” she said, pointing to his ankles accusatively. “How long has all that been there?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. I never noticed that before!”<br />
<br />
“Sit down.” She said forcefully. “I need to get a better look at that. I think you might -. Well, let’s just see.”<br />
<br />
Brian sat back down on the sofa and slumped his shoulders sheepishly while his mom grabbed his bare feet from the bottoms and lifted his legs up to get a better view.<br />
<br />
“Mom!” Brian grumbled, trying to pull his legs out of her grasp.<br />
<br />
“Sit still, Brian, this is serious.” She commanded and waited for him to stop struggling while she maintained a deathgrip on his bare feet. Once he finally gave up on struggling, she forced his thin legs to come together at the ankles and gently pulled his feet in opposite directions to force them to rub against one another.<br />
<br />
*Chi-* *ch-* *chirp*<br />
<br />
Brian started squirming again as the friction between his legs sent shivers across his entire body. He couldn’t stand the embarrassment of having his mom force his legs to chirp. It was terrible. It was mortifying. And even worse, it was starting to give him a freaking boner!<br />
<br />
“Stop it, Mom!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, god… It’s Just as I thought.” She said with defeat. “You were chirping over those cat women, weren’t you. You were actually chirping over cats! Is that what you’re into, Brian? Is that what you like? Is it some kind of fetish for you?”<br />
<br />
Brian&#39;s face was starting to turn almost crimson red. “No, Mom. I like girls… Normal human girls… I - I wasn’t even watching Thunderfelines, I was playing on my phone, and-”<br />
<br />
“-Then let me look at your phone.” She demanded.<br />
<br />
“What? No. No way!”<br />
<br />
“I need to know what we’re dealing with here, Brian. This is serious. You’re chirping... My little, boy - my baby - chirping!...” tears started to well up in her eyes as her emotions slowly started to break down.<br />
<br />
“Mom, it’s not a big deal, ok?”<br />
<br />
“You don’t think getting a girl pregnant is a big deal?! Brian, don’t you understand, you’re going to need to be responsible for this; you’re too young to handle that…”<br />
<br />
“I can handle it, Mom. I’ll never chirp again. I promise!” The look of desperation and pleading in his eyes seemed unusual to Claire. What made this such a big deal?<br />
<br />
After a long silence their mom finally gave a long, exhausted sigh. “- I think it’s time we put you in t-pants.” She said with resignation.<br />
<br />
“No… Mom, seriously, NO! I’m too young for that. Nobody in my class wears those. I’ll look like a freaking loser!”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know what other option we have, Brian. You can’t go to school in shorts anymore.”<br />
<br />
“But Nate’s parents let him wear Jeans!” Brian pleaded pathetically.<br />
<br />
Their mom grabbed his feet again and rubbed his legs together a few more times, causing a soft chirping to fill the room and Brian’s boner to grow even more in his underwear.<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid jeans are no good for you, Brian, you&#39;d chirp right through those even if you had your socks rolled up… Nate’s legs couldn’t possibly be as far along sweetie. I’m sorry, we should have had you in t-pants weeks ago. If you went to school tomorrow without them you’d be chirping at the first pretty girl you saw.”<br />
<br />
“God, Mom. I won’t though, ok?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, you will, honey. I’m afraid you can’t help it… And I’m afraid it isn’t your choice about the t-pants either. We’re putting you in a pair right away; end of discussion… I’m sure nobody will even notice you wearing them; your shirt will cover up the straps… I’ll ask your sister to - Oh, Claire, I didn’t notice you were here… I guess you know what’s going on… would you mind taking Brian to the mall for a pair of t-pants? I have to leave for work, I’m already going to be late, but Brian really needs to be put in a pair right away.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, sure.” Clare said, dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
“Oh, thank you.” She said with relief. “I really appreciate you helping out with this, Claire. I can’t believe he’s matured so fast. It was only just yesterday when-” Tears started to well up in her eyes again… “- well, i’ll see you both after work.” She quickly got a few things together and made her way out the door while Brian slumped miserably with his head in his hands, but before she went out the door, she quietly turned to Claire and said, “Try to pick him out something nice, he likes to look cool, you know, I’m sure you can find a good pair at that skater boy shop he likes, Zoomies, just use my credit card and give your dad the key when he gets home...”<br />
<br />
“I love you both! Try to have a good day, Brian. Don’t feel bad… I’m sorry about this, but I promise you’ll be just fine. The other boys won’t even notice. Goodbye, kids.”<br />
<br />
With that, their mom left them to their own company. They stayed in silence for a while, neither wanting to talk to the other. Claire was stunned and confused by what she had just seen. She knew her mom was a little crazy about sexual purity and virtue, but you’d think a boy should be able to chirp a bit every once in a while without starting a giant incident…<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Thunderfelines continued to play in the background - “Meow - I can smell them…” one of the she-cats said, her whiskers twitching in an alluring way, “their scent is potent, even from this distance... Lizards, and there are many!”<br />
<br />
*Chirp* *Chirp*<br />
<br />
“BRIAN!”</p>
