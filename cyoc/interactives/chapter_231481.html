<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris tapped his fingers nervously as the taxi turned the corner leading into the cul-de-sac he lived. That weird, achy feeling had passed, which must have meant he&#39;d stopped growing for the time being. But who knew if or when it would start up again. The sooner he reached that clock and fixed this mess, the better.<br />
<br />
He shifted about uncomfortably in his seat. There was a persistent itch underneath the tattered remains of his clothes. Based on the extensive treasure trail that was visible circling his belly button and spreading out to areas unseen, he suspected the cause but wasn&#39;t exactly prepared to find out. It was lucky he still had something covering his body. He&#39;d already shredded the majority of the seams of his shirt and pants, and the stray bonds keeping them together left him feeling tight and restrictive. He wished he could rip them off altogether, but he didn&#39;t want to give the driver any more reason to find him suspicious. Although the guy didn&#39;t seem to be paying any attention to him. Or was intentionally ignoring him. It was hard to tell... But he couldn&#39;t dwell on that. All he could do was wait to pull up to the curb.<br />
<br />
Finally, Chris jumped out of the taxi with a hoarse thank you, stretched out his overgrown body, and sprinted up towards his house. He breathed a sigh of relief as he noticed no parked car. His dad was obviously at work, his mom was likely socialising at the club. This meant he had the house to himself for the time being. For how long, he didn&#39;t know. Hopefully long enough to find the clock, and turn himself back to normal.<br />
<br />
He bolted up to the door, rummaging through the small backpack that could once fit so comfortably across his shoulders in order to find his house keys, before stumbling into the house. He slammed the door behind him, and waited. There was no errant voice expressing surprise that someone was home. No creaks or footsteps of someone checking who had entered. He truly was alone. He fell back into the front door, expressing another relieved sigh. Things were going well for him, despite evidence to the contrary. All he had to do now was grab the clock, and fix the thing.<br />
<br />
As Chris bounded towards the staircase, some brief movement to his side caught his attention. He jumped back in reflex, anxious over who could be with him. But his eyes only fell on a decorative mirror, and on his reflection. Any urgency to reach the clock faded away as he stood transfixed by the mirage. The image of a man who looked by all accounts to be in his mid twenties, a vision of himself at least ten years in the future.<br />
<br />
The first thing that caught Chris&#39; eye was the dark shadow covering the lower half of his face. He reached up and gingerly felt the dense stubble on his cheeks, looking to be at least a week&#39;s worth of growth. He&#39;d felt the coarse scruff by accident whilst in the taxi and proceeded to avoid touching his face again, no matter how itchy it felt. But seeing it up close, just how high up on his cheeks it grew, how far down his neck it stretched, was an entirely different experience. It was rough to the touch, and highlighted just how strong and angular his jawline had become. Wide beneath the ears and jutting forward to a point in an almost triangular fashion. Far different from his originally round, cherub-like features.<br />
<br />
Chris stepped back so he could get a better look at himself, ducking slightly as his head popped out of frame. A brief, giddy laugh escaped his lips at the thought of having to even duck to see himself properly. Even after his astounding four-inch growth spurt the other day, he&#39;d managed to get even taller. He was probably the tallest kid in his class now! Which wasn&#39;t as impressive as it sounded, considering he was now old enough to have graduated college. But after being such a short-stack all his life, he was going to take the victories when he could!<br />
<br />
He also couldn&#39;t help but notice just how broad he had got. His T-shirt, now more of a crop top, was hanging on for dear life. And while it was one of his favourites, he didn&#39;t waste time grabbing hold of the front and, after clenching his eyes shut, ripping it straight off his torso. &quot;That felt good,&quot; he cheerfully grumbled as he took in several deep breaths without the restrictions. He slowly opened his eyes, locked onto his bare chest, and gasped aloud. He had pecs! Actual, properly round and grabbable pecs! Not to mention the plentiful amount of chest hair that blanketed them in a sea of brown that rolled up towards his shoulder-blades and connected with the treasure trail across his tight waist. He immediately launched both of his hands up to the furry globes and gave them a good jiggle, his face twisting into a goofy smile. Chris had tried working out to get some muscle before, to no avail. So to see his adult self was brawny as fuck with a pelt of fur to match made him feel oh so good. Maybe this broken clock wasn&#39;t such a problem after all...<br />
<br />
After being left barefoot at the school, his feet now so large he&#39;d likely put hobbits to shame, all Chris had left to do was get rid of his pants. They&#39;d already shredded straight past his calves, and he&#39;d busted the buttons down his crotch. Even so, they were surprisingly easy to slide off, yanking them down around his ankles and stepping out. But what he hadn&#39;t banked on was losing his boxers at the same time. He stood back up and cringed as he caught sight of the python he&#39;d released, partially hidden in a sea of thick pubes. <br />
<br />
As he stared at the reflection of his fully naked, broad, hairy, adult body, he felt a familiar stirring in the loins. He&#39;d awoken the snake, his dick throbbing as it slowly but surely hardened up. Chris gulped as it kept growing thicker and longer, until he had an erect nine-incher just waiting to be played with. He reached down and placed a hand underneath, his gut turning at just how large it was, and wrapped his palm around the base. So long, he&#39;d need two fists to hold it. So girthy, his fingers didn&#39;t even meet. A flood of endorphins enveloped his brain as he began to slowly tug his fist up and down the length of his cock. With his free hand, he ran his fingers across his toned stomach, brushing through the hairs that graciously coated him. He dragged his hand upwards, lightly tugging on the dense cluster of hairs in the center of his chest, before drifting his needy paw to his left pec and giving his nipple a squeeze. He moaned as an electric shock twitched through his body. His eyes drifted up to the mirror, gazing at the hirsute man masturbating to his own buffed up body. A body far more masculine and adult than he should have. And it was all thanks to that clock.<br />
<br />
His eyes widened as that single clear thought rang through his mind. &quot;Snap out of it!&quot; Chris cried as he slapped a hand across his face. He rubbed his jaw, wincing at the tingling pain and the rough sandpapery feel of his unshaven skin. There wasn&#39;t time for this!. He may be a glorious hunk, but he was on a mission. He could get a better feel of himself after he&#39;d retrieved the clock!<br />
<br />
So Chris dragged himself away from the mirror and bounded up the stairs. His erect cock bounced up and down with every step, sometimes whacking into his thigh as if annoyed of being disrupted and begging for attention. But he managed to keep a clear mind long enough to reach his bedroom, briefly pausing to look at the door frame where his mom had measured his height over the years, each labelled with a date. He brushed his fingers over the most recent notch in the wall from a few days ago, which had a significantly large gap reminiscent of a growth spurt. But of course, he knew the truth. And now he was even taller than that notch, which hovered just below shoulder height. He had to have been a foot taller, at least, he thought with a wistful smile. He had always hoped he was a late bloomer, and now he was a six foot something hunk with a carpet of body hair and muscles for days. He briefly considered abandoning his search for the clock. Why bother going back to that mediocre hell when he was practically supermodel quality now. But then he thought about his friends and family, how he couldn&#39;t just abandon them. He dwelled on how the clock had worked by itself, and how he could potentially get older again. So he reluctantly pushed on.<br />
<br />
After a pause to consider how small his bedroom was, and how he towered over everything in a way he couldn&#39;t even have dreamed on, Chris fell to his knees and crawled towards the bed. It was more difficult to get underneath now that he was a much bigger man. It wasn&#39;t made any easier by his throbbing cock rubbing against the carpet as he stretched underneath, sending shivers up his spine and started to leak pre-cum. But he had to persevere. After a few initial sweeps of the arm only fished up the clock&#39;s instructional booklet, he finally ducked his head underneath to confirm his suspicion; the clock was gone!<br />
<br />
He rolled away and laid on the floor, staring up at the ceiling. Even now, he was reminded of just how much bigger he was. There was barely any room for him to lay flat. He stayed silent for a few minutes, thinking. He&#39;d left the clock under his bed, covered by an old shirt. The rest of his room was tidy, with no nooks or crannies for it to be hidden or misplaced. Why would anyone enter his room and take the clock? He expressively had a &#39;no trespassing&#39; sign on the door! That meant nobody was allowed in. The trust in his parents had lessened. But there was no use moping. The clock had stopped for now, but who knew if or when it would change him again. He had to find it before then, and he had an idea where to look next - his parents&#39; bedroom. If not to find the clock, at the very least he could get some clothes, he thought to himself as a stray breeze made him shiver. He may be a whole lot hairier, but it wasn&#39;t enough to keep him warm. He raised his head a little to look down at his body, but his large pecs with that hairy coating blocked his view of the rest of his body. He leant on his elbows to see his cock still erect, still throbbing with pent-up arousal. He hoped it would have gotten bored of waiting and died down, yet it was still as needy as ever. Maybe it wouldn&#39;t hurt to give himself the release he so desperately needed...</p>
