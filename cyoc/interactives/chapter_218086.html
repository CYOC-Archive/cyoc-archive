<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff cried into the thick penis gag as the burglar went into the next room to investigate the chronovac. Jeff&#39;s girly white boy ass felt hot from the harsh spanking he&#39;d received. He couldn&#39;t even lower his legs or close his knees together. He felt so small and exposed. Why had he turned himself into his little brother?<br />
<br />
He heard typing and clicking from the other room. Was the burglar turning him back into his normal body before stealing the computer? That was the deal, right? It sure was taking the man a while.<br />
<br />
Jeff tugged on the restraints some more. No matter what he tried, he was just stuck. He desperately hoped the burglar would hurry up and come fuck him... No wait! Where had that thought come from!? He hoped the burglar would come release him. Yeah. That&#39;s what he&#39;d meant.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt himself growing restless. The restraints held him so good and tight. It felt amazing to be tied up like this. No! It felt awful! He shook his head, trying to clear it of these strange desires. His body trembled with lust though. He needed someone to touch him. Punish him. No. That was wrong! He thrashed in guilt and shame at the thoughts, clenching his eyes. He couldn&#39;t look at himself. He felt so embarrassed at his own nudity.<br />
<br />
Then he felt the restraints beginning to tug harder. He opened his eyes in surprise. Had the burglar finished. Had he quietly returned and begun pulling the chains?<br />
<br />
No, Jeff slowly began to realize. The chains weren&#39;t getting shorter. His limbs were! He cried out in panic into his gag as he gradually began to regress even more. Becoming smaller and smaller. One year. Then another. Then another... His girly butt lifted higher into the air as his little hairless legs became too small for his butt to reach the mattress. The penis gag began to feel bigger and thicker.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, his shortening little arms pulled tighter on the chains at the corner of the bed. If this continues, he&#39;d be ripped in two! Then, &quot;slip&quot; His now tiny hands slid out of the leather straps around his wrists. He struggled some more and fell out of the leg straps that were practically dangling him upside-down.<br />
<br />
He was free! But only because he&#39;d shrunk so much more than that little body he&#39;d already had. He stumbled out of the bed, staggering at how far away the floor had been. He felt so awkward and incredibly delegate. Like a stiff breeze would carry him away. He unbuckled the gag with difficulty and gaped wide to pull it out. Almost feeling reluctant to not have something to suck on.<br />
<br />
He felt so incredibly shy. He really really wanted to cover himself with his hands, but his hands refused to hide his nudity. Like there was a magnetic repulsion preventing him from covering up. And yet it turned him on so much that his face was flush with desire and his little breaths were short and quick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than I could have hoped.&quot; The burglar stood in the doorway watching Jeff. He was huge from Jeff&#39;s perspective now. A giant! Shameful tears welled up in Jeff&#39;s eyes as he felt himself automatically begin to pose for the man. As if trying to turn him on. Asking to be molested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make me big again!&quot; Jeff cried in a childishly light voice. The burglar reached down and scooped him up into his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awe, don&#39;t worry. I made sure you never get bigger than this. Your new age is locked in place. This is how you&#39;ll look from now on. You&#39;ll have to streach just to open doors. You&#39;ll need help getting a glass from the cupboard. You&#39;ll need a pillow under your butt when sitting at the dinner table...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears of humiliation welled up in Jeff&#39;s eyes, but the burglar was far from done teasing him about his new life.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you&#39;ve probably noticed, I&#39;ve made you incredibly shy, but unable to cover yourself. In fact, you compulsively need to show your body off. And humiliation turned you on. Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ll never get used to the feeling.&quot; The burglar reached down between Jeff&#39;s thighs and ran a finger up between his cheeks, fingering Jeff&#39;s entrances. Jeff gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes. This thing will always be nice a tight, but flexible enough for anyone to enjoy. You no longer need food. All you need is cum. And cum from big black cocks is what your body craves the most. No one will find that strange but you. They&#39;ll just think you&#39;re a shameful slut. No one will remember you ever being bigger than this. It&#39;ll just be expected that you&#39;re a natural cum receptical.&quot; Jeff gasped as the finger entered him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You give off a constant aura of lust now. Any man you&#39;re around will be filled with a desire to punish and use you in all kinds of sedistic ways. And women will feel that you deserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff clung to his tormenter, both loving and hating the feeling of being fingered like this. Then the finger was removed and Jeff almost cried out for him not to stop. But then he felt the burglar&#39;s thick, warm cock head pressing up against his entrance. And Jeff lowered himself onto it on his own. Like a hand pulled automatically away from a hot stove, Jeff couldn&#39;t help but fuck himself into the man&#39;s cock. It hurt so good! He gasped with confused tears on his cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; the big black man said. &quot;Even now, your aura makes me incapable of feeling any guilt at all about doing this to you. It just feels right. Even your own family will not be able to resist using you. It won&#39;t even occur to them that it&#39;s wrong. But they&#39;ll still call you a slut and know you should be ashamed of yourself.&quot; <br />
<br />
The burglar held Jeff around the waste and began plowing away. Jeff&#39;s teeth rattled from the impacts. His belly extended with every thrust. For ten minutes the burglar fucked him like a jackhammer.<br />
<br />
Jeff cried out as cum filled his insides like a balloon. And a warm glow of satisfaction radiated though all the pain and humiliation. Deep down, he knew he had served his purpose. Being a cum dump was what he was made for.<br />
<br />
The cock pulked out, and Jeff&#39;s little entrances quickly regained it&#39;s virgin tightness, holding in the cum he&#39;d been gifted. His head swam with bliss even though he himself hadn&#39;t cum. Then he snapped back to himself. Anger and resentment washed over him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t do this to me! You can&#39;t leave me like this!&quot; The burglar just smiled wickedly, then gripped Jeff around the throat and squeezed. Jeff tried to gasp for breath, but he just hung there being strangled. He kicked into the air, and clawed with tiny fingers at the mighty grip. The burglar watched in amusement. Even now, Jeff&#39;s aura of lust and punishment made him not feel any mercy or guilt for doing this. In fact, it felt like a moral obligation to punish the boy. He could see how hard the treatment made Jeff. The poor boy was totally getting off on this. His hips were thrusting into open air. His little dicklet stiff and eager.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s struggles weakended, and his limbs went limp as he lost consciousness. The burglar carried the unconscious boy back to his room and lay him down on his bed.<br />
<br />
The room too had changed to fit Jeff&#39;s transformation. No longer the room of an 18 year old. Even the clothes in the wardrobe were all slutty clothes and costumes made for his small size. He&#39;d never grow out of them. That was for sure.<br />
<br />
The bruises on Jeff&#39;s neck were beginning to fade already. And the redness from the spanking earlier was vanishing too. Jeff&#39;s body would make use of the cum he received, and use it to rapidly heal himself after punishment. Even as he watched, Jeff&#39;s cum bloated belly shrank back to normal as the cum was absorbed.<br />
<br />
This healing would allow the next man to administer fresh punishment soon after without worrying about breaking Jeff. He&#39;s always be ready for more abuse. And he&#39;d love every second of it, despite it all.<br />
<br />
With that, the burglar packed up the computer with the chronicac, and left.</p>
