<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;If what you say is true, Madame, I think that I&#39;d be okay with being a four-year-old, but only while I&#39;m in school.&quot;  &quot;Very well, Damon, you&#39;ve made your choice!  You get to be four just like all the other boys and girls while at school.  And, might I add, just as smart as well.&quot;  The crowd roared with laughter at the thought of a thirty-year-old returning to Pre-K, but Monica wasn&#39;t laughing with them.  She grew furious and stormed up on stage.  &quot;Are you stupid Damon?&quot;, asked Monica.  &quot;You&#39;ve just doomed yourself to be a small child for seven hours a day and five days a week!  What about your job?&quot;  &quot;Monica dear, being in Pre-K is his job!&quot;, replied Madame Illusia.  &quot;But, you&#39;ve come up on my stage and ruined my show.  And you call Damon stupid?  The only one stupid, Monica, is you!  I think you could use a little bit of an education yourself.  However, I don&#39;t think Pre-K is a good fit for you.&quot;  Madame Illusia then swished her hand toward Monica causing Monica to be unable to speak or move.  &quot;Monica, stupid boys and girls get special classes and I think you could use an extra special class, indeed.&quot;, Madame said.  The crowd gasped.  Madame Illusia again swished her hand toward Monica.  At first, Monica didn&#39;t feel anything but her inability to move, but then she felt her panties thickening under her pants as the material rubbing against her crotch begin to feel less silky and more like paper like the top sheet you find in a disposable diaper.  Her expensive high heels lost their height and shape turning from black to gray as they turned into generic walking shoes with velcro straps.  Her expensive leather pants lost its black color and turned into blue jean shorts that had snaps in the crotch, extra room in the seat to accommodate a very thirsty diaper and an elastic waist in the the back so that the shorts can fit over said diaper.  Her blouse morphed into a simple pink T-shirt as her gold necklace turned to green cloth and expanded around her neck and down her chest to form a terry bib with vinyl backing.  Inwardly, Monica was mortified, but the crowd was in an uproar.  &quot;Now that you&#39;re appropriately dressed, Monica, let me explain some things to you!&quot;, said Madame Illusia.  &quot;Since you so kindly decided to volunteer for my show, I&#39;m going to give you a taste of what I&#39;m going to do to Damon.  Except that he&#39;s smart enough to be a big kid in Pre-K.  Unfortunately for you, Monica, you aren&#39;t so smart!  Don&#39;t worry though, you&#39;ll fit right in with the other boys and girls in your extra special class and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be very good for your teacher as she teaches you how to feed yourself with your hands, teaches you how to sign simple words in baby sign language, and plays special games with you that increases your motor co-ordination skills.  Like Damon, you&#39;ll be intellectually similar to all the other boys and girls at school.  Except that you&#39;ll slowly lose skills over time.  That&#39;s right, you&#39;re going to be taught in reverse until you are wheel chair bound and unable to eat, preferring to be fed a nutrition supplement liquid from a bottle with a nipple instead.  The teacher will even be nice enough to hold the bottle for you since you won&#39;t be able to hold it yourself.  Fortunately, for you, not only will you have the luxury of retaining your physical age, but everyone at the school will just think that you are a seven-year-old with a profound intellectual disability.  And, like Damon, you will only have to be like that while at school with the exception that for you, your transformation will begin the minute you see your bus that comes to pick you up.  Imagine the humility of being helped off the bus by the bus driver&#39;s helper, gaining your high-functioning brain and having to relive the memory of helplessly messing your diaper in front of your peers while your teacher teaches you how to grasp a pre-cut piece of soft hamburger meat that rests on top of your mashed potatoes and gravy.  Now, Monica, let me give you a taste of what&#39;s to come!&quot;  Madame Illusia swished her hand again beginning Monica&#39;s temporary descent into mindlessness.  At first, Monica didn&#39;t feel anything, but suddenly a mild headache overtook her.  At first, she could tell that a few things in her mind were missing like how to make her car go vroom vroom.  But, eventually she lost more and more of her knowledge to the point where she started drooling.  Her eyes had taken on a vacant expression while her posture clearly became more clumsy looking with a bit of a slouch.  Monica had no clue where she was, but she knew one thing, she felt pressure in her bowels.  She lowered herself to a squatting position giving the crowd a peak of her white thick plastic-backed diaper through the leg cuffs of her shorts.  She farted, giving the crowd more entertainment as they once again erupted in laughter.  And finally, her body, without any ability or knowledge to clench her bowels closed pushed out a nice warm soft mushy poo into the seat of her diaper leaving a pungent aroma to fill the room.  Afterwards, Madame Illusia magicked in some rather large plastic blocks and a ring stacker and guided Monica to sit down in front of the toys and play.  &quot;Well, with that sorted out, we can get on with our other guest, Damon!&quot;, announced Madame Illusia.  &quot;Damon, I&#39;m going to give you the same taste for your transformation that I gave Monica so that you can experience what it&#39;s like to be going to your own school.&quot;  With that, Madame swished her hand towards Damon.  Unlike Monica, Damon wasn&#39;t glued to his place and was free to move around.  He watched as his shoes changed from grey to blue, but unlike Monica who got nothing on her shoes, he got pictures of cute puppies with bones in their mouths and the coolest flashing lights he could have.  His T-shirt changed color from simple black to a yellow polo shirt with his name and new school in a blue font stitched in on one side near the top and Pre-K in a red font stitched in the other side also near the top.  The legs of his blue jeans grew shorter and shorter changing to a thin cotton and polyester blend as his leg cuffs finally rested at the half-way point above his knee.  His socks turned from white to yellow with navy blue trim at the top keeping their length at a little bit above the ankle.  Like Monica, Damon&#39;s underwear thickened a little as it lost its fly and gained a couple of layers of semi-thick cloth in the center from front to back, but unlike Monica, his underwear didn&#39;t have a waterproof layer or wetness indicators, though it did retain its white color.  His undies were perfect for big boys like him.  Thirsty enough to take a small wetting, but not thick like Monica&#39;s diaper meaning that if he had an accident, he&#39;d leak through his undies down his shorts and onto the floor.  The thought of that happening made him blush in embarrassment.  Madame Illusia then asked,&quot;Damon, are you ready for the mental changes?&quot;  &quot;Yes, Madame.&quot; Damon replied as the crowd once again laughed.  Madame Illusia swished her hand once again.  The experience of mentally becoming four for Damon was way different from when Monica lost her IQ.  Damon didn&#39;t experience a headache, but instead experienced a happy bubbly feeling as his brain was stripped of its precious knowledge.  He was perfectly content to say bye-bye to adding and subtracting as well as how to read a book or tell time.  When the process was finished, unlike Monica, he had a wide smile and bright eyes.  &quot;Now, Damon, I&#39;m going to show you some toys that you can play with, would you like that?&quot;, asked Madame Illusia.  &quot;Uhuh!&quot;, replied Damon.  Next to where Monica was still happily munching on her plastic ring, Madame Illusia magicked in some toys for Damon to play with.  On a play mat with the image of a race-car track, some wooden cars appeared along with wooden people who were holding racing flags.  There were a few plastic toy signs and cones as well as a plastic gantry for the wooden people to stand on and wave off the race-cars.  For fifteen minutes, Damon gleefully pushed the cars around the play mat making vroom noises.  Madame had taken the pleasure of making Damon deaf to the laughter coming from the crowd so that he could enjoy his time while the crowd watched.  After fifteen minutes, Damon began to feel all bubbly again as his knowledge returned to him in the middle of the race.  &quot;Awe, man!  I was having fun.&quot; exclaimed Damon.  &quot;Well, Damon, maybe they&#39;ll have cars for you to play with at Pre-K.  But, for now, how did you like being mentally four?&quot;, asked Madame.  &quot;I loved it!  I can&#39;t wait to go to Pre-K&quot; shouted Damon excitedly as the crowd bursted in laughter once again.  &quot;Pre-K starts in August.  After you finish your year at Pre-K, I&#39;d like you to return to me here in this tent to reassess if you&#39;d like to change schools.  At that time, you can decide to go to any school you like.  I&#39;m not going to judge you if you decide to remain in Pre-K, nor will I judge you if you go to daycare or college.  You&#39;re also free to opt out of going to school and resuming your normal life if you want.&quot;  Madame Illusia smiled, &quot;Well, I think it&#39;s time to check in on Monica, she&#39;s starting to stink.  Besides, I want to leave what you look like as a four-year-old as a surprise to find out only when you see yourself in a mirror at school. I&#39;m also allowing you to stay in your school uniform that you&#39;re currently dressed in so that you can proudly wear it to show how smart you are.&quot;  Damon simply excitedly shook his head as the crowd erupted yet again.  Madame Illusia then turned towards Monica swishing her hand giving Monica a pounding headache once again.  Monica, after gaining her senses and discovering she was stuck to the floor and spreading the mess in her thick medical grade plastic backed diaper, threw her spittle covered ring onto the floor of the stage and furiously clawed at the snaps of her shorts and opened a couple.  Poking out of the snaps she opened was her diaper and a peak of the wetness indicator indicating that she has indeed peed her diaper.  The sickening stench and the sticky, but slippery slop in her seat confirmed that she&#39;d messed in it as well.  She tried to remove her drool covered bib, but it was stuck.  &quot;So, Monica!, Did you enjoy your temporary vacation from thinking?&quot;, asked Madame Illusia.  &quot;FUCK YOU, BITCH!!!! You&#39;ve ruined my life!!!&quot;, shouted Monica.  &quot;Tsk, tsk, tsk, Monica.  I&#39;ve only given you what you deserve.  You&#39;ll be happy to know that your special school will be open from six in the morning until six at night seven days a week letting you live half your life blissful simplicity.  And because you&#39;re so special, they decided to let you start bright and early tomorrow morning.  By the way you&#39;re progressing, I doubt you&#39;ll ever leave the school.  By the way, if you ever disrespect someone again, yell at them, or physically assault them, you&#39;re going back to your extra special happy place for eight hours until you learn your lesson.  Now, get the hell off my stage.&quot; replied Madame Illusia.  &quot;But, before you go, I&#39;m going to give you the same reward for being my guest as I gave Damon.  You get to wear your extra special clothes, messy diaper and all, home to show everyone how smart you are.  Isn&#39;t that nice?&quot;  Monica only glared while still glued to the floor in her squelching diaper.  &quot;Thank you Madame, you&#39;ve been an unexpected help to me.  I&#39;m sorry about my girlfriend.&quot;, explained Damon in a hushed whisper that only Madame Illusia could hear.  He then walked over to Monica and was able to help her stand up thus freeing her from her spot.  Both boyfriend and girlfriend left the stage and departed the tent to start their new lives, Damon as happy as can be and Monica deeply pissed both in emotion and in her diaper.</p>
