<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The more the day went on, the harder Jeff found it to focus on anything – other than Scott.  Horniness permeated his mind, the longer he was around his boyfriend without touching him.  Dinner with Scott’s family was a study in hell; his family was nice enough, as usual – and Jeff had a standing invitation to eat with them any time.  But everything everyone said seemed to have a double entendre in Jeff’s mind, and he was having an increasingly difficult time keeping his hands off of his boyfriend.  Finally, after dinner, he went into the bathroom, and splashed some cold water on his face.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck is wrong with me?” he asked his reflection in the mirror.  Even his own reflection was getting him horny, looking at his dark bushy hair and – that’s funny, he hadn’t noticed the earrings before, but the hair was long enough that it covered them up easily.  A golden hoop in each ear.  Not that it mattered, he was just surprised he didn’t notice them when he first changed, back in his own bedroom what seemed like weeks ago now.  He tried to remember the settings of the Chronivac; he hadn’t set any delayed changes, had he?  No, he was pretty sure he hadn’t.  So he missed the earrings, considering everything else that happened today, it wasn’t really all that surprising.  “God, get a grip, Jeff.”  Some more cold water, and he wiped himself off and found Scott in a tank and shorts in the hallway, holding a football.<br />
<br />
“Wanna toss the pigskin?”<br />
<br />
Jeff knew Scott was just trying to pass the time, it was probably dragging as much for him as it was for Jeff.  “Sure.”<br />
<br />
Jeff shucked his sneakers at the back door, walking out past the elm into the large, fenced in back yard.  The grass felt good on his big bare feet.  He closed his eyes and inhaled slowly and deeply, truly relaxing for the first time since finding himself dropped unceremoniously into this new reality.  He had many memories of this place (at least in his jock life), spending hours passing a football back and forth with Scotty. He felt so at peace, and truly at home.<br />
<br />
“Lot’s of memories,” Scott commented, walking past Jeff to take his usual position at the other end of the yard.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jeff agreed.  The two played with the ball til it got dark, tossing their shirts aside not long in because the evening was so warm.  The activity had a soothing effect on the both of them.  Just the flow of the familiar.  The feel of the leather ball in the palms of their hands.  They both built up quite a sweat playing, and Jeff found the time had gone by faster than he would have imagined – and though he had moments of appreciating his boyfriend’s big, muscular hairy physique, he was surprised to discover that tossing the ball around had quite effectively distracted him from being a horny mess all evening.<br />
<br />
“That felt good,” Scott ran up, huffing, the thick blonde hair on his chest matted down with sweat, much like Jeff&#39;s own.  Spent, the boys grabbed their shirts and went into the house. Without even thinking, the both of them headed toward the upstairs bathroom to shower together – routine and habit ran deep.  Their shorts slid off, and they both stepped into the large shower, turning on the flow of water from both ends.  Jeff grabbed the soap, and lathered Scotty’s back up like he normally did.  His muscles ached, but it was a good ache, it felt right.<br />
<br />
“Man, did you see Coach chew Marsden out before the game today? I swear, I thought it was going to come to blows.”  They both laughed, and Scott turned around, facing Jeff, offering to take the soap, “Do you’re back?”<br />
<br />
Jeff passed it to him, and turned, still on auto pilot – they had done this a thousand times.  Jeff moaned as Scotty lathered up his back, his strong hands working out the kinks in Jeff&#39;s muscles.  “Mmmm, that feels so good.”  Scotty was being a perfect gentleman, his hands keeping to what he knew were safe zones; he was being a man of his word.  But as often happened, Jeff found himself starting to get hard.  And as quick as that, all of the sexual excitement was back.  Jeff faced Scotty, both of them sporting the biggest boners they had ever had, and in turning the cocks even bumped against one another.  Jeff instinctively grabbed both of their cocks together in his fist.<br />
<br />
Scotty’s expression was unreadable, and he just said weakly, “I’m not trying to seduce you… I’m sorry, I just forgot everything for a while – it was so nice for everything to feel normal again tonight.”<br />
<br />
“I know,” Jeff said with his soft growl.  “It’s okay, you didn’t do anything wrong.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know if I’ll be able to hold back if you…” Scotty’s voice trailed off, and Jeff could feel both of their cocks throbbing like raging engines in his fist.<br />
<br />
“It’s ok, Scotty,” Jeff drew closer to him, water running down their faces from their hair, noses nearly touching.  The sent of soap and sweat was strong.  “Just kiss me.”<br />
<br />
Scotty pulled Jeffy into his arms, Jeff embracing his friend.  Their cocks both stood up, mashed between their hard, hairy abs, bodies pressed together even as their lips met tenderly.  Jeff could feel Scott’s hot breath against his lips as they gazed into one another’s eyes.  Jeff heard himself growl softly, “I love you.”<br />
<br />
With that, Scotty’s lips rubbed gently across Jeff’s, as though tentatively exploring their warm, wet surface.  Then gently meeting.  It felt like it lasted forever and not nearly long enough.  Then their lips parted, both breathing a little heavier now.  The water splashed on their hot skin, trickling down their hairy bodies.  Scotty locked eyes with Jeffy, looking deeply into them.  “I love you too.”<br />
<br />
With that, the two came together and started making out passionately.  Skin on skin.  Hairy body against hairy body.  Lips mashed together, chests pressed in so they could feel one another’s hard nipples.  Wet skin and hair on wet skin and hair.  Their love and lust intertwined and  grew, until they were like beasts, lips locked in the passionate, masculine strength of an unbreakable union they both shared together.  They were more than boys… they were more than jocks or men… they were more than beasts as they made out, muscles rippling, feeling the union of their souls joined in a triumphant crescendo of primal contact beyond mere brotherhood.<br />
<br />
Without even touching their cocks, both came only from the friction of their bodies pressed together in their perfect kiss, and held each other tightly as the water continued to flow down their Greek-god-like bodies.  <br />
<br />
It felt like a moment.  <br />
<br />
It felt like a perfect eternity.  <br />
<br />
Neither wanted to let go.  Neither wanted it to end.  <br />
<br />
So they stayed that way, lost in time, only knowing one another, in this perfect moment.  Only knowing beyond any doubt or question that they were meant for one another.<br />
<br />
They didn’t speak.  There was no need to.  They both knew.  <br />
<br />
They had their answer – the only answer that really mattered.</p>
