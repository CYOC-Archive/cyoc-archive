<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Only some?&quot; Alex asked as they walked through the woods toward where his home was.<br />
<br />
Nate detected a teasing tone in Alex&#39;s voice even as he felt his member rise between his legs. Ben had made mention that were-beasts had a higher libido than normal humans and that they often had a higher interest in sex when the possibility arrived, and now Nate knew that Ben had been right. Nate knew that his engine was already revved up over the victory over Yvette for her invasion of his home, and standing there seeing Alex before him and with his own penis rising from his sheath was enough to get a similar rise out of Nate. He could feel blood flow to his erection as it rose out of his own sheath and stood at attention between his legs. Nate also noted that Alex&#39;s gold eyes were focused on Nate&#39;s rising erection. Eventually Alex reached down and wiggled Nate&#39;s massive erect member, and the contact made Nate smile a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think this would be good for A LOT of fun,&quot; Alex finished his tease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;m good for it,&quot; Nate answered, and moved forward to pull Alex into a hug and began to kiss him. It was awkward given that wolven muzzles weren&#39;t good for kissing, but Nate made do and it allowed him to press his penis against Alex so that he could feel Alex&#39;s erection with his own.  Alex smiled back and kissed him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;In fact... after beating that rogue vixen...&quot; Nate said to Alex, &quot;I kind of need it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let me attend to you,&quot; Alex answered and then stopped.<br />
<br />
Nate watched Alex got down onto his knees in front of him and while he began to gently massage Nate&#39;s furry testicles with his paws he began to wrap his mouth around Nate&#39;s fully erect member. Nate felt a great deal of pride in it, as just as William had found his own equipment greatly enlarged from its human size, Nate&#39;s own penis had grown greatly since he became a werewolf. It was much bigger than before though it had remained largely in proportion to the massive muscular size that his body had grown to when he transformed. And now Alex going down on that massive member and licking all along the shaft with his tongue and doing his best to keep his lips around the outside of Nate&#39;s penis  and at the same time not cutting the sensitive skin with his fangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooohhhhh... ohhhhhhhhhhhhh yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssssssssssss,&quot; Nate gave a low moan and brought his hands around to Alex&#39;s head to hold the other werewolf to him, &quot;Keep doing that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex paused and smiled, &quot;I intend to.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Alex resumed and Nate felt himself quiver as Alex stimulated him. It felt good, and Nate felt excited. Excited by the sexual pleasure he was enjoying but also excited to actually have a partner to be with. Nate had always been gay, he new that, and, unlike Martha who had repressed being bisexual, he had no wish to hide that he was. But things had seemed to conspire to force him to hide things. He had friends in Minnesota, but he&#39;d never found anyone he could date with, and as the drama between his parents began to dominate things in the background, Nate had never been able to truly be open about being gay. But now, in Moon Lake, as a werewolf, Nate was beginning to feel far more confident and proud in it. Though for the moment he had chided himself to accept Frances&#39; advice. <br />
<br />
His parents&#39; relationship was rapidly healing since they became weres, and Nate could even tell that. He could smell clearly that his parents had had sex together when he walked past their bedroom. And through the day, the two of them had seemed rather close and comfortable with each other. It was as if all the old strains were gone, which Nate took as real healing. Their marriage had always been loving and Nate could see that his father and mother were trying to start over and get away from his father&#39;s past mistakes. But there had still been strain between them. His mother not fully trusting his father&#39;s ability to keep his promises and his father feeling strained nearly every outside pressure that they had come across and his own guilt and shame at his mistakes. But now as werefox and werecat, the two of them were rapidly having their marriage heal. That gave Nate some hope, but for the moment, he would remain quiet on the subject until he was sure he wouldn&#39;t break them up by announcing that he was gay.<br />
<br />
He hoped it would be soon, though, as he could then let them know about the sexy werewolf he had agreed to date. The werewolf who had brought him into were-beast society by turning him into a werewolf. Nate felt himself smile as Alex brought him to an orgasm as his penis erupted and Alex was soon swallowing thick ropes of Nate&#39;s cum as his member erupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how did that feel?&quot;  Alex asked him as he licked his muzzle.<br />
<br />
The two kissed again as Alex climbed back to his feet, and Nate could taste the salty taste of his own cum in Alex&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;And I might need more in a bit... but first... let me return the favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Nate got down onto his own knees and began to lick at Alex&#39;s erect shaft. In moments he had Alex&#39;s erection in his mouth in his best effort to get Alex to cum as well. Alex moaned in response and soon brought his hands down to hold Nate&#39;s head down on Alex&#39;s erection. This continued until Alex erupted into his mouth with a triumphant howl as he had his orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was good,&quot; Alex smiled to him, and looked down to see Nate gazing back with hungry eyes and a still hard erection between his legs, &quot;but... I take it you want more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Much more,&quot; Nate growled with a smile and the two of them were soon howling out their own sexual pleasures.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It was five to eleven when Nate made it back to the house after vigorous love-making in the woods with Alex. It had felt quite good got a lot of his burning desires after the battle with Yvette out of him, and he found his wolven form to be surprisingly flexible. To his surprise, the house was quiet. He half expected his parents waiting for him, but they weren&#39;t. He made his way toward the stairs and to go upstairs when he saw a small note taped to the inside of the front door, as though it was expected that Nate would see it there. He approached it and picked it up.<br />
<br />
In his father&#39;s handwriting, it read: &quot;Nate, Eric&#39;s friend Julie invited us over to her house for dinner. There are leftovers in the fridge if you&#39;re hungry, and remember that you have school tomorrow. Mom and Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate looked at that and then shrugged. His folks and Eric had gone out for the night as well, but it was close enough to when he&#39;d need to be in bed that he didn&#39;t ponder it too much. He made his way up the stairs and began to change back. His feet shorted to become the normal pink human feet with no claws. His body shrank down to a more human size and his fur and tail was sucked back inside his skin. His ears rounded and moved back to the sides of his head and his muzzle flattened out into human face with his nose sitting above his mouth. But he wasn&#39;t in the same shape he had been when the Andersons first moved to Moon Lake. He now had well developed pectoral muscles as well as abs that were rock hard. It was great for Nate as he enjoyed one of those benefits of being a werewolf.<br />
<br />
Once he reached the top of the stairs he immediately headed to the bathroom. While Eric might not detect that Nate had gone into the woods to have sex with Alex, his parents would. His father might be able to smell it on him more easily, as cats weren&#39;t renowned for their sense of smell. Cats had a good sense of smell and Nate had no doubt that his mother as a werecat could detect Alex&#39;s scent on him, but he simply figured that his father&#39;s longer werefox muzzle would mean a stronger sense of smell and that he would more easily pick up Alex&#39;s scent. Nate knew he&#39;d need to shower in order to wash off at least most of Alex&#39;s scent. Not to mention that the scent of soap would rub off on him and would help him sell good. <br />
<br />
He turned the tub knob to where the faucet would be discharging warm water. He then set down a bathmat climbed into the tub before drawing the shower curtain across the tub. He felt his body relax as he pulled on the lever to switch the water flow from the tub-faucet to the shower facet and felt warm water roll down his body. It relaxed his muscles and as he began to clean himself off, he began to think over how he would ultimately tell his folks and Eric, as he knew he couldn&#39;t stay in the proverbial closet forever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just saying &quot;I&#39;m gay&quot; would be too open... to blunt,&quot; Nate thought to himself, &quot;Though I may have to say that... I can&#39;t lead with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He paused and rubbed the bar of soap over his body and felt it lather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I could ask dad curiously on how he feels about mom being bi,&quot; Nate wondered quietly, &quot;that could ease things in and wouldn&#39;t sound as if it was about me... but I don&#39;t want to make it look like I&#39;m trying to drive a wedge between. Especially if dad is supportive or is okay with her being bi... Asking would only sound as though I&#39;m anti-gay and trying to get him to hate mom...&quot; Nate paused for a moment and then thought, &quot;THAT would be ironic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I could talk to mom first,&quot; Nate mused to himself after a moment, &quot;She is bi after all and will understand and might even be able get dad to understand... of course there&#39;s still the issue of bringing it up...&quot;<br />
<br />
As he finished shampooing his hair, he sighed and shut off the water and opened the shower curtain to reach for a towel. He still had no real idea on how to bring it up with his folks. He wanted to proclaim it proudly and a good part of him wanted to, but he didn&#39;t want to hurt his parents&#39; marriage and figured he would have to careful with how he did. In the end he figured they&#39;d be supportive, but he also figured it&#39;d potentially cause trouble, and the ways he had thought of to try and get to the subject also had the potential to make things worse for his folks. Once dry he made his way back to his bedroom and climbed under the covers.<br />
<br />
Before he fell asleep he thought, &quot;why are all the ideas to tell them so hard?&quot;</p>
