<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hey, Jamie.” Claire said. You looked up to see your younger sister holding up a black hand mirror that showed your reflection. “Looks good, right?” That shade of black was growing in you as you found a new sort of fascination for the color. It was dull, lifeless and a void that robbed any colors of their impact, yet it spoke to you somehow. Although hesitantly, you replied with a single nod of your head. <br />
<br />
That reflection of yours would stare back at you with the same conflicting face of what had happened. Shifting around as you felt your manhood become stimulated at the feeling of the lacy panties on you, a sense of serene peace became known. Staring at the mirror felt wonderful, like this was where you needed to be. <br />
<br />
The image showed would begin to move. It was slight at first, but soon the picture would begin to swirl around the mirror. Your eyes would follow suit obediently while the world seemed to move in slow motion around you. “Sleep...” Came a voice that sounded like Claire’s. It would have been nice to have seen her, but your eyes would refuse to move. Instead, your eyelids grew heavy and would slowly drop until the image along with everything else had become black. <br />
<br />
You then found yourself surrounded by darkness, a multitude of voices talking all out once. You could tell the girls’ voices apart from others but what they were saying was indecipherable. They spoke such harsh things that would cause you to fall to your knees as they rotated around and around in your brain. <br />
<br />
“Darkness and decay, a new playground.” It was a line from one of the poems you had wrote from a young age as the very topic would seemingly force itself into your mind. You had written poetry and such since the concept was introduced. Such poems and things were natural to you. <br />
<br />
“You can’t color everything black!” Another voice would scold you as lost memories of Gina, that brat from daycare, would yell at you for coloring everything in a single color. The fear that had once gripped you in this unknown void now felt like home. Allowing this fear to drain from you, a hatred of any other color would take its place. The more bright, the worse it would appear. <br />
<br />
Another voice would come forth as you shuddered from just hearing it. “Hey James. Wanna hang after practice?” It was your best friend, Jacob Fullerton, quarterback for the school football team. He was jock but also had a bit of a geeky aside. The two of you hung out every so often and played video games. Deep down, you loved every moment of being with him. His musk he gave off from coming home from a game, how fit he was when you one day stumbled into his house when he was nude. Just thinking about him made your cock stiff in it’s lacy prison. He was still getting used to your new goth persona but you could tell it worried him. <br />
<br />
The voices grew louder as insults and mockeries came from nowhere, all showing their hatred of you. “Freak!” “Weirdo!” “Hey fag!” “Tranny!” Gritting your teeth together as you felt every word mentally wear you down. You had been drawn to dressing like this ever since middle school and managed to pull it off well. Any person you opened up to and shown your secret would turn their back to you except for one. The goth kids seemed to take you in out of pity, allowed you to express yourself while some would rub off on you. <br />
<br />
The voices would soon stop as Claire’s voice would quiet the others. “It’s okay, Jamie. I won’t let anybody make fun of you.” Your dear sister had been the one person who you could trust. You opened up to her about dressing like a girl and becoming a goth. She was so young but understanding. A wonderful sister that you had come to treasure. A feeling of warmth came inside of you as the darkness would fill with light again. Claire’s voice would sound distant. “...amie...Ja...ie...Jamie!” <br />
<br />
Your eyes opened to see all the girls by you. Claire would her your head in her lap while furling your pitch black hair. “Jamie! You okay? You fell down a minute ago and wouldn’t get up.” Sitting up to see your reflection, new thoughts...well, you had always had them. Claire’s bedroom was colored in awful colors, but you kept it to yourself. Not enough black for your taste. “Oh.” Your soft and melancholic voice would be androgynous as it always was. “Thanks, Claire.” Your hand ruffled her hair after getting up back on two feet. <br />
<br />
The reflection showed you in a nice looking outfit you had gotten together for...where was it you were going again? Before you could ask, your sister would look at the clock. “Hey Jamie, it’s almost 9:30 don’t you have some place to be?” Oh crap! You had totally forgotten! You had...</p>
