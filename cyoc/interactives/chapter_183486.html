<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the whiff of tobacco that stirred Chris back to consciousness. Deep annoyance welled within him, Daren had promised him he had given up smoking for good, had even dramtically thrown away his expensive cigars in front of him. He could feel his boyfriend&#39;s warm, clammy skin under the sheets next to him and so he knew Daren was smoking without even caring that he was there!<br />
<br />
But before Chris opened his eyes and began shouting at Daren for his disgusting habit, the memories of yesterday came rushing back. <br />
<br />
Daren&#39;s computer. Daren had headed into work in a hurry and hadn&#39;t logged off his profile on their shared computer. And when Chris had opened it up to use the computer for himself he saw pictures of pubescent adolescents, none of whom were legal, cavorting with other men and boys. He was stunned, convinced it was a mistake, but he began going through Chris&#39;s favorites and saved videos, finding all the proof he needed to find out his boyfriend salivated over teens boys. Daren had returned then, rushing back home after forgetting something at work, only to walk on his emotionally crushed, horrified boyfriend scrolling through his darkest secrets.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d had a blazing row, which consisted mostly of Chris screaming at Daren at how disgusted he was and Daren feebly attempting to turn it around into Chris breaching his privacy. Chris wasn&#39;t having any of it. He stormed out, intent on packing his things and heading back to his parent&#39;s place. Once he was settled in, he&#39;d report Daren to the police. He was a little pained by the prospect but Chris needed to make sure his ex paid for what he did. <br />
<br />
But then there was nothing and then there was last night when Daren had woken him with a passion he hadn&#39;t seen for years, and he had responded with an uncontrollable lust all of his own. Daren had just taken him and then taken him again, and again, and again and he could feel the soft, sweet ache in his ass that testified to that. Much of yesterday was a blur and there were large chunks missing. Had Daren drugged him? Had that been why he&#39;d allowed Daren to ravish him?<br />
<br />
Instead of being at his parent&#39;s, waiting for back from the police to interview whilst planning a future without Daren, he was lying in their shared bed after having been fucked multiple times only a few hours ago and Daren was openly mocking him right next to him. <br />
<br />
Something was wrong. Gently he cracked open one of his eyes just a tiny bit.<br />
<br />
Someone was lying next to him, a smart phone in his left hand that he was engrossed in and a cigar clenched between the masculine fingers of his right which he occasionally brought to his mouth for a long drag. This someone had the body and physique of a greek god or a top line model, all bronze skin and lean, rippling muscles. Chris&#39;s dick immediately stiffened at the intoxicating sight of him, he wanted to lie here and drink it all in but one question gnawed at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the fuck are you. What&#39;s going on?&quot;. The man turned his head towards him, a long stream of smoke exhaling from his nostrils in Chris&#39;s direction, causing him to gag slightly on the noxious fumes. <br />
<br />
As he did so, he realised two things.<br />
<br />
The first was that his own voice had changed, becoming higher in pitch and softer.<br />
<br />
The second was that this unbelievably handsome specimen was definitely, recognisably Daren, as if someone had resculpted a perfect Daren out of an imperfect starting point. Daren said &quot;Good morning babe&quot;, emphasising the last word and smiling as if he just won the lottery. He reached one of those large hands out towards Chris.<br />
<br />
Chris panicked, he flung back the covers of the bed and put distance between himself and Daren. &quot;What the fuck is going on Daren? What happened to you?&quot;. He reached both hands up his throat. &quot;What&#39;s happened to me?&quot; he said plaintitively.<br />
<br />
Daren just smiled and unwound himself from the tangled sheets to stand on the other side of the bed. Daren was bigger everywhere and he moved with a swagger and confidence he hadn&#39;t had before. &quot;What&#39;s happened?&quot; he asked rhetorically. &quot;What&#39;s happened is that there have been a few changes round here, and they&#39;re all for the better&quot;. Daren started coming around the side of the bed and Chris panicked, he turned around and grabbed the knob of the door to the room with both hands.<br />
<br />
His hands, he stopped in shock, they were now delicate things, skin the colour of milk, with long and feminine fingers. The door knob was higher than it should be. In fact, everything in the room was out of place. The shelves were just beyond his reach, the bedside table stood higher than it should and the mirror...the mirror...<br />
<br />
The mirror contained the image of a frightened adolescent, buck naked with the rake thin body of an underfed model and looking as delicate as a glass figurine. The image looked at him with wide, wet eyes surrounded by sweat sodden rose coloured hair.  He approached the mirror to grow closer to that image, and the image similarly grew in size as he approached, mimicing his movements.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Chris almost sobbed, pressing one of his soft and delicate hands over his ruby lips to stifle his little noises. &quot;No, no, no, no, no!&quot; He pressed his hand against the flat, cool surface of the mirror, to prove it was real. He felt the furnace behind as strong, impossibly masculine arms slid around him and drew him into an inescapable embrace. He felt the throbbing length of an engorged penis slide up the crevice of his ass, coating the fleshy sides with sticky pre-cum before it came to rest at the base of his spine. He felt plush lips pressing hungrily into the nape of his neck, and the sickening smell of tobacco wafting over him. &quot;What have you done to me?&quot; Chris said at last.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve perfected us both&quot; Daren said between gentle kisses along the length of his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not possible&quot; Chris responded. &quot;You can&#39;t just change people as if you were some kind of wizard&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I am a Wizard&quot; Daren said, holding Chris tighter. &quot;You like wizards and all that world of warcraft shit Chris, wouldn&#39;t it be a turn on for a little faggy boy to be owned by a big strong wizard like me&quot;. <br />
<br />
Chris flushed red with anger and shouted &quot;I am not a little faggy boy!&quot;. He struggled to break free, but this weak form had little to no strength and Daren easily held him. In the mirror he saw the reflection of Daren&#39;s face split by a cheesy grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are&quot; Daren said in a mocking voice, &quot;and yes you are turned on&quot;. Daren was looking at Chris&#39;s crotch in the mirror, and Chris looked down to see his relatively small dick standing to attention and leaking pre-cum. &quot;Little faggy boy loves being manhandled&quot; said Daren as he reached around and grabbed Chris&#39;s dick in his firm grasp before giving it a couple of quick tugs. It didn&#39;t take much for Chris to let go and leaves spurts of sticky cum on the mirror surface. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not a wizard&quot; he panted. Daren just shrugged. &quot;Fair enough, I&#39;m not a Wizard. But I may as well be&quot;. He went do the bedside locker and retreived his phone. &quot;I used this&quot; he said, holding the screen of the phone in front of his face. At the top of the screen was a logo reading &#39;Chronivac&#39;, below there was an avatar of Chris in his new body. &quot;It&#39;s a reality editor, allows me to change anything I want about the pair of us. Spent all of yesteday learning how it works on the computer, see you find the statistic you want like age or weight on the slider like so..&quot; and he dragged his finger across the weight slider, causing the avatar of Chris to balloon, &quot;and then to finish off you click the apply button&quot;. He made a show of hovering his pinky over the apply button, distressing Chris, before he discarded the changes with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you can change me back with that?&quot; Chris said immediately. <br />
Daren nodded, &quot;If I wanted to, yes. But I don&#39;t want to. In fact, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever want to&quot;.<br />
<br />
Chris&#39;s face fell. His ex was going to leave him trapped him in this frail body. He had to figure out a way to get that phone off of him, get access to the program and turn the tables. But how long was that going to take? How long would he have to bide his time?<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris is obvious you are thinking about stealing the phone at the first opportunity or accessing the computer when my back is turned so I am going to show you something&quot;. He took Chris&#39;s hand and slipped the phone into it. It showed his physical stats, including his age. The bastard had turned him into a sixteen year old! &quot;So just change the settings as you wish and click the apply button. I&#39;m giving you one chance. So go ahead&quot;. He moved away from Chris and sat on the bed.<br />
<br />
What was he playing at? Still, this was the only opportunity he could get to undo this. Chris moved his hand over the screen, ready to drag the slider with his pinky and he found that he couldn&#39;t. He couldn&#39;t bring his pinky to the screen or the screen to his pinky. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, why can&#39;t I touch it?&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Daren just smiled. He stood there for five minutes, willing himself to begin making changes, but something was preventing his body from obeying that specific command. He only stopped after Daren had yanked the device from his grip. He looked at it, desperate to retrieve it but knowing he was incapable of doing so. &quot;You mustn&#39;t want to change back then&quot; he smirked triumphantly. &quot;That&#39;s fine babe. I can use it for the both of us, I mean, watch this.&quot; His finger slipped across the age slider again and Chris watched in horror as Daren slid it down from sixteen to thirteen. The Avatar morphed, losing mass, losing height and growing even softer. It looked like Daren&#39;s ultimate fantasy. &quot;Please don&#39;t&quot; he whispered. &quot;Sorry what?&quot; Daren said as he pushed the apply button.<br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t really a sensation, no dwindling of muscles, no reconfiguration of bone, the room merely expanded in all directions a bit as Chris went from a sixteen year old to a thirteen year old. He felt alone and scared, but also painfully aroused at Daren&#39;s perfect form sitting before him. Daren tugged on his skinny arm to draw him closer. &quot;Do you want this&quot; he said, pointing at the engorged cock that was standing to attention, his ribbed abdomen framing it.&quot;It looks good doesn&#39;t it&quot; Daren said breathlessly. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to be a good boy and give it a lick?&quot;<br />
<br />
He did want to give it a lick. He badly wanted to bring into his mouth and suck on it. But that was what Daren wanted. &quot;No!&quot; he exclaimed panting heavily, trying to break free of his vice like grip. &quot;Then what do you want, babe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want my Mum! I want my Dad&quot; he said. He needed them. They would come. They would save him and they would protect him and they would make Daren put him back to normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that&#39;s not a bad idea&quot; Daren said, and with his free hand he closed out of the Chronivac program and dialled up someone using a video call. In a few moments Chris&#39;s bespectacled mother filled the screen. &quot;Oh good morning boys! How are you both this morning!<br />
<br />
Chris could see from the inset widow that his mother was seeing him, naked and thirteen years old, in the grasp of an older, bigger and obviously sexually aroused man. The adult part of him knew then that whatever weird magic Daren had employed was affecing everyone, but the kid part of him still had to try. &quot;Mum, help! It&#39;s Daren, he&#39;s changed me into a little boy! Mum please, you&#39;ve got to help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh calm down Christopher, you&#39;re being hysterical. Good morning Daren, how are you today&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am feeling great Mrs. Shimizu. Chris is just about to give me a blow job and he&#39;s doing such a good job now he wanted you to see. Is Mr. Shimizu available as well?&#39;<br />
<br />
She frowned, &quot;No, he&#39;s going out to buy the papers but I&#39;ll tell you what I&#39;ll record it so I can show him when I come back&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris was mortified. His own mother was going to watch him give his boyfriend a blow job in a thirteen year old body and it was the most normal thing in the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds fantastic Mrs.Shimizu. Well come on Chris, show your mother what a good boy you can be&quot;. Darren reached out and turned him around and drew him close so that that throbbing, pulsing cock filled his vision. The soft, spongy head touched his lips. He did want it, he wanted it badly. He knelt on the floor, his knees grazing the rough carpert and his lips parted and allowed the massive bronze organ to slip into the soft wetness of his mouth. <br />
<br />
Once again the smell of tobacco filled his nostrils, and as he sloppily chugged up and down the dick&#39;s length he looked up with puppy dog eyes at Daren. Amber-brown eyes looked down imperiously upon him, another cigar chomped between his plump lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not a good habit Daren you know&quot; Mrs. Shimizu said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Mrs. Shimizu&quot; he responded &quot;but it&#39;s a small pleasure&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; she said, not sounding convinced &quot;but it&#39;s a bad example for my Chrissy. I don&#39;t want him to grow up and start smoking&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry Mrs. Shimizu&quot; Daren said and then he bucked once, twice, three times as Chris&#39;s slick tongue tickled his cockhead in just the right sport. The sheer amount of jism spilled out over Chris, coating his face and his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think Chris growing up to start smoking is going to be an issue. And besides,&quot; he said as he turned again to look down on his jism covered partner. &quot;I don&#39;t think Chris would go behind my back to start. He knows that I&#39;m the man, and that&#39;s the boy&quot;.</p>
