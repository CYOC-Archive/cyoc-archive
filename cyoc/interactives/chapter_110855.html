<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Vince came to he found himself standing up. He shivered, it was ridiculously cold in here. Rubbing his eyes, he began to look around his surroundings to find he was standing in the empty school cafeteria, the clock on the wall read 12:25PM. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell? What am I doin&#39; here? I gotta get to cleaning or Principal Jefferson will get on my ass for slacking on the job.&quot; Immediately the thought of the tall, slightly husky, older administrator pounding his asshole came to mind and Vince felt hazy, his sexual desire for the principal&#39;s meat in his ass clouding his thoughts. Suddenly the school bell rang, snapping him out of his stupor and reminding him of his mission. He moved to step forward but felt a sudden tugging on his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the-&quot; Upon closer examination of himself and what was keeping him from his janitorial duties was the realization of what he was wearing, or. . . wasn&#39;t wearing. Looking down, He had two swollen breasts sitting upon a metal lunch tray that rested on top of his trusty trash can. Milk leaked out of his long, hard nipples as hormones continued to be pumped into his anus. His member was fully erect and leaking. . . something as he stood there with hormones flooding his system. He experimentally touched one of his nipples only to find himself moaning in pleasure as milk continued to leak out of it. he also felt an ice cold liquid pooling at his feet, coming out of his erect penis. His backpack had two hoses coming out of it, one feeding into his rectum and the other leading back into the kitchen, which was pulled taught, preventing him from moving forward any further. Before he could make any sense of the situation, students started to flood into the cafeteria, it was Lunch time. <br />
<br />
As the students swarmed in for their first break in classes for the day, Vince began to panic, trying to cover his nipples and manhood only to stumble as his udders sloshed about on the tray. Principle Jefferson began to approach Vince which only lead him into an even more panicked state of mind as he frantically tried to turn and hide himself. As he turned, his breasts slid off of the tray and he lost all control of his body, falling forward towards the ground when he suddenly felt two very firm, warm hands wrapped around his arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woa there old girl, don&#39;t need you breaking on the first day of duty,&quot; Mr. Jefferson chuckled.<br />
<br />
Vince was beyond confused as Mr. Jefferson pulled him up to his feet and gingerly set each of Vince&#39;s breasts atop the metal tray.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t hold this with both hands you&#39;re going to lose your balance there. I thought you would be less clumsy than this!&quot; he continued to chuckle to himself as he patted Vince&#39;s swollen breasts before squatting down below Vince&#39;s waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just going to have water today if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m not much of a milk drinker these days. . . &quot; He continued as Vince gasped as he suddenly felt two lips wrap around the head of his penis. He felt like he was ejaculating but his semen was ice cold and endless. Mr. Jefferson began to suck on his erect member until his thirst was sated and got up to wipe his mouth off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Man, you sure beat the water fountains in this school, something about your water just tastes so much better! Good work, just make it through lunch and I can take you in my office and explain your duties here at HarkinDale High,&quot; he patted one of Vince&#39;s breasts before walking away sending ripples through the milk-rich sacks of flesh.<br />
<br />
A number of students came up with their glasses and filled them up by tugging on Vince&#39;s titties. His left one gave normal milk while his right nipple gave chocolate milk. He also realized that his penis gave ice-cold water. He would occasionally moan as students tugged on his breasts and pull on his penis. It honestly wasn&#39;t all too bad as long as he didn&#39;t think about the fact that he had no idea how he got here or what the hell was going on.<br />
<br />
The constant line of students was interrupted by the presence of Ms. Eber: a middle aged woman that didn&#39;t let her age define her body. She was the &quot;milf&quot; of the school and students and teachers alike simple gawked at her and used her in their personal fantasies, Vince included. The difference was, Vince actually knew her pretty well and struck up many a conversation with her as she spent late evenings grading essays as her students were preparing for Advanced Placement exams. He really liked her and was on the verge of asking her out on a date until. . . this shit happened.<br />
<br />
As Ms. Eber came up for her turn, she tugged on his right nipple with indifference before he mustered the courage to speak to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ms. Eber, remember me? I used to clean your room and we talked all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her face went from general indifference to almost disgust as she responded, &quot;Milk-Men shouldn&#39;t talk to people on the job. It is bad practice.&quot; Before turning and briskly walking away.<br />
<br />
Something wasn&#39;t right, people don&#39;t even seem to be recognizing that he&#39;s even a human being anymore. This was getting weird.<br />
<br />
As lunch came to a close, Mr. Jefferson came up once again and sucked a little on his right teat before saying with a smile, &quot;I might not like milk all too much, but chocolate has be my choice if I don&#39;t have any other.&quot; He grinned before tweaking Vince&#39;s nipple and unplugging his backpack from the hormone machine.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you would follow me to the front office, we can go over your duties as a new service at this school.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mr. Jefferson walked away, Vince had no choice but follow him. As he did though, he did happen to notice the way Mr. Jefferson&#39;s khaki&#39;s tightly hugged his rear. While not toned, his plump butt was defined and highlighted in these pants and Vince&#39;s gaze never left them as they approached the front office. His pants were pulled up just right that the middle seam seemed to split the individual cheeks as he walked in front of him. Maybe this new job wouldn&#39;t be so bad after all.</p>
