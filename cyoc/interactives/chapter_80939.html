<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Earlier that night, while everyone was watching some cheesy reality show and Bryan kept complaining about how <br />
thin the people were, Mark excused himself to go to the bathroom. But really it was just a cover-up to sneak <br />
into his dad's bedroom to use the Chronivac. It had been playing on his mind just how powerful this machine <br />
was. Whatever change he wanted to make, it had to be quick or else they might get suspicious downstairs. It <br />
booted up quickly and showed the last change made, him becoming part of the family. He navigated through the <br />
reality related pages before quickly coming across what he wanted, the ALTERED REALITY ADJUSTMENTS options. <br />
Jay had shown it to him earlier, to prove that he'd tampered with the temporal qualities of the world, <br />
everyone now aging at a rate of 5 years every day, and nobody seemed to notice. But come to think of it, Mark <br />
had been paying attention to everyone around town throughout the day and noticed that nobody else seemed to be <br />
aging, only his new family. The friends he had back in high school were still in high school, while he had <br />
graduated and got a job in hours. However he was already aging before Jay had shown the device. Perhaps the <br />
Chronivac was sentient, knowing he was going to eventually join the family and prepared him for the change <br />
before they'd even been introduced. The thoughts made his head hurt. It didn't matter how it worked, as long <br />
as it did. <br />
<br />
He'd already been upstairs longer than he intended, so he had to make this quick. Mark clicked on the option <br />
titled Temporal Flow, and a box appeared that said &quot;1 DAY = 5 YEARS&quot;, along with a few sliders. He meddled <br />
with the sliders a bit to see what they did, before eventually settling on &quot;1 DAY = 10 YEARS&quot;. That sounded <br />
just about right, wanting to age even more over the next couple of days. But Jay might become suspicious once <br />
he realises he was 32 by the end of the day instead of 27, so Mark clicked on the advanced options, finding a <br />
whole array of limitations he could induce. Sure enough, one of the ticked boxes said &quot;ONLY APPLY TO CHRONIVAC <br />
USERS IN DATABASE&quot;. He didn't want to untick that, not wanting to be the cause of a global massacre of elderly <br />
people. Then he thought about his grandfather. He was already in bad health at the moment, his heart problems <br />
didn't seemed to be improving. Maybe he shouldn't continue with this. Glancing over the options to see if he <br />
could find a way to not include his grandpa, he spotted another box. &quot;TIME ACCELERATION WILL NOT LEAD TO <br />
DEATH&quot;. It was currently unticked. That sounded like a solution for the time being, clicking on the box. If <br />
anything were to happen, Mark could always get back to the Chronivac and fix things. <br />
<br />
Finally he found the section titled &quot;AWARENESS OF TEMPORAL FLOW EFFECTS&quot;. There were sliders for how aware <br />
people were of the time acceleration. Worldwide awareness was all the way to the left, signalling that nobody <br />
would notice them aging. Bryan's awareness was also at the same point. Simon's awareness was under halfway, <br />
making him notice something was wrong but not enough for him to question it. Mark and Jay's sliders were on <br />
the opposite side, making them both aware of the acceleration in time. He grabbed Jay's slider with the mouse <br />
and dragged it to a similar point that Simon's was, figuring he didn't to make him completely unaware of what <br />
was going on, especially because he was the one to make the change in the first place. Making one final check <br />
over the options he'd selected, he noticed a timer that, once reaching the end of its countdown, would <br />
initiate the changes. Looking at his watch, he decided to set the timer so the changes he made would start at <br />
midnight. <br />
<br />
Mark was finally finished with his meddling and hit enter. The timer appeared on the screen, counting down to <br />
midnight. Pleased with what he'd done, he left the room and finally went to the bathroom, wanting to relieve <br />
his bladder after his nerves built up with the excitement. He flushed the chain and grabbed a nearby air <br />
freshener, spraying to cover up a non-existent smell. He went to the sink and splashed water on his face to <br />
calm himself down. His stared at his face, taking in his trimmed beard and receding hair, wondering how <br />
different he'd look come tomorrow. Mark made his way back downstairs, hearing his grandfather still moaning <br />
about the show. &quot;..ing that she'd look better with a bit more meat on her bones!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we heard you the first time. You don't need to keep saying it&quot; Jay sounded a bit annoyed at his <br />
grandfather's persistence on the matter. It's not like he could change it. Well he possibly could with the <br />
Chronivac, but he didn't want to. He heard his brother come into the room. &quot;Hey, you're back. You were up <br />
there for a while. Hopefully you didn't stink the place out&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I sprayed the stuff. Like you can complain anyway, yours smell like somebody died&quot;. They all laughed and <br />
got back to watching the TV. At midnight, the Chronivac the timer reached its end and the words &quot;COUNTDOWN <br />
COMPLETE. INITIATING RIPPLE EFFECT. PLEASE STAND BY...&quot; flashed up on the bright screen lighting up the room. <br />
A pulse of energy escaped outwards from it, managing not to disturb Simon who was fast asleep, out cold for <br />
the night. The Chronivac eventually switched off, letting darkness envelope the room again.</p>
