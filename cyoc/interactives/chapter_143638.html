<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter is MOSTLY done by LeezardMan. All framework is rightfully theirs. My contribution for this chapter was that I supplied the ideas that could be used and completely rewriting everything for it to flow better.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica awoke with a start, remembering her sudden fall that was partially her own fault. She quickly sat up, suppressing a scream when she found herself surrounded by the latex monsters that had chased her.  <br />
 <br />
She covered her mouth in shock when the monsters made motions to stay quiet, her own surprise and curiosity overwhelming her need to shout for help. It was that moment of silence that she could hear the squeaky footsteps just outside the door. She locked eyes with the white tiger, its muscular body tensed and taut, ready to lunge towards whoever that would enter that door.  <br />
 <br />
Thankfully, the squeaky footsteps goes further away and finally disappeared. The monsters give off a relieved sigh, being that no further conflict arose. She followed the sighs, seeing a curvaceous and leaking purple lizard-woman and another yellowish gold and lithe yet muscular snake-man staring at her, creeping her out.  <br />
 <br />
Jessica contemplated her situation, trying her hardest not to panic and hyperventilate. They seemed different to the wolf from earlier. Truth to be honest, they seemed… <br />
 <br />
...almost, &#8203;<i>human</i>… <br />
<br />
 The tiger locked eyes with her, his irises glowing from their reflective properties and her breath hitched within her throat. The tiger, seeing her distress and noticeably changing expression, simply stayed put. <br />
<br />
 “...Don’t worry… You’re safe now.” The tiger spoke calmly. She perked up when she heard, &#8203;truly heard his voice. It sounded so… &#8203;<i>familiar</i>. <br />
<br />
 “You probably can’t even recognize me at all, can you?” His ears drooped when she shook her head.  <br />
 <br />
“I don’t ever remember having a monster made of rubber as a &#8203;friend” She spoke unerringly calm, prompting the tiger to flinch. “Especially since one of your brethren ate my friend.. I’m sure Alex is gone too, isn’t he?” <br />
 <br />
The tiger seemed saddened, breaking eye contact and instead staring at the carpeted floor. The other two reptilian monsters looked at his sad state, empathizing in silence. <br />
<br />
 “Are you going to turn &#8203;me too?” Her voice trembled upon asking that, remembering her friend’s fate. The tiger shook his head, gripping at the carpet. <br />
 <br />
“I would never… Not you, Jessie.” Spoke the tiger softly.  <br />
 <br />
Eyes widening, she backed away. She had heard someone calling her name, and only two others alongside her own family could call her that. <br />
 <br />
Which meant that this latex animal man was the one that had called her? “Who are you?!” She hissed, suddenly angry and yet fearful. She glared at the tiger-man, him suddenly ducking his head as if found guilty. “Where did you learn that name!”  <br />
 <br />
The tiger made a move to speak but she was on a roll. “Did you force it out of Alex? Did you <i>know</i> we were coming?” <br />
<br />
The white tiger frantically shook his head, hands trying to placate her anger. She stopped, intent on listening this monster’s plea. <br />
 <br />
The white tiger surveyed her reaction, before taking a deep breath. He locked eyes with hers, before uttering. <br />
 <br />
“...I’m Alex…” The white tiger averts his eyes, as if ashamed to reveal that. Jessica couldn’t process what she just heard. <br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, &#8203;<i>what</i>?” She stared hard, and the white tiger seemed to shrink into himself. He faced her again, now slightly grinning. <br />
<br />
“In 8th grade, you gave the most popular kid in our class a love letter for Valentine&#39;s Day. He gave it to friend who ended up telling the whole class you liked him. Then you ran out of the classroom and skipped school for a whole week.”<br />
<br />
The tiger seemed to smirk, a smug grin plastered on his face. Jessica could feel the embarrassment flowing up her face, no doubt making her face red. The white tiger grinned when her own jaws fell open in shock. <br />
 <br />
“Now do you believe I’m Alex?” He smugly smiled, half lidded eyes looking expectantly. That smile fell when he heard quiet sobbing. “Jessie, you’re... you&#39;re crying?” <br />
 <br />
She nodded, unable to break sight as tears fell from her eyes. She couldn’t help it. <br />
 <br />
“Alex… God…” She whispered, unable to believe it. She stared down, unable to face her shame. <br />
<br />
“Should have never made such a &#8203;<i>stupid</i> dare… Now look at the consequences…” Alex tilted his head in confusion. <br />
<br />
“You’ve been turned into some latex tiger &#8203;freak! Your humanity just up and gone! &#8203;Your life will never be the same!” Jessica sobbed harder into her own knees, trying to hide herself. <br />
<br />
“And it’s all because of a &#8203;<i>stupid</i> <em>bet</em>!” She closed her eyes harder, repeatedly slamming her head onto her knees in regret. <br />
 <br />
“It’s alright, it’s alright....” Alex inched closer, before hugging her completely in his hold, rubbing circles on her back with his clawed hands. “I’m here, I’m still me…” <br />
 <br />
You and Sam stared on in complete silence, not knowing what to do. The room was silent save for some quiet sobs from the girl. <br />
 <br />
“You purr…” She quietly muttered, pressing her head into the chest of the muscled up tiger. Alex seemed stunned, before chuckling. “It seems I do…”  <br />
 <br />
A few minutes pass before they separated, emotions finally set to rest.  <br />
 <br />
She glances towards both reptilian creatures. “So… Who are your new friends?” <br />
 <br />
Alex smiled, seeing the opportunity. He made a move to address Sam but was immediately cut off. <br />
 <br />
“Samantha, you can call me Sam.” She smirked as Alex glared playfully at her, before turning to the gold snake. “That one is Martin. He can’t speak for some reason.” <br />
<br />
 You give a hopefully non-threatening smile and a small wave. “<i>&#8203;Sup.</i>” <br />
 <br />
She waved back and then wiped her leftover tears. <br />
 <br />
“He was the one that saved me when I first came into the mansion.” Alex rubbed his head in embarrassment. “He was also the one to change me into this form when I was partially changed by an evil dragon.” <br />
 <br />
“Wait wait <i>wait</i>. You were changed by him?” She glared at you, suddenly angry. You try to hiss something to defend yourself, but Alex comes to your rescue. “Wait no! He saved me. You see, his latex is the good latex. I was infected with the bad latex that would have made me sex crazed!” <br />
 <br />
“Sex <i>crazed</i>?!” Shocked, she accidentally looked down. Her face instantly turned a shade of red as she jumped, turning and covered her face with a squeal. <br />
 <br />
“What are you…” Alex also looked down, seeing his rather well endowed cat cock and balls in full display and on half mast. He, suddenly smelling her arousal, suddenly went harder. He covered his genitals, unable to stop it as it pulsed.  <br />
 <br />
Stifling his moan, Alex couldn’t help but stare at Jessie, finding her skintight ripped jeans and obviously a size too small sweater quite arousing. He seemed to start growling, trying really hard to suppress his rising feeling, of &#8203;need, to just lunge on her and ravage her up. <br />
 <br />
He caught himself, suddenly aware of what he had thought of. <br />
 <br />
“Bloody hell.” Sam cursed as she used her tail to cover her slit and using her hands for her breasts.  <br />
 <br />
You were confused at first, but upon smelling the hormones and the odd feral musk coming from Alex, you realize that you’re all buck naked. Using your massively long tail, you cover your twin dicks in an act of modesty. <br />
 <br />
Being naked for so long had made you forget that you were supposed to not be naked. <br />
 <br />
While both you and Sam were clearly old enough for your hormones to be fully developed, Alex and Jessie were both still teenagers, and with that...  <br />
<br />
An awkward silence hung over the room. No one spoke.  <br />
 <br />
“Uh, Jessie, I think we’re all, <i>grr</i>, great..” Alex caught himself from growling, the teen looking up with her blush still there. <br />
 <br />
“What happened to Tyson?” Alex quickly asked to divert attention from the embarrassing situation, and his. <br />
 <br />
Jessie closed her eyes, her lips quivering. She took in her breath and steadied herself.  <br />
<br />
“You were gone for quite a while, so Tyson and I decided we&#39;d come into this mansion to find you and bring you home...” She paused, trembling. <br />
<br />
“But then, that scary purple wolf man found us.” Alex clenched his teeth and you pressed your mouth into a thin line. <br />
<br />
“When we saw him we didn&#39;t know what to do. So we ran. But he was so fast…” She hugged herself, suddenly regretting her scaredy cat nature. “Being in cross country, I&#39;m a runner.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tyson isn&#39;t...” Again, she paused to fully recollect her memories. <br />
 <br />
She trembled. “I saw the wolf..” She gulped, uncomfortable. “It ate Tyson whole. Gulped him up like nothing.” <br />
 <br />
Alex clenched his fist bulging and rightfully angry.<br />
 <br />
“I ran away, the wolf just slower now that it got Tyson.” Her eyes began to water, remembering everything so, &#8203;so vividly. <br />
<br />
 “Then the wolf just stopped and the front part of his chest was, like, bulging.” She shivered at the memory. “The purple wolf’s front body just like expanded, and it was howling like hell, panting and all.” <br />
 <br />
“I saw something brown just plop off the wolf, before reforming into another one of them… An eagle..” <br />
<br />
&#8203;She teared up, knowing who the eagle was, and her next action. <br />
 <br />
“I just turned, and ran away.” She began to sob. “I didn’t even look back. All I heard was howling and screeching.” <br />
 <br />
Alex turned towards you, nodding. Sam seemed angry, knowing full well what her ex-boyfriend had done. <br />
 <br />
All three of you now hated the lupine creature even more now. Alex turned towards the sobbing girl, reassuring her. “Don’t worry. We’ll save Tyson. Martin can bring him back.” <br />
 <br />
Jessica nodded, wiping her tears away. She looked to her now muscular white tiger friend, reassured. “Let’s find Tyson.”</p>
