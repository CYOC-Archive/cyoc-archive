<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jensen didn't tell his pack that he was leaving the grounds, he didn't want to remind them <br />
it had taken one old man to chip the tooth of their Alpha Male. As far as he was concerned, <br />
he was going to be a simple outing across town and back.  He was just lucky the family <br />
dentist had a cancelation. <br />
<br />
Isabelle, the dark chocolate color version of Kaylee followed behind. She was still <br />
disappointed that she couldn't have been given a  figure like the twins, but now her body <br />
was a recolored replica of Alpha Females, only features that made her seem like a game <br />
sprite pallet swap mark her as an individual.  Isabelle had never once minded her full <br />
figure, and considered herself in decent shape (he wouldn't have been part of Jennifer <br />
entourage if she wasn't), but seeing the two towering blond wolf women had thrown her <br />
for a loop. <br />
<br />
It felt awkward now walking behind Jensen. The twins on their own insistence escorted the <br />
Master the all the way to the front gate, leaving his side only when he walked out. <br />
<br />
Kaylee personally had wanted to go with Master herself, but figured more wolves would get <br />
more attention, which the pack didn't need, and her alt-copy had her turn still while <br />
Kaylee herself did not. This of course left Kaylee in charge while Jensen left the protective <br />
grounds of his loyal pack and the deadly 'gargoyles.' <br />
<br />
Kaylee in the tea room that had become the 'roman letters' official unoffical meeting spot, <br />
spoke to her two remaining doubles, Grace and Hope. &quot;Tell me everything there is to know <br />
about Master's likes and dislikes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Grace and Hope looked at each other and nodded.  Kaylee just hoped whatever had gotten <br />
Zack's butt kicked hadn't rendered him useless as a distraction for the other females from <br />
Master. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Nick had done as Nicole had asked (ordered), and had begun to look for information on <br />
body building for the other males. He had come to the study, looked around for thirty <br />
seconds, then went to the office only to find the computer in use by the shadows who had <br />
no time or reason to let him use it. Not wanting to go crawling to the Master's pups, Nick <br />
drudged back to the study, looking at all the books again and sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to take a -loooong- time.&quot; It didn't help matters he had no idea how to use <br />
an index, and hadn't been inside a library since before collage. <br />
<br />
Feeling crest fallen, but doing as he had been told to do as all the lesser males were <br />
expected to do of any of the females Nick began the long and very UN-erogenous task <br />
ahead of him. 'She could have told me to get some body building books for ladies at least <br />
while she was at it.' Nick thought as he began to go through the title of the impressive <br />
collection of books kept mostly as a status symbol but thankfully untouched during the <br />
'clean out.' <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Zack was not happy. Everything had come crashing down around his ears. He hadn't <br />
expected the she-wolves to be so defensive of the effeminant males and the boy. After all, <br />
Jennifer had always encourage Zylphia and the others to not even bother with guys who <br />
looked and sounded girlie.   Apparently this hadn't translated to the she-wolves created to <br />
serve Jennifer as Jensen. <br />
<br />
'Dammit, everything ruined. How could I have miscalculated this badly?! Nick is a walking <br />
libido! Even I could see that! Lawrence and Roger have nowhere the drive he does, and <br />
Ulysses isn't even an adult male! I figured he'd be the easiest to befriend.... guess he <br />
already gave his wolfhood to that she-wolf. And to make matters worse, one of the <br />
females has swore herself off me forever. And I thought it was the brothers who were <br />
supposed to get angry at a slight against their sibling.  This is a disaster.'  <br />
<br />
He had entered the male's den, Roger and Lawrence saw his sad state, made a few <br />
chuckles among themselves over Zack's apparent shot down after attempting to butter up <br />
Nick by casting them both in a superior light to the plain green and white male wolves. <br />
<br />
Zack had endured it for all of five minutes before he left to find somewhere else to nurse <br />
his wounded pride.  And the worst of the worst, he had lost his turn! And those with the <br />
power of the game, the she wolves, had apparently banded against him.... 'I'd say this day <br />
can't get any worse, but I know how that would turn out.' <br />
<br />
Of course all the doors in the house were gone apparently save for the cubs room, making <br />
any sort of complete privacy pretty much impossible. He considered going outside, but <br />
simply didn't feel like it.   He was a big bad wolf after all.. he did have his pride. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen had proven to be able to move quite fast in spite of his injured leg, and Isabelle was <br />
easily able to keep up. As was becoming simply expected, people gave Jensen and Isabelle <br />
the odd glance, but no one screamed, ran or called animal control or even the police for <br />
someone committing public nudity. <br />
<br />
Even a bus load of tourists gave Jensen and Isabelle more than a few snap shots that would <br />
ultimately appear on a couple werewolf and furry websites but little else. The tabloids <br />
wouldn't even blink at the perfectly logical scoop. <br />
<br />
Isabelle did her best to shadow Master and keep an eye for anyone or anything that might <br />
try to take advantage of him in his slightly wounded state. One thing she was enjoying was <br />
all the looks she was getting.  It was like the entire town had turned into high school but <br />
without the tests. <br />
<br />
The wolves were fast, and while Jensen was starting to get hungry, he of course was as <br />
naked as Isabelle and found clothing strangely unpleasing now, and he seriously doubted <br />
unlike his dentist a food-stand wasn't like to just foreword the bill to Bart and Jenny. <br />
<br />
Everywhere Jensen went however, people gave him instant fear, respect, adoring, or a <br />
combination of those three. It was beautiful. And having his 'stand-in-Kaylee' by his side <br />
made it all the more sweet. He actually took Isabelle's arm and -strolled- through the <br />
park, the dogs being submissive and surrendering to him on sight. Some children inched <br />
closer while others inched away, but all were held by his presence and of course Isabelle's. <br />
<br />
Isabelle didn't know if she'd ever have this kind of alone time with Master again and said, <br />
&quot;Master, I'm, honored you accepted Alpha Female's suggestion that I go with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just being careful 'Belle.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;All the same, thank you...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's nothing.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two came to the dental office with time to spare and entered, of course having to <br />
hunch down and go side ways through the small door to the waiting room. Of course all <br />
the couches were two small. A small boy with his mother there to get his cavities filled did <br />
not look happy, he licked on a candy for assurance. The sight of the wolves made him <br />
might hard, causing his sore tooth to flare up and him to cry out in pain. He began sucking <br />
a minute or so later. <br />
<br />
The two wolves sat down cross legged after Jensen had informed them of being there. The <br />
nurse looked at the same on the paper, then at the giant wolf, then at the name again, <br />
and wandered back in a daze to tell the doctor they were here. <br />
<br />
A couple minutes later, the nurse said, &quot;The-the doctor shall see you now...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen gesture for Isabelle to wait here and did as Master commanded. Jensen moved <br />
carefully through the human sized hallway and into the dental room proper, closing the <br />
door behind him.  The Doctor who had recommended the orthodontist who had done <br />
Jennifer's braces took one look at the giant grinning wolf and said in alarm, &quot;J-Jennifer <br />
Smith?! I-is that -you-?!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;So you do know it's me?&quot; Jensen asked, wondering if he had just stepped on a landmine. <br />
<br />
The Doctor said, &quot;I-I recognize my own work!&quot; Jensen remembered Jensen had been <br />
grinning when Jensen had come in.  &quot;But what is this?! What are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Pearl where are you going?&quot; Alexandra asked calmly of the she wolf with the same name <br />
as her fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just going out for some air, I'll be back in a bit.&quot; Pearl excused herself and left the <br />
female's den.  She went right to the male's den, looked inside and instantly left. She began <br />
walking down the hallways glancing inside and walking past. She walked past the <br />
bathroom and glanced inside, walked past and then backpedaled and looked inside again <br />
and sniffed. <br />
<br />
She took a step inside, and saw the shape hidden behind the drab (mostly there to keep <br />
the water from getting in everything in the house now that doors off the bathrooms were <br />
gone, since none of the wolves gave a first thought to taking a dump in view of their <br />
fellows who happened by now). <br />
<br />
&quot;Zackery?&quot; She asked, sniffing the air again. There was no response, she sniffed the air <br />
again and pulled back the drab. Inside was the charcoal black male wolf, holding a small <br />
ice pack to between his legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Pearl.&quot; He whispered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You remember my name?&quot; Pearl asked surprised. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. And the gray one who also mated with me last night was Alexandra. Not counting <br />
Iesbella and Hope of course. I remember the name of anyone I've mated with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's nice...&quot; Pearl said unsure. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's the least I can do... it's what I was remade to do after all... just as you were remade to <br />
serve the Alpha Male weren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All of us were.&quot; Pearl responded sitting down on the throne next the tub. <br />
<br />
&quot;So it seems... so tell me, was I that bad in bed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Pearl said breathing in deep, &quot;You were absolutely wonderful. But Nicole said that <br />
none of us were to mate with you until you've shown you respect and are loyal to master <br />
and show respect to the rest of the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roger and Lawrence were made to serve the females of the pack too, they currently lack <br />
the traits to please you all greatly... Nick and I currently do. It's for the best of the pack.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But Nicole-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't in charge. Like she said herself, we're all equal, all subordinates. She's the one taking <br />
power that isn't hers, not me. She's deviated from her purpose. Not to mention she's <br />
trying to keep Nick all to herself when he's supposed to belong to all of you like I do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Pearl blinked, she really hadn't thought about it that way before. &quot;Maybe... I guess... but...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Come closer.&quot; <br />
<br />
It had the opposite effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am in no shape to do anything thanks to Nicole, there would be nothing to fear anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pearl reversed her action. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how do I smell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You smell nice... very nice... just smelling you somehow just makes me feel better... <br />
relaxed, better about myself...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was remade to service all of you wasn't I?  And you're a lovely Pearl... I enjoyed you last <br />
night too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was my first time you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... it was mine too...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zackery laughed, &quot;Something we both have in common.&quot; Zackery gently put a hand on her <br />
shoulder, &quot;You know, Jensen really -was- my best friend before this all started.  And I've <br />
got to admire everything he's managed to do with the game, he's taken something made <br />
for petty spite and figured out how to use it to his full advantage!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is Master.&quot; Pearl nodded. Zackery pulled her a little closer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you really like me in bed Pearl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I did... I-I actually was looking for you..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Zack asked coyly, &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don't remember.&quot; Pearl lied. &quot;Maybe I was worried Nicole hurt you too badly.&quot; She lied <br />
again. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's very sweet of you.&quot; Zackery said. And Pearl liked hearing that. &quot;For the record, I <br />
could never challenge Jesen, not with you and everyone swore to defend him and protect <br />
him with their lives. It's a nice fantasy but sadly like all of Glendale with wolf ears it <br />
wouldn't realistically work out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pearl started at that but didn't run away and didn't think of running away. &quot;Is that so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much yes. But Jensen taught by example, make the best and biggest use of any <br />
situation you find yourself in. Instead of going on a rampage and being gunned down by <br />
police or breaking down and going out to live in the woods he DID something with the <br />
power in his hands and look at this! Only two nights later, and he has all this! All his!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He is the master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's also not here right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Pearl spoke meekly, looking surprised, concerned, worried, and unsure. <br />
<br />
&quot;He left with Iesbella to get his teeth fixed going outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wasn't worried about anyone seeing him, apparently the game keeps people from <br />
seeing us as anything more than unique rather than something than shouldn't exist... He'll <br />
be safe.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The point is. He's not here right now to please you Pearl even if he could... but I am... <br />
sadly Nicole's rendered that a little impossible... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad.&quot; Pearl said completely honestly. <br />
<br />
&quot;So please, just come here and let me feel your body and you can feel mine in return <br />
again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds good.&quot; Pearl said as she let herself be taken into Zackery's arms. <br />
<br />
She breathed in his scent, intentionally breathing in deep. She LET it enter her brain, she <br />
WANTED it to fill her lungs, she WANTED it to enveloped her, she WANTED it to absorb <br />
everything that was her and make her something new. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are beautifully my lovely pearl..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Pearl whispered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sweet Master!&quot; Both wolves turned to the silver/gray pattern June standing in the <br />
doorway looking very surprised and alarmed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pearl.. what-what.. what are you doing?! Nicole said-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nicole isn't our leader, and isn't Alpha or Beta female.&quot; Pearl said, &quot;She doesn't command <br />
us.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;BUT -- you heard what he said about Megan's brother!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And he was... right...&quot; Pearl said simply without malice or hate or even icy indifference. <br />
<br />
June looked disbelieving and turned to run. Pearl leaped and tackled her and looked one <br />
way then the other to make sure no one saw or heard them and dragged June inside the <br />
bath room and pulled her behind the shower curtain and pulled it shut. <br />
<br />
&quot;June...&quot; Pearl said, &quot;I have a question to ask you. Transform or Dare.&quot; <br />
<br />
June's eye shot open wide with alarm. Pearl had her claws closed around June's muzzle. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll let your muzzle go a second before your time is up so it'll count, you won't have time <br />
to make trouble before you get stuck with both.&quot; Pearl said as Zack helped hold her down. <br />
<br />
Finally fifty eight seconds on the dot Pearl let go. <br />
<br />
June said, &quot;DARE!&quot; <br />
<br />
Pearl said at once, &quot;You will forget any negative thought you've had about Zackery, any <br />
new negative thought you have will dissolve instantly. You will defend and protect Zackery <br />
from anyone who attacks him except the Alphas and Betas. You will verbally defend him. <br />
And you'll back me up when I do the same. You'll act in no way suspicious or inconsistent <br />
that'll get anyone's attention about any of this. You won't communicate what you saw here <br />
in the bathroom to anyone. You will listen to what Zackery says and what I say. You'll <br />
cover for me when someone asks where my turn went if it's found out.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Pearl let go. June didn't struggle or try to get away anymore. <br />
<br />
Pearl hugged herself feeling mortified, &quot;What have I done?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack hugged her, &quot;Proven your an individual, one above the rest. Willing to take things into <br />
your own hands for the good of the pack. You've done nothing wrong. Nothing at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Pearl replied. <br />
<br />
June said, &quot;Can I come closer too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear.&quot; Zack said, &quot;You can.&quot; <br />
<br />
Half an hour later June and Pearl washed off Zack's scent very carefully, leaving none of it <br />
on them just in case Nicole asked questions. With that, both she-wolves returned to the <br />
den, as Zackery did the same.</p>
