<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... You saw what you thought was a pink spirit? It was a kind of ghostly apparition that looked like an elf made of pink... whatever ghosts are made of. Then you saw a few more of different colors and they seemed to be moving closer to you... With no one in sight you ran to the kitchen where you knew someone probably was there since the young once asked you to get her juice. Only problem was there were some gathering in your path as well. <br />
<br />
You sighed and thought &quot;Well these are spirits so let&#39;s try punching them with magic.&quot; You tried to feel a similar magical tingle you did when you fought in the Colosseum and instead of trying to think weaken you tried to think &quot;Destroy&quot; and threw your punch. Your fist just went through the spirit you decided to punch that was purplish. As your punch went through you passed through that particular spirit and as it entered your body you tripped forward. Seeing the other spirits around going towards you, you decided to get up but found that now your pants were rather loose and falling off your hips. Where you shrinking? Regardless of what it did you were getting away from the others. You managed to run from the other spirits hands on pants and you entered the kitchen. There  was an elf there preparing some food that just looked at you as you barged in gasping for breathe from sprinting the  kitchen. <br />
<br />
The elf asked &quot;What exactly are you doing here?&quot; <br />
<br />
You gasped and said &quot;Ghosts in the halls! Weird an-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, why have you came to the kitchen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The young one asked for a glass of juice! Are those ghosts a regular occurrence or something?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get the juice, just do your job as a bodyguard and fight off those  ghosts of yours...&quot; said the elf somewhat condescendingly as the spirits started phasing through the walls. <br />
<br />
&quot;I tried that!&quot; you yelled out as the pink ghost got closer. You thought &quot;Oh whatever, no time to even argue got to face this thing.&quot;  You tried to put magic into your punch and as your punch went into the spirit the spirit was absorbed into your fist. It dispersed in your body doing something, but you had little time to think as more spirits came in and ran into you as well. There was no force, but you tripped backward and fell flat on your ass as the spirits started doing their best to possess you. The more spirits that entered you the more you could feel  your body warp and change. You weren&#39;t exactly sure what they were doing. <br />
<br />
A few seconds after the spirit attack you heard that elf say &quot;The glass of juice for the young one, young miss.&quot; unsure what was going  on you picked yourself up as your pants had completely fallen down. The elf held a hand in front of him and chanted something as a magic mirror was conjured in front of you so you could see what you now looked like. A rather small young girl that had small hints of orc in her, but was more elfish. <br />
<br />
You felt really tired and took the glass of some kind of juice and walked your way back to your sister&#39;s room. You knocked on the door and heard your sister say &quot;Come in!&quot; You opened the door entered to see a room that your first thought was &quot;Soft&quot; followed by &quot;Pink&quot;, with there being a nice fuzzy rug, the walls were not made of any stone or plaster but seemed soft as well, and there was just a hint to the whole room. <br />
<br />
One step inside the room and it was like reality looked the other way as one or two dozen elves just suddenly materialized and yelled &quot;Surprise!!!&quot; To which you just stood dumbfounded. You had just been rapped into a little girl by some spirits on your way to get some juice for your sister, and now it&#39;s like your in a surprise party? You heard a bunch of giggles and small whispers about the special magic used. Then one elf pulled out their wallet to give another some money mumbling over how you didn&#39;t faint or spill the juice. For clarification you asked &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; <br />
<br />
Your mother who was around said &quot;So most everyone in our family wanted to do something fun for your first day here. A bit of a hazing to have a few laughs. A bit rude if you ask me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Another elf went &quot;Hey it has a practical purpose as well! All part of his magic training!&quot; <br />
<br />
Confused you asked &quot;But wait didn&#39;t they all hate me or something?&quot; <br />
<br />
The elf who was talking about magic training who you looked at closer to see he was a bit more big and rugged said &quot;Oh don&#39;t get me wrong you have all the reason to think that. You were sent to the Colosseum for our family to save public appearance, your father was an absolutely despicable orc that deserved whatever cruel fate came to him, and elves and orcs haven&#39;t been known to get along... However you are still family, and the fact that your half orc just makes you that much more interesting. Looking forward to help you with that bodyguard training, we&#39;ll start tomorrow.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your mother said &quot;We elves make a habit of appearing regal in public, but a lot of the time we enjoy having silly fun every now and then...&quot; <br />
<br />
A heckler elf said &quot;Everyone but you!&quot; thinking back your mother&#39;s stammering in the past probably was her trying to not think about how everyone was more curious, but still enjoyed your presence. and she didn&#39;t want to stop your little surprise party. Some food was passed around and you got to know some more of your family, although it was mostly their faces as you couldn&#39;t remember all their names. <br />
<br />
Sitting next to the  rugged elf you asked &quot;So any idea when this... little girl thing will wear off.&quot; <br />
<br />
The rugged elf whose name was Pugn said &quot;Oh that&#39;ll wear off as soon as your magic is strong enough to resist it. The faster you get stronger with magic the sooner all the random charms on you will wear off. Call it we get a laugh and see when you get stronger and stronger.&quot; After an hour or so they let you get back to your room to rest and get ready for the next day of training.</p>
