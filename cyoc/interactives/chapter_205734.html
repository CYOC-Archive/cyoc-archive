<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of the few nice things about living in a city was the number of shops that almost seemed stacked on top of each other. The game shop was about a mile and a half away, but there were still plenty of places they could stop along the way. However, walking next to Lancer, Troy couldn&#39;t help but notice the consistent looks people would give the two of them as they passed by. Not because Lancer was a giant lion man, but rather there was almost a knowing smile behind the look.<br />
<br />
Troy felt an unease rush over him. Maybe it&#39;s because he could see Lancer&#39;s massive paw swinging next to him. All he wanted to do was grab it and hold it as they walked down the street. But would that be alright? Would Lancer even want to hold his hand? Or were they just a sex on the side thing? The thoughts compounded as the two walked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s on your mind?&quot; Lancer asked. He looked down at the human with a strained smile.<br />
<br />
Troy instantly froze up. &quot;Nothing,&quot; he answered without thinking. Then quickly changed his answer. &quot;I mean... The clothes shop is just around the corner. I just hope they have something your size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Lancer laughed. He raised his massive arms in a flex. The sleeves ran down his forearms showing off the impressive arms. People around were looking as he drew more attention around himself. &quot;You think your small human clothes won&#39;t be able to fit me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No!&quot; Troy felt the eyes of the people on the street looking at them. Most had a strange knowing smile on their face. While others chuckled to themselves. Troy grabbed onto Lancer&#39;s arms and tried to pull them down, failing until Lancer relaxed his bicep. &quot;It&#39;s just... I don&#39;t know... But we&#39;re almost there. Just a few more storefronts.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two continued down the street to see a big open window with athletic gear on mannequins. Bright colors filled the window with a sleek red hanging sign with white letters reading, &#39;Sports Outlet.&#39; Troy took a breath and led the way. He&#39;d passed this store hundreds of times and knew full well they carried stuff big enough for bodybuilders to wear. Though, Lancer was quite a bit bigger than a bodybuilder, he had to wonder if the small reality changes had made enough of a difference to make the even larger size at least somewhat standard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome,&quot; an athletic looking man approached the door. He looked to be fairly fit and had a nice tight-fitting shirt that seemed to mold around his muscular chest. &quot;And what are we looking for today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lancer was first to speak up. &quot;Apparently this isn&#39;t standard dressing for a DnD session,&quot; he said, showing off his billowing clothes. &quot;And we were wondering if you have anything in my size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; the attendant had to lean his head back a bit to properly look Lancer in the face. This was clearly uncommon for the man as he was almost a head taller than Troy. However, that also meant he was about a head shorter than Lancer as well. &quot;We don&#39;t get too many of creatures your size, but I think we should be able to find something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Troy realized it, Lancer was being led off to the other side of the store. He&#39;d zoned out for just a second, and Lancer was gone, looking at shirts and shorts. The employee picked up a couple of sleeveless shirts, but Lancer seemed to settle with a couple of with sleeves. However, the employee leaned in and whispered something into Lancer&#39;s ear and looked over at Troy. That&#39;s when Lancer picked up the sleeveless shirts. Troy could almost hear, &#39;Thatta boy,&#39; from the employee as he slapped Lancer&#39;s ass and herded him into the changing room. <br />
<br />
Troy found himself awkwardly pacing around the other side of the store near the shoes section. He squeezed his magical book for a bit of comfort. &#39;Right...&#39; a desire to test out the mass transform had suddenly arose in him again. Even though he didn&#39;t have reason to believe that the officer had heard him say it, he still wanted to test it out again. It seemed a bit odd that a spell like that would exist. But thinking about it, if he were in a crowded area and needed a plan of escape, what better way to go than making everyone anthro? Then he could sneak out through the crowd because the other guy wouldn&#39;t know which creature he was. But the cleanup afterwards would be hell... &#39;Only as a last resort...&#39; he told himself. <br />
<br />
However, the desire only grew as he whispered, &#39;mass half&#39; as quietly as he could. Then quickly hid behind one of the clothing racks. Troy smiled as he watched his nails turn black and then sharpen. The feeling of fur running up his arms and down his legs was always amazing. The bright orange and black stripes looked so cool. Same as his ears rounded out and drifted to the top of his skull. He wiggled them a bit to feel their changed shape. &quot;So coool...&quot; his extending jawline smiled showing off the razor sharp teeth in his mouth. <br />
<br />
Troy did his best to hide as he looked over the shelving at the employee who was helping Lancer. There stood a massive tiger man as well. White and black stripes covered his body instead of the orange Troy preferred. Though, compared to Troy, this man was still absolutely jacked. His body strained the black sleeveless shirt he was wearing and his black shorts with a bright red stripe molded perfectly around his bubble butt. Looking in the mirror, Troy couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit odd as he saw his relatively thin tiger form compared to the massive monster standing on the other side of the store. It was also so weird how much their faces differed as well. Somehow, the employee maintained his strong masculine jaw while Troy&#39;s still looked to look significantly weaker in comparison.<br />
<br />
But Troy did not expect to see a bright orange tabby cat step out of the changing room. He had to stifle his laughter as the short little orange cat stepped out of the dressing room and showed off the athletic clothing he was about to buy. Lancer still looked jacked for a creature so small, but he was now a whole foot shorter than the tiger man he&#39;d been towering over. However, all that confidence that Lancer held, was not wavering in the slightest. He still walked as though he was a man far taller than he currently was.<br />
<br />
Lancer looked in Troy&#39;s direction and Troy quickly said, &quot;shape,&quot; returning to his human form. <br />
<br />
&quot;How do I look?&quot; Lancer asked. Not a hint of acknowledgement that he was now looking up at Troy instead of down. <br />
<br />
Troy continued to stifle his laughter as he saw the small orange tabby cat show off his sleeveless shirt. It barely could have been a small when he&#39;d been looking at clothing that would have been dragging along the floor before he&#39;d stepped into the dressing room. &quot;Good,&quot; he said. &quot;You look good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; the employee nearly had to get on one knee to elbow him. &quot;Told you he&#39;d like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Lancer went for another affirmation. His tail swished back and forth as his golden eyes stared intently up at Troy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Troy nodded. You look really good.&quot; The strangeness of the situation was starting to wear off. Though, he was going to turn Lancer back into the Leonin the first chance he got. Just after he pulled out his credit card and purchased the clothing.</p>
